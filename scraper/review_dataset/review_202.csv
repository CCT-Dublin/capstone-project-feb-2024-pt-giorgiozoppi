202,"Best Hotel to stay in Dublin, for every reason.","The College Green Hotel in Dublin was the perfect home for our 4-night visit to Dublin. The staff, whether front door, concierge, lobby or room were all outstanding people. The room was immaculate and sparkling. For all that, the best part of our stay at the College Green was its location.

Located right downtown across the street from both Trinity College and Temple Bar, we walked everywhere except Guinness Storehouse and Kilmainham Gaol but the Concierge had a taxi to those tours for us within minutes.",5,2024,10,17
202,"Great hotel, don't look any further","We are always hesitant to stay at chain hotels and usually go for the smaller boutique hotels.  However, this hotel hit it out of the park!
Location, location, location.  Could not have been better.  In walking distance to all areas that a tourist would want to visit, including the train station where we took a great day trip to Howth for the famous Cliff walk (don't miss!)
The room was spacious, clean, with a comfy bed and had a great bathroom/shower.
Some rooms faced the street with amazing views and some into the interior courtyard.  We much prefer the natural lighting of the outside and the wonderful views. Noise was not an issue since the windows were completely sound proof. 
The breakfast was amazing.  Lots of wonderful selections in a beautiful dining room.
The staff was friendly and accommodating.  We did the afternoon tea and while it was costly, it was a very special treat.
I would stay here time and time again.",5,2024,10,15
202,Amazing hotel and food,"This hotel was beautiful and conveniently located in Dublin. What made the stay here probably the best experience I've ever had at a hotel was the staff members. They went above and beyond for just about everything. I was blown away with how nice and friendly the staff were to me while I was there. The food for breakfast was delicious and the staff working were helpful and nice. The staff working at The Atrium Lounge were amazing as well. I caught a bad cold when I was in Dublin and went there for tea a few times. One of the staff members new just the tea to make to help me feel better. I went to the afternoon tea as well, which I know nothing about but wanted the experience. The staff had wonderful recommendations on teas to try and were extremely friendly. They went above and beyond, not to mention the food was amazing. The hotel itself is very clean and they came to clean my room quite often.
Overall I would absolutely stay here again and it's mainly based off how nice the staff members were during my whole stay, which I was there for a week.",5,2024,10,15
202,Stellar staff - great location,"Fantastic location. Lovely, clean, spacious and comfortable room.

Helpful, friendly & professional staff.

Great breakfast...

A massive shout out and thanks to one of the front door staff. I was standing outside trying fruitlessly to get an uber to the airport during a heavy rainstorm on a busy morning and he came out to ask if I needed help. He then literally stood in the middle of the busy street in the pouring rain trying to flag me a taxi and didn't give up until he succeeded. He was absolutely drenched and then proceeded to hold the door and load in my soaking wet luggage. I had no cash (note the uber plan) and apologized that I couldn't even tip him. He was smiling and gracious  through it all. I think his name was Rez or similar and he deserves a big raise. (-; Many thanks for saving the day so that I didn't miss my flight.",5,2024,10,14

202,Great Hotel to Stay in the Heart of the City,"Myself and my husband Stayed in your Beautiful Hotel in September 2024.From the time we arrived we got a very warm welcome from Stephen the Doorman and he was very friendly. 
Our check in was very quick and again a warm welcome. 
We stayed in the Library Suite it was beautiful and would love to stay again.

Breakfast was excellent as u have the usual buffet and also u have a menu that u can choose from . Some things on menu u had to pay extra .The choice was great.

There is alot to do a round Dublin as this Hotel is in the Heart of the City and walking distance to Grafton Street and next to Trinity College and Stephen Green 10 minutes walk. We had a Brilliant time as there where many great pubs to visit .üçÄI highly recommend this hotel ü•∞",5,2024,09,22
202,Birthday party,"The culinary experience was exceptional, and the staff demonstrated remarkable professionalism and friendliness. I would like to express my sincere gratitude to Nikhil for his outstanding service. I will definitely be returning. Thank you...",5,2024,09,21
202,Great experience,"Lovely food and great service, Nikhil was very friendly and helpful. Came for my friends birthday and they were kind enough to decorate a desser plate for him which he really enjoyed‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶..",5,2024,09,21

202,"Great Hotel, Questionable Bar","I stayed from the 8th of Sept. to the 21st. Didn't get a free upgrade on the room which sucks but that's availability. The staff was incredibly friendly, especially a lovely woman named Eva and another man who I unfortunately do not remember the name of, but both were great. The only reason I have to give it a 4 star is because of The Mint Bar.

 On Sept. 10th, they must of thought I was drunk as the two men intentially tried to charge me for my drinks twice then tried to play it off like they were in training, but we're very embarrassed when I called them out. Sometimes if I ordered a double only a single would come. I called down and they didn't charge me, but the next time I come I'm avoiding that bar/ordering drinks from room service. It felt so petty every time.

Its a great hotel with great service, friendly staff and well appointed rooms with very comfortable beds and pillows.",4,2024,09,21
202,"Great stay, loved it!!!","Amazing Hotel.  The BEST location!  All of the staff were friendly and helpful.  Beautiful room with everything you could want.

202,Great hotel,"The College Green is well-located; has a very friendly and accommodating staff, and a good breakfast buffet. I was travelling solo so really appreciated the special attention. I had dinner one night at the main restaurant and had an excellent Salmon. I would definitely recommend to anyone coming to Dublin.",4,2024,09,18
202,"Great Location, bad smell.","Fantastic location but room #445 was terribly musty smelling and had a view of a roof peak‚Ä¶nothing else.  When I called to front desk to ask for a different room they said they were fully booked.  I asked for a dehumidifier and they sent housekeeping up with a spray bottle of what I assume was Febreeze which I asked them not to do as I am very allergic to it.  Spoke with other members of our group and a number of them said their rooms smelled musty and had bad views.

We did have Afternoon Tea in the Atrium which was very good except for the dessert selections.  Service was very good and the sandwiches and scones were amazing.

The location is perfect, right next to Trinity College which is why you might pick this hotel.  I suggest you ask a few questions when booking about room location and check out the room first, before agreeing to it.",3,2024,09,17
202,Anniversary celebration,"Just back from a stay at the magnificent College Green Hotel where celebrated our wedding anniversary! I cannot recommend this hotel enough from the charming  concierge who greets you on arrival to wonderful staff at check in. Our room was quite spacious & the bed was so comfortable it felt like sleeping on a cloud. We ate lunch in the atrium which is so tranquil & the service was excellent. As part of our stay I booked dinner in the restaurant where we had a 5 course tasting menu with wine pairing! Hat‚Äôs off to the chef the food was delicious & really complimented the wine & the service & attention to detail was definitely 5 Star. We finished  off the night with a night cap downstairs in the Mint  Bar, this hotel is full of character & luxury,I can‚Äôt wait to return  & do it all again sometime .",5,2024,09,17
202,Fantastic location and first class service,"We spent 3 nights at this hotel at the start of a two week trip to Ireland.  We booked the hotel for the night before we arrived so we could land at 6am and have a place to sleep and refreshen up before taking on Dublin. The location is central to everything, and the hotel is first class.  I highly recommend it if staying in the city",5,2024,09,16
202,A great location for a holiday in Dublin,"We spent 3 nights here on our recent trip to Dublin, and could not have had a better experience.  Our 3rd floor room looked down on the atrium. The most outstanding feature is the location - you can walk almost anywhere you want to go as a tourist.  Our room was spacious and quiet, the king sized bed was extremely comfortable, the hotel staff were all very friendly and the cleanliness was top of the line.  We looked at several hotels in the Dublin area and found the rates here to be very competitive.  I would highly recommend this hotel to any couple lucky enough to experience a few days as a tourist in Dublin.",5,2024,09,12
202,College Green Good Choice,"Everything about the hotel was outstanding.  The location was located in the heart of Dublin attractions and Pubs. College Green room was well appointed and comfortable. The restaurant and bar areas offered great food, and the Atrium restaurant offered a wonderful afternoon tea. The staff was professional and the concierge staffs were very helpful! We would definitely stay there again.",5,2024,09,10
202,Attending confernece in Banking Hall,"The hotel was absolutely gorgeous, with a rich history that provided the perfect backdrop for attending the conference. Everything was impeccably organised, from the food to the cleanliness and overall beauty of the space. The staff were wonderful‚Äîalways kind and smiling‚Äîespecially Nikhil, who was incredibly professional and warm. The washrooms were spotless, well-maintained, and fragrant, adding to the overall experience. The food was simply sumptuous, making the stay even more enjoyable. Highly recommend this hotel for both comfort and service!",5,2024,09,06
202,"Can't beat the location, service, and breakfast ","I recently completed an amazing 5-night stay at The College Green Hotel in Dublin and absolutely loved it! Initially nervous about its proximity to the lively Temple Bar District and its bustling nightlife, I was pleasantly surprised. Despite being on the 2nd floor, I experienced minimal noise disturbances day and night. The hotel's location is superb, just a stone's throw from O'Connell Bridge, Trinity College, and convenient public transportation options, making it ideal for exploring the city on foot or by tram or bus.

The service was generally excellent, though I encountered a few minor issues with my room key and toilet water levels. The included breakfast was fantastic, offering both √† la carte and buffet options. The concierge team was incredibly helpful, adding to the overall positive experience.

During my stay, I particularly enjoyed the live music at the hotel's Mint Bar from Thursday to Saturday. For additional entertainment, Temple Bar's pubs, renowned for their nightly live music, are just across the street, reminiscent of the music scene of New Orleans' French Quarter.

Having also toured Dublin via a Hop-On Hop-Off bus, I appreciated The College Green Hotel's central location over other options like the Shelbourne. It's perfect for exploring the city's attractions on foot or participating in tour group activities.

I can't imagine a better place to stay in Dublin. The College Green Hotel offers everything I could want in terms of location and service, making my visit truly memorable.",5,2024,09,05
202,Great location but hotel has major deficiencies.,"It‚Äôs a decent hotel with an unbeatable location but it is beset with shortcomings.  First, about half the rooms face a courtyard and are dimly lit.  We were on a tour and everyone who had an interior windowless room had the same complaint:  there‚Äôs virtually no air conditioning.   I set the a/c on 65 as I like it cold and the room was about 75.  They sent a serviceman who came by and said the room won‚Äôt get any colder, sorry.  I complained at the front desk and they promised to change out our room but despite our repeated follow ups they refused despite their promises to the contrary.   Ultimately they gave me a weak fan.  See pics.  We did not sleep well for four days and were exhausted when we left. 

Other problems:  the hallways, interior rooms and bedding had a musty odor.  There‚Äôs just not enough ventilation.  They need to invest in dehumidifiers and stronger condensers.  

The TV in my room was hard to watch. See pics. 

The shower on max was hot but I like a hotter shower. 

The breakfast was really good and again the location was terrific.  But I can‚Äôt recommend this hotel.  If you book, demand an exterior room (that is, with a window) and under no circumstances accept room 118.  

Again, the location is ideal and if you don‚Äôt mind sleeping in a warm and humid room this is an OK choice.  But five stars it is not.",3,2024,09,05
202,Classy property in a convenient location. Excellent restaurant on property.,"Very good hotel close to Trinity College, Grafton Street, Temple Bar area and O'Connell Bridge. There is an excellent restaurant on property. Very helpful and friendly concierge service. Someone is always available to assist! Lovely atrium bar and ballrooms/meeting rooms.",4,2024,09,04
202,Very nice breakfast for your birthday day!,"Danusia and Isabela were super nice, kind and proffesionals. 
Thank you so much for made the breakfast more enjoyable. 
Danusia was lovely giving a birthday wishes in spanish :).
Breakfast was delicious and loved the fresh juices and house made scones. 
 
Kind regards

Lizette",5,2024,09,01
202,Very comfortable home base in Dublin,"The College Green Hotel made for a great home base for my long weekend in Dublin. It‚Äôs walking distance from every place we wanted to visit in town. Everything‚Äôs shiny and new inside, and every single hotel staff person made me feel at home. I‚Äôll be staying here again the next time I‚Äôm able to visit.",5,2024,09,01
202,Lovely stay in Dublin. In the action but nice and quiet,"College Green Dublin (formerly the Westin) is a well placed hotel that does not attract the rabble of Temple Bar area, but puts you within five steps of all the action. Excellent staff on hand to make your stay easy and wonderful. Beds are amazing. These I suspect are the Westin Hotel beds from its former brand and they are simply the best hotel bed money can buy. So if a super king comfy luxury bed is important to you‚Ä¶ stay here. Our room was 236, just a standard room, no special view or anything. But it was beautifully appointed, quiet and cozy. Top tip for parking if you‚Äôre driving to the hotel. The car valet drop off is on the corner of the hotel in Fleet Street. There‚Äôs a small drop off area for about three or four cars. The bell hops monitor it from reception by CCTV, and for us buy the time I had got out of the car the bell hops was there with a trolley to help us check in. Valet parking is 35Euro a night. I recommend it. While there is cheaper overnight parking from 14 Euro a night, they are a bit of a hike away. And the Q-Park car parks are 47 Euro for 25 hours (daylight robbery). So the hotel valet service is all in all good value and makes your stay seamless.",5,2024,09,01
202,Luxury in Dublin's Historic City Centre,"What an amazing experience to stay in this hotel. The staff are really friendly and go above and beyond with their level of service to make one feel special and valued. We had really amazing treatment at the College Green Hotel, and thank all the staff for making us feel like royalty.",5,2024,08,26
202,Best Hotel in Dublin,"Impeccable service during a week that was overloaded with FSU fans. Everyone at the hotel handled the massive influx of guests with grace and professionalism. A very special shoutout to Deppie, Yasmin and Stephen for going above and beyond! This hotel is smack dab in the middle of all things Dublin. We will be back!",5,2024,08,25
202,American football weekend in Dublin-  top notch service,"College Green was a first class experience at a beautiful hotel in a great location across the street from the Temple Bar area.  

It was our first time in Dublin during an American football weekend and the hotel was extremely busy. However, they bent over backwards to provide top notch service from
Housekeeping to front desk to bartenders.  We missed doing tea in the Atrium, it looked amazing (next time) .  

Nina R at the Atrium bar was the most lovely person and took great care of us‚Äî she really knows how to provide 5 star service with a smile on her face. We loved the bartenders and DJ at the Mint (Friday and Saturday night).  Overall an amazing trip and we would stay here again!",5,2024,08,25
202,Can‚Äôt wait to come back!,"We absolutely loved our stay at College Green! It was centrally located to all the spots we had on our list to visit in Dublin, and is about a block from the iconic Temple Bar. There are a ton of great restaurants, bars and coffee shops within a short walk from the hotel. The staff was so welcoming! Kadirhan was especially helpful and accommodating! He helped us to our room and made sure we had everything we could need or want during our stay! The room was very comfortable and spacious. I wish we booked our stay longer! This is definitely where we will be staying every time we come to Dublin",5,2024,08,24
202,Wonderful hotel,Thank you to all at The College Green Hotel Dublin for a wonderful stay on August 20th with my friends.  We had a fabulous room and a beautiful breakfast. The location is superb and all the staff very helpful. A special word of thanks to Joanne & Doiran.,5,2024,08,21
202,Nikkil is Awesome,"Had the best dining experience with Nikkil! His service and communication skills were top notch. Walked us through everything and recommended some local spots. If you‚Äôre in the area, highly recommended. Afternoon tea was splendid. Atmosphere is something special.",5,2024,08,21
202,College Green Hotel,Got a room upgrade as a Marriott Titanium member. One of the best properties I've stayed in. Bed was comfortable and room was just awesome. Hotel was not pretentious and staff were all friendly and helpful. The location is perfect and ideal for walking to most attractions and restaurants. The Mint bar in the hotel is really nice with knowledgeable bar tenders and live music was a nice touch. Definitely will be back next time i'm in Dublin.,5,2024,08,20
202,Excellent Customer Service,"We stayed at College Green Hotel on August 5th and 6th and found the service was outstanding. I want to particularly mention 3 staff members who went out of their way to provide us with excellent customer service. They are Nina in the dining area, Luis, concierge, and David, hospitality. They made our experience at the hotel so enjoyable, and we appreciate it.",5,2024,08,20
202,Another lovely stay!,"The hotel has a different name,  and different livery. However, it is still the same lovely hotel, in a most perfect location, with the most delightful staff, and most importantly, the best doorman in all of Dublin - Stephen..  we cannot wait to return soon..",5,2024,08,20
202,Wonderful introduction to Ireland,"i spent two nights at the College Green Hotel - one after my arrival from the US and one after my tour of Southwest Ireland. Kudos to the staff who arranged an early check-in.  falling into bed, felt like falling into a cloud  - it was heavenly.  All the  staff I encountered were friendly and helpful.  I‚Äôd especially like to recognize Deppie at the front desk who went out of her way to resolve a billing issue I had upon checking out.  all in all, a perfect welcome to the Emerald  Isle and a lovely way to end my stay there.",5,2024,08,17
202,Great Hotel,"Service, rooms and food all excellent. Bed and pillow wonderful. We ate dinner one night in the main restaurant and rate it highly. Breakfast was buffet style but you could also order a la carte. Everything we needed and more. Hotel is very close to Trinity College, the Temple Bar area and maybe a 15 minute walk to all the major museums. Belfast castle is 10 minutes.",5,2024,08,17
202,Fantastic Hotel,"We had a fantastic stay at the College Green Hotel, it is a beautiful hotel. Thank you to all staff, especially Alan Brophy, front of house manager, who looked after us exceptionally well from the minute we arrived. Everyone was extremely helpful and friendly. We enjoyed a delicious lunch in the Atrium and the breakfast in the hotel was superb. Rooms were spacious, clean and very comfortable. The hotel is centrally located in Dublin city centre. It was a truly memorable stay and we look forward to returning again.",5,2024,08,12
202,Super fun trip to Dublin,"We stayed at the Dublin Inn for our 30th Anniversary. We had a jam packed 4 days. From the moment we arrived, the lady at the front desk got us into a gorgeous room with an early check in. We were surprised after we returned to our room that evening with a nice bottle of red wine, deserts and a very nice hand written card. The property is centrally located to everything. The people are so friendly, breakfast was delicious and the bar is gorgeous as well! Steven the bellman was super friendly and helpful. Luis Frias the concierge went Above and Beyond to help us with our tickets to the book of Kells, other things to do in Dublin, our bags‚Ä¶etc.  We have been talking to all of our friends about our wonderful experience at the College Green Hotel!",5,2024,08,10
202,Fabulous hotel great location,We had a great experience in this hotel the staff were very good and helpful especially Isabella who welcomed us each morning for breakfast and Patrick who made our evening meal very special and Jelena who's front of house manner was first class Chris and Antoinette,5,2024,08,10
202,Disappointingly different,"I have been going to The Westin now College Green for 10 years now. In my 10 years of staying here I have always been pleased to be greeted by pretty much the same door staff and concierge. They have always been helpful, professional, friendly, and most importantly knowledgeable of Dublin, where to go to eat, what tours to do and anything you could possibly ask, they would always know the answer. Friendly faces and always thanking us (I travel with my friend who has been coming for 15 years) for coming back and making sure we have everything we need. When we looked at booking again in August ‚Äì the thought of Stephen, David, Colm and Robert being there to greet us and make sure our stay was the best it could be, we didn‚Äôt hesitate to book. 
 
I was so disappointed and upset when we arrived to find out Colm & Robert ( who had been there for years ) were no longer employed, such a shame ,  they all seemed like a family, they all got on so well and they worked very hard and went above and beyond, every day- a real solid team . Thank God for Stephen & and David still being there,  they are the saving grace of the Hotel. Is this what happens when hotels change their name? Some bright spark decides to employ young people for the concierge who don‚Äôt know the area or Dublin at all , whoever made these decisions needs to get another job ‚Äì perhaps in Demolition,  because this is how the downward spiral of hotels starts ‚Äì when you take out the heart of the Hotel which is the loyal staff . THANK YOU, STEPHEN & DAVID, for still being there and I pray you are still there when we return in November otherwise we won‚Äôt not coming back again  :(",3,2024,08,09
202,Disappointed to say the least.,"I do not even know where to begin with this review. I first arrived July 28th for one night and then again Aug 2-4. 

Both rooms I stayed in were on the 5th floor and were recently remodeled. However, the beds both times were so uncomfortable. It was like sleeping on the floor that is how hard the mattresses were.  I definitely did not get a restful nights sleep any of the nights. I had to put two of the four pillows down on the mattresses for my body to lay on. 

Zero bathroom amenities such as dental kit, sewing kit etc were in my rooms which is not the Autograph standard. 

The shower on my Aug 2-4th, that was beyond unacceptable. There was absolutely zero angle sloping down to the drain and no lip on the shower edge to keep the water retained in the shower. I stepped out of the shower on the 3rd only to slip on a giant pool of water that was on the bathroom floor. I severely bruised my right hip to the point that it was extremely painful to even walk. Which limited my mobility to walk around and enjoy Dublin the night of Aug 3rd and most definitely made for a very uncomfortable flight home to the U.S. Aug 4th. 

Next, I would like to address the concierge issue at the hotel. I was shocked to hear of Colm and Robert no longer being at the hotel. These were two long term employees at the hotel who always went above and beyond their duties to make me feel welcome‚Äôd and at home. Both helped me out significantly when I was at the hotel over New Years this year when I had a major issue at hand with a Dublin resident that was very out of line with me.  The best part of the College Green hotel were the concierges and the exceptional service they provided to guests. I was extremely grateful to see that at least Stephen and David were still there at least.  The other concierges are not even from Ireland!!!! They provided zero help at all to me during my stay. Ritz I believe is his name, you can barely understand what he is even saying and he has no knowledge at all of Dublin, how to give directions to places, recommendations for restaurants etc. He is also very pompous and makes you feel you are bothering him when asking questions. I even overheard him in the restaurant telling a lady and her parents that their breakfast is not included and they have to pay!!!!!! How rude is that????? Then there was Luis, another non-Irish, who again has no knowledge at all of Dublin, restaurant recommendation for a great place to go for a quiet sit down meal‚Ä¶. The Boxty???? Seriously? A Temple Bar restaurant????? Ohhhhh but he for sure wants you to acknowledge him in your positive reviews on Trip Advisor because he tries giving you a business card to do so.  What in the heck is that about?!?!? Promoting yourself and asking the guest to mention you in their review???? In the 15 years I have stayed at this hotel I have never encountered such self promotion from staff. You want me to mention what a great job you‚Äôre doing at your actual responsibilities as a concierge??? That is just beyond unprofessional, especially at a 5 star hotel. 

How is College Green going to maintain their 5 star status by not acting like a 5 Star hotel? The hiring of foreign national, who have absolutely zero knowledge and of the city they are working in, or in this situation, knowledge of even places in Ireland as a whole, is detrimental to the hotel. Sending visitors to tourist traps is not acceptable. Colm and Robert, (as well as Dave d and Stephen) were/are from Ireland, know everywhere in Dublin and surrounding areas to recommend. All 4 gentlemen always went above and beyond to make guests feel welcome and appreciated. 

A serious review of overall hospitality must be done at this hotel from the top of the management down.  I was saddened to hear Joann was on vacation during my stay because at least she would have taken it under advisement.  Bring back Colm and Robert is the first thing. Second, fix your showers immediately so that no one else gets injured like I did. Third, review your mattresses for comfort levels. I have had a better nights sleep at Alofts than I did during my last stays at College Green.",2,2024,08,08
202,Excellent,"We throughly enjoyed our stay, it's a beautiful hotel in the centre of Dublin. We thought the rooms were clean and comfortable.

We were checked in by Lauryn who went out of her way to make our stay extra special - arranging a small happy birthday dessert plate to be left in our room.

Upon checkout Charlotte was also very friendly and helped us get our bags checked in for the day.",5,2024,08,06
202,5 star experience,"I still can't believe the wonderful 5 star experience we had in this fabulous hotel. From start to finish the staff were so helpful and friendly. The room was pure luxury, comfortable, clean and so spacious. A special thank you to Alan Brophy, the hotel's front of house manager who took care of every detail of our stay and made us feel like special guests. We enjoyed a fabulous lunch in the gorgeous Atrium and delicious breakfast in the hotel bar. I could not recommend College Green hotel enough. It's an ideal location in Dublin city centre. I can't wait to return someday.",5,2024,08,06
202,Thank you to Stephen!!,"Had a lovely night away with my friends, Stephen on the door of the hotel is the most welcoming man, I have stayed in your hotel numerous times and Stephen is always so friendly and welcoming each time it is so lovely to see a familiar face everytime I return. When checking out he could not do enough my myself and my friends! We will definitely be back!!",4,2024,08,06
202,Top Two Marriott Experience Ever!,"Superb - extremely friendly staff to a person. Breakfast was great. The staff there work so hard to create a pleasant experience. 

Very comfortable rooms with appreciated small touches like biscuits every day and turndown service with chocolates. Very clean - cleaners do a fantastic job. 

From the front door to the counter to the cleaning to the restaurant staff, everyone is so pleasant. 

And the location cannot be beaten. I walked to every site - and the longest walk was 30 minutes. I could have easily gotten a taxi, but I wanted to enjoy the sunshine. 

I love this hotel so much that I canceled one night at a different hotel on the return trip and rebooked The College Green when I saw in the app a room had become available.",5,2024,08,06
202,Outstanding Doorman,"I have been staying in this hotel for years, and the only thing that keeps bringing me back is Stephen the doorman he is the kindest, sweetest person I have ever met. His guest care from the minute you arrive is outstanding, nothing is a problem. I can't wait to bring my 9 year old daughter back to watch a show in Dublin before she goes back to school and of course stay here again.

Thank you so much Stephen see you soon.

Location is amazing",4,2024,07,09
202,A wonderful hotel in the middle of Dublin with access to lots of pubs/restaurants,"This is now one of my favorite hotels ever! The location is perfect if you want to see lots of Dublin & visit loads of pubs. It is a high end hotel (to me it was) with a doorman and a staffed concierge desk. It has a lovely restaurant that serves breakfast & dinner, too. There are a couple of lounges but I didn't visit them.

The hotel's location was very convenient for us when we took a 10-hour tour to get out of the city and see some of the countryside. The concierge desk had recommended a tour with Wild Rover Tours & it was a wonderful all-day experience that showed us 2 towns (Kilkenny and Glendalough) and an entertain demonstration of a Border Collie named Rob rounding up the sheep.

We had a 4-night stay during the time of Taylor Swift's visit (which we had no clue about). The first 2 nights of our stay were very reasonable at around 400euros per night. The last 2 were much more expensive, in the 750-850euro range. Lodging turned out to be scarce so we stayed all 4 nights and really had a great stay in spite of the fact that there were an extra 600,000 people in Dublin for the Pride celebration, 3 nights of Taylor Swift, a Shania Twain concert and some important sports events.

We had breakfast twice in the on-site restaurant. There is an a la carte menu and tea or coffee is 6euros for a pot. We opted to order the buffet which cost 30euros but included the tea or coffee. The food was very fresh & delicious - I especially loved the scrambled eggs and bacon, but my favorite item was the strawberry/banana smoothie they served. 

The rooms are wonderful - ours had a comfortable king size bed & a large bathroom (no bathtub). We had a view of the street in front of the hotel so we could see what was going on in this very busy area. There was also a chaise lounge in the room. We had plenty of room to spread out. The closet holds a small dresser, electric kettle, coffee maker, iron & ironing board, a safe & a large umbrella. 

We were in the same area as Temple Bar (although we never visited it). There are pubs galore, currency exchanges, banks & souvenir shops. It is a very good area to stay in, we felt. We were able to walk places like to Gaiety Theatre to see Riverdance, too. 

All in all, I think the College Green Hotel in Dublin is a wonderful place to stay and I highly recommend it!

P.S. I highly recommend taking the Jameson Distillery tour. I do not drink whiskey usually but this was such an informative tour & the facility is pretty amazing. Good drinks, too! I'm now a fan of a Jameson, Ginger with lime!",5,2024,07,09

202,Excellent Stay at The College Green,"I am a lifetime Marriott Gold member and over the decades have stayed at many different Marriott and affiliated hotels, including Autograph Collection hotels like The College Green. The College Green in Dublin is easily one of the finest hotels where we have ever stayed. Situated in the most central location in Dublin directly across from Trinity College, it is meticulously clean, and every staff member we interacted with was clearly well-trained, friendly, and a pleasure to deal with. Special thanks to Alan for his help at check-in and arranging to have our lovely room again when we returned after five days touring Ireland.",5,2024,06,26

202,Genuine Luxury in the Heart of Dublin ,"Without a doubt, I have experienced numerous so-called 5-star hotels in Dublin, and I have always been generally impressed. However, my recent visit to the College Green Hotel (formerly The Westin) surpassed all of them. From the flawless check-in with the delightful Jaleema to the exquisite decor and charm of the Heritage Deluxe room, it became evident that College Green is in a class of its own. Despite the hotel being fully occupied, there was an absence of the usual chaos and busyness that I have encountered elsewhere. Both Moorlands Grill for dinner and breakfast were exceptional while indulging in coffee in the stunning Atrium Lounge is an experience not to be missed. I simply cannot wait to return. College Green, take a bow - you're undoubtedly one of the few 5-star hotels to graduate with First-Class honours.
JM, Co Down.",5,2024,06,16
202,Wonderful hotel walkable to much of Dublin,"I stayed for 2 nights in June at the College Green with my wife, 3 children, and parents.  We had an extremely positive experience at this hotel.   The location is wonderful: you can walk so easily to so much of what is in Dublin.  The common spaces are immaculate and tasteful.  The guest rooms were larger than I expected, very clean, and delightfully comfortable.  The wifi was functional and reliable.  The staff were friendly, welcoming, and very helpful.  

We did not patronize the hotel's restaurant or bar, but we did eat their Full Irish breakfast twice.  We enjoyed this very much; there was a wide variety of breakfast foods, the offerings were tasty, and it was more than adequate, even for our teenager.  The hours were very convenient and were extended during the weekend.  

I'm not entirely sure what the value was, as we purchased our stay through a package deal with Costco, but I don't believe it was totally unreasonable.  

If I were pressed to find fault, I would point out that in two places, the main lobby floor is uneven.  One is marked by handrails; the other is not.  My mother tripped on the unmarked incline and aggravated a knee injury.  It's not a major thing, just something to be aware of, especially when carrying luggage. 

We would absolutely stay at the College Green again.",5,2024,06,11
202,Has it all,"This is a beautiful hotel right next to Trinity College and in close proximity to O'Donnell street and the Temple bar area. It was previously the Westin Dublin.  The room we were placed in, the Oscar Wilde suite, was a spacious 2 story room with a large bathroom and sitting room upstairs.  Breakfast in the Morelands Grill, includes a good variety of foods buffet style as well as a la carte items.   The Mint Bar downstairs is open late if you don't want to venture to the pub scene in town.  The live music was amazing.  There is even a small fitness center that has a few cardio equipment pieces as well as dumbells.  If you needed more than that, they offer passes to the gym at Trinity College.  Staff was always friendly and helpful.  Tea service is located in the atrium.   I would definitely stay here again if I ever have the opportunity to return to Dublin.",5,2024,06,11
202,"Great location, beautiful lobby and bar, decent rooms, and an average restaurant.","Great location. Decent clean room. Mediocre restaurant. Nice lobby and bars.

We stayed here recently for a long weekend in Dublin. It was our first visit to the property. Older reviews of this property, when it was the Westin, were less-than-impressive but after reading about the late-2023 renovations and rebranding to Autograph we decided to try it. As Marriott-loyals our first choice was the Shelbourne but it was a busy travel weekend and we just couldn't justify their rates.

The College Green Hotel's location is absolutely fantastic. Walkable to more or less everything in central Dublin, absolutely safe, and easily reachable by bus from the airport and various sight-seeing companies.

The lobby is gorgeous, think nearly Ritz Carlton level. As are the bars. We are Marriott elite and requested an upgrade with SNAs (or whatever they are called now) but did not receive an upgrade so our room was our originally-booked city view King. Plenty big for a European hotel room but it seems the hotel renovations did not extend to the rooms, at least not to this one.  It was fine - clean enough, no bad smells, etc but it certainly wasn't newly renovated which was a bit of a disappointment after our initial impression of the lobby. The room overlooked Westmoreland St - not much of a ""view"" but nice nonetheless. The room was surprisingly quiet considering the busy street below. 

A matter of personal preference of course, but I also found the bed too soft.

Breakfast was included as part of our Marriott elite benefits, as the property doesn't have a lounge, which is nice. This included a la cart menu items (with the exception of two dishes, which called for an additional feed to be paid) as well as a buffet. The buffet was decent. Irish specialties as well as some other Western dishes. Vegetables were unfortunately a bit hard to find, with the exception of a green salad.  I don't know that I'd have breakfast here if paying for it.

The Mint Bar in the basement was fantastic. Live music on both nights we stopped by for a night cap, friendly bartenders, good drinks, and a nice crowd.

Dinner at the Mooreland Grill (the same restaurant where breakfast it served) was OK, not more. Service was somewhat amateur and the food was average. It met our expectations and was perfect of our last night in Dublin since we wanted to ""stay in"" before our early morning travel the following day.  There are SO MANY great restaurants in Dublin - don't skip them eat at the hotel if you have time and energy to get out into the city.

Overall, an OK stay in a fantastic location. We would stay here again if the rates are right compared to competing properties.",4,2024,06,11
202,Restaurant needs better management with staff training!,"Had a nice stay at this property.  The staff were friendly; the accommodations were very nice; the mint Bar and Atrium Bar were lovely. The problem is their main restaurant, the Moreland's Grill.  This is where breakfast is served as well as their dinner eating establishment.  
The biggest general criticism I have is that the restaurant is poorly run.  The person/people responsible for training their serving staff needs a less a lesson in running a restaurant!  From the breakfast through dinner, the servers do not come back to the patrons' table to check on their guests.  Not for a fill up on coffee  to returning to the table to refill glasses of wine from a bottle that we bought that was stored tableside.  We had dinner there one evening and , though the waitress was very friendly and the restaurant was nearly empty of guests, she hardly ever came by the table to check on us.  The entr√© took a very long time to arrive and iwas was just okay in taste.  It was far from busy season, but the staff, I believe, were not trained to do what they were supposed to do...serve their guests properly.  
At the breakfast buffet, items had run out and the staff needed to be informed about this by the guests.  Better management all around was necessary.  Finally, during our dinner, again, with a nearly empty restaurant, new guests were sat a table immediately next to our table, which shows little regard or knowledge of how a restaurant should be run.
I blame the management and not the servers for this poor experience.",3,2024,06,10
202,Definitely recommend!,You will not be disappointed booking this place! Exceptional customer service. Every staff member was helpful and courteous. We had an upgrade to a King suite through our Marriott status.  Beautiful well-appointed rooms. Ideal location for a walking to many popular attractions. Would gladly stay again!,5,2024,06,08
202,50th wedding anniversary,"Absolute best stay ever...the Hotel is amazing...the staff is amazing...everything during our stay was just perfect.

It has been a wonderful experience and we will certainly be back again. Thanks to all the bar staff for making our day so enjoyable.",5,2024,06,01

Well done ladies, the management must be very proud to have such an awesome customer service through you 2. We will be back !",5,2024,06,01
202,"Great location, good room, but small niggly issues that could potentially spoil your trip.","The hotel is a part of the autograph collection and therefore expectations were higher. The hotel is centrally located and very handy to all major attractions, right round the corner of Temple Bar. 
The rooms are comfortable and well finished. 
Hospitality division is amazing and they take full care of you.

Two major issues we faced surprisingly in an autograph collection property - 
1. The bathroom toiletries and amenities provided are at best Courtyard or Four Points level. The soap, shampoo etc are all in pump bottles wall mounted in the bathroom / shower. There is no soap bar or body lotion or any other usual amenities that one would expect in an autograph collection hotel are conspicuously missing. Even simple vanity kit things like ear buds etc are inadequate. No shaving or dental kit either.  
2. The breakfast was also disappointing. The usual spread but with some remarkably strange features. Butter is not out on the brunch table next to breads‚Ä¶you have to ask for it. Nor is cream cheese available next to bagels‚Ä¶again provided if asked for. This is not a major issue - but on a busy morning the staff are busy and you can have your toast getting cold whilst you are waiting for butter to arrive‚Ä¶sadly arriving too late. Very strange little issues - there is no tea spoon or coffee spoon to go with the coffee or tea. We again had to ask for these to stir the sugar - by the time it arrived, coffee had gone cold. There are just so many of these small niggly annoyances that destroys any joy you might want to derive from the experience. Service staff are very kind and helpful, but someone needs to help them with better operations plan.",3,2024,05,31
202,Lovely Hotel in the Heart of Dublin,"Thoroughly enjoyed our two nights at the College Green Hotel in Dublin. The hotel is beautiful both inside and out. The staff is top notch, very knowledgeable and welcoming. The rooms are well appointed with everything you‚Äôd expect from a five star hotel. It‚Äôs located near Trinity College and just across the street from Temple Bat with lots of pubs, shops and restaurants. Reception was amazing and was able to get us into one of our rooms early as we had just arrived from the US. Wonderful hotel and when I return to Dublin I will Dey stay there.",5,2024,05,31
202,"Upscale, Clean Hotel in the Heart of Dublin",Hotel is top-notch! The room was so comfortable and we really enjoyed breakfast. Is within walking distance of Temple Bar. 4 out of 5 stars due to the area having some homeless around (but that is common in Dublin).

202,‚ú®Exceptional Five Star Stay‚òòÔ∏è,"The moment we arrived after a long overnight flight from the U.S. West Coast, we experienced a warm Irish welcome at The College Green Hotel, Dublin‚òòÔ∏è.  At the front door, Stephen in his top hat, graciously assisted us with our luggage and later suggested a marvelous place for an early lunch.  Our beautifully appointed room was ready right afterwards.  During our five night stay we enjoyed an exceptional tea in The Atrium and several delicious meals at the Morelands Grill.  The College Green Hotel was the very best choice for our first time in Dublin.  We will return!  ‚ú® Five Star all the way.",5,2024,05,27
202,Great location! Gorgeous hotel. Amazing experience. 10/10,"This is the most underrated hotel. We had an incredible time exploring Dublin and this was the perfect place to call home while we were there.  We used our ""suite upgrades"" from Marriott to get upgraded to the O'Connell Suite. There was a separate sitting room with minibar, espresso machine, tea set, desk, couch, TV, etc as well as a spacious bathroom with tub + shower. the toiletries smelled great and the extra touches like the dental kit, sleeping mask, etc made it an extra bonus. the maid service was great with AM service as well as turndown service. The Mint Bar had great food and even better drinks and the Atrium tea was a special treat to unwind before heading back on the town.  Late night room service after our concert was also perfection. 

We walked everywhere from the hotel and it's central location made it possible. Temple Bar area, Grafton Street and Trinity College are all right across the street with Dublin Castle, Christ Church, St. Patrick Cathedral, Stephen's Green, Merion Square and Grafton Street a 5-10 minute walk. We also walked to 3Arena to see Dave Matthews and that was a 20 minute walk and easy cycle ride home.  I cannot say enough about how happy we are with this hotel and the location. everyone was so kind and helpful. Would definitely recommend.",5,2024,05,25
202,Ideal location for exploring all Dublin has to offer. Pure comfort.,"From the moment I walked into this iconic building I knew my stay would be amazing. I was warmly greeted by three separate members of the staff before I even got to the check-in desk. I was checked in by a woman who took the time to make me feel that I was the most important guest.
My room was well appointed and the bedding was superb. 
I explored the city on foot and nearly every place I wanted to visit was easily accessible because the location is so central.
The Irish breakfast provided everything you could imagine or want.
But what made my stay so memorable was the sincere kindness and professionalism of the entire staff.
Can't wait to get back to this property.",5,2024,05,15
202,Fantastic Location in Dublin,"This is such a gorgeous hotel in an absolutely fabulous location! Central to everything you could possibly want in Dublin, yet tucked away in a world all its' own.

The guest room exceeded expectations with its luxurious decor and comfortable amenities. Overall, it was an exceptional experience, and I look forward to returning.",5,2024,05,08
202,Excellent hotel in the heart of Dublin,Excellent hotel in the heart of Dublin with professional staff and great restaurant and bar options.  The breakfast buffet (Traditional Irish with great pastries and meat and cheeses) was a great start to each day but the true gem was the coffee served - it was some of the best we've ever had.  The Mint Bar lounge is a most welcoming end to a long day with it's relaxing and spacious atmosphere.  The rooms were all clean and fresh so we were most happy with all the amenities.,5,2024,05,08
202,Fantastic hotel in the middle of Dublin,A wonderful hotel at a great central location. Walk to many attractions and just a few block away from Temple Bar. The staff were amazing and helpful.

We were delight to stay in this hotel where people are really nice and happy to help and advice.",5,2024,05,07
202,Professional and Well Run Hotel,"This hotel knows how to run itself really well. 

Everyone is very friendly and all requests are done expeditiously. Wifi, room comfortability and food are all excellent. 

As a business traveler, very easy to work in room. 

The location is absolutely ideal for doing just about anything in Dublin. 

The only critique I'd make is that the gym is lacking a bit. Other than that, would recommend.",5,2024,05,07
202,Delightful service,"Fantastic Hotel.
Arrived late the stuff were very accommodating, no issues or fuss, quick to book in, quick pit stop in mint bar which had a great feel and ambience to it.
Room was great faced out on main street but could not hear a pin drop so quiet. 
Morning check out hassle free.
Superb experience made by staff would stay again.",5,2024,05,07
202,Beautiful hotel in a great location!,"The hotel is lovely and located near so many of the major sites in the city. Also,  the staff are incredible!  In particular Stephen the doorman,  David the Concierge,  and Yasmin and Jalena at the front desk.  They are so welcoming and friendly and all went out of their way to help with anything we needed!",5,2024,05,04
202,Will Be Back!!,Great location and hotel.  Jay and staff were wonderful in the Mint Bar. The breakfast was also fantastic and the rooms were clean and comfortable.,5,2024,04,30
202,Fantastic breakfast,"Went for breakfast. I thoroughly enjoyed this amazing experience. The staff was very helpful and friendly. Fantastic choices for breakfast. Everything was there, Irish breakfast, continental breakfast, delicious tasty food, it set you up for the day. I will recommend it and will go there again.",5,2024,04,30
202,Thank you David concierge and College Green Hotel Dublin!,"When you walk into a hotel and receive such incredible help from someone like David, you know you are in a special place. David went above and beyond to help me find my lost phone today! He helped other guests, while making calls to locate a driver of the car where I dropped my phone! He cheerfully recovered and returned it to me today!
Everyone at the hotel was so kind. 
I am so very grateful for David and the work he did to reunite me with my phone before we left today!
If you‚Äôre looking for a hotel in Dublin with amazing staff!  This is your place!",5,2024,04,25
202,Our room was uncomfortably hot,"Our room was uncomfortably hot, even with the AC turned on full blast. We had maintenance check the system twice, and they finally suggested bringing in a fan and keeping the curtains shut. Even then, it was difficult to sleep. (A friend who stopped by was shocked: ""This is as cool as it gets??"") Apparently, it's an issue with the rooms overlooking the interior courtyard, but we couldn't change accommodations since the hotel was fully booked. That's a shame, because the staff were lovely and the location is terrific.",2,2024,04,23
202,Great location college  free hotel  in Dublin,Excellent. Nice rooms great location. Wonderful staff front desk. Great friendly helpful concierge.  Would recommend. Think got free daily breakfast with bonvoy. Try it. Nice tea. Nice meeting rooms banking room had great lunch. Definitely would come again.,5,2024,04,22
202,EXQUISITE,"This hotel is simply EXQUISITE. An oasis of  calm in the heart of Dublin City. The view from our bedroom window was the leafy grounds of Trinity College, one could sit all day looking out at the view below. A magnificent mix of old world grandeur and modern luxury. We arrived tired and stressed, after experiencing their signature refreshing tea we were immersed in elegance, opulence & sophistication. This was our second visit, and it just gets better and better. The food was divine and the staff are so friendly and our every need was attended to. Looking forward to returning again hopefully in the near future.",5,2024,04,22
202,Celebrating in Dublin,"A proper, grand hotel in Dublin - it surpassed all expectations. We enjoyed the comforts of a lovely suite! The staff‚Ä¶ nothing short of amazing. It was a five-star experience, to be true‚Ä¶ Dublin is bustling right outside its doors‚Ä¶ Simply walking in created an immediate sense of calm and peace. From an incredible breakfast each morning at Morelands Grill, to evening drinks  at The Mint bar‚Ä¶ it was high class. Loved it!!!",5,2024,04,21
202,Lovey hotel that needs improvements,"Hotel is lovely, beautifully decorated. Great location, close to everything!  The staff were very nice. However, the concierge desk was often unmanned. When we found a concierge and asked for advice for a restaurant, the concierge did not ask what we wanted, offered only one choice, and the choice (which we tried) was mediocre at best.  There wasn't an identifiable phone number for room service so we pressed O. The operator taking orders for room service did not seem fluent in English.  Although the chicken dinner was delicious, the morning coffee was terrible and the late night pizza, although listed as ""thin crust"" was doughy and tasteless.",4,2024,04,21
202,Fantastic upscale bar on the bottom floor of the hotel,"There's a boutique bar on the bottom floor called Mint: sit at the bar and ask for Amin because he will make the best cocktails you've ever had- I'll suggest the Clover Club and then Amin will suggest the Mistress next and they are both phenomenal! 
Feels very comforting in here away from the insanity of Temple Bar area and very high quality in taste and service
This is my new spot in Dublin",5,2024,04,20
202,Dublin Luxury at its finest,"Great everything, location, rooms, service, etc. The espresso martini in the atrium made by Danusia is FANTASTIC!

We also had another fun evening with Amen in the MINT bar downstairs.  The staff at the grill was so kind and accommodated our late arrival with smiles and a great meal.",5,2024,04,15
202,All around great place!,"Great hotel with perfect location. Walkable to almost all of the main attractions. Close to Temple Bar so lots of pub options. The staff were fantastic! Very helpful and cheerful. They went above and beyond. As usual, Marriott beds and bedding made for a very restful sleep.",5,2024,04,13
202,Beautiful and Conveniently Located!,"Fantastic hotel right in the city center! We were only there for two days, so being able to walk to everything was important to us. They upgraded us to an amazing room facing the street, rather than the atrium, which I loved. Breakfast was delicious and service throughout our stay was incredible! We will definitely plan on staying here when we are back in Dublin!",5,2024,04,04
202,College Green Hotel is beautiful & service extraordinary!,"We absolutely loved our stay at the College Green Hotel. The staff is outstanding, Roberto at the front desk is amazing- every hotel should have a Roberto! His attention to detail and level of service really was extraordinary. The entire staff  at Front Desk, Bellmen, The Mint Bartender, Moreland Grill Staff provided exemplary service to me and my family.

I travel extensively , what we experienced here was a rare and wonderful !",5,2024,04,04
202,A Lovely Break in the City,"I stayed at The College Green last weekend with my sister and it was one of the nicest hotel stays I ever had in Dublin. When we arrived we were greeted by Stephen who brought our bags to the desk for us... an absolute gent! The rooms were beautiful, a real luxury. We felt so welcomed by all the staff in all areas of the hotel, the bar and the restaurant; the staff were so kind and accommodating. A notable mention, Fumi from the front desk made sure we were well taken care of and left us a lovely welcome note. 10/10 !!!",5,2024,04,03
202,Disappointing-not 5 Star Quality,"1. Breakfast-delicious scrambled eggs but poor buffet selection for a 5 star. We went down with an hour left for breakfast and there were just a few pieces of dry irish cheddar left with the label ‚Äúselection of irish cheeses‚Äú in front. ‚Ç¨7 Supplement for eggs benedict and other similiar dishes from a separate breakfast menu -why can‚Äôt this be included in the bed and breakfast? No drinking water available at the breakfast buffet which is very unusual. The only type of egg available without an extra charge was scrambled egg. Generally boiled egg, fried egg are also available at breakfast buffets. The breakfast room had a low ceiling and just didn‚Äôt have a great vibe which you would expect for a 5 star
2. Small room-we had the queen sized room. There was one plain wall-could have done with a painting, mirror or piece of furniture eg a dressing table. The carpet seemed worn and the paintings were very plasticy and airport hotel like
3. We availed of the easter deal and staff did not appear to know of signature cocktail deal. It is unedifying having to go through hoops and explain you paid for a promotion when it‚Äôs a treat
4. Free upgrade wasn‚Äôt explained properly when we checked it. When we finally understood after arriving at our room we decided to avail of the free upgrade but were informed it was too late even though 5 minutes had only elapsed since we left the reception desk. It felt like there wasn‚Äôt a five star service

Conclusion: Good location but not up to 5 star quality. We had to ask and ask for things rather than being offered in the first place. Need more staff with people in charge to offer more of a personal touch and a 5 star experience you would expect and are paying a lot for.",2,2024,04,02
202,Amazing Service by Jay,"Jay, the bartender in the Mint lounge was fantastic! He was personally invested in ensuring we had a great experience. Excellent drinks and service. He went above and beyond getting us 2 kinds of bread (sourdough & Irish soda bread with butter) which were not on the menu. He cares about his customers and made our visit very enjoyable. 

Cheers to Jay & to the College Green Hotel. I hope you compensate him for his hospitality and service! 

Sincerely,

John & Jane

202,Perfect,"Ticks all the boxes, and them some.  Great hotel, excellent staff, very comfortable beds.  Rooms are spacious, if you are travelling for work, do remember to request a room with a desk, as (strangely) not all rooms have desking for working.

Location is prefect, ideal location on the Luas Green line.  This hotel is my hotel of choice when in Dublin for business.

I highly recommend.",5,2024,03,25
202,"Central location, attentive staff","Lovely hotel in central location (walking distance to almost everything) with attentive staff all around. Would absolutely stay again, but would ask to be on a different floor (I was on Mezzanine which got a bit of noise from the atrium bar on the same level). Breakfast was a wonderful selection and housekeeping was great - rooms are serviced twice a day, but I was never bothered when in my room working during the day. Hotel was able to get me into a room quite early after flying in from the US which was greatly appreciated. Only thing that I would suggest is working on timeliness of in room dining, communicating how long something will take, and possibly offering a bit of a broader all day menu (including breakfast). The Mint Bar was also lovely and there was a woman who served us (I forget her name, but she was from Turkey) and she was very accommodating and kind! Highly recommend.",5,2024,03,25
202,Mint bar visit,We had stopped by the lovely mint bar for a quick couple of drinks and had the pleasure of being served by the fantastic Jay behind the bar. He just so happened to be preparing some new cocktails when we arrived and we got to have a sneaky taste. Of course that made our visit even more enjoyable.,5,2024,03,24
202,Fantastic Stay!,"Treated Hubbie to a long weekend in Dublin and decided to stay at this hotel as it seemed fairly central but not too central that you‚Äôd get lots of noise interference!

Fab decision the hotel is like a tranquil relaxed affair - fairly busy but seemed quiet and relaxing.

All of the staff we encountered were friendly welcoming and extremely helpful. 

Our room was spacious and clean but was a little chilly at times, however I could wrap up in the robe provided. 

Breakfast was delicious with plenty of choice and the best bit the bacon was separated by cooked and nearly cooked fab! There was also juices, cereals and pastries together with a menu to order extras such as Eggs Benedict.

The hotel was easy to access Temple Bar with a no more than 19 minute walk. Near the college if you want to visit and the Hop On Hop Off buses were about 5 minutes from the hotel. And the Tram line was right outside.

We ate in the Morelands Grill our first evening and food was delicious! Service was slow but it was a nice relaxing eat and we were in no rush!

We also had snacks and drinks in the Atrium and drinks in the Mint Bar both very good üòä

Highly recommended if you like a bit of a treat when you stay away!",5,2024,03,24
202,Overnight in Dublin,Another wonderful stay at this exceptional hotel. Beautiful and comfortable. Nice decorative upgrades since I was there 7 years ago. Staff as always is very welcoming. We enjoyed our time in the Mint bar with our fabulous bartender! The most comfortable room..everything you need on the first night of arrival with jet lag! Thanks to all!,5,2024,03,21
202,A Warm Memorable Welcome to Dublin,"We loved our two night stay at the College Green at the beginning of March.  We experienced a 12 hour flight delay and delayed luggage on our way to Dublin.  Without your caring staff to assist us and provide service to us when we needed it most I am certain our time in Dublin would not have been memorable.  Every staff member at the reception, concierge, and restaurant areas treated us with respect, professionalism and efficiency.  Of particular mention were Colm who gave us quite a detailed listing and discourse on wonderful Dublin activities for our stay.  Additionally, Roberto at reception helped us numerous times with all sorts of room, suitcase, shopping, and rental car information, etc. needs that we had due to our dilemma.  Hope to see you again!",5,2024,03,19
202,Amazing suggestions,"I stayed at the College Green Hotel last week for an informal business meeting, where I was assisted by Luis at the concierge desk. He kindly parked our car and recommended that the best area for our work discussion would be the Library Room in the Atrium Lounge, and he was absolutely right! His friendliness captivated me and my colleagues. After that, he also advised us on an incredible restaurant, Rosa Madre (the lobster pasta was delicious) and a pub called Stag's Head for a beer to unwind after a stressful day of work.",5,2024,03,19
202,Sleeping in a sauna,"This is the second time I‚Äôve stayed here and I will never recommend nor stay here again. After being placed in an interior room (this stay) the temperature control is broken and no one cares that the room temperature is 28. If you enjoy sleeping at this temperature perhaps this place is for you. However, no staff member seems to care and it was a miserable stay because of this issue.",1,2024,03,18
202,Fun St Patrick‚Äôs Day!,What a wonderful st Patrick‚Äôs weekend! My family and I were greeted so warmly and happily by Fumi and Roberto. We were able to get checked in early which was great so we can rest up as we had an overnight flight. We were just very lucky with the room being ready! They were both so fabulous and recommended us great restaurants! We were so happy with our stay and we hope to come back next time!,5,2024,03,17

202,R&R treat for Mothers day,"Just back from a fabulous stay at the College Green Hotel , everything about the hotel is 5 ‚≠êÔ∏è the staff are so welcoming & informative the location couldn‚Äôt be better so central to everything. The Beds & pillows are amazing ! Best night sleep I had I a long time. Breakfast is also excellent & caters for all needs. Highly recommend this hotel it really is a treat.",5,2024,03,11
202,Exceptional service always at The College Green Hotel,"Myself and my husband have been coming to the College Green Hotel for many years. It  is both a night away destination (as we live in Dublin) and also a go to for a night cap on a night out in the city centre. The first time we discovered the bar in the hotel we met Jay the bar manager who literally made our visit exceptional. His customer service, professionalism and knowledge behind the bar is second to none. He is without a doubt the main reason we return time and again. I can literally 9rder anything....many times I discover a new cocktail off menu and nothing is a problem. Every drink is delivered with care and a he makes it an experience which is great appreciated. On our most recent visit we also met Amin who is equally as professional and also has a lovely manner with customers. He is testament to the amazing customer service we have been lucky to become accustimed to and I look forward to my next visit.",5,2024,03,09
202,Bloody good !,"R√≥is√≠n was brilliant and catered to all our needs. Excellent recommendations and fast service. Food was great, we had a sharing steak and it was cooked to perfection üëåüèª

Not too expensive for the quality and amount you get, great wine selection too!",5,2024,03,08
202,5* event,"We held an event for our client in the Banking Hall at the end of February. The team at College Green Hotel were fantastic from start to finish. Emunah Metoudi and Sarah Glennon prepared a proposal that met all our event requirements and they assisted us in every step of our event planning which meant a smooth build up in the organisation of the event, through to the onsite delivery. The team onsite on the night were also 5* and therefore we would highly recommend The College Green Hotel to anyone considering a high end event in Dublin city centre.",5,2024,03,07
202,Amazing value and experience in ideal location,"I loved my stay. The rooms were impeccable - stylish, spacious, clean and comfortable. The staff was more than friendly and also funny. The concierge and the receptionists gave excellent recommendations where to go / what to do for entertainment, food, drinks. etc. The cleaning staff was polite and very conscientious. The MINT bar was great fun, as they had an artist playing classic rock songs on the Piano (Elton John, Dire Straits, Guns'n'Roses etc) and the choice of Irish Whiskeys was great. 
In addition, the location is ideal - you can take the Dublin Express bus to pretty much right in front of the hotel from the airport, and you can reach the business districts (Sandyford & co) with the Luas (Tram) which is also right there. You walk out of the hotel, and you stumble onto Fleet Street, and Grafton Street is close. Right next to Trinity College. It doesn't get more central than that. 
Honestly have nothing bad to say - next time I'm in Dublin I'll stay here again for sure!",5,2024,03,05
202,Best Hotel in Dublin,"We loved this hotel! The location was perfect and staff welcoming. Because our first room was very warm, Roberto at the front desk arranged to have us moved to another more comfortable room. His attentiveness was remarkable. The concierge was extremely helpful giving directions and recommending restaurants as was the doorman. If we were to visit Dublin again, I would definitely book this hotel.",5,2024,03,03
202,Felt like a queen!,The nicest weekend break I have had in a long time. We were made feel so special from the minute we walked in the doors to the moment we left. The FOH Mngr was so kind and all the staff were so pleasant. Room was Devine and the bed was so comfy. Will definitely be going back,5,2024,03,03
202,Brilliant - highly recommend,"Brilliant hotel. I highly recommend it. The hotel itself is gorgeous. The staff are very professional and friendly. We arrived very late (10pm) and ordered burgers via room service, and I have to say that was the best burger I've ever eaten. 

The bed was very comfortable and the shower had full pressure - towels were huge & the shower amenities were top quality. 

You get free access to the Trinity College gym, a 10 min walk away, which has all the equipment you could ask for; and the breakfast at the hotel was top notch - brilliant selection of breads, continental cheeses and meats, full Irish breaky and yoghurts and fruits. Best yet was they brought over an entire jug of coffee so we didn't have to keep asking for more.",5,2024,03,02
202,Beautiful hotel in Dublin City centre ,"The College Green Hotel is a plush hotel in Dublin City centre, with very comfortable rooms, delicious food and very gracious staff. The hotel is very spacious, with a bar, restaurant and decorative Atrium Lounge. My favourite Dublin hotel!",5,2024,02,29

The real treasure however is the team and the lengths that they go to so as to make for an extra special experience! We simply can't wait to return. Nigel",5,2024,02,27
202,"Great hotel, great location. Thank you to Kenji","I‚Äôll typically stay here if I have a day in Dublin. The location is great, right in the middle of town. It‚Äôs about a ‚Ç¨30 cab ride for those early morning flights to the U.S.  I had a room facing Westmoreland street and while I was informed that it could be noisy (especially on a rugby weekend) I did not have any issues with noise.  

The superstar for my trip was Kenji. Kenji helped with checking out at 5:30 AM, made sure there was a coffee for me and got me a cab. He made getting to the airport really simple. 

A great hotel.",5,2024,02,25
202,Great weekend stay for the rugby,"I‚Äôve stayed here for years as the Westin Dublin but since the name change the have upgraded the reception area and the rooms on the mezzanine floor where I stayed 
Great staff from Steven the doorman through reception restaurant and Mint bar
Had a great stay for the Wales v Ireland game
We will be back",5,2024,02,25
202,What a cocktail!,Bar tenders in the Mint Bar are excellent mixologists.   Watch theme create incredible drinks.  Pick a drink not on the menu and will whip it up.  The Mint Bar was formerly a vault in a bank.  You can sense the ambience of the old bank.  superb service and food  in the Morelands grill.,5,2024,02,22
202,A quiet piece of luxury at the heart of Dublin,"This hotel delivers a level of comfort and luxury in a modern setting that I did not realise existed in Dublin. Staff are incredibly attentive and picked up on all our needs and looked after us brilliantly without ever being intrusive. The Atrium was incredible, we simply didn't want to leave.
We also had drinks and great music down stairs in mint bar when we had escaped Temple Bar. The room was spotless and so comfortable, again you could tell that there is an attention to detail engrained in all staff members which makes for a fantastic experience
The breakfast was super too and again, nothing was too much trouble for any staff.
We will certainly be back having discovered something very special",5,2024,02,20
202,A wonderful stay in Dublin city centre!,"The hotel is beautiful outside and inside, and the staff is very attentive and friendly adding the bonus that many of them speak Spanish. The room was quite spacious with a very luxurious bathroom with shower and bathtub. In the room you'll find a tray with the ""Signature Tea Experience"", a informative tea book, two cups and two bags of a very delicious tea so you can prepare your afternoon tea. 

The included breakfast buffet is really good, in addition to being able to try the famous Irish breakfast, you can complete it with waffles with real maple syrup or honey extracted directly from the honeycomb, a wide variety of fruits, cereals and pastries and really delicious coffee. 

I want to thank Kenji the receptionist who took care of us in the evening, he greeted us with a smile and wished us a wonderful experience, he was very attentive to us our entire stay and attended us in spanish. 

I stayed from Saturday to Monday and I can say that it was one of the best experiences I've had in hotels in Europe. ",5,2024,02,19
202,Excellent Hotel - Pure Luxury,"Great night in a fabulous hotel.  Pure luxury, it was so clean, comfortable and the staff were so nice.  The room was decorated to a very high spec and the toiletries were great.  Couldn't recommend this hotel enough and can't wait to go again.

202,Centrally Located Dublin Hotel with Excellent Customer Service,"This was my first time in Dublin and this hotel helped to make it a great visit. I landed in Dublin at 5am and was exhausted so I went to the hotel early and they managed to let me check in early (before 6am!) so that I could get some sleep before exploring the city. 

My room rate included afternoon tea so they contacted me prior to arrival to arrange it and all of the teas and food were flavorful. The hotel concierge recommended the Bank to me for dinner and the sweet potato Wellington was incredible. 

Morning breakfast is a la carte or buffet so I chose a la carte and was impressed by the quality of the waffles and omelette. Overall this was a great experience (and as you can see my room was a unique amazing spot) so I hope to return again soon.",5,2024,02,11
202,Soaked in Dublin at the College Green,"Just all around wonderful, esp. for the first time in Dublin. Convenient location to the history and the pubs we wanted to explore, luxurious accommodations (smallish rooms but to be expected for a city hotel), amazing breakfasts, and incredibly friendly staff... from the front desk to the concierge and the wait staff. The underground bar (The Mint) was our last stop every night. So cozy and bartenders that made us feel at home. Especially Oguzhan. We looked forward to seeing him evert night!",5,2024,02,05
202,Always a pleasure,"We have stayed here a few times and ours stay is always amazing. This is mainly down to Jelena and Stephen. Jelena always makes our stay special and looks after us. Sometimes in hotels as good as The College Green people don't like to see young children. This is definitely not the case here. Jelena is so friendly and helpful.
Likewise Stephen always has a smile at the front door and takes the time to ask how we are and has a little chat with our son. He has a brilliant knowledge of the city and wouldn't steer you in the wrong direction. 
We always look forward to our stay in the College Green and will be back soon.",5,2024,02,05
202,Good location,The College Green Hotel is nicely situated but not the best customer service. I did receive my suite award upgrade and had a nice sitting area but the walls are quite high with small windows that cannot be looked out of. There would have been a nice view being close to Temple Bar. The room was quite dark because of this. The restaurant was ok but service not the greatest. Location is good to get to pubs. The bar was great but this would not be my first choice upon returning to Dublin.,3,2024,02,04
202,Fantastic stay,We really enjoyed our stay. The facility is in the perfect location and close to everything. The hotel is well maintained and beautiful. Staff was very friendly and helpful.

202,Perfect place to enjoy a pint,Mint bar is the secret of Dublin if you want to get away from the crowds and enjoy a true authentic Irish experience then look no further.  The bartenders and managers are top class.  Drinks are perfectly made and the live music is very entertaining and not too loud.   Definitely will return and definitely recommend.,5,2024,01,20
202,Wonderful and relaxing stay,"I stayed during my Christmas holidays and the hotel is so beautiful. It was beautifully decorated and every time I walked back to the hotel I was always in awe!

I would also like to give a special shout-out to the front desk as they were extremely welcoming, and friendly. The concierge were always providing great recommendations around the area when things were open.",5,2024,01,20
202,Wonderful night at The College Green Hotel,"We had the opportunity to stay the night at The College Green Hotel to celebrate our wedding night.

The staff were excellent starting from concierge welcoming us with a smile and a quick and smooth check-in. 

The room that we had was The College Suite  and it was just fabulous üòç The bedroom is very well designed, with a walk in wardrobe.

The overall experience was fabulous.
A big thank you to Vera , Nicole and the entire College Green Team who made us feel so welcome for our night stay!",5,2024,01,19
202,Overnight stay,"We had our wedding at The Westin in July 2022  before it was renamed The College Green Hotel. Due to the arrival of our baby we had to postpone our anniversary overnight stay until January 2024. As we live in Germany finding a time was tight, but our date was given to us with no trouble. 

The staff could not have been friendlier . On top of the fantastic dinner (where my Spanish husband could speak his mother tongue with the friendly waitress) and delicious breakfast we had our best nights sleep since the baby came! 

The room itself was perfect, with a comfortable bed and beautiful decor. Luxurious doesn‚Äôt cover it. 

I forgot something and it was no trouble for it to be posted to my home address. We were treated like royalty from start to finish. I couldn‚Äôt recommend this hotel more, sincere thanks to all at The College Green Hotel",5,2024,01,17
202,Excellent place to stay,"Excellent property in every way. Location is superb for someone focused on the heart of Dublin. Impecably kept up. Staff in every department was outstanding: concierge, restaurant, front desk and housekeeping. Beds and pillows VERY comfortable. Breakfast options at restaurant very good.  No business/executive lounge. Worth every penny.  ",5,2024,01,16
202,Wonderful Hotel and Staff,My wife and I went tho the College Green for our anniversary and had a wonderful time. The entire hotel was well kept and seemed to be recently updated. The staff were exceptional and treated us very well. As a Platinum elite our room was upgraded. Great experience and would highly recommend staying here to anyone visiting Dublin.,5,2024,01,14
202,Credit to their staff,"Stayed at the college green hotel this weekend for a quick night away in the city centre. Absolutely stunning hotel, but the real credit is to their staff.

202,Trip to Ireland,"Perfectly located in the best part of Dublin. Historic and outstanding accommodations. A short walk to all of Dublin‚Äôs best attractions, bars and restaurants.  The staff was friendly and accommodating. We will definitely state again on our next visit.",5,2024,01,06
202,Loved the hospitality ,"Excellent staff, rooms and food. Nothing was too much to ask from room service and concierge was super friendly. We stayed in the Westmoreland street and it was like your private Lil home off temple bar with a small Christmas corner. ",5,2024,01,06
202,Excellent Property with Exceptional Staff,"Beautiful and elegant property perfectly located within walking distance of all the major sites. The staff is fantastic. If you get a chance, go to The Mint bar downstairs and have Jay concoct you a libation. Not only was he a skilled and knowledgeable cocktail craftsman, he was a warm and genuinely pleasant fellow and a consummate professional. ",5,2024,01,04
202,High Tea,"We had an amazing high tea experience with our waitress, Danuta. The Christmas decor was a nice touch and we were able to sit & just enjoy the beautiful ambience for hours. Definitely don‚Äôt miss out on this if you‚Äôre in Dublin! ",5,2023,12,31

202,Wonderful long weekend trip,"Great experience at this property. The staff was incredibly polished through every interaction. 
Food Service:
Incredible food service with the included breakfast for elites. This property definitely does not skimp on the breakfast benefit, and I super appreciate them for that effort when so many properties make half-hearted efforts to comply with Bonvoy program rules. 

Room:
Our suite had a distinct full bathroom; sitting area with TV, coffee table, minibar, large window, & desk; bedroom with TV, large window with balcony access; side room with closet & tea/coffee service. 

Balcony: 
Two chairs, but we had to stand up on the ledge to actually appreciate the views of central Dublin

Locale: 
Immediately across the street from nightlife and dining so that it was easily accessible without any bothersome noise. 

Notable Points:
Traveled to Dublin for a 3 day, 2 night trip from the States. 
Stayed as a Bonvoy Titanium Elite and was upgraded to a reasonably large suite.",5,2023,12,27
202,Best Christmas Eve and Christmas Day celebration‚Ä¶,"What an awesome time at the Autograph College Green Hotel.    The Christmas Eve and Christmas Day package was amazing and we thoroughly enjoyed the mulled wine and mince pie in the Lounge, Morelands Grill for Christmas Eve dinner and breakfast, the ballroom for Christmas Day buffet (outstanding food) and the Mint Bar for a nightcap.    5 star service by all!",5,2023,12,26
202,"Outstanding service, drinks and atmosphere.","This hotel - OMG the cocktails!! Literally the best Lemon Drop I have ever had in my LIFE!!

202,Shouldn't be a 5 Star it should be a 10!!!!,"I have stayed in The College Green Hotel twice in the last month for two birthday trips, I just simply love it there! The concierge that welcome you, taking your bags and assisting with directions are top class. Stephen on the door added that extra touch to our visit, a well learned man who is extremely witty and jolly. The front desk team were extremely kind and attentive, making sure our birthday trips were most enjoyable. A big thank you to Alan the Front of House Manager and Fumi who made us feel so welcome for our birthdays, really made it special! The Mint Bar is a great place for a few drinks and casual food, Jay was exceptional. Of course, the location and the decorations are amazing but their real credit is their staff! ",5,2023,12,15

Highlight was spending a few hours in the Atrium in the afternoon ... super relaxing and food was outstanding.",5,2023,12,05
202,Excellent stay...highly recommend!,Staff are great!  Everyone was friendly and helpful.  Excellent location in Dublin City Center and steps away from shopping and Trinity College.  Breakfast was really good and worth fueling up for a day of touring.  The Mint Bar is a hidden gem of the hotel.  It's cozy with inviting staff plus it had music one of the nights that we stayed which made for a cool vibe.  Highly recommend this hotel for all!,5,2023,12,03
202,And all this is for 540 euros per night?!,"We spent 5 nights at the hotel because we were attending a congress.
Every morning we woke up from a loud noise coming from the floor above - there was clearly renovation going on.
Cleaning the room was limited to just straightening the bed linen and changing the towel. 
It was curious that for all five days they simply did not vacuum a carpet in the room - we noticed that the threads and dust on the floor remained untouched for all 5 days (although several times we asked to clean the room again).
A surprising mismatching how hotel looks from outside and room cleaning from inside!
And all this is for 540 euros per night?!",2,2023,12,03
202,afternoon tea,"Three-course event ‚Äì a sandwich course, scones course, and patisserie course.
And a perfectly chilled glass of Champagne usually makes the cakes taste even better. And perfectly service of Nataliia at Afternoon tea! Most recommended!",5,2023,11,30

202,Exceptional Service!,"We cannot explain how well we were treated and accommodated while staying at the College Green! I put my back out on the day we traveled to Dublin. We received exceptional service from the desk clerks to the concierge, David, as everyone went above and beyond to make me comfortable and for us to enjoy our stay. I highly recommend the College Green to everyone wanting first class hotel service! :)",5,2023,11,23
202,City Break,"Nice warm welcome from Roberto, who explained some of the recent developments in the hotels re-brand. 
The Room was spacious, and the bathroom was spectacular with premium amenities.

202,Festive tea.,"Went for afternoon tea last Saturday for Christmas time as they had their new festive afternoon tea. 
It was lovely from the begging to the end. 
We were a group of three we were placed in the library area it would have been nice to be in the main part but the table was still lovely. We were served by a lady called Cary‚Äôs and she was so attentive from the moment we sat till when we left she knew what she was doing and was so professional and was very attentive without being too intrusive. Other lady‚Äôs served us also. 
We celebrated my friends birthday and they brought out a fab plate with some candles.
I highlighted reccomend coming here.

202,"Spontaneous visit, left feeling welcomed and warmed ","What a pretty place!! Upon recommendation I visited the Atrium lobby/cafe after work on a weekday evening and was met by a cheery and hospitable Natalia who sat me down in a cozy and warm lounge area. This was my first time visiting the hotel, and not being a true drinker, both Natalia and Carys were more than helpful in taking the time to explain the different gin and tonic combinations on offer, making recommendations - helping me to feel at ease and very comfortable visiting for the first time. This quiet area was such a cozy place to relax alone or with others.. With attentive, friendly but respectful staff who enjoy sincere connection and chats. Will definitely be back with company again soon! ",5,2023,11,21
202,Outstanding experience!,"Outstanding hotel. Best place we've stayed in decades. Super staff. Exquisite meals as well as high tea. Awesome sheets and pillows. Very clean room. Twice daily maid service. Concierge team was very helpful. Location is exactly where you want to be in Dublin. Safe area and walking distance to everything. If you don't feel like walking, the taxis wait on the side street. The concierge team helped up book a private tour guide/driver for site seeing. We will be back.",5,2023,11,12
202,BEWARE. Avoid at all cost.,"READ. BEWARE. We stayed at the College Green for 2 night at the beginning of November 2023 and pre-purchased our room using Costco Travel. The morning of night #1 we were rudely awaken near 9am by hotel staff attempting to force their way into our room and scarring the heck out of us. After yelling they took off, I complained to the desk and there was NO follow up with me. Upon checking out the desk tried to charge me for my drinks from the bar that I paid for using my CC the night before. After checking my CC account online I found that they charged ‚Ç¨214.98 to my card for charges that were not approved by myself as I pre-paid for my stay. I emailed the reservations team about the issue and they won‚Äôt respond. I‚Äôm now forced to report this hotel to Ireland authorities and to Costco Travel due to fraudulent activities.",1,2023,11,10
202,Everything we wanted from a wedding venue,"We got married at the College Green Hotel in October 2023 and we would absolutely recommend it as a venue. We were kept in touch with everything needed (we live in London). The venue is spectacular - we saw a bunch of Dublin hotels and the Banking Hall here is comfortably the most impressive, the service impeccable and the food very decent. Above all we appreciated the attention to detail: one old and frail relative was taken special care of, cakes, photographer, DJ all seamlessly accomodated. At all times we knew what was coming when, and who to speak to if we needed anything seen to. The best thing I can say about the College Green is that they took all the stress out of the experience. Unconditionally recommended.",5,2023,11,06
202,Amazing breakfast,"We went for breakfast. The staff was friendly, professional and attentive. The choice for breakfast was excellent, everything you could think of was there. Very tasty full Irish breakfast with top quality breads. Excellent smoke salmon. Amazing selection of cheeses. Delicious smoothie. Great variety of sweet breakfast. It was a very special experience. I will definitely come back and recommend it.",5,2023,11,05
202,CIArb dinner,Well equipped classic but modern hotel well situated in central Dublin. Not far from the airport. Quite rooms with air conditioning. Good bar and good breakfast. Fantastic banquet hall in the Old Banking Hall with splendid ceiling and chandeliers.,5,2023,11,04
202,Great hotel in the best location.,"Amazing hotel. Everything was top notch. Rooms, staff and amenities were great. The central location makes it very easy to get around Dublin. The restaurant and the bar were great for breakfast and a relaxing drink at the end of the day. A high end hotel that will make you glad you stayed there.",5,2023,11,01
202,The College Green Hotel Hotel would be a ‚Äúluxury‚Äù Marriott property in the USA. ,"Why is it that European Marriott ‚Äúpremium‚Äù hotels are so much nicer than those in the US?

 I had the pleasure of spending three nights at the College Green Hotel (formerly the Westin Dublin).  It is a beautiful facility with high-end furnishings. The room was large and comfortable. The location is fantastic. I never had to take public transportation or a taxi except when going to and from the airport. Everything is walkable from the hotel‚Äôs location. As I have experienced during prior trips to Europe, Westins (and clearly Autograph Collection Hotels) in Europe are a significant notch above Westin hotels in the USA.  Overall, this hotel was nicer than most Ritz Carlton hotels where I stayed in the USA or the Caribbean. I had breakfast every morning in the hotel restaurant and the food and service were excellent. I would not hesitate to stay here again and I recommend it 100%. ",5,2023,11,01
202,Great hotel in the heart of Dublin.,Beautiful quaint hotel in the heart of Dublin! The staff was very welcoming and sincere. The location was incredible (Temple Bar starts right across the street) The breakfast was excellent and a great way to start the day. The room was unbelievable with all the amenities you can imagine! ,5,2023,10,23
202,Ciara & James Wedding 15th July 2023,"Choosing the College Green Hotel as the venue for our wedding reception was a decision we couldn't be happier about. From the very beginning to the end, the team at the hotel demonstrated exceptional dedication and professionalism. We would like to extend our heartfelt gratitude to the remarkable individuals who made our day extraordinary, with special recognition to Ziarra, Owee, Eilish, and, in particular, Kelly.
From the moment we met Kelly, it was evident that we were in capable hands. Her meticulous attention to detail is truly unparalleled, and her calm, organised demeanour is a testament to her professionalism. Kelly consistently displayed unfailing courtesy and good humour, addressing each request with a positive outlook, which is a valuable asset, especially during the rigors of wedding planning.
In one instance, we had organised a dinner for the bridal and groom parties the night before the wedding but had to change the venue at the last moment. Kelly swiftly assisted us, securing reservations at Morelands Bistro, which turned out to be a memorable experience.
On the day of the wedding, Kelly's presence was felt throughout the event. She graciously welcomed and ensured the comfort of our guests, while also meticulously overseeing the flawless execution of every detail. She took the time to check in with us and our families to ensure our satisfaction with the bar service and every aspect of the day. The Banqueting hall, elegantly set up, was simply perfect, including the table for the cake and family photographs. The floral decorations and table settings were exquisite. The quality of food and wine exceeded our expectations, and the service was impeccable.
In summary, our wedding day at the College Green Hotel was made truly unforgettable by Kelly and her dedicated team. Their commitment to excellence and their meticulous attention to detail elevated every aspect of our celebration, leaving us with beautiful memories that we will cherish forever.",5,2023,10,22
202,Lovely Hotel with Great Staff,"This place was recently rebranded (was Westin Dublin) and it is absolutely lovely. The staff was great and the room was really nice and plush. It is also very centrally located so you cannot go wrong. I wish I could have stayed longer. The only thing I didn't like is that I was promised 4p checkout as a Bonvoy Gold member and that wasn't noted. When I asked, I was given 3p. Other than that, I enjoyed my visit. I will be back!",5,2023,10,21
202,Close to everything.  ,Nice clean hotel with a friendly staff.  The hotel is centrally located.  Temple bar area is an easy walk and so is Trinity College  Mint bar was a relaxing spot for a drink.  I would recommend The Westin if you plan to visit Dublin. ,4,2023,10,11
202,Great venue. Slightly dodgy room and infrastructure. ,"The venue is beautiful. The Mint Bar is fantastic. Amin is an amazing bartender. 

The location is exceptional. 

The rooms on the fourth floor are a bit weird with a four step staircase from the door to the sleeping area and low ceilings in the bathroom and the sleeping space. 

There is almost no natural light in the 4th floor rooms with a tiny dormer window and a skylight with a shade that doesn‚Äôt open or close using the controls on the wall. 

The 110 v and 220 v outlets in the bathroom did not work even after we asked for them to be repaired. 

The 240 v outlets rejected our adapters. 

The USB outlets did not charge our iPads. 

There are no USB - C outlets. 

My overall assessment is that this was probably an exceptional hotel 5 years ago but that it has not kept up to date with modern requirements. ",4,2023,10,08
202,Wonderful stay!,"Outstanding in every aspect!!  Our suite, which we were so fortunate to be upgraded to due to our Marriott status is absolutely stunning.  Service is at your fingertips by the gracious, accommodating staff.
Location wonderful - would highly recommend",5,2023,10,03
202,Mad price for what we got,"We are used to Dublin hotel prices being pretty high and that‚Äôs bearable if everything is up to scratch. That, sadly, wasn‚Äôt our experience here for two nights at ‚Ç¨656 per night with breakfast included. We had what was described as a ‚ÄòDeluxe king room.‚Äô  Yes, it was comfortable but it was inward facing into the hotel atrium which is roofed-over. Natural daylight was very limited, therefore. The room was compact and the bathroom small. The air-conditioning, even at the lowest temperature setting, seemed to be struggling and, with no external windows, the overriding sense was of airlessness - quite claustrophobic.  Shortly after arrival I went to reception to query if indeed we had been assigned a deluxe room. We were assured we had, but it didn‚Äôt feel like it.  For a deluxe room at ‚Ç¨656 a night it‚Äôs reasonable to expect everything to be just right. But it wasn‚Äôt. There was no hand soap at the sink in our bathroom on arrival - basic. By day two the toiletries were not refreshed. Also, for ‚Ç¨656 ‚Äòwith breakfast included‚Äô an additional charge for some dishes at breakfast seems excessive. The breakfast was ample but limited in some ways (no muesli, we were told, when we asked).  The Luas tram passes immediately outside the main hotel entrance. This means that a taxi cannot stop there. Designated stopping is around the corner. There was no one to assist us there with our luggage as a result - not great for 5* and at that price. The overriding feel of this well-kept and lovely building is of no light or outdoor aspect.  Even the bar is windowless and in the basement. All in all we felt this hotel was over-priced and fell short. Far from the best Westin we have stayed in around the world.",3,2023,10,01
202,Luxury Close to it All,"Well appointed, centrally located hotel with plenty of amenities and a lovely bar with fireplace to enjoy a later evening drink. The beds were comfortable and the bathroom large, with the shower truly enjoyable. The bath products are from their spa collection and are truly wonderful. We enjoyed our stay very much.

202,We had afternoon tea for my daughter getting married  with family...It was a most beautiful afternoon..,The food was just delicious and so much of it..My daughter has a nut allergy and all was so well taken care of...Would definitely go again...What a great team....The Teas were amazing...The champagne was amazing..thank you all,5,2023,09,24
202,Best drinks at the Mint Bar with Amin the Master Mixologist ,"I enjoyed a beautiful cocktail lunch with my husband at the Mint Bar in the Westin. We had the most amazing cocktails thanks to Amin, the Mint Bar‚Äôs Master Mixologist. Amin‚Äôs attention to detail, carefully poured and stunning presentation made it a moment we will never forget. Do not miss The Mint Bar and look for Amin to hand craft your cocktail experience. ",5,2023,09,24
202,Perfect Start to Holiday!,We just arrived at the Westin for the start of our holiday‚Ä¶beautiful hotel.  The best way to get acclimated to Dublin is to spend a couple hours at their Mint Bar!  Bartenders Amin and Oguzhan are wonderful to visit with and make the best craft cocktails!  I am looking forward to visiting this bar every night if our stay!,5,2023,09,22
202,Nice stay in the heart of Dublin. ,"Great comfy beds and very convenient location. Directly in front of Fleet Street and the start of Temple Bar area. The hotel is a quick walk to just about anywhere in town. 

Our afternoon highlight was the Atrium bar located in the mezzanine for afternoon tea and drinks. If you get the chance, let Arlind surprise you with a delicious cocktail. The man is a wonderful storyteller and a skilled mixologist. 

The staff were all very friendly and attentive. Definitely a great stay. ",5,2023,09,22
202,A bit disappointed considering this is designated 5*.,"Stayed 3 nights. Very nice room and buffet breakfast with good service.  However, they never cleaned our room, and when leaving were told at reception that we had to make a request for cleaning the room. We were in a group and others said they had the same problem.  Is this something new? Has cleaning rooms in Westin hotels been cancelled.  
Judith",3,2023,09,22
202,Amazing bar service,"My family and I went to Dublin for a vacation. We stayed at the Westin for 3 nights and we were so happy! The best part though was the bar service. Oguzhan, Amin and Luke were very attentive and made great drinks for my mom and I. My sister and her husband also had a great experience with the staff at the bar after coming home from their anniversary dinner. We would highly recommend their service. Make sure you ask Ogu to make you a special chocolate martini, he makes the best ones!",5,2023,09,21
202,Best hotel in dublin,"Excellent location extremely helpful staff thank you REIGN from reception you are amazing, the rooms M03 where extremely comfortable clean and so beautiful view is  lovely, I was impressed with the excellent customer service provided, all the staff where friendly and helpful highly recommended this hotel, and I will certainly be returning again.

202,"Great Location, Great Experience","We visited Dublin for 2 night and chose The Westin Dublin.  Great Experience!  Our double room was spacious, bathroom well appointed.  Breakfast was outstanding.  Very leisurely with wonderful service.  We found ourselves in the heart of everything Dublin.  Would absolutely stay there again.",5,2023,09,18
202,5* Service for Afternoon Tea,"Went for afternoon tea with my partner to celebrate a recent promotion. From the moment we arrived to the minute we left, we were treated like royalty. I‚Äôve been to afternoon tea in several 5* hotels in Europe and the US and this service and food were certainly 5*. We were looked after by Katty, who was extremely genuine and pleasant throughout our time. She was very knowledgeable and polite, anytime we needed assistance she was straight over. I would be more than happy to return (which I will be doing soon) based on the overall experience. The food was delicious, the setting was magnificent and the service was 5*. Definitely returning!! ",5,2023,09,18
202,Highly recommended,"I had a wonderful experience in the Restaurant of the Westin Hotel, our server, Katty was lovely! The service was excellent, and I found it to be the perfect place for scones in the mornings. The cozy atmosphere and delicious scones made for a delightful start to my day. I highly recommend it!",5,2023,09,18
202,Excellent property and perfectly located!,"We stayed at the Westin in Dublin and absolutely loved our stay!  The staff were warm and welcoming, our room was amazing (we got an upgrade to the 2 floor Yeats suite) and the property couldn‚Äôt have been in a better location to see the sights for the day and a half we were in Dublin!  Thank you to the Westin Dublin staff for making us feel so welcome!",5,2023,09,17
202,Great night,Spent a night in the Westin for my anniversary had a great Saturday night in the mint bar. Amin our barman was great fun and made amazing cocktails if you spemd a night in the mint bar you need to ask Amin for a Saturn. ,5,2023,09,16

202,"Amin & The Mistress, Not to Be Missed","I am staying at the Weston Dublin and the Mint Bar is in the Basement. I have been coming every night and here are 3 reasons why:

1. Amin, the first bartender to take care of me, and every one after, have been fantastic. Great energy, good temperament, has a servant‚Äôs heart and wants every guest to have a great experience. 

2. The drink he recommended, The Mistress, is now probably my favorite since I have begun traveling. It is female-friendly and consistently prepared. The presentation is also beautiful.

3. They go the extra mile. I needed a pen and paper, Amin gave it to me, no questions. Paulino in the Mooreland Grill upstairs brought me better wine than was being given complimentary, on the sly, and even the lounge and the concierge are helpful beyond the ordinary.

Don‚Äôt miss out on the Westin Dublin, Paulino at the Mooreland Grill and Amin at the Mint Bar, as he was my

The room, which was upgraded, included a balcony that had sweeping views of the city.  The hotel‚Äôs, Mint Bar, was a good place that provided a respite from the noise and bustle of the city‚Äôs streets and restaurants scenes.

202,Lovely dinner,"We had a lovely meal in The Moreland Grill in the Westin. Pleasantly surprised as many times we have eaten in restaurants in other hotels and more often than not it is disappointing, this was not the case in The Westin. The food was very tasty and the service was wonderful , we were very well looked after. Small things make a difference such as how the staff greeted us in the restaurant, when we were asked did we enjoy our meal , was there anything we needed etc all of these things were asked of us ,very professional but also personalable with a lovely atmosphere. 
Many restaurants and hotels are serving food that is below par and service that is lacking which absolutely infuriates me especially as they charge very highly but again we found the opposite to be the case in The Moreland Grill.

Our driver, Anthony picked us up from the airport and provided information about what we were passing along the way as well as what one could do and see in Dublin. The Westin is in walking distance of countless and various areas of interest including Trinity College and Temple Bar, but since it was pouring rain during most of our stay we used Uber to get around to museums, Guinness and Jameson. The concierge kindly offered umbrellas when we were walking. There were six of us traveling: my husband and I, our son and daughter-in-law and our 2 teenage granddaughters. Our rooms were lovely and more than comfortable.  We stayed in a Deluxe Room, with a king bed and our family stayed in a Deluxe Double Double. We especially appreciated the posh bathrobes. There were 3 restaurants at the Westin. The first is The Morelands Lounge and Grill where we enjoyed breakfasts. The hostess was pleasant and there was never a wait to seat our party of 6. The buffet was extensive and ordering from the menu was also an option. We particularly enjoyed the scones, fresh fruit, yogurt, lattes and cappuccinos. The second is The Atrium Lounge is a five-story high glass atrium.  It was beautiful and relaxing with amazing natural light and a pianist. It. A great place for tea and cocktails. The third is where we spent time in the evenings. The Mint Bar, a former bank with interesting architecture and live music. The heavy rain made staying in preferable to visiting local pubs. Oguzhan was our server one night and bartender the next. He was very personable, pleasant and accommodating. Ganze and Carmen also helped us and were very attentive. It wasn‚Äôt busy on our first night that there but the next night it was packed.  An international group was meeting there. The service was still excellent, the music was great and we had a wonderful time.  We very much enjoyed our stay at the Westin and the time we spent in Dublin.",5,2023,07,19
202,Great  hotel  - Recommended,"Very nice hotel and staff. I would recommend the hotel and I would stay there again.  

Special shootout to Amin the bartender at the hotel's bar. He was great and went above and beyond to make us feel welcome. Thanks Amin.",5,2023,07,17
202,Great location and great hotel!,"The Westin was a great place to stay! It's located in the heart of it all, with many attractions within walking distance and near public transit if you're not a walker.  Lots of restaurants and pubs nearby as well.  We walked to Acapulco for fajitas for dinner and The Hairy Lemon for evening drinks and fun.  The staff was friendly and the rooms are quiet and nicely appointed.  The restaurant had a nice breakfast to fuel up for the day ahead.  Would definitely stay again!",5,2023,07,17
202,Fantastic Hotel with an excellent Team,"I have recently been to Dublin for business purposes and have stayed in ""The Westin Hotel"" for the first time. Luckily my usual hotels were booked up that I had to put my head around for another one. 
I have loved to stay there and I really appreciated the service from all employess I have seen.
The design is another plus and the hotel looks like having so much character & style.
Also the location is fantastic and you can walk to literally almost everything.

Can¬¥t wait to come back again.

202,Great place to stay in Dublin,"We were booked at the Westin as part of a tour group. We arrived at 6am after an overnight flight.  We were pleasantly surprised when the front desk clerk said there was a room available for us!  The room was very nice - clean, quiet, comfortable bed and nice size bathroom.
The location was great - just down the street from Trinity College, across street from Temple Bar area, near the Liffey river and very walkable to many things in Dublin.
The doormen/ concierge people were very helpful- directions, restaurant suggestions and securing cabs.
Ate breakfast in hotel restaurant 3 mornings. The buffet was very good with a wide selection. Had a group dinner at a private room at hotel. The dinner was very good as well.
I would definitely stay at this hotel again!",5,2023,07,16
202,Amazing Experience and close to everything,"This property was in the center of it all. Walking distance from tours, hop on hop off buses and even the rail. We walked miles around to see different sites and bars and it was just a quick hop, skip and a jump away. The hotel view was fabulous as I was able to see Trinity College and the moving city from my balcony. The breakfast was great, the people were amazing and helpful, the service was awesome, and the rooms were spacious, and the beds were so comfortable. I will be back for sure as we had a fabulous time touring.",5,2023,07,16

Staff are well trained and super helpful. Special call out to the concierge / valet team - especially Stephen. It‚Äôs a skill to remember the names of returning patrons.

Afternoon team - to be enjoyed.

Deserves its 5 stars.",5,2023,07,13
202,The nicest staff ever!!,"I recently stayed in The Westin, Dublin with my sister, my sons, niece and nephew.
I cannot compliment the staff in this hotel enough. They literally could not do enough for us and went out of their way to accommodate us in any way which would make our stay better. Special mention to Nicole and Chloe at reception who were exceptionally lovely to us.
Nothing appeared to be any trouble for all staff members we had the pleasure of meeting and for this alone we would not hesitate returning to this hotel. 
What a wonderful advertisement for staying in hotels in Ireland. 
Thank you to all staff members for making our overnight stay in such a warm and welcoming hotel so wonderful.",5,2023,07,11

202,Best restaurant,"It‚Äôs been a few weeks now, but I still remember and must recall the wonderful experience I had in the Westin hotel, Westmoreland street on Father‚Äôs Day. My daughter took me there for dinner and not only was it nice to be in such pleasant surroundings with my daughter but an atmosphere created by the staff was so welcoming and warm. One girl named Chloe, was so attentive, pleasantly chatty and considerate that before I even ate, I was glad we decided to try the restaurant there. The meal was excellent with everything cooked to perfection and served hot, as I like it, and with no delay. The all experience was delightful and I would definitely go again when I get a chance.

The staff is friendly, professional and smiling, the place is spotless. Our room had a beautiful view and was really spacious. 
The breakfast is amazing, tasty and well cooked. there is a big variety of food. We had dinner there and the service was impeccable, not to mention the great food.

202,Wedding at the Westin,"We are so glad we chose to have our wedding at the Westin. We were initially drawn to the city centre location but the charm of the Banking Hall and the professionalism of the staff were what sealed the deal for us. Eilish was a wonderful coordinator and was so easy to work with. She ensured our special day got off without a hitch and went above and beyond for us. The reception was perfect and was personalised to our tastes. The Banking Hall was beautiful and our guests were very impressed by the food, service and attention to detail. We are so grateful to everyone that played a part in making our day so special and we will cherish the memories forever. We look forward to many future visits to the Westin and to reliving such an amazing day! Thank you! Aimee & Shane",5,2023,06,30
202,Amazing High Tea at the Atrium Lounge,"We came to high tea at the Atrium Lounge, and it was an amazing experience! The atmosphere is quite elegant, and the tea sandwiches are lovely! The top of the platter was filled with amazing desserts, and it‚Äôs hard to even get to them after the sandwiches and scones. 

The service was exemplary, but an extra shout out to Ricardo for being so generous and helpful. He‚Äôs got the right calm and kind demeanor for tea, you know? Just lovely.",5,2023,06,27
202,"Luxurious, peaceful hotel in the heart of Dublin City","The Westin Dublin is a genuinely peaceful haven in the middle of Dublin City. The rooms are plush and extremely comfortable, the food and drink are delicious and the staff are so attentive. Once you close the windows, the room is genuinely silent, providing a peaceful escape while still having the convenience of the city on your doorstep. The hotel is very spacious, with lots of room to relax including the restaurant, bar and the decorative Atrium lounge. I highly recommend it!
",5,2023,06,23
202,Cocktail made by Jay was excellent,"Very friendly and helpful staff and the prices were great, a lot of good quality Irish whiskey and some really good US and UK imports as well. Jay served me a wonderful Old fashion . He is really nice guy , Music was great . Wish that singer continued a bit longer . Overall really happy of this place .",5,2023,06,16

The room was spacious and ample amenities for both of us! The bed were very comfortable and we had a balcony overlooking the spire!we will definitely stay again! Highly recommended ,5,2023,06,14
202,Excellence location!,"The Westin in Dublin was our first stop on our Tauck tour or Ireland. It was a nice property but nothing really stands out to me either good or bad. To me, the best asset for this property was the location. It‚Äôs perfectly situated for the average tourist.",4,2023,06,13
202,Fantastic hotel ,"Had a wonderful stay in The Westin in April with my husband. The hotel is beautiful and the attention to detail is next to none. The food was fantastic in the restaurant. The staff are very helpful and friendly,  especially the general manager Joanne. She went above and beyond to make our stay special, we couldn't thank her enough! Highly recommend this wonderful hotel and we wish them all the best with their rebrand.",5,2023,06,13
202,"Excellent hotel, in a great location and a fabulous front manager, Alan !","Due to the most hideous experience at The Fleet hotel ( do not stay here ) across the road, my family and I had to very quickly find an alternative hotel for a weekend visit to Dublin. We crossed the road to the Westin Hotel and all our prayers were answered, mainly down to the wonderful Alan Brophy on the front desk. We would like to pass on our huge thanks to him and his team for looking after us so well. 
The rooms are great, beds very comfortable, concierge very helpful and  the Mint bar is super for a post dinner drink. 
The only slight issue I have to mention, which was nothing to do with Alan, is that breakfast was a bit of a fiasco the next morning with a long wait and under staffed. However Sunday breakfast was much improved. 
But it wouldn‚Äôt put me off staying again in the future.  
",5,2023,06,12
202,Excellent Afternoon Tea,"My aunt treated my daughter and I to afternoon tea last Thursday and it was a wonderful experience. A richly flavoured selection of savoury and sweet items beautifully presented, along with an extensive selection of teas. Our marvelous server Bart explained everything with clarity and wit and added a lovely bit of entertainment to the experience. He also took excellent photos for us. Would highly recommend.",5,2023,06,12
202,Great experience,Beautiful hotel. Wonderful staff that is accommodating and warm.  The hotel location is fantastic and allows you to walk to most destinations. Couldn‚Äôt be happier with my stay at the Westin Dublin. Would highly recommend ,5,2023,06,12
202,Great stay at the Westin!,"The entire hotel staff from the concierge team, the front desk, and cleaning staff were all so friendly and helpful. The room was extremely clean and comfortable. The location of the hotel was right in the center of Dublin and made our traveling very efficient. It was nice to be able to take a break and relax in our hotel room in between activities during the day. Even though the hotel rooms are on the pricier side, it was worth every penny. Would highly recommend!",5,2023,06,12
202,An average hotel in Dublin,"I was expecting more from this 5 start hotel in Dublin, although main comun areas are nice, rooms are outdated, towels were really old, we ask for new ones but they brought same old ones. Room service is very limited and poor. We left the no disturb sign, however when we came back for a jacket the cleaning staff was there. Only positive point, its location in Dublin.",3,2023,06,06
202,"Dirty Rooms, untrained staff, poor customer experience.","We checked in on June 5th at the Westin in Dublin. I am a Gold member with hotels.com but when I asked about room upgrade I was told none available and I could not check in early either. Finally checked into our junior suite after not receiving the promised call that the room was available. My husband and I were tired after traveling and wanted to go to bed. My husband took his shower, I took a bath and got into bed. I immediately noticed that the sheet was dirty. I called the on duty manager Nicole and she came up. While in the room we also noticed that the towels provided to us were also dirty with red stains. My husband realized that he had showered and used a dirty towel and had been using a dirty robe.  We expressed our frustration and concern as both my husband and I are immune compromised. We were moved to ‚Äúan upgraded suite‚Äù. The problem is our junior suite had a bigger tub and shower that we could both use. The upgrade room was no longer facing the library which is the view I specifically picked and on all city streets. We were also offered dinner. The one dish I wanted when we got to dinner was sold out. The rest of the meal with the exception of the clam and salad was mediocre. My husband steak came well done. So we are in a room that we do not like and did not need had the room we booked been clean. We were offered points which is less than the amount of a typical room we book. Overall, it seems what we are being told is that, we have offered you enough and you should be grateful. No consideration that psychologically we have been using dirty towels and bedding with a strangers body fluids. We asked for them to simply compensate for our stay. This is not how we wanted to end a 3 week vacation. I DO NOT recommend the Westin in Dublin. While I believe that Nicole was trying her boss Yazmin did not reach out to us and was unavailable when we returned from our excursion.",1,2023,06,06
202,The best afternoon tea experience!,"I recently went for Afternoon Tea in the Westin Hotel with friends and what an amazing experience we had. We got such a warm welcome from the moment we walked through the door, to being sat at our table in the Atrium Lounge which was beautifully set up and luckily right beside the piano player who was fantastic. Evelina explained how the tea would work and couldn‚Äôt be anymore helpful if she tried. Pavel also looked after us very well. We went for a cocktail in The Mint Bar after which is definitely a hidden gem! The General Manager Joanne is in safe hands with all her staff and is a credit to the hotel. Would highly recommend for the perfect girly day out! ",5,2023,06,05
202,Westin Dublin Experience,"The Westin Dublin . Excellent location within walking distance of  central Dublin attractions including Temple Bar. Large rooms  with great views. Mariana at the front desk, Jeremy in reservations and Sandor ‚Äúconcierge‚Äù went above and beyond to accommodate our requests in this lovely hotel. They made our stay in Dublin perfect. Sandor booked our private tours with Alan . Alan is a wealth of information including its culture and history. He is a very safe driver with the patience of a saint not to mention a great sense of humor . This was our first trip to this beautiful country of Ireland rich in its history and culture where the people here truly know how to enjoy life  ",5,2023,06,05

202,Afternoon Tea Amazing!!!,"Had the wonderful opportunity to avail of Afternoon Tea at The Atrium Lounge.  In what was a reunion with work colleagues/friends after a few years. We had an absolutely amazing memory made, this was totally down to the professionalism, class, friendliness and amazing selection of food and beverages being served.  Faultless attention to detail from the welcome to the hotel, piano playing, and service . I could not recommend highly enough. ",5,2023,06,04
202,Great hospitality and the best cocktails ever.,"The accommodations were great, the entire staff was friendly and helpful. We stayed for three nights, a wonderful buffet breakfast was included with many different options from their menu. Our group of four would like to give a special shout out to Amed the bartender.  Over our stay he made some of the best cocktails with his own small variations on the classics. All four of us agreed they were the best we ever had. Stop in and experience some of the best drinks ever. ",5,2023,05,25
202,A Great Experience ,"We had a girls weekend away, from the time we arrived to the hotel until our departure we were so well looked after. The staff were very friendly and efficient, they really made our stay a memorable one. Breakfast is an experience with an excellent choice of continental and cooked breakfast. I would highly recommend a stay if in Dublin.",5,2023,05,22
202,Location is great,"The best thing about the Westin is its location, right in the heart of the city. We were able to walk everywhere we wanted to go.

As for the room, it was adequate but on the small side, as was the bathroom. There were sufficient plugs for electronic equipment. Staff was friendly (although the concierge, who made a restaurant reservation for us, gave us bad directions to it). There was no desk in the room, but there was a small table that was an acceptable substitute. Breakfast was good.

Overall four stars is just about dead on for a rating here.",4,2023,05,21
202,Will definitely go back,"Great location. Staff (especially concierge team and reception), friendly and efficient. Comfy beds, good size rooms. Interesting historic building. Relaxed atmosphere.All the things you would expect from a 5 star hotel.",5,2023,05,21
202,"Bit of a letdown, given the cost","Cramped room under the eaves with a skylight which meant the room was bright at 5am.
Being a city centre hotel you have to put up with late night party people returning at 3am. Check in was a hassle. Breakfast was good.",3,2023,05,19
202,Clean and Modern hotel in the heart of Dublin,"We enjoyed our stay here!  We booked two rooms 1 with 2 double for our teenaged children and another king for my spouse and myself.  The best thing about this hotel is that it is in the heart of the city.  Within walking distance of many attractions and sites.  It is right next door to Trinity College so the vibe is very young and felt a lot like the US.  
The service was good as we the first room we had was a handicapped accessible room which was fine but the shower was level with the rest of the bathroom causing a wet floor everywhere which I didn't care for.  So they allowed me to change the room.   Downside is that there is only one side of the hotel which has a decent view.  My kids' room had a wonderful view of the street where as both the rooms we had faced the internal courtyard.  It can be awkward watching people eating at the indoor cafe from your room. if you mind that sort of thing try to request a street view.  We didn't have the option when we booked our package through Costco.

You can book tours easily from the vendor which is just a few yards away the trolly stop is just outside the hotel so you can transit very easily without taking ubers or taxis.  

Everyone one was very chill and friendly.  We went during Easter so it was a very special time.",5,2023,05,18
202,5* luxury," luxurious stay got a beautiful upgrade on check in staff were excellent very attentive staff from check In and to check out. Highly recommendable location perfect middle of everything good for shopping ",5,2023,05,15
202,Inadequate bedside lighting; good location,"My husband and I stayed here 4 nights. I rate this hotel a 4 due to the inadequate bedside lighting. Our room had no individualized bedside light controls. If one person wanted to lie in bed and read, the bedside lamp of the partner would also be on, which would be disruptive to the partner‚Äôs sleep. Even mediocre American hotels/motels have individualized bedside light controls. Also, there was no way to adjust the direction of the bedside light. It was more like a muted wall sconce. The poor bedside lighting is the primary reason I rate the hotel a 4. Perhaps the hotel believes that everyone should be reading a backlit iPad instead of a paper book. 

Our room was fairly small and did  not have enough space for two upholstered chairs. Instead we had one upholstered chair and a fairly comfortable chaise lounge. The table was a fairly low oval 2‚Äô x 4‚Äô. The bedside nightstands were small but had a shelf and a drawer. The window sills were wide enough to offer storage, as was the shelf under the TV. The closet had some shelves, but the room was not big enough to house a dresser. My husband usually likes to unpack his suitcase, but that wasn‚Äôt practical in this hotel. 

Our particular room had an odd bathroom floor plan. There was no hook to hang your bath towel close to the shower. You had to walk across the tile floor dripping water to reach a towel. The terrycloth mat just outside the shower blocked the movement of the bathroom door. It is entirely possible  that other rooms in the hotel had a better floor plan. There was a large deep shelf over the toilet for storage of guest toiletries and medications. 

I was happy the hotel room had glass glasses and pottery coffee cups. There was a fridge stocked with beverages. I believe there was a small hot water heater for tea plus a coffee maker. All of this was nice. 

The hotel has a great location near Grafton street shopping. Temple Bar is nearby for those who want to drink and dine with fellow tourists. 

The hotel‚Äôs Atrium Room on the mezzanine is a nice place to have high tea from 12-5 or a drink in the evening. There is a gas fireplace. My husband and I had drinks there twice. We never made it to the hotel bar in the basement. 

The included breakfast was very good. I particularly liked the eggs Benedict. 

Our room faced a side street that was quiet for sleeping.

All the employees in the hotel were helpful. 

When we return to Dublin in a couple weeks we will stay at a hotel with individualized bedside lighting, two upholstered chairs, and a bigger table. We stayed at that hotel a year ago.",4,2023,05,15
202,A great stay!,"My husband and I for to stay at the Westin for the New Year celebration 2022/2023 and we had such an amazing time! From the moment we walked in, we were in awe with the structure of the hotel and how friendly the staff was. A 5 -star treatment!
I can't forget to mention the outstanding Chloe Houston, who received us with the biggest smile on her face and made sure we were happy and satisfied with our stay.
The room is of great size and the bed is so big and comfortable!
Would definitely stay again and recommend this hotel!",5,2023,05,15
202,"10/10 at the Westin in Dublin, Ireland","My 3 night stay at the Westin in Dublin was lovely!  Wonderful service from the moment I entered the beautiful reception area.  A very friendly, professional and courteous welcome!  
The room was beautiful ‚Ä¶ very spacious, incredibly comfortable and spotless. 
Had an amazing breakfast at Morelands Grill right on site. Great selection on offer for breakfast so it was hard to choose but my Eggs Benedict did not disappoint. It was delicious!!
I ventured to the Mint bar in the evening, also on site, and had the most perfect Espresso Martini to finish off the day. Delish!
I had a wonderful time in Dublin and would highly recommend the Westin Dublin if you are planning a stay in that beautiful city. ",5,2023,05,15
202,The best hotel in Dublin ‚Äîno kidding,"From the minute we walked into the main entrance, we were treated like family. Stephen, the concierge was outstanding and making recommendations, and the room was absolutely exquisite. The bed was extremely comfortable, the pillows were perfect, and, although we could look out into the street, it was absolutely soundproof inside the room. Could not ask for more.  And the location was five stars. We had friends stay nearby at another hotel, and they were sorely disappointed. We were not. Would recommend highly.",5,2023,05,13
202,"Great Location, Great Experience","The Westin Dubin, located in the heart of the city near Trinity College, was a great place to stay for two night before beginning our small ship cruise up the coast of Ireland and over to Scottish islands.

After an overnight flight from the US, the reception staff was able to prepare our preferred room after only a short wait. Everyone we met were helpful and at the Westin enthusiastic. 

Our room was large and quiet, looking out on a courtyard. Our bed was of Marriott quality with good darkening of windows at night. The large bathroom included a soaking tub and shower. Our only wish was that the shower was a bit larger.

Highly recommended!",5,2023,05,05
202,Absolute Gem of a Hotel,"The Westin Dublin is an absolute gem.  The service and employees are the best of any hotel I have seen.  Courteous, helpful and always with a genuine smile on their face.  The hotel is clean, spacious and of course the beds are heavenly.  I slept like I was in heaven and didn't want to get out of the bed.  Housekeeping did an excellent job with cleaning.  The afternoon tea was lovely and staff wonderful as well.  The pianist that played during tea was very nice.  The breakfast buffet was very good. The concierge team was very helpful, pleasant and one of the best teams I have encountered in my travels.  If I return to Dublin I will stay at the Westin.  I also spent a few nights at the Shelbourne which I will do a separate review on.  The Westin wins hands down over the Shelbourne.",5,2023,05,01
202,Great location,"This was the last hotel of our family Ireland trip and it was a positive send-off before heading home.  Rooms are spacious and updated and the hotel offers everything you need with very friendly and responsive staff.  We had three rooms for our group which included a one-year old.

The location is perfect if you want to be walking distance from most things Dublin has to offer. One block from Trinity College, a very short walk to Grafton Street and all of the stores and restaurants (that had excellent variety). Many of the historical spots or sights of interest were within a mile and it's an easy city to walk.

Breakfast provided lots of options and there is an atrium bar along with the Mint bar in the lower level if you want to grab a cocktail in the evening.  All of the Concierge, Bellman and Front Desk staff were exceptional and couldn't be nicer.  

There were some minor issues, most notably that  the room was not cleaned thoroughly each night.  In addition, there was confusion about our reservations and the deposits taken and the crib was in the  wrong room. The Front Desk took care of everything immediately, but you would expect a Westin to get this right the first time. It might be the post-COVID effects, but the restaurant and bar help was inexperienced and we had to wait or track servers down just to get coffee or a drink.  We noticed that this was something that Ireland in general is dealing with (like many other countries).",4,2023,04,29
202,Afternoon Tea in Westin,"I visited Dublin to spend a few days with my second family, and some friends recommended me to pass by Westin to enjoy their famous Spring Afternoon Tea. We booked in advance as it was a highly demanded experience at this place, and I'm not surprised.
The experience was wonderful: delicious treats served on precious porcelain, accompanied by top-class champagne in an atmosphere truly relaxing. The Atrium is a lounge of light.
About the appearance of Westin in general, there is little I can add beyond what is already obvious: a simply divine little corner in front of Trinity College, which exudes glamor and elegance.
Those members of the team who attended us were authentic hospitality professionals.
Absolutely recommended, Westin is an experience in itself.",5,2023,04,24
202,Excellent afternoon Tea ,"We had afternoon tea in the Westin Hotel and it was exceptional from start to finish!

202,Best hotel bar,"The hotel is beautiful and the staff very kind and friendly however the best part of the stay is the experience at the Mint bar. Jay and his staff are so much fun!

202,A series of disappointing events,"I usually don‚Äôt write reviews (or complain about an experience), but after sending this note to the hotel the night before our check out and being told a manager would respond within 48 hours ‚Ä¶and‚Ä¶ it being a week+ later with no response - I am just posting the note I sent to the Westin Dublin (via the Mobil app) below:

‚Äî‚Äî-

Hi - I hope you are well. I am writing to you to mention the disappointments my spouse and I have had during our stay at The Westin. I normally don‚Äôt call out these things, but the issues (both in occurrence and frequency) described below are subpar for a 5 star accommodation like the Westin. While the items below have generally been resolved, and each of these things are excusable and understandable on their own, the pattern of issues is what has been so frustrating. Examples include: 

1) Loud and vibrating construction (as if they were tearing up the floor above us) noises that lasted for ~1 hour straight once we checked-in this past Monday. Once we called the desk about the noise after getting to our room, we were told ‚Äòemergency maintenance‚Äô was occurring with an estimated completion time of 3
to 4 hours, although we were told the noise would likely end in 5-10minutes(?). We understand this stuff happens and if items are time sensitive they have to happen no matter what. However, we would have appreciated a notification that loud maintenance would be according before we entered our room for the first time, especially as this was directly following our red-eye flight where we were hoping to grab a quick nap after check-in. We appreciate the Macarons we received as an apology for the noise.

2) Bill issue - we were billed for a ~50euro lunch at the hotel atrium that we didn‚Äôt not have. In fact, we were on the other side of the city at on a tour during the ‚Äòcharge‚Äô. After inquiring we were told it was a mistake and the charge was removed. I don‚Äôt feel confident this would have been caught if I hadn‚Äôt proactively looked.

3) Room service provided wrong food (tomato and cheese instead of Irish Ham/Cheese on Rosemary) late at night. We requested the room service via the Marriott app, so miscommunication between myself and the hotel was not the issue. This was frustrating since we were both exhausted after a long day of exploring and did not want to wait another 1/2 hour+ for new food to be made (as such we declined the option to have the correct food made). The charge for this was removed, but the events were annoying nonetheless.

4) The shower was clogged the whole week. After the first few nights we decided we‚Äôd had enough and reached out to the front desk (via the app) asking for this to be fixed the next day. We were told someone would stop by to fix the issue. The next night, we returned to the room at 11:30pm with our shower dismantled with screws and parts sitting in the shower making it inoperable. We had to call the front desk to come and do a repair when we were really looking forward to just going to bed. The next morning we received another call from the front desk asking if maintenance could come up to fix the issue and that they were waiting for us to take our privacy sign off (they had no idea maintenance attempts had already taken place) - apparently there had been no communication that the previous days/nights events had occurred. (Note the flooding issue was never fully resolved)

As stated before, all of these items on their own could be explained away as either accidents or ‚Äò1-offs‚Äô, but in totality we have been underwhelmed and disappointed during our visit. With all that, I do want to say that all the staff we have interacted with have been courteous, professional, and kind. In particular our interactions with housekeeping have been fantastic.",2,2023,04,09
202,Surprisingly Average,"This was our 6th visit to Dublin; and for this visit our primary purpose was to enjoy our daughter's final performance with the Trinity College Orchestra. Other family members were joining, so we chose a central place where everyone could gather. 

The location is outstanding, of course. Our room was comfortable and the bed linens ample. It is a shame, though,  that one had to ask for fresh towels, and for the room to be serviced, at a 5-star hotel. The breakfast over our four days never changed, either; even a different flavored water would have been appreciated. 

The WiFi worked without problem. The in-room television viewing options were quite limited to world news and British gardening shows. Within the bathroom there was no place but the shower floor to place personal toiletries; and our particular room lacked an absorbent mat outside of the shower, so we had to use a towel. 

The Mint Bar made for a fun gathering space, though the volume of the music could certainly have been lowered a bit so that conversations could be overheard. Outside of breakfast in the Moreland Grill room, we did not otherwise partake of the menu. 

Would we stay there again? No. ",3,2023,04,06
202,Bliss,"Lovely stay at the Westin hotel in Dublin  (as always), gorgeous decor, tasty cocktails, delicious food, lovely staff‚Ä¶ cannot recommend enough.

Also would recommend the afternoon tea, brilliant experience.",5,2023,04,05
202,A perfect location,"Fantastic hotel in a great location.  Concierge are a great team, very friendly and extremely helpful. Room comfortable but difficult to regulate the temperature so it was warmer than we would have liked. Our safe did not work but was fixed the same day we reported.
Food in The Mint was lovely and only criticism in the restaurant was breakfast. Would prefer a la carte and not buffet for fried food so compensated with pancakes and waffles which were very tasty",5,2023,04,02
202,Outstanding experience,"My husband and I stayed there for four nights in March. While we thought the hotel itself was amazing, the staff was what made our experience so special. The front desk went out of their way to help us (I wish I could remember their names), the concierge was so helpful, and we went to Mint bar several times. Lauren, who served us in the Mint bar, was outstanding. She was helpful, prompt, and after our first visit remembered exactly what we drank and that my husband loved the peanuts - so she brought us two without asking. We thought our whole experience was amazing and will stay there again next time we come!",5,2023,03,29
202,"Within walking distance of ""must sees""","Lovely hotel within walking distance of Art 
Galleries, Grafton St, Trinity College.
Bart in the Atrium Lounge served me exactly what I ordered, which is a rare experience
Lovely wallpaper throughout
The bathrooom facilities are spotless and beautifully decorated
",5,2023,03,24
202,Afternoon Tea in the Atrium,"My sister and I booked Afternoon Tea in the Atrium for Mother's Day as a treat for our Mam and Nan.

We all absolutely loved our experience, and it really was an experience. The Atrium is beautiful, absolutely stunning decor and the full glass ceiling lets in so much light - it's the perfect spot for a girly Afternoon Tea. 

From the moment we arrived we were greeted by lovely staff who couldn't be more accommodating and friendly. Our server, Bart, was amazing - he was so attentive and genuinely friendly. 

The food was gorgeous, we thoroughly enjoyed every single part, and there was so much too! The free glasses of Champagne for the Mothers was a lovely touch and so appreciated, and the unlimited tea went down a treat too. 

It is expensive, but it's to be expected with a 5-Star hotel and honestly the experience was something I would definitely recommend to everyone. A fabulous treat for the special ladies in our lives! ",5,2023,03,23
202,Brilliant breakfast,"I had breakfast at Moreland today and I am pleasantly surprised.

It was a nice welcome and a good and also personal description of the variety from your supervisor ( Silvia ) of what they offer at their breakfast, from buffet to dishes on their menu card.

The food and drink was excellent and quickly delivered to me.",4,2023,03,23
202,Very pleasant experience ,"The service in the Afternoon Tea Area was amazing.
The staff went above and beyond from meeting me to when I left.
Although it was busy the entire time I was there, Evelina was very attentive and friendly the whole time! 
I would definitely return there and recommend it to my friends and family! ",5,2023,03,22
202,Great stay for business with our company,"The hotel and amenities were great. I really enjoyed how friendly the staff was, in particular Sylwia & Pablo! The food was excellent (real honeycomb), and they made sure we had everything we needed! ",5,2023,03,16
202,The best hotel staff I‚Äôve ever experienced.,"Not only was the hotel, one of the classiest I‚Äôve ever been to in my life, it was also the friendliest hotel staff I have ever experienced. I would like to give a shout out to Sylwia, Pavel, Paloma, Stella, Ladi, Yumi, Pablo, D, Malcolm, Mariana, Steven and countless others who I couldn‚Äôt meet for making my time in Ireland so much more elevated than it already was. You all are loved and missed by Jordan and myself (: - Carsen",5,2023,03,14
202,This is a great central luxury hotel for your stay in Dublin,This is a great central luxury hotel for your stay in Dublin. It has been recently renovated and the rooms are large and elegant. The service was personal and friendly. Both the main restaurant and the Atrium are a delight. ,5,2023,03,09
202,10 out 10 Experience,"Overall a great experience, Andrea at the front desk was more than welcoming and offered us great advice on activities to do around Dublin. The welcome we received on Friday evening was 10/10 and started our weekend off on a high. To top the weekend away we had a lovely card hand written by the Hotel manager Joanne with a bottle of bubbly and treats. We stayed in the William Butler Yeats suite and it was outstanding. The bar staff in the Mint also went out of their way to make our experience a 10/10 and the cocktails defiantly lived up to their online reviews. The room was outstanding and well stocked with everything we needed and more. Slyvia was more than helpful at the breakfast buffet on Saturday morning and ensured we had everything we needed. Our overall experience of the Westin was 10 out 10, we would 110% recommend the Westin to a friend and will be returning in the future.",5,2023,03,07
202,Feed back about services ,"The hospitality at this Bar is top-notch, 
The staff Suraj and jay are always friendly, professional, and eager to assist us with anything we needed. The complimentary of snacks is served I can't say enough about the exceptional hospitality we experienced at this Bar.Best place to spend time.",5,2023,03,04
202,Engagement celebration,"I recently got engaged and was looking for a place in the city to celebrate during the weekend. Decided to treat ourselves with a small getaway at the Westin and it was worth it!! The hotel might be a bit pricey but you get what you are paying for, the staff was friendly from the begging to end and the reception team was delightful. Marianna was kind enough to send us a card and a small present to the room for the celebration. The only feedback that I would add is about the Tv in the room, which unfortunately did not have Netflix only open channels. 

Overall would recommend if you are looking for a bit of luxury in Dublin city.",5,2023,02,25
202,Great Central location,The hotel had everything I needed for my short trip to Dublin with my sister. We were exhausted from our flight and Reign at the reception tried his best to accommodate us as soon as possible. Everything was walking distance and Sal gave us a great recommendation for dinner at The Bank. Would recommend the place for anyone who prioritizes a friendly service above all!,5,2023,02,25
202,Perfect,"From the moment we arrived everything was just perfect at the Westin. Staff are so friendly and welcoming, they are a real credit to the hotel. Our rooms were so spacious and comfortable, we enjoyed some drinks in the Atrium before heading out to a show, this is such a beautiful space. We have enjoyed afternoon tea here on previous visits and I couldn't recommend that enough. When we returned from the theatre we had a drink in the Mint Bar and the staff were amazing. Breakfast both mornings was out of this world, the items on the buffet were actually hot. My son, who is a very fussy eater loved the pancakes. Again, the staff were so friendly and attentive. This is a return visit to the Westin for us and we will be looking forward to returning again.",5,2023,02,24
202,Overall happy but found the half-bottle mouth wash unpleasant,"Service: very friendly reception. In-room dining was quite ok and reasonably priced. 
Room: decent size with a work desk which is quite handy for business travelers.
Location: good and convenient.

Something unpleasant: just checked in but saw a half-bottle mouthwash.",4,2023,02,20
202,"Nice place, couple of niggles...","This is a pretty smart and well-run hotel (as it should be, for the price). Couple of niggles. First: there was no proper desk where I could work in my room... aside from a tiny round corner table which forced me to hunch over a laptop and develop a bad back. There's also no business centre so the best place I could find was a library room thingy in the atrium. Secondly, breakfast buffet is rather good until you get to the cooked section where they serve extremely poor (greying, watery) scrambled eggs (no fried unless I am missing something) which I can only assume come out of a packet, plus mass-market tasting sausages which rather let the side down...",4,2023,02,16
202,Excellent January visit to Dublin,"The Westin Dublin is in a great location, on the edge of the Temple Bar area so you have the benefits without the drawbacks of the bar, music, nightclub scene in Dublin. The hotel itself has multiple lovely sitting and dining areas. We especially liked Westmorelands for breakfast (and dinner) and the Atrium for afternoon tea or just sitting around and plotting our next adventure. The staff are friendly and efficient, at the entrance, front desk and restaurants. The room was on the mezzanine level and we were initially worried about street noise, but it turned out to not be a problem. It turns out the Irish rarely use their car horns! We we would definitely recommend.",5,2023,02,11
202,Unbeatable choice in Dublin,"My second trip to Dublin was made even better in every way by choosing the Westin. It‚Äôs location is unbeatable and the staff always rose above expectations whenever I had questions. Lastly, this place is clean: immaculate even. This guest was very impressed! ",5,2023,02,09
202,Afternoon tea,"Myself and my good friend went to the Westin for afternoon tea and the service was very good and the staff were very helpful and friendly.The Afternoon Tea selection was very tasty and presented beautifully.
It would have been nice if there were more of the savory sandwiches as I prefer that myself but overall it was a lovely afternoon and sitting in the beautiful Atrium was just gorgeous.",4,2023,02,07
202,"Perfect Location, Friendly Staff","We stayed here on vacation and thought the location was perfect. Easy walking distance to all the Dublin sites, shopping, and restaurants.

Rooms were large and had nice furniture. Very friendly/helpful staff that made our trip a delight also assisted in dinner reservations. Would definitely recommend.",5,2023,02,06
202,Afternoon Tea at the Atrium for 10,"We booked an Afternoon tea as a surprise for my Mother's 90th birthday celebration, a weekend away with her daughter and grand daughters.  The service at the Atrium was outstanding, the tea, excellent, the surroundings just perfect. We enjoyed every minute. My Mother particularly enjoyed the beautiful China the tea was served in.
Istvan working in training as a concierge was so helpful and gave us a great welcome on our arrival. Proffessional but friendly. We certainly felt that my Mum along with all of us had been treated like Queens.",5,2023,02,05
202,An excellent location in Dublin but not quite 5 stars,"Our checkin was an early predictor of the weekend.  My wife and I entered the lobby and not a bellhop or concierge noticed, so we started carrying our luggage up the entry stairs to the check-in desks.  A nice gentleman quickly apologized for not seeing us and tried to help but we had already reached the reception desk.  Is better late than never really better?

The bedroom is lovely and appreciated the room upgrade despite my lowly Silver status.  The service in general feels attentive but mixed.  

Breakfast on Saturday morning was very rough despite the lovely manager (Sylvia?) who attempted to keep the breakfast from being a disaster.  I honestly think they were just understaffed but that isn‚Äôt a great excuse in a hotel of this caliber and cost.  It took 15 minutes to get coffee and at least another 10 to get the omelette and porridge.  The dining room was about 40% full at 10:30am and many people just walked in without waiting to be seated.  There were no drinking glasses or water or orange juice for that matter.   The buffet spread was pretty extensive and tasty - but not having the basics covered like water and clean glasses is inexcusable.  

There was some construction Saturday morning in the Mint bar which could be heard from our room in the 2nd floor but seemed to be complete by the evening.  The bartenders at the Mint were attentive if uninspired.   The live music was okay but the loudness of the room acoustics made it nearly impossible to appreciate the musician.  I do think the entire Mint staff really tried to provide  excellent service and it is a cool bar worth a visit for one drink!

The location of the Westin Dublin is fantastic, but I must say that the actual experience did not meet expectations for the price point.   We had stayed at a couple 4 star Irish owned hotels in Cork and  Malahide earlier in the trip and thought the service was superior.  The fit and finish of the Westin Dublin is superior but not perfect. 

The bed / sheets / shower are all great and 5-star.  The TV is amongst the most annoying of any hotel TV.  A black box appeared Saturday night and doesn‚Äôt disappear even when the unit is turned off (and even unplugged!).  There are also no drawers to unpack but the closet is pretty big.  

I feel cynical for bringing up some of these nitpicking points, but for the money, I think this hotel can do better.",3,2023,02,04
202,Wedding,"First and foremost, we would like to thank you and the rest  of the Westin Dublin staff for making our wedding day special and memorable for us.

We want to thank you for being so accommodating with all our queries before the wedding day. I know we've been bombarding you with emails. Thank you for being so patient and kind. 

Everything was perfect and was very easy for me and my family members from checking in until checking out. The rooms were very spacious. We were also delighted that you gave us one of the suites. It was a perfect venue for taking photos during the wedding preps. The view from the room was lovely too. 

We want thank you too for putting up the decors and all other bits and pieces and for taking them all down after the reception. Everything from the arrival reception down to the mint bar was spectacular. Food was great and it was right on time. We were able to finish by 5.30. 

We were also happy that the Westin gave us the red carpet arrival. We were not expecting it and we were caught off guard when we arrived after the photoshoot. Please extend our thanks to the bosses for putting up such great welcome for us newlyweds. We've been looked after by all the staff even in the Morelands Grill as well as the concierge.

Words are not enough to express our gratitude towards the Westin Dublin. It is definitely one for the books. We can't complain a single thing.",5,2023,02,04
202,Recommend 100%,"Great location, friendly staff, everything was impeccable. Breakfast had good variation of foods to choose. We got an upgrade when we got there. 100% recommended, felt like I was at home. The guys at the reception helped with everything and got us tickets when we couldn‚Äôt.",5,2023,02,02
202,Absolutely amazing hotel and staff,"I visited the amazing hotel as part of my solo trip to Ireland, and I 100% recommend it to everyone who is planning to travel to Dublin! The room I was assigned to was lovely, the shower was a pleasure and the bed is truly like heaven. Also the location is amazing as it's really close to every place you want to visit, and has the bus stop just in front of the entrance, so it's really easy to get the to airport that way if you don't plan to take a taxi.

I had the pleasure to be welcomed and checked out by Rhea who is truly professional and up to standards.

 I had a dinner in Morelands Grill, where Maria attented me with so much care and she was absolutely lovely! The breakfast staff was also delightful, although I unfortunately didn't get their names.

 The most amazing thing was that i went down for breakfast and when i got up to my room it was already made! Big thanks to the housekeeping team, who also delivered the items I asked for in a very short period of time! 

As i wasn't there for long (just two nights) i couldn't get to experience the rest of the restaurants but this way I have another excuse to go back to this hotel on my next trip to Ireland! Keep it up with your amazing staff! Thanks for making my stay amazing",5,2023,01,26
202,Birthday treat.,"Stayed in The Westin for my fiance√©s birthday and I cant wait to go back. Its so close to everything in Dublin city centre, literally a stones through. Hotel is luxurious but really welcoming. All staff were so warm and greeting and made our stay very special. Thanks so much to Joanne for the amazing suite and bottle of prosecco, it was a wonderful surprise. I highly recommend a stay here! You might even bump into some Irish rugby lads.... p.s. Weve been on the hunt for the scented candles in the lobby ever since. Ha. Cheers. üëç",5,2023,01,25
202,Relaxed stay in one of Dublin's best hotels,"We stayed in the Westin on 21st January and from the moment we walked in, there was a really good vibe about the hotel. We were greeted by Jake at reception who checked us in very efficiently and was very courteous and professional and gave us all the information we needed about the hotel.

Our room was spacious and impeccably clean, we also received a very warm greeting from Al who ensured our stay was one to remember.
The building which used to be a bank has it's bar where the banks vaults were located and again the staff we met there were very courteous to us.

Our stay was only for one night and when checking out the next morning Jelena made sure this was done with no fuss and very efficiently.

We would recommend this hotel with a moments hesitation.

",5,2023,01,25
202,Sir this was great!!!,From check in to check out they kept calling me sir which I loved. Having concierge park my car in their secure car park was great  but that was just the beginning. Inside was stunning and immaculate. Got checked in by Jelena who also advised where to have lunch since we were early to check in. On return I asked for a mobile key where Jake swiftly provided. At Marriott I always use a mobile key. It‚Äôs more handy. Headed to the bar after using the gym. Surai at the bar recommend the Opihr Oriental Spiced Gin which was what I needed. Going down with some nuts is the best. Room wise. We upgraded our room and I must say. The room was bigger than what the picture looks like. Big bed and plenty of space. Good size tv and somehow the toilet was large  too. Unable to cast to the tv like other Marriott hotels I stayed in but not the biggest problem. Never encountered any problems to be honest. Pressure on the shower and rain shower was brilliant. Would loved to have stayed longer but unable since we needed to head back home to Uk. Lastly thanks for the gifts left for us in the room by Mariana. This made our Chinese New Year extra special. Will be back next time am in Dublin. Thanks. ,5,2023,01,22
202,Great Hotel,"I have stayed in most of Dublin‚Äôs top hotels and The Westin is right up there at the top.
I had a beautiful suite that was beautifully furnished with every thought of comfort considered.
Breakfast was good with a decent buffet selection in addition to a cook to order a la carte menu.
Lunch in the Atrium was simple but good.
A couple of late night drinks in The Mint Bar rounded off a busy day.
All the staff that I interacted with were charming and helpful.
It will now become my hotel of choice whenever I am in Dublin.",5,2023,01,21
202,So relaxing,"Myself and husband stayed in the Westin over the Christmas period.  It is a great place to stay right in the centre of Dublin with easy access to O'Connell St and Grafton St.  Even though the hotel is in the centre of the city it was so relaxing and perfect.  The room was amazing, the staff where fantastic and the breakfast was filled us up for most of the day.   When we stay in Dublin again  we will definitely stay here again.",4,2023,01,20
202,Fantastic as usual,"Fantastic as USUAL - We had another great stay at the Westin Hotel, Dublin everything from arriving to leaving was exceptional again. Location the best in Dublin. Every staff member we met were so friendly and helpful- CANT WAIT TO GO BACK AGAIN THIS YEAR",5,2023,01,18
202,Birthday!,Wonderful stay in the Westin! Staff were wonderful. Great location. On temple bars doorstep. Rooms were out of this world. Our suite was fabulous. Stayed for one night only but was so comfortable and relaxing. Would highly reccomend,5,2023,01,18
202,Wedding review,"We chose the Westin as the reception venue for our wedding anniversary in July 2022. Having gotten married during the pandemic, it was fantastic to be able to celebrate with family and friends in a beautiful setting. The Westin is centrally located in Dublin which meant it was so easy for our international guests to find, and a well-known location for our Irish family and friends. 
The  Westin could not have been more helpful, kind and accomodating. From the tasting menu, the red carpet, the hard work of Eilish and the beautiful wedding suite facing College Green, it was perfect from start to finish!
The Westin was a wonderful experience for us as newly-weds, our Spanish guests as international visitors, and our Irish family. I only wish I could it all again! 
Thank you so much to The Westin, it truly is the best hotel in Dublin and an outstanding, first class experience. I look forward to being back again soon!",5,2023,01,18
202,Great service and fabulous hotel!,"I stayed in the Westin in September, as I wanted somewhere luxurious and relaxing to stay in Dublin city centre.  I was not disappointed! The staff were considerate, helpful and friendly.  The hotel is very central, as it's located close to Grafton street for shopping, restaurants, and going out.  Our room was pure luxury - comfortable beds and very spacious.  We also treated ourselves to the delicious Afternoon tea in the Atrium, which was the icing on the cake!",5,2023,01,17
202,Will definitely be back!,"Stayed here with my partner for 1 night and we will most definitely be returning! From the moment we arrived we were completely taken care of and all of the staff members we encountered were friendly and helpful. Our room was beautifully decorated, spotlessly clean and the bed was super comfy! Located right in the heart of the city, The Westin is the perfect spot for a luxury break in Dublin.",5,2023,01,17
202,"Amazing hotel, in a perfect location.","I stayed in The Westin for a long weekend. As you come into the hotel the luxury and opulence surrounds you. The bedrooms are as luxurious as the rest of the hotel. After a morning shopping in Grafton Street, we had a scrumptious afternoon tea which was served in the splendid Atrium, followed by a few cocktails in the Mint Bar. 
The breakfast was amazing and was just the cure after the cocktails the night before.",5,2023,01,17
202,"Exceptional hotel, great location","Beautiful room and great amenities. Afternoon tea was very impressive and in a great setting. The quality of food was what you'd expect from a 5 star hotel, but what really set it apart was the attention to detail from the staff ... from check-in to table service to little touches in the room - really made for a wonderful experience.  ",5,2023,01,17
202,December 2022 wedding,"We had our wedding in the Banking Hall recently and there is not one thing I could fault the hotel with. First class service from minute we met with Eilish (Co-ordinator) to checking out morning after the wedding. The banking hall room is stunning and the staff are amazing, our guests have also complimented the service and the food all day. It really was a 5 star service and would reccommend anyone to consider it for Dublin based wedding. ",5,2023,01,17
202,Good hotel and lovely afternoon tea!,"I had a lovely weekend with my sister and we stayed at The westin.

The hotel was nice and staff were friendly but we had a lot of issues with our room and had to complaint several times to reception, they were friendly to us but I don‚Äôt think they communicate between them so well to share what was happening with our room. (Flush was not working, cigarettes on the balcony and not very clean)

However, after we had a chat with the manager he was very kind and made sure we felt taken care of and offered us a lovely afternoon tea. The afternoon tea was delicious, very cozy and Christmassy atmosphere.",4,2023,01,15
202,Amazing,"Myself, my husband and my little girl stayed here for 2 nights over New year's eve. We were greeted with such warmth and the staff made such a fuss over our little girl which we felt was something very special. They made us feel so privileged during our entire stay. The hotel decor was amazing, bright and contemporary yet had a very warm homely feel. The bedrooms were immaculate, so clean and comfortable that we were reluctant to leave. The infamous Mint bar lived up to it's name, the staff were amazing, so charming and friendly yet very efficient and professional. The breakfast was also something very special, from the fresh homemade smoothies to the huge selection of fresh breads and that's not to mention the amazing hot buffet. I can not recommend this hotel enough and we can not wait to return. ",5,2023,01,12
202,Terrific stay,"Excellent location; friendly & helpful staff; wonderful breakfast.  Perfect home base for visiting Dublin - we walked almost everywhere.  Multiple fabulous restaurants within 1 mile, plus easy walking to Temple Bar area, Grafton Street, etc.",5,2023,01,07
202,Great New Years spot,"What a wonderful hotel. We received an upgrade thanks to Marriott rewards and we had a city view room overlooking Westmoreland Street. The reception desk was helpful and welcoming when we arrived. The room was wonderful - comfortable beds, big windows, and spacious bathroom. Allan at the concierge desk was super helpful with assisting us in obtaining taxis a couple times during our stay. Great location, near lots of fun activities and tour meet-up locations. Well done, Westin. Thank you for a stress free visit to Dublin.",5,2023,01,03
202,"Wow, a truly wonderful stress freeing stay!!!","After a very busy Festive period we stayed in The Westin on Friday Dec 30th and had a truly wonderful stress freeing stay and the best sleep we've had in a long time! 
Everything from the moment we arrived to our late departure was perfect.
A special Thanks to Yasmin and her fabulous team.
Keep up the great work!! 
Looking forward to our next visit!!

202,Christmas  ruined,"Lovely Hotel, great rooms, service, food,
UNTIL CHRISTMAS LUNCH!!
No parsnip, no carrot, no roast potatoes, broccoli.
But stewed sprouts and new potatoes!!
Cold Christmas pudding, no cream.
But they heated for us with custard.
Altrium lounge for cocktails, asked for vodka martini, got neat gin with 2 olives in?

Concierge and reception staff brilliant.

Restaurant and some bars need a bit of serious training.",3,2022,12,28
202,Christmas at the Westin,"The stay at the Westin was amazing. The staff were very welcoming, friendly, helpful and basically dropped everything to assist. That was for all the staff, concierges, porters, waitresses, receptionists and housekeepers. They made our Christmas away from home very comfortable. The beds are just like the name ‚Äúheavenly‚Äù and our meals were top class as well.",5,2022,12,27
202,Beautiful hotel in a great location!,I enjoyed my stay at the Westin. Dublin. The hotel staff is super friendly and knowledgeable. The concierge had great restaurant recommendations in Dublin for all types of cuisines! The hotel is also located near all the shops and sights. There is plenty to see and do within walking distance.,5,2022,12,15
202,Wonderful Hotel,"Fantastic location - close to many attractions 
The front desk, concierge & bell staff were extremely helpful & friendly. 
Our room was also very nice. 
The buffet breakfast had many options and excellent coffee ",5,2022,12,13
202,Beautiful hotel but room was cold,"- Hotel was lovely, very clean and well maintained. Staff were also respectful and helpful. 

- We stayed in the Library Suite, specifically the George Bernard Shaw suite. While the room was fabulous and featured a spiral staircase to an upper floor living area, the downstairs section where the bed was located was extremely cold, so much so that we had ask for a heater to be brought up to the room. For the cost of the room and the quality of the hotel this was definitely a disappointment and impacted on the overall experience.

- The Morelands Grill was lovely for dinner, with great warmth and very courteous staff. Food was also of a very high standard. The menu was also nice and simple, with no fussy items. 

- The breakfast was a huge buffet and had something for everyone, and the hot food items were hot unlike other hotel buffets. You could also order from a menu as well. 

- The Atrium Bar and Lounge was a very relaxing and warm area to sit and chat, however we couldn‚Äôt get afternoon tea as it was booked out both days. We didn‚Äôt realise we had to book this in which was a shame as we were looking forward to it. 

- The Mint Bar was incredibly unique and had live music and a huge menu of drinks and cocktails. There was also multiple TV‚Äôs which showed the football matches on that night. Well worth a visit if you are staying at the hotel. 

- In terms of location the hotel is unparalleled, having views of Grafton and O‚Äô Connell Streets, with a Luas stop just outside the front door. Defiantly an ideal location for a weekend in the city centre. 

- Concierge at the hotel was excellent, and we had no trouble getting a taxi the morning we left. 

Overall, our experience would have been 5 star had our bedroom not been cold. This is something that shouldn‚Äôt happen at any hotel, let alone one which such high standards and quality. Otherwise, the Westin is a hotel we will return due to the aforementioned qualities and location, however  we would choose a different room.",4,2022,12,11
202,Unbeatable location (update),"The Heritage Deluxe rooms are still being advertised as ""With stunning views of Dublin City Centre and Trinity College Dublin"". Our room 223 had an Atrium view.
Also I do find it disheartening when hotels say rooms have a bathroom (but there is no bath), though Marriotts are not unique in doing that.",3,2022,12,08
202,Pretty hotel but pretty disorganised!,"Great location and the hotel had been beautifully decorated for Christmas. 
However, a few snags!! Our kettle didn‚Äôt work, the room was dark and the bathroom had mould on the ceiling. Woken up by workman banging and drilling somewhere in the building. Three times we ordered drinks and they were forgotten. Ordered beans to go with my English breakfast which arrived after I‚Äôd finished my breakfast! Service was generally very slow and I had to clear my own table in order to have space to work. I ordered tea with breakfast which was forgotten. I got stuck in the lift for 20mins!!! I rang the alarm many times, in the end, the cleaner heard me banging on the door and opened the door. 
The floor in the lobby has a slope which caused several people to stumble. The staff were friendly but very clearly understaffed. For a 5*hotel at 5* prices, I would expect a much better experience.",3,2022,12,06
202,Good experience overall,"Lovely Hotel and a great location. All the staff were so friendly and we thought the breakfast was excellent. The rooms were lovely with everything you'd need. The hotel was beautifully done up for Christmas. 
We did find the bed room hot however and the air conditioning wasn't effective in cooling it. Only other issue was that we were woken before 8.20am by housekeeping who let themselves into our room.",4,2022,12,05
202,Amazing stay,"I had a pleasant stay at the Westin Dublin City hotel and I highly recommend this place. A big thank you to Yasmin who provided a very pleasant welcome.

Thank you for your kindness you were very helpful from the moment I arrived until it was time for me to leave.I were delighted. I had a great experience with the Jake at reception and the whole team, you are incredible, you were a great help! This hotel is perfect because it is close to all the main attractions and the shopping area. I couldn't recommend this place any more, I  will definitely come back! Thank you for everything!

Greetings,
Amadou thiaw",5,2022,11,30
202,Poor show Westin!,"Beautiful hotel but it‚Äôs all a bit of a facade. 
Room was ‚Ç¨2700 for 3 nights so not a meagre budget for a 5star in a major city. 
Room wasn‚Äôt serviced properly when we got in, no toiletries, the phone didn‚Äôt work and clearly a blockage of some description in one of the sinks, smell was terrible. 
Woke up the first morning to loud drilling going on. And , the second morning!! Building works not notified to guests or any idea how long they would last. Breakfast on the first day, was absolutely destroyed with no attempt to tidy things up for those coming after 9am.  Table was clearly not ready for us as most of the cutlery was missing with no butter and little milk. 
No concierge service in the afternoon when planning our trips. Couldn‚Äôt get room service. Rooms not serviced until after 4pm resulting in us having to wait whilst room was cleaned. Staff were polite but ineffective. 

Great location was The Westin Hotels saving grace.",2,2022,11,29
202,Felt like home!,"No excuses ""because of Covid""! Customer service was exceptional. As one reviewer said - it seemed more like a Ritz!  The hotel is absolutely beautiful and small enough to make you feel comfortable.

We arrived from the United States at 5 am, staying for 4 nights.  We were able to get into our room early in the morning and we were upgraded to a corner room. (Lifetime Platinum)  The room was spacious and immaculate and seemed to be recently updated. We unpacked and began our day!  Everything and everyone was of the highest standards.  There were plenty of outlets for everything we needed. Our room was cleaned perfectly every day (sheets changed, spotless bathroom and vacumed with turn-down service every night. I left a note asking for a few extras (water, lotion, soap) - no problem.  The bed was very comfortable! The only thing missing was a dresser to put clothes in but we used the shelf in the closet so it was fine. 

Stephen (door man/concierge), Robert, and David all went above and beyond to do everything they could for us! They made us feel special. Jeremy, Lana, Rhea, Rhein and everyone else we encountered at the front desk (I wish I had kept track of names) were always pleasant and helpful! They ALL went above and beyond for whatever we needed.  

The included full breakfast was perfect for us.  Everything from full Irish breakfast, pastries, fresh fruit, yogurt, cereals, salmon and fresh meats, and cooked to order omelettes, eggs, etc. as well as barista coffees.  The service was excellent here also.

The gym was adequate for our needs. (Although the website said it was closed but when I inquired before we left home, I confirmed that it was open!)

The hotel's location is absolutely perfect! Right across from Temple Street bar district and next to Trinity College.  Easy walk to Grafton Street shopping, St. Stephen's Green, The Little Museum of Dublin, Dublin Castle and more!  So much to do and see.

We will definitely be back and wouldn't want to stay anywhere else!",5,2022,11,28
202,Avoid. Better options available in Dublin,"The hotel and common areas are nice. The rooms are old. Refurbishment makes them fresh but it misses the mark. For eg. There are no usb chargers, there is one small window in many rooms, the cupboards are old. 

For a 5 star hotel charging ‚Ç¨400per night the mini bar was empty. 

I ordered some room service at night at 10.30pm. After weighting for an hour, when I called to enquire I was told that they have missed the order due to shift change and now items will not be possible. Very disappointed!",2,2022,11,23
202,"Great location, bad experience","I booked this hotel as a surprise for my partner's birthday for 3 nights. Location is brilliant, staff were so friendly and interior was decorated nicely, felt Christmassy. We also went to Mint Bar which was nice.
However we came across problems with our stay. After our first night, we had freezing cold water so couldn't have a shower after having travelled for hrs the day before. We rang reception, they said they were having problems and told us to keep the water running for 5mins to see if it warmed up. It didn't. We rang back and they said we could keep the water running, so we did and went out. Upon returning, the water was still ice cold and they said they weren't sure when it'll be fixed with it being a Sunday. I would've appreciated it if they'd rang first rather than me getting into the shower and having an accidental freezing shower and then having to ring reception multiple times. 
Mon & Tues morning - REALLY loud drilling for a long time, i recorded a video so I could show staff how loud it was.
I understand maintenance needs to be done but they could have waited until Lunchtime when most people are awake/not in instead of 9/9:30am. We had another guest knock on our door on Mon to complain because she thought the work was being done in our room, when it wasn't. We still never found out what it was.
Overall I was saddened, I was excited to stay here. It was a treat as i don't usually book 5*. As I said, the staff were nice and were willing to listen to our complaint.",3,2022,11,16
202,Impressive stay for our first time to Dublin,"Had a wonderful stay at the Westin! The hotel is lovely and the location cannot be beat.  The staff was polite and helpful but Rhea at the front desk deserves a special mention for the exceptional service she provided to us on our day of arrival. We arrived early, and understandably, our room was not ready. As Rhea assisted us, more people arrived behind us to check in. Rhea was professional throughout and took her time with us - while respecting the other guests‚Äô time. She really made an excellent and professional first impression. She is a real asset to the Westin.  We cannot say enough good things about how she handles the check in desk! 
The Breakfast options at the hotel were plentiful and we were very happy with our room. The bathroom is large, bed was very comfortable and we could not hear any noise from the busy streets. We would highly recommend the Westin for anyone wanting a luxury hotel in the heart of the city center.",5,2022,11,04
202,Great stay/location,Great hotel and location.    Lot of attractions within walking distance.   Hotel was clean and comfortable.     Got there real early in the morning and they were able to accommodate and get us in our room,5,2022,11,01
202,Westin Dublin,"I had a very disappointing stay, from small details to larger matters, I find this not acceptable, especially for the price paid. Not a 5 star experience.

Customer service was poor:
-No one answered the phone on numerous attempts.
-Maid service laughed as a patron passed them speaking in another language and laughing, the patron turned to me and asked if the staff was making fun of them, I felt sad by this experience, it did appear that they were making fun of them.

Valet parking:
It was awkward and no one comes to assist you.
You leave your car on the street, around the corner of the hotel and walk with your luggage to the desk inside.

Room:
-A challenge to find my suite as I was given a room number at check in, my suite had a name on the door, not a room number. Very confusing.
-Poor light in bedroom,  atmospheric but not practical. 
-The shower: I have had better showers in hostels back in my backpacking days. The shower was dirty, the door to the shower did not close (causing the floor to be flooded with water), no shelf to place your personal items on, you had to place them on the dirty floor.
-No sink stopper.
-There were partly used mini bottles of shampoo by the tub.
-No luggage rack.
-Tiny cup for tea... a mug would be more appropriate. 
-Do not disturb sign was not honored.
-No robe.

Breakfast:
-Slow line to be seated.
-Very low, dim lighting, like for a formal dinner, it is the morning! Light would be appropriate. 
-Omelette was rubbery. 
+Fresh honey.
+/- a selection of Irish cheese but cheese not labeled.
-Bananas were previously refrigerated. 
-No milk on table empty pitcher.
-My fork and knife where taken when they brought my eggs, they did not bring me a new set. I had to hunt another set down.
-Coffee/tea lids did not fit on the take away cups. 
+Water bottles were available in the lobby for morning runners, nice touch.

Safety issues: 
-The floors in the lobby are very uneven. 
-The carpet near the bed was loose and buckling.
-The suite I had was on 2 levels, if you have any mobility issues or small children I would be cautious of the room you choose. The stairs that connect the two floors are steep and on a spiral staircase.

We are still in a pandemic. The head concierge,  older gentlemen was obviously sick, coughing consistently,  didn't cover mouth. I understand that it is a choice to wear a mask or not, but I do not appreciate when someone is obviously sick and not taking action to keep others from catching whatever they have.

Check out:
- I informed the attendant behind the counter of the issues that needed repair and cleaning, I felt as if the person did not care one way or another. This attitude could be why the problems were there to begin with. 

-I did not appreciate it when I was told that I should have called down to notify them earlier, I do not want to move rooms once settled and I do not want maintenance in the room disrupting my stay/privacy. 

Location:
Excellent but I can not recommend staying here for the price paid and the numerous issues I experienced. A hotel that charges as much as this one does should have rooms that are kept to a much higher standard.

",2,2022,10,30
202,Superb,"Had a perfect weekend with the wife here, staff were great, food lovely and hotel looked amazing with it‚Äôs super cool decor. We used the grill and the tea lounge both perfect, and then the mint bar for a late evening with live music which was brilliant.",5,2022,10,29
202,Could Not Have Picked a Better Place,"I want to add my voice to the others by giving this hotel 5 stars. (If there were 6 stars available, I'd check that.)  Because of the flight's schedule, my wife and I arrived at the hotel at 5:45 a.m. Even though check-in was at 3 p.m., the kind woman at the front desk felt our jet lag and exhaustion and was able to get us into a room in about 30 min. She was a lifesaver! And things kept getting better: The expansive breakfast, location, room, etc. Bravo to the hotel staff who made a difference in our first Dublin visit. Service is in their DNA. If I didn't see the Westin sign on the front, you could have told me we were staying at a Ritz, and I'd believe you!",5,2022,10,26
202,"Great location, and that was the only thing that was great.  Cavernous rooms.","There are some things to like, but overall I'll take a pass on value for money and organization/service.

What's to like:  the location, very close to lots of function action downtown.   Some of the people (somewere great, some acted like they were on Mars.)

What's not to like:  the rooms (cavernous and dark, I had a king bed, with one small window and long wraparound hallway -- and that was the room I moved to after I got too clustraphobic in the first). the thermostat (did nothing as far as I could tell).  So right there, they've got the two reasons I'd stay at a Westin in Europe -- I want nice American style room where I can set the temperature to my standards, not Euro standards.  Neither worked.  The breakfast (pricey, mandatory (you can't order a la carte, but you can order supplements to the already 27 Euro buffet.  Breakfast was consistently chaotic and crappy.)  

What are some nits:  the floor is not level in the lobby and I saw several people almost trip, including me.  It's not sloped enough to pose a serious threat but to the weak-kneed you almost feel like you're going to fall.  They should really mark it or put steps.

Overall, disappointment:  for 500 Euros or so a night I'd hope for a lot more in an American brand hotel in Europe.",3,2022,10,20
202,Climate control a real issue,"The hotel staff was very helpful throughout my 5 day stay.  Food was ok, nothing special.  The biggest take away was that they had significant issues with room temps.  We were placed in an interior room which did not have windows that opened to the air.  Our room was an interior room that minimized noise but did not have windows that could be opened.  The room were were originally assigned was HOT and we could not cool it down.  The staff moved us to another room but the same issue to a slightly lesser degree (pardon the pun) persisted.  In that the hotel was full, we were out of options and SOL.

The staff indicated to us that the temperature issue was an ongoing problem.
",3,2022,10,19
202,Best location and friendly staff,"You can't beat the location. I would say it's the best in Dublin. The staff is incredibly friendly and made us feel so welcome the entire trip. The building itself was an old bank and the bar The Mint was the old safe which we thought was a great little spot. We didn't do the afternoon tea, but our room was overlooking the courtyard where the tea was and it looked like a great time. The only downside was the ventalation in our room was not great which caused it to be really warm. The staff brought us up a Dyson fan for my bedside table and it worked great. Our grown kids room didn't have the same issue. Would easily stay at The Westin again. ",5,2022,10,19
202,Perfect location,The best of locations possible. Everything centrally is walkable. Staff extremely accommodating.  Be sure to look up Alan at concierge.  He is a wealth of information so willing to help with any questions.  Breakfast included and superior in quality.  Most definitely would stay here again,5,2022,10,19
202,Exactly right for us,"The Westin is wonderful.  Great, central location that makes everything easy.  Helpful friendly staff.  Luis was so helpful, even standing in the rain to hail us a taxi in rush hour.  The best, however, was concierge Allan.  Jovial, entertaining and he knows all the places to go.  Really made our trip something special.  ‚ÄúTell them Allan sent you ‚Äú.  Definitely recommend. You can‚Äôt go wrong with Allan and the Dublin Westin.",5,2022,10,19
202,Wonderful stay!!,"My partner and I had a wonderful stay! The hotel is located in the cuty centre and is walking distance to everything! 
We stayed for our anniversary and all staff were so kind they even left us a gift in the room. Staff are very helpful, check in was very quick and efficient and concierge helped us organize a day tour. 
Our room was lovely. We stayed in a room facing The Atrium and it was cozy and quiet. 
This is my new favorite hotel in Dublin!!! 100% recommended!!! ",5,2022,10,16
202,Wonderful Staff Great Location,Just returned from an amazing 3 night stay at the Westin in Dublin. Great location across from the Templebar District and a short walk to everywhere in Dublin. The staff were just amazing and so helpful. Cant wait to return next fall.,5,2022,10,14
202,Hot and Airless in rooms,"The people at the Westin were great.  They moved us to another room when ours was too hot and brought me ice for my swollen ankle.  Every staff member from housekeeping to the front desk were pleasant and helpful.  

BUT, the bedrooms were very hot and very dry and no one could make them cooler.  There is no place to put your clothes but the closet.  I was disappointed and uncomfortable",3,2022,10,13
202,Superb Doorman Service!!,"Our visit started with superb curbside assistance from the parking attendant He was getting off duty and even doubled back after clocking out to be sure we were taken care of A true rarity in this day in age 
Our experience continued with all Door Men we encountered in our stay Helpful courteous and always offering a friendly advice and assistance",4,2022,10,03
202,Perfect location lovely hotel!,"Wonderful hotel and in a perfect location for visitors! We stayed in a 1 King Bed, Heritage Deluxe room. It was on the smaller side but not uncomfortably small by any means. Everything in the room was updated and the bathroom was surprisingly big and beautiful! 
The hotel was very helpful with making restaurant and activity recommendations and the entire staff was incredibly friendly! 
The hotel is located right off of temple bar so there is lots of day and night activity to see. Tons of live music and fun pubs but all locals will tell you its full of tourist (which holds up). 
We didn‚Äôt get a chance to get tea at the hotel but it did look lovely. Our room faced inward towards the courtyard of the hotel which looked down at the tea. This was a little odd but we still felt we had lots of privacy. 
We also went to an Irish Football game at Croke Park while there and were able to walk there and back which i would highly recommend. If you did catch a game at Croke Park be sure to hit the bars along the way there. There‚Äôs a street of them filled with locals, everyone was extremely friendly!",5,2022,10,02
202,Good stay,I stayed here the week before last and it was a really good stay. Check-in was quick and the reception team helped me to print out the import documents. The Atruim was relaxing and quiet and the Mint Bar had good cocktails.,5,2022,10,01
202,So helpful,We stayed in room 433 during our stay in The Westin. My partner sufferers from back problems and needed additional seating area. The housekeeping manager was so helpful she gave us 2 extra sofas and my husband couldn't been happier. We also got some great recommendations for some lovely restaurants off the concierge team. Overall it is a lovely place with amazing staff.,5,2022,10,01
202,Day trip to the Wicklow Mountains with private driver.,"The concierge suggested a private car for our Wicklow visit. While I'm sure they have many excellent drivers, Brian Reilly is simply the best. Outstanding, we saw coastal villages, Enya's home, the Guiness Estate, and many others. We never would have seen or learned on our own without him. His knowledge, pride, and passion for Ireland made our full day trip very special.",5,2022,09,20
202,"Just an average Hotel now, used to be great!","Our last stay at the Westin was very disappointing, and due to the issues we had with some staff members. the experience has completely changed my view on the hotel and we will probably now look for somewhere different to stay that appreciates us better. 

We had 3 distinct incidents of poor staff attitude that is most definitely not expected from a 5 star hotel, the worst one was the denial of breakfast when we arrived at 10.05am and we were told the kitchen was closed at 10am. Being spoke to like a child in a half full breakfast room, and being denied entry was very embarrassing. 

My work takes me to London, Dublin and parts of Europe and we always choose 5 start quality hotels due to the nature of what we do, we are very lucky to experience excellent hotels and great service so when we see poor service, it is very obvious and disappointing. 

We did ask for the manager to contact us to discuss the issues however we are still waiting for a response, that shows signs of unappreciative and arrogant attitudes. In the past the Westin has been an excellent hotel and we have been staying there for the last 10 years while working in Dublin and during my daughters time at university, however the last stay shows us that we need to seek somewhere that is more appreciative. We would not recommend this hotel at this time..",3,2022,09,20
202,Wonderful hotel,Friendly checkin service and responsive to where we wanted our room to be. Room is spacious with a well appointed bathroom. Nice and quiet heat/AC unit.TV is unusual with a movable arm to articulate toward bed or the sitting area. Bed and bedding good with nice drapes.,5,2022,09,14
202,Great 5 star welcome and Stay,"I received a very warm welcome from the Doorman on arrival, who went out of his way to greet me at the side of the hotel and assist with luggage having arrived by taxi.  
The welcome didnt stop here as I was met by a very friendly reception team and the tone of the stay was set.

My room was very clean and had a fresh modern feeling. Overall a very comfortable stay with a great atmosphere. Cannot beat the location for exploring Dublin and most importantly very friendly staff.",5,2022,09,13
202,Terrible end to a great stay in the city.,"I'm sure you could have a good stay if you got the right room.  We were 'upgraded' to one that had a club outside the window until 1am.  The hotel has known about the problem for years as is evident from the posts online but when you call they first act like they don't know what you are talking about and then slowly explain that can't do anything about it. Then tell you that they will note you want a quiet room in the future.  Like not wanting your bed to shake and less a few hours of sleep is a special request. 

The hotel should now rent out these rooms until they change the winders and add noise-canceling curtains and whatever else.  

I stayed at the Conrads for most of the trip and that was great.  If you have to stay at the Westin, ask to not be given a room in the back where the private club is.  I've stayed at 100s of hotels and this ranks there with the dump near the Calcutta train station but at least that one didn't cost much.",2,2022,09,13
202,Nice old hotel,"It looks to have been a very grand hotel and might currently be a little past it's prime - but they delivered on what they advertised. Great location. Super helpful and friendly staff. We booked two basic rooms for two nights (parents and two adult kids). Platinum status got us a room that was a little larger than the kids. Both were in quiet spots, clean, and nicely appointed. All good on that front. The breakfast was great - lots of options, high quality food, again super friendly staff. Appreciate that it was included with platinum status! Special thanks to the concierge, who had lots of great advice and arranged the nicest driver to take us to the airport. We would definitely return!",5,2022,08,31
202,Used to be a nice hotel,"While the hotel still has a nice concierge to help you with your bags when you enter, decent rooms, and the Morelands Grill restaurant, it is easy to tell that this hotel is on the decline.  

We had quite a bit of BLACK MOLD in our bathroom's shower as well as in the shower in the room that I booked for my parents.  We called the concierge to have someone take care of this in both bathrooms our first day since we were only there for a day and a half, but they never even sent anyone.",3,2022,08,29
202,What a spot for a weekend break,I had planned a trip away to a hotel as I wanted a break away from home and work. When I say I picked a good choice I couldn‚Äôt be convinced there is somewhere better. Everything from the room to the food to the service of staff. Immaculate attention to customer service. Two people who left an incredible impression on me were Liam and Senem in the Resturaunt. I could tell how personally they take their jobs in making sure that my stay was perfect. The chef in the restaurant also deserves attention as I am a picky eater and every bite of my dinner was savoured. Thank you to the Westin for giving me the break I needed and I‚Äôll be sure to come again,5,2022,08,29
202,Perfect Overnight Stay!!,"We stayed here one night at the end of our cruise vacation. The hotel is beautiful! The front desk and concierge staff are superb and incredibly helpful. The hotel is in an ideal location, central to most everything you might want to see, with lots of bars, restaurants, and shopping just steps away. We had high tea on the Mezzanine (offered daily) and it was superb. The service, champagne, three plates of sandwiches, scones, and sweets were all served on William Edwards Reed pattern serve ware. The best part of the high tea, however, was the beautiful and relaxing background music. I could have sat there for hours. Drinks in the downstairs Mint Bar were great as well. The bar used to be a huge bank vault long ago. Our server was delightful and had stunning, long braided hair. We enjoyed every aspect of our stay here. We highly recommend and we will return, as soon as possible.",5,2022,08,23
202,"Great location, breakfasts very good, maid service very lacking.","Overall, our stay was okay.  We spent 3 nights here.  The staff in the restaurant and the concierge were all quite helpful and pleasant.  The maid service was minimal though.  The first 2 nights, the maid from days left our dirty water and wine glasses on the desktop.  The 3rd night when we returned, we were thankful to see clean glasses.  Upon closer inspection though, they were the same dirty ones, just rinsed and slightly dried.  And one of them had a chip in the rim.  The Nespresso machine was great, only I had to call down for refills of the pods, and sweeteners.  This all sounds like little things, but they add up, and it makes me glad I‚Äôd wiped the room down myself, because of the lackadaisical care and upkeep of our room.  The room was pleasantly quiet from outdoor noise, but not from slamming doors in the hallway.",3,2022,08,19
202,The place to stay in Dublin,"Hotel was a great location making the city of Dublin very walkable from your room. Staff at the hotel were very eager to assist you with directions, dining recommendations, places to tour, etc. breakfast was a real treat with so many selections.",5,2022,08,16
202,"Some rooms are good, some not so good","My husband and I have stayed twice at this property over the past week, both times for two nights.  Our first stay was in a very nice junior suite.  The second time was for the same category but upon entering the room two things were very clear: 1. The air conditioning was NOT working despite being turned to 61 Fahrenheit and 2. The bathroom was in serious need of upgrade attention (mildew around the tub had been caulked over and not very well at that).  I simply could not, during this time of higher temperatures, be in a hot room.  The receptionist was very kind and did move us to a beautiful suite - obviously redone and with functioning air, and that made our stay most pleasant.
Our first stay had one glaring issue ‚Äî our room, at 5 pm, had still not been serviced and we had dinner reservations plus Riverdance tickets‚Ä¶.and my golfer sorely needed a shower.  That meant I had to hunt someone down to come in - then he rushed to be ready, which made for a less than ideal start to our evening and two week trip.
Our group is 10 couples arranged for a golf trip by my husband as the leader and a UK golf tour company.  
I have stayed at many Westins across the US and this one is nice ‚Äî superb staff and perfectly located next to Trinity college and the famous Temple Bar area (and Grafton street).  This is a huge plus.  
But the rooms are not created equal across the categories.   Perhaps some are in the midst of renovation but they ought to not be reserving unless things are in presentable and working order.  Non functioning a/c is a deal breaker for a middle aged woman.  So is a bathroom with obvious need for improvement.   For these two reasons I took the stay from a 5 star to a 4‚Ä¶‚Ä¶and the 4 is not a 3 only because the staff was so very kind and professional across the board, from doormen and valets to reception and restaurants.
We will stay for one night prior to our departure home to the states, and my expectation is that we‚Äôll land and leave.
Would we stay at this property again?   There are many other options in the city and because consistency is important to this traveler, I might be inclined to give them a try.",4,2022,08,13
202,Perfect high tea,"the high tea was so nice and exquisite, scones were warm and everythibg was so fresh.
Service was amazing, the staff is so friendly and accomodating.
Tea selection was great,

202,TINY ROOMS!,"We have stayed at the Westin several times with pleasure, enjoying the world class afternoon tea in the Atrium Lounge; but we had rooms that we now understand are in the category ""junior suite"" or above.  (Caution:  Marriott's website is designed to make it very hard to find the room you want.)  It turns out that any room in a lower category (Classic, Deluxe, and Heritage Deluxe) will probably be a little over 200 square feet including bathroom and will not be large enough for two adults to share.  Some have been ""renovated"", which means basically removing furniture, so the first room we had was furnished with a bed, a table about 2'x3', a single straight chair for that table, and a 6"" ledge under the TV on the wall.  When we complained, we got an equally cramped room with an uncomfortable daybed.  The staff were very nice and tried hard, but the room stock they have is just not satisfactory for a multi-star hotel and the creation of different categories of room that are all the same tiny size makes it worse and the website makes it worse still.  They charge well over 500 Euros a night for these rooms.",2,2022,08,09
202,Short but very nice and pleasant stay,"Stayed here for just 4 nights but it was very pleasant. The staff starting from Mr. Hubernel Gonzalez at the front desk, and to all the crew at the Concierge desk and the Moreland Restaurant were all very helpful, attentive and well informed about their jobs. Our assigned room was well kept and the housekeeping staff were pleasant.
The hotel is ideally located in the heart of Dublin making it very easy to navigate to all points of interest. Dinner at Moreland was impeccable! The complimentary breakfast was great!",5,2022,08,05
202,A nice hotel but perhaps not a five star yet....,"We went to the Westin Dublin and our stay did not start well.  I had reserved a large suite (800 sqf) and when we got to our room, it was half that size.  The front desk explained that the room I had reserved is in renovation so they gave us a ""lower level"" room but without calling us first or even tell us at the registration.  And of course, they had not reduced the price.  Now that was the first time I heard that excuse and I've heard them all.  They finally gave us a suite that was very nice.  But they should have been much more pro-active.

So the room was very nice, with a second floor and nice bathroom. And the windows were double so we heard almost no noise from outside. 

I must say the the location is perfect near great restaurants and typical Irish pubs. And you are very close to the famous library of Trinity College.

Sadly, on the morning at 7am, some banging started that we clearly heard in our room.  Renovations? Who knows? The hotel - of course - said that it was not them (weren't they renovating the suite that I had reserved?).

Finally, we did not want our room to be serviced.  So we left the sign ""do not disturb"" all the time.  Nevertheless, that did not stop the maid: she wanted to do her routine and did not care for the sign.  That would be unthinkable at a Four Seasons.  So one other reason I don't believe this hotel warrants its fifth star.

At the end of the stay, the front desk did not ask the usual question: ""How was your stay?"".  Perhaps they feared the answer. 

It was my first time in Dublin so I don't know about the other hotels.  I can't say if it is better than the other hotels in the city.",3,2022,07,29
202,Perfect Place to Stay!,"We stayed at The Westin July 17-23, 2022!  The location was perfect-attractions, restaurants, and shopping are just footsteps away.  When we were heading someplace that was not within walking distance, it was easy to get a cab or get on the tram.  The rooms were clean and comfortable.  The staff was friendly and helpful.  
I contacted the conceirge prior to our visit for day trip tour company recomendations.  They responded almost immediatley with several options and then booked the trips for us.  There were NO hiccups and the private tours exceeded our expectations.  
The tours The Westin arranged for us couldn't have been more perfect!  Brian, our guide for Wicklow, Howth and Malahide was a huge hit with us!  He had a great sense of humor, adapted the tours to meet our needs, had great knowledge of all things Irish and was a joy to spend time with.  Amanda was our guide for the Cliffs of Moher trip.  She too was a joy to spend time with.  She was flexible, enagaing, good humored and knowledgeable.  Our experience would not have been the same without both of them!
We would stay at this hotel again and would recommend it to anyone visiting Dublin!",5,2022,07,26
202,Zero Consideration for Marriott Status - Just an average Westin.,"Just okay. Let me start with the fact we are hotel snobs. I spend a lot of time in hotels for business and when you travel that much you learn was good and not. This place is just average. A warning to Bonvoy member. Don‚Äôt expect anything. I am life time Ambassador (meaning I spend a lot of time and money at Marriotts) and I got nothing and I didn‚Äôt any get my preferred high floor.  The rooms are a good size but it didn‚Äôt even have a desk to work at. The room was clean and the beds and pillows are good. The shower is okay but the towels are harsh. The room has two chairs that don‚Äôt match and set next to a low table. Not usable for much and you can‚Äôt even watch the tv from them. (pictures attached to review) The TV doesn‚Äôt have internet so no streaming and only local TV with a couple of international news stations. The staff was very good and friendly. The restaurants  are okay but nothing to rave about. 

This is suppose to be one of the three best in Dublin. I would hate to see the rest. Also I won‚Äôt stay hear again. For the money I will try one of the other two. Plus I won‚Äôt stay here for the simple fact that there is zero consideration for Marriott status.",3,2022,07,26
202,Great location,Great location in Dublin city center. Staff very professional and attentive. Room very comfortable and quiet. The Buffet breakfast  very good. My daughter liked the gym. I would definitely stay here again if I return to Dublin.,5,2022,07,23
202,the best thing is the fabulous location,"its a very nice hotel, excellent sized rooms, and an amazing location, right in the middle of everything, the only drawback is the staff.. they manage to get it about 70% right, but never quite all the way, true for the restaurant, the room service, the cleaners, the only exception are the concierges, they are terrific, but be patient with them, I think they are all new and really untrained and the restaurant has a very limited menu and its very casual indeed, but since its so well located there are many really good ones close to them..i",4,2022,07,23
202,Great location makes it worth it,"We recently spent two nights at the Westin, one at the start of our trip and one at the end.  The location was perfect for us so we could easily walk to sights and restaurants of interest to us.  The front desk staff were very pleasant and eager to please, but the hotel was quite busy with many events so I think they are sometimes hard-pressed to deliver personalized service.  On our first stay, the front desk person clearly worked hard to get us into a room while we waited in the lobby about 30 minutes.  On the return stay, the front desk person told us it would just be a ""minute"", sent us to some lobby chairs located right in her line of sight, and that's where we sat for nearly an hour until my husband went to check a second time.  We were told ""oh, we tried to call you"" -- when we were sitting 20 feet away and my phone happened to be turned off.    Having said that, both of our rooms were quiet, cool (air conditioning works great), wifi worked perfectly, and the entire hotel is in great condition.  We'd stay there again, mostly due to location, although the room rates are exceptionally high.  We did not have a breakfast package but there is a nice, quiet Starbucks a few doors away where we could have coffee every morning.",4,2022,07,22
202,We Really Enjoyed The Westin,"We arrived at the Westin running late for a tour.  It was my fault but once we explained what was happening while checking in, the staff, led by Renee jumped into action.  They got us checked in, bags set aside since the room wasn't ready, car stowed in valet and a cab hailed so we could make it.  Amazing!

During check in I was informed that due to my room preference we were moved to a room with an interior window.  It was so quiet and we didn't mind that we didn't have a view of the city.  Sometimes peace and quiet are the best experience.

The room itself was very comfortable.  It had an odd shape due to the age of the building and was fun (really, we're weird) to figure out how to set things up for us.  The bathroom was a nice experience with a shower that due to my height, I barely fit in, but had the best water pressure of any hotel I've staid in.  Only odd thing was the lack of outlets in the bathroom, but it was a minor inconvenience.  

The hotel is situated in the perfect place for us and what we were doing.  It was a quick walk to Temple Bar and the light rail stop is right in front of the hotel.  Between the light rail and cabs we didn't need the car until it was time to leave for other cities.

Last, but not least is the staff.  Everyone we encountered, or that I pestered to get something out of the car I forgot, or extra keys I needed because I kept locking myself out of the room was extremely gracious and polite.  We really appreciate the care and concern demonstrated by everyone we met, it made the trip that much more fun.

Overall, we are looking forward to another visit to Ireland and we will start and end our trip at the Westin for sure.",5,2022,07,18
202,NIGHTMARE,"I have been staying at the Westin for 15 years, approximately 4-6 times a year. I never even thought of staying anywhere else in Dublin until now. 

I arrived on the 29th of June at 12:30, I specifically stated to the concierge on hand, who has been there for awhile now, that incidentals were to be on one card and room on another. He told me not a problem he will settle it with the front desk and not to worry.  Just to be safe, I doubled checked and the card that was to be used for incidentals, was charged my entire charge for my stay. So front desk had to reverse the charges and do it correctly. 

Next came my luggage, after waiting a little over an hour for my luggage, I called down asking if someone could please bring it up. I was told ‚Äúright away‚Äù. After waiting another half hour I went downstairs. The seasoned concierge, who told me he would personally handle my luggage, was on break so the concierge in training showed me to both storage rooms and my luggage was not at either. He mic‚Äôd the concierge on break and the concierge told him he‚Äôd look into it when he got done with his break. By this time I am livid. Come to find out, the concierge put my luggage in someone else‚Äôs room! 

Next the room‚Ä¶. While the room renovations are nice and we‚Äôre overdue, what‚Äôs not nice is sitting on the floor in the entry way of room because that is the only mirror in the room where a woman can do her hair! What the heck?!?!?  Don‚Äôt even try to put your makeup on there as there is little to no light by the hall mirror.  When I went downstairs to ask for a table and mirror to be brought up to my room I was told,‚Äùthere‚Äôs a lighted mirror in the closet‚Äù are you kidding me? Even the Moxy and Aloft I‚Äôm sure has mirrors and settings to get ready at in their rooms and they are a third of the price. (Both my original stay and return from Cork stay had rooms like this) 

Next let‚Äôs move on to how poorly I was treated by the night staff on my return stay starting July 10. 

While out with friends, yes we were out past midnight so we had to use the intercom to get in, yes we had drinks, I was told over the intercom I was not registered at the hotel so I could not come in. (Mind you I‚Äôm a platinum member and lifetime gold so I‚Äôm on a list when staying there) I repeated myself and gave my room number again and they asked my husband‚Äôs name.   No husband.  They finally buzzed me in and were waiting for me lined across the foyer block cling the elevator.  The night manager proceeded to state their systems were down so they were going off a register list. All of which is ridiculous bs. I showed them my if, my room card and room envelope and told them to move as I was going to my room.  Once I got to my room at 1:30 am, MY DOOR WAS OPEN WITH THE SLIDE BAR PROPPING IT OPEN! Turned down service left my room open since 9PM!!!!! 

The next day I spoke with my all time favorite, Stephen, and told him of last night‚Äôs happenings and he was very apologetic and got Alan, the front desk manager, right away. Stephen is by far one of the greatest assets the Westin has. 

Next let‚Äôs talk about items I wanted to ship home, of which I was told would not be a problem at all, they will call DHL. 

Robert graciously found me a box (Robert is an excellent addition to the Westin) I brought the box downstairs and the seasoned concierge (yes same that originally put my luggage in the wrong room) said he would take care of it for me no problem. He stated he would put the packing slip receipt with tracking number under my door of my room. Well that did not happen! When I came back from a bit of shopping and realized this concierge was off for rest of the day, I asked Collum (another brilliant addition to the Westin, if my box was picked up, both him and Robert looked for it, and it was in storage room, no packing slip, (mind you I already was charged by DHL for the shipping cost) and no instructions for them as to where the heck the label was for my shipment. Thankfully Collum tracked it down after he had to call the ‚Äúseasoned‚Äù concierge at home to ask where it was. 

And lastly, a bottle of champagne was delivered to the hotel with my name on it on 7/4/22. I checked out 7/5/22 to leave for Cork. No one notified me of the delivery. It was only on 7/11/22 (I was checking out AM if 7/12/22) when Collum was looking everywhere for the packing slip for my shipment home, that he found the champagne sitting in the storage room. Obviously I could not pack it in my suitcase to bring home the next morning so I hope housekeeping enjoyed the champagne I left in the room. 

Between all f the above, no cleaning of the room, exception of three days of my seven days there, no replacement of toilet paper or coffee or water (water and toilet paper were replenished the 3 days my rooms were cleaned) I‚Äôm really questioning my loyalty to the Westin. Can Peter please come back or spend more time at the Westin.  

If it wasn‚Äôt for Stephen, I would not even entertain staying there again.",2,2022,07,15
202,Disappointed with room.,Hotel centrally located but unfortunately we were given a room which essentially felt like an attic. It had a skylight and two extremely small port hole windows high up so that you could not even look out which we were very disappointed with and was not what we had requested/booked.  Paying that much money for a room I expected better.,3,2022,07,15
202,Nice Stay at the Westin Dublin,"I stayed here 5 nights for business and for the weekend.  As a Titanium Elite member, they upgraded by room to a nice front-end with a view, but that was about the only unique benefit they offered.

The hotel is in a GREAT location...couldn't be better.  It is in converted beautiful building right next to Trinity University.  Gym is sub-par but they have a deal with the Trinity University's Fitness center about a 5 minute walk away, where guests can access for free, which was very nice.

It has a nice bar/pub area in the basement and a pub/tea room on the mezzanine, both with very different but nice atmospheres.  

Only cons were the concierge service was hit or miss...one couldn't have been more helpful and the other was borderline rude and snobbish.  

I would definitely stay here again...no question about it.",5,2022,07,13
202,Good choice in Dublin,"Great hotel, nicely located in the middle of the action.  Staff is attentive, rooms are super clean.   The beds maintain Westin high comfort standards. Breakfast buffet was convenient and food was great.  We particularly enjoyed the Mint bar in the evening as well as having a pot of tea in the atrium lounge.",5,2022,07,12
202,Good location,"Well situated near many tourist areas (GPO, Temple Bar, Trinity College). Can be confusing to maneuver with different paths to rooms on certain floors. Very friendly staff and good breakfast. Bar is nice (Mint), but feels like it is in a dungeon with no windows and low lighting.",4,2022,07,10
202,Great location to everything,"Located in the heart of Dublin and next to Trinity College, this made our 5 days here easy to access the shopping areas, eating, drinking, music, pubs, bus pick up (tours) and the great donut shop across the street.  I would have given The Dublin Westin 5 stars but this hotel struggled some in the housekeeping/service related areas.  It appeared they just weren‚Äôt properly staffed or trained or both.  We travel quite a bit and unfortunately this is more common than it should be.  I would definitely come back here as I cannot imagine a full-service hotel better located.",4,2022,07,10
202,Great place to stay central to Dublin,My husband and I stayed at The Westin Dublin for 5 nights and had a great experience. The staff was very responsive and friendly and the accommodations were great. We ate breakfast at the Morelands Grill every morning and it is an amazing spread! The location of this hotel us absolutely perfect fir anyone wanting to explore Dublin‚Ä¶with 5-10 minutes walking distance of everything in the Temple Bar area and easy access to public transportation and taxi service. We will definitely look to stay here again if we‚Äôre ever in Dublin again!,5,2022,07,10
202,Best Hotel in Dublin!,"This property provided one of the best stays in Ireland I‚Äôve had! Great location, amazing staff and amenities and the rooms are generous and well kept. I‚Äôve been to Ireland several times and this by far was my favorite hotel in Dublin. I highly suggest you stay here and say hi to Stephen and Alan at the front!",5,2022,07,09
202,Perfect end to our tour of Ireland!,"We stayed at the Westin Dublin at the end of our 2 week tour of Ireland.  It was a great place to relax and enjoy the city. The location was perfect to venture out to see the sights and to shop. We arrived early and they graciously allowed us to check into our room which was fantastic especially since we were traveling with kids. The room was spacious and comfortable and after a long day out we loved enjoying a drink in their beautiful Atrium Bar (only wish they had a stronger appetizer and snack menu). The only downside was we were not impressed with their on property restaurant - Morelands Grill. The food was just average for the price we paid and the service was really slow. We ate dinner at the restaurant one evening and tried to have breakfast their one morning but the wait was too long. However, there are plenty of options really close to the hotel for a quick bite or fine dining so this was not a problem for us. We would definitely stay here again and would highly recommend for any occasion.",5,2022,07,09
202,Great location,"I wanted a centrally located hotel with restaurant and comfort as one of my party has mobility challenges. The room - double queen faces onto the Main Street. Bedding was beautiful and comfortable. Despite the Main Street pedestrian and auto traffic, it was quiet inside. The shower is great, and bathroom and room are modern and tastefully decorated. We dined at the restaurant- very good for breakfast, ok/ convenient for dinner. We went to Mint in the evening- great drink menu and service. Liga was professional and helpful. I would return.",5,2022,07,05
202,Stephen -Head commissionaire is the face of the Westin!,"Just returned home from anther wonderful stay at the Westin I have stayed at the Westin many times over the last 10 years and whilst the staff are always friendly, helpful and very accommodating there is one Person that stands out and that is Stephen Quirke. He always has a smile on his face and is happy to see us as returning customers. He makes us feel so welcome and makes sure we have everything we need on a daily basis. Nothing is too much trouble and he goes out of his way to make our stay as perfect as it can be, He lets us know how grateful the Hotel is for us repeatedly returning and makes us feel special. ( which i have never actually heard that from anyone else in the hotel ) You would think it was his hotel the way he takes care of all the guests- we were talking with other guests in the Mint bar about how wonderful Stephen and Alan are - they are a deciding factor when we book the Westin as the prices have gone up- but to be taken care of the way Stephen does EVERY tome we come back- its worth it. THANK YOU Stephen from the bottom of my heart. I hope the hotel apricate you as much as Myself and the other guests do. Heather & I keep coming back to see you x",5,2022,07,04
202,Nowhere near a 5 Star,Booked Dinner B & B they said I booked room only told me to show them proof staff very rude. I eventually found original confirmation not even a sorry. Room cluttered with furniture  ceiling in shower moldy and peeling air vent in room filthy Dinner came with champagne or cocktail only offered Prosecco. Still waiting for my tea for breakfast. Room 337,1,2022,07,03
202,Worth the money,Dublin is out of control with hotel prices but I was happy to pay our at the westin hotel. Stayed in Dublin for pride and the westin was the perfect location. Friendly staff and everything in place. The room was a little worn but was told on checkout it is the next to be redecorated so I‚Äôm sure will bring it up to standards. I will stay here again when in Dublin.,5,2022,06,30
202,Needs to be rated a 3,First this is not a 5 star.   We had 2 rooms one with a small loft.  That one shower was absolutely disgusting.  Other room had 2 beds.  This one for 3 days had a westin sticker on the bathroom floor.  We Had to request towels as had just 2.  Finally body soap was never filled during our 3 night stay. Luckily we brought our own.  Don't purchase breakfast as restaurant and hotel are not om the same page and each day subjected to having to go to the front desk to ensure not billed ,2,2022,06,27
202,All 10s,"Great location, beautiful Heritage room, Moreland's Grill has great food, Mint bar has great bank vault vibe, Concierge staff, doormen, and bellmen were top notch.  Nice job Colon with training your staff.  Everything was so pleasant and perfectly executed.",5,2022,06,27
202,Stay,Wonderful stay at the westin dublin. We booked one of their newly refurbished heritage rooms and it was beautiful. Really quiet and comfortable. We had some issues with the shower draining that were never really resolved but staff were apologetic and did their best. All staff we met were really friendly and helpful.,5,2022,06,25
202,In the heart of the city,"Beautiful hotel in the heart of Dublin City. We stayed here in January for a night away and really enjoyed the 5 star treatment. Rooms are stunning, spacious, immaculate and really comfortable. The bathroom is well maintained with lots of vintage features but yet a really great shower. The staff are all super helpful and friendly. Breakfast was absolutely gorgeous we really had an amazing night away min the heart of our city.",5,2022,06,24
202,Afternoon Tea,"We booked afternoon tea after a recommendation and so glad we did. 
Arrived to the westin and very pleasantly surprised with the interior. The lobby was beautifully open and calm with friendly staff welcoming guests. 
The lounge for tea is beautifully appointed and the perfect setting. Service was efficient but not overbearing. The food was very good and everyone in our party enjoyed. Perhaps a little too much food, I‚Äôd hate to see it wasted!! Also had a delicious molly malone cocktail which is a playful spin on an espresso martini - Delish! 
I would recommend afternoon tea at the westin.",5,2022,06,19
202,Horrible sound proofing and Worst customer service ever,"Booked the Westin for the last night of our trip in Ireland, planning on getting a good night sleep before the long flight back to the states.  Ha!

Despite being a platinum member they put us (family of 4 with two young kids) in a room right above their wedding venue - we could hear every word of every song all night.

When we complained, all they said is that they would ask the dj to turn it down, but that it was tough to control.  So much for sleep for us‚Ä¶

For paying more than $500 a night, I would expect much better, both in terms of customer service and treatment of loyal members.

Greatly disappointed.",1,2022,06,18
202,Wished I didn‚Äôt have to leave!,"I never write reviews of hotels as a seasoned traveller but felt the need to share my thoughts about the Westin Dublin. 
Amazing stay from start to finish and a staff trying their best. During my time I noticed a lot of young staff in training and kudos to them on a job well done. Yes there was some communication barriers at times but everyone I encountered was a superstar in their own way!! 
My room was on the 5th floor and was everything you‚Äôd expect from a 5* hotel - although I found it a little stuffy at night. Location can‚Äôt be beat as we headed out dinner with in walking distance. Always a cheery smile from the Doormen no matter the time. Although I didn‚Äôt dine in the hotel I‚Äôm already planning an afternoon tea with family as it looked stunning in the atrium lounge. Thank you to the Westin For a wonderful stay and well done to management and staff. Looking forward to returning already.",5,2022,06,17
202,Perfect Stay!,"The hotel was perfect. Wonderful location, very stylish interior and very efficient and friendly staff. I would totally recommend this hotel and will stay here again next time I visit Dublin. Thank you team for a wonderful stay!",5,2022,06,16
202,Outstanding Radiology Conference,Thank you to Eilish Kealy and her outstanding team at the Westin Dublin for providing 5 star service to our conference delegates during our recent 3 day radiology meeting. The entire team were responsive  to all our requests. The Mint Bar was an  intimate venue for our opening reception and the Banking Hall a perfect setting for our scientific program.,5,2022,06,16
202,Amazing night away,"From the moment we walked through the front doors what an excellent experience. The reception staff very welcoming and accommodating to our request.

Room was very spacious and the bed very comfortable, we had a drink before dinner in the bar then headed to the restaurant. Breakfast next more was delicious. 

On checkout again the staff thanked us for staying and we‚Äôre truly interested about our stay and what we got up to. 

5star customer service, rooms and food. 

Can‚Äôt want to come back again",5,2022,06,14
202,First Time ‚Ä¶ won‚Äôt be the last!,A truly beautiful hotel in the best possible location in Dublin. From the moment we arrived to the moment we left we were so well taken care of. All of the staff went above and beyond for our stay. Spotlessly clean rooms with lovely amenities. Dinner in Morelands Grill was great. Breakfast was also excellent and the best pancakes Iv had in Dublin. If your lucky enough to have the opportunity I highly recommend the Westin Dublin!,5,2022,06,14
202,Superb in every dimension,"The Westin surpassed all expectations. The location is unbeatable, the rooms are extraordinarily luxurious, the food is great (and there are seats available in the restaurant), and David at the concierge station was extremely helpful and friendly. If we had another few days in Dublin (and I wish we did), we‚Äôd spend them at the Westin.",5,2022,06,13
202,A reluctant review of a poor hotel,"I have considered whether or not to post a review. So in fairness to other travellers I will. 

I paid for a deluxe King which stated would have 'stunning views of Dublin City or Trinity College'. A minibar also. 

I arrived to genuine shock (pics included). View out of the tiny window was of roof tiles as you can see literally obscuring all light. Horrid rusting around base of shower. Minibar to be seen to be believed (pic shown). Carpet from the dark ages. 

I asked to be moved and I was. A bit better but so outdated. I enclose the picture of the minibar and carpet.

I wrote to the room manager who seemed receptive and emailed to say I had been allocated an old room but would be happy to 'offer me a complimentary upgrade to a renovated room'. Bear in mind I was paying ‚Ç¨600 a night. Why give me a room initially that was so patently horrendous. 

I was happy until time to pay the bill, more than double  expected. The receptionist said it was correct. She itemised it, they will billing me for a night that was being paid by Marriott envoy points. And the kicker, an extra ‚Ç¨120 for the 'complimentary' upgrade. 

I was clearly angry and asked to speak to the manager. 

She said she would not deal with me unless I changed my attitude and tone. Of course I was upset. I was triggered by that stage. I put a sock in my mouth to ensure I was not charged for this. 

First they put in a room which was such a disgrace and misrepresentation of what I paid (a fortune), and then to be charged when one night was on points, and then to charge me for a 'complimentary upgrade'

I would have given 1 star, but 3 stars as the renovated room on the 2nd night was nice although very small. And the manager did offer me a renovated room albeit then tried to charge me. 

Honestly this is not a 5 star hotel, and cannot justify ‚Ç¨600 a night. Not in a million years.",3,2022,06,11
202,Central location,"I‚Äôm a loyal Bonvoy Ambassador member so stay in marriotts whenever i can

Booked for 3 night stay and when my flight changed, it should be 2 nights which i completely forgot. The front desk didn‚Äôt say anything upon check in and i realised the error in the middle of my stay

Good location, near Trinity college, Temple bar street and restaurants/cafes/shops

Hotel and suite were ok, though oldish. The porter didn‚Äôt bring my luggages to my room, i did them myself. And they have silly steps along the corridor, why not slopes instead for luggages

There was also a gross hairball on the bathroom wall

Limited tv channels, mainly british 

Gym was oldish with no windows

Generally nice staff, especially the trainees at the main door",4,2022,06,11
202,"No views, drab beige room","Gives off a prison cell vibe, claustrophobic 
Faces in inner courtyard and a wall. Called to try to get an alternate room and was told that even though it‚Äôs 9 in the morning all of the rooms were ‚Äòassigned‚Äô already and I couldn‚Äôt be switched. Even though I had paid for an extra night last night and was willing to wait until the rooms turn today effectively throwing $500 away‚Ä¶
+1 star for good location",2,2022,06,11
202,Made me hate Dublin -- easily worst Westin!,"I don't normally leave reviews, but this was bad enough that I thought it was important to do so. We stayed at the Dublin Westin in early June (2022) for two days. Long story short, I would not recommend staying here. It made me hate Dublin. And dear god, definitely do not book this location via any 3rd party service.

It was easily the worst hotel we stayed at for our full 12 day trip. There were so many issues. The air conditioning in the room we paid for was broken, and for whatever reason, the room was uncomfortably hot (and I run cold), despite the cool weather. Even the hotel representative admitted it was uncomfortable. The only other room available was a significant downgrade. Please note: I noticed that the air-conditioning was not working in the new room either, but for whatever reason the temperature in the downgraded room was fine, so... fine, it's all fine. However, the front desk would not reimburse us for the downgraded room without first getting approval with the reservation staff, who only work 9-5 pm... you know, the time you typically want to be out exploring the city but now have to cut into your vacation to deal with issues. This was partly complicated because we booked through a 3rd party service (Chase rewards). The front desk staff said they could not make any changes to the reservation without first going through our 3rd party vendor. They did not offer any other consolation for the downgrade (free breakfast, maybe???), other than a generic shrug.

So we called our American 3rd party vendor (from Ireland) who then called the front desk staff 4 floors downstairs from us (in Ireland), who then transferred them to the same reservation agents (in Ireland), who never answered. We tried again the next day--same result. We tried emailing the reservation agents directly--no response. It's now been a week, and we still have not heard anything from anyone. Super.

In addition to this blatant theft, we had a bunch of other, smaller, frankly stupid issues, that otherwise I would not bother posting about. The downgraded room was gross. I'll try and attach a photo, but the grout in the bathroom was all orange and mildewy. We had the hotel launder our clothes, and they lost an item. One of the cleaning staff decided to use our room to make a cup of coffee, and left their dirty cup, as well as a mess of water. Also, the other ""clean"" cup had gross stains in it. The gym had limited equipment.

Pro: Location and concierge service was good.",1,2022,06,10
202,Housekeeping is an Issue.,"Nice hotel. Unfortunately, only the lower two floors have been renovated? One side faces Medley, a noisy nightclub. The hotel kindly moved me away from this after the first night. Bar and restaurant were delicious. Decor was nice. Housekeeping was truly the problem. One night they tried entering at 9:15 pm. One day they didn‚Äôt come at all. I had a giant hairball in my bathroom, and the floors generally weren‚Äôt clean. Not reassuring as we emerge from a pandemic and definitely not on point for nearly ‚Ç¨500/night! I‚Äôve been noticing this as a disturbing trend and SPG/Bonvoy properties from San Diego to Arizona to Ireland.",3,2022,05,31
202,"Fantastic location, very nice hotel","We loved the location of this hotel, right across from Trinity college and close to Grafton Street, O'Connell Street, shopping, and dining. The hotel was very pretty inside and felt upscale. Our room was huge in comparison to others we had stayed at in and was very comfortable and nicely appointed. The bathroom was great and had a big shower. The AC didn't work well, so the first night my husband couldn't sleep. They fixed it the next day but it still took awhile to cool the room down. Also our room was not cleaned on our last day, despite us leaving early and being out of the hotel for over 10 hrs. We told the front desk when we went to dinner and it was cleaned by the time we came back. We opted to add the daily breakfast to our stay which worked out well; we had little to no wait times, comfortable seating, and lots of options in the buffet, plus you can special order certain dishes, like omelets and Eggs Benedict. I would definitely stay here again on a future stay.",5,2022,05,30
202,5 star prices but not 5 star service,"We stayed in the Westin hotel on Saturday night, first time we had booked this hotel & we were looking forward staying at the hotel, but  left very disappointed.
We arrived at 4pm & were told our room wasn‚Äôt ready at 5pm we still hadn‚Äôt got a call saying our room was ready. ( we had a dinner reservation for 6pm ) I went back to reception where we eventually got our room key.
The receptionist said our luggage was in our room. Met the concierge, he said luggage was on its way, 20 minutes later still no luggage.
Couldn‚Äôt ring reception to find out where our luggage was as the phone wasn‚Äôt working. Went down to reception and eventually found our luggage. So at 5.25pm we were sorted.
Told the guys at reception that the phone & tv were not working, they said maintenance would fix this, they didn‚Äôt.
Would have loved to write a good review but if you charge over ‚Ç¨600 for a night & you get the level of service we got then sorry I can‚Äôt write a good review.",2,2022,05,30
202,"Excellent service, wonderful staff, stunning room","I was here for a work event and I couldn‚Äôt have had a more enjoyable evening here. The staff were unbelievably kind and the food was delicious. Big shout out to Ines, Conor, Sam, and Felipe!! They are a credit to the Westin!",5,2022,05,28
202,Excellent property and service!,"We stayed at the Dublin Westin for 5 nights and were very happy with the property (beautiful!) and the service (Alan at the Concierge desk is incredibly friendly, knowledgable and helpful!) as well as the front desk staff and the restaurant team. The only part that was a bit disappointing was that the 2 treadmills and 1 elliptical were not operational but they said they were having people come in and fix it.  The hotel is located in an excellent area not only in proximity to attractions but also the surrounding area. Wonderful!",5,2022,05,28
202,"Nice, well-located hotel (buffet was lacking)","During a recent trip to Dublin I stayed here for 2 and 3 nights at the front and end of the trip.  It is the safe choice for a Westin and as usual, it's a nice property with a friendly staff.   The location was also good for walking to Temple Bar (food) and the Convention Center (meetings).

My room was clean both times and I'm especially a fan of a strong, hot shower after a full day walking the city.  The gym was OK, but lacked a Peloton, which I enjoy in many Westins.

Two things to be wary of:
Breakfast buffet - The restaurant staff struggled nearly everyday to turn the tables and get people seated.  There was usually a line and you could see unbussed tables.  it's not like most Westins where you can just walk in and get seated.  Second, the fruit selection was really bad, so if you don't want the traditional Irish stuff on the buffet (or eggs, which i don't eat), you're eating waffles (super yummy) and breads.  This was a let down

The wifi is crazy slow - I tried to take a few zoom calls from my room in the middle of the day and I had to use VoIP to essentially go audio-only.  If you plan on working from your room on zoom, be warned.

All in all, this is a good hotel.  I'd stay when i'm back in town. for sure.",4,2022,05,27
202,Get it together Westin!!!,"Every person on staff was courteous and seemed helpful, but nothing ever got taken care of. When we arrived in room, there was only one set of towels and two bath mats. We called and asked for more towels, but none ever arrived. I nabbed a few off a housekeeping cart myself. We had two large suitcases. We put one up on a desk, but needed a luggage rack for the other. I‚Äôm too old these days to work off of a suitcase on the floor. Called and asked for one. They had me check the closet (which I had already done). And no, there still wasn‚Äôt one in the room. I waited to get in shower as didn‚Äôt want them coming in then and didn‚Äôt want to miss them. No worries, no one ever showed up. My husband was coming up from the lobby when he spotted an open closet with a rack in it. He found a guy to ask about it and he brought it in. It was dusty and beat up, but worked fine. Our sink did not drain and we called about that. Don‚Äôt know if anyone every came and worked on it, but every time we used the sink we had to leave the room with it filled with soap scum and water hoping it would drain before we needed to use it again. The next night the shower pan filled with water to almost over-flowing in my shower and did overflow when my husband took his. We never did get new towels, so had to leave a pile of sopping wet towels in the corner on bathroom floor, not my usual way of doing things. The one window in the room was filthy and unpleasant to look out of. The bed and bedding however, were comfortable and the room had been updated with new carpet and furnishings, so there‚Äôs that. Also, great location in the city for sightseeing, etc.",2,2022,05,25
202,Good room - sloppy housekeeping,"The positives:
-	Nice room
-	Friendly staff.

The negatives:
-	No menu or breakfast order forms in the room 
-	No robes (though hangers indicating they should be there)
-	Room not cleaned, dirty coffee cup and coffee pot found on return at night
-	Wastepaper baskets not cleared
-	No coffee or milk refilled after use
-	No shampoo ‚Äì but two shower gels in the shower
-	Coffee machine stopped working ‚Äì likely due to many guests‚Äô pods ‚Äì but unable to fix it. No morning coffee
-	Wait for breakfast of 5 minutes. Large tables available but not offered as I was ‚Äúonly one person‚Äù.

Not really a great standard ‚Äì sorry Westin Dublin ‚Äì it‚Äôs a no from me.",2,2022,05,25
202,Worst night sleep ever,"For many guests this hotel will be just fine as most of the rooms face Trinity College and are quite quiet but some rooms aren't as lucky.... mine was one floor above a bar that was rocking it until 1:00 a.m. I don't really know what the hotel could do to fix it but they shouldn't be giving out rooms where people can't sleep. My flight the next morning was at 7:00 a.m. so needless to say I didn't sleep much  We only stayed here one night thankfully. We had stayed elsewhere for the majority of our trip. It was definitely a sad end to the trip and one I'm trying to put out of my mind. 

When I complained to the hotel reception they knew exactly what I was talking about and when you Google you can see people making comments about the noise for many years. But the hotel in their email to me tried to suggest that this was the first they'd ever heard of it and that they've "" noted that I prefer a quiet room"" which is beyond ridiculous.  

The hotel could easily solve their problem by asking people at check-in if they would like a room that's a bit noisy that comes with some free drink coupons. The place across the street isn't always open so they can easily get their schedule. Or they can just keep acting like they've never heard of it every time someone complains like they've been doing the last 5 years.",2,2022,05,25
202,Perfect location,"The location as others have noted, is incredibly convenient.  I stayed in a junior suite, and I was very happy with the layout.  The sleeping area is windowless, so my sleep quality was great.  The staff is really friendly.  I'll stay here again.",5,2022,05,21
202,Afternoon delight,"We had afternoon tea in the atrium as a birthday treat for my nana. 
Laura our server was fantastic and so accommodating when I asked to swap a few of the items on the menu. She was attentive topping us up with Tea & Coffee throughout the afternoon !

The atmosphere and setting in the atrium was gorgeous and the perfect mid week birthday treat !",5,2022,05,17
202,Well worth a stay!!,This place is obviously newly renovated. Everything smells new and is so clean and fresh. Staff is super helpful and kind. Lobby is beautiful. Also offers several different eating establishments such as the Atrium that offers delicious afternoon tea. One of the nicer places we‚Äôve stayed!,5,2022,05,14
202,Unbeatable Location,"Best points about the hotel are the unbeatable location, comfortable bed, heavenly shower, Morelands Grill for breakfast and dinner, front desk and concierge. Note the Heritage Deluxe rooms in the recently opened wing don‚Äôt have city views and the website hasn‚Äôt been updated yet to reflect this fact. Queried it with a manager who assured us we were in the right room but did offer to find us one with a view. In the event we were content to stay where we were - its just that when we found we were in an inner cabin it made us think we were in the wrong place. So we had the nice blue carpet but no artwork, no bathrobes/slippers, and initially no tea mugs. Only one USB port in the room next to one side of the bed so if you have two devices bring a plug. No dressing table so my wife used the mirror above the minibar for hair drying. Room servicing was inconsistent (small details) but we understand that all hotels are short of staff at present. However on one day it was disheartening to return from a tiring day trip to find the room was unmade. At ‚Ç¨700 a night everything should be just right.

Again we do recommend Morelands Grill for dinner. We booked it separately as a stop-gap before eating out elsewhere and are delighted that we did so.",4,2022,05,14
202,Friendliest Staff Ever,"Perfect location in central Dublin and easy to get to from the airport on public transportation.  Super friendly staff and concierge.  Clean, quiet, comfortable.  Breakfast was excellent and kept us going all day.  Walking distance to pretty much everything on the tourist trail.",5,2022,05,10
202,"Stay at the Westin,","Outstanding stay at the Westin Dublin,
Everything from the moment we arrived to our departure could not have been better.
Staff were very helpful.
Rooms were spotless. 
And breakfast was fabulous  . The location is very central , which is great as Dublin is a wonderful city to walk around.",5,2022,05,07
202,Great Location,"The Westin Dublin is in a great location to explore Ireland.  
The rooms are super comfortable, the staff is very friendly (as were all the people in Ireland!) and overall, the entire hotel was clean.
My only piece of advice is to carefully select your room.  We had an early check in but no rooms were available.  They offered us a room that was ready but had a ""slightly obstructed view"" but that we could switch to a better room the next day.  We took it because we were exhausted.  Our ""view"" was of a peaked roof with just a sliver of sky showing.  We were able to move rooms, but it took quite a bit of cajoling.  Our room looking out over the street was so much better!  Of course, a bit noisy, but that's what ear plugs are for!!",4,2022,05,07
202,Dublin trip,"Great visit. Sean was extraordinary. She made our visit very special. The location cannot be beat. My wife and I loved looking out our windows on Westmoreland Street. Housekeeping did a super job as well, though we had to request service. 

Disappointed there is no club lounge. The vast majority of Marriott properties will provide you breakfast, even if it is continental if you are a Titanium member. However, this hotel would not. 

Instead, I was given the choice of points or breakfast, which is a separate Marriott benefit from the club lounge. They said because I was in Europe I could not get the breakfast since they had no club lounge. However, we have stayed in Brussels, Amsterdam, London, Zurich, Tenerife, and Paris. This was the first time breakfast was not automatic when a hotel did not have a club lounge. 

On our city tour we booked, the driver pointed out The Shelbourne Hotel as the place to stay in Dublin. It is also a Marriott property and we may stay there next time.  However, as long as Sean is at the Westin Dublin it will be our go to hotel when visiting Ireland.  

Finally, Morgan Doyle was a huge help. When we were trying to leave to go to the airport, the Bellman could not find us a taxi.  Morgan stepped up and gave us a delightful trip to the airport. He knows so much about Dublin. If we come again, we will try to book a private tour with him.",5,2022,05,03
202,Great location ,"Usually stay at The Merrion for work trips but this time decided to try The Westin.  Had an early check in,  room was good,  over looking The atrium. Didn't eat at the hotel as there are so many places close by. 

Staff were friendly,  although nobody on the desk when checking out, but I was the only one so at least not such a big deal

Gave my email at check in,  but asked twice again when checking out as I needed the receipt. Still didn't receive it,  went back later to pick up my luggage and it was sent then. 
",4,2022,05,03
202,"Amazing stay, stunning rooms","My partner and I stayed at this hotel and there was nothing to fault. A major well done to the accommodation staff that are very clearly professionals that take pride in their work, top to bottom the room was spotless and beautifully presented. Not even a speck of dust or a smudge on a mirror to be seen. The little details in the room make a difference‚Ä¶ there was some calming oil beside the bed, the AC system is idiot proof, USB ports beside each side of the bed, an alarm clock (which actually did go off randomly at 6am but I‚Äôm going to blame the previous guests for this) and separate shampoos and conditioners (my hair thanks you). The shower I wanted to bring home with us. Perfect water pressure and loads of space. Someone had very clearly thought through the full guest experience. 
The staff are very friendly and helpful, especially the breakfast staff and Thomas on reception who I think may have gone to the Middle East in search of some cordial for us, but we appreciated his determination. 
The hotel itself is extremely well maintained and a nice mixture of modern but also making the most of the gorgeous old building. There‚Äôs also a very nice perfume that they use throughout reception. 
A really nice variety of options at breakfast, the fresh honey still on the comb was a particularly nice touch. 
Overall it is a bit pricey but you are getting what you pay for. Attention to detail, beautifully presented in a perfect location. Would definitely recommend if you want a touch of luxury.",5,2022,05,02
202,all good except the room,"Fabulous location in easy walking distance to Trinity College & all kinds of shops, restaurants, pubs and sites.

Very friendly & helpful staff. Excellent daily breakfast option. Rather expensive but lovely afternoon tea service. 

They have a nice ""family plan"" (with a discount on the second room) but for some odd reason you don't qualify as a ""family"" if your children are over age 12. It seems to me that a family of 4 is a family of 4 - regardless if the 2 children are 10 or 15 - but since our 2 were teens we did not qualify so were not eligible.

We booked our 2 rooms far in advance in order to ensure the best specific room type to maximize space.

Upon arrival after a long overnight flight one of the 2 rooms was ready. It absolutely reeked of smoke but we were so eager for a shower that we popped open a window and took off in search of food - hopeful that it would be better upon our return. 

When we returned later that evening we got our second room (no problem with that one) but the smoke smell in the first was still overpowering. There was no way that the housekeeping staff was not aware of this smoke issue - I don't understand why we were not advised of it before dragging our belongings to it to begin with. We called the front desk and were told they were full but could move us the next day. So we spent one very unpleasant night (my husband has asthma so is particularly sensitive to this issue) in this room.

The next morning we called to ask when we would be moving. The clerk seemed confused (no record of the prior night conversation?) but said she would call back. She never did. So we took off for our day. Around 3pm we went in person to the front desk to ask again. That clerk also seemed confused & left for a lengthy ""check with a colleague"" as if she had no idea this was supposed to be happening. The colleague emerged & confirmed that we would be moving but indicated they needed more time ""to be sure there was no smoke issue"" in the new room. OK....he said he would call us when it was ready. We then waited in the smoke room for almost 2 hours more - still no call, I called AGAIN and indicated that we were a bit annoyed by waiting around all day to move and was finally told that someone would bring us the new key shortly (another 1/2 hour). The whole thing was handled very poorly - why not just tell us from the start when to expect to move? Why not call back when you say you will? 

So we packed up all our stuff and moved to the new room...it was easily 1/2 the size of the first one exacerbated by architectural eaves of the building jutting into the space. Smaller bed space, closet, bathroom, everything. It was clearly meant for 1 person - not 2 - which seemed obvious by only one bathrobe and space for 1 person to hang their clothes. In order to walk form one side of the bed to the bathroom or sit at the desk one had to move aside furniture bumping into it. It was awful and had we known what a space downgrade it was we would have likely just stayed put with the smoke.

It really was such a shame. An otherwise lovely stay at a beautiful property marred by  
this room assignment. And an utterly botched move to a downgraded uncomfortable  room which wasted a good part of our short time in Dublin.",3,2022,04,24
202,Great location and phenomenal service,"The location of this hotel was great.  Short walk to Temple Bar, Trinity College, north of the river attractions.  We did  a couple of day trips and the bus pickups were within a 5 minute walk or less.  The breakfast was awesome everyday and the service was tremendous.  The room was always spotless and we enjoyed the nightly turn down service.  Everyone at the hotel from the front desk, the concierge, the doormen were so nice and helpful.  A truly memorable experience.",5,2022,04,18

202,Alan the Bellman/Concierge!,"We were here for one night visiting our daughter who is studying in Ireland. We were incredibly impressed with Alan, the Bellman/Concierge (he truly did both jobs so well), who went out of his way to give us tips and tricks and insider information on the best way to maximize our time. The best part was he also spent tons of time giving our daughter advice and recommendations on how to find the best spots for the Rugby and general overall advice on living in the Dublin area.  This is the type of person that every hotel should have greeting guests upon their arrival and departure. Such a warm and helpful man, a true credit to the property and the country in general. We are actually going to book another visit to stop in and say hello and make sure he knows what an impact he made.  As nice as our stay was (as it was lovely), Alan is what/who stands out the most. People do make all the difference.",5,2022,04,01
202,St Patrick's Day Stay,My wife and I stayed at the Westin for a St Patrick's Day holiday.  The parade ran right in front of the hotel.  Restaurants in the Westin are great.  Service is wonderful and the staff couldn't be nicer.  Step out front and take a left and walk two blocks to Grafton St. St Stephen's Green is also an easy walk.  Overall our stay was very enjoyable.,5,2022,03,24
202,An oasis in the heart of Dublin,"This is a classically beautiful hotel in the absolute best location in Dublin.  The service was better than any 5 star hotel I‚Äôve stayed at.  The staff was extremely helpful and friendly.  I can‚Äôt praise them enough.  We were a group of 8 that stayed 4 nights over St Patrick‚Äôs Day and this hotel had great energy, but offered a sophistication that complimented our time in Dublin perfectly.",5,2022,03,23
202,Restful and lovely stay,"I read some comments regarding inside facing rooms, and the lack of access to natural light. I ended up with room 405, facing the inside courtyard. 
 
Much to my surprise, I had a lovely stay. This room is quiet, great ventilation, and I did not experience any problems with humidity and odour. I had a very good rest. The Westin heavenly bed certainly helped!

The location is central and convenient, with shopping, eating and sightseeing just steps away. I really do not need a view in my room to enjoy Dublin. 

Problems do occur, I had some minor issues with housekeeping and an offsite fitness facility (temporary). The GM Eamonn took care of it all. Both the property and the staff deserve the 5 star rating!

I had breakfast at the hotel one morning. Food is great and the service far exceeded my expectations.

I had a wonderful time at the Westin Dublin.",5,2022,03,21
202,Excellent staff providing great service!,"Excellent breakfast spread and great staff; Simmone, a gentleman from Naples working at the Westin, provided excellent service and was exceedingly accommodating. While the Irish Bacon was a bit saltier than I had expected, the fresh honeycomb and croissants more than made up for it.

Over-all the staff has been incredibly accommodating. Shauna from reception was very helpful in finding me a new room after it was discovered that there was an issue with a rain gutter over my original room. Likewise, the concierge that helped me move rooms was very friendly and informative throughout my stay.

202,Very Impressed,"My husband and I came here last weekend as a last break before our newborn  twins arrive next month. 
The young man on reception was extremely friendly and helpful which makes a big difference from some recent hotels I have been in. 
The hotel itself is beautiful and the location is ideal.

Unfortunately , after only a few hours of checking in we got a one call that our daughter was taken to hospital in Drogheda. We were in a total panic as we had no car with us  and were unsure if a taxi would take us so far outside the city.
Once again, the reception staff and the Concierge were amazing. By the time we had ran up to the room to grab our case , a lovely taxi man was outside the hotel waiting for us. I can't thank them enough as they made such a stressful  situation so much easier.

To top it off  my husband spoke to the manager a few days later whom offered us a discount and upgrade if we book again - That is 5 star service.",5,2022,03,09
202,Disgusted and Disappointed,"The hotel is nice the staff are great but I'm coming on because I'm outraged. We stayed recently and always at least once a year with my daughter, and we witnessed an influencer (if that's what they actually are) staying for free! I'm outraged, my daughter pointed it out to me, and then just a week after our stay she informed me that another TWO in the same week have stayed for free since! I'm absolutely disgusted. This kind of low grade tactic isn't what I'd expect from a 5 star Hotel, its so cheap. And its adding absolute insult to all those staying and paying top price for the luxury, whilst nobody's get it for free, regularly. It removes all levels of class and value of the property, I precieve it in a different light now having seen this, as I'm sure the influencers people will too. It would be much more worth your while investing in your guests, service and loyalty, esp as our reception at the hotel wasnt exactly 5 star either. Something I'd expect from a 3 or 4 star. I really am just disappointed, as it was somewhere I used to think was a proper 5 star.",2,2022,03,01
202,Crown Jewel in the centre of Dublin,"The Westin is truly a crown jewel in the centre of Dublin. Incredible location. This hotel is truly 5 star. The staff were unbelievably accommodating allowing us to check in much earlier than we had anticipated. The hotel was immaculate.

The quality of the food was exceptional in the restaurant. We particularly loved the Atrium lounge which was really boujee and had real character, the Piano only added to the appeal. We missed afternoon tea but the young waitress Jamila went out of her way to fetch us some scones with hot chocolate despite the restaurant being closed, she really went the extra mile and is an absolute credit to the Hotel.

If this hotel had a swimming pool, sauna & Jacuzzi it would rank amongst the top hotels in the world.

The rooms were spacious and nicely laid out, spotless, and comfortable--as one would expect at a Westin. The building itself, also impressive and perfectly located close to pretty much everything in central Dublin. However, as a Bonvoy Gold Elite member (no ""thank you"" at check-in) and from my numerous experiences at Marriott properties in general, The Westin Dublin fell a bit short. I don't know if they were understaffed during our stay (there was a wedding), but the overall lack of friendliness and help from the sparse staff was surprising. There was one night we arrived home around 11pm and had to wait for sometime after continuously ringing the bell for someone to let us in. That said, I would return as I am a fan of The Westin product and would assume the level of service received is not the usual.",4,2022,02,10

Morelands grill in the hotel was our venue for dinner as part of our package. Simone, Sean, and Emilio looked after us attentively with pre dinner drink and efficient service throughout the evening. Although at the tail end of the menu, the Carnaroli Risotto with wild mushrooms was an exceptional dish for both of us. On a quiet night for the kitchen the ability to maintain a high standard was obvious. ",5,2022,01,25

202,Great room and dinner at Westmoreland grill,"Very nice restaurant staff and excellent service throughout. 
Great food in Westmoreland grill.
Some confusion about voucher and payment in advance when checking in. Was resolved the next morning. 
Very central location close to the main city attractions. ",4,2022,01,24
202,Fantastic stay and outstanding service at the Westin Dublin,"I just returned from a two-night stay at the Westin Dublin. Honestly it could not have been better! My room was just gorgeous‚Äî-clean, spacious, and contemporary‚Äî and ready on arrival. This was so exciting because I had just come in from the States and made use of it!

The location was tremendous. Right next to Trinity and an easy walk to Temple Bar, O‚ÄôConnell Street, and public transportation. It was well lit and safe; and indoors had that welcoming Westin smell. üôÇThe restaurants were spot on including a cozy bar / tea area with a fireplace (perfect after curfew) and a beautiful basement bar as well. Breakfast was divine. Ample and delicious food and the service was outstanding. I felt like a princess!

The service at this hotel is stellar. Everyone made us feel welcome at all times and went above and beyond. When I returned home, I realized that something important was left in my room safe. Shawn and Seana at the front desk worked with me to retrieve it, and posted it to the States the next day. Simply amazing.

I will be staying here again on my next trip to Dublin. Worth every penny!",5,2022,01,21
202,Wonderful Winter Weekend at the Westin Dublin,"Great city centre location, superb facilities and amenities and most important of all 
fantastic people there who made our stay feel  that we were among friends that were attentive and helpful to us at all times. The Afternoon Tea was especially enjoyable",5,2021,12,31
202,Luxurious Christmas,"Christmas at Westin what can I say only that it was stunning. Arrival on Christmas Eve to warm mince pies by the fire and our stunning Heritage Deluxe Junior Suite. Love these rooms as our favourite room the library suite was undergoing renovation. The staff can‚Äôt be more welcoming and helpful. I‚Äôve one suggestion for the hotel to make things better. In room media is very poor we asked for an hdmi cable which the concierge found for us. The TV Chanel‚Äôs are poor and half don‚Äôt work. When it‚Äôs Christmas you just want to snuggle up and watch movies and order room service. 

Christmas Eve dinner was excellent and food was beautiful.

Christmas morning we had champagne breakfast followed by Christmas lunch in the banking hall. All I can say is wow what a stunning location for lunch. Served a cold glass of champagne on arrival followed by soup course then our starters and champagne sorbet.

Main course was beautiful also however the meat wasn‚Äôt as hot as I would have liked mentioned this to the staff they spoke to chef it was sorted immediately. 

The staff make this place special the hotel is tastefully decorated and the beds are the best beds out of all the 5* hotels I‚Äôve stayed in. 

This is our favourite hotel in Dublin and will continue to be:

Thank you Westin for our Christmas gift of afternoon tea for two we will be back in the new year to celebrate.

Again to all the staff thank you and Happy New Year!",5,2021,12,30
202,a fabulous stay at the westin,My husband and I had the pleasure of staying here for a wedding before xmas 2021. All I can say is it is a magnificent hotel with beautiful period features especially in th e Banking Hall.     The dining area with the glow from the fireplace and  the xmas tree lit up amid the xmas decor was just majical .   Later  I found a nice snug amid bookshelves and soft lighting to quietly read.     The staff were exceptional and very helpful. Altogether a memorable experience and cant wait to revisit again next year.,5,2021,12,29
202,Christmas Stay 2021,"5/5, all I can see is wow‚Ä¶ we stayed here for Christmas 2021 and I am still speechless at how amazing our experience was.

The staff are so friendly and polite. They honestly couldnt do enough for you. My Granny is in a wheelchair and the kindness they gave to her throughout our stay was amazing.

The food was out of this world.. so freshly cooked. 

We stayed in the Grattan Suite it was perfect!!

Overall I would definitely recommend this hotel,   Not just for Xmas all around the year!! 

Thank you again xx",5,2021,12,27
202,Our truly incredible wedding at The Westin Dublin,"The Westin Dublin was the truly stunning location of our wedding in December 2021, chosen because my now wife and her family enjoyed Afternoon Tea there before her sister emigrated to Australia. Long before I had ever popped the question, her mother had her eye on The Westin and she told a little white lie to get a tour of the venue on the premise that I had indeed popped the question. Even at this stage, the Staff were wonderfully accommodating and gave them the full tour of the beautiful Banking Hall and they were truly blown away.

From the moment we went to view it as a couple in search of that wedding venue, we were greeted with exceptional professionalism and incredible service. The events manager was awaiting our arrival at the door with champagne and canap√©s for us to try before we were taken on the full tour ourselves. The rooms are stunning and the grandeur of them is just breathtaking. This was the venue for us for sure.

Throughout the process of planning the wedding, the level of care was second to none. As our wedding was happening in the midst of the rolling uncertainty of the pandemic, things were changing on a weekly basis but all changes were met with cool heads and constructive solutions throughout. We had a curfew of 12pm imposed by Government restrictions just 3 weeks out from our big day so we had to move our timings on the day forward by 2 hours. This was no problem at all. Then we had our numbers drop by about 35 people but there was never any panic. Rather, the response was cool, calm and collected and incredibly fair in terms of changes to the overall costs, something that was greatly appreciated.

We worked everything out and the big day was upon us. We knew how fabulous the service was as we had enjoyed it in all of our interactions with our events manager. But, in truth, we had not experienced anything yet...

We arrived to The Westin the night before the wedding and met our international guests. From the moment we all arrived, we were greeted with the warmest of welcomes from each and every staff member, all of whom showed great professionalism, care and attention to detail in every exchange. This exceptional service continued throughout the entire weekend. We have never experienced service like it anywhere else in the world and we are truly thankful for it.

The accommodations were fabulous and we could not fault any of it. The rooms were beautiful adorned, elegant and stylish as well as being spotlessly clean, bright and spacious. The Westin sits at the very heart of Dublin and the from the upper floors were stunning too and, as Dubliners ourselves, we adored seeing our beloved hometown from a new viewpoint.

Now, on to the wedding itself...

Well, all I can say is that it was the best day of our lives. Everything came together in the end and we managed to get in just before the restrictions changed again. All the hard work in planning our special day was done and no detail was missed by the staff at The Westin. Everything was just perfect.

The Banking Hall is an incredible room with 40-foot ceilings and incredible period details. It made for a truly breathtaking ceremony as well as the subsequent meal and live music. Our guests were awestruck by the venue as well as everything else!

After the ceremony, we had a drinks reception in The Mint Bar in the basement of the hotel, where the vaults in the part of the hotel that was once a bank. This underground hideaway was a magical space for drinks and canap√©s and the atmosphere was electric. The canap√©s themselves were absolutely delicious and our guests raved about them.

What followed was a genuinely delicious meal upstairs in The Banking Hall. The service was excellent and the room itself had been transformed from theatre-style seating to a dining room with ease by the seasoned staff. Everything was changed over smoothly and things were set for what turned out to be a sensational meal. Our guests, once again, raved about the food, the wine, the service and the exceptional staff. We are still receiving messages with glowing reviews!

Once the dinner and speeches were over, the room was altered once more to allow for our band to come in and set up. Again, this was a seamless process and there were no points in the day where there was a lull. Once the band were set up, they kicked off and our very happy guests danced the entire night away with the dance floor full throughout.

Even after we hit the 12pm curfew, there was a level of calm professionalism that meant things were wound down without there being any feeling of being rushed. People were eased out and our guests left with massive smiles on their faces, bellies full of delicious food and fine drinks and sore feet from all the dancing.

The reviews coming in are that our wedding was the best wedding any of our guests had ever been to. The Westin Dublin was the most incredible venue for our wedding and the staff were instrumental in making it so wonderful. We cannot thank them enough for everything they did for us on our most special weekend.

If you are looking for an exceptional hotel, look no further. And, if you are searching for the perfect wedding venue, then The Westin Dublin is it.

Thank you once more to all the staff. We loved every minute of our stay with you.",5,2021,12,21
202,Visit to Dublin,"Hotel was exceptional standard. The room was small but thoroughly clean and very comfortable. The service was brilliant but the thing that topped it all was the friendliness of the staff. Nothing was a bother, especially the reception staff. We were treated with such dignity, very impressive. 
Definitely a return visit planned.",5,2021,12,16
202,Wonderful Hotel,Fabulous hotel and staff. The decor was gorgeous I just loved it. The room was a Heritage Room and it was stunning and the bathroom was so tastefully decorated. The food in Morelands grill was really excellent and the presentation was outstanding. We had drinks in The Atrium and The Mint and loved both of them. The staff were  all so helpful and obliging. The location is also so central. My only problem was that I am a very light sleeper and I found the traffic noise woke me very early in the morning. I would go for an interior room if visiting again. Overall I really enjoyed my stay and thought the hotel was excellent. Thanks to all of the staff who are working in such difficult times.,4,2021,12,12
202,Excellent Location Even Better Staff,"I stayed here on a mini break on Monday the 6th of December from the moment we checked in the staff couldn't do enough for us , we travelled with our 5 month old son, The reception staff were exceptional they are so professional while yet showing sincere care. upon check in they allowed us check in early to start our visit early, The room was spacious and a lovely few extra touches such as play mat and kids tent really made us feel welcome and cared for . The breakfast the next day was so well presented and organised with yet again the service of all the staff shinning through. We will most defiantly be back for 1 the location but more so the staff and there genuine care.",5,2021,12,10
202,Best Birthday Trip since a long time,"I just recently stayed at the incredible Westin Hotel for 1 week and honestly, it was the best birthday my husband ever gave me. 

I have done advanced check in and all I had to do was just to pick up my room key.  I stayed in a Junior Suite which had a small terrace on the roof and was located in the Georgian style building. The suite was incredible cosy and also levelled. The bed like all Westin Hotels was the Heavenly Bed and I have to say, I literally slept like a baby. 

I had my daily dinner at Morelands Grill and frankly speaking, the food quality was divine. If you didn‚Äôt know what you wanted to eat the friendly and knowledgeable staff would give you a suggestion (I stayed in many Westin Hotels but the service I got in Dublin was impeccable compare to the other Westin Hotels). Well, breakfast to be honestly could be better and have more options to choose from the buffet

If you stay at the Westin or are in Dublin you should have afternoon tea at the Atrium while sitting besides the lovely fireplace (if you like cocktails, try the Lemon Drop Cocktail, delicious).

What I loved about the Hotel is not only the incredible service I got but also the location. You are pretty much right opposite Temple Bar and short walking distances to other sightseeing places. 

All I know is that I definitely will come back but this time with my husband and daughter. I really want to thank the Hotel Manager Eamonn Casey for the lovely welcome gift and also for all the reception staff for making my stay memorable.",5,2021,12,09
202,Westin Stay,"We stayed for one night on a Saturday at the Westin. The hotel is located centrally, which is ideal for getting around Dublin. The lobby area was beautifully decorated for Christmas and the staff on reception were very welcoming and efficient. The room itself was clean but felt it was a bit dated and could do with a revamp. The primary reason for the rating was because of the poor breakfast offering. Breakfast was buffet style and had limited options. There were no sanitising stations at the self service area despite COVID, which felt unsafe. The food itself was also average. You could avail of eggs or pancakes  on order (no menu provided for this told verbally) but it took over 20 minutes for a sever to finally ask if we wanted anything, by which time it was too late. We also had to leave our seats to get staff attention for butter, which wasn‚Äôt on our table. Overall a very poor dining experience.",3,2021,12,05
202,Glad to be back in Dublin and at The Westin,"We love returning to Dublin and, staying at The Westin, our favourite hotel, makes the experience one to remember. The staff are all so warm and friendly and the service is excellent, we appreciate the little touches. We enjoyed a three day break on half board and everything was perfect. In advance of check in, I rang the hotel to say I had recently cricked my neck and wondered whether they had a hot water bottle and flatter pillows I could use whilst there. When I got to the room, which had been upgraded, there waiting on the bed was a new water bottle and just the right pillows. The Mint Bar re-opened on the first night of our stay and we ventured in on our second night. It was so nice to be back there and hopefully in not too many months, it will be buzzing with live music events. Breakfast and dinner in the Morelands Grill was excellent and the waiting staff were so attentive. I knew when I booked the 3 nights half board deal with Expedia at the end of July 2021, I had got it for an exceptional price. I did wonder before checking out whether my final bill would be correct and unfortunately it wasn't. Reservations at the hotel had it down as us having dinner on only the first of the three night stay. However, once I provided a copy of my reservation confirming half board for the duration of the stay, everything was sorted within a matter of minutes with a very helpful member of The Westin's reception team. We look forward to returning to The Westin in the near future.",5,2021,11,30
202,A Wonderful Venue for a Conference,"We were absolutely delighted to hold the inaugural Irish Student Law Journal Conference at the Westin. At every stage of planning, Eilish and the team were brilliant: from communication to execution. 

The venue itself (the Guinea and Florin Suite) was stunning - our reception was hosted here and it was the perfect space. Besides simply being a stunning room, it met all of our AV requirements, and was spacious enough to allow for social distancing. 

The canap√©s and wine were absolutely excellent, as was the service provided by the events team. 

Overall, both our own team and our guests were absolutely delighted with the evening. We would highly recommend the Westin for events!",5,2021,11,26
202,Great hotel in a perfect location,"My wife and I recently stayed at the Westin Dublin, and were highly impressed with the hotel.  The rooms, the staff, and the location all exceeded expectations.  For travelers who want to stay at a great hotel in the very heart of Dublin, I highly recommend the Westin.",5,2021,11,23
202,Amazing experience!,"I don't even know where to start! From the moment you arrive, you understand the meaning of ""WELCOME"". The staff has a 5-star service: The concierge, the receptionists, the portmen, the breakfast employees. Everyone! I am so glad we booked at this property. It is definitely a recommended hotel for couples. The room we had was a bit small but the bathroom was big and beautiful. The views from the room were also lovely. This hotel couldn't have a better location. It is right in the middle of the city center and you can reach everything close to the hotel: Trinity College, the Temple Bar pub, restaurants, bars, grocery shops, everything! I wish we could have stayed longer. We also had dinner and breakfast here. The dinner experience was really good. For the breakfast, there are not many options for people who do not eat pork but it was still enjoyable. Probably the best pancakes we have ever tried :) Overall it was a perfect experience and I would definitely come back here if I visit Dublin again. Thank you!",5,2021,11,22
202,"Don‚Äôt walk here, RUN!!",Me and my girlfriend came here for a quiet Sunday night stayüëåüèΩ Immediately impressed after coming in from the busy city into a very calming/stunning lobby. All reception staff we dealt with were very very kind and welcoming. Our room was so amazing. Bathroom stunning and views of the city were brilliant! We didn‚Äôt have dinner or lunch but the breakfast was really surprising. Most hotel breakfast are more or less the same but this was really really nice and just all round amazing little Sunday away üëåüèΩüòÜ highly recommended to anyone.,5,2021,11,22
202,Incredibly well-situated Dublin Hotel,"My wife and I stayed here for two nights on our way to the UK. Happy to report that everything that a hotel should be, this property was exactly that. Our room, a deluxe double, although not huge by US standards, was most adequate for our needs, complete with a wall safe, a huge bathroom, and a nice view of the Trinity College campus. You can‚Äôt be in a better location for Central Dublin; within about a 15 minute walk, you are virtually near every touristic venue.

Under GM Eamonn Casey, all staff we encountered were helpful and enthusiastic. The buffet breakfast that was offered was tasty and well thought out. Fresh honey and huge cooked mushrooms were an added bonus to the offerings. 

Certainly one of the best hotels I‚Äôve ever stayed at all over the world.",5,2021,11,19
202,Excellent in every way - STAY HERE!!!,"My wife and I came to Dublin for a short weekend getaway from the US (having never been to Ireland before).  We are frequent travelers around the globe and stay at many hotels.  Without doubt, The Westin Dublin was one of the best hotel experiences we've ever had; anywhere.  The location is perfect, the safety protocols are strictly followed, the staff was friendly and helpful and price point is spot on.  Our interactions with every employee (front desk, concierge, Atrium staff, housekeeping, room service and (especially) the doorman were well beyond our expectations.  We can't recommend this hotel emphatically enough.  We would happily fly 4,000 to stay here and can't wait to do so again.",5,2021,11,17
202,Best employees in a very lovely location.,"We had an amazing stay in this lovely hotel with their cordial employees. We felt very comfortable and enjoyed every minute. The afternoon tea is a pleasure experience in a wonderful location and also the restaurant serves excellent food. The special service to borrow sport stuff is very nice. 
We hope to come back very soon Thanks to all who made our stay like this.",5,2021,11,16
202,Top class,"My family and i returned to the westin for the 2nd time on November 12th,our expectations were very high after our last trip,we were blown away with the new make over in the lobby first of all,the staff were kind and courteous from manager right down to bottle washer,such a great atmosphere made our stay actually perfect,of course the hidden gem here is steven at the entrance,what a great character and willing to help out in anyway humanly possible,will definitely be back,only counting down the days to our next visit,wouldn't even consider staying anywhere else only the westin,thanks to all for making our trip an enjoyable one",5,2021,11,16
202,Amazing service,"My son and I spent a day in day in Dublin on Friday and unfortunately missed our bus. We were were awaiting  the last bus to Galway at midnight  and popped into the Westin to grab drinks and to charge our phones in case we might possibly be stuck in Dublin . I wasn't sure that it was ok to do this but I can honestly say the welcome and service was simply excellent . We felt slightly self conscious as we'd been in Dublin all day ,  attended a soccer match so we both looked slightly bedraggled. Despite this , we were treated with friendliness, courtesy and fantastic old fashioned superior service. We will definitely return for an overnight stay in the future. Gorgeous hotel in every way!",5,2021,11,15
202,Excellent hotel,The Westin Dublin exceeded my high expectations for the Westin brand. Alan - the concierge - and Luke have especially made my stay enjoyable. The Christmas decorations are a nice touch - very cheery and festive. The rooms are nicely appointed and quiet. We will return.,5,2021,11,14
202,Stunning Hotel - 5 star experience- Highly recommend!,"Recently stayed in the Westin and as usual had a wonderful weekend! It's just been renovated and looks amazing, the Lobby is modern and luxurious and the rooms are just stunning.

We had an excellent dinner in the hotels 'Morelands Grill' , the staff there are so attentive and friendly and we found that to be the case with every member of staff we met, Eamonn and the team did everything they could to make our stay extra special.

The location is really convenient with the Luas and several buses practically on the doorstep, making it ideal for exploring either side of the Liffey. Will definitely be back- highly recommend!",5,2021,11,12
202,"Amazing weekend, thank you so much","Just spent the weekend here for our 2nd wedding anniversary. It was such an amazing time that we have now decided that this will be how we will celebrate it every year. 

The location is the best for exploring the city, the staff are so lovely, nothing is too much trouble and the cocktails in the Mint bar are fabulous. 

You can tell that the hotel has been recently renovated as everything looks so fresh and immaculate. 

HIGHLY RECOMMEND!",5,2021,11,12
202,Gorgeous room but disappointing service,"Myself and my boyfriend stayed in a deluxe double room recently. While the room itself was gorgeous we were really disappointed in the service. We went for a pre-dinner drink in the Atrium but had to go find someone to take our order as we were waiting quite a while with no one coming to us. 

We had dinner in the Moreland's Grill and again were waiting quite a while for our order to be taken. A manager eventually looked after us and apologised for the delay.

Service in the Atrium after dinner was very slow, we had two drinks in two hours and I had to go looking for the bill as there was no staff nearby. The Guinness was left sitting out far too long and was undrinkable by the time it was brought out.

Our waiter did apologise and said it was his first day, I don't blame him as he was doing his best, but should have been supported with other staff on hand to keep service moving faster.

I believe a wedding was on in the hotel that evening which may have explained the service issues.

Overall disappointed as we'd been looking forward to our stay for months after our previous booking was cancelled due to Covid closures. I won't be rushing back.",3,2021,11,10
202,Wedding,Our son had his wedding here on November 6th. From start to finish everything was fabulous. The staff were exceptional especially the concierge Stephen who went above & beyond his call of duty to help us. Thank you Stephen we really appreciated your kindness & help. The rooms were lovely & the beds were fabulous - we had the best sleeps ever. Stay here & you won‚Äôt be disappointed. A big thank you for making everything perfect.,5,2021,11,09
202,Really loved this place!!,"The hotel was awesome. So conveniently located!!! We had a room on the Mezzanine level and it was lovely. The only thing was it was across the street from a party venue and a couple nights the parties were really loud. 
The staff was top notch. Colm the concierge was really great. Luke and Eamonn at the front desk were so helpful especially with Covid testing.  There was a really nice guy in the restaurant every morning and I didn‚Äôt get his name- but he made us feel welcome the whole week!!!
I cannot stress how awesome the location was and how comfortable the bed was!!!!",4,2021,11,01
202,"A classy hotel, without a snobby attitude.","I've stayed at quite a few Westons.  The Dublin Weston is likely one of the greatest Westons I've stayed it.  I don't mean to speak poorly of some Westons, but I must admit that some of them are a bit snobby.  Not so the Dublin Weston.  A really nice, 5 star without the attitude. 

I can easily say what makes this property different from the others.  The staff.  Without any hesitation I will say that that I received the the warmest and most sincere welcome that I have ~ever~ been on the receiving end of was at the Dublin Weston.  Not just the front desk staff, but the entire staff.

The room was fine, just what I'd expect out of a Weston, the bar was great.  Excellent selection  and a rather surprisingly well informed bartender.  But every single interaction with the staff was superlative.  Period.

Good job Dublin Weston.  You exceeded my expectations, and Westons have a pretty high bar set already.",5,2021,10,26
202,5 star?,Cannot order any food at 0100. 5 star??? Not 5 star. Very good room and staff friendly. Room not cleared with coffee pots cups etc..having being served at 1100  and now 0115!!  Room Service provided no different to an Air B&B??,2,2021,10,16
202,The Dream Wedding Venue!,"The Westin is a beautiful hotel and we could not have wished for a better venue to have our dream wedding ‚Äì from the stunning Banking Hall to the amazing food to the five-star service. We changed our original venue to a city centre location and we are so delighted we did. We were familiar with the Mint Bar previously but we had no idea that the hotel housed such a stunning Banking Hall which really did take our breath away when we first viewed it. 

We first met Eilish, our wedding coordinator back in October last year, she was so warm and friendly and so accommodating, especially when changing our viewing to sooner than planned so we could go and see the venue before we went into lockdown. We booked the venue the next week, it was a no brainer! 

I cannot compliment Eilish and the team there enough, the service we have received from start to finish has been second to none, Eilish has been a joy to work with and made the wedding planning process so seamless and enjoyable. Her attention to detail and organisation made it so stress-free, and she dealt so patiently and efficiently with any queries we had ahead of the big day. I felt like we were on the same page every step of the way. 

The whole team were so attentive from our first meal tasting to the actual wedding day, they looked after our guests so well and we felt like VIPs for the whole day. The service was excellent and the food was amazing, all of our guests commented on how beautiful the food was and how stunning the Banking Hall looked, like 'a scene from Bridgerton' one of the guests commented. 

After all the planning we had done over the past year, we had complete trust in Eilish and the team, and we were able to relax and just enjoy the day. I highly recommend the Westin as a venue if you are looking fora 5-star wedding in the city centre. We cannot wait to go back to visit when all the renovations are completed, and we are so looking forward to going back for our first wedding anniversary next year!!",5,2021,10,01
202,Our Perfect Westin Wedding - 11th Sept 2021,"On Saturday 11th September, 2021 myself and new hubby had our wedding reception in the Westin Banking Hall and we could not have asked for a better venue or team of staff for the best day of our lives. Even with the hotel closed for renovations, you would never have known, we had exclusive use of the hotel which made it all that more special and personal.

All our guests remarked on the beauty of the Banking Hall, and the professional level of service from Westin staff, who were ever present and very friendly and helpful. They treated us and our guests like superstars from the moment we arrived until the last car pulled out of the building and they waved us goodbye. The food was superb and the service was fantastic. Nothing was too much for them.

A massive thank you to Eilish, the very professional, warm and friendly wedding coordinator who was on hand every step of the way from the first initial phone call right up to the end of the wedding day. Even in these challenging covid times, she made our dream day become a reality as her  attention to detail was second to none. Another massive thank you to Eamonn, the general manager, who was there for the whole weekend and always on hand for anything that was needed, he even brought a plate of our wedding cakes up to our room to enjoy later that night ‚Äì such a fabulous touch!
Thanks to Elaine, Sean, Stephen, Evelina & Roderick who were also a massive part of the weekend itself and all the rest of the team for your fabulous work and attention to detail.

I would 100% recommend the hotel to anyone for dinner, afternoon tea, weekend away or a wedding. I cannot thank you all enough for looking after us so well.
We cannot wait to return to The Westin. 

Warm Regards, 
Niamh & Brian",5,2021,09,24
202,One of the best hotel stays!,"The Westin is a fantastic hotel right in the heart of Dublin city centre and a stone's throw from temple bar. The rooms are modern and provide everything you need for a short or even long stay. 

What separates this hotel from the rest are the staff. Eamonn & his team went above & beyond continuously to ensure my stay was comfortable. 

If you looking for a hotel for business or pleasure then make it the Westin. I'll certainly be back again.",5,2021,07,28
202,Excellent staff and covid compliance,"Such a great stay in the Westin. We were there for two nights. Covid compliance was excellent, staff wore masks at all times and there were hand sanitizers and disposable masks available for guests.

It‚Äôs a beautiful hotel but the thing that stood out most was the staff.  They couldn‚Äôt do enough for us, they were attentive and helpful throughout the whole stay. Very friendly and super prompt with numerous requests we made, not just to the bridal suite but to my own room too.

The location is great too, it‚Äôs very central. I‚Äôd highly recommend staying in The Westin for any trip to Dublin.",5,2021,06,15
202,"Brilliant stay, beautiful place",Stayed here at the weekend for a wedding. The hotel is so beautiful and incredibly impressive!! The food was to die for also!!!

202,Mini Moon Celebrations,"My husband and I had a wonderful stay at the Westin. We got married on 19th December and spent two nights in the Westin on 20th and 21st December as part of the celebrations.

We arrived earlier than intended and it was lovely to be greeted by a lady just inside the front door who walked us to check in where we were advised that our room was ready. How wonderful! Upon check in we were upgraded to a junior suite - an incredible surprise. The room was absolutely beautiful. Later that afternoon a plate of desserts was sent to the room as a congratulations. What a gorgeous touch. After check in on the 20th, we popped down to the Atrium lounge for some lunch and it was so relaxing. On the 21st, we had afternoon tea in the Atrium lounge and it was just the most fabulous, festive experience.

I would like to add that the whole decor of the hotel is beautiful.

We intend on making our stay at the Westin a yearly tradition and we really look forward to returning.

Many thanks

202,Small Wedding - amazing from start to finish! ,"From the moment I rang the Westin on the 23rd of December to see could they host my small wedding on the 30th December (after my original venue closed), they could not have done enough for me. Elaine O‚ÄôHalloran was absolutely fantastic, she went above and beyond to make our day incredible at such short notice. Her professionalism, kindness and attention to detail was second to none and our wedding day would not have been the same without her. We had a fabulous meal for 12 in the Moreland‚Äôs grill and the food was absolutely delicious. The menu was exceptional and reasonably priced and the service was fantastic. All of our guests felt extremely safe and well looked after, which is a testament to the wonderful staff and management of the Westin hotel. We all had the luxury of staying in the beautiful hotel that night and what can I say, the rooms are superb. Myself and my new husband were kindly upgraded to a suite, which just topped off our already perfect day. I could not praise the Westin any more, from its ideal location, to the convenient valet parking, to the service, the beautiful decor and the fantastic food, I would 100% recommend the hotel to anyone and everyone for a meal, a weekend break or a wedding. I cannot thank you all anymore for looking after us all so well and I am already looking forward to our next stay when you reopen. Thanks again. ",5,2021,01,02
202,A nice relaxing pre-Christmas stay,"My wife and I stayed at the Westin just before Christmas and it was a very nice,relaxing, pleasant stay.  
The lobby was very tastefully decorated, and the reception staff were very polite and efficient.  We stayed in a room on the mezzanine floor, just off the Atrium bar.  The room was just the right size for a city centre hotel, and was clean and comfortable.
The Atrium bar was perfect for a pre- and post-dinner drink.  
The Moreland restaurant served excellent food both for dinner and breakfast.
Overall, a very nice hotel and we look forward to visiting it again in the near future.",5,2021,01,02
202,Incredibly relaxing business trip,"I was very impressed by my most recent stay at the Westin in Dublin. It was a business trip, so after a long day of work meetings, the friendly staff, the incredibly plush surrounding, my time spent dining there was delightful and relaxing. The perfect tonic to wind down after a long day. At the current time, with the anxiety around covid quite high, i felt very safe and reassured by the highest standards of cleanliness in the Westin.

202,Very nice,"My partner and I stayed at The Westin on December 25th and 26th.  It was the first time deciding to spend Christmas away from home.  We had never been to The Westin before so we
were looking forward to something 
different.   On arrival we were 
impressed with the lobby area and received a warm welcome.  Our room (standard double I think) was fabulously appointed and extremely comfortable.  We went for dinner and Wow, we did not expect to be having our Christmas Day dinner in such a magical, grand, cinematic setting.   It was stunning when we walked into the Banking Hall.   Dinner was delicious. After dinner we moved to Atrium lounge which was also stunning.  There was so much to see at The Westin.  It is exquisitely restored, maintained and decorated. The sound-proofed bedroom was a bonus.  
There seemed to be confusion over our slot for dinner,which I attempted to confirm a number of times by phone in the run up to Christmas and then on our arrival we spoke to Oowi who confirmed our 7pm sitting was no problem, however when we arrived, the host seemed confused and had to double check, while we waited in the hallway.   We were then ushered to a table which we realised was not fully set, so we presumed that they were not expecting us, despite out numerous efforts to confirm our booking.   There was no side plates or napkins.   We had to ask for these and water. We were not offered tea or coffee. We found Gary, the dining room host to be excellent, Oowi also came to our table, however it appeared that she didn't remember us from 2 hours earlier when she spoke with her. 
Breakfast both mornings was average and not hot.  Dinner on the 2and night was in the Moreland Grill.  It was nice.  The service was good. 
We found there to be a bit of chaos amongst staff, in the Moreland Grill.  
Overall, we were very satisfied with our stay, enjoyed it very much and would highly recommend a visit.   Surroundings and accommodation 10/10. Food 5/10.  Service 8/10.",5,2020,12,31

We had a cocktail in the Atrium lounge before and after dinner which had a pianist playing such soothing music throughout the evening. We had breakfast up in our room which again was of such a high standard it really was worth every penny. Only thing I would change is that I upgraded our room to a club room a few days before our stay and our room was smaller than I had expected.

Stunning Christmas decorations, such elegant details to the hotel and the staff were confident, genuinely pleasant and very attentive. 

Our dinner including the halibut was to die for, the cocktails were exquisite and the breakfast options suited up both which was perfect especially when the hot fresh pastries where individually brought to our table.

No noise from being in the centre of the city, rooms where very spacious, spotless and decorated to a luxurious level.

Worth every cent, going back for afternoon tea with my family and our wedding in 2021 ü§û.

Could not recommend it more, considering I travel for work and stay in hotels 3 nights a week it was by far memorable.

202,Fantastic Stay,"I'd been wanting to stay at The Westin since December 2019 - No time like a  Christmas staycation to realise the dream!

Here's my takeaway from our stay:

- The Christmas Decor across the hotel is beautiful, as were the room setups - You can tell there's a lot of effort 
   that goes into the hotel presentation.
- We opted for the Afternoon tea which was amazing. Every single piece of food that I ate was delicious. I also 
   loved the selection of teas available and the cocktails.
- The staff are something else. Incredibly friendly, professional, well presented and more than happy to help you 
   out. I thought every interaction I had with the staff was incredibly positive and can't fault anything there.
- The dinner and breakfast at Moreland's Grill was lovely. The food was beautiful, our table was situated in a 
   fantastic position and there was plenty of space and ambience.
- The hotel room was overall really lovely. The king sized bed was one of the comfiest I've ever slept on. The room 
   was incredibly clean and there was plenty of storage space.

The only few critiques I would give are:

- There were a few things missing in the room, such as toothbrushes and toothpaste. 
- The fridge was off and locked so I had to call service staff to fix this.
- We were overcharged upon checkout for things we hadn't ordered at dinner.

All of these small issues were sorted straight away and I can't thank the staff enough for how fantastic  they were.

I would highly recommend staying at The Westin.",5,2020,12,15

202,AMAZING,Our stay was fabulous from start to finish. The staff really made our stay special as they made everything so easy and we‚Äôre so friendly! The room was fabulous and so spacious even for the 3 of us in the same room! The food was delicious.,5,2020,12,14
202,Wonderful all around,"Great location and short walk to Trinity College, Grafton Street, Temple Bar area, etc. Staff was very nice and accommodating, particularly the concierge who was so helpful with directions and restaurant information. Beautiful and well-appointed hotel.  My only negative is I didn't like the room I stayed in that had absolutely no view except a skylight to the industrial roof.  That was a disappointment that I think they should warn guests about or give a discount for.  But since I was barely in my room luckily it didn't have a huge impact on my stay. Would definitely stay there again and just make sure I didn't get that room.",4,2020,12,13
202,Liz,"We had a great night in the Westin hotel during vivid, everything was extremely well done and we felt very comfortable and safe, the staff were very nice and we were made to feel very welcome, we will definitely return again",5,2020,12,12
202,Great location and staff,"We booked for a night out. Staff were all very pleasant and helpful. The hotel is very cosy and comfortable and we had a lovely night out.
The only let down was the food. Hotel food and not restaurant. 
Dinner was disappointing and nothing exciting. Steak and prawns were overdone and flavours were odd. The breakfast was overdone also and seating a bit close for our liking, so we ate quickly and left.
Overall we would go back, but would eat elsewhere.",4,2020,12,12
202,CoVid Christmas break,"My wife and I stayed in the Westin for a 2 night break. From the moment we booked the room until we checked out, I cannot fault the team at the Westin. The room was fantastic, the staff helpful and friendly. We had dinner one of the nights in the Moreland Grill and the set menu was top quality and great value. Breakfast was nice to be served to the table, again the restaurant staff were very nice and helpful. The cleanliness & safety measures at the hotel made us feel comfortable during these trying times and the stay was a welcome break. Thanks again to the Westin staff who looked after us so well.",5,2020,12,11
202,Wonderful overnight stay in the heart of Dublin City,"I couldn't speak highly enough about our overnight stay in the
Westin. We arrived early intending to leave our luggage and go shopping. However, room was ready and we were given an upgrade which was delightful.  All staff we met were extremely friendly, efficient and provided excellent service.  The location couldn't be better and rates were very  competitive.  I would love to return again.  Kay",5,2020,12,11
202,Mini break ,"We stayed in the Westin Hotel from Sunday to Wednesday. We had dinner on the first night which was lovely .
All the staff from reception  to floor staff were very helpful  during  out stay. The foyer was done up to the ninth degree,with Christmas  trees decorations &Santa's  to beat the band... We treated  ourselves  to a suite which had an upstairs- lovely layout and a very comfy bed.  We were very close to Grafton  St and had a few strolls both day & night up to it  to see the love lights.
I would highly recommend  the Westin to stay in either for a night or three !!! Really a special  treat.
We will be back .üòâ",5,2020,12,10
202,Overnight stay in city,"Excellent service , food and comfort. An oasis in the city centre and perfect location for shopping eating out and visiting. Very competitive pricing and kudos for looking after frontline workers much appreciated",5,2020,12,09
202,It doesnt get much better than the Westin,"As 2020 has essentially been cancelled we wanted a night away, just for a bit of normality. We chose the Westin as they were doing an amazing offer to honor Frontline Workers. My only regret is that we didn't stay longer. The hotel is more than covid compliant with hand sanitizer and anti bac wipes in the room and hand sanitizer points throughout the hotel. The room itself was stunning and I can happily say Ive never had a nights sleep like it. The location is perfect for a wander around town so we got to see all the Christmas lights after having a drink in the Atrium which is just magical. Actually the minute you step in the door of the hotel, its honestly like being in another world.",5,2020,12,09
202,Enjoyable stay ,"Stayed for one night b/b and dinner it was very enjoyable. Warm welcome from both the doorman and check in staff. 

Stayed in room 420 which had small outdoor balcony and great view of Westmorland street. Room was excellent and bed was really comfortable and box of chocolates in room  was nice touch. 

Dinner was in the mint bar small enough menu but service was excellent. Starters and desserts were also excellent as was the turkey and ham main course but my only complaint was it was warm and not hot. 

Breakfast in the grill bar was also excellent and Covid restrictions were really well managed. Hotel in great location for shopping and nightlife we parked in the nearby Fleet Street car park were you can park for 24 hours for 19euro. You must have your parking ticket endorsed by the hotel when you checkout.",5,2020,12,08
202,Fabulous visit to the Westin Hotel,"Location was excellent ..city centre . Amazing staff ..all so nice and facilitating. The General Manager was extremely helpful in every way.
Our room was really. lovely .breakfast was presented beautifully as was dinner in the Morelands restaurant..food delicious..overall a 5 star experience.",5,2020,12,08
202,An oasis in the Capital,The Westin is a tiny oasis in the capital and its location to all the shopping and cultural areas are quiet literally on your doorstep. Everyone at the Westin will give you a huge welcome. The Atrium lounge is a must to soak up the atmosphere before your dinner. Everything at the Westin is without question flawless. Cant heap enough praise on the staff and the welcome from the get go. You won‚Äôt be disappointed.,5,2020,12,08
202,Wedding,"Exceptional service from start to finish special shout out to Eilish & all the staff. They made our wedding that extra bit special would highly recommend anyone staying or getting married here. Can‚Äôt wait to stay here again happy Christmas all.

202,Family Wedding,"Exceptional service from start to finish. As a small wedding group of just 20 people the hotel did great to have our rooms ready early with a warm welcome. Gareth and Kenneth (twins) at the front door remembered by all the family, big thanks to them as they couldn‚Äôt help enough",5,2020,12,06
202,Being treated like home,"Confortable stay with very friendly and helpful staff. Staying there during last months took away a lot of the problems from COVID and made it very simple, being totally flexible with my needs.
I am going to miss the amazing breakfast and nice staff.",5,2020,12,05
202,Incredible wedding at the Westin,"My sister got married last Saturday and all I can say is how incredible the staff were, so friendly, helpful and attentive. The decorations and food were fabulous. Special thanks to Stephen, the concierge, he was absolutely amazing and really went out of his way to help, will definitely be backüòä

Therese",5,2020,12,01
202,Bed made of clouds!,"We stayed at the Westin for a wedding during Covid and it was such a treat. The staff were lovely, hygiene was excellent and the room was the most comfortable room I have slept in my life. Nothing was too much - they even valeted my bike! The banking hall where the reception was held is breath-taking and the whole experience was dreamy.",5,2020,11,02
202,The Perfect Wedding Venue,"My husband and I recently held our wedding at The Westin and we would highly recommend it to any couple.

With less than three weeks notice due to a change of venue, every detail of our wedding was organised to the highest standard. I have to commend the work of Eilish, the Events Manager, who helped organise our wedding. She was a joy to work with and made everything as stress free as possible.

We held our ceremony and reception in the Banking Hall. It is such a spectacular room and even though we could only invite 25 guests, the space was perfectly appointed and did not feel too big for such a small, intimate group. The food was fantastic and everything was prepared perfectly. The entire staff were absolutely fantastic and no request was too much trouble. Their expertise ensured the entire day ran like clock work. 

I cannot praise the Westin enough for making our wedding such a memorable day. We will find it difficult to pass by without popping in for a coffee of cocktail in The Atrium to reminisce.  I would recommend The Westin without reservation to any couple getting married.",5,2020,11,01
202,Perfect overnight stay!!,"We booked a last minute overnight stay with afternoon tea and from the moment we arrived it was just so special! The staff were so welcoming from the time we arrived.
Our room was just amazing! We had a room on the top floor looking out over college green and the grounds of Trinity College. It was so nice to curl up on the balcony with tea and look out over the city ‚ù§Ô∏è
Our afternoon tea in the atrium was beautiful and there was no issue having it adjusted to a vegetarian menu for us. Breakfast the following morning was delicious and there were loads of options to suit us both. 
We could not recommend this hotel enough and once restrictions are lifted we will definitely be booking another stay. 
We live in Dublin but this was the perfect place to stay for our mini break away during Covid an we can't wait to go back it was such a treat and we could not fault our stay at all!!!!",5,2020,10,31
202,Autumn Wedding,"Due to Covid restrictions our son and his bride decided to change date and venue at short notice.
The staff at The Westin couldn‚Äôt have been more helpful at a very stressful time. The bride and groom and their 25 guests were greeted warmly and treated royally.
The venue is stunning and so atmospheric. Even though it was a small wedding the layout of the room ensured that rather than feeling lost, we could really appreciate the fabulous decor and features. The photos taken in the hotel and in nearby St.Stephen‚Äôs Green are wonderful.
The service and food were absolutely excellent. The staff did everything possible to ensure that the day was a true celebration despite Covid restrictions. 
We all agreed that while it was an entirely different wedding than that planned, we wouldn‚Äôt change a thing. 
Thank you to all of the staff who really contributed to a very special day. ",5,2020,10,31
202,My Dublin Oasis ,"I stayed in The Westin last weekend and have been yearning to go back ever since. Everything was exceptional, the staff were so friendly and helpful from reception to the doorman. I really can‚Äôt fault my stay. This was my second staycation and I‚Äôm so glad I went. My room was so luxurious, the view of trinity and the bath all made it extra special. We dined in the Morelands grill and had our desert in the atrium, the gin garden is superb!! The Westin is a must for Dubliners and I can‚Äôt wait to go back, thank you to the whole staff!!!!",5,2020,10,24
202,Just fab,"From the minute we arrived we were treated fantastically. All the staff we met, at reception, the front door, lounge and restaurant were so friendly and helpful. It was such a relaxing stay. The Atrium lounge  had a great atmosphere even with  all Covid precautions in place. We had a lovely meal in the restaurant, again, so relaxing.
I'd highly recommend a stay at the Westin- I'll definitely be back ",5,2020,10,23
202,A lockdown local stsy,"Had a fantastic stay here a couple of weeks ago.
We availed of the dinner, bed & breakfast option. 
Every single member of staff we encountered was extremely professional and friendly. We stayed in one of the newly refurbished rooms which were modern and well designed.
We ate in Morelands Grill and the food and service were fantastic. We had a couple of drink in the Atrium Lounge which had a really nice atmosphere with everyone sitting around enjoying the pianist.
A lovely stay given the restrictions hotels have to work within. ",5,2020,10,22
202,Relaxed and enjoyable stay,"Staff were excellent. Bed was very comfortable. Dinner and breakfast were delicious.
Thank you for the lovely stay.  Everything in place to support a  COVID -19 safe environment.
From appreciated health care worker",5,2020,10,21
202,Excellent breakaway,"Myself and my fiance had our wedding and honeymoon unfortunately postponed this year but we had the days off anyway. So we decided to treat ourselves to a trip to the Westin and we were not disappointed.  From the moment we came in, to the moment we left we were treated amazingly by all the staff.  Room service, breakfast,  bar staff, reception staff. It was all absolutely fantastic.  Highly recommended.",5,2020,10,21
202,The perfect break,"Even under the unusual times in which we are living, we had the most enjoyable stay at the weekend in the Westin. We were welcomed at checkin and assigned a beautiful spacious room with a complimentary box of Butlers chocolates. The decor was fabulous, beds were so comfortable and the room temperature was perfect. Quickly after we ate lunch in The Atrium Lounge and later dined in the Moreland Grill. Breakfast the next morning was also very enjoyable. 
Thank you so much we will be back once you are able to re-open again!",5,2020,10,20
202,Misled when booking/ picking and choosing who government guidelines apply to,"When deciding which hotel to stay in for our three night staycation we contacted a number of properties and all of them told us they had a residents bar or somewhere to get a drink without having to order food, as I believe there are different restrictions in this regard than in comparison to external restaurants and bars. I specifically asked the question to this hotel via Instagram ‚Äúis there somewhere I can get a drink without ordering food‚Äù before booking as if there wasn‚Äôt I would have gone to one of the dozen hotels we were considering that do offer this and was told that the atrium lounge is open to residents. So I thought brilliant, the hotel looks lovely, the atrium lounge upon investigating looked lovely with lovely cocktails so I booked it. When we arrived I was extremely disappointed to discover this was not the case. We could not order a drink without food and also the chef was only there for very limited hours so we couldn‚Äôt even order food at 1.30 pm to have a drink with. So yes the atrium is physically open but it is not open for food and drink for the majority of the day. Fair enough if they are following guidelines that other hotels don‚Äôt follow if this is the case but I wish they would have been honest and up front about it so I could have booked to stay in a different hotel. Also if they are simply following government guidelines then why do they only follow it for some guests and not others? On the first day we arrived we had drinks and lunch and a couple sat down near us and ordered drinks only and no food and nothing was said to them they weren‚Äôt made to order food like we were and they enjoyed their drinks. Found this very upsetting and confusing. Wouldn‚Äôt recommend and won‚Äôt be back unfortunately.",1,2020,10,20
202,Staycation,"Myself and my friend were due to travel to Doolin on a staycation but due to lockdown measures we had to stay in Dublin so decided to treat ourselves to a stay in The Westin

It is a beautiful hotel. Our room was fantastic and we got a free upgrade which was  a very nice surprise. All the staff were fantastic and the Covid measures they had introduced really gave us peace of mind.

The only slight tarnishes for the our stay was dessert at dinner. It was a brownie but it was rock hard. I couldn't get my fork or spoon through it. Also breakfast the next morning was a little underwhelming

But over all we had a fantastic time and the beds were beyond comfortable. I slept solidly for 10 hours. We would definitely be back",4,2020,10,20
202,Disappointed,Just read a review of this hotel where it said you could see staff talking about the guest's that's exactly what happened us when we arrived we were told that 6 rooms was booked in our name instead of three obviously the receptionist made a mistake while taking our booking but we were made feel it was our's as the manager had a very condescending attitude while we ate dinner he came into the dining area and looked like he was telling the staff they stared at us for the night it was so uncomfortable we are six fronline worker's and was really looking forward to the break but was ruined my someone else's mistake and rude staff.,3,2020,10,20
202,Cannot recommend enough!,"Our stay in the Westin from start to finish is amazing every time. The most friendly staff who cannot do enough for you. Sean from reception and manager Sean are an asset to the hotel. Both remember us every time which makes our stay that little bit more personal.
Spacious room and luxurious decor! ",5,2020,10,19
202,Lovely room and great service!,"I recently enjoyed a night away in The Westin, Dublin and everything was perfect.
The check in was seamless when I arrived early and the room was lovely & spacious.
I recommend having lunch or afternoon tea in the The Atrium lounge as it is a beautiful space and they provided excellent service.
I look forward to staying again soon!",5,2020,10,19
202,Wedding Venue,"We recently organised our wedding in The Westin Dublin.  Due to Covid and the changing restrictions we successfully did this within 8 days which could not have been done without the help of everyone at The Westin and particularly Eilis Kealy the wedding and events coordinator.  I had previously attended a wedding here years ago and while looking for a Dublin venue it came to mind, we phoned them and spoke to Elaine and from that phone call on we knew it would be the perfect place.  Eilis, Elaine and all the other staff made us feel like royalty from beginning to end.  We viewed and booked the wedding 1 week out from the day and the Westin took over from there and we didn‚Äôt have to worry.
The food and drink was absolutely delicious and the service some of the best we have ever received.  They provided us with a great wedding rate for the accommodation so our few guests could stay over and upgraded us free of charge to the most amazing suite we have ever been in.  The staff were friendly, courteous and always so helpful and we are so glad despite all the changes that we had our wedding here. Many of our friends and family were so impressed with the hotel and are already looking to spending some time there on their next staycation.  Could not recommend the Westin enough.",5,2020,10,18
202,Amazing getaway!,"My partner and I stayed here for one night under the healthcare hero deal to celebrate my birthday and we had such an amazing time! The staff were so welcoming, friendly and pleasant, our room was beautiful and the food was to die for!! The dinner was exquisite and the breakfast in the morning was the best hotel breakfast we'd ever had. What really made our stay however, was the piano in the lounge after dinner - everything was just so special, we'll definitely be back!",5,2020,10,18
202,Amazing Staycation ,Myself and my Mam stayed here last weekend on dinner bed and breakfast package. From the moment we arrived we felt so welcome and all staff were very friendly and attentive. Under current circumstances we felt very safe as everyone was wearing masks and there was plenty of sanitation stations throughout the hotel. We also got upgraded to a suite which was amazing! We will definitely return. ,5,2020,10,17
202,Fabulous stay!,"My husband and I booked a night at the Westin after a cancelled wedding anniversary trip. I must say that our stay more than made up for it! The wonderful staff made us feel really special with our stunning room overlooking Trinity college and superb, friendly service (especially Liam in the Atrium bar). We enjoyed a three course meal from Hardy's bistro that was out of this world. 
Well worth ever cent!",5,2020,10,17
202,Another fabulous stay,"Booked this hotel for a Saturday night for an overnight staycation. 
We got an excellent rate for a Saturday night. 
Checkin was efficient and the front of house were very friendly. Nothing was too much hassle. Restaurant reservations were offered also. 
Our room on the 1st floor had great views of Trinity College. Huge comfortable bed with luxurious linen. Comfortable furnishings and a large bathroom. An easy room to relax in. 
We booked a table in a local bar for a few hours for food. On return to our room a box of Butlers chocolate and a thank you card for choosing the hotel was left in our room. A nice personal touch. The hotel is right in the centre of the city, centrally located between Grafton Street and Henry Street. 
Breakfast was amazing. Served in Morelands Grill, it was well staffed and attentive. Breakfast was of a high standard and very tasty. Good quality coffee too. 
Check out was disappointing (only because we didnt want to leave :-) ). The front of house staff again couldn't be more helpful and friendly. 
We received a personalised thank you from the hotel manager by email on the Monday again thanking us for our stay. Again another nice touch. 
Will definitely be having another staycation here. Highly recommended! 

",5,2020,10,16
202,Flawless experience,"Due to restrictions in Dublin myself and a friend decided to celebrate our birthdays and book into a hotel in our home county (restrictions meant we could not leave our county). The Westin was excellent value for a dinner/ B&B rate which we needed as restaurants are currently only permitted to open outdoor seating areas. It was a Sunday so the hotel was very quiet but that didn't bother us. There was a lovely piano medley of popular songs playing in the Atrium and we had cocktails and chats followed by a meal there. My only negative on our whole stay was that my main course was only lukewarm and I didn't love what I ordered (but someone else might love it) but starter and dessert were lovely as was the wine and breakfast. I particularly recommend the chef's smoothie. The staff were amazing throughout and the bed was so comfortable!  The location was perfect too, right beside Temple Bar, 2 minute walk to Grafton Street and O'Connell Street. Would definitely recommend!",5,2020,10,15
202,Fabulous stay,"We stayed in the Westin last saturday night.  I checked in early and the staff member was very accommodating even though I was early.  The room was gorgeous, the staff were so nice & really helpful.  During the dinner the staff were extremely attentive even though they have a really difficult job right now with the masks and the heat in the restaurant.  The staff remembered us the next morning at breakfast which I thought was a nice touch.  We had a lovely meal and breakfast.  The location is the best for the centre of Dublin.  A fantastic stay, thank you again.",5,2020,10,14
202,Nop Notch,"Myself and my wife recently stayed in the Westin hotel. The facilities are amazing and the location is perfect.

The room was lovely and the staff were very friendly and accommodating.

We will definately return in the near future.

202,Lovely stay in the Westin,"We stayed in the Westin on a Saturday evening. The room was beautiful. We also had afternoon tea and ate dinner in morelands grill. All the food was excellent. The staff were all adhering to covid guidelines and we felt the hotel was very safe to stay in.

202,Weekend 10th october,"We love staying in The Westin and last saturday exceeded our expectations. The room was lovely, we had a great meal in Morelands Restaurant and finished off the evening in The Atrium.

202,Saturday night stay,"For a birthday treat we spend last Saturday in The Westin . We booked an overnight with evening meal and b and b.I cannot recommend this hotel highly enough.  From the moment you arrive at the door to the late checkout when leaving,  it is pure class. Thanks to all the staff who go above and beyond , with a great sense of pride in their jobs . Location is ideal for shopping being near either Grafton street or a short walk to Henry street. I will definitely be back.

202,Excellent,"All staff were very friendly and attentive. Rooms were well appointed, clean and beds were very comfortable. Felt very safe with covid protocols in place which made it very easy to relax and be able to enjoy the stay.",5,2020,10,12
202,Outstanding,"The Westin Dublin is truly a place where the guest experience is front and centre of everything they do. 

We were greeted with a warm welcome at check-in, and each staff member we encountered couldn't have been more helpful during our stay.

Afternoon Tea was fantastic in The Atrium Lounge, with attentive and genuine hospitality from Vera and Evelina. 

The Heritage Deluxe King room which we stayed in was beautifully appointed and really lives up to the five star promise of this property. 

The hotel was spotlessly clean, and all covid-19 guidelines were met and often exceeded. 

I'd highly recommend the Westin Dublin for those looking for a unique luxury stay in the centre of Dublin.",5,2020,10,10
202,Delightful Way to go Out for Dinner in Dublin,What a fantastic place to stay right in the heart of Dublin City.

202,Wow!,"What an experience! From the doorman right through to the reception and waiter staff, this was such a fantastic stay. The food was delicious, the room was large and the bed was extremely comfortable. The temperature of the room was just right and not too hot like most hotels which make it more uncomfortable. Dined in the Morelands Grill also and the food was delicious. Well worth the effort organising the time away! The booking initially meant I did not have to plan dinner also so was all very seamless and easy. Will definitely stay again. The atrium was fabulous also where we got to have our dessert and drinks.",5,2020,10,06

Our experience started with the friendship of the concierge at the front entrance, very friendly, helpful gentleman. Check-in was also a very friendly, speedy experience. Our room was beautiful, spacious, spotless and cosy. Dinner was very nice and the piano player in the Atrium was excellent. Breakfast was excellent, fresh and great choice. All in all a great experience, I'll be back. Kathleen Q.",5,2020,10,05

Would definitely reccomend and will be back for sure!",5,2020,10,02
202,Amazing Birthday Fun ,"Being in lockdown in Dublin meant we couldn‚Äôt leave the county for my partners birthday so I looked for a city break. I booked online weeks before and the communication with the hotel was exemplary. We chatted and emailed about afternoon tea and dinner bookings and they went out of their way to make us happy. We stayed in one of their beautiful suites and the room was so spacious, warm and as always had a Westin bed to die for. Best sleep we‚Äôve had in ages. Afternoon tea was brought up to our room with cocktails and then we went down to the restaurant to have our dinner. We had the steak and French red wine and both were exquisite. Due to the paired back staff we had two waiters who brought up our afternoon tea, sang happy birthday and then served us dinner and wine and they were both so friendly and even gave us a free cocktail at the end of the night. It was like being in a boutique hotel. The hotel could not have been more safe and compliant with Covid regulations while at the same time being friendly, helpful and caring. We did not want to leave. We only live ten minutes away but it felt like we‚Äôd been a holiday to a different world. Thank you. ",5,2020,10,02
202,Our Luxury Staycation,Living in Dublin we decided to staycation in Dublin. Little did we know what a great experience was waiting for us. From the beautiful Hotel to the warm welcoming staff who greeted us with a smile and provided us we excellent service. The room was spotlessly clean and very comfortable. As there is a lock down there was very little to do in Dublin so we made the most of the hotel and all it had to offer. The cocktails were excellent and the food was delicious. I would definitely recommend the Westin Hotel and would stay there again.,5,2020,10,01
202,Our brilliant Wedding at the Westin,"We had originally planned a large wedding in the West of Ireland but with a change in the travel restrictions in Ireland we had to cancel with a week remaining. We decided we wanted to go ahead in Dublin and contacted a few of the big hotels in the city. On visiting the Westin we were immediately struck by the Banking Hall, it was a spectacular and grand room with ample room for social distance.

Having already been wowed by the room our decision was made when we met our wedding planner Eilish. Despite the ridiculously short amount of time  until the big W day, she was totally on top of things and managed to organise everything we were looking for on the day, all the time staying calm and reassuring to us, who were obviously having our moments of panic! 

The reception itself went off without a hitch. The food was delicious, the staff efficient and friendly. There wasn't a single complaint from any of our guests, only praise for how smooth everything was. We were only able to have 25 guests but something about that beautiful room meant it never felt like a small wedding. 

In terms of accommodation, the wedding suite was incredible, probably the nicest room we've ever stayed in overlooking trinity, college green and a view up O'Connel St. And again, any of our party who stayed in the hotel said the rooms, service, and staff were second to none. Nothing was any trouble and always with a smile, they have a great staff working there.

Anyone thinking of having a Dublin wedding, or even a nice city break, I would highly recommend the Westin. It wasn't the day we had planned, but we got an incredible and memorable day that would have been hard to beat in our original plan. And organised for us in the space of a week! A Big thank you to Eamonn and his team for everything!!",5,2020,10,01

202,Excellent stay,"Hi I want to thank you especially the girl on reception on Saturday checkin mid day, apologies I never took her name as she was so friendly welcoming and overall very professional. She was delighted to inform us that we were upgraded to a beautiful room. We enjoyed our stay. The guys working in both the Morelands Grill and the Attrium were also very friendly and professional. The food was fab. We felt very safe given the current covid crisis. Well done! We'll be back.",5,2020,09,21
202,Best stay ever,"Looking for a quiet, romantic, break I decided to try the Westin Hotel.    Before arrival I arranged a number of items to make the stay more special and nothing was too much trouble.     Checked in with Niall who made the experience memorable as he chatted away while also smoothly going through the check in procedure.
The room was gorgeous.   Had everything you might need and was a real home from home.   I called down for dental kits and extra robes and they were delivered within minutes and with a professionalism that others could learn from.
Breakfast next day was great.    We didn't see the bakers basket on the menu but do ask for it.    The cooked breakfast was cooked to perfection and, in other hotels can be a little too salty, but here realy was just perfect.   My wife even asked for an apple and the immediate response was if she would like it peeled     Nothing was too much.    A shame I did not get the waitresses name but she was first rate.      A great experience.
On check out I met General Manager Eamonn Casey who asked after my stay, was genuine and warm in wanting to confirm that our stay had met our expectations.   In truth it was so far beyond this that I felt the need to write my first Tripadvisor review.    Highly recommended to all!!!",5,2020,09,21
202,night away,"Fantastic hotel and very helpful and welcoming staff. We stayed here as they had a fantastic offer for heath are staff. Have worked all through covid and delighted to get a break in a lovely hotel. From the moment the door is opened for you, you are treated like royalty",5,2020,09,21
202,Elegant and Luxurious ,"We are just back from a special stay in The Westin for my birthday celebrations, and elegant and luxurious are the only two words to describe how flawless our stay was!

We stayed in room M11- this room is out of this world! Soundproof windows which is perfect for a city centre location, the bed was heavenly and this made for a relaxing night. The room is very elegantly appointed with a lot of natural light, and was at a very comfortable temperature, and the shower controls were great being at the opposite end of the shower. 

There are enhancement packages you can add to your room, one being a Gin & Tonic bar and this looked like it would be fun!

The decor in the halls are also very modern and stylish. There were also beautiful fresh flower arrangements on the dining tables and in the lobby, this added a beautiful touch.

We dined in Morelands Grill- Liam looked after us and he was just lovely! The food was so delicious, and the service was relaxing and enjoyable. There is plenty of space in Morelands Grill also. It is not cramped like most city centre restaurants and also has great views of the City if you get a table by the window!

Breakfast was also very relaxing with plenty to choose from, and a lovely strong breakfast tea to start the day ü§ó 

There is plenty of management presence at all times in the lobby/reception and also in the restaurant. They have plenty of Covid measures in place, we felt so safe and there are also bottles of hand sanitizers on all the tables too!

The cherry on top of our stay, was the beautiful live piano music in The Atrium Lounge! On check in we went up to have tea and it was just so relaxing, a total switch off from what is going on in the world! I wish I could have sat all day drinking tea and listening to the piano, it was most enjoyable and was my favourite part of our stay! The beautiful china cups have a lovely design which matches the beautiful walls, it was so stylish. After dinner we also went to The Atrium for drinks and more piano music, I didn‚Äôt want the night to end! I was so sad when 10:30 came and the music stopped. It is definitely something we want to come back and do again.

Thank you to all the team in The Westin for making us feel so special , every single second was enjoyable and we will definitely be back!!",5,2020,09,20
202,Fabulous staff and lovely hotel,Thanks to the wonderful Elaine in reservations and the super friendly Jane at reception for ensuring we had a lovely stay at the beautiful hotel full of old world charm...the beds are so comfy and the breakfast was fab... Thanks to Marcin for even parking our car. Definitely going to return again.,5,2020,09,20
202,Fabulous hotel,"I can't say enough about our stay from check in to check out. The location is perfect a quick 10 minutes to Grafton Street for endless shopping & 5 minutes from Templebar. 
Our room was fab. Comfortable beds, beautiful bathroom, even a coffee maker. Had dinner at reasonable price, great choice & service & really tasty. Breakfast was served with lots to choose from & yummy. Looking forward to staying again soon.",5,2020,09,20
202,Wonderful Stay,Wonderful stay at The Westin. We stayed here for a night as part of our minimoon and the service was excellent from start to finish. Staff were friendly and helpful. The room was clean and comfortable and it was clear that COVID19 safety measures were in place. We will definitely be returning for another stay!,5,2020,09,19
202,Perfect Stay at the Westin,"From the moment we arrived everything was just faultless. I was checked in efficiently and given all of the relevant information about breakfast etc. Our room was just the right blend of modern and luxurious and was spotlessly clean. I was so impressed that the shower controls were at the opposite end to the water flow, such a simple thing and yet it is brilliant! Breakfast each morning was fabulous, it was table service but there was plenty of choice and everything was freshly made. We had afternoon tea to celebrate my birthday in the beautiful surroundings of the Atrium and again this was flawless, such a beautiful selection. Even if I had gone looking for a problem I wouldn't have found one, everything was just perfect.",5,2020,09,15
202,Luxurious Treat,"Highly recommend a visit. Throughout our stay the staff were welcoming professional and helpful. Attention to CoVid-19 safety measures was highly noticeable & appreciated. Our room was plush,with a deluxe bathroom (with lovely quality bathroom products). We enjoyed restful sleep in a comfortable bed and supporting pillows. Wide variety and high standard breakfast menu. I chose a scrumptious salmon dish for dinner. Extras included dressing gowns, water, Nespresso machine, variety of teas, hand & surface anti-bacterial wipes & liquid hand sanitizer. Looking forward to a return visit.",5,2020,09,15
202,Just perfect,From the moment we checked in to the Westin our perfect night in Dublin began. Our room on the 4th floor overlooking Trinity was fabulous with a really lovely marble tiled bathroom. Dinner at Morelands was superb and a few cocktails after in the Atrium with live piano music was so relaxing and enjoyable. I had the best pancakes for breakfast and my husband had eggs royale which were amazing. Service throughout our stay was excellent and we were really taken with the cheerful friendliness of all of the staff. Covid measures have been taken most seriously and we felt reassured that guest safety was a priority. We had a late checkout and can honestly say 24 hours at the Westin left us feeling as rejuvenated as if we‚Äôd had a week away. Top marks all round!,5,2020,09,14
202,Fantastic üòä,"We stayed here on a very special occasion and we certainly were treated as so. The service from each member of staff in which we encountered was outstanding, from a very warm welcome from the reception team, right through to our departure. 
The room was impeccable, and facilitated us with everything we needed. As far as COVID, the hotel was well equipped and even had sanitizer in the bedroom.
Very comfortable and pleasant stay, and looking forward to staying again! A big thank you to Doiran and Jane on front desk!!",5,2020,09,14
202,disappointed - need attention to details,"when did such a star rated hotel served breakfast in 2 tiers plastic pots???  not having a buffet is not excuse for the poor breakfast we were offered and the portion size we got. no refill was offered,- I am still chocked at the yaourt/fruits served in what looks like a McDonald take away pot!!! 
We asked if we could enjoyed a drink in the bar when coming back from an outside meal, we were told yes, so we booked a table. When taking hold of our table, we were then told that we had to eat to be served a drink. We were not made aware that this rule is also applied to resident of the hotel! staff should have known. and not drinking in your room at room service rate is not the option I was looking for paying to stay in a hotel.
room: the expresso machine , great, but no water in the tank.. . 1 packet of biscuit for 2 ....little details. add more cups  so we dont have to do the washing up with shower gel.

Nice touch:  for the plate of little cakes (3 cakes, 2 persons, again little details) left in the room for us.",3,2020,09,14
202,"Love the Westin, great location, supper service.","Westin Dublin is a beautiful building, our room had a magnificent view looking over Trinity College & the city, The location Is perfect for exploring Dublin City centre.
We had dinner in hotel restaurant, food & service was great.",5,2020,09,14
202,Westin Hotel Review,"Met a friend I hadn‚Äôt seen in months due to Covid and we decided to treat ourselves and book into The Westin. What a treat it was, from the moment we arrived we were greeted by the most pleasant staff at reception. We were upgraded to a suite with the most amazing views down onto Temple Bar. The room itself was of exceptional standard and the suite had its very own living room on the next floor. Covid safety measures were adhered to but in a very gentle fashion and there was even a small hand sanitising station in our room We felt super safe there. 
The breakfast was superb with a huge selection of wonderful pastries not to mention the full Irish! The staff were so polite and couldn‚Äôt do enough. The location was the cherry on top. Can‚Äôt wait to return for our next night out in the Big Smoke! 
Thanks for making our trip to Dublin a memorable one. See you soon. 
Debbie",5,2020,09,13
202,Wonderful Stay,"My daughters and I had the most wonderful stay in the Westin. From the moment we arrived until we departed we had the most relaxing stay. All of the staff we encountered were extremely friendly, helpful and professional. Special mention of gratitude to Jeremy in reservations and Niall at reception for their help.

The hotel is outstanding (especially the Heavenly Beds). The attention to detail throughout makes the experience so enjoyable and memorable. This attention to detail was also evident in the hotel‚Äôs implementation of the Covid guidelines, which is managed discreetly and very efficiently. 

As a Healthcare worker I was fortunate enough to be able to avail of the special rate offered to Healthcare workers by the Westin, for which I would like to say a very big Thank You, it was very much appreciated. We have already booked another stay and cannot wait to come back for another relaxing stay.",5,2020,09,12
202,O‚Äô Rourke,"Having stayed there on Saturday night last I felt it only fair I leave a review. From the moment we arrived, until we left on Sunday morning the hospitality was exceptional. On arrival we were greeted by the Manager and his friendly personality was a fine example of what we were to experience during our stay. During these hard and challenging times the hotel staff make us feel welcome and done everything in their power to enable us to enjoy our stay. Situated in the heart of Dublin City and our room over looking the historic Trinity College it was a lovely way to spend an enjoyable and relaxing night away as a family.",5,2020,09,08

Just great !!",5,2020,09,07
202,Break Away,After a difficult start to our short break away our welcome by Sean soon put our travel troubles behind us. Super check in a lovely upgrade that was richly appreciated. The hotel is looking  absolutely amazing and safe. I know there are so many restrictions and the only place it was visibly noticeable for me was breakfast. The staff were amazing as the food but not having the buffet was strange as weekends away are about indulgence. Looking forward to another visit when the restrictions are lifted.,5,2020,09,07
202,Always feels like home - but more luxurious,"I have been to the Westin Dublin at least five times, and everytime it feels like coming back home - but more luxurious. The Westin Dublin convinces every time as the best hotel in Dublin to stay at, due to its excellent location, staff, facilities and food & beverage offerings. When you step into the hotel you are greeted by the beautiful Westin scent and the fireplace in the lobby is always on, giving it a cosy atmosphere. The Westin is most magical during Christmas! The rooms are clean, large and luxurious. You have everything you need, from a rainfall shower to the heavenly bed in which you will have a superb night's sleep!  I am looking forward to be back soon.",5,2020,09,07
202,Room with a View,"I arranged to stay at the Westin with my parents as they were making their first post lockdown trip to Dublin. I selected the Westin as I needed to be in the centre of the city and it was a great choice as we were literally in the centre point of the city (3 minutes‚Äô walk to Grafton Street).   

We arrived at 1 pm and it was no problem to get an early check in. I booked a gorgeous library suite for my parents as they deserved a special treat, I stayed in one of the roof top balcony rooms which each have private external decking area with soft chairs the most fantastic view of the city skyline, Trinity College and you can even see the Wicklow Mountains.

In terms of COVID guidelines, I could not fault the standards at which the hotel ensured the safety of their employees and guests, with social distancing, hand sanitizers at every turn and the complimentary travel sanitizers in our room.

Despite the restrictions, the Westin have worked hard to ensure the guests can still enjoy a relaxed experience. The option to enjoy our dessert and drinks in the wonderful Atrium lounge which has a pianist  was the perfect end to the night.",5,2020,09,06
202,Mrs,"Myself  and  my husband had a great night in this lovely  city centre  hotel. The room was really spacious  and  comfortable, the food was top notch, and the staff couldn't  be more helpful  and friendly. The Atrium was special with the piano playing and cheeseboard with our drinks. The man who did valet for our car was really chatty and friendly.  We hope to return  very soon. ",5,2020,09,06
202,Amazing Staff!!!!,"My mam and auntie stayed here for my mams birtbday. Im living in New Zealand & can't visit or send a present. So ordered them breakfast as a suprise & asked to leave a message.

My mam and auntie said all the staff were amazing and personable, loved the food and rooms sparkling clean. Also my interactions over email with this team was 5 Stars.",5,2020,09,06
202,Birthday celebrations üéâ ,I can‚Äôt fault this hotel from arrival to check out was exemplary.

This is our new favourite spot when staying in Dublin thank you Westin. ,5,2020,09,05
202,Great hotel for Dublin Break,"We stayed at the Westin overnight and could not have chosen a better hotel for location, service and overall experience. The room was fantastic, I used my Marriott Suite nights to upgrade and we stayed in the Grattan suite. The decor was luxurious and the King bed as comfy as ever (Westin hotels renowned for their beds) 
The staff we accommodating, breakfast was lovely and I only wish we had decided to have dinner at the Grill restaurant. 
It‚Äôs in a great location to wander around Dublin and avail of the many shops and restaurants. 

Looking forward to returning, thank you Westin Dublin!",5,2020,09,05
202,"Lovely Hotel, Great location","Very enjoyable stay here last night. Really fab location for shopping and exploring Dublin City, especially Grafton Street and Temple bar. 
Rooms are big and cozy. Also very quiet, can't hear any noise from the street. Seperate bath and shower. Check out staff were lovely. Front door staff very pleasant. Handgel and wipes supplied in the room and plentiful throughout the hotel.  Breakfast was lovely. Valet carparking a massive plus. Well worth considering for a staycation. Would love to revisit once restrictions have lifted some more. ",4,2020,09,04

202,Happy to be back,"I came back to this fantastic hotel after more than 2 years. A lot has changed since. Have to say I was very impressed by professionalism by everyone in the hotel. I have received an email with the Covid 19 measurements at the hotel at the beginning of the week when I have traveled.I found that information very useful and it helps to get prepared. 
Every member of staff was wearing a face mask (including bellman at the front door) and there is plenty of disinfection around the key points in the hotel. Check in was quick and easy without queuing and the room was spotless with more disinfection and wipes for personal use. Even the remote control was in plastic sleeve.
Would definitely stay again, had another great experience in Westin Dublin.",5,2020,09,01

202,Superb 14-night stay at the Westin Dublin!,"We truly had an exceptional 5-star experience at the Westin Dublin. We stayed for 14 nights and through such a long stay, every request was met with the utmost kindness and professionalism. It was our first hotel stay since Covid 19, and I instantly felt more relaxed when I saw the extensive safety protocols put into place.  Our two adjoining rooms were spacious and well appointed and gave us lovely views to Trinity College.  The hotel itself is ideally situated  and close to St. Stephen's Green, Temple Bar and many top sights. We also looked forward everyday to the amazing breakfast at the stylish Morelands Grill. The quality of the service at the Westin Dublin is unparalleled and while many hotels like this one are beautiful, I believe the care of the staff is what makes it stand out. We highly recommend the Westin Dublin and hope to return one day!",5,2020,08,31
202,Amazing time,Stayed at the westin for a night for a birthday and from start to finish the whole experience was amazing the staff are so friendly and so helpful when I enquired whether there was a bar we could have a drink at after our dinner he told me he had already booked a table for me which I thought was a great touch well worth a stay if you are coming to Dublin,5,2020,08,31

202,A fabulous stay !,"I stayed here for a night this week and throughly enjoyed the experience. I availed of their extremely generous healthcare hero offer which I was extremely appreciative of and touched at how my work is valued at the Westin hotel. 

We arrived at 1 pm to find that not only was our room ready, but we were offered an upgrade to a fabulous room with views overlooking 0‚Äô Connell street. 

In terms of COVID guidelines, I could not fault the standards at which the hotel ensured the safety of their employees and guests, with social distancing, hand sanitizers at every turn and the complimentary travel sanitizers in our room. 

Despite the confines of COVID restrictions, the Westin have worked hard to ensure the guests can still enjoy a relaxed experience. The option to enjoy our dessert in the wonderful atrium lounge was a lovely touch, where we could have a post dinner drink in a lovely relaxed setting was the perfect end to the night.

All the staff were very friendly and the lounge area is so beautiful! Breakfast was always lovely! the only negative is with our Marriott rate we usually get breakfast for ‚Ç¨5 but on check out this wasn‚Äôt the case it would be been nice to be told this at check in as they said they were not doing that rate anymore other than that it was a lovely stay and will be back again!,5,2020,08,28
202,5*,"I've been disillusioned with Irish hotels of late. I often wonder how some of them are awarded their star rating, when their product is so terrible. Two nights in The Westin and my faith in the Irish hotel industry has been renewed. From the moment we arrived at the front door, this was a five star experience. Unlike many of their competitors, who often have novices dealing with customers, the staff at The Westin were outstanding, clearly well trained and experienced. Nothing was too much trouble to them. The hotel is in immaculate condition and the room was very pleasant indeed. They said the bed would be comfortable, and I can confirm that it was! 
Well done to the management and staff, you're providing a true 5* 'experience'!
Highly recommend",5,2020,08,27
202,Can't wait to go back!,Myself and my boyfriend stayed here recently and it truly is a 5 star hotel. Every need was met and attended to immediately and we were treated like royalty.

Excellent location in the heart of the city, incredible service, professional friendly and knowledgeable staff, are all just some of the factors that combine to make a stay at the Westin Hotel a memorable experience.

The cherry on the cake for me is always the famous world renowned Westin Heavenly Bed. I challenge anyone to find a better sleep time experience at any other hotel. It really is a ‚Äúheavenly‚Äù experience.

The hotels hygiene and safety standards In place In particular during this time, are also second to none with great care taken to ensure guests are safe.

As always thanks to all the staff and concierge for making my stay a memorable one. Looking forward to my next visit.",5,2020,08,20
202,Fantastic stay at the Westin,I stayed in the Westin for one night and wow what an experience. The staff were so friendly and each one of them made me feel so welcome as soon as I entered the hotel. Straight away I noticed the safety measurements they had in place which made me more relaxed.

Breakfast was also very tasty. I have nothing but good things to say and will definitely be back soon!,5,2020,08,20

202,Dublin City visit ,"Planned a last minute weekend trip to the city at short notice. The Westin had a few good value offers and we choose it as we wanted to be in the centre of the city. The hotel is about 10 minutes‚Äô walk from Connolly station, so we were able to avoid taking a taxi.
 
We had made a few plans in advance and after a hassle free check in to a nice spacious airconditioned room we were ready to explore the city. The hotel is located in the centre point of the city so you can walk to all of the main attractions.
 
We had both been working quite intensively in recent months, so it was nice to be away as a treat.  As soon as we arrived, it was clear the city was taking all of the appropriate precautions and we felt safe.
 
We found that the majority of the city had reopened and although the shops were a little quieter than we had experienced we were able to explore at our leisure.  We had made dinner plans in advance and when we returned to the hotel we had dessert and drinks in the Atrium Piano lounge.  The staff were really pleasant and accommodating and arranged to pass a request on to the guy playing the piano. 
 
Breakfast was superb and we were able to order from a menu with a good few choices, we arranged a late check out and took the Luas to visit some college friends. It was a quick city visit which enabled us both to relax and to unwind.  We plan to return in September.",5,2020,08,18
202,An Amazing last night of my Staycation ,"Thanks to the team in The Westin Dublin for making my stay seamless, comfortable, and really enjoyable. I had been on The Shannon for 5 days and decided to treat ourselves to an overnight. I was so looking forward to it and everything exceeded my expectations. My junior suite was luxurious and probably the nicest hotel room that I have ever stayed in. ",5,2020,08,17
202,Fantastic experience,"Weekend one night stay at the Westin - we enjoyed every aspect, we really did get the 5 star experience. 
The room was spotless and adhered to Covid guidelines - the anti-bacterial wipes and hand gel In the room were a great idea. We will be booking again, as we felt safe and instantly at ease.
Thank you to all the staff in the Westin for your hard work through such strange times!",5,2020,08,17
202,Night away in our own city!,"Our stay at The Westin hotel was wonderful! The staff could not be more helpful, all measures in place to ensure safety but not anyway intrusive  for guests.
We upgraded to a heritage room for an extra ‚Ç¨30 included espresso machine robes and fridge. The mattress and pillows were exceptional!

The Atrium bar was open to guests and we returned there after a meal out . There was a small wedding party and wonderful piano playing in the bar. 
It was busy during the day but may have been a bit quiet that evening without the party.
We had drinks and a snack in the Bailey on Grafton street, a main course in the wonderful Vintage kitchen nearby and after a stroll around town then retired to the Atrium. An option to add a dessert at one of the later evening restaurants may suit  if you wanted to extend in evening.
We didn't dine at the hotel for breakfast as we saved ourselves for a lovely outside lunch after a spell of shopping, ( baggage stored at the hotel).
The Seamus Heaney: Listen Now Again  exhibition at the Bank of Ireland Cultural and Heritage Centre, is across the street.  It is free to visit and is open Monday to Friday, last visit 3.30. nice to do to add a bit of culture to your stay!
COVID 19 restrictions do impact on a trip to the city, masks in shops, loss of freedom to stop off for a drink at leisure but what is the alternative? Stay home and people don't work?
Get out enjoy thank you Westin!",5,2020,08,16
202,Great location and great hotel,"We stayed at this hotel (2 adults and 2 kids) a couple of days ago. The location is just perfect, so many things to do in within walking distance, we were able to pop in and out of the hotel everytime the kids were tired. We had 2 rooms(connected) both of them had hand sanitizers and wipes provided by hotel, they were beautiful and spotless as usual (we stayed here before). Even tough the city and the hotel were quieter than normal, the service was outstanding as usual, people in the front desk are always so helpful. I would highly recommend this hotel. Location is just unbeatable.",5,2020,08,15
202,Lovey stay,"The Staff and service was amazing.We stayed in room M6,we actually used this room as part of a shoot for a beauty product.

The room was modern and very clean.We will definitely be back again.

Big thank you to the Westin hotel.",5,2020,08,11
202,"Beautiful,elegant slice of heaven","My mother & i had the absolute pleasure of being able to stay for one night at The Westin on friday (7/8/20) due to a wonderful prize my mother had won for a mothers day competition they hosted on their facebook page. due to covid 19 our original date we intended to stay had to be put on hold for obvious reasons,but one thing i can definitely say is that it was definitely worth the wait! upon arrival the first thing we noticed was how elegant & beautiful the hotel was, they had plenty of hand sanitizers available throughout the hotel also. we were then greeted by a lovely gentlemen at the desk who checked us in and pointed us toward our room. after taking in the lovely window view of dublin city from our bedroom we got ready & headed for dinner. again when arrived for dinner we were greeted by very polite & lovely waiters who had my mother & i feeling like v.i.p's for the evening, after our dinner we were told we could enjoy our desert up in the Atrium lounge if we wished ,so without hesitation we made our way up to the lounge. well all i can say is WOW! when i first turned that curve in the staircase that lead to the lounge i was instantly greeted by one of the most peaceful, beautiful, heavenly views of The Atrium lounge. it was simply devine & felt like we had found a hidden gem in the middle of dublin city...infact you felt anywhere but in a busy dublin city it was the perfect escape. There was also this superb piano man playing music all evening throught out or desert & i couldn't help feel completely transported to a place of relaxation & peace. The Atrium definitely became an instant favourite of mine & A place I'd love to return too. The breakfast in the morning was absolutely delicious also. 
i really reccomened this beautiful little gem nestled into the heart of dublin city to anyone seeking an elegant,beautiful night away. From start to finnish we were treated like V.I.P's ,it was everything we imagined a 5 star to be & more",5,2020,08,09
202,Amazing Hotel,"Amazing Hotel. I was lucky to win an overnight stay in this Hotel. All I can say is from the moment we arrived we were made to feel very special and important. Our room was fantastic as was the food in the restaurant in the evening. To top the evening off we had a drink in The Atrium lounge which is stunning, the piano player added the finishing touches to what was already a fantastic evening. The following morning breakfast was superb  in the restaurant. We will not hesitate to reccomend  this Hotel to everyone. The staff are amazing and go over and beyond to make your stay so pleasant. They are a credit to the Hotel.",5,2020,08,08
202,Lovely stay,"I had a very pleasant stay at the Westin Dublin, as always. 

The staff was welcoming and very professional.

Very spacious, comfortable and well decorated room. Peaceful and restful.

I highly recommend the Westin Dublin.",5,2020,08,08
202,Excellent experience!,"My wife and I had an excellent stay at The Westin Dublin. We requested an early check-in, since our flight arrived at 6am, and we were checked into our room right away. The staff was incredibly friendly and helpful throughout our stay. The location of the hotel couldn't be much better. The interior decoration and furniture were tasteful and comfortable. I would recommend this stay to anyone visiting Dublin.",5,2020,08,05
202,Return visit to an old friend,"I was a bit apprehensive about staying in Dubln in the current crisis but I need not have been worried as I was at the Westin. It is my favourite hotel as the staff are all highly efficient and attentive, yet every one of them will welcome you back like an old friend ""Hello Miss _____, how have you been? Great to see you again. Oh you are staying with us, oh lovely"". I was even more impressed to see that as the full staff are not back yet, senior management were acting as concierges and other junior roles _ so many places now senior staff wouldn't dream of doing it because they are too full of themselves. I had a fantastic stay and I decided to treat myself as the prices are so low so booked the Grattan suite - everything is going to seem like a major come-down after that. The views of Trinity and Grafton Street were unbelievable - I didn't think you would have those kind of views as Dublin is so built-up around the Westin. The sitting room was lovely but the bedroom was fantastic - I had the best nights sleep in ages in the bed and it was so big I couldn't believe how I could stretch out (I'm 6').

I was trying to reconcile myself to this was a once-off (and failing miserably I might addp) and I went for a shower. There is a beautiful bath there but there is a separate shower with loads of room for a seat should you need it after a hard days shopping, and the best waterfall shower ever. Unbelievable water pressure to take the knots out of my back and the temperature was fabulous.

Everywhere you looked in the hotel there were sanitizers - they were left in front of the main door and the side door where the ramp is, each check-in point, tables around the hotel. In my room there was a sanitizer for my handbag and sanitising wipes provided and every single staff member who touched a glass, a bottle or whatever would sanitise their hands straight after before touching something else. If I called someone they would come over but before they touched anything, they would excuse themselves to sanitise their hands. I felt unsure about eating out with tables close together even with social distancing in some restaurants so ate in the hotel, where I had the most divine chicken wings ever and a beautifully cooked sirloin steak with no but of gristle or anything in it.

I was worried breakfast might be crowded so got breakfast in bed and enjoyed my views.

A fantastic stay (running out of superlatives here) but have arrived back with my perennial problem - I was trying to work out when I could go back on the way home.",5,2020,08,03
202,Date night away,"So Good To Be Back In Dublin City!!!!
After months of working at home and being away from the city myself and my fianc√© decided to arrange a night away in Dublin. We were lucky to secure a babysitter at short notice and made a break to the capital.  Our room reservation was very easy to arrange and the rate was very reasonable.  
We both highly recommended this hotel, the location is fabulous. There is actually no need to consider taxis as you can walk to all of the key places. The hotel staff were excellent and after many months of reduced business we thought that they were really lovely to deal with.  We had a large room with a king size bed and a great rooftop view over the city center. 
Before we arrived at the hotel we had a few concerns about whether it would be safe, it was reassuring to be greeted by the receptionist who explained all of the new safety measures and to have a spotless bedroom with mini sized pocket sanitizer for each of us to use.
Breakfast was really enjoyable, although the regular buffet is no longer available, we were given menus and all of our hot and cold items were served directly to us.  All in all it was a great night away, and we will definitely do it again soon.",5,2020,07,30
202,Wouldn‚Äôt stay anywhere else,"Great stay at the Westin, location is fantastic everything is super easy to walk to and from. All hotel staff operate at a high standard. 

The afternoon tea was up there with one of the best I have ever had, if you stay here this is a must! 

The bar in the evening had a really good live band it‚Äôs small and gets busy so get their early if you want a seat, we tried a number of cocktails and had some small plates there too, both were good, and at a price point you would expect for a decent hotel in a capital city. 

Breakfast was very good- decent selection, definitely get this included in your rate though because this is expensive if you pay and go. 

We also had lunch in the restaurant before we flew back, again faultless. 

The room itself was nice, it wasn‚Äôt noisy which we thought it might be, bathroom needs a bit of re-grouting none the less was nice and a good size with separate bath and shower.

So the reason I am giving this hotel a 4 and not a 5 was because the bed was tiny- very comfortable, I slept well but my much taller partner didn‚Äôt. It‚Äôs a queen bed, you could have had a king in there.",4,2020,06,28
202,Wonderful hotel,"Had a fantastic stay in this hotel. The location is brilliant and central to everything. Our twin room was luxurious and had a great bathroom with both bath and shower. Staff in the hotel were friendly and helpful especially the young man at concierge (I think his name was David ) who was so helpful in finding out and printing train times for us, thank you. Breakfast was a buffet of an excellent standard and we also treated ourselves to afternoon tea which was delicious. The only minor niggle we had was drinks, we were surprised that the Mint bar had neither raspberry or rhubarb gins. Also I asked for an expresso martini in the atrium bar but was told that they could not make these. Ii would have expected all of these to be available in a luxury hotel. 
An excellent stay and recommended for stays in Dublin",5,2020,03,12
202,Great Marriott property in the heart of Dublin,"This was trip #2 to Dublin. Being a Marriott loyalist, this was a natural choice the first time but I chose it again. It is a fantastic property in the heart of Dublin. It's a bit older, which gives it some charm and character. The room is spacious, as is the bathroom which has a big tub that I used on more than one occasion to relax after a hard day. The shower is nice, but I will say can get a little dicey when showering at the same time of day as multiple other guests - the water temperature can fluctuate wildly depending on who else is turning on or off their water at the same time.  The only other downside to the bathroom is lack of a traditional power outlet for the hair dryer, so using it in the closet was a bit weird but the mirrors and lighting were ok so I made it work.  I had a couple of room service deliveries. The food was good, hot and prompt and not too overpriced. There are multiple food delivery apps that will bring you just about any cuisine imaginable but they cannot deliver to your door so you need to go out to the street to get your food. Minor inconvenience if at all. 
In terms of location, you could not ask for more. It is just steps from the famous Temple Bar area, which has many options for dining and shopping, and a good sized Tesco market if you like having snacks on hand in your room (which the mini fridge accommodated very nicely). Every city attraction I visited was well within walking distance and bus lines are outside the door and easy to use.  ",5,2020,03,05
202,Disappointing Stay,"The room which I stayed in was a very nice room and was spacious. Very comfortable room and secure. Unfortunately service to guest did not match a 5 star hotel. At breakfast time waitress was not very pleasant and informed in a negative tone that restaurant would be shutting at 11a.m. I was there at 10.30a.m. as breakfast is stated to 11a.m. so I saw no reason why I couldn't proceed to have my breakfast without this negative reinforcement. 
Then I was just finished packing when at 12 my phone in room was ringing now I know 12 is check out and I was ready to checkout but surely there is 5 minutes grace time or so I could totally understand if it was very late.
Between breakfast and staying in the hotel I felt it was an in and out affair which is disappointing for guest relations and care especially in a 5 star hotel.
I am disappointed as location and room was very nice but unfortunately I would be reluctant to return.",3,2020,02,26
202,staff make a good hotel into a great hotel,"We were in Dublin for one night on arrival in Ireland from the United State on our way to an Irish dance competition in Killarney.  We had an assortment of odd situations we needed help with, from arriving before dawn (thanks to the overnight flights), to having medicine that needed refrigeration, and needing a place for the girls to practice.  On top of that, it was one of a series of unusually cold and rainy weekends (even for Ireland).  But thanks to the staff, particularly the folks at the front desk, who handled every one of our odd requests or questions with warmth and commitment to finding a way to solve whatever it was I put in front of them.  The highlight of this was when I asked them for help finding a corner of a meeting room or something where the girls could practice (there is a fitness room, which they used as well, but it was too small for any dance practice).  We expected a generic meeting room, but instead were lead to their gorgeous banquet room - a stunning room with glorious high ceilings, light, and tons of space.  I couldn't resist sending a few pictures back stateside to show them what the day's practice looked like!
Beyond the many elements of going above and beyond to support guests, the hotel itself is lovely.  The location is the real winner - walkable to almost anything and particularly close to most of the key sites.  The rooms were of the size and quality I would expect out of a Westin of this level and clean well appointed.  I would be more than happy to stay there again on future visits to Dublin - for either personal or business trips.",5,2020,02,24
202,Good hotel in great location ,"The hotel is close to College Green which is a very central location and only a few minutes walk from the bus stops for the airport buses. 

The hotel entrance is impressive with good door staff.  Reception staff were friendly and helpful. 

Rooms - We stayed over a weekend for a family birthday and had both ""Deluxe and ""Classic"" rooms. The Classic rooms overlook a central atrium that hosts a tea salon and bar. That tea salon also had a piano and the music could be heard in the room - but this was pleasant. Seperate bath and shower. The Classic room is hermetically sealed as the interior windows do not open. This proved to be too hot with insufficient air conditioning, it improved when we complained, but still too warm for really good sleep quality.

The Deluxe room had two external windows and was large. It was much cooler and provided better sleep quality. The bathroom was disappointing with only a bath shower combination - not as good as the bathroom in the Classic room.

Breakfast - In the Morelands Grill and very good but baked beans not available, however the Irish Yogarts and honey comb were wonderful. Restaurant staff are excellent. 

Would be happy to stay there again and recommend to others. 
",4,2020,02,22
202,Amazing Stay in the Heart of Dublin,"The Westin Dublin did not disappoint!  Our room was beautiful and the bed was extremely comfortable!!  The location of the Westin can‚Äôt be beat... it‚Äôs across the street from shopping, eating, Trinity University and the famed Fleet St/Temple Bar area.  Absolutely fantastic service and stay!",5,2020,02,17
202,Afternoon tea in the Atrium,"Delightful afternoon tea, we had  a very pleasant afternoon. Food was top notch and the crockery was just gorgeous. Numerous teas to choose from which were well described by staff. Beautiful setting and friendly, knowledgeable staff. Don't bother with any others, afternoon tea has to be here!",5,2020,02,17
202,Good hotel,"This was an enjoyable stay. Some issues when checking in due to the way Marriott seems to collect payment from British Airways holidays at the moment (something that happened in another hotel recently) but fortunately we knew how to sort it. 

The room faced the street and was large enough to take a king size bed but had a queen. Bathroom would benefit from renovation, the floor tiles were past their best due to old grouting but the room was very clean and well decorated.

Food and drink was excellent throughout our stay. We visited the bar on Saturday evening and had several cocktails whilst listening to some excellent live music. Afternoon tea was equally good in the Atrium as was the service. The William Edwards crockery was a nice touch. Breakfast offers a strong selection of buffet plus cooked options available. We had lunch one day in the Morelands Grill which again was of a good quality. 

The hotel has an excellent location. We were able to walk to all the main attractions of Dublin easily.

202,5* service by a very dedicated employee ,"I attended a  business meeting in the Westin on Tuesday, 11 February.
As I am a celiac I have to be very careful with my diet. During the course of the day, I asked a member of the staff, Chloe, for some fruit. She arrived with fruit & gluten free brownies.I couldn‚Äôt thank Chloe enough for being so thoughtful. 
the westin should be very proud of Chloe‚Äôs actions,",5,2020,02,13
202,"Fantastic Hotel, Outstanding Service, Great Rooms","I've stayed here three times and they keep improving. Truly Five Star Service, they always seem to anticipate your needs before you do. The rooms are spotless and quiet (even given the proximity to the trains, buses & Temple Bar). The Beds are a Luxury Experience. The Atrium is a sanctuary and a great place to work or take afternoon tea. The Restaurant and the bar both have good food and would be suitable to host clients. It's also a modern hotel.",5,2020,02,11
202,Great stays at the Westin,"Initially planned to stay one night at the Westin.  Enjoyed it so much cancelled another hotel and stayed at the Westin a second night, for our last night in Ireland.  We were in Ireland to spend a week in County Wicklow, an hour and a half south of Dublin.  We stayed in Dublin our first day and night and our last day day and night.  The Westin is in the perfect location for those that want to visit Dublin. In addition, the staff are excellent, and the rooms are large and well appointed with very comfortable beds.  Breakfast in the morning was very good.  We took the AirCoach bus from and to the airport.  The AirCoach bus drops you off on O'Connell Bridge about a 3 and 4 minute walk to the hotel. And the return bus to the airport is just across the street from the hotel. The heart of Dublin is at your footsteps.",5,2020,02,08
202,Excellent stay at The Westin Dublin!,We stayed at the Westin Dublin last week for 4 nights.  The staff couldn't be more friendly and accommodating!  Shauna at the front desk was just wonderful to us.  Alan at the front door was a gem and took good care of us.  The hotel is very nice and the room was a good size.  The location is prime as it is right next to Trinity College and across from Temple Bar area. We will be back!,5,2020,02,06
202,Newly Renovated and Charming,"We had a room in the newly renovated wing of the hotel.  You could almost smell the new paint.  Rooms were very well decorated.  Bathrooms were well lit with gorgeous marble.  We were very comfortable.  The hotel doesn't feel like it's part of a chain.  It has so much of its own charm, fireplaces, sitting nooks, and a few places to eat and drink.  The bar, which I believe was an old vault was extremely well decorated and lit and quite large.  We had a great time sitting there for a few drinks.  We had brunch tea on the second floor underneath the skylight.  We also had dinner at the main restaurant, very upscale and delicious.  We had a great first night in Ireland here.  Valet was extremely convenient as well.  Not sure if they have a gym or spa.  Concierge was very helpful.",5,2020,02,05
202,This is truly a home away from home,"In many ways the Westin hotel can be called one of Dublin‚Äôs hidden gems, what was once a bank has been renovated into a hotel of pure luxury and relaxation.

From the Mint bar which lies in the basement has to be the go to bar for anyone who has fond memories of reading the Harry Potter books as it strongly resembles the common room of the Slytherin house and while your down there you would be foolish not to try their amazing ‚ÄòSmokin Gun‚Äô drink as it would put hairs on any mans chest.

The Atrium, without a shadow of a doubt is the place in Dublin to sit back, relax and enjoy a macaroon or two with one ( or two ) bottle(s) of wine while letting the world go by as you sit in your own bubble of peace and relaxation.

The Moreland grill is a restaurant that gives you a samples of what heaven would taste like. From the amazing breakfast that sets you up for the day, to the truly scrumptious lunch and dinner that would leave any food connoisseur happy let alone     any sommeliers dream come true with the wines that they have for you to try. Leaving the Moreland grill at the end of my meal can be one of great difficulty as I just want to keep eating till I explode.

Last but certainly not least are the staff that keep the Westin going like a well oiled wheel. The staff in the Westin from the humorous front of house staff to the waiters and exceptional bartenders are in many ways one of the best in the country, they are  ones of efficiency, great conversation and sometimes quite the gymnasts as they jump from guest to guest with great conversation and services to the highest of quality.",5,2020,02,05
202,Gorgeous‚Äô,"Delight to return to the Westin! 
Very warm welcome from all the team at the check in from the concierge to the receptionist. 
The room was stunning, beautifully appointed. 
Steven the concierge was oh so helpful! 
Went down in the evening to the atrium, it‚Äôs just so pretty‚Äô 

The went to see the dining options downstairs and was greeted by a very rude and discourteous Host called Greg! We decided not to dine in Moreland‚Äôs Grill as a result! 

We went and ate in the bar downstairs which was very busy and hard a good atmosphere.
The food was very tasty, one thing the chips were not fully cooked through! 
When brought to staffs attention it was resolved straight away‚Äô 

All in all this is a suburb hotel and I love to return again and again.",4,2020,01,28
202,Great hotel in a great location,"Stayed here on a weekend in Dublin.  The location is right in the heart of Dublin.  You can walk everywhere you need to go, grab the light rail with a stop close by, and the buses all run right by there.  I picked this hotel because of the other reviews saying it was luxurious and they are correct.  The staff is excellent and very helpful.  The room was top notch.  sheets were very high thread count.  bathroom was all new and the shower was excellent.  the room was pretty quiet even though I faced O'Connell Street.  I'd highly recommend this hotel if you want to be centrally located and not afraid to pay a little more for it.  The restaurant was excellent and the staff there was outstanding.  5 stars all around.",5,2020,01,27
202,Lovely Afternoon Tea! ,"I recently enjoyed afternoon tea in the Westin's Atrium Lounge for a birthday celebration for four. Our experience began the moment we entered the door as were greeted by a friendly doorman and concierge, who pointed us to the atrium lounge. The atrium is a beautiful, spacious hidden gem in the heart of Dublin! Nichola, our server was very pleasant and attentive to our needs! Our teas/coffees came out quickly, along with our glasses of prosecco which was included in our package. The food was beautifully presented on two stands (one 3-tier stand per two people) and even more, the food was delicious!!! We took our time and sat in the atrium for a few hours, without feeling any pressure to rush or leave, throughout we were consistently offered more tea and coffee. Overall it was a fabulous experience which I would highly recommend and I definitely hope to return again! The service was excellent with special thanks to Owee for facilitating our visit and Nichola, our server. ",5,2020,01,27
202,Nice hotel,Stayed for one night. Check in was the best and professional! No issues. Bathrooms was amazing - spacious and with good lighting and mirrors. I loved the Christmas decorations too. Mint bar was nice but a little expensive.,5,2020,01,24
202,"Wonderful Hotel, Staff Amazing! Location, Location, Location!","We stayed at this hotel for 2 nights, before the start of our tour and afterwards for one day on.  The bed is so comfortable, its like sleeping in a cloud!  Very easy check in and the staff were so lovely and kind.  I really enjoyed this hotel.  Their breakfast buffet was top-notch.  The location is excellent for touring Trinity College and the surrounding areas.  Go to Temple Bar area and enjoy the pubs.  The Palace Bar is right near by, it is a MUST!!!!  sit in the back room and take in the atmosphere.  Love Dublin, was sad to leave.  I'll be back!!",5,2020,01,22
202,Excellent ,"I stayed two nights here and was welcomed by a very friendly smiling concierge, check in was equally warm and welcoming, I was upgraded to a beautiful room, clean, quiet and the super comfortable bed resulted in a fabulous sleep. I had dinner at the Moorlands Grill which was excellent. Service and food to an extremely high standard, in fact so good, rather than try a restaurant away from the hotel, ate in again on the second night and it did not disappoint. Breakfast was a real treat with plenty of choice, the pastries were fabulous! All the staff were impeccably dressed, well groomed and certainly seemed to enjoy their jobs, always a smile and helpful. I look forward to returning to the Westin next time I‚Äôm in Dublin, I almost forgot to mention how well located it is being just a five minute walk from the city centre. ",5,2020,01,19
202,The Best Hotel In City Centre Dublin,"I would definitely return to this hotel for either short or long-term stay. It is directly next to the famous Trinity College. The hotel is in walking distance to The Dublin Castle. The eatery T.G.I.Friday is directly across the street, along with Starbucks. Theatres and cathedrals are also very close. I was there for Christmas and the hotel warmly pulled in its guests to assure everyone would enjoy the holiday. It was an exquisite experience!",5,2020,01,11
202,Top class.....great hotel.,"This was a class hotel from start to finish. Booked two rooms for parents and ourselves. They loved it. Location they say is everything, it is here, but you also get a fab hotel in the heart of Dublin. Out the front door, O'Connell St, Grafton St. to the left. Have to mention Bowes pub around the corner too!!!! (Best Guinness ever)
Checkin was easy,  I parked in Fleet St carpark, as the others went into the hotel.
The Mint Bar was busy as it was the weekend before Christmas.Had meat and cheese platters the afternoon we arrived, and they were excellent with a few drinks.
Rooms very comfortable and views internally of a courtyard type room down stairs. 
What we said about the breakfast, was that we were only staying one night, you could have a different breakfast for many days, as there was plenty of choice.
Staff were excellent throughout.
We will be back.",5,2020,01,09
202,"Wonderful stay, awesome location","I‚Äôve just returned from my stay at the Westin and I cannot recommend it enough. The rooms were comfortable, stylish (we had a view right to Trinity College) and well kept. We loved the Christmas decorations and cozy fireplaces in the lobby, and the staff were all so pleasant. Patrick at the Concierge desk was wonderful and provided us with many excellent recommendations that really made our trip. You are walking distance to everything (really) so this location can‚Äôt be beat. I hope I will get to visit again in the future‚Äî thanks for a great time!",5,2020,01,08
202,Terrible,"We go to Dublin every year and we thought we would try the Westin. Breakfast  was terrible but the room was a real problem. We were in a renovated room in the new part but the AC did not work and the room had no air. What was worst is the plumbing. The shower would flood and then the toilet outlet would flood the bath..... the noise from the plumbing was terrible. We politely told the manager and got a bottle of cheap red and a note. The next 2 days we had the same problem and nothing was done. I left my number for a manager to call me but I am still waiting for a call.  

No room service as  too busy and our floor had not been vacuumed the whole week we were there.

I would really not recommend the area other- its in the scummy part of the city and just not a nice hotel. Too many Faulty Tower moments but the issues with the AC, bathroom and terrible food were just awful.",1,2020,01,06
202,Great location and very comfortable but...,"Stayed here for work on a last minute business trip. Rooms were great and location is really great. Beds were super comfortable and the rooms are well appointed. The bathroom was nice although a bit dated.

However I arrived at 1pm and I could not get into the hotel until 3pm.  That‚Äôs fine. Hotels are booked. But I sat patiently in the lobby nodding off while I waited for my room. I was sitting directly in front of the desk, not able to be missed. Yet I had to ask the desk three times if my room was ready. Finally on the third time, the same woman asked me my name-which I would have expected her to know by now- and said ‚Äúoh are you waiting for your room? i think it might be ready now.‚Äù. Might!?!  I‚Äôm half asleep in the chair in front of you. How clueless can you be?

Because I was only in town for three nights and I had my stuff all spread out over the room I specifically asked them not to come into my room. But they did anyway. I don‚Äôt need someone to make my bed for me. I really don‚Äôt like people being in my room unless there is an need for them to be. 

Also when I checked in, I asked if breakfast was included in my rate. They said it was not but that if I prepaid it would be ~¬£20 euro as opposed to much more if I paid by the day.  That‚Äôs fine except that they didn‚Äôt also explain that i was prepaying for every day i was staying even though i explicitly asked if it would apply to the last day when I was leaving at 4am. It was really as if the front desk was just out to lunch. 

Then the final surprise! I got home to find out that they charged me for the daily breakfast *and* the day by day breakfast for the two days I had breakfast. So I had to call the hotel *in Dublin* to get it cleared up. But of course the credit takes two weeks to show up. So now your expense report is all messed up. 

I really don‚Äôt like having to do other people‚Äôs jobs for them. That is the problem here.

202,A very nice Festive stay,"We enjoyed a super stay on Stephens Day, a very relaxing festive atmosphere with excellent service.
Breakfast was superb and the bar staff in the Mint bar were great, a stunning hotel I had walked by many times but never been inside, the atrium was so chilled for an afternoon tea.
Nice gym plenty to work with for a good training session.
Thanks very much",5,2020,01,05
202,Wonderful Staff and Location!!!,"Highly recommended this hotel. Location was fabulous.  Each time we took an Uber the driver would comment that we were in the best location.  Could walk to many places.  Staff was excellent.  Extremely pleasant and helpful.  One night my husband and I wanted to have some dessert after dinner and we went to the main restaurant.  The host was very welcoming and even told us we could also consider the Atrium in the hotel.  When we weren't sure where it was she actually walked us to it.  She was very gracious and said we could have dessert in either place.  We chose the Atrium b/c it's lovely. Sat by the fire and had delicious desserts.  It became out nightly tradition.  What a nice ending to wonderful days in Dublin.  Thanks Westin for such a great experience. (PS - we had a slight problem in our bathroom and I don't think I've ever had an issue fixed so quickly in a hotel.  Excellent service).  On travels back to Dublin, we will definitely stay here.",5,2020,01,05
202,Fantastic Hotel in Fantastic Location,We were ini Dublin for Christmas and this hotel was the perfect place to celebrate!  It was beautifully decorated and the staff were all so friendly and helpful.  Our room was lovely and extremely comfortable.  We had a great view of the Temple Bar area; fun to watch when we were in the room.  Breakfast is amazing and the Mint Bar is an excellent place to visit in the evening.  Their cocktails are amazing and the live music is really good.  If we ever get back to Dublin we will be staying at the Westin!  ,5,2020,01,04
202,terrible experience,"Overcharged 80 euro for a valet we never used and 4 breakfasts despite me and my girlfriend only staying 1 night.  Rang and emailed hotel 10 times. Always promised a call back that never happens. No joy getting a refund, Terrible customer service.",1,2020,01,03
202,Fabulous,"We stayed here on New Years Eve. Although it was very busy the staff were amazing and we had the most beautiful suite, my only disappointment was we could only stay for one night .  This is our Favourite Dublin hotel.  Also very central and convenient ... brilliant breakfast as well. ",5,2020,01,03
202,Close to everything without being in the middle of it,"The hotel is well located just outside the temple bar area, making it very convenient to explore Dublin, and at the same time provide the quiet and amenities expected from a 5-star hotel.
The check-in/out was easy. We got a room upgrade upon check in. The room was spacious, plush bedding, and nice toiletries. Staff were attentive. Breakfast is excellent, and well worth including in your stay, with plenty of choices (both healthy and hearty). 
There is a lovely atrium, perfect for afternoon tea, or relaxing with a beverage before heading out. The bar downstairs, on the other hand, is lively, with great variety of spirits and cocktails - perfect to escape the super busy temple bar area, but still with enough buzz and ambience.",5,2020,01,01
202,Perfect location for city break,"Myself and my husband stayed here on Saturday 21st Dec. We live in Dublin but this was a chance to have a break without children. This hotel is in the perfect location to see all of what Dublin has to offer, everything is within 5-10 min walk away. The hotel itself is beautiful, even more so with the Christmas decorations. We booked a table in the Mint Bar and the live music and cocktails were amazing. The room was great size, bed was extremely comfortable. The decor was very modern, clean and fresh.
Lovely touch of lavender oil beside the bed too. 
Lovely choice for breakfast too, good wide range good quality. 
The reception staff were very pleasant, we were given a room upgrade too which we were delighted with. 
All in all the next chance we get we will be back.",5,2019,12,28
202,Fab-u-luss ,"A wonderful hotel in the perfect location for visiting the city. A very warm welcome, excellent room, very friendly and efficient staff. We had a simply wonderful time. 
The bed was extremely comfortable. 
The breakfast was first class. ",5,2019,12,26
202,Very excellent experience,"The hotel is really clean and very organized. The rooms seemed a little dark- having experienced two rooms within the same trip, but all, after all, a very excellent experience. I dropped my phone while running to catch a cab outside the hotel, luckily the doorman knew the taxi driver and called him right after we left, so we turned around and he handed me the phone. So extra points for security and customer service!",5,2019,12,16
202,The atrium,We had afternoon tea at the atrium. Lovely. Staff friendly. Very relaxing. I sometimes meet friends there for drinks.there is a lovely atmosphere there. The hotel is right in the heart of Dublin city. ,5,2019,12,11
202,Family reunion,"Members of the family from Canada, Harrogate, London and Longford met for the weekend. Hotel was central to everything we wanted to do. All staff were very helpful, room was lovely and breakfast was good.",5,2019,12,06
202,Awesome location,"This is the best location in Dublin...minutes from Temple Bar districts, from shopping districts, from Trinity College; I was traveling with my two children and it is so important for them to take rest throughout the day.  We were able to rest a little here and there in the hotel, and then walked to Trinity College; rest in the hotel again, then walked to Temple Bar districts; during our 4 days in Dublin, we walked around town and Westin offers the best location in town.  there is a bus station few mins walk which took us between the hotel and the airport.  The service is amazing by the way.  The gym, however, had few broken equipments and the bathroom amenities/tea bags were not refilled daily.  I ran out of shampoo by the 3rd day and I had to call them to deliver some new one.  But these are minor issues....I would definitely return to this hotel again due to its location and its friendly staffs.  ",5,2019,12,04
202,A truly wonderful experience ,"This hotel is in a prime location and cannot be beaten for its proximity to all of the historic Dublin sites. From the moment we walked in, we felt welcome and the staff were beyond friendly. Just to mention that Wesley was so nice when checking in.

Unfortunately, we did not get the chance to enjoy The Atrium, but what we did thoroughly enjoy was Morelands Grill.

We were served by the lovely Emiliano who gave us exceptional service throughout the evening. We would especially like to thank Greg who made us laugh so much and gave us a great Irish welcome. What a lovely manner and personality.

All in all, The Westin is an outstanding hotel. Totally recommended. Congratulations to the staff.",5,2019,12,03
202,Exemplary,A little on the pricey side even for us medical graduatesüò∑üò∑üò∑. There's no complaints from my side after sampling chefs oua da grais. A triumph of the taste buds that left my morphea adeas trembling for more. Bravo,5,2019,12,02
202,Fell short of 5 star experience,"This is my 3rd visit to The Westin in Dublin.  I have reviewed this hotel before (Nov 18) where i gave it 5 starts but unfortunately, this visit fell well short of what a 5 star hotel should be delivering.   Upon arrival, I received a frosty check-in experience from the lady on the desk, who did not recognise the loyalty level connected with the booking.  I would have thought this would be standard for a Titanium Elite member with 116 nights this year so far.   In fairness she did change the room type from a queen to a twin as requested.  I was not offered points/free gift or complimentary breakfast.   I queried about breakfast and was quite rudely told this would be charged.  After some discussion with the lady and pointing out that on previous occasions and in other Marriott locations in Ireland and globally where club lounge is not available that breakfast has always been complimentary.   Eventually she agreed that breakfast would be complimentary but this was a very poor start to our stay.    When we returned and collected our key we received a warm welcome from Thomas who recognised the loyalty level, thanked us and advised that breakfast was complimentary.

We had dinner booked for 7.45 in the Moorlands Grill.   Service fell significantly short of a 5 star property with delays all the way through from waiting  to order to getting the bill.  We acknowledge that the restaurant was extremely busy however there should be sufficient staff available to deliver the appropriate service.   We were seated at 7,45 we waited a long time to order and there was a big delay between starter and main course, we were eventually served our main course at 9.10.   I had to request a dessert menu as we would appear to have been forgotten at this stage, where our empty dinner plates sat without being removed for at least 15 minutes.    Again once we ordered dessert we had a lengthy wait and had to remind the waiter that we had not received our dessert.  That being said our food was very good when it arrived.   The staff appeared to be under severe pressure and at one stage a senior member of staff was heard using foul language to a junior member.  This really is not good enough.

As previously mentioned we did get our room changed to a twin room which we are thankful for.   The room was spacious and 2 very comfortable beds.   There was a balcony attached to the room and upon stepping out this morning it was extremely disappointing to find  a disposable cup full of cigarette butts on one of the wicker chairs.

Breakfast was very good, pleasant staff good choice of food.

Check out was good - same lady checked me out that checked me in.   I did mention to her about the poor service in the restaurant and she acknowledged that the restaurant was fully booked last night but she did comment a 5 star hotel should be able to offer 5 star service consistently.

Would i return - Yes i would, and hopefully will never have to encounter this situation again.   It is a fabulous hotel and location is ideal.",2,2019,12,01
202,Thoroughly enjoyable stay,"We recently spent a night at this excellent hotel right in the centre of Dublin. It cant be beaten for location, with beautiful rooms, delicious food and the most helpful and professional staff led by manager Eamonn Casey whose incredible attention to detail makes this property such a special place to visit and stay in. You wont be disappointed if you choose to stay here.",5,2019,11,29
202,Great hotel sooo close to Central Dublin,"Came for business but this place made it feel like I was on an Irish vacay!

Step outside the doors, cross the street and you are smack in the middle of Temple Bar area. Go left or right and have your choosing of being in the Grafton Quarter or along the River. 

Other than being a beautiful Marriott property, this such a great place to stay at whether you are visiting for business or pleasure. 

Great restaurant and bar inside, comfortable rooms with great amenities and world class service by all the staff. I love coming Dublin and certainly plan on staying here next time.",5,2019,11,28
202,Very good and excellent location,"Professional staff, good service. Excellent breakfast in lovely setting at the Moreland Grill. Nice fresh juices and tea in the atrium. Appreciated the early check in requested in advance. Very comfortable beds and pillows‚Äîmy room was quite large (mobility challenged room?). Room is getting a little worn but still very comfortable. ",4,2019,11,26
202,In the Middle of it all,My stay at the Westin was excellent. It‚Äôs easy to walk to all the sites. The service was excellent. The Mint Bar was very cool. Temple Bar District and Trinity College is right across the street. Lots of restaurants in the area. When in Dublin Westin is the place to stay. ,5,2019,11,24
202,One night staycation in my own city. ,"What a gorgeous treat, one night in this incredible location. The staff were warm, friendly and just the right amount of chatty. Classic oysters and champagne are a must! The champagne sat on a sustainable and reusable drip mat! 

A great room with gorgeous linen. ",5,2019,11,24
202,Delightful stay!,"My family and I just competed a 3 night stay at The Westin and had an excellent experience! From check-in to check-out, the staff were courteous and helpful. The hotel is located in a terrific location, just steps from some of Dublin's most iconic sites, including Trinity College, Temple Bar, and several national galleries and museums. The hotel blends old charm with modern sophistication, and we found the holiday decorations to add extra warmth. I'd like to extend my sincere thanks to Niamh and Marcos at the front desk who were very hospitable. We look forward to our return visit!",5,2019,11,20
202,Beautiful!,"Attended here for a wedding on a day with torrential rain.  Everything was beautiful, the food the service, the surroundings, everything was absolutely perfect.  The staff were very helpful. The location is perfect too, right in Centre of Dublin City.",5,2019,11,18
202,Stunning facility but atrocious customer service,"This hotel is so pretty, the bar is amazing and the room was fantastic, but we had the absolute worst experience here.  As a Bonvoy member, I had booked a regular room but decided to UPGRADE our room (both online with the hotel, not a third party website) prior to our trip to have a better experience, and requested an early check-in with my reservation (our friends received an early check-in, so it was possible.)  While I understand this cannot be guaranteed, upon arrival at 10am we were told the room was being prepared and it would be ready shortly. I asked if it would be one hour or two hours (we simply wanted a power nap after our overnight flight.) She said two hours. To keep this brief, after 3.5 hours I asked her why she had said two hours and she denied saying it, was incredibly rude and dismissive basically turned her back on us.    I received a text a full 6 hours after arriving that our room was ready.  She set an absolute awful tone for our arrival by blatantly misleading us - we really could not believe it. Additionally, as a Bonvoy member, I was never offered a check-in gift, enhanced wi-fi, or whether an upgrade was available or not.  Very disappointing. However, I will give the hotel great marks for the quality of the bed, the location, and the facility itself.",2,2019,11,18
202,Having Dinner in Moreland Grill,A very good service from this restaurant by Caroline and GREG the host for the night. I have been greeted on arrival and be seated at a properly set table. Very friendly and attentive whenever help is needed from the table.,5,2019,11,09
202,Dinner at Moreland Grill,"Everything was perfect. Food was delicious amazing and of course the staffs was so friendly. ‚ÄúGREG‚Äù is the host with the most and ‚ÄúCAROLINE‚Äù is attentive, so smiley and quick. Should be a model to the other staffs.",4,2019,11,09
202,Atrium amazing space,"Aoife and Vera in the Atrium Welcomed us and made us the most beautiful cocktails service is second to none smiley and ever so helpful staff, loved the fireplace and music very cosy space ambiance is perfect",5,2019,11,09
202,Excellent Location at a Beautiful Hotel,"This location couldn‚Äôt be better in the heart of the city, a very easy walk to everything.  The Atrium had a exquisite afternoon tea.  The service by every staff member in the hotel was 5 star.  The hotel itself is beautiful and welcoming.  This is top level experience that is well worth the rate.   You will not be disappointed.  This is now my new go to hotel in Dublin. ",5,2019,11,09
202,Best Hotel in Dublin,"Accessible rooms are the best we have stayed in throughout Europe . What makes this hotel standout from other 5 star hotels in Dublin is the staff who will go out of their way to help .Special mention to Se√°n the front desk manager , he knows what excellent customer service is . The location is great , so convenient. Our only disappointment was the quality of food and service at breakfast. Dinner in the grill is excellent.",5,2019,11,08
202,A Perfect Trip!,"The Westin Dublin is an incredible hotel located right next to Trinity College and across the street from one of the main areas with plenty of restaurants and pubs.  The hotel is beautiful, incredibly clean and the staff are beyond amazing!   We arrived early and delighted to hear Jane say, """"your room is ready and we upgraded you.""  Kenneth and Patrick at the concierge were outstanding in providing information on tours and restaurants and made all of our reservations. Every suggestion was perfect ... The Bank, The Old Smokehouse and Shanahan's. The tour to the Cliff of Mohers is a must!   Special thanks to Kenneth for arranging reserved seats on the bus tour. Stephen, the doorman was a delight and welcomed us with a smile, great suggestions and wonderful conversation. The gym had plenty of equipment and was also very clean.  I absolutely recommend this hotel for anyone considering a visit to Dublin.",5,2019,11,06
202,Wow!,"I don't often get to stay in a top class hotel so I really enjoyed my one night stay in The Westin recently. Everything from check in to check out was handled very professionally. The staff were very friendly. 
The rooms are superb and we had a lovely view of Trinity College to admire. For a city centre hotel it was great that the external noise level was kept to a minimum and a good nights sleep was assured. The bathroom was really elegant and well fitted out. Everything worked like it should in a top class establishment and we really enjoyed the luxurious feel. 
To top it all off, there was an excellent buffet style breakfast with a wide range of options which really set us off to a great start for a day in the capital.",5,2019,11,06
202,"Lovely hotel, service could be better ","Love this hotel and have stayed here a few times. Rooms are incredibly comfortable, consistent with Westin ‚Äòheavenly‚Äô standards. The hotel itself is beautiful, with classic decor and comfortable furnishings. Location can‚Äôt be beat, truly in the center of all the action and especially great if you‚Äôre a tourist. I was dissatisfied with the lack of friendly service on this particular stay. 

The staff in the breakfast room weren‚Äôt particularly friendly. For example they didn‚Äôt want to explain the menu to hen I asked and I waited for a while for coffee and the waitress didn‚Äôt pour the first cup. 

One Wednesday evening I had a drink in the mezzanine lounge which was not busy  and the server was no where to be found. Finally he came out from the kitchen to take my drink order but not a smile in sight. Looked like he‚Äôd rather be anywhere else! Left me and my friend alone for ages and only came to check on us at 10pm to let us know they were closing and could we pay for our drinks. Would have been nice to have been checked on earlier and offered another. BTW, he took payment but didn‚Äôt clear our glasses! The details matter. ",4,2019,10,30
202,Perfect Location,"We loved our stay! Beautiful hotel, nice room, and great location. We loved being able to walk to multiple neighborhoods. It was nice being next to Trinity College and walking distance to St Stephen‚Äôs Park. ",5,2019,10,28
202,Slightly slipping in standard - but still good,"My second time staying in the last year - great location and very welcoming and will to accomadate an upgrade if possible 

It has a lovely athmosphere and spacious rooms with good size en-suites 

However the breakfast was most disappointing- an occasion you look forward to - on Sunday we got day old patisseries - processed orange juice and frankly cold buffets of sausages etc 

I complained- it was very casually handled - the bowls were full and he simply the manager turned up the heat - it would have taken quite a while for all to heat up and 12 more dissatisfied customers passed in the interim 

This was the 2nd time I saw the manager turned the heat up - he knew the food was cold and failed to replace - 

There is no excuse for slightly fresh patisseries - not touched - processed orange juice in a 5 star hotel

Standards are slipping and look for forward to my next trip where I hope matters are addressed",3,2019,10,28
202,Disappointing!,"We chose the Westin Dublin as our last stop on our Ireland trip celebrating our 30th wedding anniversary because it looked elegant & well appointed and was in a great location. Upon arrival we were pleased with the friendly doorman, pleasant check-in and lovely lobby area. But after this disappointment set in.

As a lifetime elite Bonvoy member, we decided to use points for this stay. At check in the gal told us that she had moved us to a room on the 4th floor that would be great & quiet.  I think what she was really telling us is that she moved us to the worse room in the hotel because we were using points!

When we opened the door to our room were were a little confused to see a bathroom to our right (which was very nice) and a set of stairs in front of us.  As we went up the stairs we were surprised to see the least spacious room we have ever stayed in.  But the worse part is the room DID NOT HAVE A WINDOW!!!  Above head level in the corner of the room was a tiny glass opening shaped somewhat like a bottomless 3-leaf clover. It had beautiful drapes hanging on each side like it was supposed to be a real window!  I have never felt so claustrophobic in my life!  Although there was a skylight above a small alcove in the room, the room was dark and had inadequate lighting making trying to read anything very difficult. Even though the bed itself was comfortable, sleeping was not due to the claustrophobic nature of the room.

The Dublin Westin was a disappointment as our room was nothing like even the most basic rooms pictured on the website. We did not expect to get a suite, but basic expectations would be that one would get a room with a window you could actually see out of and would provide natural light to the room. Our room at the Dublin Westin became merely a place to try and sleep and not a place to enjoy or relax in. 

With  488 nights stayed in Marriott hotels, one develops a certain level of standards of what to expect at various types of properties. In this case, we really feel like we wasted our points at this hotel and our points/and or $ would have been better spent at another hotel.  We did politely mention our displeasure at check out but the gal was indifferent to our comments.",2,2019,10,27
202,Couldn‚Äôt of ask for more!,"From the moment we first walked in everything was first class. When they found out it was our 25th wedding anniversary they sent up a complementary dessert. Room spacious, bathroom luxurious, exceptionally clean. Bed so comfortable. Right next to trinity college, central for all local attractions. Will definitely be going back and wouldn‚Äôt hesitate to recommend.",5,2019,10,27
202,Best Location - Some Staff Training Can Be Done,"When we checked in, they said they 'upgraded' us to a similar room but one that had been renovated.  It looked nice but..... was on the Mezzanine floor, had no bathtub and had the closet in the wall by the bed instead of by the door.  We went back downstairs and asked for a non-renovated room which we thought was much better.

The room was good, amenities in the bathroom were good, the bed was good and the size was good.  Higher floor than the mezzanine floor so the view from the room was better.  The sleep was excellent.

Had dinner at Morelands Grill.  The room is nice.  We went on Steak Special Night.  The steaks were thin.  I was hoping for a nice thick juicy one so was disappointed.  Went for a drink one night in the Mint Bar on Gin Night.  Sat at a table for about 15 minutes before the waiter came by and apologized for not seeing us even though he served a table about 3 tables away along the same wall.  Watch out for Gin and Tonics in Ireland.  They charge for the Gin and then they charge for the tonic.  Double dipping I say especially on Gin Night when they should have had specials.

Breakfast selection.  Had a good selection.  Did not like the unsmiling hostess whose first words are 'room number' every day for a week.  Not a good start to the day.  They are slow at clearing plates so they pile up.

Concierge service was good.  

The location is fantastic.  Restaurant tip.  The good restaurants near the hotel, no matter what day, are a bit small and crowded so make sure you get reservations.  Great walks to different areas on both sides of the river.  Some tweaking on the service but not serious.  Overall, the hotel was a nice stay and we would stay there again.... but not in a renovated room if it did not have a tub.",4,2019,10,24
202,Great Hotel,This Westin is a great hotel! It is perfectly located in the center of Dublin and it is near everything. You have Trinity College and Fleet Street nearby.

Can't say enough nice things about the professional, yet always friendly, staff at the hotel.

202,"Classy hotel, great location ","Stayed at this hotel for a few days on my first visit to Irlande.  The hotel is very nice, 4 to 5 star service.  Entrance, lobby and rooms are all very well furnished - beautiful decor.   Great night club in the basement - it is very isolated so you would not know it was there and frequented mostly by hotel guests.   Located next to Trinity College s‚Äôen across the street from Temple Bar (the tourist night spot zone) its very convenient to get around to see the sights of Dublin.  2 minute walk to trinity college, cross the street and you are in the ‚Äúnon sense‚Äù of Temple Bar, 5 min walk to Christ Church Cathedral - and all the public transit you need.

Starbucks just across the street and a great Chinese resto that stays open until 5 am .:.

202,A true sanctuary,"We enjoyed every minute of our stay at the property. The staff were all down to earth friendly people. 
In the Irish tradition of ‚ÄúKeep the home fires burning ‚Äú the Westin has not one but two fireplaces that are always burning in the reception area  sending out that vibe that you are welcome, safe, and home.
We had one of the Writers rooms on the 4 floor that was beautifully decorated with a huge bathroom by anyone‚Äôs standards.
Restaurant was fab, the mint bar down in the old bank vault was fab as was the room service.
Dublin is a young and vibrant city and The Westin sits smack in the middle of all the fun.
A fantastic place to base out of.",5,2019,10,19
202,"Service, room and food exceeded expectations","A hidden gem is afternoon tea at the Atrium Lounge on the mezzanine or in my case champagne and an appetizer. The architecture provided quiet corners for laptop work and open social areas to engage small groups. The skylight five stories up opened up the atrium. The menu, service and presentation foreshadowed the best lamb we've ever eaten at the Morelands Grill later that evening. ",5,2019,10,17

We arrived at 10am and the room was already ready. Our first impression was that it was a well designed luxury hotel with a team who did everything they could to make our stay exceptional.
We stayed in one of the new rooms on the mezzanine floor and it was modern and trendy.
The atrium bar was really nice and drinks were reasonably priced.
Breakfast was delicious with a wide selection of food.
The hotels location is great with Trinity College, Temple Bar and the Liffey all within a 5 minute walk. The airport shuttle bus stop is right outside the hotel.

Beautiful accommodations, lovely staff, superior customer service and excellent food ~ this is the perfect place to land after weeks of international travel.

I loved that I could get gluten free bread or a scone for breakfast  

The hotel is close to everything -- just perfect!",5,2019,10,13
202,The stunning Westin in Dublin.,"Me and my partner have just got back from the stunning Westin Hotel in Dublin. 

We stayed there for two nights from a Friday until Sunday, We arrived around 10am on Friday morning and we received a warm welcome from the reception team. 

Our room was ready straight away and we received the most beautiful room in the new wing of the hotel, room 008, the room had that wow feeling from the stunning bathroom with the walk in shower to one of the most comfortable beds i have ever slept in, there was also a lovely lounger and chair. 

The location of the hotel is perfect being directly opposite temple bar and the river being less than a 1 minute walk and trinity college and rest of the city on your doorstep. Also the Air coach drops you off and picks you up almost right next to the hotel. 

Breakfasts are served in Morelands Grill near to the reception and there was so much to choose from, there is a buffet and you can also choose things like pancakes, and waffles which were freshly made. 

We loved the Atrium and the bar area up the stunning staircase in the middle of the hotel. 

Next time we are in Dublin we will stay in this gorgeous hotel again. Thank you to everyone in the Hotel who made our stay such a great one.",5,2019,10,13
202,Dublin's Westin Hotel,We loved staying at the Westin in Dublin.  The hotel itself is beautiful and elegant with comfortable and spacious suites.   The staff are friendly and helpful.  The location was perfect for us to tour and enjoy Dublin!,5,2019,10,10
202,Exceptional Hotel,"The Westin Dublin is a great hotel and the location is fantastic! Located in the city center. Just a 15 minute ride from the airport! The hotel is walking distance to many sites! Christ Church, Trinity College, and shopping venues!
The staff are friendly and welcoming! The mint bar located on the lower level is a nice place for a nightcap.and the food at Morelands superb .
This property has so much to offer!
My room was newly renovated, beautiful ‚Äò",5,2019,10,09
202,Absolutely Fabulous,"I travel a lot and this was honestly probably the best hotel stay I have ever had.  First of all the service is amazing, they put rose petals on our bed for our anniversary - I mean who does that?  The staff is super friendly, very helpful, and it is always done with a smile.  There are great bars restaurants on property and the hotel is in a fantastic location.

We had our room upgraded to a larger room with roof top access where we had fantastic views of the city.  The hotel is in a great location with easy access to anywhere you want to go in Dublin.  I just can't explain how welcoming and wonderful our stay was.  There is no doubt when we go back to Dublin we are staying here.  Just a fantastic stay.",5,2019,10,08
202,Nice Overnight Stay,"Comfortable overnight stay before returning to the States.  Great location.  We walked to Trinity College, Grafton Street, Museums, and Pubs..  Had a great steak dinner at the restaurant.  Beautiful hotel and great staff.  ",5,2019,10,08
202,Excellent service central location,On the centrally located Westmoreland street across the Trinity college stays this jewel hotel. It is like a rectangular block along central lobby. As expected we ask for the inner facing rooms that are less noisy. The service at all facilities was superb. Few minor defects: 1) The big windows toward the central lobby cannot be open; 2) The carpets on the endless corridors and stairs toward the reception are to the least peculiar or not appropriate.,5,2019,10,07
202,Best hotel in Dublin,I just checked out of the westin Dublin. I work for marriott and we get the employee discount. It was by far one of the best hotels I have stayed in.From the moment you enter the hotel you can feel the difference.i would definitely come back again.,5,2019,10,07
202,Great location to start a Tour of Ireland,"This Westin is a great location to start any tour of Dublin or Ireland. It is located adjacent to two popular areas, Trinity College and Temple Bar.

The amenities at the Hotel are typical for an American/International chain which makes for an easy transition upon your arrival in Ireland.

The staff is extremely helpful with maps, directions and tips for getting around the city.

Entrance is on a busy street but the rooms are quiet and spacious enough to unwind",5,2019,10,04
202,Amazing Wedding & Events Manager,Last night my partner and I went to the Westin to view the venue for our wedding next year. From the moment we walked in we were overwhelmed. Not only is the hotel and banking hall absolutely stunning we were blown away by the competence and customer service provided to us by their meetings and events executive Tanya Farrell. Within 20 minutes she had us sold on the venue and moreover on her!! We have viewed plenty of 5 star hotels around Dublin and service like this we did not find!! Couldn‚Äôt recommend highly enough and we can‚Äôt wait to start planning our wedding with Tanya by our side ‚ò∫Ô∏è‚ò∫Ô∏è‚ò∫Ô∏è,5,2019,10,04
202,Loved it,"We booked a writer deluxe king room here, which turned out to be a large room on the top floor overlooking Trinity College. It had a large bathroom with both a shower and tub, and shelf space above the sink. There was a desk and chair, but no other chairs; a mini bar; and plenty of drawer space. The hotel is made up of several older buildings stitched together, so the rooms are definitely not your usual cookie cutter, perfectly square rooms.  Unexpectedly our room came with a small walk out balcony with seating, which we very much enjoyed, especially at night. I realized after visiting the Old Library that from our room we were looking at the roof of the Long Room at Trinity College, which was kind of cool. 

The hotel is very well located: just steps from the Westmoreland stop or Trinity stop on the green lua line, about 0.3 miles from the Abbey Street stop on the red lua line, and about 0.1 miles from the Airlink 747 express bus stop at College Green & Temple Bar. It‚Äôs also an easy walk down Fleet Street to reach the Temple Bar area. I found the staff here lovely and helpful, and I would definitely stay here again.",5,2019,10,03
202,Excellent Location in Downtown Dublin,"I stayed several nights at the Westin Dublin and found this centrally located hotel to be perfect for touring Dublin on foot.  Just across the street was the beginning of the Temple Bar restaurant and shop area.  Trinity University was one block to the south.  The Liffey River was several blocks north.  You can get just everywhere from the Westin on foot.  Food service downstairs was generally good, although the buffet eggs at breakfast were ugly--order from the menu and you'll be fine.  The room was spacious and comfortable.",4,2019,09,28
202,"I highly recedomend The Westin Dublin, You will be very pleased!","Love! Love! Love ! The rooms were beautiful, location was amazing walking distance to all , staff was friendly, helpful, made you feel welcome and amazing! I highly recommend The Westin Dublin! I cant hardly wait to return for a vacation with my friends and family!",5,2019,09,27
202,"The very definition of ""First Class Act"".","We so enjoyed our stay at the Westin Dublin.  The staff were so kind and attentive to every detail. 
They never ceased to amaze us!  The property was in a great location - we were able to walk everywhere. The hotel and all of its areas (from the lobby to the tea room to the restaurants and bar area) were spotless and so lovely.... a must if staying in Dublin - for sure!",5,2019,09,26
202,Cynthia Keller,"Wonderful hotel, friendly staff that go out of their way to please.  Wonderful location within walking distance to major attractions. Food in  Morelands is quite good.  Breakfast buffet very good with options for special orders off the menue. ",5,2019,09,26
202,Dublin's Best!,"Don't even think twice. This place is on another level with service. Perfect location and staff. I am already want to go back. Dublin also is an amazing cant miss if you are considering Ireland. Also, a great base for day trips to the coast.",5,2019,09,26
202,Was looking forward to an exceptional stay but was very disappointed,"when people ask me where to stay for that special break in dublin I always recommend the Westin, how I remember it as staff being exceptional, food superb, and heavenly beds,

Well the beds are still amazing but sadly the service is no more, we arrived checked in went to the room, sink was broken and only one bathrobe in the room, we mentioned it when we were heading out for dinner and the receptionist made a big condescending comment about we have tonnes of robes if you really want another, I said yes please... On our return the sink was fixed no sign of an extra robe but extra towels were left, disappointed.  We slept like babies and were looking forward to breakfast, on arrival we were asked if we had a reservation which we didn't, we were shown to a table and told about food we could order separately, I only understood fhe pancakes and my partner picked up on porridge, there was a third choice but I was expectingba menu on the table but there was none.  Breakfast buffet was beautifully set up. But there were no juice glasses, and no  bacon, eggs or hash browns, the clonakilty pudding could be bounced off the floors and sausages were cool. As for the coffee it was disappointing.

I did contact the hotel directly but only got a standard reply as I felt it needed to be addressed",3,2019,09,23
202,Hidden gem,"Go for a coffee or a drink to this hidden oasis in the centre of the city . 
Just marvellous if you need to get away from the hustle and bustle. Wonderful service .
We just had coffee but got the same attention as the other guests having afternoon tea .",5,2019,09,17
202,Marriott Suite Night Awards Worthless,"The only good thing about this hotel is it‚Äôs prime location at the center of Dublin. Walking distance to everything. 

I booked a 5-night stay using Marriott points, which i worked hard to accumulate. I did this 2 months in advance, and used my 5 suite night awards as a platinum member to request for a suite upgrade. They denied it 2 days before my arrival. SNAs I guess are worthless here, so what‚Äôs the point of choosing Them once u reach Marriott platinum? I checked every single day to see if suites free up, but they never did. They said they did upgrade me to a ‚Äúclub room,‚Äù which is a misnomer because the hotel does not have a club lounge, but only better ‚Äúin room‚Äù amenities the hotel staff said. The room was so cramped I didn‚Äôt even have a place to fully lay out my full size luggage. There were no special amenities in the room, and if that room is cramped I could only imagine the regular rooms. Housekeeping was mostly substandard; they just do the bed and the bathroom, and does not tidy the rest of the room, and they don‚Äôt make up the bed well either. 

Simply a disappointment for me. 

",1,2019,09,16
202,Disappointed,"Booked this hotel with my Marriot Points and from the moment I arrived it was not a good experience. Staff at front desk very rude and not welcoming. I was given a room that was tiny and faced the back yard area (men wording outside). In addition to men working outside the room above me had men working during the day..it sounded like a jackhammer. I booked this hotel to break up my journey to Middle East...big mistake.
On a positive note the location is excellent. The bar is very cute, nice atmosphere and the restaurant where I had dinner was amazing. Considering the problems encountered the Manager did return 1/2 of my points and paid for the taxi to the airport. They did send a bottle of wine to my room as well.  ",3,2019,09,16
202,Always Pleased but even more so today,"I love Marriott and always choose its brand when traveling, when available.  After a two week tour of Ireland, it is such a pleasure to spend our final night in the comfort and quality of the Westin Hotel Dublin. I literally squealed in delight in laying on the customary plush bed with the fluffy pillows, but am exceptionally pleased to find a top sheet!!  None of the hotels and B&Bs in our travels had this. Nor did they have the cool air jetting into our room... and most didn't have face clothes let alone mouth wash and bottled water. 

Great, responsive staff.  Beautiful view of the Dublin streets.  Great location close to stores, restaurants and bars.  Within half hour of airport. 

Yay Marriott/Bonvoy!",5,2019,09,13
202,Our Go To Stopover Hotel in Dublin,"My wife and I have stayed at the Westin on numerous occasions, when in Ireland.  It is our go to stop over on our first night into Ireland and our last night before flying out.

The hotel is very centrally located in the city.  Close to Trinity College, the shopping district and plenty of dining and nightlife options.

All of the lightrail construction has been completed outfront.  It is a little tricky now to understand where to pull up to the hotel for valet, given the lightrail tracks are right at the hotel front door.  You actually have to go just beyond the hotel and turn on the side street to be able pull over for valet and unloading of your car.

The staff here is always great.  Very friendly, efficient and knowledgeable.  The rooms are very nice, modern and provide good space.

I highly recommend the Westin for quick overnight stay before/after your flight or if you entire visit is just to Dublin.  You really can not get more centrally located than the Westin.",5,2019,09,13
202,Poor Night Management and Rude Staff,"I am a lifetime Titanium member and I was traveling on an early flight back to the United States.  I went to meet 2 friends, so we can consolidate luggage for our liquids we purchased before going to the airport.  It was 3 am and the night security guard would not let me back into the hotel, even with my hotel key.  He questioned about my guest and I said they weren't registered at the hotel because I was the only one staying there and I brought them back so we can re-pack and head to the airport in an hour.  He said that was not allowed and would not let me into the hotel.  I said I would gladly cancel my reservation and leave the hotel, but would still not let me in with my companions.  I asked to speak to a manager and he said he was the manager.  I said that was false as I would think Marriott would not let this guy handle customers. A night manager finally came and said I would have to pay to let my companions in even though I was going to be leaving in a few hours.  I said that was ridiculous and I would rather cancel my reservation.  He would not let me cancel, but would charge me if my companions went up to the room.  I had to get my belongings and leave for the airport without even staying in the room.  Lost my points and didn't even stay in the room.",1,2019,09,12
202,Great location!,"Delightful and lovely -- and grand hotel in a perfect Dublin location. We had the best time! The staff could not have been more helpful. We especially appreciated the elegant, low key interior decoration. Our room felt like home!",5,2019,09,09
202,Terrific Dublin Hotel,We loved staying at the Westin Dublin.  It's located right in the center of everything we wanted to see and do in Dublin.  It's a beautiful old building that's been very nicely restored into a fine hotel.  The service is excellent and the rooms are beautiful and comfortable.  I would recommend the Westin Dublin to anyone traveling to Dublin.,5,2019,09,08
202,Great Location and Hotel,We stayed at the Westin Dublin for 2 nights.  I could not have been better.  Great location and the staff was very accommodating when it came to getting a taxi/ride somewhere.  Very good experience.  I highly recommend this hotel.,5,2019,09,04
202,"You know what your getting at Westin, and they always make it right!","I am the first to admit when I am wrong, and I am doing that now. I was quick to write a hasty review earlier today - so here is the updated review, along with the original review for transparency. The lack of sleep, overall weariness, and being in pain from too much travel definitely got the better of me. And as the kind manager said in his response - I too wish I had waited until I had at least gotten into my room to finish the full review, as I think the positives of the room would have outweighed any negatives I experienced earlier! While I still don't like that the mobile app allows for what seems like an early check in, giving false hope when you're at you're most vulnerable and at your wits end... the room I was put in, is spectacular. It is a two room suite, with a proper ""living"" area, bedroom and beautiful bathroom. 

Let's start with the living area. You walk into to a nice little bar area with a Nespresso machine, beautiful crystal glass ware, a selection of teas and coffees, and a mini bar hidden within the cabinetry. Then you walk up the stairs to a luxe full couch and chair set (much different from that found in the Atrium Lounge), big flat screen TV and coffee table. The windows are high, and the curtains go floor to ceiling, which makes the room feel nice and big.  There's also a very nice desk which has all types of outlets - which I especially appreciate given I brought the wrong kind of adapters with me! It has one US outlet, a USB, the two prong outlet as well as 2 of the IE outlets.  There's also a ""suite pad"" which I'm not entirely sure how to use, but looks cool. The only down side  to this room: it's a bit dark when the sun goes down, and it took me a while to figure out how to turn on the lights. (Note: there's a space right by the door to insert your key so that you can actually make the switches work! Then hunting for the switches, you're on your own). 

Bedroom: There's there heavenly bed that you know and love in all its king sized glory (this is the only thing I wanted allllll day!), another high window with floor to ceiling curtains, another large flat screen TV, two night stands and plenty of outlets (if you brought the right adapters - these outlets are the three-prong IE outlets! (Still hitting myself on the head over that one!). And there's a very nice, modern and up to date iHome alarm clock and docking station. My phone sits perfectly here, and the white noise plays directly through the speakers making for the perfect ambiance for a good nights sleep. There's also a great closet, with an awesome hair dryer (it even has the attachment for if you want to blow dry your hair straight), lots of hangers two robes and an outlet in the closet. Clearly my favorite room in the suite!

Bathroom: This room is just about as big as the bedroom! There are two pedestal sinks, a HUGE and luxurious bathtub (that I will be testing out) and a nice modern shower with the heavenly rainfall shower head. They also thought of a lot of little details in this room. They provided shower/bath poofs (those spongy things), bath salts, dental kits with toothbrushes and toothpaste, really nice shampoo, conditioner, shower gel and body lotion, and even some beauty supplies like finger nail files, q-tips and cotton rounds. The downsides of this room: There's not a lot of counter space - I ended up using one of the sinks for most of my stuff. And the shower is REALLY slippery. I actually fell getting in, and think I'll have a nice bruise tomorrow (but that rainfall shower head felt so good, I almost didn't care that I was showering on the ground!). I didn't notice until after, that there looks like there's some sort of rubber bath mat of sorts that I could probably use in the shower for the future. 

I also ordered room service tonight, and the salmon was impeccable. Nice crispy skin - light and flavorful sauce - and they remember my special request of no rice. 

And overall - the staff have really been so extremely friendly and welcoming. So many people came up to me during my wait at the Atrium Bar to make sure I was ok. They didn't charge me for the drink I didn't like, and were very fast with everything! And the manager that responded to my first review was so gracious and understanding, I really felt I owed it to him to redo this review, and do it justice, and hope this also servers as an apology for my hasty review earlier today!  

ORIGINAL REVIEW FOR TRANSPARENCY (but take it with a grain of salt due to my crankiness): 
After 15 hours of grueling air travel with absolutely no sleep, I was counting on the trusty Westin to take care of me. I‚Äôm a loyal Bonvoy member, gold status,  and every time I‚Äôm in Dublin this is where I‚Äôve chosen to stay. Mind you, there are much cheaper, equally as nice locations (that after reading this I‚Äôm sure you will check out!) - but in my head I‚Äôve always thought I could count on Westin‚Äôs. You know what you‚Äôre getting. So, once again I chose the Westin Dublin. I knew I‚Äôd be coming in early, so I did mobile check in 2 days early (so PLENTY of notice of my early arrival request), I confirmed multiple times. And today, I arrived only to be told my room was not ready. There are still people in it - and there‚Äôs ‚Äúnothing they can do.‚Äù I‚Äôm exhausted, barely can keep my eyes open, haven‚Äôt showered, weary - still have that gold status - and ‚Äúthere‚Äôs nothing they can do.‚Äù I even asked for a lesser room just so I can lay down. I don‚Äôt really believe that there is ‚Äúnothing‚Äù they can do. They just don‚Äôt want to. For whatever reason, I‚Äôm not worthy of them doing something. The overpriced rate they are charging doesn‚Äôt equate ‚Äúdoing something.‚Äù I understand that 3:00 is the check in time, but why offer early check in then via the mobile app? And as a perk to status members? Don‚Äôt tease.... 

Instead - they sent me up to the overpriced atrium lounge to get ‚Äúlots of drinks.‚Äù Clearly i don‚Äôt want drinks, i just want to sleep. But though these seats look cozy, they are anything but. They are kind of like your grandma‚Äôs old velour chairs that look pretty, but are hard, and the seats are too small for your behind, and the back is so rigid it forces you into perfect posture.

 The wait staff is extremely friendly though. And they don‚Äôt know how to make an aperol spritz! Instead they talked me into some other version of one that is so cloyingly sweet, now my teeth ache on top of everything else. I also ordered the club sandwich, and was pleasantly surprised that it was delicious. The bacon inside was crisp - fresh lettuce and tomato, perfectly toasted bread, moist grilled chicken, and just the right amount of mayo. The egg was a bit too overly fried, but all in all a really tasty sandwich. The saving grace for waiting out this room. 

Speaking of... This room better be something, to make up for the tortuous waiting. (UPDATE: it was... see above)",4,2019,09,04
202,Brilliant location,"Loved the location of this hotel. Could walk to a number of landmarks. Concierge very helpful.  Valet parking expensive but really no other option. Room comfortable with good amenities, what you expect from this brand.",5,2019,09,02
202,Superb,"Always love the ambience in the beautiful Westin bar, was very well looked after by a very courteous, friendly and excellent cocktail maker Jeremy who looked after our service for thr night, also had some delicious sauvignon blanc,elegant atmosphere as always and, love the attention to detail with the extras given in this hotel for that extra being looked after feeling for guests and patrons, cannot wait to return for another relaxing evening.",5,2019,09,01
202,Great Spot!,"We arrived in Dublin at the end of our trip around the beautiful island and we saved the best hotel for last!  From start to finish our stay was wonderful!  The hotel is situated in a perfect spot for site seeing either by bus, tram or walking.",5,2019,08,31
202,One to the Best Hotels!!,"We absolutely loved our stay at the Westin Dublin! Every member of the hotel's staff made us feel sincerely welcomed. Hotel is gorgeous, super clean and fabulous location! Food was great as well. When we plan another holiday in Ireland, we would definitely return to this hotel. ",5,2019,08,30
202,family vacation,"The Hotel is situated in the heart of Dublin very close to trinity College and numerous other site downtown. The Hotel staff were extremely friendly and helpful from the doorman, to registration, room service, etc. Our room was clean, comfortable and  well serviced. My wife and I were traveling with our 17 year old daughter for the first time in Ireland and the Westin Dublin was the perfect place to stay, we will definitely be back.",5,2019,08,29
202,We‚Äôll be back!,"The Westin is well-situated a block away from Trinity College with easy access to shops, dining, and public transportation.  The staff were all so gracious and accommodating, even good humored about delivering coffee to our room at 4:30 am.  The decor is tasteful; the rooms are clean, spacious, and well-designed.  We enjoyed all three in-house dining options at the Grill, Mint Bar, and Atrium.  I highly recommend this hotel for short or long-term stays.",5,2019,08,27
202,Great Start to an Ireland Vacation,The Westin Dublin is a luxurious hotel located perfectly in Dublin to get to all of the sights.  The rooms are spacious and well appointed.  The staff is friendly and knowledgeable.  We felt we got tremendous value to get an A+ property and experience at a reasonable cost.,5,2019,08,26
202,Great location for a fine hotel,"Stayed here for two of our last days in Dublin.  It is located such that we walked to everything we wanted to see in that time (we like to walk).  It is right on the eastern edge of the Temple District and it is a perfect location.

The hotel itself is excellent with friendly staff, a very good restaurant, and a nice bar in the basement for your nightcaps.",5,2019,08,25
202,Location and Ambiance,"I chose this hotel, in spite of its cost, because of its proximity to Trinity College and it was perfect for that. The room assigned to me when I checked in faced a wall, although, when booking it, I had paid extra for a ""city view"" room. The desk clerk didn't seem very happy in changing it, but I did get a room with a street view. I should add that, at least on the 2nd floor, the hallways were very circuitous, necessitating directional signs for the elevator. The staff, in general, was solicitous and I did not have the feeling that they expected a tip. Even more than my room, I enjoyed the marble lobby with it Roman-style columns and its two working fireplaces. ",5,2019,08,25
202,"Luxury, location and character - the perfect combination ","I had the pleasure of staying 4 nights at The Westin Dublin. 

Beautiful and elegant. Location is perfect, a stones throw away from Trinty College, Bank of Ireland, Temple Bar.

The hotel itself has history and character, my room was upgraded due to elite status. Bed was very comfortable but the room itself was on the small side and a little dark.  Service and staff was good and very helpful when needed. Breakfast was nice, pretty standard offering but what was there was tasty. Enjoyed the bar in the vault.

Definitely would recommend staying here and look forward to my next visit.",5,2019,08,25
202,Great place to stay,Central location and convenient to everything in Dublin. Amazing staff! Visit the folks down in The Mint Bar. It used to be the bank vault and the mixologists know how to build a drink! We'll be back to visit!,5,2019,08,24
202,Lovely!,"My husband and I had a wonderful 2-night stay here to begin our Ireland trip. Though our room was small, it was very nice and extremely comfortable. The service was professional and friendly, location was perfect and the breakfast buffet was delicious with much to choose from. We would definitely stay here again!",5,2019,08,16
202,Nice Luxury hotel with high attitude,"My family lived in this luxury hotel, but attitude is very high at reception or restaurant too, and rooms are compact being old hotel, with excellent location in city centre, with most attractions close by",3,2019,08,16
202,If you want two adjoining rooms beware...,We booked two rooms and requested that they be anjoining several months ago as we are traveling with our young children. We emailed the day before to make sure the request was met. When we arrived we were told that there are no adjoining rooms and no suites available. We would have booked another hotel has we known adjoining rooms were not an option. And we were also told that no manager could speak to us. So if you are traveling with kids and need more space don‚Äôt stay here.,1,2019,08,15
202,Comfort in Dublin,"Husband and I stayed here for 5 nights before joining an escorted tour of Ireland.  Everything was great, including a large comfortable room, bathroom with both shower and tub, Nespresso machine for excellent coffee before breakfast.  It's in a super location on Westmoreland Street, next to Trinity College and across the street from the start of Temple Bar.  Every staff member was friendly and extremely accommodating.  After our tour was over we returned to Dublin and planned to stay another 4 nights at another hotel where the tour had ended.  However, that hotel (Trinity City) was not nearly as comfortable, so we moved back to the Westin.  True, the the Westin was more expensive, but SO much more comfortable in every way.  
It's worth nothing that some rooms are a bit dreary because they do not front on Westmoreland or overlook Trinity College. We appreciated the staff going above and beyond to move us to a room with more light, after we checked into a room which, while large, was dark.  
The hotel has excellent air conditioning (and it was rather warm when we were there) but windows do open a bit if you prefer fresh air.",5,2019,08,14
202,Really good,"Really nice place and very well located.

The room was very clean and cozy. Very good amenities and amazing breakfast! Will come here again! I highly recommend it !! Its decoration is not modern but classic.",5,2019,08,13
202,Good and Bad,"The Westin Dublin was our first choice of hotel as my husband and I are both Titanium for life Marriott Bonvoy memebers.  We love the Westin Heavenly bed and service.  We used 50,000 points per night for our stay, significant but we though worth it for our first trip to Ireland where we planned to stay 35 days.  Dubin was our first stop.  The hotel is in a great location.  We asked on checkin if we were able to have an upgrade based on our status and were told we were upgraded from 2 twin beds to a king bed room.  That's were the good stops.  We were given a room with a ""tiny"" almost non existent window facing over a type of alley, not even sure what it was but it was terrible to look at.  Overall, staff were okay, the best feature was the bar in the lower level of the hotel which was cozy during inclement weather.  We feel like we wasted a tone of points on our stay and realize our titanium status which we worked long and hard to achieve had no status at this hotel.

Looking at pictures of the rooms on tripadvisor makes me think I am looking at a different hotel than where we stayed.  Our room looked nothing like any these pictures.

Very disappointing - just word to the wise.  If you are titanium and using points don't expect anything at this hotel for your precious point stay.",1,2019,08,08
202,Luxury in the heart of Dublin,"The location cannot be beat. The staff are all very welcoming. The water bottles that are available in the morning are appreciated after a long walk/run in the park! It was about a 25 Euro Taxi ride to the airport. Close to everything in central Dublin. Rooms are well appointed and very clean. The main restaurant, off the lobby, is a little odd (for lack of a better word). Staff do not seem to know anything about the food they serve, food is not very good and the manager is a bit disconnected from reality. Otherwise, a lovely stay and would definitely return!",5,2019,08,07
202,Fantastic .ocation,"We stayed here for 3 nights and loved the hotel.  It is next to Temple Bar restaurants and bars, Grafton St., Trinity College, and less than a 10 min walk to Dublin Castle and St. Patrick's cathedral.  Rooms and beds are comfy, staff is prompt and courteous and the buffet breakfast is terrific.  The Mint Bar in the basement is a super cool speakeasy bar.  The o ly issue we had was the wifi doesn't work in the rooms.",5,2019,08,04
202,Great Location,"Spent two nights at the Westin.  It is in a great location and close to lots of places to see, pubs and restaurants.  Our room was a bit odd with no real full window.  There was a skylight and a small window up high.  No view at all.  The room condition was very good with only a few minor signs of wear.  The staff were very good, helpful and upbeat.  The included breakfast was very good as was the service.",4,2019,08,02
202,The restaurant is incredible!,We very much enjoyed our stay at the Westin in Dublin the highlight of our stay was the restaurant! The salmon was incredible and so was the mushroom risotto. I highly recommend staying here it is also very well located in the central location right next to Trinity College & the book of Kells.,5,2019,07,22
202,Fantastic Hotel ,"The Westin Dublin is perfectly located for all your Dublin adventures. The service at this hotel is superb. Staff here goes out of their way to exceed your expectations. We highly recommend this fantastic hotel.

202,4days visit ,"Very nice hotel. Center of city. Good service and breakfast is spread well too very comfortable stay staff are very friendly.going to north tomorrow visit Belfast let see if we like it. Nothing more to write 
",5,2019,07,21
202,"Excellent hotel, great location",Our family booked two rooms for one night in Dublin - we wish we could have stayed longer! The hotel was a short walk to everything. The staff were super friendly. The rooms were beautiful and really clean! The beds and robes were comfy - we can't say enough good things. Will definitely be returning to The Westin Dublin!,5,2019,07,16
202,Way to kick off a tour of Ireland ,Our tour of Ireland started of just right. We arrived early to the Hotel but that didn‚Äôt phase the staff at all. They said a room would be ready in 30 minutes and they would text us when it was and tight on cue we got our text. Room was very nice and comfortable. Room was clean and bed was perfect. Staff was very nice and accommodating. ,5,2019,07,15
202,A wonderful Dublin experience .,My family and I had three room for a few nights to end out our Ireland vacation . Our experience at the Westin was top notch from the minute we checked in until the minute we checked out . If you are planning a visit to Dublin and want a first class stay this is the place . ,5,2019,07,14
202,Nice long-term stay,"I stayed here for about 10 days while my little sister was participating in a study abroad program at Trinity college next door. The location was ideal and within 5-15 minutes walking distance to most of the museums, churches, Dublin castle, etc and close great restaurants in temple bar. The room was everything you would expect from a Westin. The bed and pillows are always inviting and caused me to sleep in many days. The gym is nice, but small and it gets hot when it‚Äôs crowded. I joined the nearby Trinity college fitness center for $40 for a week. The staff was friendly and remembered me after a few days of pulling around my car for my daily jaunts around Ireland. The doorman even said a nice goodbye to me when I finally checked out. ",4,2019,07,12
202,Make sure you get room you paid for,"We booked a Deluxe Kingsize room, we were given room 442, the window looked out onto a roof, no view at all so we asked to be moved to a room with a city view as described on the website, we were then given room 138 a lovely bright room but not what we paid for, a queen bed, no bath only a walk in shower (I chose Deluxe King as It had a bath as well as a shower) no fridge or mini bar! Very disappointed as we booked in March! Decided not to ask to be moved again and unpacked as we are only here for two nights.",3,2019,07,12
202,LOVED IT,"I could not recommend this hotel more highly. It was perfectly situated in the center of town, the on site restaurant was very good and the staff was excellent. If you are going to be staying in Dublin, I can't think of a better place for you to stay.",5,2019,07,10
202,"Great central location, good place to stay","Spent a couple of days staying here and the best thing about this hotel really is the location. It is really close to most things (public transport, the spire, the river Liffey, Trinity college, bars & shops and nightlife).

The hotel is housed in a grand and unmistakeable iconic building that I‚Äôm guessing used to be a bank. Part of the appeal is the historic feel of the building which can be felt through the name of certain parts of the hotel- the banking hall, which was magnificent. I managed to peek in when it was being prepared for a function. Beautiful architecture. Unfortunately this part usually remains off limits to guests. 

The room I stayed in was very spacious and looked out onto some office windows. Although the bed was very comfortable and all the amenities were great, the room itself lacked light (natural or otherwise) and even with 2 windows was very dark and depressing in the Irish summer. Even with the bedside lamp and the lamps in the corner of the room, there was a real need for a central light on the ceiling. The bed lights on the headboard on either side of each bed also didn‚Äôt work which was a shame as this might have helped with the overall depressing feel. 

On the other hand, the bathroom was impeccably finished with the most beautiful grey marble and was almost perfect if not for the fact that closing both sides of the doors left a gap in the middle- not ideal if sharing the bedroom! 

The hotel had an interesting atrium in the center of it which was visible from the main  lifts. It seemed like quite a popular spot for afternoon tea or a quick bite among guests or an ideal meeting place. 

Breakfast buffet was served at the restaurant downstairs and the spread was acceptable. A nice touch was the honeycomb served still in its frame. The locally made yogurts and muesli were also delicious. They had a fruit smoothy which was great too. However for ‚Ç¨20/pax for the buffet, to charge extra just for omelettes did seem a bit penny pinching for a hotel of this caliber. 

Overall the staff were ok with some members who were outstanding and others who were quite cold even when approached directly. If the service was more heartfelt and not forced I would have given it a higher rating. 

Stay for the location. ",3,2019,07,08
202,Good location in Dublin City Center,"We stayed here for 5 days. The Hotel was under a bit of renovation work, but this did not interfere with our stay, room accommodation or hotel ambiance.  It is a nice hotel with a super cool atrium bar and high tea service.
 Our room was spacious and clean, with a large bathroom,  (& very nice showerüòÄ). Beds were comfortable roo.
Breakfast was available, which we ate at every morning.  It was a decent spread... really liked the muesli, locally made yogurt, and jams. I would have liked a better selection of fresh fruit,
, and more cheese and meat options... I guess I was spoiled in Italy and FranceüòÇ
The staff are very helpful and room service was fast too. I would like to see a more kid friendly menu options too.  
Overall, all was satisfactory",4,2019,07,07
202,Great location ,"We picked the Westin because all reviews said it was a great location and indeed it was. Almost every thing is within walking distance. There are tons of public transportation. Plenty of bars, restaurants and shopping all within close proximity. Our room was nice and clean and quiet. The shower pressure was good. The AC worked okay enough to keep the room cool but not cold. 
I did encounter a small issue during check in. One of the nights was booked by using points through Cap One who uses Expedia. The system showed we owed money for that night but luckily for me I had brought a copy of my reservation as proof and the issue was resolved quickly. Had I not had the proof we most likely would have to pay. I hate to use third party reservations as I have heard there are many problems with them. 
Breakfast had slim choices but you were allowed to order eggs but not omelettes as part of the buffet fee. ",5,2019,07,06
202,One of Dublin‚Äôs best kept secrets ,"The Westin Dublin is an institution of warm hospitality and great service. Their iconic building is a distinguished statement in Westmoreland Street, in Dublin city centre. It is recognizable by its fa√ßade & clock tower overlooking the famous Spire on one side and the pristine College Street entrance to the Banking Hall, overlooking Trinity College on the other side.

Location, location, location. Can‚Äôt get more accessible than this. The staff are very friendly and the service is impeccable. 

Must have dinner at Morelands Grill. Their steaks melt in your mouth like butter and honey. You can thank me later. Book a table in advance, the place can get busy on weekends. 

After drinks, I recommend you go have drinks at Mint Bar, also within the hotel. Look for Vladimir‚Äîthe Gin whisperer! He can whip up the best G&T you will ever have. Absolutely, a must experience. 

The suites are lovely, beds are cozy, you‚Äôll have a hard time leaving the bedroom. Overall, an amazing experience and I will be coming back. 

Hands down, 5 stars. 

Only the best,
Mr. Raven ",5,2019,07,04
202,Treated like royalty!,"We spent two nights at the Westin Dublin, and could not have asked for a better location!  We walked quite a bit...just down the block from Trinity College, Book of Kells.  We caught a bus for a tour to Ring of Kerry just a 10 minute walk away, and grabbed the ""hop on, hop off"" right down the block!  You are across from Temple Bar area.  The staff was wonderful and answered any question that we might have a arranged all cabs and tours that we desired.  I will return again!",5,2019,07,02
202,Stay in Dublin,Brenda at the reception desk was outstanding.  She made us feel welcome and was very knowledge and helped fine the places on the map we wanted to visit.  She was also able to get us checked in early which was very helpful as we had arrived that morning from the USA.  We would infinity book the Hotel again as it was in easy walking distance to the things we wanted to visit.,5,2019,07,01
202,A Great Stay in Dublin,"The Westin Dublin is ideally located within easy walking distance to many Dublin sights, museums, and pub/dining establishments.  The hotel amenities are what you would expect at any top-tier hotel in the U.S., coupled with a staff that is very accommodating and friendly.  This was our first trip to Dublin and we were only sorry that we did not allocate more days of our trip to this bustling, interesting city.  

The hotel itself is quiet, well furnished and comfortable.  There is a very good restaurant on property, as well as an atrium bar that will serve you a memorable afternoon tea, rivaling (and, we thought, surpassing) the afternoon tea at Harrod's in London.  You really need to experience this delicious repast at least once!

The concierge desk is extremely helpful.  In addition to their taking care of your luggage, you can count on them to be helpful selecting a local restaurant, recommending a pub, or arranging a taxi for you.

We will definitely stay here on our next trip to Dublin.",5,2019,06,30
202,Great location,The Westin is conveniently located within walking distance of many Dublin sights and lots of Dublin shopping. Staff is efficient and courteous. Hotel being renovated so it isn‚Äôt pretty from the outside but service is top notch ,4,2019,06,28
202,Top shelf experience,"The Westin Dublin could not be more perfectly located.  It is an elegant hotel with outstanding service and amenities.  The breakfast buffet is ample, but you can also cooked to order options.  The bar in the lower level is quiet, but fun and the bartenders have great skill with classic and modern cocktails.",5,2019,06,27
202,Avoid during refurbishment - it can get noisy!,"The Westin and the adjacent bank are going through refurbishment (which is good!), but it can get quite noisy during the day. Arriving very early, we wanted to take a nap in the afternoon which was impossible because of the drilling on our floor.",3,2019,06,23
202,Glad I didn't actually pay for my stay!,"Normally reviews are quite easy to write but this one is hard because on one hand we did enjoy our 3 night stay here but equally we didn‚Äôt.  Most of all though, I am glad that we didn‚Äôt pay the over-priced rate quoted and instead cashed in some of my Marriott points.

I‚Äôll start with the positives ‚Äì the front desk staff were very welcoming and helpful with any query you had and likewise every time you passed reception they always said hello to you.   The concierge guys were very helpful too, especially Allan, and they sorted out the valet parking/bags very efficiently.  The evening restaurant staff were very nice and could perhaps teach their breakfast colleagues on how to actually engage with customers!  

Despite being a Marriott Titanium member, we didn‚Äôt receive any upgrade although the atrium facing room itself was comfortable and unlike some of the comments I have read it was spacious enough.  The bathroom looked very dated and the tiled floor was extremely slippy when walking on it in your stocking soles and if there was any water on the floor.  There wasn‚Äôt any grab-rails on the wall, and given the slippery floor, I was very nervous of stepping onto the floor after having a shower but thankfully came to no harm.

We did have an issue on our last night where the toilet cistern sprang a leak and there was water all over the floor.  A call to the front desk had it temporarily sorted out, so we at least had a dry floor overnight‚Ä¶ what we weren‚Äôt expecting them to do was come in and start repairing the cistern while we were having breakfast so that we couldn‚Äôt use the bathroom at all before checking out!

TBH for most of the stay, you‚Äôd never actually know you were in Dublin.  The concierge guys and some of the evening waiting staff had Irish accents but that was about it.  Even at breakfast time, it seemed to be very much standard Marriott food ‚Äì no soda bread for example that I grew to love at the AC in Belfast!  I wasn‚Äôt amused at either at being presented for a bill when ordering an omelette one day despite us having breakfast as my Titanium welcome gift ‚Äì never before have I been charged for one at any other Marriott I have stayed in!

I will hopefully return to Dublin one day but I very much doubt it will be to stay at The Westin.",3,2019,06,12
202,They don't build them like this any more!,"If you want to see the beauty of the buildings of yesteryear then this is one hotel you have to visit  Sit in the Atrium cafe and admire the stunning symmetry of the windows looking down on the former courtyard or if you upgrade, admire the view into trinity college and enjoy the peace and quiet that comes with being so high above the street. The hotel is beautifully maintained which shows off how much thought went into the original building. One of very few old hotels which are accessible.",4,2019,06,12
202,Lovely Hotel in a Great Location,"After a six-hour overnight flight with no sleep, we arrived at the Westin Dublin at around 7 am to some good news: our room was ready! After a five-hour nap, we were feeling much better and ready to explore Dublin. This is a beautiful old hotel with a Victorian feel. The bathroom was lovely, beautiful lighting and a large sunken tub, if you like baths. The room was small and the bed was a queen, but everything was very comfortable. The breakfast was very good: wonderful breads, eggs to order, meats and cheeses, and the hotel is very well located: our room overlooked the stone buildings of Trinity College (see photo from room). We were there two nights and had dinner at two good restaurants a short walk from the hotel.  See reviews for the Green Hen (French Bistro) and Doheny & Nesbitt (traditional pub).  We used Marriott reward points to book our room.
",5,2019,06,11
202,Great stay and location!,"We had a wonderful stay at the Westin while in Dublin. It is in a great location, right across the street from temple bar area and really walkable to most attractions in the city. Everyone was very helpful and it was outstanding service! I used a suite night reward to upgrade and we were upgraded to the Westmoreland suite which was beautiful. A huge room compared to all other European rooms we stayed in that week. I would definitely recommend the Westin to anyone traveling whether vacation or business!",5,2019,06,11
202,Staff was off the charts helpful!,We had A LOT of trouble with a reservation at another property. We decided to walk on it and eat the cost. Westin bent over backwards to give us a room that met our needs on no advance notice. Won‚Äôt stay anywhere else in Dublin. Ever. ,5,2019,06,11
202,Great Location,"The Westin is well located.  You can walk from the hotel to any of Dublin's attractions.   Built from 3 old buildings, the hotel has kept the original facade, but the inside floorplan is slightly confusing with some two story rooms, but that adds to the charm.  There is work going on at the hotel and one side of the hotel has a screen in front of it.   I happend to have a two story room behind the screen, which meant that my window was covered.  I could not tell if it was rainy or sunny outside, and did not like sleeping in a windowless room.  I wish I had known about the window issue when I booked the room.  However, the room was comfortable and  I have no other complaints about the hotel.  The serivce was good, and the restaurant is fine. ",5,2019,06,10
202,Great location,"I had the opportunity to stay at the Westin Dublin on 2 occasions in April.  This hotel is at a great location as it is centrally located.  In Dublin most of the attractions are within walking distance.
Breakfast during the week starts at 630am on weekend and holidays it starts at 7am.  There are hot items eggs, bacon and sausage.  There are also the normal items such as bread, fruit, cereal, yogurt, cheese and cold cuts.
The staff are very helpful.  
This hotel used to be a bank.  The hotel offers traditional tea in the afternoons on the 2nd floor.  A room tip if you can avoid a room facing the street.  I did have a room I did not find it to noisy but some people might.  
The beds are very comfortable.  They do offer the green choice program.
I did find the internet a bit slow at times.  
I did not receive a welcome gift.  I am a titanium member with the Marriott program.",4,2019,06,05
202,"Not 5 star but 3 star , outdated, fake luxury, no service, no atmosphere","Rooms ,not clean, bathroom in spite of renovation not functioning toilet bad flush, shower impractical, floor not clean.
Bad lighting in room, which for its price had very basic furnture and was with inside view of hotel lobby from window.
Restaurant breakfast substandard.
Meetingrooms not adequate lighting. 
A pity as with location andoriginal building more could have been done.",2,2019,06,05
202,Classic Luxury,"The Westin Dublin beats the competition by far as a classy classic luxurious hotel. With very comfortable rooms and excellent dining, this is a distinctive Westin managed like a clockwork by its well trained staff in a landmark building at the city center.",4,2019,06,04
202,This is not a nice or 5 star hotel - HORRIBLE!!!!,"We have never had such a bad experience at a hotel.  First thing, they ignored the request of Bonvoy for us to use suite nights earned after staying many nights in a Marriott hotel.  We are Titanium Elite members and no recognition of such was acknowledged at this hotel.

There have been so many problems, I will organize for easier reading:

Dining:  Breakfast is normally included for levels within the Elite status.  Yes, breakfast was included.  This was OK with scrambled eggs not being cooked to appropriate temparture and liquid in the bottom of the pan, old irish bacon not being rotated, extremly slow or non existent service at the table and this was 5 mornings in  row.  No refill on coffee and when asking for a Latte the cup was not full and I asked it it could be filled and I was told ""that is just how the machine works"".  May I please have the machine do it again so I can have a full cup?  

There was even an extra charge if an omelet or other items were ordered.  Never have I seen this one before.

Room:  Thankful we asked for a king bed as our room, even though said to be an upgrade was very small.  Smallest King we have ever slept in.  The room was poorly made up.  Sheets were not changed, nor pillow cases.  Last day, we complained so the pillow cases were changed the next day.  We were without bath mat, coffee and cream, the light was out in the closet, the ironing board was broken, and the iron leaked all over our dress clothes.  

In addition to sheets not being changed, the room was not vacuumed our entire stay.  The floor was filthy as our socks were soiled when walking around.

Internet:  Slow and not able to stream anything

Coffee to GO:  Both mine and my husbands lids did not fit the cups and we spilled coffee all over ourselves on our bus excursion.  I had on a new shirt that was ruined.   

We were told breakfast would start at 6:30 and it did not open on the weekends until 7 so we went without as our excursion started at 7.

How on earth does this hotel stay in business and have such a great review?  I believe it is people that do not know how a hotel should operate.

We did talk to a Manager and received some complimentary items; this included some chocolate, a Guiness, some cheese and 4 apples.  After this, our sheets were still not changed, just the pillow cases.  There were crumbs in the bed which was not from us as we do not eat in bed.  Also, the room was cleaned a bit better but the trash was not entirely emptied.

I whole heartedly recommend the other Marriott which is very close.  The Shelbourne, Autograph was amazing!

We also smelled smoke in our room from smoking on two nights.  Reported this and nothing was done.",1,2019,06,04
202,Perfect location ,"An ideal location for trinity college and the temple bar area. This hotel is right in the heart of the city and east walking distance to restaurants and attractions.  The basement bar , the mint bar, was very good and this hotel had a nice breakfast buffet.",4,2019,06,02
202,"Classic, chic centre of town","All you expect from a Westin. Stylish 5 start hotel, large lobby, efficient staff, nice, well sized room, with large bathroom and all amenities. Free wifi, and water in the room. Good bar too. Expensive breakfast, but with large choice, less then 30 minutes from the airport and walking distance of all city sightseeing. Free umbrella to borrow, important as it rains quiet often.......

",4,2019,05,30
202,This is not....,"the Westin we know! Check in was ok and we as a Platinum Member got a upgrade to the Club Room. The room was the smallest we ever had ! We asked for a bigger room even if we have to pay more, but the Hotel was fully booked. The Atrium Lounge looked nice for a drink, but took more than half a hour to make a order. The waitress was busy and no other person was helping. The hotel is working on a new facade and should put this on they website. We complained that and we were told there is no noise and disturbance. 
We had noise!  
Breakfast is very basic. Second morning was a shortage of bread. 
Staff are friendly and room was clean. 
We would not booked again in Westin Dublin. ",3,2019,05,24
202,Substandard Westin,"Have stayed in several Westins and this was the worst.

Location was good and the property is in a gorgeous old sandstone building but rooms, amenities and loyalty recognition was abysmal.

The fit out is incredibly old. The room was severely worn down and really in need of a refit. The room was also a couple of minutes walk and many turns from the elevator. The rest of the hotels interiors were also old and in poor condition. 

No executive lounge. Gym was a joke, the size of a guest room with very little equipment despite there being quite a few guests turning up wanting to use it. Breakfast was more what you'd expect in a mid-market Mercure, Novotel or Crowne Plaza.

Service from staff was quite good and that were very friendly but there was little or no recognition of status on check in. I'm a Platinum Member but don't believe my room was upgraded. No welcome drink. No complimentary breakfast. 

Pretty poor form for a hotel charging EUR350+

No recognition as a Platinum member. ",2,2019,05,21
202,great service,"We stayed here for 2 nights at the beginning of an Ireland trip.  The hotel was very welcoming and efficient as we arrived.  Our room was ready for us before the check-in time which was much appreciated after an overnight flight from the US.  The room itself was lovely - clean and spacious; and the management sent up a welcome gift of sparking water and chocolates.  The location was good, near Temple Bar, Trinity College and Grafton Street.  Our package included breakfast which was very good.  Overall a great place to kickoff a Irish trip.",5,2019,05,21
202,Our first choice for next trip,"Great location for walking. Close to Temple Bar, O'Connell Street, and Grafton Street. Trinity College with the Old Library and the Book of Kells is on the next block. Breakfast is reasonable if you order ala carte; the breakfast buffet is expensive unless you have a big appetite.",5,2019,05,20
202,"Wonderful Location, Comfy Hotel, Great Service","My husband and I stayed here for a trip we took to celebrate his birthday. We reached out to the staff beforehand, and they treated us with an upgraded room that had a wonderful balcony view of Trinity College. The room was spacious, clean and the bathroom amenities were top notch. A big thank you to Dorian for the wonderful treatment. 
Platinum (Titanium) members have the option of free breakfast and it was worth it. The buffet is large with lots of options and the additional choice of a hot meal to order is also included. 
The staff was wonderful and customer service impressed us very much. The check-in and out was very easy and the staff was very helpful with providing information on the location/things to do in the area. 

The location is steps from Trinity College and a short (5 min walk) to both Grafton Street and Temple Bar areas. You can't beat that! 

Definitely would recommend this place.",5,2019,05,20
202,Worn down and arrogant service,"The Westin is benefiting from the Dublin Brexit-boom offering a worn down product at excessive rates. 

The rooms are dark, musty and have mold in plain site. When I first stayed in December I thought it was maybe just the room I was in and I was there for one quick night and did not fuss. Then this past month a multi-night stay had me in a different and equally as filthy room. Tears in the carpet, cigarette burns in drapes, etc. 

Location is good for tourist attractions, that must be stated. That said hard to get to by taxi and to get a taxi. Taxis need to pull around the back for pick up and drop off. There should be an alternate hotel entrance there, and guests not be made to walk under the scaffolding and into the front door a good 150 meters away. 

Restaurant average and overpriced. Breakfast light on offerings and quality (cold cereal in cheap plastic silos found in hostels and budget hotels, really???). Lounge in basement is good, but a dark basement. 

Gym deplorable

Bellmen/doorman staff spotty

Check-in staff capable and smiley, a plus. 

Never once saw the concierge at his/her post. 

Management (lurking in the back room) intrusive and rude...seemingly new to hotel management in response to hotel getting too busy too fast on back of Brexit. 

Many better full service hotels in town at similar price point. I don‚Äôt plan on experiencing a strike three at this property.",1,2019,05,18
202,Comfortable well located hotel with hopeless wifi,"Set across a former stock market and banking chamber on Westmoreland street this beautiful hotel lies between the relative elegance of Grafton st and St Stephen's green's georgian mansions and the less salubrious pubs and fleshpots of Temple bar and the grim reality of O'Connell street. The rooms I have used over 4 stays have all been quiet, comfortable and well appointed with the classic Westin beds, cosmetics, Nespresso machine, water for Bonvoy members and a pretty good breakfast buffet. Central dublin has a distinct shortage of quality hotel rooms and so the hotel is heavily booked by mostly american touring groups finding their Irish heritage from late may on. As a result room prices go through the roof and easily challenge New York, London or Tokyo prices, meaning they feel like terrible value to the independent traveller. The biggest downside is the wifi. This is a hotel that has forgotten its business travels needing fast broadband. On multiple visits and different parts of the hotel the wifi has been consistently poor,, on occasion meaning using my phone to 'hotspot' was necessary to get documents. I was given an alternative 'hidden network' log-in that was little better. Furthermore, the gym is woeful with one of 2 exercise bikes out of order over several weeks despite being flagged to the front desk.  The management really need to sort some aspects of the hotel to bring it up to international standards and to look after frequent business travellers.",4,2019,05,13
202,Central location ,"Central location, nice and clean, love the bed and bathroom, very convenient, good staff and service, I have attached some photos here. We stayed 2 nights. Afternoon tea was great. WiFi is slow though",5,2019,05,12
202,Lovely hotel but rather noisy and overpriced,"My husband and I stayed for one night and had originally booked an atrium facing room.  Upon arrival we were upgraded to a larger room which, whilst very comfortable, was closer to the main road.

The room was very comfortable and the staff with whom we had contact were professional and attentive.

However, had we not been paying for the room with Marriott points, we would not have booked it as it is very expensive to stay here and frankly, a little overpriced.

The room was noisy at night as it was a public holiday Monday and there was considerable noise coming from the nearby bars.  Not the hotel‚Äôs fault of course but their soundproofing for rooms facing that direction could arguably be improved.  We didn‚Äôt complain as we always travel with earplugs so managed to sleep just fine.

Parking was extortionate at the hotel so we parked in the Temple Bar area at the Fleet Street car park which was less than 20 Euros so about a third of the cost and a five minute walk away.

We didn‚Äôt have breakfast at the hotel as it would have cost an additional 50 Euros between us which was nonsense.

So it‚Äôs lovely, very central and with good staff, but not cheap and a bit loud.",4,2019,05,10
202,Nice Place to stay,"Unfortunately we had only a short stay at the Westin Dublin Hotel. It is definitely a place that is worth to return to. The Hotel is very elegant and has extremely friendly and helpful staff. The location is perfect and there was nothing to complain about.
One of the highlights of our visit was the Afternoon Tea which was served in a nice atmosphere by very attentive and cordial staff. The Gin Mojito served in a tea pot was an experience I had never before.",5,2019,05,10
202,Exceptional,I can't say enough about how much we loved this hotel.  It was in a perfect location with easy access to The Temple Bar area with lots of restaurants and shops in close proximity.  The bed was very comfortable and although our room faced a major street there was very little noise heard in our rooms.   We will definitely be staying here again.,5,2019,05,08
202,All good,"As expected in a high class hotel, all is good. Location in the city centre is the best. The room looked good and the staff was very friendly. The internet connection in the room worked very well too.",5,2019,05,07
202,Afternoon tea,"Lovely afternoon tea at The Westin for my birthday. Relaxed and quiet atmosphere, nice staff and a great selection of tasty savoury and sweet treats, plus good coffee and a selection of teas. Highly recommend a visit.

Convenient location in city centre, with luas stop close by.",5,2019,05,07
202,Remarkably welcoming staff,"We really enjoyed staying at the Westin Dublin, conveniently situated near Trinity College. The food quality (breakfast and lunch) in the Moreland's Grill was very good. We were a little disappointed in the bar menu offered in the downstairs Mint bar. The staff of the hotel were charming and very helpful throughout our stay.",5,2019,05,07
202,Truly Amazing. The best experience ever,I had an amazing night at The Westin Dublin recently. We stayed in the beautiful Samuel Beckett Suite. Truly remarkable and possibly the best hotel room that I have ever stayed in. The staff and were amazing and particularly Lorna for looking after us so well. And breakfast delivered to the room. What more can I say. I loved everything about the experience.,5,2019,05,06
202,Lovely Easter stay,Stayed for 2 nights in this lovely hotel. It‚Äôs a bit disappointing outside at the moment as it seems to be undergoing a makeover. Rooms are beautiful and the bed is so comfy. Really enjoyed the stay and the bank cocktail bar is great. We weren‚Äôt able to get a table on the Saturday night however we did on the Sunday. Staff were really friendly. Would definitely return.,5,2019,05,05
202,Wonderful Westin,"My first trip to Dublin and I could not have picked a better property than the Westin Dublin. I was greeted at my taxi, warmly welcomed by the reception desk and checked in quickly. They acknowledged my Marriott status ( only silver- not a VIP) and I was in my room in no time. The property is very centrally located to many of the top attractions and is a great place to start out if just walking about. The food and service in Morelands was delicious and afternoon tea in The Atrium is a treat. The concierge is especially helpful- a zipper broke on a piece of my luggage and they immediately recommended a luggage repair shop within walking distance. Highly recommend the Westin Dublin. ",5,2019,05,05
202,Great location,"Location, location, location, easy walk to anywhere in the city centre. Gym is ok, so is the room  a the breakfast. Nothing extraordinary, a good hotel in a great location. There is a ongoing renovation which didn‚Äôt cause any disturbance.",4,2019,04,30
202,A Great Stay in Dublin,"I stayed at this hotel for 5 days/4 nights and really enjoyed it! It is in a great location - you are in the city center and only a 2-3 minute walk away from the hustle and bustle. Temple Bar is also across the street, so you do not hear the noise from the hotel which is nice. 

Upon entering the hotel, you already feel relaxed. The ambiance is calm and classy, and the people who work there are very nice and helpful. The rooms are spacious, clean, and provide you with everything you need. The breakfast was great as well. There is a huge variety of food and drinks to pick from. I especially loved the fruit and bread options. There is also traditional Irish breakfast to try. 

I will definitely stay here again next time I come to Dublin!",5,2019,04,30
202,The Westin Dublin - Leisure Stay,"We had such a wonderful stay.  Everything from check-in to the beautiful room was seamless.  The staff were so warm and welcoming.  The location is fabulous, just opposite the historic Trinity College and 5 minutes from Grafton Street.  It was so quiet despite being in the City Centre.  I highly recommend The Westin.  Thank for such a fabulous stay.  ",5,2019,04,25
202,Disappointing ,"Booked a night away to celebrate a special occasion, room I paid for had a balcony and other extras, on checking in had been told I had been upgraded only to find that the room we had been given was a downgrade from the actual room we had booked. 

Ordered breakfast in bed only to find that several items were missing. 

On returning home found that the hotel had charged us for breakfast twice although this was included in the original room rate

Emailed on the 2nd April and again on the 16th April and have of yet to receive and explanation other that two standard automated type responses, although on checking money has been refunded

As a five star hotel extremely disappointed with the level of customer service. 

Staff were pleasant enough and hotel is in good location however for what they are charging you are not receiving a five star experience 

Sorry to say I wont be back and cant recommend to family or friends ",2,2019,04,24
202,Excellent stay - Large rooms!,"We stayed in Dublin at The Westin hotel on April 20 and simply loved everything.  From the location, the lobby, the cleanliness and service all-around, we were thrilled with our choice.  The rooms are very clean, very modern and large -- always a welcome treat when traveling abroad to places like Ireland, Scotland, etc.  There were plenty of restaurants, pubs and places to shop in very short walking distance -- and we appreciated our time in the Mint Bar with our bartender, Vlad (Vladimir) from Cypress who kept us so entertained, cared for -- and never let our drinks run dry!  He was truly a very hard worker and very in-tune with his guests.  He sincerely made our stay extra enjoyable!  That being said, everyone on staff at the bar was wonderful -- and we thank you all for treating us so well.  :)",5,2019,04,22
202,Good hotel near city center !,"I stayed at The Westin for about a week on a business trip. Compared to other Westin‚Äôs I have stayed at, the hotel was quite average. 

While the rooms are nice and plush, the hotel lacks a good fitness center. Also, for the exorbitant price the breakfast options are quite limited.",4,2019,04,21
202,Afternoon tea,Our son bought us afternoon tea here and we want this afternoon. Greeted by a lovely hostess and seated in very plush seats. We had a choice of two teas one was mojito. Food excellent as we were half way through our food the hostess came with a jug with envelopes inside she said it was a draw for dinner for two in the moorlands grill in the basement . We won !!! . So we booked for dinner in the next couple of weeks something else to look foreword to well done and thank you.,5,2019,04,20
202,Travel with my daughter,"The Westin is in a fantastic location that is close to the Temple Bar area and 
Trinity College.  The concierge was extremely helpful in finding restaurants/pubs that were appropriate for me and my 16 year old daughter to grab a bite and see some music. The front desk was very efficient in checking us in and gave us options for getting to the 3Arena for a concert.  Very helpful.  Upon checkout, there were 3 drinks from the minibar not on my bill.  The lady at the front desk told me that she would not charge me since they missed it, and I was honest about it.  I have never had that happen before!   They made my gift to my daughter very special by just doing what they seem to go on a daily basis - take good care of their guests.  ",5,2019,04,16
202,Great hotel in a highly convenient Dublin location,"I've stayed at this hotel many times, first as part of a holiday and later as part of a number of recurring business trips.  This hotel fits the bill for both work and leisure as the historic charms (particularly noteworthy given that it's a Westin) provide nice character and amenities for holidays, while the standard Westin features make this a reliable standard for work trips.  
Hotel staff are fantastic across the board from the front desk associates to the room service attendants, managers, and folks at the front door.  They quickly began remembering me each week and have gone above and beyond to make my stays enjoyable as I've continued returning.",5,2019,04,15
202,Incredible hotel ,"amazing location combined with some of the best staff that I have met. Breakfast is not to be missed...local honeycomb was incredible along with the Irish soda bread.
You can literally walk to all must see areas and many such as GPO and Trinity are around the corner. The general Manager Eamonn Casey runs an incredible hotel. We also had dinner and again the food and service was amazing. The bar is a happening spot on the weekend and definitely worth a visit. Thanks for an incredible stay!
 ",5,2019,04,15
202,Decent Hotel,"This is our second visit to Dublin, previously we stayed at The Shelbourne Hotel.  We mention this because we want to be clear that a rating of 3 is not bad, but not equal to a 5 we would give The Shelbourne Hotel.  The Westin Dublin is a very nice, clean hotel and we didn't have any issues with our stay.  Why not a rating of 5?  We are in the top of the Marriott Bonvoy program and at most hotels like The Shelbourne Hotel, they really go out of their way to make you feel special to include a bottle of wine, a cheese board and a thank you card in your room and a complimentary breakfast each day.  At The Westin Dublin, we got a thank you at check in and the typical would you like points or a gift?  The remainder of our 5 day stay, the hotel staff didn't recall our names or if we were even paying guest.  So disappointing and this is the amazing service is the difference between a 3 and a 5.  The Shelbourne Hotel knew all of the names of their Elite guests and always made you feel welcome.  If you want a nice accommodation, The Westin Dublin will suit your needs.  If you want amazing service,  look elsewhere.",3,2019,04,14
202,Incredible,"Wonderful wonderful wonderful experience at this Westin. Stayed one night here on the back end of a Europe trip and found this place to be exceptional. Beautiful, well cared for property in the heart of Dublin. Staff goes out of their way to take care of guests. No request goes unanswered and you feel so well taken care of. We even needed to make a room change because I‚Äôm a light sleeper and there were some loud neighbors. The front desk made it happen quickly and even comped us some drinks for the hassle. Hard to find service like this these days. Will be back here for sure. If you‚Äôre going to Dublin do yourself a huge favor and book a room here. Many thanks to the front desk staff for their amazing hospitality and to the bell hops who took care of our bags before we even asked.",5,2019,04,13
202,Great place to stay in Dublin for business or pleasure ,"Excellent service, lovely & clean rooms, wide variety of tasty breakfast options including continental style and made to order, and the location is perfect. Convenient to Trinity, Grafton Street, Temple Bar, the river Liffy, and so much more! Highly recommend!",5,2019,04,13
202,Excellent classic hotel,"I found the Westin to not only be in a great location in the City Center, but also with excellent customer service and classic hotel design combined with modern conveniences.  The rooms may be classic wood, paneling and bathroom, but everything works with modern reliability and performance.  A perfect blend and free Wi-Fi also included.  I did not use the gym or fitness center, but the Westin is close to great running paths with excellent running maps provided by the concierge. There are tons of great restaurants within walking distance of < 10 minutes, so I could not complain.  

The one downside: the hotel is always 100% full, so there is almost ZERO chance of a room upgrade even if you are the highest Bonvoy status.",5,2019,04,12
202,Afternoon tea,"Where do I begin? I have stayed at Westin‚Äôs many times in the US and Canada and the Dublin location did not disappoint. Attended afternoon tea with two friends and it was by far was of the highlights of our trip, food wise. Upon entering we were greeted by Greg. A kind young man that we shared many many laughs with and received EXCELLENT service. We had an amazing time and enjoyed the wonderful food and tea.  

We would highly recommend the Westin for afternoon tea and ask for Greg!  He turkey made the whole experience that much better!

",5,2019,04,08
202,Best in Dublin,"The Westin Dublin continues to be the premier hotel located in the heart of Dublin. The staff is terrific and is second to none. Everyone is glad to be of service with information, and helpful suggestions.  The location is opposite Trinity College, and accessible to everything Dublin has to offer. The rooms are a wonderful blend of elegance and technology.  Without hesitation, I would recommend this hotel as the place to stay in Dublin for business or pleasure.",5,2019,04,08
202,Better service and Value available elsewhere,"I‚Äôm a long time Marriott customer with lifetime gold and titanium elite status with the Brand. I found this location to be sub par for the Westin line. Staff was less than helpful and slow in responding to all requests and management took over 72 hours to respond directly to concerns. This brand is supposed to be a premium hotel and this location does not live up to advertised service levels. The list of issues I encountered is too long to rehash. I‚Äôll just say there are better hotels of greater value to choose in the area. If you wish to travel brilliantly as one of the brand‚Äôs tag lines implores, avoid this location.",1,2019,04,08
202,You saved our weekend!,"A huge thank you to all of the team from both myself and my partner. We were sent here this past weekend by the hotel we originally booked due to an internal error,and we were treated like royalty! 

Special thanks to Sean the late manager on Friday April 5th, and the young lady who accompanied him on the front desk. As you can imagine, we were slightly panicked and you saved my partners birthday present! Everyone was friendly and tentative and made us a main priority.  

We will be back again soon, and this time we will be booking you on purpose! Thank you again. See you soon!",5,2019,04,08
202,Perfect Dublin location,"Stayed 2 nights, had 2 rooms (1 king, 1 with double and twin bed),  Both rooms were great and much larger than I expected.  Beds were amazingly comfortable!   Breakfast in restaurant was great as was the nightcap in the Mint Bar. 

Hotel is in perfect location - near Trinity College, Grafton Street, Temple Bar area, etc. This was my 2nd stay at the Westin, and will definitely stay here again.",5,2019,04,02
202,Guest Service.. beware they don‚Äôt follow thru,"Checked in on 3/21 at 715pm
Asked for two things. Wake up call and transportation arrangements 
They assured me no problem
But
No wake up call 
No transportation arranged.   
Beware they do not follow up even for elite members.   Bonvoy nada

202,Wonderful stay,"On my recent trip around Ireland I stayed in this beautiful hotel.
First thing I noticed was the amazing doorman. What a lovely friendly welcome I was given. He took my case inside and showed me direct to the reception.
The room was as you'd expect in a hotel this lovely and were spotless.
I met my friend here for a drink in the bar downstairs which has a lovely setting with the bar in the middle.
My friend and I then went out for dinner with the lovely friendly doorman recommending a lovely Chinese restaurant not far from the hotel.
Although I only stayed the one night I was very impressed with the whole hotel service and staff and will certainly stay here again on my return",4,2019,03,26
202,Greatest Location Ever,"Short walk to Temple Bar, Trinity College, St. Stephen‚Äôs Green, Grafton Street and some of Dublin‚Äôs best restaurants.  Some of my favorite restaurants were: Sole Seafood Grill, La Cucina, The Bank on College Green and the Whitefriar Grill Steakhouse. If shopping, don‚Äôt forget to check out Henry Street as well.",5,2019,03,25
202,Amazing front desk service,"My boyfriend and I traveled to Dublin March 7th and stayed at the Westin in Dublin the night of the 7th and 8th. We received outstanding service from all the staff working that weekend. One front desk employee in particular, Jane, stood out to us. She was extremely pleasant to talk to, answering all of our questions with a warm smile. We could tell she genuinely wanted to help us and was not just going through the motions. She deserves recognition from management as she is a great asset to your team. Thank you Jane !",5,2019,03,21
202,Westin Dublin - excellent location and service,"We stayed here 2 nights - large room, great service, breakfast buffet was good with fast service on omelettes, MINT bar has great cocktail menu too and had a DJ.  Couldn't beat the location - walking distance to Temple Bar area (across the street), Trinity College and more",5,2019,03,19
202,"Very short stay, perfect location!","A business trip to a new country - sounds fun but never is. More like touring the world's airports and hotels. However, this lovely hotel was steps away from Trinity College where we were able to tour the beautiful library and see the Book of Kells. It's also just down the block from a wonderful shopping plaza. The location was so wonderful, I was able to get a small taste of Dublin in just an hour. 
The rooms were spacious and clean and the hotel was very nice. Modern but with a feel of luxury. One of the nicer hotels on my tour of airports and hotels of the world.",5,2019,03,18
202,Great customer service,"A special thanks to Sam at reception.
Our pre booking on arrival showed our daughter to be booked an adult even though our online booing has her age at 13 yeas as a child.  Their system has an additional surcharge of appeox $2000 for our 10 night stay, but Sam was most helpful to resolve this and and ensure we were made happy by the Westin Dubai and not charge the addional fee.

Well done and a special thanks to Sam!

Would highly recommend anyone to enjoy the wonderfull politness and facilities at this great resort and location.",5,2019,03,17
202,Nice central hotel,"Stayed for 1 night with my husband in February.  A fabulous smell in the lobby which I suspect was from the spa but made the lobby smell divine. 
Room was nice, on the small side.  The room overlooked the inner part of the hotel where afternoon tea was being served.   Shower was huge as well as a bath tub.  Shame there was only 1 bath robe in the room for 2 people staying. 
Went down to the bar for a drink and it was quite busy. Service at the bar was quite slow.  There was a band in the bar and they were excellent.  
Breakfast was self service.  I did see people being brought food but there were no menus on the table.  I asked for gluten free bread and was eventually brought some.  Would have expected more from a 5 star hotel for breakfast.",4,2019,03,17
202,Great stay!,"I used Marriott points for this 4 night stay.  I got my platinum upgrade and an early check in as requested.  Room was clean, nicely furnished, bed a little soft.  We had a view of Trinity but honestly you're not going to be inside much so I don't think an inside view would be so bad.  In other reviews I read complaints about non Irish staff not understanding English.  I had no such problems.  Front desk people were warm, welcoming and helpful.  The concierge, Marcin, was always helpful and always had a warm smile.  The hotel is very centrally located making many destinations within walking distance.  One light rail line is right outside and the other is a few blocks away.  Great to use.  Breakfast was a buffet which was fine, not extravagant, but who needs that anyway.  Overall, we were very pleased and I'm glad I didn't focus on the occasional negative reviews.",5,2019,03,16
202,Best I‚Äôve been to in a while,As the title says this is the best hotel for business I have been to in a while. A quick stop over but will certainly be back and use as a base when I return. Excellent service all round with very clean and crisp rooms. I had room service lunch and dinner and the food was excellent (especially the pick me mix salad option) well proportioned and away from the usual stodgy fair. Didn‚Äôt have tome to see the exercise facilities which will do on a longer trip. ,5,2019,03,13
202,One night,"We had a 20 hour layover in Dublin and stayed at the Westin. It was great. Right inline with other Westins I have stayed in. The heavenly bed was was great as usual as was the whole room. The location was perfect, in the Temple Bar area so easy walking to shops and pubs. We ate at the restaurant/bar downstairs because by the time we were ready to eat all the pubs were crowded. It was Sat night after-all. The soup was mediocre, but maybe thats the way it is and I just expected more. The Irish Soda Bread was excellent. All the staff was very friendly and helpful. I would stay there again. ",5,2019,03,12
202,Great location,"Decided on Westin versus the Renaissance, chose this. Was happy with the decision. Hotel is not over the top but I really enjoyed my room. It was well laid out and the bathroom was large, spacious, and new. Location is really perfect. Exactly where you want to be. Location makes this 5* when it's really a 4* hotel.",5,2019,03,11
202,Best hotel in central Dublin!,"One of my favorite Westin properties anywhere.  Lovely staff everywhere (front desk, conceirge, engineering, housekeeping).  Great old building, beautifully done up as a hotel.  Thick walls, quiet triple-glazed windows, very comfortable.  Have had afternoon tea at all the ""great"" Dublin hotels and the Atrium tea here was the best, hands down.  Great location too; couldn't ask for better.
",5,2019,03,11
202,Great location but few issues,"I recently stayed for 2 nights at the hotel

Pros:
- the staff at the hotel is extremely courteous and wonderful. Right from the reception to the concierge, they all make you fee at home and welcome, which is great.
- the rooms are well sized for European standards. The beds are comfortable and the rooms are fitted with all necessary amenities that one requires.
- the bathrooms are equally spacious with a separate shower and tub area.
- the biggest thing going for this hotel is its location. It sits right next door to Trinity and directly opposite the Temple Bar. Every landmark in Dublin is a walk away. You really cant beat the location of this hotel. 

Cons:
- the hotel is creaking in the corners and is in need of a certain upgrade and maintenance. For instance, my tv refused to come on in the room and was fixed the next day. The coffee machine too seemed as if it had not been operated for a while and needed a good 10 mins each day to work.
- i found the lighting in the room a bit dim and outdated. 

Given its unbeatable location and staff, if the above issues are taken care of, this could be the best place to stay in Dublin.",3,2019,03,01
202,Fantastic Hotel right in the heart of the city,Hotel right in the heart of the city. Very short walk to the Temple Bar area and Trinity College. Very close to The Irish Whiskey Museum which is worth a visit just to find out about Irtish culture. Rooms are very good and beds very comfortable. Staff are excellent and very friendly. The Mint Bar is the perfect way to end a long hard day walking round the city. Would add a few more Irish Whiskey's to the collection but still a decent selection.  Was the perfect stay for Valentine's get away.     ,5,2019,02,26
202,"elegant charm, great location","our room was upgraded to a gorgeous suite that had the most incredible furnishings and a very comfortable bed. luxurious fabrics  and details such as built in millwork and heated towel rack, made for a very comfortable stay. very friendly staff, and the breakfast buffet was delicious. located across from trinity college, it is very close to great shopping and restaurants. ",5,2019,02,25
202,Best In room Massage,"While there, my Husband scheduled a In Room Massage for me, one of the very best massages I have ever had. Staff is very Attentative and very welcoming. Easy to walk anywhere to see and shop and eat, or eat within the hotel itself.",4,2019,02,22
202,Filobedor1,"I found no fault with this hotel , we had a wonderful wk-end & we shall return in the summer.  Location was excellent, right in the heart of the city no need for taxis if you where having a city break. ",5,2019,02,19
202,Don't hesitate to stay here when in Dublin,"I don't just look forward to staying at the Westin Dublin; I'm eager to. Why? There is nothing this hotel doesn't do well and with a timeless excellence. The rooms are luxurious, with deeply relaxing beds, tubs, showers, and views from decks. I have stayed here seven times, and I have never had a bad room. In the heart of Dublin, the rooms are as quiet as libraries. The tearoom is a beautiful place to relax by the fire and think or read or socialize. The breakfasts are out of this world: beautiful Irish fare and a splendid assortment of baked goods, hearty dishes, local yogurts, and full-bodied tea and coffee. The service is a throwback to another time -- there is no attitude or attempt to find the lowest common denominator. This is a place that wants to say ""yes,"" and therein lies all the difference. It's close to everything but also offers the removal of a sanctuary. I have stayed at other hotels in Dublin, but once I experienced The Westin Dublin, I don't stay anywhere else. One of the finest hotels in all my travels around the globe. ",5,2019,02,19
202,Unbelievable Hotel,"Me and my girlfriend went for a one night stay in mid February. Right from the off the hotel staff were friendly and welcoming. Amy on the front desk, was so helpful.  The room was amazing, clean, warm and the views were fantastic overlooking Trinity College and the mountains to the South of Dublin.  The hotel is so central and is not even a five minute walk to Grafton street for shopping, which the girlfriend was more than happy to take advantage of or Temple Bar for a pint or food. Food in the hotel was really tasty and presented beatifully. Would definitely recommend the Morelands Grill. Shea, Rosa and all the other staff really paid attention to us and the rest of the people eating and the food was to delicious would recommend the waffles or pancakes for breakfast.
The hotel held our bags even after we checked out which I thought was a nice touch as we didn‚Äôt have to carry them about the city centre. Overall 10/10 service and will definitely be back.",5,2019,02,18
202,Fabulous stay,"Had the best overnight stay on Valentine's, great location, easy check in, super huge room with fab bed and bedding. Drinks in The Mint Bar saw attentive service and the added bonus of live music, wonderful way to end our evening. Breakfast next morning was plentiful and just the ticket to set us up for the day. Could not fault a thing on our stay and will be returning on our next visit to Dublin, and hopefully for longer next time. ",5,2019,02,18
202,Fabulous Stay,"After looking into  many Dublin hotels, I chose the Westin because it accommodated 3 of us in one room, and was also centrally located. Well, we were very pleased with our choice. The Westin was at one time a bank, and had been converted into a hotel. So the floor and room layout was different from a standard hotel, and it was quite interesting. We had a super large room and it was soooo comfy, as was the rollaway bed. And the bathroom was gorgeous, very large and modern with marble and new fixtures and showers. We were also ideally located across the street from the beginning of the Temple Bar area, so we did not have the noise yet we had access to all of the restaurants, pubs and fun. And the breakfast is excellent as well, better than running around trying to find somewhere to eat before an early morning tour.
The best thing about the Westin was the staff-they were all so nice and friendly and helpful. And then there is Dublin Allen--the doorman, concierge and travel agent all rolled into one. We loved him!! He sent us to all of the right places and was so interesting--he can be trusted to recommend the best! 
We would definitely return to the Westin again!!",5,2019,02,18
202,The Olace to Stay,It is a great Hotel.  Yo can have an excelent bedroon and the hotel offer to all all facilities you may need.  You have a good wi-fi and the front desk can help you to organize your visiting.  The restaurant is very good.,5,2019,02,15
202,Great property and location,Can't get a better location than this hotel. This is on the upper scale of Westin properties that I have stayed at during my travels. Tough to find availability here so book far in advance! Gym is small but nice.,5,2019,02,12
202,Global business traveller,"Beautiful period architecture and elegant modern amenities, provides an oasis of retreat, right in the center of this fair city!
The best ""dark and stormy"" I've had since my first, best time and I've been comparing..
Loved the casual, live jazz music in the corner of the bar. Loved the local produce at breakfast, great coffee too!
The Oscar Wilde Suite, was a real retreat, my favorite part... the upstairs mezzanine office area. I wished for longer than a one night business trip. Great place to be creative and think.
Elegance while comfortable throughout, kind and welcoming staff too.",5,2019,02,11
202,Gorgeous place to stay!,"Central for everything.  Rooms are very well acoustically  insulated. I slept like a log for 3 nights.  Breakfast was great.  Something for everyone, be it vegan, omnivore or carnivore.  Nothing is too much trouble for the staff in the restaurant.",5,2019,02,11
202,The most beautiful hotel in Dublin,The hotel is very central and simply beautiful. There's an extreme attention to detail. The staff is very professional and friendly. I had a perfect stay. I also recommend the lounge for a sunday lunch or a tea.,5,2019,02,06
202,England Ireland Rugby Stay,This hotel is brilliantly situated in the heart of Dublin shops food entertainment all only a 5 minute walk away.  Rooms were comfortable the Mint bar and event entertainment were excellent. Good variety of food at breakfast. Would thoroughly recommend mainly because of its location.,5,2019,02,04
202,No Heating In February,"Do not stay here if you‚Äôre looking for luxury. Nothing about it is 5 star, they‚Äôre scraping 4 at best. We had no heating for the 2 days we stayed, had to beg for a 2nd electric heater even after telling them my mother had pneumonia recently. No real reaction from staff regarding lack of heating either, terrible customer service. 
‚Ç¨25 breakfast was probably the lowest point of our stay too, Do not come here and waste your money.",2,2019,02,03

202,Great Location Nice Hotel,"We are in Dublin for a long weekend meeting some friends who we were meeting locally. We chose the hotel partly for location and also what we read about the quality. 

We were not let down. From arrival the staff were lovely and very helpful. I received an upgrade via my Marriott membership without asking which is always nice. 

The rooms are very comfortable, well fitted and modern. Bathrooms are spacious and all fully kitted as expected. 

The concierge was helpful throughout and we enjoyed the basement bar that had a gin special on and great music. 

From the hotel you walk to the shopping area of Grafton Street, restaurants of St Stephan‚Äôs Green and the bars and fun in Temple Bar. ",4,2019,01,25
202,Excellent service fro the Hotel Manager JOSIP,"I stay at the Westin Hotel on 12 January 2019. I had a warm welcomeby the Manager on duty JOSIP. He was very professional. Excellent service.  He is a good assets for the hotel. Among all those years I have been staying at  Westin Hotel , This was the best service ever I have received.  My Husband David Drought and myself felt valued guest upon arrival. He has a good smile, nice tone and excellent active listening.
He deserves a good recognition from the hotel.",5,2019,01,22
202,Great Property,"This now owned Marriott hotel, is located in a wonderful part of the city. The service is impeccable and the food was outstanding. We stayed in one of the suites-George Bernard Shaw. It had 2 levels with a winding staircase. The first floor is the bedroom and bath and the second floor is a living room and office area with a second flat screen TV. Pretty cool layout!",5,2019,01,21
202,Great hotel,"Had a one night stay in this hotel with my wife, the only downside we can say is that is that we didn‚Äôt have a window with a view. The internet was fast.
The staff were really friendly and provided everything we needed.
The other thing is that this hotel does not have a spa and we love spa.",4,2019,01,15
202,Afternoon tea,"The best Afternoon tea in a Dublin hotel has to be at The Westin. Decor beautiful, food wonderful and service excellent. Great selection of teas, coffees and drinks and everything was eaten by all. Delicious!",5,2019,01,15
202,Not your typical Westin experience,"The Good: centrally located, you can walk to many fantastic parts of the city from here, Trinity College is across the street, very nice doormen, concierge and staff. The room we had on the third floor, facing inward courtyard, was well appointed with nice amenities and clean. The Bad: 1) as I have read (now after the fact) the interior facing rooms are warm and stuffy. You cannot open the window for fresh air as there is none. We put the AC down to 60 F and it barely was blowing out cool air. I wonder if the interpretation of 60 F AC is different in Dublin....We needed to be cool in order to sleep, which we did not. To their credit (as it was late our first night after being out all day), housekeeping brought up 2 Dyson fans. They assured us engineering would fix the AC the next day and we were told the same thing the next morning but alas, still warm and no sleep so we kept the fans for three nights. They were helpful to a degree. 

2) The safe did not work so I advised front staff to not have housekeeping come as we took the Do Not Disturb sign off for the engineer. They cleaned anyway. We normally don't have housekeeping come on short stays anyway to be nicer to the environment. 3) The handle on the cabinet for the mini bar was broken. 4) The electric outlets above the desk did not work.

5) We had the concierge book us a car at Hertz so we could leave the city and explore all day Sunday. We were advised we would have to go to the Hertz office, about a 15 minute cab ride, and when we got there, they said they were at the hotel with our car. This is how we would have hoped it would be but clearly a miscommunication. The rental car rep said ""guests from the Westin should never have to come here to get a car. We always bring it to you."" (Side bar: we asked for a taxi who took a credit card and as we arrived he asked for cash. We told him we specifically asked for a taxi who took cc, then he whipped out his machine and we were able to pay. SIGH. Such a game. This is why ride shares are so popular). All of this was shared as they occurred (except for the taxi driver and the broken handle because of the experience of this trip, who cares about a %^&$ broken handle) with staff at the hotel. We reiterated everything upon checkout and was assured management would be advised and get back to me. Nothing yet and we've been back almost 2 days. I'll update with any good news from management.",3,2019,01,15
202,Wonderful!,"One night ""treat"" stay in January - booked with the intention of spending an afternoon in the city, and a night in Temple Bar.

Booking easy (via the Marriott app) - platinum status rewarded generously with an upgrade from a standard room to a ""View Deluxe King"" on the 4th.

Location perfect for our needs, easy trip to/from airport on the 757 bus. Check-in accomplished rapidly - reception staff professional and unobtrusive (a theme continued with everyone else we interacted with)

Couldn't fault the room, quiet, warm, amazing bed and opulent bathroom with a good supply of cosmetics.

Started the night with a drink in the Mint Bar, which was very nice!

A fantastic nights sleep was had, topped off with an amazing breakfast in the morning.

Our one bit of feedback for the hotel: In Room TV Channels are limited, and for a leisure break we'd have liked to have seen a bit less news and a bit more entertainment - perhaps a music channel? (Or provision of a Chromecast?)

Top property. Left feeling very well looked after. Will find an excuse to stay again.",5,2019,01,14
202,Nice afternoon tea,"Very nicely presently food, in elegant surroundings. The savouries were excellent, but very few compared to the sweet selection.Service was good especially the concierge, who was most helpful. Though disaapointing  that in an afternoon tea, no tea was included and you had to pay extra.",4,2019,01,13
202,Undoubtedly One of the Best,"I cannot recommend this hotel highly enough. From the valet parking to check out was incomparable to stays at other hotels. We were treated so well during our stay at The Westin.

Sincere thanks to the entire Front of House team especially Shea and Concierge Darragh along with others who made our visit thoroughly enjoyable and relaxed.

The bedroom was so spacious with a bed that is without doubt the most comfortable ever. Likewise with the bathroom including high pressure forest shower or the option of a bath.  Breakfast was served up until 11am which was greatly welcomed when on a getaway break.

The ambience of the hotel is calm and welcoming. I still need to find out what fragrance they spray in the lobby. I want it for my home!

We'll certainly be making a return visit to Dublin, if only to stay in The Westin.",5,2019,01,12
202,Good central hotel ,"We had just one night stay Saturday as part of a family group. Our double room on 4th floor was quite comfortable with shower and bath. The lobby was spacious with seating for other family members to meet and chat. We went out for meal but were disappointed on our late return that no residents bar was available to us. Breakfast was good, juices fruit, porridge cooked to order. Cooked breakfast had the usual options but with good quality food. Service was good. Car parking was by valet, very good service.
Highly recommended.",4,2019,01,09
202,Westin hotel dublin,"Just had one nite stay here. Excellent location for heart of dublin city visits. Friendly staff from front house to bar. Basement bar had chilled out atmosphere where forget the outside world and relax. We had room top floor nice and quiet.
",5,2019,01,06
202,Room for improvement,"I really enjoyed my stay- breakfast delicious with good choice of food. Beds extremely comfortable and room exactly what I booked. Quiet spacious room with little street noise. Courteous staff. Very central area. Lovely cosy ambiance to mezzanine.
But they seem to be trying to ensure non residents don't get access to bedrooms. Great security then? 
Well yes but if your key malfunctions while in the lift it won't move nor will the doors open. 
So try using stairs then? Well no there are only fire escape ones and the key doesn't open that door.
I dislike lifts and avoid where possible... There was no avoiding them at the westin though! At least non paying guests are kept out! I wouldn't return to this hotel.",4,2019,01,04
202,Excellent stay,"I stayed at this hotel a few days ago and what an amazing luxury hotel. We got upgraded to a Deluxe suite which was WOW. Great location (2-3 minutes walked from Temple Bar area) shopping, museums all close by, Luas tramline outside the door, very clean, smart and elegant decor and very friendly staff. Lovely help yourself breakfast. Would definitely stay here again",5,2019,01,04
202,Absolutely brilliant Christmas stay.,"We stayed at The Weston in Dublin over Christmas and from the minute we were greeted by the doorman to when we checked out, we enjoyed every minute in this very friendly, clean and beautifully decorated hotel. The food was delicious with the substantial breakfast setting us up for sightseeing. The bar staff are friendly and accommodating- making me a hot buttered rum that wasn‚Äôt on the cocktail list. Rooms all appear to be beautiful with their famous beds where we experienced the most deep restful sleep. Thank you to all the staff for everything. We highly recommend this hotel.",5,2018,12,31
202,Quick work visit ,"Very comfortable room. Great staff and porter service that always made sure I got taxis and what I needed.

Really nice decorated rooms and central to everything you need in dublin city 

Also very quiet rooms. 

",4,2018,12,28
202,Christmas stay - magical ,"The minute we opened our car after a long drive we were greeted by a member of staff who helped with our bags and until we left the Westin Hotel we were treated like royalty. The staff were courteous, friendly and so helpful.100% satisfaction!!!!!

The hotel is was full of Christmas Charm and it was a quaint home from home for our short visit. On Christmas Day we were delighted to meet SANTA in the lobby.  The hotel placed special Musical Gift boxes in our rooms and we will keep them for many years to come.  The restaurant was superb. I was delighted that we spent Christmas in the city ",5,2018,12,28
202,Fab location - good service during stay..but apple charger left in room was not found - poor mgt response.,"The Westin is blessed with a fabulous location - very close to Temple Bar (2-3 mins) for night life, Trinity College (1 min) for some culture and Grafton street (3 mins) for great shopping.The service was very good with all staff we encountered being very friendly and helpful. There is valet parking in an secure underground car park. The room was nice, very clean, but he queen sized bed was a bit too small for my wife and I (no Kings avail at this peak time and booked 1 day ahead of check in). Also of note was the fact that the bed was cambered to the centre - which was odd and uncomfortable.
Noise was not an issue. The mint bar was nice and service was good. The overall cost was ‚Ç¨295 for the room and 6 drinks in the bar - a bit pricey. My wife left her iphone charger in the room, but it seems to have not been found after 3 days !!!. This is disappointing as it was a high priced ipad charger -  3 days later still awaiting mgt to get back to us. The hotel has NOT been proactive after a daily call. In fact we keep getting diverted to a call centre when calling - a big disappointment. This is a 5 star hotel....but this service does not come close.",2,2018,12,24
202,Like an old friend,"I've stayed at this hotel many times and it never fails to impress. You're always assured of a warm welcome, a quiet room, a comfortable bed and a smooth departure. We requested a connecting room for our three children and it was large enough to accommodate two single beds and a third rollaway bed too. My children loved it and we all thoroughly enjoyed our stay. We're looking forward to our next visit already!",5,2018,12,19
202,Fantastic location,"The hotel is near Temple bar, loved the atrium where you can have a drink. The rooms are nice. Great location for shopping. Parking is 30 euros per day but well worth it. Breakfast room is lovely and breakfast is tasty",5,2018,12,18
202,Great central location although very busy at times,"This hotel has a great location within easy walking distance to many city tourist sites. The front desk staff member was very welcoming on our arrival happily volunteering a number of answers to questions we asked. 

Our room was very spacious and well maintained although showing a bit of age. The shower was probably the smallest I have come across in a leading hotel. We were on the first floor and did get some street noise during the night. The breakfast was good although not a particularly wide range.

The key aspect of the hotel I found offputting was the first two nights we stayed there there was multiple functions being held in-house and so the hotel restaurant was closed to in-house guests. It was so busy in the evenings that we were asked if we were attending an event when we arrived back from being out, with the implication that we should not have been there otherwise. This improved significantly on our final night and we were able to eat at the in-house restaurant that was very good.",4,2018,12,18
202,Great stay at Westin Dublin ,"My girlfriend and I were very impressed with the Westin. The service was exemplary. The room was extremely comfortable and had all the modern amenities that one might not expect to find. I would highly recommend this as a 4 star hotel
",5,2018,12,17
202,"Location, location, location","Fabulous hotel, staff and amenities in a central location.  Please be aware that due to the awesome location, set down and collection for passengers and taxis is around the corner not out front.  

Across the road from Temple Bar area and the Luas passes nearby in front of Trinity College across the road. We did the majority of exploration of Dublin on foot after a Ride on the Hop on hop off bus.

The rooms are well appointed and some acknowledgement to the age of the building as the room shape was not square and there was evidence of historical water damage to walls and carpet discolouration.  The WC also had a weak flush but overall a fantastic experience and nothing to diminish from the 4 stars well deserved.",4,2018,12,13
202,Great base to explore Dublin,"Just back from staying here for two nights last week in room 124. The room was spacious with really comfortable beds. It was also really quiet compared to the last hotel we stayed in whilst in Dublin. It‚Äôs really central and a good base to explore. The only issue I found was the woman who was the breakfast host working on Friday and Saturday morning as she didn‚Äôt have any time for us, sat us directly next to others when there were lots of other free tables and couldn‚Äôt even be bothered to ask us if we wanted any hot drinks. All the other staff were lovely and a special mention to great Irish sever who was running around helping everyone. He was great and even though he was rushed off his feet, was still smiling and chatted away to us. Maybe he should be front of house? Just an idea. Overall a great and the Christmas decorations were fab.",4,2018,12,11
202,Perfection,"This five-star hotel provides a five-star experience. The location, amenities, rooms, and decor are amazing but what really stayed with us was the service. No request was too big or small and often you didn't even need to ask for anything as everyone (from the doorman to the manager) was so attentive. This is not a budget hotel but the price is more than justified.",5,2018,12,11
202,Lovely comfortable stay,"We stayed in room 527 - the room was lovely, big, warm, clean & very comfortable. We only stayed for one night as we we were on a ‚Äúshopping‚Äù trip.  The hotel is excellently  located and the staff are very accommodating.  We didn‚Äôt eat in the hotel as we had made arrangements with friends.  We will definitely be back for a longer stay.",5,2018,12,10
202,We expected more from a 5* ,Very fast check in but thats all we got. The room was very dark and very small . the bathroom door wouldn‚Äôt close from outside which was difficult to keep the baby away from the slippery floors (only for family‚Äôs concern). We have emailed before we arrive and they confirmed the cot will be in the room but there wasn‚Äôt and they couldn‚Äôt find the email! The hotel had a ramp for pushchair but nobody ever at the door to help to open the door but they were all available at the checkout (off course) .parking was 30+ per night I found it very expensive.,3,2018,12,10
202,5 Stars - No Surprise,"Stayed just one night. Dinner was super, breakfast was super, location super, staff super, price super (meaning way up there). This is a 5 star hotel in the middle of a major city - it's never going to be cheap. Having said that, you get what you pay for. The location is the main asset, closely followed by the staff, who are the heartbeat of this place. Great music at the weekends too.
By the way, the bathroom lighting was the best I've ever witnessed - very important for ladies' make-up, hair, etc.",5,2018,12,04
202,Terrific Tea Time,"I highly recommend having afternoon tea at The Westin Dublin. Wonderful service. Festive setting. Beautiful, flower-garnished bites. My wife and I had a lovely time. It‚Äôs important to recharge after exploring Dublin all day. This is the place to do it.",5,2018,11,29
202,Beautiful hotel and great location ,"We were in Dublin for a family event and treated ourselves to a night at the Westin. The hotel and rooms were stunning and the staff were very helpful and friendly.
There was a problem with the water in the early hours but it was rectified by the morning but bottled water was provided free of charge.
They also have a great bar in the basement with a live band, who were amazing.
It‚Äôs not cheap but if you‚Äôre able to then treat yourself....it‚Äôs well worth a visit!",5,2018,11,21
202,"Beautiful Hotel, Terrible Wifi","This hotel is beautiful - it is placed in a historic building and is very well appointed.

The service is amazing and the location is fantastic... Until you need to connect.

The connection is slow to non-existent. Being there for work was very frustration because I could basically do nothing from the hotel. I found myself going to the office on the weekend just to be able to connect.

This is too bad, because I liked everything else about that hotel. But slow and unreliable connectivity is a no-go for me.",3,2018,11,21
202,Pleasent stay,"Situated right inside the heart of Dublin. All major sightseeing spots just a stonethrow away. Had booked directly via website and got a complementary upgrade to a deluxe room. Room was comfy and clean, a bit fair wear and tear, but not a big deal. Great coffee and tea-making facilities. Breakfast was excellent, a lot of fresh and local produce. Very helpful frontdesk staff and concierge.",5,2018,11,19
202,V v poor hotel,Booked a twin but was given a double room; got charged twice foe breakfast and told there system didnt link in with bookings.com and that was reason for both- no where near the quality of other good dublin hotels,1,2018,11,19
202,Wonderful Hotel and excellent location,"This hotel was amazing to stay in for our two night stay in Dublin. Within walking distance of a lot of things to do! The hotel staff was very helpful, especially when it came to decide where to go to eat, etc.! We stayed for our 1 year wedding anniversary and they recommended a wonderful place for dinner. The valet guys were great with our rental car (even though you don't need a rental car in Dublin) and the rooms were very clean and gorgeous. We stayed in one of the city side rooms! I would highly recommend staying in the hotel to anyone!",5,2018,11,18
202,My 9th stay,"I do love the location staff, rooms and service.

Rooms are OK, Had much better, but adequate.

The location for me has my return always guaranteed as it is steps to everyone I love about Dublin.

Food is good within and many great pubs right across the street",5,2018,11,14
202,"Small Rooms, Atrium view has no outside air and windows that don't open. Noise, Bugs and Safety issues","I travel for work at stay at the Westin regularly. Stayed should be more likely..
Classic Queen Room description should be:
- atrium view means there is no air from the outside, you cannot open windows towards internal covered courtyard and you can barely see if there is light outside or if it is dark. if you get a non-atrium classic queen room prepare to stare at a roof or wall.
- you will have connecting doors to other rooms ( locked) which in this case tried to be pushed to open at night (3am) by the resident in the nearby room. Hotel staff was not fazed and said neighbor a regular and must have tried to access bathroom door instead. Noise was of course an issue with such a connecting door. 
- 1 creepy crawly on the bathroom tiles in the morning to wake you up :) And also tiles are no longer grey but part brown. Probably due to time? cleanliness? spillage? 
Overall not a 5 star experience. Hotel staff could not have cared less.",2,2018,11,14
202,Just OK - Poor personal experience,"Dublin is a great, energizing city with the Westin occupying prime real estate a stones throw from the major tourist attractions.

With the Westin branding you are assured on what you will be receiving. A clean, generic and serviceable hotel. 

My major complaint is the actual room designs. We were given one of the interior rooms facing the interior courtyard. These rooms receive very minimal natural sunlight and are quite small. Almost cave like I would say.

The AC in my room did not work for 2 days, any adjustment and it simply put out some hissing. I requested the hotel to service the AC twice but to no avail. Still highly uncomfortable.

Although it is November, the room is still quite hot and stuffy. As the room faced the interior courtyard, had the option to open windows a bit however the room is directly above a bar and quite noisy. Basically impossible to sleep. One can literally hear any conversation.

Sorting through the TA reviews, seems to be a theme of the complaints. Be advised when booking.",3,2018,11,13
202,Absolutely perfect,"Stayed for 1 night last week.   Wow, what can i say this is a fantastic hotel.    Check in was exceptionally friendly and we were super lucky to get an upgrade on our room.   It was absolutely HUGE - 2 queen beds - fantastic size bathroom and just a pleasure to be in the room.   We ate in Moorlands Grill that evening and the restaurant manager and waiting staff could not have been nicer.   Lovely friendly welcome and very interested in their clients.   We had a very good nights sleep - no noise from street traffic.  Breakfast the next morning was again to a very high standard.

Overall really really enjoyed our visit to the Westin and cannot wait to return.",5,2018,11,12
202,City Peace,"Little Gem nestled away in the busy Dublin City. This charming building (and its doormen!) welcomed us with open arms, a lovely comforting and peaceful stay ‚Äì a nice escape from the hustle and bustle! 
The spacious and well-appointed bedrooms are so lovey and warm. Everything down to the curtains and pillow are luxurious. 

Unfortunately the property fell victim to a local water issue during our stay, which left us without water for a few hours ‚Äì beyond their control, however frustrating Im sure it was for both staff and guests! The staff however kindly provided bottled water and a complimentary breakfast for us (which was very nice) 

What really stood out was the customer service they followed up with after this happened. I have received an email from the General Manager explaining what exactly happened and they mentioned they are arranging a small gesture of apology for us. This is something I did not expect one bit ‚Äì especially as there was little they could do at the time as it wasn‚Äôt their fault! 

I wish to commend the Westin on how they handled this issue and on their exemplary Service/Staff and hospitality. Going beyond expectations to provide the 5 Star service that they deliver with class.  

Looking forward to a visit in the near future already!",5,2018,11,07
202,Beautiful Hotel,"My sister and I had afternoon tea in The Atrium. Wow, where to start!! The food was exquisite, the lounge was so comfortable and warm and the service were top class. We were made to feel so welcome. We had a fireside table which was very cozy. We had the botanical afternoon tea and oh my word I cannot fault any part of it. Highly recommended and we will most certainly return in the near future.",5,2018,11,06
202,Great location and staff,"The Westin Dublin is an upscale hotel with modern interior and spacious rooms. It's within walking distance of so many tourist attractions, which makes it so convenient. The staff are also friendly and very helpful.",5,2018,11,03
202,Deficiency of Housekeeping Services,"I was there for 2 nights, The second day Housekeeping walks in at 8am  the without any knock. I had to ask them to come in after an hour. Later the room was cleaned but the trash was not cleared. The milk,tea and coffee saches were not refilled. Even the body wash and shampoo had not been replaced. Called guest services at 7am, they were not sure when they can get it to me. Finally it did not come at all.  The iron board was not put back in place. Spent Euro760 for 2 nights not worth it when they are cutting corners on minimum standard service. The complimentary water bottle was not given.",3,2018,11,03
202,Great location in Dublin between Grafton Street and Temple Bar!!,"A little pricey compared to other Westins, but great location and nice sized rooms.  The Mint bar in hotel was wonderful for a cocktails and casual dinner.   Staff was very accommodating with directions and extra waters for the room.  ",4,2018,11,03
202,"Great Location, Not Much Charm","Two of us spent 3 nights at Westin Dublin, Sept 30 - Oct 2. The hotel is perfectly located as many of Dublins attractions (Temple Bar, EPIC Museum, Trinity College and even Guiness Storehouse) are within easy walking distance. The rooms are efficient and modern but a bit sterile and lack charm.Their breakfast provided many fresh tasty selections however on at least two mornings my silverware was so filthy it was as though they had reset the table using the utensils from the previous party. The Mint Bar on the lower level was fantastic as was the barkeep on duty the two evenings we partook and Kenneth their concierge was a terrific help. While situated in an ideal position for tourists this Westin is geared more toward business clientele.",4,2018,10,27
202,Perfect Location and Great Service,"We usually have high expectations when we stay at a Westin but this one exceeded those expectations. The location is perfect and it's easy walking distance to most of the things you want to see. There are tons of good restaurants and pubs around, too. The hotel service is spectacular and everyone is very personable. We enjoyed ending each night in the downstairs hotel bar called The Mint Bar. Very cool bartenders who were fun to talk to. I can't recommend this hotel enough.",5,2018,10,26
202,Not up to other Westin hotels,"First, the Westin in Dublin is in an absolutely perfect location. Down the block from Trinity College and Book of Kells.  Easy walk to Temple Bar, St Stephens Green, Dublin Castle and St Patrick's Cathedral.  But we have stayed in Westin hotels on three continents and this one doesn't seem to measure up.  Staff seemed trained to lie.  We arrived early in the morning.  We were told we could check in in an hour after a tour group left. Two hours later it was a different excuse.  We knew that check in was 3 pm but didn't appreciate the ""just for you"" that never happened.  This included a 2 pm upgrade promise that wasn't true at all.  Then the next day we returned to our room at 6 pm and the room had not been cleaned at all. Complaints were met with more excuses as to how difficult it was.  Needless to say, not our problem for this high price.  Breakfast buffet was good.",4,2018,10,24
202,short one night stay,"stayed at this hotel  for our ruby wedding anniversary the hotel is amazing the staff could not do enough for us(rose petals on the bed when we returned to the  room) A very good Jazz band on in the hotel bar when we returned on the Saturday night 
Breakfast was very good location excellent.
Just a first class hotel would defiantly stay again well done to the Westin",5,2018,10,22
202,Surprice Charge but Lovely Hotel,"We didn't originally intend to stay here but when our flat rental fell through and two of the five of us were already staying here (those first two with points), we decided to make life simple, and although it was a little high for our budget, booked two more same category rooms by phone directly with Westin. The hotel is elegant and well taken care of, the three rooms were all slightly different (according to the others as I only saw 2 of the rooms), although the one with points was smaller. Location is great, everything we required was within a short walk. Staff was friendly and welcoming. The downside, over half an hour to check out and the other 3 were heading to the airport so it was concerning. I noticed there were extra charges on our bill and asked if there were extra taxes and was advised that's what it was. Upon returning home I checked my confirmation and realized it wasn't taxes, they had upgraded the room and up charged us as well. It took a month of phone calls and emails to get a refund. Luckily I had email confirmations of what I was supposed to pay. So although it was a lovely stay, it left a sour taste when I had to argue the fact that I didn't know I was in an upgraded room. My advice, double check that they are putting you in the category you have confirmed.",4,2018,10,21
202,Platinum member on Honeymoon ,"This is a perfect location if you are looking for the absolute center of the city and Dublin Life. It is directly next to Trinity College and the Temple Bar district. Easy walking to Grafton St and Guinness. This place is well taken care of and has a great staff who done anything to keep you happy. I am a platinum member and am in a lot of Westin‚Äôs in the US and Europe. This place had me pleasantly surprised. The breakfast her is good, the rooms are nice and spacious. Hotel is kept clean and updated. This hotel does not have a platinum lounge if you are looking for one. Truthfully as well as it is located I don‚Äôt think it needs one with so many great pubs steps from the front door. I will be back again.",5,2018,10,21
202,The Perfect Location In Dublin,"Westin Hotel located in the heart of Dublin and anchored by Trinity College, Temple Bar, Grafton Street Shopping Area, National Museums of Ireland, Book of Kells, Dublin Castle, Christ Church Cathedral, St Patrick's Cathedral, and near the River Liffey.  We were pampered by the lively, friendly, well informed staff.  The Pub on the lower level was comfortable and had live music at night.  Rooms were high quality with very spacious bathrooms.  Morning breakfast were above expectations.",5,2018,10,21
202,On and off for almost two years ...,"The WD was home away from home whilst on business in Dublin for almost two years. Overall great property, in close proximity of Trinity College and Temple Bar. SPG platinum recognition was overall great, quite a few suite upgrades and little gestures that meant a lot. Breakfast is excellent too!

My favourite rooms would be those with views of the college, and have balconies/terraces. Most of these rooms are located on floors 4 and 5. Writers suites are lovely duplex rooms with separate living areas and some of them with balconies. Lastly, their presidential suite (or college suite) is superb, separate dinning area for up to 20 people, separate living room for entertaining guests, steam room, etc.

Staff always made sure they remembered regulars and they certainly made an effort to give us a warm welcoming. Anne Marie, Mo, Niamh, Steven and the rest will certainly be missed. 

All this property is missing is a nice indoor pool really. ",4,2018,10,20
202,Quick Business Trip with overnight Stay. ,"A great location in the heart of Dublin close to business areas, shops, bars and restaurants. Everything works well and rooms well appointed. Service of excellent standard. Good to see a new menu in the restaurant too especially for regular visitors. ",4,2018,10,19
202,Convenient  location and great service,"The hotel is close to City Centre, Trinity College and the shops / restaurants at Grafton Street. The hotel room was clean but the bathroom was too small with the toilet behind the door, and I had to close the door in other to use it. The staff is super friendly and accommodating. I selected a Make a Green Choice program and they cleaned my room on the 4 day and I had an option to get 5 eu or point or donate. 

4 stars because the gym machines' display only worked for games, not for TV or Radio, and this issue was not fixed during my stay.",4,2018,10,16
202,Fantastic Location !,"Location Location, and great service. This hotel is a central location and in the heart of Dublin. Nice rooms with all the services of a full service hotel. The concierge was very helpful and gave some great recommendations for sights and dining.",5,2018,10,14
202,"Great (A) location, but expensive with average (B) services and so-so (C) room conditions","5 stars for the location, 3 stars (hit or miss) for the services, 3 stars for  breakfast (nothing special). Hear good things about the hotel restaurants but did not try (and I will explain the reasons later in my review).
It started with ok checkin. The front desk rep seemed nice, though no room upgrade ( the hotel was busy with some business conference/meetings, and I don‚Äôt expect to have a suite upgrade but perhaps a better room would be nice, I am a Marriott lifetime Platinum Elite so some sweet surprises would be great, but nothing. so platinum members, don‚Äôt expect anything special from this Westin Dublin). The check in rep also promised to check if the hotel stocked some cold iced gel (medical treatment since I just strained my ankle before arriving to Dublin), she also promised to send an iced bucket to our room. She never called back to let us know if they have the medical kits or not, and of course the ice bucket never came. We had to call to request the ices after a long wait. 
Around 7 pm we would like to try the hotel restaurant, we called the front desk to ask if we need to make diner reservation (since I had a strained ankle I don‚Äôt want to wait so that‚Äôs why we wanted to call ahead). They told us, there is no need for reservation, just come down and walk in. We went downstairs, walked the stairs to their restaurant, and found out that their restaurant was all booked with their business event. Not a single apology! At that point, we were so disappointed, 5 stars hotel with 2 or best with 3 stars service?
About the room itself, we paid over $300 per night (corporate discount room rate, not counting vat, tax etc), the room was ok, small, one tiny window, the tv had limited channels, both bed reading lights did not work, the bathroom did not have any air circulation (aka, ‚Äúbad smells‚Äù would take a loooong time to make its way out of some where, perhaps to your bedroom :) ! )...
We stayed for 3 nights and only had a chance to have breakfast once, the buffet breakfast was ok, nothing to impress us (food quality and quantity are about 4 stars hotel level, Nothing special about the food but it indeed is expensive). The other day we asked for to-go (take out) breakfast since we had an early tour, wow it was nothing, just a banana and a very tiny danish in a bag ! Oh my gosh how much I miss my JW Marriott or Ritz-Carlton treatments! I am not sure if this Westin Dublin is presented the luxury Starwood or not (hey, they got very good reviews and highly rated !), but we as world travelers, it failed short of our expectations.
Now, enough of the negatives, let‚Äôs talk what‚Äôs good about this hotel ‚Äî
The location is super, right in the city center, next to Temple bar area, close to many major attractions. The outside building is beautiful. Their Mint bar is gorgeous ( the hotel was a bank before so this Mint bar was their bank vault originally). The front reception is small but warm and cozy with fireplaces... the door man was helpful. 
So, my conclusion? Next time we visit Dublin we will not stay with this Westin Dublin, there are several other hotels, perhaps we will check out the Shelbourne hotel instead. This Westin Dublin is not up to Starwood luxury standards, save your $$$ somewhere else. This hotel needs lots of improvements, in terms of services, of foods, and the room conditions!",3,2018,10,12
202,Perfect Hotel for Dublin Visit,"First time in Dublin and not sure where to stay?

The Westin Dublin is a great choice. Well located near all of the activities happening in Temple Bar; across the road from Trinity, and close to the river.

All in all a great 5 star property to base yourself at when visiting Dublin.",5,2018,10,11
202,Fantastic location,"The room was spacious, updated and very clean.  Housekeeping daily was thorough and prompt.  Guest services was friendly and helpful with an easy check in and check out.  The gym is great and also kept very clean.  The Mint was a convenient bar in the hotel that I won't rate very well as the service in there was not good all three times we visited with our group but I won't let that affect my overall rating of this property.  The location is perfect to access Temple Bar and all the other main shopping areas/parks and tours available.",5,2018,10,07
202,Slow Service.  Expensive 3 star quality hotel ,"This place has the slowest service.   The bell desk takes 30 minutes to deliver your luggage.  

The worst is the Morelands Restaurant.  From breakfast to dinner, the server(a) will chat and walk right past you.  I have to get the manager to come and take care of us.  There was one girl which is particularly bad.  I think she carry a discrimination attitude.    Although the food is ok but the service is unbearable.

This is a upscale Westin that charge over 500 euro per night.  They want to be an upscale hotel, then they should really retrain the staff to be more attentive and no attitude.    I have better service at the Sofitel Brussels , which is a 3 Star hotel.  This Westin is at  most a 3 star hotel( no spa, terrible dining experience, very slow service throughout the hotel)  but want to charge you a 5 Star price.....",2,2018,10,06
202,Great location near Trinity College / Grafton Shopping,"This was an excellent hotel with a large spacious room. 

The bed was heavenly, in fact it is the Westin Heavenly bed that you are able to purchase - we have one in Sydney. The in-room food was delivered hot from the restaurant and was tasty if a little bit pricey adding a ‚Ç¨7.5 delivery from downstairs to an already expensive meal. The wine was also over the top at ‚Ç¨41 for a bottle we purchased identically in Marks and Spencers on another day at ‚Ç¨11.5. 

The linen and towels were clean, soft and fluffy and the bathroom accessories included conditioner, which was missing from the Titanic, in Belfast. 

Breakfast was a good spread of buffet style. You would not go there especially, but included cold and hot food to cater for most tastes. A small downside was the officious attitude of Renee who did not want to let Liz in even though I was sitting there, being told that breakfast was finishing. Finally and begrudgingly, she let het look for me and somehow found me in the dining room which was not that big and I was actually waving. This girl may not be a good candidate for a job in hospitality. A small taste of bile in what was a very good experience. 

Everyone else on staff was friendly and helpful.  Finally, it is worth mentioning how lovely it was after braving the elements of the cooling down Dublin to walk into a foyer with a burning wood fire to greet us.

Recommend: Absolutely",5,2018,10,03
202,"Very friendly staff, unbeatable location","Just came back form a weekend stay in Dublin. Our stay was fantastic. Hotel is very well positioned in city center and everybody ion the hotel was very friendly and helpful starting with front desk girls, barmen and staff in the restaurant as well. Would highly recommend to stay.",5,2018,10,01
202,Ideal location and comfort ,You cannot go wrong with the Westin Dublin. The location is perfect walking distance to all the key attractions that Dublin has to offer. The rooms are charming and comfortable. Service is exactly what you would expect from a quality hotel brand like the Westin. If you want to treat yourself don‚Äôt hesitate! ,5,2018,09,29
202,Superior Location in an Historic Building,"As a loyal, long-time Starwood member (R.I.P), I chose the Westin Dublin for a extended weekend stay with my college-aged daughter. The double, single bed accessible room was spacious and comfortable. While it was nice to have a well-sized, European room, the television is too small and too far away from the beds to be sensibly viewed. The bathrooms are also a good size, but fair warning...if you're over 6' feet tall, you may feel claustrophobic climbing into the accessible tub to take a shower.

The two best things about the Westin Dublin are its ideal location and very friendly and helpful staff. I didn't realize when I booked it, but the hotel provides easy access to the lively O'Connell Boulevard and Temple Bar districts, sits right next to Trinity College, and is only a short walk to bus and light rail (right outside the door) transportation options. I used the concierge desk to rent-a-car for the day, make change, and suggest off-the-beaten path destinations and places to eat. If we return to Dublin, I'm sure we'd strongly consider staying here again.",4,2018,09,27
202,Great location,"Our room was not great as we had no view due to a part of the building being directly outside our room, but luckily the room we gave to my parents had a great view overlooking the street and the edge of Trinity College.  The Westin is in a great location to wander around Dublin and never be far from where you are staying.",5,2018,09,25
202,The Place To Be,"This is the ideal place to be to visit Dublin. The hotel staff is very welcoming and makes you feel right at home from the beginning--Lisa at Registration set the tone for a wonderful five days. The hotel is located across the street from Trinity College and is minutes walk to the Temple Bar and Grafton Street areas.The atmosphere in the area is dynamic with tourists mingling with the everyday workers go to and from work. While the area may be busy, the hotel is a respite from it all. The room was spacious and very comfortable with the right amenities and enough drawer space for a few days.
The staff is first class--other hotels should send their staff there to learn how to treat guests! A strong shout out to Alan at the door:  forget guidebooks, just ask Alan!!",5,2018,09,23
202,Perfection ,"My fiancee and I stayed here in Jan 2018. Unbeknownst to me he had informed the hotel ahead of our arrival that he would be proposing during our stay in Dublin. When we arrived they upgraded us to a suite but were extremely subtle about it all- I had no idea! 

We left the hotel and when we arrived back (they knew when he was going to propose) they had left desserts with congratulations written on them in the room. It was these little touches that made the stay so perfect. 

The location was perfect and within a very short walking distance to Trinity College. The staff were amazing and attentive. The hotel is beautiful in every way. When we arrived they had a roaring fire burning in the reception area which just gave the place a home feel. The rooms are big and spacious, they are traditional and yet modern and have great facilities. Despite being in the centre of Dublin it was extremely quiet. The breakfast was to such a high quality and had great choice. I would say it‚Äôs probably one of the best breakfast buffets I have ever had in a hotel. 

I would highly recommend this hotel and don‚Äôt have a bad word to stay about it. 

",5,2018,09,23
202,Timeless ,"I believe the main attraction for The Westin is the location. Right in the heart of the lively Dublin City Centre, minutes from Grafton Street and basically everything. 
Iva checked me in late at night and checked me out early the next day. She was extremely professional and efficient and talked me in to booking breakfast at a better rate with her. More about the breakfast later!
The room was on the small side but the highlight was the super soft and extra lush bed. The bathroom was classically finished in white with a bathtub and integrated shower. The toiletries provided unfortunately left my skin very dry but this is something minor. The room and facilities surrounding where very clean and the noise from the agent street was blocked out. The functional working desk and cables where great for charging several devises. WiFi was also functional. 
In the morning I had a wake up call set for 7am which worked absolutely great! There was someone who personally came to the door to ensure I was awake. Now that‚Äôs service! I used the small but extremely function gym and could enjoy a morning work out. 
I was delighted that I used the gym facilities as the breakfast served was exemplary. Fresh smoothies, pastries, tea, cooked breakfast, eggs, cheeses, cereals, fruits, breads and of course not forgetting the Irish breakfast ensured a marvelous start to the day. You really can‚Äôt miss out on the breakfast and I advise booking it at check in. 
Compliments goes again to Iva as well as her colleagues in the breakfast dining area. I really enjoyed this unfortunately short stay but hope to come back in October. Highly recommended and can‚Äôt wait to return. 
The only thing I would highlight and was completely surprised is that you can no longer pull up right outside The Westin. Taxis and limousines must drive and park to the right hand side street of the hotel which is very strange for a five star hotel. The reason being is they laid a new Luas Tram line right at the front of the hotel of which Marriott and Dublin City Council should have better thought out as I can imagine some top guest wouldn‚Äôt be too happy about this and doesn‚Äôt give the true door-to-door feeling.  
",5,2018,09,22
202,Acceptable,"Staff should have been more responsive. Had to wait almost 2 hours for luggage to be delivered after check in, and room was not serviced the next day until after 4:00 p.m. , which apparently is common for the large hotels in Ireland.
The manager did apologize and sent cheese and wine to make up for inconveniences.  It was a nice location in Dublin and restaurant was very nice.",3,2018,09,21
202,Great Hotel with Great Location,"Recently stayed here with my wife.  I don't think I could have picked a better hotel to stay at in Dublin.  It is elegant and quite charming. The staff is very helpful!  I especially enjoyed a young doorman who was from Italy.  One of the most friendliest people I have ever met.  From the time I arrived at the hotel until we left, his exuberant personality made him a great spokesman and representative for this hotel.  The buffet breakfast was excellent although the service for things like coffee or any items not on the buffet bar was slow.  The room and bathroom were very nice and clean.  The location could not have been better.  It is a short walk to the very active Temple Bar area as well as Trinity College.  I would highly recommend this hotel.  We hopefully will return to Dublin.  If so, there is no doubt where we will stay!",5,2018,09,21
202,Best location in Dublin and 4-star oasis,"After traveling the west counties and staying in delightful but limited small inns/ b&bs what a treat to check in to the Weston Dublin! Yes, those heavenly beds! Yay for menus with Euro/north american/Irish options! The sophisticated Mint Bar a treat for all the senses with creative, custom cocktails and elegant, unique decor.

This reliably great hotel really excels with staff quality...doormen & concierge team in top form with patient guidance for newcomers to Dublin. All staff delivering Irish hospitality with effortless grace to sometimes clueless and clumsy guests like our party.

Thanks for a great stay! 

Oh, chosen in part for location and it did not disappoint! Walk to everything you want to see, short ride to Kilmainham.",5,2018,09,21
202,BEST LUXURY  HOTEL WITH BEST LOCATION,"BEST HOTEL IN DUBLIN - TICKS ALL THE BOXES 
Booked a group stay 100 delegates from Australia for 5 days / 4 nights 
Location is the best of any hotel in Dublin for exploring, so easy to walk to everything next door to Trinity college, across the road in the Temple Bar precinct and Grafton St 2 blocks away.
Hard to please 100 delegates but the Westin Hotel did exactly that, Flawless group experience, the Westin Dublin under promised but OVER DELIVERED in every aspect of hospitality.

202,Great stay on a memorable weekend,"We stayed on the Sat nite of the All Ireland Hurling final weekend . 3 brothers in the one room, who had converged from far flung places . The staff from the moment we arrived with the car to the Sunday evening were all outstanding , courteous friendly and helpful.
Of course we frequented the bar which was perfect as we were meeting up with a lot of old friends . Perfect location right in the city centre . Breakfast was excellent . Result of the game capped off a great weekend.",4,2018,09,19
202,Great location and a beautiful property ,First you have to get over the price but we used points and that seemed to be a great value! Great location to most attractions. The hotel is beautiful and the Mint Bar downstairs is excellent. Definitely will be back. ,4,2018,09,16
202,Disappointing ,"Just returned from a 2 night stay.
Let‚Äôs just say this was my worst experience in Ireland. The only thing it has going for it is the location. 
The hotel is more like a low 4 star than a 5 star.
Check in front desk were super unfriendly. 
Room was atrocious. My view was directly into an office building. Room was dark,and very basic.
The television had 10 stations, only American choice was Bloomberg.
I was in room 432 and I‚Äôm attaching a picture of the view.
Thanks to Stephen and the other bell caps.
They were the best part of hotel.

Stay at The Shelbourne! Amazing hotel.

",2,2018,09,15
202,Probably an off day for staff,"Hotel a bit ""tired"".  Rooms were ok but clean and comfortable.  Shower was small and had a bit of a hard time adjusting water temperature.  Service at reception was ok. Breakfast was very nice.  Did not notice any special treatment for an SPG gold member which was a bit disappointing.",3,2018,09,14
202,Fawlty Towers with a Slight Brogue,"The hotel is in a wonderful location, just across from the Temple Bar area, in close walking distance to Trinity College, Dublin Castle, and many other Dublin sites. The rooms are comfortable--though we were given a smaller room than the deluxe room we had booked. The decor in the hotel is a bit dark and stuffy. The main downfall is the staff, who ranged from bumblingly unhelpful to snooty and curt. When we arrived early in the AM, fully expecting that our rooms would not be ready, we hoped for a courtesy suite in which we could freshen up. No dice. We were sent to a rather dank fitness suite, where the toilet was dramatically clogged. The staff could not have cared less. Getting our bags stored was something of a circus. Once we did get rooms (again, not those we had booked and paid for), there were ongoing issues with heating and cooling. The keys regularly didn't work, so we did hundreds upon hundreds of steps to sort that over and over. One bright spot was a driver service sort of arranged by the concierge. We'd called weeks in advance to arrange day trips with a driver. The concierge assured us it had been booked. When we came down in the morning, the driver was not there. The morning concierge took the matter in hand, and after a short while, our wonderful driver Ben arrived. We later learned the the booking concierge had not called the agency to confirm, and his email had gone into spam. The booking agent, Brian, scrambled to find us Ben, who turned out to be the blessing of the trip. With great charm, wit, and patience, he took the four of us on wonderful sojourns to the Cliffs of Moher, Cahir Castle, the Rock of Castle, Kilkenny Castle, Corcomroe Abbey, and more. Our two day trips with Ben were the delight of our visit, and we're so grateful to Brian for sorting out the bumbling arrangements made by the hotel staff. Brian became a quick family friend, and we were honored to learn about his life, family, and general perspectives on all things Irish. So, it turned out that getting out of the hotel, thanks to Brian and Ben, was the best thing about the hotel. Next best: the bar, which had lively entertainment and a robust library of spirits.",3,2018,09,13
202,Great Location,"This hotel is located close to shopping and the Temple Bar area. Nice rooms and friendly service. The buffet breakfast is the normal, nothing special. Room safe‚Äôs are in each room. Beds are comfortable and Wi-Fi is free. ",5,2018,09,08
202,An Enjoyable Stay,"I stayed in this hotel for one week on a recent business trip.  
The location of this hotel is ideal.  It is close to the trinity college, river liffey, Temple Bar area, the Grafton shopping district, etc.  It is also by the green line Luas stop, which is convenient for taking public transportation. 

The room is very spacious.  The staff are all very friendly.",5,2018,09,07
202,Nice & dependable ,"I chose the Westin for its location as it was situated right next to Trinity college. 
My stay was comfortable with no major issues. The reception staff were very friendly & accommodating.  I had forgotten how a Heavenly bed feels as it has been a while since I stayed at a Westin. My room overlooked the atrium and any concerns I had about noise levels were unfounded.  I've booked my return visit already. 
That said the Westin in Boston remains my favourite. 

",4,2018,09,07
202,Could not have asked for a better experience,"Everything about my stay was wonderful. Even before I arrived, the hotel blast-emailed all guests about expected road closures near the hotel due to the papal visit. When we arrive, the front desk staff was able to get us into our room before standard check-in to accommodate my jet-jagged husband. The bed in the room was one of the most comfortable I've ever slept in. The in-room safe was big enough for both of our laptops plus cash and other valuables. The folks at the concierge desk always had restaurant recommendations and directions and were able to print our airlink tickets. If I had to find one area where they could improve it would be in the availability of USB charging ports - there was one at the desk. But that's such a small issue, it hardly impacted us at all.",5,2018,09,05
202,"Great Hotel, Central to all tourist attractions","Stayed at this hotel after a disappointing 1st night stay of a 2 night weekend at the Handels Hotel Temple Bar.  Was pleased beyond words at the room that was provided by the Westin.  Great room size, comfortable bed, lots of pillows and huge washroom.  The hotel is also equipped with Air Conditioning which is a plus.  Normally not required in Dublin, however after this past summer heat wave, definitely want to ensure you book a room with one.  Everything from check-in to check-out went smoothly.  Received a late check-out until 2pm so we could enjoy our last day in the city before heading to the airport.  If returning, I would definitely come back.",5,2018,09,02
202,Still Waiting,"I arrived a few days after the rest of my group. Arrived at the hotel this morning about 9am and was told that my room was ready. I was given the key and went to my room. Received a call from the desk a few minutes later and they said that they put me in the wrong room, and my room was supposed to be bigger/nicer. I told them that I just wanted to sleep and this room is fine. They assured me it would only be a short time until my room was ready and it was being cleaned. I went to breakfast, walked around the city for a little bit...stopping back twice to check on it. Now it is 2 1/2 hours later and the manager assured me that housekeeping is cleaning my room now and it will be ready in 15-30 minutes. The same that I was told more than 2 hours ago. Not impressed with the staff and their lack of honesty and integrity. ",3,2018,08,31
202,From an old bank to a a 4* hotel,"You couldn't be more central to the old & new Dublin.  Just across the street from the Trinity College, shopping on Grafton Street, and Pubs on Temple Bar.  The hotel offers ample size rooms, good service and breakfast in the 1863 bank which has been total restored.",5,2018,08,30
202,Perfect for City Centre Hen Party Afternoon Tea,"From the start of the booking process to the post event 'how did everything go?' email, Kelly and the whole team too great care of us. Organising a hen can be a bit stressful but they were very patient with all my various queries and requests. 

We booked a private suite to have afternoon tea and host our activity, which was such the perfect idea. The table layout was beautiful and there was AV facilities so we could project a slideshow of photos of the bride to be, and play our own playlists. The only thing that would have made that slightly better would have been blue tooth speakers, I had to leave my phone plugged in which meant I couldn't take photos but I got to do more posing!

The afternoon tea was exquisite as usual with very careful consideration given to the special dietary requirements. We had a few servers taking care of us and they were also super patient and efficient. It made for a really relaxed day, when it came time to move on to our next stop, no one really wanted to leave. Highly recommend it for Afternoon Tea or for an event, huge thank you again to all! ",5,2018,08,29
202,Beyond Amazing!,"I can't rave enough about this hotel. It couldn't be in a better location! You can walk to so many place from here or take the light rail. I was lucky to stay in the two level wrap around suite and it was the stay of a lifetime. The staff was so professional from the servers to the bellhop. Every time I hear the song by Andy Grammar that says ""And we spent the weekend pacing the hotel room at The Westin in Dublin, never felt so close to you"" I just smile because it was such a neat hotel, pricey, but awesome.",5,2018,08,27
202,An Atrium lunch - surprisingly average,"I used to be quite a regular here and was happy to book it again even after a very long break, based on my memories of a good place to lunch with good service and good food.
Alas, that was not my experience on this visit.
The service was detached, disengaged, slow and heading towards a grudging indifference. It took quite a while to get our order taken and then to get some glasses of water.
The food also took quite a while to arrive, which was s surprise for simple open crab sandwiches.
We had one portion of French fries, a glass of wine and one coffee.
It all seemed a chore!
Average quality, not at all flavoursome. Not good value at about ‚Ç¨46.
In spite of my past good memories, I don't think I'll return for more indifference and not very good food.",3,2018,08,26
202,Luxury business stay,"I stayed here for 1 week whilst on business for 3 weeks.
Check in was friendly and efficient.
The room was located in a quiet corner of the floor and was a great size offering plenty of storage space.
The king size bed was delightfully comfortable.
The hotel is located a stones throw from the Temple Bar area and within easy walking distance of most bars & restaurants as well as the main shopping district.
Needless to say I was a little annoyed I couldn‚Äôt spend the duration of 3 weeks here.
",5,2018,08,23
202,Luxury in the city,"Stayed at the westin recently and the hotel was beautiful, a very grand entrance with a luxurious feel throughout. The room was nice, however a little cramped with one or two pieces of furniture too many. I can‚Äôt speak for value for money as this was a free night stay for me, however the food at breakfast and the staff were wonderful. Would definitely recommend the westin!",4,2018,08,20
202,Fantastic location and great rooms,"We treated ourselves to a stay here at the end of our Ireland holiday.  It is expensive and using some of our SPG points certainly helped.  We had one deluxe and one Writer room - but we were nicely upgraded from our Writer room to a Suite.

One arrival - we caught a taxi form our rental car drop-off to the hotel and we were pleased we had a taxi who knew the area well because vehicle access to the hotel is problematic.  The taxi rank is to the side but it all worked brilliantly.  

Check in was prompt and friendly with a ""welcome back"" to my husband who is the SPG member.  I would say that it would have been worthwhile telling us that we had a upgrade.  We assumed so when we saw the room but I think it is nice of the hotel can get some credit for doing something nice.  They had also kindly given us rooms close to each other.

The room appointments were very comfortable and a little bit grand.  We did not use any of the hotel facilities apart form Concierge to book a departing taxi so we cannot comment on other services.  However you can't beat the location and if the budget allowed we would certainly return.",5,2018,08,19
202,The Best Possible Location,"This was my first trip to Dublin and as a Platinum with Marriott used points for the best situated property in Dublin.  It turned out to be better than I could have imagined.  The Airlink Express drops off and picks up a half block from the hotel and does the Dublin Green Hop on and Hop off bus.  This hotel is in the middle of everything.

I was told we had an upgraded room overlooking Trinity College.  It was a corner room with lots of and a decent size for Europe.  Beautifully furnished.  The bathroom was the best on a two week trip but as with every hotel - the lighting was horrible.  Who designs the lighting in these bathrooms????  This was the first glass inclosure in 5 hotels over 2.5 weeks that did not leak and flood the floor!!!  Yeah. 

Since this hotel is on a busy corner in downtown (windows very sound proof at least on the 4th floor) I can imagine that some rooms do not have any view at all.

No Executive Lounge in this hotel but they give your breakfast in their restaurant and it was very nice.  Staff was friendly and helpful.  I would stay here again on my next visit to Dublin.  By the way. . . two must sees - the Guinness Brewery (amazing presentation)  and The EPIC Emigration Museum (incredible presentation about Irish history - a must see).",5,2018,08,19
202,Central location with pleasant Staff,"Great rooms, get one with the larger format, as allows for a small living area that works great for families who may travel together, and want a central relax spot to visit together. Short walk to many great spots like Whiskey Museum, Guiness, and shopping/restaurants.",5,2018,08,18
202,Great hotel,"Very nice hotel, great central location. Staff were very attentive, with complimentary water bottles & towels in the lobby as there was a heatwave in Dublin.

Room was nice & big with a good desk area for working. Be careful opening the curtains as I didn‚Äôt realise my room faced onto an internal atrium, luckily I was clothed!

No parking at or very near to the hotel which is the same with most city centre hotels, there is valet parking option but it can take 15-20 mins to get your car back.

Would recommend this hotel.",5,2018,08,10
202,"Great Hotel, Perfect Location","This is a great hotel located right in the city center and accessible to pretty much everything. We stayed there in December and it was decorated beautifully for the holidays, with the fireplaces going in the lobby to give it an extra cozy feel.
The room was wonderful - clean, spacious and up to date. Our room did face the busy street, so we could hear quite a bit of noise especially on Saturday which is when it gets pretty rowdy in town. It wasn't a huge issue for us, but if you're a light sleeper you may want to ask for a room on the opposite side of the building.
The concierge was very helpful when we needed information on tours, nearby attractions and food suggestions. Only thing I'll say is there wasn't always somebody available and we would have to wait a few minutes until someone showed up.
All in all it was a great stay, and I would recommend this hotel to anyone! The location really can't be beat.",4,2018,08,08
202,Splendid!,"Loved everything about this hotel. The design, service, surroundings are simply superb. Have high tea and meander over to Trinity College to see the Book of Kells.  The location allows you to walk to many of the best Dublin historic and trendy sites.",5,2018,08,07
202,Paradise,"I loved my stay at the Westin! Beautiful building. A little hard to navigate for people like me who are terrified of taking stairs, but I love an adventure. My bathroom was huge and clean. I actually had enough pillows, which is a big win when in Europe. My one complaint though, as a one month + traveller, the laundry is too expensive. Ran out of clean underwear and found it was cheaper to buy new ones than have mine laundered :/",5,2018,08,01
202,"Nice Property, great location","Well Dublin is ludicrously expensive in my opinion.  It's difficult to feel like you're getting good value for money.

The Westin is a great location and the staff at the concierge were very helpful for assisting me to do the activities I had planned.

Breakfast was a bit hit and miss.  They seemed to be very busy in terms of how quickly it took staff to seat me and the eggs I ordered being delivered, yet if I looked around the room, it wasn't that busy at all.  When I was there there was an entitled pig of an older ""gentleman"" who pushed past everyone else and insisted that he and his wife be seated as they were ""in a hurry"".  I later watched them laze over breakfast for an hour. I must commend the hostess for not losing her temper with him, however it was disappointing to see that she essentially let him cut the line and gave in to his bully behaviour instead of making him wait behind those of us who were there first.

My room was comfortable and I enjoyed the inroom massage which is provided as a third party service, there's no full service spa.

The hotel was very full when I stayed so I was able to be afforded much of an upgrade for my platinum status, which I totally understand.  I was sent up a lovely tray of amenities, which was a special request from my ambassador and I really appreciated the hotel going to such an effort.

I would recommend this hotel with the tip that you might want to go down to breakfast five minutes earlier than planned in case there is a wait or entitled person cutting the queue.",5,2018,07,30
202,Great hotel with wonderful service,"Talk about a superior hotel in a big city, well this is it. The location is perfect for all of the sights of Dublin, but not near the madness of Temple Bar area (although that was fun too). From check in to check out everything was very well done. Great food in the upscale restaurant, The downstairs bar was lively and had an increasable band playing top 40 music, which was a very nice change! 

The only drawback is that it is very expensive! But you get what you pay for in this case.",5,2018,07,30
202,Great Hotel!,"This hotel was perfectly located for wanting to walk around Dublin. It was steps away from Temple Bar and Grafton Street in the other direction. The staff was super-friendly, and the hotel amenities were perfect. We enjoyed our stay very much!",5,2018,07,29
202,Great location ,"The pros: great location across the street from the Temple Bar area, and easy walking to Grafton Street, Merrion Square and Trinity College. Lots of nearby restaurants and pubs, and the area seems relatively safe. Common areas of the hotel are very nice, particularly the Mint Bar.

The cons: our room wasn't ready until nearly 4pm on a Friday. There was a used soap and towel in the shower. I immediately asked the bellman who brought us up to have it removed and he was very apologetic.   We did notice during our 3 night stay that housekeeping was a bit lax .. ie, room service items left in the halls for hours.

Overall it was a good stay and staff was very friendly - especially the doorman- and earned a 4 in my book.",4,2018,07,27
202,Very nice hotel in an excellent location,"This property is located on the main road, directly across the street from the Temple Bar area.  

Lobby is clean and nice, just like you would expect from a Westin.  Checkin was simple.  I am gold status, but unfortunately the hotel was full, so i could not receive a room upgrade.

The room was of decent size for an urban hotel (not huge), with a nice desk, good internet connectivity, clean bathroom with excellent water pressure.

Breakfast was included in my package, and there was a very nice buffet spread in the morning (tons of options including scrambled eggs etc).  If you wanted to order omelettes, etc that was an extra charge.",5,2018,07,26
202,Not what I would expect from a Westin,"While the location of the hotel is perfect for walking we had to walk a bit to use public transportation for most activities south of the facility. Upon arrival we discovered the room refrigerator did not work and when we called about it we were told it was after 5:00pm and that maintenance had gone home for the day. After a bit of insistence that we needed one a man came to the room and said there was nothing he could do. The conversation became a bit warm and he agreed to bring another fridge and then set it beside a dresser. It stayed that way for over three days even with another call to the front desk for someone to fix the built in unit. The bathtub had numerous chips in it and the window looking outside had a large area of bird dung pasted on it (sick to look at).  Overall, it appeared to me that customer service was significantly less than at any other SPG facility I have stayed. It is not likely that I will use this Westin in the future. I'm not sure how it received a five star rating. Unfortunately, this is what I walked away with and not the great bellman or other areas that should have been locked in my mind.",2,2018,07,26
202,Wonderful!,"Everything was fantastic- the food (fruit smoothies, yum), the service (concierge, Mo was very helpful), the rooms (spacious, comfy beds, & blackout curtains)- they were all top notch! Great location besides all of that!!",5,2018,07,24
202,Dublin Elegance,"Sheer class and best hotel location in Dublin.  Pricey but I appreciate that it is a Starwoods Preferred Guest property, and, since I try to come to Dublin every year, I save points just to stay at this most elegant venue. Rooms are always pristine, staff is very attentive to every need.  Right next to Temple Bar and Trinity College.",5,2018,07,23
202,Great Hotel,"This hotel is in a great location. It is right next to Trinity, across from Fleet Street and walking distance to most of the museums as well as Christ Church, St Patrick's, and the Dublin Castle. The staff were excellent and helpful. The facility is beautiful, and our room was wonderful. They were having a heat wave while we were there and I have to say it was one of the few places where the AC was working well. They also have a great little bar in the basement called the mint- excellent drinks. We really enjoyed our stay while we were here.",5,2018,07,22
202,Superb Location,"We stayed here on a recent visit back to Ireland and this hotel reminded us why we prefer to stay at Westin hotels when we travel.

Excellent service throughout our stay from the staff, they even posted some letters for me, after providing me with envelopes :) We had an excellent room on the 5th floor with a heavenly bed (Westin do beds like no other hotel, so comfortable and we always have a great sleep).

The gym is also very good with sufficient space and very good equipment - it has all the standard machines but the highlight for me was the kettlebells, which not all hotels provide.

Finally, the location is incredible - right on College Green, beside Trinity and a 5 minute walk from Grafton Street.",5,2018,07,21
202,"Location, location, location.","Location is always touted as the number one factor for real estate, and it is had to beat the location for the Westin Dublin.  Across the street one direction is Trinity College.  Across another direction is the Temple Bar district.  The main commercial district is a couple of blocks away.  You are clearly in the heart of Dublin.

The hotel itself is a fairly typical upscale city hotel.  Service is refined and ever-present.  Rooms are a bit cozy, but very well appointed.  We reserved a deluxe king, and I was a bit surprised by it size (or lack thereof) and interior courtyard view, which didn‚Äôt match the website description of 30-40 sq meters and ‚Äúnatural light from windows that overlook Dublin‚Äôs bustling streets.‚Äù  But the courtyard bar below apparently is not a hotspot and closes fairly early providing us with a quiet neighbor.  

Amenities (such as coffee/tea service) are cleverly hidden, but accessible.  The marble bathroom was outfitted with everything you might want including separate tub and shower.  The only thing missing was a separate bar of soap for the sink and shower or tub.

The breakfast buffet was fabulous and included a wide range of choices, including made-to-order choices.  Not too badly priced if you pre-purchase upon check-in.

We only stayed one night pre-cruise, but would definitely consider staying again if our travels take us back to Dublin.  I would comment that the Westin is a bit pricy, but that seemed to be the norm in central Dublin.  Would recommend.",4,2018,07,18
202,Great,"Stayed here four nights.  Assumed it would be ok, adequate, but that‚Äôs it.  I was pleasantly surprised.  The location is great, very central and right at the edge of Temple Bar area.

I am a Platinum member.  I don‚Äôt believe we received much of an upgrade. Our room was Average size and location just ok.  But the room and common areas were all new in appearance, and very clean.  Breakfast each morning was excellent. 

Service here was great.  I highly recommend the Westin Dublin. ",5,2018,07,16
202,Solid hotel with all facilities you need ,"The Westin Dublin is definitely a good option in Dublin. Location is perfect to explore the city, the hotel breakfast is complete and delicious and the same restaurant gave me one of the best fish&chips I ever had. 

Business facilities are good and staff was attentive. 

The standard room is great. Very comfortable, not luxurious. Shower could be better, but was ok. 

It was not a memorable stay if I compared with other 5star hotels in the globe. But a great option to stay in Dublin. ",4,2018,07,16
202,The Petfect Location With Luxury Accommodations,"The Weston is located very close (block or 2) to Trinity College (which is considered English land) and a block from the Temple Bar area.   It‚Äôs location was perfect for exploring downtown Dublin.  Walking distance to Dublin Castle, Ha‚ÄôPenny Bridge and the Guinness Factory.  Rooms are love,y and very comfortable.   Air conditioning to keep you cool and comfy on those rare, warm days.  Highly recommend this hotel for even the most exacting traveler.  Lovely breakfast was included with the room.  You will not be disappointed.",5,2018,07,13
202,Michael Buble Concert,We had originally booked the Morgan Hotel for the night but received an email the week before to say the renovation's would not be complete so we were upgraded to their sister hotel the Westin. We had a fabulous stay. We decided to eat in the bar downstairs. The good was really good & very reasonably priced. I had a non alcoholic cocktail & it was delicious. The room was small but very comfortable. Very enjoyable stay in a great location. We had a city view.,5,2018,07,10
202,Perfectly located,"Perfectly located across from Trinity college. The rooms were well-appointed and spacious. Nice atrium bar/restaurant. When you check in, you may be offered the chance to add breakfast each morning for about $12/person. We did this and we‚Äôre glad we did. There was both a large buffet and the option to order freshly prepared food. It was very good and there were lots of selections. Great way to fuel up for a day of sightseeing. ",4,2018,07,07
202,Friends birthday,Stayed here for my friends birthday. Really beautiful. Went for afternoon tea on the Sunday which was really special. All hotel staff were really friendly and helpful. Rooms were spacious and location was great for shopping,5,2018,07,06
202,Westin,"Very centrally located and easy to walk to Trinity College, Temple area and shopping. Hotel staff very helpful with directions. Service was great. Breakfast buffet was exceptional. Very safe area of town. 
I definitely would stay here next time in Dublin. The building is an old bank so all the areas have bank names. ",5,2018,07,06
202,Great location,"The heavenly bed is simply the best and this hotel is in a great location. It is very close to Trinity College and within easy walking distance of tons of attractions.

We walked to the Gaiety Theater to see Riverdance and the area between was still bustling with activity at 10:30 PM. Lots of restaurants, a Murphy's ice cream nearby. Great vibe in the area.",5,2018,07,04
202,Perfect weekend break,"Stayed here with a friend for the weekend and had a great stay. The location is great, right by Trinity college and book of Kells exhibition...

All of the key places in Dublin are close by and within easy walking distance. Right over the road is the main stop for the hop on hop off bus and a short walk away is Temple Quay. 

The hotel is really nice, comfortable and recently renovated. Feels like real luxury. The roaring open fires in reception give a homely feel and the bar and restaurant were very nice. 

Breakfast was incredible. Such a great choice, everything so fresh and lots of hot and cold options. 

Would love to stay here again, great hotel. ",4,2018,07,04
202,Less than friendly staff ,"Arrived from USA early AM after overnight flight, at hotel 6:30 am... understanding it was early but no one outside or in entrance to greet us, person checking us in was  not the least bit friendly.  She stated there was no room available which we understood but were exhausted and just wanted a place to close our eyes for a few minutes.  She said the atrium was not open so there was no where to go.  We had to rest on a chair in the hallway to recharge and then feel awake enough to start our day.  After asking her about coffee/ breakfast she finally did offer us  complimentary  breakfast.  
As a platinum member when available hotels will also offer us an upgrade, this was not available when room was ready we were in one that faced an office building that they good see directly in to our room.  
Room was nice, staff not so friendly except for the concierge ( can‚Äôt remember his full name but started with an L) he was especially warm to us.  
Breakfast was very nice but staff inefficient and very unfriendly.

Loved the location but for a Westin which is typically a nice, high quality stay we were a bit disappointed.",3,2018,07,04
202,Great Location,We stayed for a few nights on our trip the Ireland. The rooms are a good size and in good condition.  The location is right in the middle of the city. The staff is very helpful.   We were surprised that breakfast was not included for Starwood Gold members. ,4,2018,06,29
202,"Location, Luxury, Lovely","We were part of a tour group that clearly gets star treatment as our room was stocked with lots of little goodies when we checked in.  That aside, our room was extraordinarily quiet, well-outfitted and nicely maintained.  This is clearly an old building but with all the modern amenities, including fast internet and tight security.  

The staff were wonderful, as people generally seem to be in Dublin.  Our room on the 4th floor had zero view (we looked out on a roof), but we never heard a sound except an occasional voice in the hallway (perfect for us actually).

The hotel is conveniently located in the center of everything with ample transportation options, including Uber, walking, trams, buses, etc. all nearby.  The Temple Bar, Trinity College and Grafton Street areas are easy walks from this location.",5,2018,06,29
202,Stayed overnight only,"We arrived late and left early to catch a flight. We were using spg points.

The room was a  nice size. The d√©cor luxury. The bed very comfortable. The bathroom was clean and roomy. 

The location was great for being near city attractions. I's about 25 minutes from the airport.",4,2018,06,27
202,"Luxury, 5-star service, ideal location","This stately hotel, a converted bank building, is ideally situated within walking distance of many of Dublin's most popular destinations, from Temple Bar to Dublin Castle to Trinity College, among others.  The hotel is luxe, with graciously sized rooms, and a staff that is eager, alert and unfailingly helpful.   From the concierge (Daragh is amazing) to the room manager (Doiran) to the doormen (first-rate walking directions) to the housekeeping staff, the entire crew aims to please.",5,2018,06,27
202,Gorgeous hotel,"Gorgeous Westin near so many attractions in Dublin. Very helpful & accommodating staff, spacious room & tons of amenities. I‚Äôd stay again! 
Contemporary bar in the basement & ATM outside of hotel. Tons of restaurants & shops within walking distance as well as the light rail.",4,2018,06,23
202,Welcoming to non-residents,"This review must be qualified by the fact that I did not and have not ever stayed in this hotel. Last week, fairly early in the morning, I was attending to personal business in central Dublin and I had about two hours to spare. I called into the Westin and was clear about wanting somewhere to sit and have a cup of coffee, orange juice etc for a good stretch.

Staff were very friendly and I was given delicious coffee and freshly squeezed, cold orange juice in the restaurant during breakfast. From what I see non-residents who want to avail of breakfast are made most welcome. I was told that there was no rush for me to leave and got excellent service. Good value also.

Toilets are very clean, also.",5,2018,06,22
202,Expected more from a Westin,"The check in was complicated and lengthy for reasons never explained to me, and my room was quite small, as were those of my companions traveling with me. It was also THE WORST LIT hotel room I have ever been in in over 40 years of business travel. Also, there was no fan in the bathroom. The hallways were rather dingy and the carpeting needs to be replaced. The whole place seemed a bit down-in-the-mouth....it needs some TLC and reinvestment. on the plus side was the concierge desk, where we were reliably given excellent advice on numerous occasions while we stayed there. Als, the breakfast buffet, included in our rate, was quite good as well. All in all, not one of the better westins, and rather disappointing.",3,2018,06,19
202,Above and way beyond our expectations!,"My husband and I had a dreamy stay at the Westin, Dublin! 

The staff really anticipated our needs from the check-in till we leave! The level of service was probably the among the highest that we have ever experienced. 

We arrived very early and wanted to drop off our luggage and see if there was a possibility for early check-in, as expected there was no room available yet, instead of sending us on our way, the nice lady at the front desk whisked us into the dining room for breakfast and told us that the first available room will be for us. The breakfast was simply sumptuous! Amoung standard varieties at a hotel buffet breakfast, we enjoyed Irish bacon, black and white pudding, bangers and delicious hash! It was one the best and most extensive breakfasts we have had at a hotel period! 

After breakfast we took a short stroll, when we went back the room was ready! It was a romantic suite with balcony which over looks the Trinity college! What a view to behold! And the weather turned out to be so sunny and warm and my husband and I just could not bring ourselves to leave the spacious deck drenched in sunlight........... we lazed away an entire morning and had a delicious a la cart breakfast on the balcony the next morning! 

The bathroom was roomy and tastefully done, even though the building is historic there was no problem with slow drainage or moldy smell like some of the older hotels have, in fact the bathroom was spotless! And believe me, I am really picky and I don‚Äôt use that word easily........... but the house cleaning staff were as amazing as the rest! Seriously impressed! 

Unless we do not return to Dublin, which we will most definitely visit as often as we can, we will hence forth only stay at the Westin! Irish culture is an amazingly warm, hospitable, caring one, we have never had any negative experience in Ireland, yet, the Westin Dublin managed to impress and thrill us still, well done and please keep up the good work! 

Many thanks to the staffs at the hotel and the management team for a seamlessly perfect experience!",5,2018,06,18
202,Lovely Experience,"My bestie and I stayed here during our vacation to Dublin. The location is absolutely perfect. And even though it rained HEAVILY everyday of our stay, we were still able to get out and see everything that we wanted to because of the proximity. The front desk staff were very nice and we especially loved the bar downstairs.",5,2018,06,18
202,Loud music kept me awake until 4 AM,"The hotel was lovely by day.  Close to Trinity College and the Temple Bar area.  The bed, pillows and linens were all great and comfortable but we were either next to a night club or the hotel itself had an event going on and the music was soooo loud and went on until 4 AM.  I would have asked to have been moved except that would have upset my husband.  Shame to spend all of that money and not be able to sleep!",2,2018,06,18
202,Great location ,"You can‚Äôt beat the location 
Close to shopping, transportation, temple bar etc 
The hotel is well maintained and has a fun bar down stairs. The staff really tries hard to make the stay comfortable. Effective, customer centric mgmt is very visible and translates well with the guest. Well done",5,2018,06,16
202,Great hotel in the center of Dublin,I recently stayed at the Westin in Dublin for business.  I am a platinum SPG customer and got a very nice upgrade to a large suite.  The rooms are classic and traditional though well appointed.  The bathroom was quite large and relatively modern.  The bed was a fantastic Westin quality bed.  I would definitely stay here again. ,4,2018,06,15
202,Great Property - Super Service,"First time stayed here.  Great service, both on check in and check out.  Room was clean and spacious.  Clever little power device above the Desk with USB, HDMI etc that was great for working at.  only niggle is the desk chair didnt move too well - but otherwise great.  Huge TV in the bedroom.  Breakfast in the AM was plentiful with a great selection.    Would recommend.",5,2018,06,13
202,"Not a 5 star hotel. No pool, tiny rooms, not family friendly.","I wrote this review on the Westin website and it was never published. I have emailed back and forth with the manager and I have not received any apology or compensation for my inconvenience. 

I stayed at a Westin hotel for the first time in Dublin May 26-28, 2018. This was supposed to be a 5 star luxury hotel, but was very disappointed with the stay. We arrived at 5pm after a long 16 hour red eye flight from Atlanta. I told them that I was guaranteed 2 double beds and a quiet room as we wanted to sleep. We were told that there were no double beds, but they had a king bed so we said that should be fine. We dragged our luggage to our room as there was no porter and the room was very small and had a tiny double bed, no bathtub and no window just a skylight. 

We went back downstairs and was told that the hotel was booked and there were no other rooms available. I spoke to another person, then the manager and he confirmed this and said he would try to find another room. We also requested an extra bed as all 3 of us could not fit on the small double bed and he said there were none available and to check back with him. He said maybe the next day he might have something available but wasn't sure. 

We ate dinner at the Moreland's restaurant and they got my son's dinner order wrong and did nothing to compensate us. We went back to the front desk and they said they still had nothing available. Again we were offered no apology or compensation. We were exhausted at this point and just wanted to sleep so requested extra bedding for my husband to sleep on the narrow area on the floor in front of the bed. It took awhile to receive this and was just given a duvet, a pillow and sheet. I asked if they had an extra mattress pad or anything and was told no. My 6 year old son and I slept on the small double bed and barely had any room to move around or any place for our suitcases. 

So my husband slept on the hard floor and we had difficulty sleeping because the skylight let in too much light, there was a musty smell and there was noise from the street. The next morning we had a tour planned so had to leave early. 

That afternoon we returned and I spoke to another manager who said she had no record of what happened and I had to explain the whole situation again. She said there was nothing available. I told her I looked online and it states that there is a king room available and she said it was not. She then said she could move us down the hall to another room with a double bed and can bring a portable mattress as it would not fit in the room we were staying in. 

I asked to check the room and they showed me the new room which was slightly larger with a window and a tub, so I said that was fine and she said a porter would come up and help us move our luggage. We waited 30 minutes and nobody showed up. I called and was told that the porter was moving some cars and was not available, so we just moved the luggage ourselves. 

We checked out the next morning and the same manager was there. She again offered no apology for our inconvenience. 

Needless to say we were very disappointed in our stay and do not think the level of this hotel is anything close to 5 stars. We have stayed at many Ritz Carltons, Marriotts and Four seasons so were expecting something close to that level.",1,2018,06,13
202,Gorgeous Property,"This stunning, unique property with an excellent central location is a true Westin Experience. Beautiful decor, well appointed, and consistencies of a Westin make this an excellent choice.

I tend to be sensitive to sound and had not issues with internal or external noise pollution which made for a great, comfortable sleep.  

Upon presenting at check-in, along with my same-sex spouse, staff suggested we would want to make a change to our room from our booked choice of a King selection to a two bed configuration.  Miscommunication or not this was an unfortunate greeting to the property for us. 

Buffet breakfast was not as expected - brands standard fare, the 8.00 offering at Kilkenny Shop had more delicious offerings and quality.",4,2018,06,10
202,Very nice hotel in a great location.,"A group of friends spent several days at the Westin and were pleased with the hotel. However, the beds were not soft and the pillows were hard. Also, there appears there is no air conditioning as the rooms were hot.  I did not care for the Irish breakfast, no muffins or bagels.",4,2018,06,10
202,"Yes, absolutely!","The Westin in Dublin is historic, grand, beautiful, and provides great service.  The rooms aren't huge but they are comfortable and everything it top tier.  The staff is very professional and friendly and are willing to answer questions about where to go, what to see, and pointing out some great restaurants known by the locals and off the beaten tourist path.",5,2018,06,08
202,Wonderful Hotel,This Westin was excellent! Location. Was perfect! The rooms were great and the staff was friendly and helpful! Out of the various hotels we stayed in on this trip. The Westin in Dublin was our favorite. ,5,2018,06,06
202,Excellent Location for Touring Dublin,"My husband and I stayed at the Westin Dublin for 5 nights while we toured the city and surrounding area. The hotel is located centrally for all the sites of Dublin and is within easy walking distance to Trinity College, City Hall and other tourist destinations in the city. After a quick and easy check in we stayed in a room with a king size bed which was spotless, modern and quiet. It was a bit more spacious as it was an accessible room so the bathroom was larger than usual. The room was cleaned daily and kept up well. There were plenty of towels and amenties in the bathroom, large closets, a safe and robes and slippers provided. The daily breakfast, buffet style, was included in the cost of the room. The buffet served pastries, toast/bagels, eggs, sausage/bacon, hashbrowns, juice, coffee/tea, etc. so a lot of different options to choose from. The concierge was very helpful with restaurant suggestions. We had lunch and drinks at The Atrium Lounge and received good service and the food was also very good. The only improvement would be with the Morelands Grill restaurant, there were only 3 tables occupied and the service was poor and very slow. The food was excellent, well presented and prepared, however I feel the staff were missing in action and we had to get the server from another section to serve us during the evening. I would stay at this hotel again and recommend it to friends and family.",5,2018,06,06
202,Wonderful hotel and well located,"My stay at this hotel was wonderful.  it was modern, clean and quiet.  Comfortable bed.  Staff was very friendly.  I did get lost coming back to the hotel one time, but I think it was because I was jet lagged.",5,2018,06,01
202,Westin Dublin,"Great central location-next to Trinity! Very courteous service and excellent food! Room was spacious, available for early check in. Concierge(s) all very helpful and well informed! Highly recommend a trip to Cliffs of Moher! Absolutely stunning! Countryside is beautiful!",5,2018,06,01
202,Lovely few days - a quiet oasis,"Our tour group stayed at the Trinity City Hotel down the street.  We extended our trip by a few days and moved to the Westin (yea SGP points!).  The mezzanine bar was an oasis from the bustling city.   Our room was comfortable and roomy.  We find Westins reliably comfortable, with friendly staff.  ",5,2018,05,29
202,SPG loyalist not impressed ,"Since I stayed on points, I am ok with this stay as the location was super convenient for experiencing Dublin. If I had paid the $400ish nightly rate for 6 nights, I would not be as happy for sure!!

I had mentioned our 30th anniversary was in the first day of our stay. I have had European locations deliver wine, chocolates, etc. for no reason at all. Here? Nothing. No upgrades room, no card, some fresh fruit? Just disappointed that SPG did not show the love. Generally, I never expect special treatment but given the inflated points redemption, a 6 night stay, a European location, my lifetime platinum status and advance notification of a significant life event...It was actually surprising that an SPG property did nothing out of the ordinary to value a loyal customer.

Be aware this property is very close to Temple Bar. We heard loud behavior from the street into the early morning and we were on the 4th floor! Also, this proximity brings guests that are loud in the hallways from late night partying. I did not expect that.

The concierge, Kenneth, was one of the nicest and most helpful people we met during our stay. That is a big compliment given the Irish people we had the pleasure to meet were some of the greatest we have ever met in our travels. Will definitely return to Ireland but will skip the Westin.

",3,2018,05,29
202,Beautiful...,We stayed here for 1 night and it was amazing. the service at this hotel is fantastic and the breakfast was the best we had at any hotel in Ireland. The rooms are a bit small which is to be expected but very nice and clean. Overall it was lovely.,5,2018,05,27
202,"Luxury, Location and Outstanding Service","We stayed 2 nights at this Hotel. the rooms are well appointed, comfortable and clean. The location was amazing and is within walking distance of many points of interest.
The staff is wonderful!  We happened to be there on my 55th Birthday and my Husband mentioned it in passing to Lisa at the Check-in desk when we arrived. The next day, My Birthday, a plate of cakes and tarts with a chocolate Happy Birthday placard was placed in our room. Excellent Customer Service!
And the Baqpiper at the entrance was such a nice touch.
I travel the world for a living and have stayed in many different hotels.
I will always stay at the Westin whenever I am in Dublin!",5,2018,05,27
202,Luxury and location,"Used cash and points for our 2 night/2 day stay and were very happy we chose the Westin as our home base.  Had a fun first day (not in order) walking to Guinness Storehouse, St. Pat's and Christ church, Dublin castle, Trinity/book of Kells, famine sculptures, Ha'Penny bridge, Grafton St., St. Stephen's Green and Temple bar.  Second day was spent on a bus tour of Antrim coast.  Easy 10 min. walk to Molly Malone tour bus pick-up.  We upgraded to a King bed, city view that was available upon our early 10 am check-in.  Enjoyed  the drinks and apps served at the Mint Bar.  Nice comfy Westin beds, white tea toiletries, nesspresso machine, lavender essential oil by the bed, good concierge ready with maps and tips, roaring fireplace, fresh flowers, candlelit entry, doorman, etc.  We were glad we only spent 2 nights in Dublin and chose instead to spend time in Doolin, Dingle, Killarney, and Powerscourt.",5,2018,05,27
202,Worth It,"We stayed here for three nights during a very quick stay in Dublin. The location was great and walking distance to many points of interest especially The Academy venue where my husband was playing one of those nights. Most of all, the staff was kind and patient with our children (a preschooler and baby). The room was clean and comfy. And the bathroom was very spacious! This review is a little late, but I want to give special credit to the doorman (Alan?) and the concierge (Kenneth?), who were both especially helpful. Kenneth secured us a last minute car rental for the day that could accommodate our total family of 6 passengers. I would say overall the Westin was worth the price.",5,2018,05,26
202,Luxurious hotel in the heart of Dublin,"My wife and I spent 5 nights in a Deluxe King room at the Westin Dublin in May 2018.   The rooms are well appointed and very clean.   We had breakfast included with our stay in the Morelands Grill restaurant.  The breakfast service at Morelands was fantastic but the dinner service wasn't very good.  We only had dinner once at the Morelands grill because the service was slow, our waiter would vanish for long stretches and at one point another waiter took pity on us and served while our original waiter stood around chatting.   We visited the Atrium bar after our days touring Dublin and enjoyed it immensely.  The service at the Atrium was excellent and it was a nice quiet retreat after a long day of walking around Dublin.   The Westin is in a perfect location to walk to many of Dublins main attractions.  It is at a crossroads in central Dublin and we found it very easy to walk to Grafton Street, O'Connel Street, HaPenny Bridge, Dublin castle etc etc.   If you plan on visiting Dublin for a few days and want to be in the 'heart' of the action, then the Westin Dublin is the place to stay (skip the Morelands Grill for dinner though).",5,2018,05,26
202,Westin Dublin ,"Lovely place and strategically located in heart of London. Everything near by. Pleasant staff. Lovely rooms.
Only minus point I noticed was that if you order room service they charge delivery charges, yes you read it correct. Delivery charges for serving in room. I did spoke with them and this was the reply - @kumarvidhani This is normal for most of our hotels. This should be outlined on the room service menu in your room.  I was really disappointed by this. Also since hotel is under renovation rooms I got were blanked out by plastic sheet, so could not see out. Also we were occupying 7 rooms and most of us were couples and they allowed us twin bed rooms. So maybe next time I might avoid this hotel. ",5,2018,05,24
202,Wonderful stay,"I recently spent four nights at this fabulous hotel . The service was impeccable and the location ideal . The rooms were very clean and spacious and the concierge was extremely helpful in making sure our trip was enjoyable. I left one of my favorite pair of jeans in the room when I left and they graciously found them and mailed them back to me in the USA . I am so grateful!

202,You are Their Guest,"We checked into the Westin at the end of our trip to Ireland and we could not have chosen a better hotel. It was centrally located in a very nice section of the city, close to many sights, restaurants and of course pubs. The staff was quite helpful and they made sure your every need was met. We did take advantage of the afternoon tea and I would recommend everyone visiting this hotel to plan at least one tea at this hotel. The hotel is also known for their Saturday afternoon Gin and Jazz. They offer gin tonics with ingredients that I have never experienced here in the US. add this activity to your to do list when at the Westin. The rooms are spacious,  clean and comfortable. The restaurant has a very good breakfast buffet or menu choices. I would recommend this hotel to people who are looking for that extra special treatment when on a vacation. The staff treats you as though you are their own guests and they want you to enjoy your stay.",5,2018,05,21
202,Rosa & Damian are exceptional people!!,"Hi, 

I called into your fine hotel yesterday and I had the genuine pleasure of meeting Rosa and Damian. Both of these two wonderful people went above and beyond for a picky customer. 

Please pass on my regards and thanks. 

Food was exceptional and the drinks were great. 

Kind regards, 

Darragh",5,2018,05,20
202,Worst value for money hotel stay in years ,"3* service wrapped up in a 5* packet and sold at 7* prices. Last weekend was my 6th visit to this hotel since 2012 and will hopefully be my last. 

The nearest comparable rate I‚Äôve paid in the past 12 months, and therefore the best comparison point I have, is the Mandarin Oriental in Tokyo.  Albeit the MO was significantly cheaper.  It‚Äôs like comparing an AMO Zil to an Aston Martin DB5.

I booked two club rooms five months ago. In every club room I have stayed at every other SPG property there have been explicit benefits to justify the price tag such as a designated club floor or a club lounge. The club rooms at this hotel provide no incremental benefits. If they do I did not receive any.

The ‚ÄúQueen Bed Club‚Äù was designated ‚ÄúQuiet Location‚Äù. I ended up on the first floor over the main entrance opposite Temple Bar. The second room allocated was a standard atrium room on the first floor. After an unnecessarily difficult phone call at 10.30pm, and after refusing another noisy room with two single beds, a 4th floor room with a king bed in a quiet location was miraculously found. 

The check in was a shambles. Whilst waiting for the rooms I took my pre-booked afternoon tea on a table in a corridor that was too small to fit two afternoon teas on it. We asked to move tables but never received an answer. The banana bread, which last year was great, tasted like a block of cinnamon. Finally at about 2.40pm we were texted that one room was ready. I was never notified when the second became available; it was some time between 2.40pm and 5pm. 

Each morning we were quizzed if breakfast was included. I elected breakfast as a platinum benefit. Breakfast was mediocrity itself. The best interaction I had all weekend was with the concierge who was able to book a taxi with no drama. Every other interaction was at best ‚Äúok‚Äù. 

On the second morning I took breakfast before leaving.  I picked up my plate to find a post-it note on it saying ‚Äúpolished‚Äù.  That for me sums up the whole hotel. Yes it works, but is that the service you expect for ‚Ç¨395 per room per night?  I‚Äôd be happy at ‚Ç¨150.",1,2018,05,19
202,"Bizarre architecture lacking in amenities with rude non-english speaking staff, insanely expensive","Wow, what a difference a continent makes.  Absolutely no comparison to Japanese hotels.  We arrived tired after a 14 hour flight to find no one at the front entrance of the hotel to help with bags.   To make matters worse, the city of Dublin put a light rail tram line directly in front of the hotel, so you get unceremoniously dumped in an alley next to the property.  So if it rains, and this is Ireland we are talking about, prepare for a nice soaking.  We had to enter through the accessible doorway because they have steps and a ridiculous rotating door that doesn't handle carrying luggage well.  The side door nearly knocked my wife over.  It didn't get better when we got to the desk, there was no one there and it was only 7pm.  Finally, an eastern european young lady came out who had poor command of the english language.  She didn't put us in ""the best"" room in the suite category we had booked as required by SPG platinum status.  She informed us there was no lounge so she was going to use my Platinum amenity to provide the breakfast that should be included both with room type, booking, and the fact they don't have a lounge (due to historical constraints, ya right).  They put us in a closet type room that costs 600 dollars a night, which they called ""Junior Suite.""  The plumbing was leaky, the TV didn't work and the shower was an after thought.  When asked about the upgrade or movement to another room, we were lied to and told, ""We only have 4 junior suites in the hotel.""  As in TOTAL out of 172 rooms.   The workout room is an afterthought which you have to get to through a little maze.  There are no windows and the room wasn't stocked properly with towels and the equipment was poor and the place a mess, simply awful.  They rate themselves ""5 STARS""  however last time I checked 5 Stars was based on amenities like  a pool, a spa, a proper gym, and a lounge.  This place is a classic bait and switch.  I tried to resolve this with management before we left to absolutely no avail, in particular a rude czech manager by the name of Daniel.  I literally found ZERO Irish or English people working at this hotel what a total disappointment.  

I expect Mr. Kavinaugh to come on here stating he is ""shocked"" or otherwise ""sharing"" feedback with his departments, but that is also a farce, since I sent him an email 3 days ago without a response.  

Oh and if you make a ""green choice"" and decline housekeeping they are all to happy to save a buck on their end, but the won't give you the points.  I can't say enough how awful this property is.",1,2018,05,15
202,Great Location,"You can't beat the Westin for location and service.  I have stayed at this hotel a number of times during my trips to Ireland and have to say it is excellent in every way.  We had a suite with separate living room.  Lots of space, and very quiet.",5,2018,05,12
202,"Good location, but needs improvements","Had an ""ok"" stay at the Westin for 2 nights prior to a cruise. They were professional when checking in and the bell hops were top-notch. Great location. 

From the front, you think this will be a modern hotel. Well... 

We were given a room that was ""quiet"" as the person checking us in described. There was a noise from the HVAC that sounded like a squirrel trying to get out. Even with the unit off!!! It was so loud, it kept me and my partner up until we resorted to sleeping pills. While intermittent, it carried on for hours. The engineer could not fix it, so we had to move rooms. (No help with a bell hop or cart. And not quick to deliver the new keys!) The second room was tiny, had an interior window that didn't open, hot as all he**, and the plugs at the desk did not work. 

For the super expensive price, the stay should have been much better. When we returned from the cruise, we chose another hotel. I'd suggest others consider the same.",3,2018,05,11
202,Perfect location,Located 100m from Trinity college and 100m to Temple bar it is a good start. This SPG hotel is a mixed of few business people and many high-end American tourists which elect to stay here from years. Good service. Lovely Atrium on level 2.,4,2018,05,08
202,Great SPG Hotel,"Very friendly people, good food and nice standard Westin rooms. Centrally located with buses, trams and easy access to restaurants and attractions.

The brunches are good with a huge variety of hot and cold food selections.
",5,2018,05,07
202,Not worth it. Avoid,"Stayed in this hotel on 13 February last and only getting around to writing review now. First id like to say its in a great location but thats all the positives. 
The most unfriendly un welcoming staff I have ever met. Booked this place over the phone and was told if I paid up in full I could avail of discount which I did.
The minute I arrived at the hotel I was hit with a ‚Ç¨60parking bill which was never mentioned while booking.
I brought this to the attention of an extremly rude supervisor/manager who basically told me its not his problem. 
I should have asked for my money there and then and left but I didn't as I had booked this especially for my wife's birthday and did not want to make a scene. We decided to go for an evening meal in the  restaurant down stairs and to be honest the food is over priced and not that great. The customer sitting beside me sent his meal back three times and then told the waitress to forget it. 
got u the next morning and went for a bit of shopping and when we returned discovered our room was left un cleaned. Instead of apologising they tried to say we left the do not disturb sign on the door which was not the case.we were told they would clean the room then while  went for a drink in the bar. When I booked I upgraded to a city view but instead I was looking at a chimney pot. 
I would like to say that I don't want anything from this hotel as I would never stay there again.",1,2018,05,03
202,Absolutely Wonderful Hotel and Staff,"This was my first time at the Westin Dublin but I hope that it will not be my last.  This is an absolutely beautiful hotel with a wonderful staff that are friendly, polite and professional.  We arrived at 11:00 am after a 15 night cruise from Miami to Dublin.  Knowing that the check in time was 3:00 pm we asked if we could possibly get an early check in and the great staff at reception did all that they could to get us to our room as soon as possible.  While waiting for our room to be cleaned we enjoyed lunch at the hotel restaurant.  The food and the service were excellent.  Shortly after being served a young man from the registration staff located us in the restaurant to advise us that our room was ready.  About a minute later I received a telephone call that my room was ready.  Our room was large, well maintained and very CLEAN.  The beds and the pillows were so comfortable that my wife told me that about 2 minutes after lying down I was sound asleep.  I have to give a special shout out to the door man who was so helpful in assisting us with our many suitcases and obtaining a taxi for us and to the registration staff for being so friendly and professional.  This is a wonderful hotel.  The hotel is located in a great location right next to Trinity College and only 2 blocks from the great restaurants at Temblebar.  Not only will I stay here again on my next visit to Dublin but I will highly recommend it to my family and friends.  This was a great start to a wonderful vacation in Ireland.",5,2018,05,02
202,Excellent Entertainment,"I was staying in Dublin for one night to visit a friend. We decided to meet at the hotel for a coffee, as my friend is using a wheelchair at the moment. We enjoyed coffee in Morelands which enabled us to relax and watch the world go around outside. There was a pianist and a jazz singer that were so good, we stayed for lunch!

I must say the hotel catered very well for my friend and it is certainly wheelchair friendly. We enjoyed a very relaxing lunch with excellent food.

After a very pleasant day, I came back for a drink in The Mint Bar. I was entertained once more by a band comprising of a female singer, female keyboard/sax player and some gents playing drums, bass and guitar. They put on an excellent show that I would have paid to see. My stay at the Westin was excellent, but the added entertainment was a real bonus.",5,2018,05,01
202,Wonderful Westin Dublin,"I stayed in the hotel recently for a company meeting. It is a charming hotel with its classical facade coupled nice ambiance in the lobby, restaurant and common areas. Hotel location is as stated, very centrally located and convenient.
The room I stayed is spacious, nicely decorated, clean and very well maintained. One thing to mentioned is the bed, it is extremely comfortable and serves me well for sweet dreams. Gives a welcoming and cosy feel.
Staffs are very helpful, friendly and sincere in their services. They provided me with very good advice to facilitate a fruitful exploratory walk around the city.
I would definitely choose to stay here if I were to visit Dublin again. 
Cheers!",5,2018,04,26
202,Exactly as advertised,"What continues to amaze me about Trip Advisor is that the you read the reviews, they more they say the same things.  I mean that the general consensus is usually accurate.  So it is with the Westin Dublin.

The location is as advertised.  Right where you want to be.Easy walking distance to everywhere except the Dublin Jail, Modern Art Museum and sadly, the Guinness Brewery. 

The hotel staff is fine but not stellar.  A number of non-native  English Speakers.  when I would call down at night, sometimes the on duty staff would have a hard time understanding what I was saying.  That did get a little frustrating.  The Concierge staff was outstanding.  Great guys.  Extremely helpful and knowledgeable.  They could take car of everything.  They listen and talk as long as you want.  Bellman were great too.  On the day we left,  the Bellman ran across the street with our luggage so we could make the departure time.  Those little things make a difference.

The rooms were fine.  We stayed on points. We got a room the night before we arrived so we had one ready when we showed up at 10 a.m.  No upgrade even though I have SPG status.  They hotel is 100 full all the time.  They have some many groups, weddings, business meetings.  Business is booming.  Book early.  The beds are fine and the room we had had an outside view and it was very quiet.  I liked the USBs in the room.  No need to bring electric converters.

Workout facility - Sparse.  The mirrors and plants only try to hide the limited space they devoted to the facility.  While you make more money using the space for rooms, this is the one things in the hotel that needs an upgrade.  It is bare bones, but certainly adequate.  However, not good enough for a hotel of this size.

a few other things.

When arriving form the airport, take the AIRCOACH, not he AIRTRAIN (Bus 747 or 757).  The AIRTRAIN (Which is a bus) is one Euro less but it takes twice a long, a  longer walk to the hotel and is not nearly as comfortable.

There is no UBER in Dublin.  They are illegal.  The taxis have apps similar to UBER, but it all is in the taxi context.

This is a fine hotel, well worth a visit.  Close to everything you want to do.  First rate.  It is very expensive.  A nice room will easily cost you in the $600 range.  You pay for what this hotel has to offer.",4,2018,04,23
202,Brief stay for the rugby,"Absolutly fantastic stay in the Westin on 21st April. We were in town for the game between Scarlets and Leinster, arrived in the city at 7 and headed to the hotel at 9ish hoping to drop our bags off and check in after the game. The receptionist couldn't have been more helpful, she managed to check us in early giving us some much needed rest before heading out. Rooms were great, the doorman was extremely helpful giving some great reccomendations and advice. A fantastic stay in a true 5 star hotel with excellent staff. Would certainly stay again.",5,2018,04,23
202,Upgraded Room=Great Stay,"I got upgraded to a top floor suite with AMEX card and my room was lovely! It was very spacious, had a huge bathroom and massive balcony overlooking Trinity College and Temple Bar! It did not disappoint! I loved the Vault Bar below and it was an excellent location from which to travel around Dublin. 

My colleague however did not get an upgrade and his room was pretty small and inconveniently laid out. 

The morning breakfast was great and the service/concierge very helpful. I would definitely stay there again and recommend it to anyone looking for a nice place to stay! The hotel had a great smell too!

One thing they did wrong at the end of my trip which majorly annoyed me is calling me Mrs. [insert name of my male colleague here] and putting the tab under his name even though I made all reservations, we had separate rooms and I paid for it with my credit card. Please train your employees to not just assume a woman is just some man's husband along for a business trip!",5,2018,04,23
202,Great location and clean comfy rooms,"The location can‚Äôt be beat; steps away from all of the touristy pubs, the River Liffey, and near to some of the major department stores.
We stayed here for the first and last nights of our seven day trip, and were lucky enough to get a suite on the first night and a room with a view for our last night. Rooms are clean and beds very comfortable.
Staff was very helpful and courteous.
Our breakfasts were included both mornings and the buffet was very good.
I would highly recommend this hotel.",4,2018,04,20
202,"Multiple Stays, Both were Excellent","My fiance and I stayed at The Westin twice in one week; the stays bookended a tour we took of Ireland. When we checked in at the beginning of our stay in Ireland the hotel staff, at the request of my fiance, placed rose petals on our bed to set a romantic tone and I must say I was impressed! Both rooms were very spacious and quiet and the staff were friendly and accommodating. The breakfast was plentiful and yummy and everything a Westin should be. The hotel is within walking distance to many Dublin attractions including Trinity College, St. Patrick's Cathedral and Temple Bar. We highly recommend this hotel when staying in Dublin!",5,2018,04,18
202,"Great location, good room and friendly service","We stayed at the Westin in Dublin for only 1 night.  This was our second time to stay at the hotel.  We had stayed 6 years ago and enjoyed it back then also.
Location - very good for exploring city center on foot.
Check in - friendly and professional.  Our room was not ready, so we went to lunch.  The woman who checked us in brought the room card keys to us during our lunch in the restaurant.  Nice touch.
Lobby and Hotel common areas - very nice.  When we were taking the elevator, we could see a lot of people enjoying afternoon tea in the Atrium area.
Room - We were told that we were upgraded.  However, the room with two beds were normal size (each bed is what I would call a double) by U.S. standards.  Beds were comfortable.  Bathroom is nice and large.  Only problem was with the toilet that did not flush well.  If we were staying longer, I would have told them about it.  Shower is separate from bath which I like.  Lots of electrical plugs to charge our devices.
Restaurant - We had lunch at Morelands.  Food and service were good, but it is expensive.  You can find many restaurants that are just as good outside of the hotel within walking distance.  The Bloody Mary's were not good.  Tasted like tomato juice and water and no spice.  We switched to beer.  Marinated chicken sandwich and fish and chips were very tasty.  We also had breakfast in the restaurant.  It is a buffet and is very good.  It was included with our room; however I would not have paid if it had not been included.  There are plenty of other good options to get a quick breakfast just outside the hotel.
Check out - No problems.  The hotel quickly got us a car to the airport for 30 euros.
Overall, I would recommend this hotel.  It is somewhat expensive, but may be worth it for just a night or two.  We will stay here again when we return to Dublin.",4,2018,04,18
202,An Excellent Stay,"Though our stay in the hotel was brief, the hotel more than met our expectations. We enjoyed afternoon tea in the lounge, followed every suggestion from the kind Bellman at the front door to the concierge and front desk staff. The location is ideal for an evening in Temple Bar, or a visit to the Book of Kells. The hotel is ideally suited to fun shops and restaurants. We went with locals to the restaurant on the second floor of Kilkenny's which has something for everyone. Our room was lovely -- clean, well appointed, and had a luxurious bathroom. A request for an extra duvet was met within moments, and the staff was extremely friendly and accommodating. We are huge fans of the Starwood hotels and would highly recommend the Dublin Westin for fellow travelers who want something special.",5,2018,04,17
202,Very nice,"We had a lovely overnight stay at the Westin hotel,it has a nice ambience  about it although  its big it is also cosy,the mint bar is great and the staff are friendly,the atrium is like an indoor courtyard and so relaxing and quiet.our room was lovely it was very roomy  and the bed and pillows are so so comfy.we didn't  eat there this time so can't  comment.it is also very central.i would love to stay in this hotel again and would recommend.",4,2018,04,16
202,"Standard Westin, nice breakfast ","To preface: I‚Äôm an SPG platinum member so I am used to very good service at Starwood properties. 

I‚Äôve stayed at this Westin twice now: once was upgraded to a suite, and then this time. It was a very busy time in Dublin and many hotels were quite booked so I didn‚Äôt receive an upgrade (that‚Äôs fine). 

The rooms are cozy, the bathrooms are fairly large for Europe even though a bit outdated compared to many Westin properties. The gym is nothing special. 

The basement bar, the Mint, has great cocktails. I especially like the smoked old fashioned. And the breakfast (i choose it as my platinum amenity so I don‚Äôt pay‚Äîto disclose) is quite good. 

The location is directly next to Temple Bar so it can be a bit noisy in the evenings but the location is great for restaurants. ",4,2018,04,14
202,Great Location & Beautiful Rooms,"We stayed here to start our vacation off in Ireland. We landed at 5 a.m. in Dublin, so I booked our rooms for the night before so our room was ready when we landed. I highly recommend doing this. It's a popular hotel and don't expect your room to be ready at 5 a.m. when check in is at 4 p.m. Just pay for the extra night. You will not regret this! 

Our adjoining rooms were ready and we unpacked, went and ate breakfast at the famous Bewley's on Grafton Street from 1884. Delicious. We ate breakfast and came back and slept for a few hours before touring the city. This Westin is in the middle of Dublin. Great location and you can walk everywhere from here. 

The rooms are so beautiful. The bathrooms are beautiful. Perfect hotel!",5,2018,04,12
202,Not worth the price,"Location, that is the only plus to this hotel as it is only 2 minutes away from Trinity College, Temple Bar and Grafton Street shopping area. For the hotel itself, only the price is 5 star, the rooms are worn out and you do not feel really welcome here. A pity.",2,2018,04,11
202,Great Breakfast,"The hotel is so pretty and welcoming. We had a huge room with a large bathroom for two people. I had expected much smaller for a city centre hotel. 
We had afternoon tea in the atrium and breakfast was amazing with a great selection. 
The staff were very friendly especially the concierge Mo who gave great advice on where to eat nearby.",5,2018,04,11
202,Best Hotel Cocktail Bar in Dublin,"We stayed in a Writers Room on the top floor which had a door onto a roof terrace overlooking Trinity College. Room was perfect for us, not too large but just enough space, although the TV was in a weird position. 
The Mint Bar serves excellent cocktails, I was on my own for a while so grabbed a seat at the bar and was looked after really well by the superb bar staff. 
The hotel restaurant is Morelands and it's a really nice dining room with plenty of space and an interesting menu. 
A late checkout was included in our deal. 
I can't fault the hotel or staff, our stay was perfect. Definitely coming back.",5,2018,04,10
202,Excellent hotel and staff,"Very convenient location, great service and a fantastic breakfast (included in the price)!  We were only staying for one night and were given a room on the top floor, it was lovely and quiet - much appreciated.",5,2018,04,07
202,Amazing staff,"We were impressed the moment we arrived by the staff's proactive spirit and impeccable service. My family and I were tired from our 4-hour drive to Dublin and as we were driving by the hotel, we managed to catch the attention of the doorman and asked him where we could park. He gestured for us to go around the building. Little did we know that he will come running over to our car to help us with the luggages. The staff at the front desk who checked us in was equally attentive and accommodated our requests and resolved our complicated reservations for us. She wasn't just professional in in making sure she got the reservations and requests correct but she did it in a warm and welcoming way. The porter too was efficient and friendly who made sure he checked back in with us after he brought our bags up to the rooms. Overall, a wonderful stay where we also enjoyed the spacious bathroom and room, proximity to public transit, restaurants, etc.",5,2018,04,05
202,Comfortable,"I selected the Westin because it is very central, and I'm a Starwood member. I was able to walk to all of my business meetings, and to after-hours venues for dinner and drinks.
Room was very comfortable, and had a good view over Trinity College. Traffic was unbelievably thick but almost no noise in the room.
Fire alarm one night was a false alarm, and not many staff seemed to know what to do. Better training recommended there.",4,2018,04,03
202,Lovely city center hotel,"The Westin is a wonderful city center hotel, close to everything.   Twenty minute walk to Guinness Store House, 2 minute walk to Trinity College, right on the river.  We had two adjoining rooms.  Both were excellent.  One had a queen bed, and the other had two twin beds. 
About a 30 minute drive from the airport.    Valet parking only.  You pull up on the side street next to the hotel.  The staff is awesome.  Very professional and friendly.   Umbrellas were on loan should you forget to bring one.  Full of information.  Reception worked super hard to get the rooms we need quickly upon our arrival.  We arrived in Dublin at 9am, so we got to the hotel around 11am, and very tired.   
The rooms were good size, beds comfortable and bathrooms were a nice size also.  Both rooms had nice showers and tubs.  
We would definitely stay here again.  ",5,2018,03,31
202,The good and the bad,"The good: breakfast was fantastic.  I‚Äôm a Starwood person and it‚Äôs pretty typical to use the free breakfast amenity, which is usually a fairly lame buffet.  There is a buffet here too, and it‚Äôs ok, but they‚Äôll also make you stuff.  So we got poached eggs, fried eggs, pancakes, waffles, over the course of our stay and they were all cooked perfectly and devliered to us fast (we had tours to make and museums to see!),  Also, the hotel staff was superb - very helpful and always ultra courteous.  The hotel is in an awesome location with restaurants, the Temple Bar area, Trinity, and O‚ÄôConnell street literally steps away in either direction as you leave the hotel.  

The bad: weird smells in our room.  They‚Äôd come and go, but when they showed up...oh boy, smelled like something died in the air vent or something.  I‚Äôm guessing this was a localized problem so don‚Äôt take this to mean the entire hotel smelled - IT DIDN‚ÄôT... but this was our experience in our room.  Also, the toilets.  Had to flush them 3 times at least if there was the least amount of toilet paper in them.  Weird.  That part I‚Äôm guessing is more common to all rooms since it looked to be working as designed, the design just didn‚Äôt flush well.",4,2018,03,31
202,Dublin,"Location of hotel is great.  Close to many attractions and within walking distance to most day trip bus pickups.  We arrived at the hotel after 24 hours of travel.  Our room was not ready, even though I had requested early checkin.  They held our luggage so that we could go explore and get something to eat.  When we returned, our room was ready and everything was as expected.  We went to bed early to be awakened at 1:15 am by the fire alarm.  We dressed and exited the hotel from the 3rd floor out onto the street.  We proceeded to walk around the building to the front of the hotel.  During this time there was not one hotel employee directing people.  We stood out in front of the hotel trying to figure out what was going on.  Still no hotel employees!!  We went back into the hotel - there were no employees to stop us.  When we reached the check in counter, there were several employees coming out of the back with bright vests on.  This is a good 10-15 minutes after the alarm started.  We were told then that it was a false alarm and we could return to our rooms.  We walked the 3 flights back up as the elevator was not running yet.  I was unable to fall back to sleep for the rest of the night (probably due to time change) and to add insult to injury - the wifi did not work!!  I called down and was told because of the alarm it would have to be reset in the morning when IT came in.
All this made for a rough start to our vacation.  Without the needed hours of sleep, I was pretty worn out for the first few days.
They definitely should have a better emergency plan in place.  Had this been a true emergency, it could have been a huge issue.",3,2018,03,27
202,A satisfactory stay,"I stayed here for one night for business. The location of the hotel is smack bang in the centre of town and you are really in walking distance of everything.

The rooms are nice and the bathrooms are large and have bath tubs even in the entry level rooms.

My breakfast was included in my rate and it was nice, but nothing special. If you want an omelette then you had to pay extra which I thought was bad form for a five star hotel.

I had room service the night before and it was quick but I specifically asked for cracked black pepper and did not receive it and there was only a tiny bit of Parmesan on my pasta. In previous 5 star hotels I have stayed in you get a little pot of it to add to your requirements. The tray charge is ‚Ç¨7.50 which is higher than average and so I did not tip, which was a little awkward with the server.

My main issue was that the person who stayed in my room before me left the alarm clock programmed for 6.07am so I was awoken earlier than I wanted to get up! House keeping had failed to check this. Had I been staying at this hotel on vacation I would have been very annoyed. I did report this upon check out and they apologised and said they would look into it with house keeping, but that was it. 

I would stay here again, but mostly due to the location rather than having an amazing experience.

202,Will stay again!,We stayed here as we were attending a concert in the Olympia and it's proximity to it was the main reason for choosing the Westin.  I knew it was a 5 star but did not have any other expectations bar what a 5 star would normally offer.  It certainly fulfilled these expectations and more.  The service from start to finish was excellent.  All the staff were so helpful and friendly and couldn't do enough for you.  The bed was super comfortable and one of the major plusses was that you could not hear any noise from inside your room. The breakfast was one of the best I've had in an Irish hotel.  Overall would highly recommend if you are intending a visit to Dublin and definitely if you are going the Olympia as it is only a 7 minute walk away. ,5,2018,03,21
202,Snowy St.Patricks Weekend,"The Westin hotel in Dublin is centrally located to everything that you need. If it hadn‚Äôt been snowing and extremely cold we would‚Äôve been able to walk to everything you would want to see. The hotel offers five star service. The room we had looked into the atrium. We did not think we were going to like not having  a view to the outside, however it ended up being a really nice room because of how quiet it was and we didn‚Äôt have the street‚Äôs  outside noise. The staff was completely attentive to everyone even though it was the busiest weekend of the year. The food was really top notch. The Irish breakfast and dinners were superb. ",5,2018,03,21
202,Wonderful hotel!,"Loved the Westin Dublin. Perfect location. Walking distance to most everything. Rooms were impeccably clean and spacious. 
We had the in room breakfast one morning before we headed out of town for a tour and it was delivered right on time. Delicious  food in generous portions. 
Would definitely stay here again. ",5,2018,03,20
202,Great experience ,"Located in the centre of Dublin, ideally placed for a sightseeing tour of Dublin. 

Although on the main road and fronted by a tram line my room very almost silent 

The room was very nice, with a large bed, work desk, comfortable chair, TV. 

A very functional bathroom with a good shower and bath. 

The staff were universally helpful. 

",5,2018,03,17
202,Excellent Accommodations,"Hotel is so good that we extended our stay for 3 more nights.  Staff is very attentive and quick to help.  The rooms are nice and most importantly clean.  The pub area is very nice as well.  It is a bit pricey; but can‚Äôt argue with such a great central location to pretty much everything.

I still have2 more nights here, but if looking for a place to stay for St. Patrick‚Äôs Day, The Westin Dublin is great!",5,2018,03,13
202,"Great hotel, great location","I travel to Dublin frequently for business, and The Westin Dublin has won my loyalty over the other hotels in the area because of its consistency. Consistently good rooms that are considerably more spacious than some of the more historic hotels, consistently good service including the food... plus you really can't beat the location. Definitely recommend.",4,2018,03,12
202,Great stay,"The Westin is lovely... super comfortable beds, great service and grand location. All the staff were warm and friendly. We had booking complications due to the wintry weather and delays and all the staff were so patient and forbearing with sorting it all out. We would stay here again any time. Highly recommended. ",5,2018,03,08
202,Beautiful and Accommodating Hotel ,Beautiful hotel and AMAZING location.  You can walk everywhere.  Staff were very kind and helpful and the concierge had great tips.  Hotel was a bit pricy but that seems to be the location.  The Mint Bar at the hotel was lovely with amazing cocktails; again though very pricy.,5,2018,03,03
202,Good deal in the city centre,"Very good place in the heart of the city. Staff are courteous and service is prompt. Compared to most European hotels, the amenities are quite nice, including the gym. I gave it four stars instead of five because it lacks the pure luxury of a Belmond or Four Seasons. Good for business travelers and your typical visitor.",4,2018,03,02
202,"Comfortable, right in the heart of Dublin","An amazing hotel with the perfect location in the center of Dublin, a quick walk to Trinity College, Temple Bar, Grafton St, and many other places in the city.  Extremely clean hotel with great customer service. We took a red eye from Boston so it was very nice that there breakfast restaurant opens at 6:30am, and even though they were booked fully they had our room cleaned and ready for us to check in by 10am.  There Mint Bar was a nice place to grab drinks (see Mint Bar review. 
Our room, 300, right next to the elevator, was clean and spacious, there was plenty of storage for our clothes and the bed was very comfortable.  Bathroom was huge with a soaking tub and a shower.  A big bonus was that our room looked right over Trinity College.  Will definitely stay here next time we are in Dublin.",5,2018,03,01
202,Location is everything at Westin Dublin,"So glad we chose the Westin Dublin for our 3 night stay in Dublin! There really is not a better location for a hotel in the city, after exploring it for 3 days.  It is right across the street from the Temple Bar area, and Grafton street is a half block away for shopping.  It was always easy to catch a cab and there were plenty of pubs and restaurants close by.

As loyal Westin customers, I can say that this feels like many of the other Westin properties, with solid service, nice rooms, comfy beds, and spacious bathrooms.  This property met our expectations in all facets.

Pros: Location - we would never stay anywhere else upon another visit to Dublin; cleanliness; the size of our bathroom was very impressive, with a soaking tub and separate rainfall shower; our room was especially quiet, because we stayed in the inner part of the hotel facing the Atrium.  Our room actually had a desk as well, which made the room feel a little larger.  

Cons: We arrived at the Westin Dublin on a Thursday at 2PM.  Check in time was 3PM.  Our room was not ready upon arrival, and as we were eating/shopping close by, the phone call for our room came after 5PM.  Not a huge deal, but definitely a late check-in.",5,2018,02,27
202,Excellently situated classic hotel in Dublin 2,"I had two reasons for choosing the Westin really; a friend had drawn my attention to it on a previous visit to Dublin and the Westin in Ebisu is my standby in Tokyo.

The hotel is in a great location, more or less opposite the Bank of Ireland and a few minutes walk from Grafton St. There is one small drawback of that location - when arriving by taxi, there is nowhere out front for them to pull up, so you end up crossing the road with your luggage. When leaving, there is a taxi stand round the side of the hotel. 

The exterior is a classic city centre Dublin building (I don't remember the neon lighting of the entrance before, it's not really in keeping with the building itself). It used to be a bank and that is even more apparent inside, where it's somewhat mazelike. I quite liked that, zigzagging from the lifts to my room.

The welcome was warm and friendly, as in fact was every contact I had with the staff throughout my stay. 

City centre hotels in some European hotels can be small and that was definitely the case here. I don't really need more space, but I like to have it and the Westin was a little smaller than expected, given how much you can expect to pay for a quality hotel in Dublin. The bathroom was quite spacious though, with a full size bath (which is critical for me) and separate shower. The loo was a bit cramped against a wall, mind. The proprietary toiletries were quite nice.

My room overlooked a central atrium. I was a little concerned at first that there was a bar directly below but the room was well insulated and I had no problem with noise. The (queen) bed was comfortable, although again could have been bigger (longer in particular) and the open end of the bedding was at the top of the bed, which was an odd choice. I slept well enough though, the Heavenly Bed concept works well for me.

Breakfast was ok and in line with usual luxury hotel pricing, though some of the ingredients could stand to be a bit higher quality. Some really good artisanal breads woould be great, for instance. Could have used some more choice in the sliced cheese, though the Cheddar in black wax was delicious!

So a few niggles mean I can't give the five circles, but I enjoyed my stay and would come again.",4,2018,02,27
202,"Perfection in Central Dublin, lost a star due to rude staff","STARWOOD: PLATINUM
MARRIOTT: GOLD (No Longer using Marriott)
MELIA: SILVER

This 3 night stay occurred the first week of December, so it was a beautiful Christmas vibe in lovely Dublin.
I knew I had limited time to explore and experience the city, and that I would be arriving extremely tired after 20 hours of flying so I called the hotel weeks before the trip and again a few days prior, all to make sure that a room was ready when I arrived, around 1130AM.
Unfortunately, the staff couldn't have been less understanding, and frankly robotically snooty as well. I was not recognized for any loyalty, or offered anything to help ease a wait time for a room, simply, it wont be ready for ""awhile"".
Well, i'll go eat and grab a pint them, did that, came back, still not ready, now I am angry. I can hardly see straight and I don't want the evening ruined because I've not gotten any rest, I ask for a manager asap. I am again rudely handled and basically told to sit ""literally"" in the corner, there's 1 chair in a corner, there I was.
Thank goodness, the manager understood, this was a horrible look, and after a chat, which I had little energy for, a room appeared and it was the nice one I expected, although I didn't care at that point. Its unfortunate when a world class property fails because I have to type all this before I can even describe the property.

HOTEL: As you can see from the pictures below, this is truly a beautiful property, a gem in the starwood portfolio. It's location in Central Dublin is a beautiful walk from anything. St.Stephens Green, all the shopping, the infamous Cellar on the Green, plenty of Restaurants, Pubs, Lounges, everything you could need. I chose Uber both to and from the airport but there is an airport bus stop and its very frequent, even at 4am from directly across from the Hotel front door.
Not sure exactly how many floors but i'll recall perhaps 8-10 and its built with a courtyard center which all inward rooms look onto and a restaurant is.

THE LOCATION: As stated above, if Central Dublin is your goal, you cant do better. Anything you may have organized to leave from central Dublin to elsewhere is likely very easily assessable from the property as well.

THE ROOM(S): My room was not extremely large but as you can see from the pictures it was big enough and well appointed. A nice view of the Courtyard, up a few floors which is a major request of mine, and everything was clean, comfortable and well looked after.

THE STAFF: One star deducted for the 2 girls at the front desk. One additional staff member that works the front desk and is from Eastern Europe was excellent as was the Manager when I finally got him, and the Bell staff, always greeting with a smile.

I do hope the 2 with the attitude are re-trained or something, I pity anyone else who had to endure what I did at first.

Was my Elite recognized? Not at first, and I would say when it really mattered but eventually yes.

I would recommend this property without a doubt, there are bad staff all over, but that is not what makes a hotel, that only tarnishes it. This Hotel is a gem and should not be overlooked",4,2018,02,26
202,Guaranteed Satisfaction ,"Luxurious? Yes. Comfortable? That is something you can bet on. I was greeted with a smile at the reception and given all the help and introduction needed to make my stay just perfect. Location wise, it‚Äôs just awesome to be right next to Trinity College, and walking distance to most sights and attractions, right in the center. 

Rooms are beautifully decorated and the bed is comfortable, the bathroom is spacious though lighting is too bright.

Breakfast was very good, food is fresh and service is a five star. The afternoon tea area is warm and neat. 

Concierge is informative and very helpful with arranging any tours or restaurants, they recommended excellent places.

",5,2018,02,25
202,Morning coffee,"This is a must hotel to call to when visiting Dublin. Such a lovely place to meet friends or start your day in Dublin. The Atrium is so relaxing. A lovely welcome always awaits you. Tea & scones a great option & very generous portion of 3 scones & beautifully presented. Sit back & take time. Also a great location to meet a work colleague as the layout is perfect so very easy to talk. 
 ",5,2018,02,23
202,"Amazing property, outstanding location, comfortable bed","This is a very nice hotel.  The cozy lobby has two operating fireplaces, and the whole building is warm and welcoming.  The property is very well maintained, with everything clean and working flawlessly.  Great views from all sides of the building.  Nice bars and eating locations in the hotel.  Right across the street from Trinity College, and right on the tram line.  A short walk from Grafton street.",5,2018,02,22
202,Great location/nice experience,"I spent three nights at the Westin this past summer and felt like the experience was reasonably good though hotel rooms in Dublin have gotten so expensive! The room was pretty small for 360 Euros/night but it was neat, faced Trinity College and the service was great. Really nice public rooms, a great bar for drinks and tea and easy access to the most important sights downtown. The staff was also very helpful and I think really worked hard to personalize the service despite being full for a big rock concert that weekend. The Merrion was not available for all the nights I was there, so this was a reasonably good (though pricy) alternative.",4,2018,02,21
202,Great hotel in the Heart of Dublin,"My husband and I spent multiple nights here when we traveled to Ireland. The hotel is well appointed and in the heart of the city, making it easy to walk to historical sights of interest including Trinity College. You simply walk out the doors and you are in the middle of it all.  The hotel staff was helpful and available always. We had an interior courtyard view room, and I was amazed at how quiet the rooms were even though we were steps from a major roadway. The room was clean and big especially by European standards. The bed and linens were comfortable. The bathroom was especially nice with a large walk in shower. The breakfast was outstanding with fresh honey, breads and made to order eggs each day. One morning, we departed for a tour of Northern Ireland prior to the restaurant opening for breakfast and had room service.  It was outstanding. Hot and made to order with all the extras including fresh honey still on the comb. Doesn't get much better than that. We were not too impressed with the dinner at the onsite restaurant. The staff manager seemed over impressed with himself and the staff somewhat intimidated by him. The food was over-priced at a dinner and the worst meal we had during our 12 days in Ireland, not that it was bad- just not up to the quality of the others. I would highly recommend this hotel and will stay here again when I return to Ireland.",5,2018,02,18
202,"Beautiful Hotel, Excellent Service",I dined recently at the Westin Hotel and it was a fabulous experience. Staff were extremely pleasant and the food was sublime. The menu had a fanatic selection of dishes also. I would have no hesitation in recommending this hotel.,5,2018,02,18
202,Great Location - Just at the Heart of Dublin,"I really like to stay in the Westin when I go to Dublin because it is so conviniently located! The main shopping street, Temple Bar area, restauarnts - everything is just around the corner. Hotel offers a very good breakfast, especially a la carte options. Rooms are clean, quiet and warm. I highly recommend this hotel.",5,2018,02,17
202,Great centrally located hotel ,"Great location, close to the major sites.  Rooms were nice, bell desk was friendly.  As a family it worked well for us...across the street from the bars and restaurants.   Had a nice causal vibe, clean and safe.",4,2018,02,17
202,Enjoyable Stay,"We‚Äôve just come back from a wedding reception in the Westin and wanted to share what a wonderful time we had there. The hotel staff are friendly and very helpful especially the effortless check in. 

The facilities are great particularly the atrium, the Mint Bar and the well appointed ball room. Bedrooms are smart with incredibly comfortable beds we had a view of Trinity College. The central location is perfect for shopping and sightseeing.

Overall I cannot recommend this hotel highly enough!",5,2018,02,12
202,Beautiful Property- Christmas Stay,"Stayed at this property over the Christmas holiday. We were upgraded to suites with my Ambassador status and could not be more pleased. Staff were friendly and attentive. The bar had live music and and the cocktails were creative and top notch.

Would highly recommend,",5,2018,02,11
202,NICE HOTEL,"Very expensive hotel and after reading reviews I was looking forward to their special breakfast.  Very disappointing with the bacon floating in water and the hash browns like rubber.
I complained and they did asked if I wanted something from the kitchen I said an omelette please to be told there was a 6 Euro supplement!!! I was paying 370 Euros a night and they asked for a supplement for an omelette..
I leave it to you...",3,2018,02,06
202,Nice Afternoon Tea with the ladies,"We recently had afternoon tea here with a group of friends.  The setting was lovely, nice and bright and the table and decor were lovely.  The serving staff were also friendly and helpful.  The food itself was nice, sandwiches were tasty and selection of deserts were ok, not overly delicious but still nice to eat and nibble on. The crockery and tea sets we had were very cute.",4,2018,02,05
202,Romantic getaway,"What a special service! 

At the time of booking, we informed them about our special occasion and we were so happy to find a bottle of champagne in our room upon the arrival.

Position is fantastic and we loved so much having breakfast in their nice breakfast room overlooking the street.

Room was not so big, but well designed and the bed was really comfy.

At th bar they serve very good cocktails in a nice atmosphere.

Se strongly suggest the Westin for a romantic getaway or special occasions.",5,2018,02,02
202,Business trip,"Hotel in a great location close to all the main attractions of Dublin. Close proximity to the office was a key to the choice of hotel for me. The rooms are and food size, well appointed and very comfortable; especially the  beds. The level of service is very good and not overly fussy. The breakfasts were also excellent. ",4,2018,02,01
202,Good location,"Westin Dublin is located right next to Trinity college and a block away from temple bar district. This is about as close to center of city as you can get. It is hard to beat if you want to be in the middle of it all.
The building itself is somewhat dated. But they did a reasonable job of keeping it updated.
I do have a complaint and this is common in the Westin chain in multiple locations--ie their gym gear lending program which is often promoted all over their hotels. Westin hotels often do not have small or medium size gym clothing items available. I don't understand why the chain keeps promoting a program (good idea for travelers who want to pack light and keep up with workouts) that they cannot deliver. Either have the items available and promote it or cut the program!?! Also, why is it that only large-size guests have accommodation and not those who are smaller? Dublin Westin, like many of its cousins, fail to deliver in this department. If Westin staff are reading this, please make up your mind if you are really supporting this gear lending program. If not, please pull down your promotional posters. It is simply a reminder of your failure every time I see them.",4,2018,01,31
202,"Location, Comfort, and Style","The Westin Dublin is in the perfect location. It is close walking distance to major attractions. There is also a bus stop across the street for Airlink and Aircoach. The staff were extremely professional and friendly, and greeted me every time I walked through the door. I stayed in a classic room with a queen bed, which had an overly spacious bathroom and comfortable bed of Westin standards. I would absolutely stay here again.",5,2018,01,31
202,Great location,"The hotel is in a perfect place to explore all the key sights of Dublin, close to Temple Bar, Grafton Street, Trinity College, etc. 

There is a real shortage of hotels in Dublin, which naturally pushes up the costs of rooms. Therefore, you do end up paying more than you would in most other cities.

Check-in at The Westin was easy, the staff were friendly and very helpful. Our room was on the 5th floor, with a lovely view over the surrounding rooftops. The bed was very comfortable, there were plugs by the bed and complimentary water provided every day. The WiFi worked well.

The bathroom was good, with a bathtub and a separate shower. The shower wasn't as good as it could be, but not too bad. The toiletries provided were very good. 

We didn't eat at the hotel, as there are numerous eateries close to the hotel. 

I would certainly consider staying at this hotel on my next visit to Dublin.",5,2018,01,29
202,Almost perfect,"Hotel was very central, walking distance to everything I needed and the TempleBar is across the street for evening food and drink/entertainment. Lovely room on the 3rd floor, lots of space. Comfortable bed. Spotless and functional bathroom, with good amenities. Prompt and courteous check-in. Really top class breakfast. Staff were friendly. Checkout was super smooth. Airport shuttle bus stops very close for a 7 euro trip to the airport. Wifi was a bit slow.",5,2018,01,28
202,Location is the best!!,"This gorgeous hotel is located within walking distance to Grafton Street and Temple bar and Trinity College. (And I don‚Äôt mean Irish walking distance). I mean us from the states. Just five quick minutes to everywhere!!  Three restaurants in the hotel, including a bar which potentially could have music. Beds are super comfy! ",5,2018,01,28
202,"Deluxe corner suite, great service, perfect for traveling family","We are 2 discriminating adults and 2 spoiled (IMO) teenagers, usually packing as much into 3 weeks each summer as we can.  Our expectations were in check---- we booked this Westin because we're SPG members, and there wasn't a Ritz here. We could not have been happier with our stay at The Westin Dublin. Well-located, we were walking distance to everything we wanted to see and do. Our corner Deluxe Suite was well-lit and quite spacious by European standards, with a separate king bedroom and large bathroom (dual vanity, separate soaking tub and glass shower). Sitting room with little foyer, desk area and large seating area---- room for 2 cushy well-dressed twin beds for the boys and still plenty of room to move around.  (My boys said they were the most comfortable rollaways they've ever slept in!) Our Amex Platinum benefits provided in-room breakfast every morning, which was served promptly and abundantly every morning.  Our servers were very gracious and accommodating.  Any request we made was met in excess ---- as in, if we requested a  pitcher of water delivered to the room, we received the water, a bucket of ice, 4 fresh glasses, and 4 bottled waters to take with us on our excursions that day.  With a smile.  That was typical of all of our service here. Kudos also to the staff of doormen, who were always ready with the weather report and an umbrella as we ventured out each day.  Very close proximity to Trinity College --- take the tour led by student guides, tour the library and see the Book of Kells.  Lunch at The Bank just down the street.  And don't miss the Epic Museum...... Ireland is calling her children home...and she's doing a good job!",5,2018,01,27
202,Beautiful ,"I booked this hotel for a early valentines evening. The hotel was beautiful and the staff were very welcoming. 
The room was lovely with a very comfy bed that I wish I could of stayed in the whole stay. 
The bathroom was lovely with a wonderful rain shower. 

On our stay we went to visit The Mint Bar which is well worth a visit weather your staying at the hotel or not. 

There is also the option to rent gym gear which is the first time I have ever seen this in a hotel and I thought it was a great idea 

5 star service all round in a wonderful 5 star hotel. 

I will certainly love to visit again. ",5,2018,01,23
202,Wonderful city centre location,"I had an excellent first time stay on my own at this hotel, the staff could not be more helpful. I invited two cousins to join me for dinner and we had an exceptional meal, great service and fantastic food.
I am already planning my return, this time with my husband.",5,2018,01,23
202,Top stay,"Nothing too much trouble from any of the staff! Breakfast fantastic, room pleasant can‚Äôt wait to go back! The bar is quiet so if you‚Äôre looking for a bit of atmosphere just head straight out the front door and pubs surround you! ",5,2018,01,22
202,Afternoon Tea in the Atrium,Had afternoon tea here with my family.  This was a return trip as we had already visited last year for Afternoon Tea.  There is plenty to choose from and they were good enough to let us mix and match from the two different afternoon teas which were on offer.  the staff were extremely professional and polite.  The only down side is that last year we had to wait for our table and the same thing happened again this year.  I have had afternoon tea in several hotels around Dublin and this is the only hotel where we have had to wait for our table - only a small point and it didn't take from our enjoyment of the afternoon.,4,2018,01,22
202,Wonderful Location & Pleasant Staff,"We stayed at the Westin in Dublin for 8 days over the Christmas holidays in 2017. The hotel is very centrally located, right next to the Trinity College and Temple Bar area.
We took the Air Link express from the airport into the City Center, and it dropped us off at the College Green stop, which is about a 3-5 minute walk to the hotel. Factor this in if you have luggage. On our way out, we took the Aircoach service, which has a stop right opposite the hotel.

We stayed in a few different rooms as we broke up our stay between side trips. We found the queen size bed smaller than what we were used to by American standards and requested a room change. The rooms are lovely and depending on which side you are, offers a nice view of Trinity College.

The staff was very friendly and efficient. They made Christmas Eve very special by dropping off chocolates and some other goodies. I am not sure if this was only for preferred Marriot members, but it was a great touch. The breakfast staff also did a great job and was very pleasant. The only exception to the friendly staff, was the grouchy bartender on Christmas Day. 

Lots of the must do tourists spots are within a very walkable distance from the hotel.  Lots of convenience stores around, and a big Tesco a minute away.",5,2018,01,16
202,5 star experience ,"We‚Äôve just come back from a long weekend in the Westin, Dublin and wanted to share what a wonderful time we had there. The hotel staff are friendly and very helpful, we got a complimentary early check in and late check out. The facilities are great, particularly the atrium and the Mint Bar. Location is perfect. Bedrooms are smart with incredibly comfortable beds. And to top it off, we mentioned it was our sons 21st the previous week and they left a surprise cake in his room for him. Overall I cannot recommend this hotel highly enough !",5,2018,01,15
202,Quick Child Free Getaway ,"Great centrally located Hotel. Our standard room was small as expected for a city centre hotel but it was very tastefully decorated, very comfortable with a lovely king size bed. The bathroom was particularly nice and everything was spotlessly clean.

We ate in the Mint Bar in the basement which had a great vaulted roof. The gourmet hot dog and burger were very tasty.

The breakfast was exceptionnaly nice with a range of breads, pastries and cooked breakfast.

Staff at every contact point were professional, friendly and helpful.

We'll  be back to try the afternoon tea served in the atrium sometime. It looked great but was already booked out during our stay.

Highly recommend this hotel and we hope to stay again.",5,2018,01,14
202,"Luxury, peace and comfort in heart of Dublin","I grew up in Dublin and it is far from hotels I was raised but I treated myself to a stay in the Westin recently. I chose it for the location in the heart of Dublin. It is in close proximity to shopping, bars for live music and Stephens Green. Despite its location, the property itself is peaceful and quiet with excellent amenities for relaxing with an Irish Times. The basic room was excellent with a great bathroom, bed linens and comfort. I look forward to returning with my family to use this great space as a jumping off point to enjoy the city. Oh and by the way! For the frugal among you, the aircoach leaves across the street for a non-stop trip to the airport for around 6 Euro!",5,2018,01,13
202,Nice hotel that is very well located!,"Stayed there for one night and was very happy with the appearance of the room and service I received. But the best part is the location of the hotel. It was conveniently located in the heart of Dublin making everything accessible. Also very easy to get to the airport via the air coach bus. 

Only thing is the internet was a bit slow.",5,2018,01,11
202,Excellent location,"Just returned from our stay here at the Westin Dublin~we were even lucky enough to have 2 days of sunshine in January! We arrived quite frazzled after the airline having lost our luggage and my only complaint is that the seemingly empathetic bellman (Who shall remain nameless but really made me angry) who listened to our story, accepted $, said he would make a copy of our information and promised to assist us and tell the next bellman on duty...he did not and when we later came down to check on status, they had no idea what we were talking about. That sucked. Luckily around 10 pm it miraculously showed up.
This hotel is located perfectly, it‚Äôs beautiful and the adjoining rooms are a lifesaver for families. Gorgeous, clean rooms with marble bathrooms and a nice big tub (which I fell asleep in, it was so relaxing). I highly recommend this hotel and the restaurants & bar in the basement are very cool. 
Would‚Äôve given higher rating if not for that shady bellman...

202,Afternoon gin,We received a gift from my daughter for afternoon tea here . Staff very attentitive . We got Hendricks gin in a tea pot infused with apple juice and fresh mint delish. Food excellent . Afterwards we adjourned to bar downstairs the vaults as this hotel was formally a bank . My daughter joined us here and she had food here all very good ,5,2018,01,07
202,Fabulous Hotel,"We loved this hotel!!  I went to Dublin with a dear friend. We were given a terrific room - it was a writer's suite, but one that was handicap accessible.  The room was huge.  Two large, comfortable beds.  A huge bathroom with a great shower (hot and with good stream) and a tub, plus a long marble ledge for makeup, etc.  The closet area was well lit.  There was a fridge in the room.  This was very large even by American standards.

The hotel staff were very accommodating.  There is a fitness area; we used the bathroom there to freshen up before our room was ready.  It has a shower if one needed it.

There is a bar in the basement of the hotel.  The night we were there, a jazzy, zootsuit type band was playing.",5,2018,01,06
202,"Nice property, and very central.","Came back here after a number of years (almost ten). I enjoyed my stay more this time. Had a nice ""writer's room"" with a great view of Trinity and was able to sleep very well.  Front staff is quite friendly and helpful.  Only ate once in the restaurant (which was lightly trafficked, it seems) and had fine room service.

Good for a business traveler.",4,2018,01,05
202,Did not disappoint,Used award certificate for the one night layover in Dublin and got upgraded to premium room as a platinum. Great experience overall. Very centrally located making all the tourist sites in walking distance. Comfortable room and beds with beautifully marbled bathroom. Was not able to have the buffet breakfast due to the early flight next morning but will definitely stay here again if come back!,5,2018,01,02
202,Top Class,"The hotel was great, had the Christmas carols in the lobby and the hotel was really clean and the staff were very good, breakfast was top class.

There was a good atmosphere in the bar in he evening time and the light bites were very tasty!

Will be back for my next visit to Dublin...",5,2018,01,02
202,Never Disappointed,"We are never been disappointed when we stay at The Westin Dublin.  From the friendly greetings (by name from some of the familiar faces), the effortless check-in, to the pure luxury of the beds.  We must have stayed here 5 or 6 times already but still look forward to returning each time.  Some nice Welcome/Christmas gifts in the room made us feel ""at home"".

See you all in February!",5,2018,01,02
202,Xmas break,"Sorry to say not a five star hotel. Service poor apart from 2-3 nice staff. appeared disorganized at breakfast, food choice poor and not of 5 star quality. Stayed in better 3-4 star hotels. Rooms ok, but again the extra touches you would expect in a 5 star hotel just wasn‚Äôt there. The noise from fan in bathrooms that never went off was annoying. Not into reviewing negatively but for price paid constructive criticism had to be highlighted . ",2,2017,12,31
202,Just class!,"I attended a small business function where canap√©s and drinks were served. Canap√©s were beautifully presented, tasty and hot. Staff were quietly professional. 
After the event, I popped into the Mint Bar. Almost empty but it‚Äôs a distinctive venue. The proscecco was excellent! Great hotel. ",5,2017,12,29
202,Disappointing ,"After staying there for the last ten years as a platinum guest, I am horrified at the lack of customer service this year.  I won‚Äôt be going back.  Not sure if the problem is local ised or because they were taken over  by Marriott.   ",1,2017,12,24
202,Comfy,"Nice hotel in the middle of the city, pretty close to the famous Temple Bar area and just next to the Trinity College. The room was clean and comfortable. Highly recommend the afternoon tea at the Atrium Lounge.",4,2017,12,23
202,"Ok at best, probably trending to disappointing","This must be one of the weakest spots in the Westin chain. 
What was booked as a Deluxe Room (looks very nice on the photos on the hotel website, obviously) turned out to be a lengthy tube with not much room to move around, a mouldy bathroom and lights that were so poorly switched and wired that there was no bedside light without illuminating the entire room (in all fairness the lighting issue was fixed after I complained). The bed was moderately comfortable, room service had to prompted late afternoon to make up room after we had been out form 9 until 4pm. 
The Mezzanine bar was staffed by a rather disinterested young lady who preferred retreating into the staff room rather then serving guests. The breakfast buffet provided a limited small selection of food. 
All in all really a rather disappointing, poor value for money experience, no need to go back. The location is great, but the Westin is not the only place in the area.",3,2017,12,22
202,Very nice ,"My wife and I stayed here in November. We had a great time and will stay here again when we come back to Ireland. The hotel definitely has a classic old school feel to it yet very nicely maintained. The bar/pub downstairs is great we had a lot of fun there before we would go out to dinner.  The hotel is in a great location, very close to almost everything. The concierge was also a big help with making reservations for dinner and various attractions. We have nothing bad to say about this hotel. ",5,2017,12,14
202,ok. a bit expensive for what it offers,the best thing about the hotel is its location. very central with easy access to shops and sights. the rooms were somewhat small but clean. room service was mediocre with room not getting cleaned until after 4 pm and then upon complaint. our room overlooked an internal courtyard. it was very dim and needs better lighting. also the noise from the restaurant in the courtyard went on until late at night and was disruptive to sleep. gym is small. 4 treadmills and 2 ellipticals and 2 bikes as well as weights. very dark and no windows. not pleasant. the bar is quite nice with good service. all in all a mediocre experience except for great location and good concierge service too.,4,2017,12,10
202,The perfect place to stay in Dublin,"I just returned from a week at the Westin Dublin and I will never stay anywhere else when I visit there again. First of all, I had the warmest of welcomes when I arrived and was instantly made to feel at home. The hotel was so beautifully decorated for Christmas with a crackling fire adding a charm to the reception area. 

I also have to say traveling with my American Express card, made me eligible for a room upgrade and the Westin was generous enough to book me in one of their beautiful 2-story library suites. It was so wonderful to have that beautiful room to come back to after packing in a full day of activities. 

The staff was so accommodating and helpful, the bed was an oasis and the food was fantastic. All of this and a perfectly situated hotel that is minutes from absolutely everything--Grafton Street, Trinity College, Temple Bar (why go there? you pay too much for drinks and never meet an Irish person), Henry St, O'Connell St. etc., etc., etc. 

Loved this hotel. Thank you Westin Dublin for making my stay in your gorgeous city even more memorable.",5,2017,12,09
202,"Premium Economy, not First Class","The receptionist said ""well, for the kind of category of room you booked it's a very nice one."" She frowned and looked at us like we were hiding something.  We should have figured something was off then but we were very jet-lagged. Our room overlooked Trinity College on a low floor and had a queen bed. We'd just stayed in superb hotels and had the idea we were entering another 5 star establishment. We were wrong.

The mattress clearly hadn't been turned in a while, you can't get around the bed without carefully negotiating the narrow space to avoid stubbing your toe, the only way to turn off a light on one side of the bed required shutting off all the lights (so when that person was ready to sleep, it was a mandate.)  The room's  layout is ridiculous.  The street noise was loud, and when we spoke to the night manager he offered us a room on a different floor that he promised would be no bigger. On the map it looked punishingly small and dark so we stayed put. No follow up call for our second night. We were too tired to protest and the hotel was too busy to care.

I can overlook a lot, but my last straw was a door hanger encouraging guests to ""Make a Green Choice"" to forgo full housekeeping - so absolutely no cleaning at all - housekeeping would not enter your room. In return for a dirty room you get ""5.00"" to spend at food and beverage venues (where? what currency?) OR 500 SPG points that you can donate to Unicef. If Westin was so interested in the environment they might want to invest in high efficiency toilets.  I haven't seen an old slow filling-cistern in a hotel for a long time. Most hotels allow you to keep your sheets and towels to ""keep green"" and we almost always opt in. But I want a clean bathroom and some vacuuming. The only people who seem to benefit from this is the hotel to keep labor costs down. And it denies the housekeeping staff their tips.

The breakfast room is large and the staff is lovely, but it went from peaceful respite to chaotic trough as it got busy.

We are spoiled. We stay in real 5 star hotels often, where customer service, comfort and atmosphere are most important. This is an industrial tourist hotel with a large lobby that might impress some, but it's just premium economy, not first class.

And, even if we'd earned our 5.00 from foregoing housekeeping, the hotel restaurant and bar were fully booked for our entire stay.",3,2017,12,09
202,Beautiful Hotel in the Heart of Dublin,"My first time in Dublin for a business trip and the Westin Dublin did not disappoint. Its a stately hotel and when you arrive you are warmly greeted by the doorman. Check in fast and friendly. Rooms were large in particular for Europe although you do pay for the privilege at well over 350 Euro a night. Beds are comfy, high end bedding round out your typical Westin experience. Location is where this hotel really shines. Approximately 50 meters from Fleet Street which is a pedestrian only cobbled stoned road bordered by many pubs, shops and restaurants. Live music, great food and a real great vibe makes it a great place to explore. One downside is the gym. Its on the small side with little in the way of free weights. Breakfast at the restaurant downstairs was delicious.",5,2017,12,07
202,Great hotel in Good Location,This hotel is right in the heart of Dublin a quick walk to the Temple Bar area and Trinity College.  The room we had was great.  It was pretty large and well maintained. The staff was extremely friendly and accommodating (we arrived pretty early and they checked our bags and called when our room was ready).  We'd  absolutely visit again if in Dublin.,5,2017,12,07
202,Lovely and comfortable,"Where should you locate yourself when you visit a country that is bursting with character? The Westin is the perfect choice of location, close to Trinity College and Temple Bar. Our hotel room was lovely and deliciously comfortable. The bed was large and the room was sizable enough to relax comfortably. The bathroom had a shower and a bath. The view from the room wasn‚Äôt spectacular, but that isn‚Äôt a criticism given that we were based in the middle of a city. Sadly the breakfast was not one of the hotel‚Äôs strong points during our stay. We waited extended periods for our coffee and freshly cooked eggs. It was also frustrating waiting for the self-service buffet to be replenished. The most extraordinary incident during breakfast one morning was asking a waitress for some butter. Incredulously she leant over to the adjacent table and offered us the leftover butter from the previous guests. Admittedly the breakfast period was fairly busy, but we elected to stay at a 5 star hotel and paid 5 star rates for a reason.",4,2017,12,07
202,Good public areas but variable room quality,"I am reticent to write a review here as I was in Dublin for a corporate event, so didn't pay for my stay at this hotel.  However I wanted to highlight a specific issue with the hotel, in that we stayed in a room without windows.  It had a skylight, and a couple of tiny cut-out windows, as if the room had been squeezed into part of the attic.  The public areas of the hotel were very grand, and service in the Mint Bar and breakfast room were good, but the negative impression of the room negated this and I couldn't recommend staying here on that basis.",3,2017,12,05
202,Great Location,"This hotel's location is excellent. Trinity College is the across the street from the hotel and so is the Temple bar street. If you are looking for the best location to stay in Dublin, you can't beat this hotel. When you walk into the hotel, you will smell the famous Westin white tea scent. It is very relaxing. Even though the hotel is located in the center of Dublin city, once you go into your hotel room, you don't hear any noise from outside. I also like the fact that they have a shower and also bathtub in all rooms.
They have a unique lounge on the 2nd floor that you can have a coffee or tea. They also have a nice restaurant inside the hotel. They have many great meeting rooms so they seem very busy always at the front desk.",5,2017,12,04
202,"Great location, great service","Not only are you right in the heart of everything but the rooms are great here.  The staff is extremely friendly and I would recommend adding the breakfast as they have a great spread.

Only really down side is the gym is small and not as good as other hotels I have stayed at.

Mint bar downstairs is always crowded and they make great mixed drinks",4,2017,12,03
202,Perfect Place to Stay in Dublin,"I stayed at the Westin Dublin for a weekend in September. This hotel is excellent and very well located. It is however, very expensive often over $450 USD per night. If visiting Dublin this should be on your list along with the Fitzwilliam and Four Seasons. I would absolutely stay here again.

Location: The hotel is located a short walk from Temple Bar and Grafton Street. It is 20-25 minute drive from the airport.  It is a 15-20 minute walk from the Guiness Storehouse and next to Trinity College. Overall, I did not take a taxi the entire time, I walked everywhere.

Service: Hotel front desk staff, housekeeping and restaurant service were all excellent.   There is nothing bad to say about the staff.

Rooms: Generally smaller, but maintained well. Beds are Westin beds which are very comfortable. If you can get an upgraded room go for it. Hotel is more of a classic style and not a typical corporate looking westin.

Restaurant: Breakfast at the hotel was excellent and included made to order eggs, pancakes, waffles and included coffee drinks. I really enjoyed breakfast each morning and glad it was included otherwise it was over 30 euros per person. 

Overall: This is a great hotel and I would absolutely stay here again. There are much cheaper options so be prepared to pay a lot.",5,2017,12,02
202,"Great location, large room","The Westin Dublin is a fantastic business and tourist hotel in central Dublin. The location is everything you‚Äôd want in a city hotel, close to many points of interest and providing a great base from which to discover Dublin. The room itself was ugh some of my colleagues didn‚Äôt enjoy such a big room and my view overlooking the road was also great. The bathroom was a nice size and well maintained. There is a small but nice gym located on the property and the front desk staff are particularly lovely. As a tourist, I wouldn‚Äôt consider the Westin Dublin one of the grand dames of the global hotel circuit, but it certainly is nice. When compared to many of the other hotels in Ireland, it really does feel quite indulgent.",4,2017,12,02
202,"Good location and ambience; not quite the 5-star experience though, for the price","My wife and I spent one night here; we found it a good hotel in an excellent location.

It was expensive (Irish Breakfast at ‚Ç¨25; Cappucino at ‚Ç¨5) and the recent reconfiguration of traffic has left it difficult to access by car (valet parking a must but it will cost you ‚Ç¨28!).

The room was comfortable, but small, with very small ""sunken"" windows.

We didn't really have anything to complain about, but for the price, we felt that we would have had slightly better value for money overall at one of the comparable 5-star hotels in Dublin City centre",4,2017,12,01
202,Perfect location for tourists in Dublin,"As tourists in Dublin for only 5 days, we were mostly concerned about location so that we could get to our tours quickly and easily. This was the perfect spot, only a 5 minute walk to the Molly Malone statue where all the bus tours meet.

We asked for an early check-in since we were arriving at 8:30am, and they did not disappoint us, we were so happy to see that comfortable king bed after our Red eye from the US. Our room was a handicapped room, so it had no tub, only the shower surrounded by curtains and the drain in the floor. It was pretty odd. Also, there were handicapped bars all over the bathroom. It was clearly made for wheelchairs but made it uncomfortable for non-wheelchair bound folks because eventhough its a HUGE bathroom, there was limited sink space or a place by the shower to put your shampoo, etc. Also, plugs were only for oxygen, etc and no hairdryer plugs in the bathroom. The only regular plug in the whole unit was by the coffee maker. The rest were for medical devices. There were also emergency strings in the bathroom and next to the bed, etc. So this was not a room where curious children would be comfortable. 

That being said, the room was in excellent condition, but no windows to see outside. There were skylights tho, so we could get some daylight. Since we weren't in the room during the day, this was no big deal, we left at 6:30am and came back after 8pm,  so we only there to sleep anyway. One note of caution, most of the tours meet at 6:40 or 6:50, and room service and all restaurants don't open until 6:45 or 7. There is a ""coffee"" maker (Nespresso) maker in the room, which we were not fans of.  So grabbing something to eat or a coffee before your tour is tough going. Even Starbucks across the street opened at 7 so it was too late to grab something before the tour.
 
The only meal we ate at the Westin was breakfast our final day, its a huge buffet with scrambled ""eggs"", bacon/ham, oatmeals, and loads of breads and sweets. And real coffee! and tea.  (they also have ala cart).

All in all this was a fine place to land, or somewhere nearby if you want to be in the middle of everything.",4,2017,11,27
202,The place to stay in the city center,"The hotel is convenient and within walking distance to most attractions in Dublin city center.  In addition, the hotel feels upscale with attractive, comfortable and quiet rooms.  We enjoyed our meals, both in the courtyard atrium and the main dining room, and the staff was attentive but not intrusive.  In summary, this is a great place to come back to after a long day of walking and site seeing.",5,2017,11,26
202,Nice downtown hotel,"First visit in Dublin and nice choice of hotel if you need something downtown.  Building is beautiful and easy walk to many restaurants and bars.

One complaint was room given was and accessible room and there were no windows except for small skylights?  Bathroom of course was designed for wheelchairs which is ok but would rather have a regular bathroom.

Will stay again but hopefully Westin will assign a better room.

",4,2017,11,25
202,Great Location,"The hotel was clean and the staff was friendly. The rooms were spacious and the bed was very comfortable. The location of the hotel is close to nearly everything we wanted to do in Dublin. It's close to the shopping district, the Temple Bar, and Trinity College. I would definitely stay here again.",4,2017,11,25
202,"Great location, staff and hotel",I stayed at the Westin during my recent business trip to Dublin.  They had my room ready when I arrived early in the morning which was so necessary for such a long trip.  They plan for those long distance travelers and had everything I needed in the room or with room service.  My room was perfect in size - the bathroom was very elegant and it had a beautiful bathtub.  Room service was fast and the food wonderful.  The restaurant within the hotel was fantastic.,5,2017,11,24
202,Fabulous location,"This is the next location in Dublin you could ask for, walking distance to everything. As far as the stay goes, great room, comfortable beds per Westin standards. Quiet rooms as well! We didn‚Äôt see anything in the hotel for amenities as we wanted to enjoy as much outside as we could. The staff were pleasant and helpful. I found parking extremely expensive at close to 30 euros a night, eek! But...that‚Äôs Dublin. Was great valet service which wad appreciated. ",4,2017,11,24
202,Luxury feel in the heart of the city,We stayed at the Westin last weekend and from the moment we stepped inside it had a warm luxury feel that stayed throughout our stay.. fires lit in the reception area were a great welcome in a cold November day! We had an internal room which at first felt like we were missing out on a city view but we soon found out that it meant an uninterrupted nights sleep as we didn‚Äôt hear the noise from the hustle and bustle of the Dublin night life!! The location is excellent as everything is on your doorstep and you can walk everywhere easily.. we were well looked after and you certainly get that Irish welcome which is first class! We will be back..,5,2017,11,22
202,A great treat!,"After spending a few nights in an old property on the outskirts of the city it was a pleasure to relax with several nights at the Westin. The accommodations were first rate, the staff was wonderful and it was an effortless experience. Just what I needed after a few nights at a horrible old property. The Westin is perfectly located and even with the hurricane coming through it was a nice time.",5,2017,11,20
202,Five-Star Experience!,"We recently stayed at the Westin Dublin for three nights and could not have been more pleased!  Generally, I do not review hotels unless exceptionally good or bad--the Westin falls into the exceptionally good category.  First, the location is perfect for visiting Dublin--central to all the sites (across the street from Trinity College) as well as shopping and restaurants.  Second, the staff is amazing--all most helpful, customer oriented, and great attitudes!  Concierges were plentiful and most helpful--can't tell you how many Starwood hotels we have stayed at where you can never find the ""one"" concierge--or the person is tied up with someone for hours!  Westin Dublin is well staffed in this area and easy to get a hold of for assistance.  Third, the hotel is in a beautiful older building, the atmosphere is warm and inviting, and it is a very small hotel--only four floors!  Fourth, the rooms are nicely appointed and spacious and typical of what you would find at other well-run Westin hotels.  Finally, the restaurant was nice--we had lunch there and it was more than adequate.  However, the buffet breakfasts were outstanding.  All in all, simply a great experience at the Westin Dublin and I would highly recommend to others!  Well done to management and the staff for running a top notch hotel!",5,2017,11,20
202,A very pleasant stay,"From the start this was positive - excellent and efficient welcome on reception- airy and large room fit for 3 - a wonderful bar downstairs that had a buzz about it 

I did find the water pressure in the rooms was weak and stand in shower was somewhat disappointing for a 5 star hotel

The doors in the lift have taken some hammering and could do with a little paint

However breakfast was excellent , staff well trained and choices and quality food very good 

It‚Äôs probably the best centre of town hotel in Dublin with OConnell Street and Grafton St within 5 minutes each way and the new Luas outside front door 

Shhh! - don‚Äôt tell anyone about this hotel as I want to get in next time !!",4,2017,11,19
202,Friendly staff and a beautiful hotel ‚ú®,"Came here for tea and some light refreshments, its quite relaxing, luxurious and most of all the staffs are very welcoming and friendly. The hotel is well decorated to a high standard. Will definitely be back again for the lovely lounge ü•Ç",5,2017,11,18
202,"not a good start, bud ended well","I arrived with my daughter and were given the room with broken air condition so we were freezing. 
We have booked the room with the street view but as far as hotel was fully booked there was no possibilities to get another of the same kind.
We were very disappointed but Anne Marie from the front office was so helpful and trying  so hard to find something that would suit us and we would love.
At the end we stayed in an inner room overlooking the inner courtyard, so there is no too much of a daylight and even though you have a feeling there is no air as far as you can't open windows to open air, we loved the room.
The room had a living part and a small bedroom without the windows, but the bed was fantastic and we slept great.
Marie Anne treated us with a bottle of wine and artisan chocolate, thank you.
The bathroom was really great with a bath tub and a separate shower.
The breakfast could have been better. We would have expected more from such a hotel.
The fantastic fact about the hotel is the bus stop for airport which is exactly across the entrance to the hotel. Very easy and pleasant and cheap way to get to the airport.
The overall feeling is positive and we will come back for sure next time we're in Dublin",4,2017,11,18
202,Westin Hotel delivers,"The Westin is in a fantastic location opposite Trinity , we were driving and so due to the new tram lines passing just outside the front door valet parking is around the corner. This is a large hotel in a landmark building rooms are comfortable and bathrooms covered in marble. Staff are well trained etc. We ate elsewhere . Would recommend comfortable and a little luxurious.",4,2017,11,18
202,Enjoyed our stay,"My husband & I thoroughly enjoyed our stay.  We stayed in the wonderful ""College Suite""
and it was lovely.  We had an upstairs and a downstairs area.  The upstairs had a comfortable seating area, Nespresso machine, and a beautiful marble steam room which was heavenly.   Downstairs was a very comfortable bed, a bathroom with a shower and large jacuzzi, a toilet and a bidet.   There were plenty of towels and toiletries and the windows opened.  We had a lovely view of the college and because the glass was double paned the room was very quiet.  My husband especially appreciated the thick curtains which provided for a dark room for good sleeping.  The staff was friendly and their was a buffet breakfast available.  We had dinner one night in the restaurant and it was our favorite meal in Dublin....absolutely delicious!",5,2017,11,17
202,Heavenly ,"Seriously one of the best sleeps I‚Äôve had in a hotel. The room was excellent and the bath devine. The bed was seriously wonderful after a week on awful (other) hotel beds. 

I called reception and they sent up bath salts for a weary travelling body and had a lovely hot bath. 

The bar in the old vault was just what I needed. 

A perfect location for exploring Dublin. Close to the river, pubs and shops. An easy enough walk from the train station to access the rest of Ireland. 

If I return to Dublin I will be staying at the Westin. ",5,2017,11,16
202,Unfriendly and disappointing,"Dark atmosphere is maybe the designer decision but why is the staff so unfriendly ? One  can go in and out of the hotel 10 times a day, meet hotel personal at the corridor (very long ones) and no one will smile or say good morning‚Ä¶..good evening .
Shower has no glass door and the shower itself is so close to the wall that you need to stand very close to the wall.
Minibar isn‚Äôt full with what it should have ‚Äì I am still looking for those Pringles and the red wine.
They forgot to clean the room ‚Ä¶
Not what I would expect from  a Westin property.",3,2017,11,16
202,Hurdle over the bathtub into the shower ,"The Westin is in a lovely old building and location wise you couldn‚Äôt go wrong. The rooms are are a good size but this hotel lacks attention to detail. For a five star hotel I expect to be able to walk into a shower and enjoy it rather than have to hurdle over the bathtub. I stayed here on two occasions, the first time was on the fourth floor which had a better quality bathroom but then the tv and the Nespresso machine didn‚Äôt work. The second stay was on the third floor which had the combined bathtub and shower. I also rang the service desk to arrange for a toothbrush and shaving kit, had to call three times before something arrived. The breakfast buffet is fine but not a great selection. I can‚Äôt say that the stay at this hotel was five stars but it has a great location and is comfortable and clean.Hopefully with greater attention to detail they can improve the customer experience.",4,2017,11,15
202,Great Hotel to visit the city,"This hotel is centrally located in the centre of town. Generally you will not need to get many taxis ( perhaps to the Guinness factory or Jameson Distillery). Hotel itself is modern and the staff are very friendly. Rooms are very comfortable and clean and provide a great nights sleep.
Great bar in the basement providing nice cocktails - its a good place to start the night off. The area know as Temple Bar where all the night life is -  is just across the road.
Breakfast was very good.
Overall I couldn't find a negative thing to say about the hotel",5,2017,11,15
202,Good to come home to...,Great experience at this hotel.  It is in a wonderful location--lots and lots to do within easy walking distance. The concierge team was exceptional. They were most helpful in finding hotels and giving directions and other suggestions.  Had the best meal in Dublin thanks to the concierge. Crescenzi and Dunne Restaurant.,5,2017,11,14
202,Amazing location,"This hotel is amazing. The beds are extremely comfortable. In fact, as soon as we arrived at the hotel, IÔ∏è fell asleep on one of the beds for 18 hours (of course, from jet lag)! It is in a great location, in walking to distance to almost everything. Temple bar is right down the street, including Dublin castle and trinity college. All of the staff was exceptionally friendly. ",5,2017,11,12
202,A Return to the Westin,"After spending a week at the Westin in 2015, I decided on a return visit to Dublin in October of 2017. Since I enjoyed my previous stay, I decided to have my travel agent book the Westin again for my family.  The hotel was as I remembered it, centrally located. The room was nice but rather smaller than my previous room.  Staff was kind and responsive and the included breakfast was excellent.

My concern regards the SPG points I should have been awarded for our stay. In 2015 I was awarded points for the weeklong stay but in 2017 I was told that no points would be awarded because I had booked through a travel agent! Same travel agent was used in 2015! Was it not my money used to pay for our stay in 2017, as it was in 2015? Very disappointing! :-(",4,2017,11,09
202,Wonderful Location in a Great City,"This being my first trip to Dublin, and with only a day-and-a-half to spend before going to a business conference, I chose the Westin Dublin for my stay.  It's very centrally located - convenient to Trinity College, Temple Bar, shopping, great restaurants, historical sights - just about everything!  Both the hotel itself and my room as well had a very welcoming feel, and the Heavenly Bed makes for a very restful stay!  All of the staff that I met were very friendly and helpful, and the doorman went out of his way to get a taxi for me when they were in short supply during the Dublin Marathon.  This is a wonderful place to stay that I would recommend completely!",5,2017,11,08
202,In the middle of everything!,"The Westin is located in a prime area just a couple of blocks to Trinity College where the Book of Kells is.  Most tourist areas are within walking or a short cab/uber drive away.  The hotel, itself is wonderful.  Our room had plenty of space.  I appreciated the large bathroom with a high sided tub and shower.  The staff were great.  I was having some knee pain and the staff provided me with ice whenever I needed it.  We tried the hotel restaurant for breakfast.  It was very pleasant and the food was good.  The concierge staff and doormen were awesome.  Parking in front of the hotel is not allowed.  So, the doormen can get you a cab but it will be on the side street.  They always escorted me to the cab to make sure I had the right one.  Overall, this Westin was a good experience!",5,2017,11,08
202,Great Location for Tourists and Great Service,"My wife and I arrived on a Sunday morning and Hurricane Ophelia was expected to hit Dublin Monday afternoon. Ireland, not used to such extreme weather was battening down their hatches. Dublin stopped all bus and train service from Monday at 1:00pm to Tuesday morning. And all national institutions were closed like the Jail, the museums, even the Guinness factory.

The good news is Dublin did not get hit too badly (the cab drivers we spoke with the next day were all complaining about an overreaction). So with a limited amount of time my wife and I set out on foot to explore Dublin.

The Westin is beautifully located a half block from Trinity College and very close to the Temple Bar neighborhood. We walked east to the Jail and North across the river. 

The Westin staff could not have been more helpful, especially with the hurricane arriving soon. Most of the pubs were closed (workers couldn't get in without public transit).but the concierge steered us to The Bank which is located in the former National Bank of Ireland. 

But the most impressive service provided was the day after we left. We had purchased some scarves as gifts and stuck them in one of my wife's bags. When we got to our new hotel we could not find the bag. I called the Westin and they said they did not have it. I had to go back into Dublin the next day so I stopped by the Westin just to make sure they didn't have our bag. 

I explained what happened to the front desk, they relayed my concern to the concierge and 10 minutes later he came to me with a print out from their security camera. It showed my wife leaving the hotel the day before and the missing bag was clearly over her shoulder. It turns out the new hotel had sent it to the wrong room. But the Westin was right on top of the situation.",5,2017,11,07
202,Relaxing and quiet in a central location,"I missed a flight and had an unexpected overnight in Dublin and this comfortable hotel gave me the restful respite I needed. The historic building is tastefully updated and an interior courtyard room was very quiet. Public spaces seem attractive, but I ventured outside instead since the location was near the university and other landmarks, shopping district, St. Stephen's Green, etc.
Shuttle buses from Dublin Airport go directly to this location. Not inexpensive but I felt the comfort was worth it.",4,2017,11,07
202,Peculiar afternoon tea.,"Afternoon tea which was Gin, apple juice and some herb served in lovely teapots and China cups and saucers. One layer of savouries and two layers of little cakes, all delicious. I felt it was quite expensive 39 euros each, but ok for a special occasion. A lot of people however, looked like they dined there every day. The was a suited, booted and top hat wearing doorman and the hotel was beautiful, I believe the Weston is a superior chain of hotel. The afternoon tea was served in an atrium, and the staff were very experienced as you would expect. My only criticism would be that there appeared to be more sofa and low chairs with tables so you might need to ask to sit at a table with chairs if you suffer with back problems or bad knees.",4,2017,11,07
202,Pure luxury,This hotel is ideally situated to explore  Dublin. Everything about the place was superb especially the staff. They were so helpful . We didn't know Dublin at all and they directed us to all the different places we wanted to find. They also kept our bag after checkout and we were able to collect it later. The breakfast was just beautiful with choice being the operative word. This was a truly beautiful place to stay.,5,2017,11,04
202,One of the loveliest Hotels- Fantastic Location and Wonderful Staff,"I would highly recommend this hotel. We had a three night stay. The location is perfect- close to shopping, restaurants and tourist sites. Upon our arrival all the staff was wonderful, friendly, professional and helpful. Such a beautiful and warm hotel; very welcoming and you feel right at home. The rooms were spacious, comfortable and lovely as were the bathrooms; very, very clean and elegant. The hotel is beautifully decorated throughout. All the Concierges were so very helpful, friendly and well informed- the best I have had met during my travels. We stayed during hurricane Ophelia so it was rather busy but all of the staff throughout the hotel were helpful, professional and ensured everyone was taken care of and accommodated. I would highly recommend the afternoon tea- so delightful and they offer a gluten free tea which was spectacular and absolutely delicious. I would recommend you stay here without reservation.",5,2017,11,03
202,"Great location, superb staff","We stayed here with two young children and grandparents, all with different needs. The hotel met everybody's unique concerns and we enjoyed it immensely.  They were also tremendously helpful locating a bag that had been left in a Taxi.

The services for children exceeded expectations and my kids loved the spacious room.

The Mint Bar was an excellent place for a pint of cold Guinness.",5,2017,10,31
202,Terrific location and lovely room,"Location is in the middle of town and across the street from Trinity College. We could walk to great restaurants and tourist spots. We didn‚Äôt go far because a storm was passing through of strong wind and luckily only rain on one day. Wished the gym had workout mats.

Kenneth was a great Concierge figuring out an inland golf course to avoid high wind from the ocean and where formal golf clothes weren‚Äôt required‚Äîjust played once. Also great at figuring out restaurants. 

Loved our room. My husband is a Starwood Platinum member category and our suite was lovely.

Terrific buffet breakfast, and restaurant was great for dinner. Were introduced to the fab hard crusted Irish bread in the morning, great jams, honey served in a honeycomb, and cheeses and meats, and smoked salmon. Fun to experience.",4,2017,10,29
202,The reason we like spg and Westin is our experience with Westin Dublin,"We traveled through the night, rented car at the Dublin Airport and started to travel to the Westin. During our drive there was a running marathon and roads were closed around the hotel. We called the hotel and they gave us perfect directions to get to the hotel. Upon arriving to the hotel the door man was amazing. He greeted us and showed us where to park to unload. We never touched a piece of luggage. 
We were too early for reservation, however the staff were amazing and looked after our luggage. 
Ann Marie and Eva were AMAZING!
We explored Dublin and upon arrival back to hotel our luggage was in our room.  My wife mentioned it was my birthday and Ann Marie gave us a lovely treat for my birthday.  
We picked up a box of 6 specialty donuts and they put them in the room so we didn‚Äôt have to carry them while exploring Dublin. 
Vacations are moments and memories and the Westin and especially the staff have created a life long amazing memory.
Oh yes we had two junior suites and we loved them. A beautiful room, everything we needed was in room and more than met our expectations.
So much to see and do all around the hotel and able to walk to so many great areas.
I would like to say Thank You",5,2017,10,29
202,"Stayed here during the hurricane, excellent location for the city","Very nice and extremely well decorated and furnished hotel. The food in the cellar bar was very good. Breakfast is overpriced but in line with Westins. It‚Äôs an excellent location for sightseeing and meetings and feels luxurious, which it should do for the price !",4,2017,10,25
202,Fantastic stay and experience,"This is the second time I've stayed at this hotel and this was a fantastic experience.

I arrived at the hotel around 2:30pm and my room wasn't ready yet.  Not a problem since we left our bags and went for a few drinks.  I got a phone call just after 4pm to say the room was ready.  We walked back to the hotel and was greeted at reception with a suite upgrade.  I travel a lot on business and I'm an SPG Gold Member.  The original room was booked using free nights so to get upgraded to a suite when I hadn't paid anything for the room was a welcomed bonus.

The O'Connell suite was lovely and had lot of space in the living room, bedroom, and bathroom.  The beds are comfy as always and although the room looked onto O'Connell Street, the double glazed windows kept out the noise fully.  

We ate in Moreland's Grill which was great.  Steak and wine was lovely.  Highly recommend anyone to try here if struggling for a last minute reservation elsewhere in Dublin (like we were).

The Mint Bar was also great.  There was some live music (Michael Bubl√© impersonator I think) but he had people up dancing and had a brilliant voice.

We managed to secure a late checkout the next day which helped sleep off some the booze the night before.

All in all a great experience from check-in to check-out.  I'll definitely be back.",5,2017,10,24
202,Fantastic view from 5th floor ,"What a lovely hotel. Friendly staff. Excellent rooms and veryyyy nice views of the city from the rooftop rooms on the 5th floor.

The best part of this hotel? It's location. Right across the road from the temple bar district (overrated) and book of Kells is right next door.

Places to eat: Gallagher boxty house on temple bar road. The Bank. And the hotels own restaurant isn't too bad either. ",5,2017,10,23
202,Beautiful Hotel,"Great location to walk around Dublin‚Äôs sites.  Staff friendly, foyer always smelt delightful when entering.
Room was spacious, big bathroom, all amenities provided.

Lovely bar downstairs, The Mint.
Would stay there again.",5,2017,10,21
202,Good Location.,"The hotel is in a great location, and means that you could walk to most places ( we did get a taxi for 10 euros to the Guiness Storehouse though). Rooms were modern and well equiped, and we wanted for nothing during our stay. Check in was smooth ( we were in our room by 12pm) and the breakfast was nice.

I do believe the customer service let the hotel down, during Hurrican Ophelia when unfortunately we were unsure when we would get home, post cancelled flights, and we asked for some flexibility. The flexibility wasn't there and we ended up paying over ¬£300 for a room that we only used for 6 hours ( until 6pm as we were lucky enough to get home on later flights), we had no choice to take the ""stress"" out of an already stressful situation.",4,2017,10,21
202,Good choice,"The hotel is well located and the staff quite helpful. The place is a bit long in the tooth, with need of some updates. The bed was comfortable. The room was rather dark, even with lights on. The place was clean. Overall, a good choice for location, comfort and cleanliness. ",4,2017,10,20
202,Nice Hotel in a Great Location ... where Membership Reward Status Seems Irrelevant,"The Westin Dublin is an attractive, well-managed hotel in a desirable, central location.  It is has a nice, classic decor, a prompt and well-trained staff, and excellent amenities.  It is very close to Trinity College, Temple Bar, and the River Liffey.  You can quickly get to anywhere in Dublin from here, and most of the interesting spots are well within walking distance.  I would have given the Westin Dublin five stars but we felt that they didn't give us the service or upgrade we should have received.  Specifically, we have Platinum status with SPG and Marriott, and we made the reservations nearly 6 months before the trip using quite a few membership rewards points.  They placed us in a room with two double beds down a labyrinthine maze well beyond the remote fitness center on the first floor.  The room was spacious and comfortable with a nice bath, but I expected better based on the platinum reward status that took me a long time to reach and maintain.  When I asked for better, the girl at the front desk who checked us in declined my request.  Although I'm disappointed, the Westin Dublin is still a very nice hotel in an excellent location with great amenities and a professional staff.  It still gets four stars, although SPG/Marriott Rewards members might want to prepare themselves for some resistance if they are expecting their membership status to enhance their stay.",4,2017,10,19
202,Excellent hotel,"I had a terrific stay at the Westin in Dublin.  Close to temple bar area and next to Trinity College.  I was there the day of Hurricane Ophelia and they extended my stay one additional day because all flights were cancelled.  Would highly recommend and would definitely stay here again. 
",5,2017,10,17
202,High End Dublin,"The staff and the location are the highpoints of this property but it comes at a price. Directly across from airport bus shuttle stop and Fleet Street where all the tourist bars are, the room, drink and food prices are high. But at least you are treated like the high paying customer that your are. Breakfast is good but again, 20 Euro is a lot of money for eggs. They do have a very nice bar on property with great entertainment but again, really high drink prices. Was not all that impressed with the two double bed room I was given since I was told there was a wedding that weekend and all the single bed rooms were taken, so I guess my 500 Euro a night did not qualify. But if you don't mind spending a lot of money to be treated like valued guest, then this is the place for you.",4,2017,10,16
202,3 nights in Dublin,This Westin is a beautiful old building.  The staff is very attentive and the rooms are very large in European standards.  We especially liked that it is centrally located.  We felt extremely safe when we walked out late at night.  We took the bus from the airport because the bus stop is so close to the hotel.,5,2017,10,15
202,Very Nice Hotel,"First time staying here. Very nice welcome. Good comfortable and quiet room. Very nice bathroom. Enjoyed my breakfast. The mezzanine bar/lounge looked most attractive. Great idea to be able to hire gym wear, if required.",4,2017,10,15
202,"Nice central hotel, but expensive","I stayed at the Westin Dublin after leaving my apartment ahead to my move to London. I booked it on points, and as such I have not been given any particular upgrade, despite being SPG Gold with the chain.

The room I was assigned was nevertheless pretty nice, despite being on the smaller size for a Westin. It overlooked a fake courtyard in the centre of the hotel, which is the hotel restaurant lounge, which made it a bit more noisy than I expected, but since the service stops at midnight, it does not persist all night. The curtains almost manage to keep the room dark from the lights of the lounge.

The bathroom was not particularly big, but came with both a bath tub and a walk in shower. The shower had enough pressure to take a good shower, except the drain couldn't keep up with the flow (not an uncommon problem in Dublin), making long showers not a particularly pleasant experience. Even though I reported at front desk during my stay, it was not fixed before I left.

The amenities of the room left a bit to be desired. While water was provided throughout the stay, the minibar almost only carried alcoholic beverages. No chocolate in any form was provided, and the only snack that I could find was a box of cheese and onion Pringles. Which was a bit awkward for me with a sugar low, because the kitchen also closes at midnight.

The Mint Bar, in the basement of the hotel, is quite nice, and in addition to a long list of alcoholic beverages, it includes a number of mocktails. Even though not on the menu, the bar does not refrain from making virgin mojitos, which are particularly nice, given the fresh mint. Interesting, unlike many other Westin properties I stayed at before, the bar is unable to provide SPG points when not charging the room, but it recognizes SPG Gold cards for discount even when not staying at the hotel.

The location of the hotel is particularly central, which make it easy to walk anywhere, although it makes it hard to get taxis quickly, as the new light rail work is making it hard for the drivers to pull up directly in front of the hotel.",3,2017,10,14
202,Fantastic Location ,"Located in the city center this Westin is a gem.  Just across the street from the main bar/restaurant neighborhood of Temple Bar.  
The rooms are very spacious and the acoustics are great.  Only noise heard was a door or two close shut as the early travelers departed. 
We did not taste the food here, but the basement bar has some of the best cocktails I have ever tasted. Go for the smoky Manhattan. 
Front desk staff was great. ",5,2017,10,13
202,LOCATION and LUXURY,"We were so pleased with our stay at the Westin. It is exactly in the middle of everything without all the noise! Staff was very accommodating, courteous, and timely. Our suite was very generously laid out, the bed was comfortable and warm, and the pillows were soft and pliable. The bathroom looked like it could use a renovation, but it was immaculately clean and appointed. 

The concierge was very helpful in whatever we required. We did try to book an in-room massage, but the company was fully booked for the weekend. Make sure to book in advance! We do wish they had on-site spa services.

We had drinks in the evening, and breakfast later the next day in the beautiful atrium. Any concerns we had about our food was promptly addressed. We also had drinks and a cheese plate in the cocktail bar on the lower level. The drinks were large and crazy good, but very pricey (13 euro for one drink). The ambiance was nice and the service was great.",5,2017,10,12
202,Great Stay!,Stayed here for 4 nights while visiting Dublin.  Hotel was in an excellent location for us.  Close enough to walk to a lot of the local attractions and just a 2 minute walk to Temple Bar where there were plenty of good restaurants and pubs in the evening after a long day of touring.  Would definitely stay again.,5,2017,10,11
202,City stay in Dublin,"We had a perfect Spring break in Dublin, it was a perfect hotel for the city centre and close to University for the visit to Book of keil. Was a superb buffet breakfast although not well staffed. We had the Beckett room, comfortable and with access to a roof terrace. Spectacular views. Mainly ate out but quick food options available in the hotel. We would recommend as the staff were very friendly and amenable. ",4,2017,10,11
202,5 Stat in every way,Th Westin Dublin has the best hotel location in the city.  Marvelous restoration of a beautiful old bank building.  Entire staff went above and beyond to make time there memorable.  Restaurant and bar were great.  Definitely a 5 star property.,5,2017,10,08
202,wonderful hotel and great location,"We stayed here for our first night in Ireland. They were able to check us in around noon and the location is very central, steps from Trinity College. Our room was spacious and clean and decorated/designed (i.e. the fixtures and decor) with a lot of character, not like a sterile, modern hotel. Of course, they have the wonderful heavenly bed and accommodating service of a Westin.",5,2017,10,03
202,Lovely hotel in a great location,"We stayed here 5 night following a trip to the Scottish Highlands and I've never been so happy to sleep on a Heavenly Bed after 3 nights of charming but not so comfortable beds in small inns! We had booked a king bed and initially was disappointed when the front desk clerk informed us they didn't have a king room available for our entire stay but had a spacious queen room reserved for us instead. The room size and bath were well worth the trade-off for a queen bed! We had a pretty view overlooking Trinity College and although the room size was a bit quirky, it was indeed large and very comfortable. The bath was enormous; all marble with a large separate tub, large shower and plenty of space for personal items.

Overall, this was a beautiful property with friendly, helpful staff. It was within walking distance of everything we wanted to see: Dublin Castle, Guinness Storehouse, Trinity College, The national Museum, St. Stephen's Green, shopping, dining, and pubs.",5,2017,10,02
202,outstanding in every way,"I stayed two nights at this Westin hotel.I arrived at the hotel in the morning before check-in time. The front desk staff did an outstanding job of guiding my husband and I to sites around town, places to eat and holding our luggage until our room was ready. The staff sent me a text when the room was accessible. It was wonderfully appointed. I was delighted to see they gave you a small bottle of essential oils for a relaxing night's sleep. The hotel is in a prime location to get to all areas of the city by walking or other transportation. Grafton street is around the corner, as well as Trinity Library. Temple bar area is across the street. The Aircoach for the airport drops you off right in front of the hotel. The doorman even offered up umbrellas on the day it rained. I bought a Gin and Tonic voucher from the Mint bar in the hotel. The G&T were divine; and the Mint bar was a hopping place. The hotel even had a NB program to rent gym shoes and workout clothes for 5E a day. My husband and I stayed in various places throughout our two weeks in Ireland; but the breakfast at the Moreland restaurant in the hotel was the best! They served a variety of pastries, home made smoothies, amazing local yogurt parfaits, eggs, bacon, blood pudding, fresh fruit and delicious coffee. I will go back there for sure. I am someone who travels often and have high expectations for my hotels. The Westin met and exceeded them all.",5,2017,10,02
202,Great location!,"We loved it.  Great location.  Breakfast was terrific.  The bar was great for afternoon cocktails and snacks and some Irish coffee.  We loved it and again, great location!  We had 3 rooms for 2 days and everyone enjoyed themselves here.",5,2017,10,01
202,The place to stay!,"We have stayed at the Westin Dublin a couple of times. It is right in the city center. Easy walking distance to many highlights in Dublin. Very comfortable accommodations, beautifully decorated, delicious breakfast buffet, new restaurant Morelands is great.
   Everyone working at the Westin Dublin is so helpful. We especially are appreciative to Bala the Night Manager for going the extra mile to make sure everything was perfect for our stay, which was part of our anniversary trip. 
   Thanks to all working at this exceptional hotel!",5,2017,10,01
202,Fabulous in every way.,"An exceptional hotel in every way.  Wonderful central location and a staff that goes out of their way. Public areas were spacious and comfortable.  We were upgraded to a 1 bedroom suite which was very hot with AC that didn't work properly so Joseph gave us the Presidential Suite!!  Joseph was exceptional!  Professional, kind, efficient, always anxious to give us whatever we needed!!  Excellent staff!!  Highly recommended!!",5,2017,09,27
202,Ireland vacay,5 stars! Best breakfast buffet of our trip. Alan the doorman extraordinary helpful as were all the people we delt with at this hotel.  Concierge made reservations helped plan our trips. Hotel recommend without reservation. ,5,2017,09,26
202,Great Location,"Wonderful hotel with a fabulous location. Dublin is a very walkable city and the Westin is the place to be to see all the city has to offer.  It is across from Trinity College and the Book of Kells and only about a 15 minute walk to St Patrick Cathedral, Dublin Castle and great restaurants and pubs.",5,2017,09,25
202,Tale of two visits,"Overview: great location, concierge was helpful, rooms are nice, the mint bar is fantastic, the overall service is hit or miss, atrium lounge is average (food and service). I recommend the property, but if it's busy you might not have the best service.

We stayed at this property two times in September, bookending a longer vacation. The two experiences were worlds apart. First the not-so-great: we stayed for three nights and the staff was clearly overworked and/or overwhelmed. It was the hurling finals one of the days, so I understand the business, but in general the people at the check in desk and Atrium Lounge were not very friendly. After the second day not getting our room serviced, I inquired at the desk to see if there was a schedule the property adhered to rather than an everyday thing. The front desk person looked up our room and told us that we had signed up for the ""green"" option so our room wasn't being cleaned. This was strange as neither of us even knew what it was and weren't sure we got signed up. It was an easy correction, but again the staff seemed irritated by our inquiries. Upon check out, we had some time before leaving and we asked if we could have them hold our bags for an hour. They graciously agreed, but we stood off to the side and watched for 15 minutes as our bags were moved to the middle of the lobby and left unattended (there were only 2 other people waiting to check in at that time so it wasn't overly busy). We finally retrieved our bags (which no one noticed) and brought them directly to the concierge who put them in a locked back room. 

A week later, we stayed one night before catching a flight out of the country and the experience was wonderfully different. The staff was polite, helpful, friendly, and took time to ask about our travel plans and made a note that we would be leaving early in the morning so our car would be waiting (the valet must part a few blocks away).",3,2017,09,25
202,Great Location,"My Wife and i stayed in this hotel for just the one night but well worth it, lovely room overlooking Westmoreland street, even though we were on the 4th floor a bit noisy late at night, but then again we were in the centre of the capital! so some noise is expected, but this didn't spoil our stay. Great location for visiting place as you really are in the centre.
Bar (The Mint Bar) in the basement was lovely with great drinks but when we returned later that night we found the band there extremely loud for a small venue, especially when you wanted to chat.
Breakfast was excellent, but disappointing that there were not toilet facilities close by the restaurant as a wheelchair user i found this frustrating.
All the staff we encountered were more then helpful, we would be delighted to return and stay at the hotel",4,2017,09,25
202,5 STARS,"I had the pleasure of staying here recently for one night and wish it had been for more.

On arrival our we were met and the luggage was lifted out of our car before being taken away to be parked for us. Then when we walked through the front door our luggage was taken forms again to the reception area. We were slightly early for our room to be ready but this did not stop the receptionist completing our booking in procedure and then contacting us later in the afternoon when our room was ready.

Our room was well equipped with everything you would expect and room service calling in the early evening to offer a bucket of ice for drinks was unexpected.

The location of the hotel is excellent and is only a few minutes walk from Grafton St, O'Connel St and Temple Bar.

Dinner for us was in the restaurant and was an excellent selection of fine foods and wine. The waiting staff were fantastic and were very attentive without being intrusive.

Overall this hotel is one of the best we have stayed in for customer service and luxury and we will definitely be visiting here again.",5,2017,09,24
202,Great location and wonderful hotel,"Stayed at the Westin beginning and end of our trip to Ireland. 
Upon our return to the Westin, the staff remembered and welcome us back. 
Great breakfast. 
Staff very friendly (a heartwarming trait of most Irish) and helpful. 
Recommend this place as its centrally located. Only a couple of blocks to the famous Trinity College and Temple Bar.",5,2017,09,22
202,"Hotel, Dublin","We stayed here a few years ago, in 2013, and for one night this year at the end of August. My spouse stays at Starwood properties on business frequently and we were upgraded to the Samuel Beckett suite upon arrival - a very pleasant surprise. 

The hotel is in a great, central location close to Trinity College and the temple bar area (if that's your thing). There's a lot of construction going on in the surrounding streets due to the Luas (streetcar) extension. Although our room faced the main street we had no noise issues beyond those you'd expect in the center of a city.

The hotel staff were professional and courteous. My spouse enjoyed breakfast on the mezzanine and remarked how beautiful that space is. We met up with several family members and spent a couple of hours in the basement bar. Staff there were very accommodating despite a hyperactive toddler running amok. 

The concierge gave us a dinner recommendation we were initially unsure of but when we got there were reassured we had been advised very well.  

Overall a enjoyable stay, made much better by the upgrade. Would stay there again.",5,2017,09,22
202,Perfect location,"The best location in Dublin. Old hotel with nice old style interior if you appreciate history. The staff are nice and accommodating. Nice breakfast place. Get higher floors as the main street is noisy!!!! All night long. Trash trucks, deliveries, etc.",4,2017,09,20
202,Excellent location!!,"Very classic hotel in the heart of Dublin. The location was excellent , everything in walking distance or the bus stop is just out the door. We took the bus to and from the Dublin airport, and took the train to Howth.",5,2017,09,14
202,Can't get a better location!,"Second trip to Dublin.  Stayed at an adequate Jury's the first time at about half the price but the additional cost at the Westin was worth it for a short stay.  Service excellent.  Very good breakfast.  Room well kept and quiet.  location perfect.  Just south of River Liffey with a couple of blocks of major sights like Trinity college, Book of Kells, Temple Bar, Art and Natural History Museums, Merrion and St. Stephen's beautiful parks.  All walkable.",5,2017,09,14
202,The westin,This hotel is top of the line for Dublin. The location and views are awesome. The service is impeccable. The concierge was full of knowledge of the city sights and history. He gave us tips on what to see and where to go. Very pleased with the excellent service,5,2017,09,12
202,Location at a price,"A hotel's stars, and its price set expectations. 5 stars is a bit intangible-does anyone really know, country by country the difference between 4 and 5 stars? ¬£400 a night does raise expectations and, aside from an undeniably near perfect location, the Westin doesn't really deliver. 

Specific concerns included cleaning, the room smelt musty and, even after a linen change, continued to do so. The previous occupant's snacks in the minibar was an oversight.

The room was reasonably sized, the beds comfortable and the bathroom well equipped.

No breakfast included at the price was a surprise. The atrium caf√© somewhat overpriced.

The ""save the planet"" (tiny refund for no cleaning) deal is pointless, you get the price of the coffee which you don't get replaced in the room.

There is a small gym.

Conclusion, great location and well worth ¬£200 B&B - if only....",3,2017,09,11
202,Great stay at The Westin!,"I booked The Westin Dublin via SPG points for a free night after arriving in Dublin. What a fabulous property! The check-in process was smooth, and we were able to get a room immediately even though we arrived early (around 10:30am). We took advantage of the afternoon tea via a pre-booked reservation, and I longed for the mojito teapot but refrained since we were following it up with a visit to the Guinness Storehouse. The selections in the traditional tea were simply delicious. I wish a sweet or two were swapped with savory, but the taste and presentation were wonderful.

Our room did not have any street noise, and it was very centrally located for all of the sites (or a short cab ride away from the helpful concierge). We did have to walk quite awhile to get to our room in tunneled hallways, but it wasn't much of a bother.

The bed didn't seem to be typical Heavenly brand (I've been to enough Westin properties to know), but it was okay. Down pillows were provided - wish there was an alternate poly-fill available in the closet. Power never worked in our UK outlets (TV didn't work, either), but the US outlet was perfect for our needs. I'd definitely return, but only on points! The regular room rates are pretty high.",5,2017,09,11
202,Great location,"We arrived on a Saturday when the entire ground floor was a chaotic jumble of people and luggage as some tour groups were leaving while others were arriving. When we got to the desk we were informed that our reservation had been cancelled two weeks earlier, although it was never revealed how that supposedly happened. After a fretful hour we were told they had found a room for us, but it turned out to be very small and lacking a window with only a small skylight near the top of the wall. Eventually we were shown to a large double room facing a quiet side street. 

The best thing about the Dublin Westin is its great central location, which other reviewers have already mentioned. It doesn‚Äôt exactly exude character or charm, but has more of a crisp, sterile, corporate feel to it. It is very clean, and service is very good even if a bit impersonal. Breakfast in the Morelands Grill was very good, and on our second night we had dinner there as well which was excellent.",4,2017,09,11
202,Great city hotel with a central location,Spent 4 nights here with the family on our first trip to Dublin. The location was perfect for access to most all the sights in central Dublin. Across the street from Trinity University and 2 blocks away from Grafton Street. Many restaurants and pubs within a very short walking distance. Hotel atrium has a great afternoon tea service as well as a good bar in the basement. Rooms are modern and service was great. Looking forward to a return stay.,4,2017,09,10
202,Wonderful hotel but experienced a couple of issues,"I would have liked to give a 5-star rating except for 2 hiccups which mattered.  The hotel is in a good location and is luxuriously decorated.  We stayed for 2 nights and then returned from a west coast trip and stayed another 3 days.  I booked a deluxe room for the first stay and everything was perfect.  Room was quiet & comfortable.  Reception and concierge were efficient and helpful.  When we returned, I had booked a classic entry room and they gave us an upgrade and prepared some goodies and a bottle of wine to celebrate my birthday.  That was very nice and thoughtful of them.  The room was very nice and quiet.  However, I noticed the basin was not very clean when I checked in but it was late and I decided to have housekeeping do their cleaning the next day.  I took photo of the dirty basin, even used a tissue to partly wipe it to see the dirt can be removed.  I show the photos to the reception the next day & ask them to alert housekeeping. After our room was made, the basin was still dirty.  So, I called housekeeping directly and requested immediate cleaning.  Finally, it was cleaned.  (Photos attached).  Another incident happened - our day tour was picking us up at the hotel and the tour guide went up to the reception to ask for us but the receptionist said we are not registered as guests!  (I did check with the guide that he got my family name correct).  Eventually the tour guide saw us waiting at the hotel's entrance and asked us our names.  As we were checking out the next day, I didn't want to make a fuss about it.  I think the hotel is very nice, staff are efficient, the hotel management tries to make their guests have a perfect stay but there's always room for improvement.",4,2017,09,09
202,Perfect hotel to tour Dublin,We started our tour of Ireland in Dublin and we loved everything about this hotel. All of the staff were very helpful and friendly.   we could walk to most of the sights.  the breakfast offered  wonderful with the best waffles.  Our room was nicely decorated with a large bathroom.  This is the place you want to stay if you are touring Dublin. We also enjoyed the afternoon tea in a beautiful setting in the hotel.,5,2017,09,09
202,"Great Location, Old hotel","Wife and I were here for 2 nights in August for the start of our Ireland roadtrip.

The hotel was located at a wonderful location right next to Trinity College. From the airport, the Airlink Express bus took us right around the corner from the hotel. 

Our check in process was wonderful, the lady was knowledgable and friendly. We were given a room without a view but that was quite ok. We only cared about a quiet room instead of a view.

The room was comfortable but quite old, which wasn't a problem. Just that you can see all the stains, mold-like stuff, tears of everything. Bed was comfortable and clean. Bathroom amenities has changed from green tea and white tea which is relatively the same as before. WiFi was public without a code which was concerning so I had to add an extra layer of security with the VPN but it worked great the whole time. We had 2 quiet and comfortable night sleep. We participated in the Make-a-Green-Choice program, but we haven't received the points yet, SPG customer service is taking care of it hopefully we will see it posted soon.

From the hotel we were able to walk to all the Dublin attractions. M&S Market was down the street which made it easy to purchase roadtrip snacks.

Overall it was a good stay and we will be back.",4,2017,09,08
202,Excellent location,"Our stay at the Westin Dublin was fabulous.  Room was very nice, breakfast was tasty in the morning, and staff was friendly and helpful.  But best of all was the location of this hotel - smack dab in the middle of the city across from Temple Bar!  My husband and I were able to walk everywhere from this location.",5,2017,09,05
202,Vacation,"Loved the hotel, staff very helpful and friendly. Clean and close, like real close to everywhere like across the street from Templar, near Trinity College and more...
I loved the ""Mint Bar"" at the hotel, the only thing that struck me funny was on my first night I went down to the bar with my wife and had a gin and tonic, wanted something to snack on like peanuts, well the bartender charged me 3 or 4 dollars for peanuts I thought was very odd because just about every bar I've every gone to has always given you some type of snack at the bar, well the next night I went same bar, same drink, although this time I did not ask for any peanuts but they gave them to me at no charge...this is not a big deal but at the Westin I don't really expect to pay for little things, I was afraid after to ask for extra shampoo.. But nevertheless I would go back there, it is a real nice Hotel.",5,2017,09,05
202,Awesome experience,"This hotel is centrally located near Temple Bar area pubs/restaurants, the DoDublin hop on/hop off bus tour and a Dublin visitor center office where many of the local all-day bus tours depart from.  Excellent breakfast buffet selection that also includes hot foods.  Trinity College is also within close walking distance.  Our room was clean and quite comfortable.  The large showerhead was great and it had fantastic water pressure.  We also greatly appreciated the 2 daily complimentary bottles of water - very refreshing after walking around all day!  A member of the housekeeping team knocked on our door one evening and asked if we would like a bucket of ice.  Why yes we would!  No other hotel has ever done this for us.  Nice touch!  Kenneth at the Concierge desk politely offered to call our airport transfer service when the driver was late.  Thank you Kenneth!  We will definitely stay at the Westin Dublin in the future.",5,2017,09,04
202,2 Nights end of August,We stayed at the hotel for two nights last week.  The hotel was fine.  We were booked in a room with two double beds.  We were able to check in a little early which was nice as we were traveling in same day.,4,2017,09,02
202,Luxury and location ,"What more could you want when you treat yourself to luxury on a holiday.  From the professional and friendly doormen and reception desk staff , you know that the SPG quality prevails.  Perfectly appointed rooms with great heavenly beds and large bathrooms are the standard.  Within steps of the Temple Bar entertainment district and the shopping down the street , you can  enjoy Dublin ",5,2017,09,01
202,"Great Location, Cosy & Comfortable","I stayed at the Westin, Dublin in December 2016 and very much enjoyed my stay. The rooms are of a good size, well looked after and perhaps had just been re-done. The breakfasts were very good and the location to get to pretty much any central location in Dublin was great!",4,2017,08,31
202,Perfect location,"The Westin is in a very Central location, next to Trinity college, opposite Temple Bar, near the river and the main bridge to cross to the other side and just down the road from grafton street.

The rooms were luxury, very posh. Our room had no external windows, only internal over the atrium. This limited the amount of light in the room as even with a skylight the atrium it wasn't well lit and also meant we were uncomfortable opening the curtains. When I went to leave the hotel I actually popped down and stood outside the front entrance to see what the weather was like as I had no idea otherwise which is a bizarre concept. No windows in the corridors either. 

I had a fantastic nights sleep, very comfortable bed and duvet and great a/c which made the room freezing! Had to adjust it to get a comfy temperature but fab ac. Better than being too hot and uncomfortable on a hot July night.

There is a bus stop right opposite the hotel to go to the airport - buses run frequently, I got the airbus coach, it took 35 mins and cost 7E. Although there are other buses also but these may stop at a lot more stops I imagine and take longer. Otherwise I was advised that a taxi costs about 30‚Ç¨. 

The gym was very small but there was only one other person when I visited so it was good enough for me. Also the hotel provides a service where for only 5‚Ç¨ you get a gym kit to use, I didn't use this service but was very impressed as my gym kit (especially trainers) always takes up extra space in my suitcase and space is precious when you travel with only carry on.",5,2017,08,29
202,"convenient, comfortable, and great little touches","This is a great spot to stay in Dublin. The extra touches like the Westin's heavenly bedding, aromatherapy, and black out shades really make a difference in getting over jet lag. Room size was quite decent for a hotel in the city. Breakfast was nice, you can get eggs cooked to order. The location cannot be beat, easy 10 min walk to just about everything.",5,2017,08,29
202,A Lovely Hotel,A really nice quality hotel in a perfect location. We did change rooms from a matchbox to a decent sized room which made the stay more pleasant. Excellent breakfast with multiple choices. Professional and helpful staff. Highly recommended.,5,2017,08,29
202,Don't bother,"The westin Dublin is supposed to be a top rated hotel , If you are using point don't bother, ou get treated like a second class citizen. We we told when we checked in ad tried to make sure one of the rooms was a double, sorr there are none when you use points . (Even though we had made the reservation well in advance) Another room had a roof smack up against the window, great view huh. Lastly we were told they offered a special price on the buffet breakfast, but you need to purchase it for all the days of your stay, no thanks!  Will not return to the Westin and would not recommend it.",2,2017,08,29
202,Afternoon Tea,"The Atrium Lounge in the Westin Hotel is a must for afternoon tea. Lovely setting with a high glass roof and small lounge so it's got a cosy feel. I would recommend the Peculiar Tea a very different option with gin, mint and lime in a teapot instead of tea. My companion had the regular afternoon tea and both were excellent. Young female waitresses were so helpful and the service was excellent. ",5,2017,08,28
202,Elegance in perfect location,"The best decision you could make is to stay at The Dublin Westin. They allocated us a room that met all our  requests. Anne Marie was extra helpful and welcoming and had this ideal room ready when we arrived just before noon. In fact, all staff we encountered were helpful and considerate. An example- one day I asked the Concierge where I might purchase a highlighter pen- he just handed me his.
King- deluxe-city view is the recommended room category. Our room was on 4th floor with an iconic view of Bank of Ireland,Fleet Street and we could see down O'Connell to the spire out of our dormer window. One knew you were in the heart of Dublin by just gazing out your window. The room was spacious,with high end decor, a luxurious marble bathroom and heavenly walk in shower. Quiet inside and out.. This hotel has excellent breakfasts in Moorland's Grill  - great hot chocolate and eggs to order. Be sure to choose a room rate with breakfast..We enjoyed deliciouus light meals,cocktails and Irish coffee at The Mint Bar.
We stayed 8 nights and were delighted every day with the luxurious ambience of the hotel, the warm professional staff and perfect location.
Historic charm meets modernity- one could sit by the roaring fire while on WIFI",5,2017,08,27
202,Wonderful Hotel in the Heart of Dublin,"We were spending 1 night in Dublin and wanted a hotel that was central to the city.  The Westin Dublin is that.  The #1 attraction is Guinness brewery, so we wanted something relatively close.  And we wanted to definitely visit Trinity College, which is right across the street.  I am also an SPG Gold Member, so if I can possibly pick a Starwood property, I do.  The Westin Dublin was truly great.  First of all, the staff, from doormen, to bell, to concierge to front desk were the friendliest staff we have met in a long time! Kind, smiling, and extremely helpful.  Our room was comfortable, very clean, and had a great view.  The central location made it a breeze to walk almost everywhere, although Guinness was a healthy 45 minute walk! When, not IF we ever go back to Dublin for a longer visit, we will definitely be booking at the Westin Dublin!",5,2017,08,26
202,3 nights,Lovely hotel and wonderful location.  One problem - we added breakfast to our room at check in for 3 days.  When I found that we would need to leave for the airport by 6:45 on the third day I asked to have the breakfast cost of 34Eur removed from my bill for that morning. I made this request on the second day.  I was told that the breakfast cost could not be removed once it was added.  I would suggested that if you have an early flight you might want to skip adding breakfast.  That keeps me from giving a 5 star rating.,4,2017,08,26
202,Visiting Dublin!,Very nice hotel. I got a view of Trinity College. Great service.  Very close to Grafton street for shopping and dinning.  Plus across of Trinity College and the Book of Kells. Close to the bus line also and walking distance to many great sites. ,4,2017,08,26
202,Great Hotel in Dublin,We stayed in Dublin for one night last week and cannot say enough about how wonderful this hotel was.  Everyone we encountered was extremely friendly and helpful.  We had breakfast and dinner at Morelands Grill and the food was unbelievable.  It was my daughter's birthday and she was given a gift of Ireland from the staff that made her day!  Would highly recommend.,5,2017,08,25
202,Best hotel in town,"I stay at the Westin every time it is my favorite hotel. Great location,nice and clean rooms very comfortable also and the staff are extremely helpful.i like the atrium lounge  they always have a very welcoming smile",5,2017,08,24
202,Gorgeous ,"The Westin in Dublin is a gorgeous and luxurious little village of its own in the middle of Dublin. Comfortable beds, gorgeous rooms (there are a couple of different options), good food, and close by to everything in Dublin. The breakfast could have a bit more options but still good. The staff is amazing, super helpful and kind. They even made a special tea from fresh ginger for us when some of us got a cold. You will not regret staying here. It would be my nr 1 option when staying in Dublin again.",5,2017,08,24
202,Made family vacation memorable!,Our first time visit to Ireland and we just loved it!  Part of the reason for such a fabulous trip was our interaction with the locals.  All of the Irish people we met were friendly and very accommodating.  Our first stop was Dublin and the Westin Dublin definitely made a great first impression!  We noticed at check-in a double booking problem and,5,2017,08,24
202,Great hotel.  Will stay here again next time in Dublin,"Even though we only stayed here 1 night, due to a planned 18 hour lay over on the way back home, it was a great hotel.
It has a fantastic lobby and the rooms were nice, bit and well appointed.  The bathroom was also nice and large.  The bed was very comfortable.
The staff was very friendly and attentive. In fact all Irish people we met were super friendly.
The only negative thing I have about the hotel is that our TV did not work and the service person that came to inspect it was not able to fix it.  The hotel's staff was very apologetic and asked us what they could do to make it up.  I hold nothing against The Westin for this.  Sometimes things just break down.

I cant wait to go back to Ireland and definitely stay at The Westin.",5,2017,08,23
202,Beautiful hotel,I enjoyed my stay here. Lobby entrance is beautiful as so the hotel itself. The room was big and always cleaned. Receptionists are very helpful when you need something. I would totally recommend and stay here if I ever come back. ,5,2017,08,23
202,Afternoon tea below average,"The atmosphere was nice, mostly thanks to the 5 stars ambiance. 
The food was average. Although abundant some of the sandwiches were very bland, without any particular flavor coming through. The panna cotta itself was delicious but the morello puree was overpowering (I understand that morello cherry are a bit bitter I would probably think that less of it would be helpful). Lastly the chocolate and hazelnut torte was impossible to get form the tray and to eat as a result of the bottom being too soft while the chocolate part on top was too hard - as a result being squashed when digging with the spoon in it. On the other hand the goat cheese in the wafer basket, the scone and the macaroon were particularly good.
Lastly the service was quite disappointing - apart from the door staff member. I was not made aware of the fact that the table was only going to be reserved for 2 hours as not even mentioned on the confirmation email, one assistant came to the table asking us to leave although we actually only had the table for 1 and a half hour (she then came back when the 2 hours were up). This aside, which could be a mere misunderstanding even if very uncomfortable, the rest of the service was still unsatisfactory. 
I do like afternoon tea as a ritual but, since it is not not something that I indulge in too often, I would definitely opt to go somewhere in the future.",2,2017,08,23
202,A most memorable stay!,"A gem of a hotel and a proud representative of the Starwood brand The Westin Dublin sits prominently in the capital‚Äôs city centre. With easy access via the Airport Coach just across the street there are loads of shops nearby and just a stone‚Äôs throw from the Liffey.

Many thanks to Minna at the front desk for coordinating a special request which made celebrating a special occasion that much better!

Rooms are large and as expected from a Westin as you settle in for the night into the crisp, fresh linens. Washrooms are clean and bright with the amenities that are perfect for a comfortable stay.

Highly recommended and due to the associates‚Äô anticipating almost every need will not hesitate to return to this property the next time in Ireland.",5,2017,08,21
202,My go-to hotel in Dublin,"This is the second time I've stayed at the Westin Dublin and it was an excellent stay. Visited as part of a trip to Scotland/Northern Ireland/Ireland, Dublin was our last stop. We were upgraded to the two story Samuel Beckett suite with an adjoining room for our friends. Had a great balcony that overlooked Westmoreland Street. Tons of space in the room, the bathroom was enormous, and the staff was excellent as always. Breakfast was ok (free since I'm SPG platinum), but I don't know if I'd pay for it. Bar prices were not outrageous, but not inexpensive. Location is great, and is walk-able to many of the Dublin sites. Will 100% stay here again, and will recommend it wholeheartedly to friends traveling to the area.",5,2017,08,21
202,The best!,"The staff was so kind and attentive, the food was outstanding I had the afternoon tea which is to die forüòç, and the surroundings were gorgeous, went for a birthday treat with family July 3rd and honestly it made it even more amazing üëåüèº‚òïÔ∏è",5,2017,08,20
202,Free breakfast but they¬¥ll make you pay for eggs (??),Big shock for breakfast: on the buffet we saw the scrambled eggs which looked old and asked if we could have eggs prepared for us. They said yes but when we were leaving they told us there was a charge for omelets!!  Our breakfast was included and we were told it¬¥d be free.A unpleasant surprise in a hotel which is not one of the best Westins I¬¥ve visited.,3,2017,08,20
202,Family Trip Ireland & Scotland ,"Went down to their Business Center to respond to my emails and update my business calendar. Extremely disappointed that Browser settings were so out of date that even logon to the most basic cloud services was impossible.

Even more disappointing was the total lack of interest shown by the staff. This service is extremely important to those of us on holidays who don't want to lug a laptop around. The fix is so simple.",3,2017,08,18
202,central location,"Let me start off by saying we are gold members, so we get ""free upgrades"""", however for a suite we had to pay 30euros for our upgrade.... after the front desk staff had to talk to her boss when we questioned this, we weren't granted the free upgrade.  She gave us two options, a room with a king bed and view or a suite with a queen bed. we opted for the suite.  What I learned is all the rooms are different shapes and sizes, no suite is alike. the suite was a good size for us, however the view was of the Atrium lounge.  We included breakfast for about 17euros each, it was good. mostly breads, fruit, granola, yogurts, scrambled eggs, but you can order pancakes, waffles and eggs to order as well. 
The staff were very helpful, friendly, and accommodating especially the man at the concierge desk. He recommended two great restaurants to us, one had a wait but very worth it. They give you an umbrella if you ask for it as well. the gym is very small, 3 treadmills. Housekeeping was decent, however when we came back to our room, I found  tea bag I had used on the floor (gross), and several other items that should have been discarded by them (lack of attention to detail).  Also during turn down service one evening, I had used a tea cup, and it was left there, it wasn't refreshed or taken away.  I felt it was a very quiet room which we appreciated. The westin fit program was pretty good as well. for 5 Euros you get short, t shirt, socks and shoes, and you can get a new pair the next day for just the one charge. Less laundry we have to do later. 
They do make amazing drinks in the Mint bar, so its worth a visit. Location wise its great, very close to a lot of the main attractions, temple bar is right there, St. Patricks isn't  a far walk either.",4,2017,08,17
202,Great place to stay in Dublin,"Recently, I stayed at the Westin Dublin. I have to say it is probably one of the best hotels in Dublin. It is located in the very center of Dublin, about 40 ft from Temple Bar and all of the night life. The rooms are very nice and comfortable. The Westin offers elite service and a very good concierge. They have a great bar, gym, and restaurant all in the hotel. The restaurant was outstanding. The only issue we had was getting transportation to and from the hotel if needed. Make sure if you need a cab for a large group of people you call down to the bell men ahead of time. The hotel staff and employees were all very friendly and kind during my stay. The Westin Dublin is a very nice hotel. I also have to add that the concierge and bell men were very friendly and were always willing to help. ",5,2017,08,16
202,Good but not great!,"Love location! Room  ready when arrived early.  Concierge helpful!  Breakfast average, don't bother to include it.  Room far from elevator and not large!  Location is excellent!  Room attendants always had room ready when retry from day's p√≠o get,",4,2017,08,16
202,First class,"Lovely hotel, situated in the heart of Dublin. Staff very helpful, courteous, nothing too much trouble. Breakfast is delicious. Rooms are very well appointed, towels and toiletries changed and replenished every day.

The Mint bar is very nice. Afternoon tea In the Atrium is a must.

Highly recommend this hotel.",5,2017,08,14
202,Great Stay,"Excellent experience! Very friendly staff and lovely, clean room with a fantastic dublin location made for a very enjoyable stay at the Westin. I would definitely recommend this hotel and I intend on staying here again in the near future.",5,2017,08,13
202,"Very nice hotel, perfect location","Spent 5 nights here in August with my family. Although our rooms weren't ready when we arrived (we arrived in the morning), they were kind enough to call me on my cell phone when it was ready. They also found us two rooms side by side which was helpful.  
The location of the hotel is perfect -- everything is so close. Trinity College and Bank of Ireland right across the street, Temple Bar across the street in another direction, and the River Liffey and its sights right up the road. Very helpful front desk and concierge, who helped us confirm train schedules to Kilkenny.  All in all, we'd stay here again on a return trip to Dublin and recommend it to others.",4,2017,08,13
202,Staying at the Westin Dublin,My stay was a very pleasant one and the staff were very professional and friendly  Hotel was very clean apart from the bathroom tub started to back up on second day but a call to the front desk was made and the problem was fixed The breakfast was great  The workers at the congseirge was awsome,5,2017,08,10
202,"Great Experience, Staff & Location","What an absolute top notch staff. We wrapped up a two week trip at Dublin Westin with previous stops in Paris (Westin Vendome) and Maldives (St. Regis) and couldn't say enough good things about the hotel and staff. First, the location is as good as it gets, next to trinity college and very short walk to temple bar area. The great experience started long before our arrival when I received an email from Tracy asking for our arrival details and if anything could be done to make our stay better. Once we arrived, the girl checking us in (didn't catch name after long flight) couldn't have been more polite and helpful. We also received a very nice hand written note from Maggie (asst manager) during our stay. Our stay at the Westin couldn't have been any better and wouldn't stay anywhere else on future trips to Dublin.",5,2017,08,07
202,Perfect location ,"Perfect location, few steps from Trinity College and across the street from Temple Bar. Beautiful facilities and very comfortable rooms.  The restaurant was fantastic and service exceptional. All expectations met as a Westin property ",5,2017,08,05
202,Handicapped Traveller Very Upset,"Firstly, I have to say that the hotel is very well appointed however we feel let down in many critical areas. The room was 303 euros for the night so keep that in mind the room provided had NO WINDOWS. It had a roof light and 2 very small high level daylight fan lights so in effect we were given a box. The explanation from the front desk manager was that this is a handicapped room. So the assumption from the comment is that handicapped people don't need a view. We were disturbed after 10pm by housekeeping offering a 'turn down service'. We did take this up with Mr Zhou front desk manager after our stay and he did offer to upgrade our room next time 'if available'. If not we'll have to accept the windowless box again I guess. I genuinely felt very uncomfortable about this lack of window it made me very anxious and i'm not the handicapped partner. Really upset and disappointed. Westin Gold Member and loyal to the brand no longer",1,2017,08,02
202,Excellent experience,"The hotel is situated just across the street from Trinity College, the main attraction of the city and a block from the pedestrian street where the famous Temple Bar is located. Their service is very good and the breakfast is outstanding. I definitely recommend this hotel.",5,2017,08,02
202,"Great staff, great service and lovely accommodations.","We are here on a two night stay and loved it so much we booked another night for our return trip.  The staff is truly wonderful.  From the moment we checked in we were given great service, the concierge provided two great restaurant recommendations Pinchet and Rustic Stone), both exceeded our expectations.

The room is clean, well appointed, quiet and there is a beautiful view of the city from our windows.

The Mint (bar) was a nice surprise--great wine selections and appetizers.

I highly recommend the Westin, not only for the local, but more importantly for the outstanding service and accommodations.

Can't wait to return next Saturday.",5,2017,07,31
202,Pricey but terrific,"This is the second time we have stayed in the Westin Dublin.  While we do not travel extensively, this is certainly the loveliest hotel we have stayed in anywhere.  The staff are so gracious.  No detail is too trivial.  We felt welcomed and taken care of.  The breakfast included in our room rate was hearty and delicious.  We were treated to a complimentary bottle of wine and platter of local cheeses on our arrival.  I traveled with a family of 4 (two children age 10 and 12).  The junior suite was very spacious (room 437) and the hotel kindly gave us a rollaway and an air mattress.  

Yes, it is a pricey stay.  But the location in the heart of Dublin and the exceptional service by all of the staff make this worth the expense.  I can't think of a reason to stay anywhere else in Dublin.",5,2017,07,30
202,Staff Run Amok......Avoid!,"Used to be when you were in Dublin the staff were extremely pleasant. Well at this hotel the staff act like KGB officials and are very rude. They were intentionally rude to my highly educated daughter and I am a Lifetime SPG Platinum meaning I have spent over 1,000+ nights on the road in SPG hotels. Additionally on some very hot nights the AC did not work in the room, and they put us in a tiny room all the while the staff acted like no big deal.

Well YES it is a big deal as our worldwide staff has been instructed that Westin Dublin is no longer a place they may stay at.
We VOTE with our wallets Mr. GM and as the Chairman of a worldwide conglomerate I assure you no dollars will be spent at your hotel.

Avoid this hotel much better options where the staffs are polite and respectful of a hotel guest.

the Doctor hit me with some LOVE and a helpful vote!",1,2017,07,30
202,"5 days in Dublin, Ireland @the Westin","They do a great job , service is high level and the people are very friendly. 
The breakfast is very good and will suffice for a Brunch so all you really need is dinner.
It is located near all the bars and shops so you don't have to walk far for shopping, food or entertainment.",5,2017,07,28
202,Highly recommended,"I cannot say enough good things about this hotel! My wife and I were recently honeymooning in Ireland and had the privilege of staying at the Westin Dublin for 4 nights. Not only was the hotel beautiful inside and out but so was the staff - everyone was so incredibly friendly and helpful. The location doesn't get any better either - Grafton Street shopping and restaurants were just a few blocks away, everything else was a short 10 minute walk. If possible, request a room facing the alluring Trinity College, you could get used to waking up that view every morning. Lastly, be sure to visit their in-house bar downstairs. The Mint Bar...I'm still dreaming about those cocktails. We will defiantly be back in the future!",5,2017,07,20
202,Super!,"Had the pleasure of staying at the Westin for 3 nights.  I booked using SPG points at 16,000 a night which I thought was an incredible value given that the rooms were almost ¬£500 a night.  I knew the hotel was near capacity so I was prepared to get a double standard room: however, we were upgraded to a double superior room and they included a blow-up mattress for our 5 year old at no additional charge.  

The room was a nice size and loved the marble bathroom with separate deep soaking tub and shower (although I wish there was a larger shelf in the shower).  I love old world elegance and this hotel has it in spades.  Our room faced Westmoreland Street but barely heard any street noise being that we were on the top floor.  This hotel is central to everything - we walked everywhere from the waterfront, to Temple Bar to Grafton Street.  We had the buffet breakfast every morning which wasn't too bad, but there is a Starbucks across the street and a couple of Rolling Donuts within walking distance.  Definitely have a drink at the bar downstairs - it's gorgeous and the cocktails are amazing.

There is a lot of construction in front of the hotel due to the expansion of the Light Rail but it's happening across the city, so there's no getting away from it and the noise really was non-existent.  I would not hesitate to stay here again.",5,2017,07,19
202,Home away from home,"You can't get a more central location then this hotel, everything is within 10 min walking distance from shops, parks, transport, pubs, restaurants etc. Once you step into this beautiful property staff are welcoming you with warm smiles and make you feel right at home. You forget your even in the city. 

I loved their signature white tea aroma that filled the hallways. The bedrooms are incredibly spacious and inviting, decorated in warm tones. Their Heavenly beds do not disappoint either and their waterfall shower is amazing! 

Staff went above and beyond during our stay. Had some food and drinks in the Mint Bar (highly recommend the pesto chips!) I previously enjoyed a wonderful afternoon tea here which everyone needs to experience. Staff take the very best care of you and ensure you are completely at ease by providing a personalised service. 

Breakfast is amazing, even if you are not a guest I would recommend spending your morning enjoying their buffet selection and fresh coffees. 

I was disappointed to leave as it felt like home for me but I will absolutely be back for another stay.",5,2017,07,19
202,"Ireland,Dublin",I love love Ireland. The first time I went as soon as the plane touch ground to the end of the trip. I loved everything & everything I saw was great. I have been blessed to visited Ireland twice & I would be ready to go a third time in a heartbeat.,5,2017,07,18
202,Super clean and great location,"Our room was the most spacious of all the rooms we stayed through our UK/Europe trip. The room was super quiet with two beautiful windows. The upkeep of the room was impeccably maintained and very clean! We had our room made up everyday and got new shampoos/wash each day.

It was an easy walk to Temple Bar and the city center and about a mile and a half to Guinness storehouse! Great location if you buy a hop on/off tour bus through for the city",5,2017,07,18
202,Super afternoon tea,"Had a fabulous Christmas afternoon tea here ! Beautiful setting with Christmas trees, lit fires and a real Christmas atmosphere. The afternoon tea was beautiful it presented and plentiful / drinks were topped up regularly and service was efficient warm yet unobtrusive - lovely way to spend an afternoon with friends ",5,2017,07,17
202,Never again will stay at this hotel,"We were looking for a highly rated hotel in the centre of Dublin and many people recommended Westin. At the price of over 300 per night this is what we got:
- drunk obnoxious neighbours who were falling in and out of their room slamming the doors all day and all night 
- hotel staff that offered to move us (even though we were sleeping rather than moving the drink neighbours). We checked another room which was even worse than the room we had before. It was facing inside the hotel in the bar area so windows could not be opened. So hotel's idea of helping is downgrading the room 
- elevator that smelt like two days old alcohol and made us want to throw up going into it 
- after getting no sleep, I had to get used at 7am for work 

So if you are looking for somewhere nice to stay that is professionally ran and has knowledge of hospitality, DO NOT STAY AT THIS HOTEL! 

",1,2017,07,16
202,Great location but could be better overall,"We stayed here for three nights and had a room on the top floor.  The only window in the room was like an attic window and part of the room was slanted because of the roof.  I always worried that my husband would hit the roof because he is six foot two so I slept on the side of the bed close to that wall.  We paid quite a bit on the room and in fact it is the most expensive accommodation we had during our three week drive around of Ireland.  I understand it might due to its good location but I expect a better room and better services especially housekeeping.  We were out and about really early the second day but by the time we got back at 3.30pm, our room was still not made up.  We had to leave again to Allow for the room to be made up and told the reception that our room was not made up.  Instead of apologising, the reception staff told us it was because they wouldn't want to ""kick"" guests out of their room early on Sundays (it was 3.30pm when we returned!) I rather she told the truth something like we don't have enough staff on Sundays then I would understand.  Anyway, we didn't make a fuss and just went out again.  But what greatly annoyed me was the next day when I took a shower, I found that the shampoo, conditioner and body wash were either empty or nearly empty!  They were all small tubes and they were placed neatly standing up like new so I wasn't aware that they haven't been replaced!  Otherwise I would have rung housekeeping and asked for new ones BEFORE I went into the shower! I left the used one without putting back their lids on the floor to indicate they needed to be replaced the previous day and how the housekeeping staff think a little tube can last two days for two people is beyond me.  It's not a big thing but it's these little things that makes a difference, particularly the hotel claims to be five star.  I am returning to Dublin before I fly home but have decided to stay at another hotel for that night.",3,2017,07,15
202,Wonderful Hotel in close proximity to Trinity College and Grafton Street,"We found this hotel and the staff to be remarkable.   Everyone was very interested in making sure our stay was perfect.  Although they have no ideal spot for automobiles to pull in,(as a new streetcar line is being put in right in front of their front doors)
the bell hops,doormen, and concierge were all present to help with directions and luggage. 

Our rooms were not large but adequate and not cramped.(probably bigger than most European hotels) It was odd a chair was placed next to doors that led  out to a balcony. (It was wet and cold and not particularly inviting so we did not try to use the balcony)

Breakfast was included with our tariff and it was extraordinary--both buffet and menu service. 

We would recommend this hotel and stay there again. 
",5,2017,07,14
202,"Great Hotel, Great Location","Enjoyed final 2 nights in Ireland at the Westin Dublin and very happy we did.  The facility itself is very clean and comfortable.  Staff was friendly and helpful and the included breakfast was excellent.  Location is also great.  One block to Trinity University, and one block the other way to Temple Bar area.  Also many other shopping, eating and drinking options right nearby.  Highly recommended.",4,2017,07,12
202,Good location but a disappointment overall,"The best feature of this hotel is the location.  I booked a room for one night using air miles; the description on the aeroplan website promised spacious rooms decorated in characteristic Irish decor.  I arrived at 10:30 and had to wait for a room; I was promised one in an hour or 90 minutes but no one called and three hours later I returned.  At that time I was given a tiny room that faced a busy street and a building covered in pipes.  I complained, and was shown another room that had a view of Trinity College (much better), but also was tiny.  The decor was more LA designer than Irish, with an upholstered black faux leather headboard with metal studs.  Not what I was expecting. The curtains were thin and did not entirely cover the sides of the windows, which meant that the room was not dark. The street noise was not bad, but there was sound transfer from other guest rooms.  I did not sleep well in this hotel compared with the other hotel I stayed at on arrival.

The staff were friendly enough, but when I arrived no one was at the door, and I had to pull my luggage up a ramp myself.  I noticed that the main entrance was often unattended, and when I returned to my room in the evening four young men followed me into the elevator. When I asked them what floor they were going to they just laughed. None of them had room keys and I think they were just having fun taking a ride in the elevator.  I often travel alone for business in Asia and North America; this is the first time I have had an experience like this. The Westin Dublin needs to be more responsible in protecting its guests from uncomfortable situations like this.  

I read reviews and decided against eating at the Westin.  The Westin is well-located for sight-seeing and there are many good restaurants nearby.  But I would not stay here again since I now know that there are better options.",2,2017,07,12
202,Excellent hotel in the heart of the city!,"Check in: There was a small line at check in, however it moved quite quickly. We arrived a bit before check in and we were quite delighted when the staff member advised us that our room was ready. 

Room: We had a standard room that was very nice. It was immaculate and very quiet as it faced the inner courtyard. It had all of the lovely Westin amenities and I loved the extra desk space. 

Location: This hotel is very centrally located. We did not have any problems finding places to eat or things to do. It's located very close to Trinity College which is a great place to check out. 

Staff: The staff at this hotel are so friendly! Whenever we'd be leaving the hotel to explore the city, the staff at the door would ask us if we needed any recommendations for places to eat, or things to see and I thought this touch was amazing! I really felt welcome at this hotel and it has left a lasting impression. 

Overall, I loved my stay at the Westin Dublin and will be back on future vacations to Dublin.",5,2017,07,11
202,Good location but overpriced,"This was our 2nd time staying at this property.  There was tons on construction going on at all hours which made our stay disappointing.

The location is awesome.  The property is ok and breakfast is average.  Kind of disappointed this time around.  

If you are looking to stay in the Temple Bar area....this is the hotel.",3,2017,07,11
202,One of my better holiday bookings.,"Great Hotel in a great location central for nearly all Dublin City Centre attractions , Pubs Restaurants and Shopping . The Hotel was top class from checking in to checking out . Our room was on the second floor looked like it had been recently refurbished, lovely bedroom decor and furnishing . A large bathroom with a bath and walk in shower .  The breakfast Buffett was superb with lovely Tea Coffee Juices and Smoothies. 
All staff we came across were very nice very helpful . Thanks we had a great stay .",5,2017,07,10
202,Perfect hotel,"First trip to Dublin, this hotel is perfect from start to finish. The hotel and room 340 are beautiful, The staff are second to none so helpful and friendly. The food is first class, and the room has everything to make your stay comfortable and relaxing. There are more toiletries than I have ever seen in any hotel room anywhere in the world, Which is brilliant for me. The bathrobes are not old and rough which is lovely. If you ever get the chance to stay here please do because it will make your trip here perfect. The bed is so comfy and lovely bedding. The hotel is central for everything you would possibly want to see in the city. Thankyou the westin for a fantastic trip",5,2017,07,10
202,Very good standard. In the heart of Dublin,"Stayed 4 nights on my own, on business.

The hotel is very stylish and centrally situated. Rooms are decorated in a classic style to a very high standard. Very comfy bed and good quality sleep.

Very polite staff, useful in recommending nice restaurants for dinner, or offering to book a taxi, etc. Very fast and efficient check in and check out. 

Fast and efficient room service.

Had breakfast at the hotel only once (""Full Irish""), but it was really good quality and delicious. Hot buffet scrambled eggs (which are sometimes quite disgusting at other hotel) were really tasty and fresh tasting, perfect texture. If anything it was definitely on the pricey side - 25 euros for just a couple of items (it counted as ""Full Irish"" because I had some hot items).",4,2017,07,09
202,Room never ready,"This is our second time in 10 days at Westin Dublin . Both times.... and we sit in lobby and hear guest after guest.... the rooms are never ready. The line  is ""check in is 3pm"" . We stayed at 5 other hotels in Ireland so far and our room was always ready when we checked in. Is this the culture of westin dublin?",2,2017,07,09
202,Spent 5 days in Dublin and stayed at Westin,Stayed this past week at Westin Dublin and not only is it in the perfect location for a trip to Dublin - near everything! It also is a very clean hotel with very nice rooms and large bathrooms.  Really enjoyed the stay.  Coming from the states after a long plane ride they tried to accommodate our family of four with an early check in as they knew that we were jet lagged.  All of the staff and management very courteous.  The restaurant and bar in hotel also very nice.  Would stay here again.  ,5,2017,07,08
202,"Great Location, Friendly Staff and Hard to Find Valet","We stayed here for two nights at the end of our road trip and after a long week of driving we arrived to drive in circles through Dublin looking for the valet. Due to the time we arrived (9PM) and the construction in front of the hotel they had taken all the signs down and it wasn't until after we had called that they came out to get us. I've never been to a hotel that takes the signs down to make it difficult to find the parking or where to put your car or even how to get to the front when it's blocked with construction.

The location of this hotel is the best part of this hotel. It's about a 5 min walk to Trinity College, Grafton Street, Temple Bar and so close to most of the other sights you would see in Dublin. The concierge is extremely helpful in planning out your day and the front desk staff is friendly, accommodating and will do what they can to make you happy. 

Quality of the rooms and amenities is mediocre and on par with most 3 star hotels I've stayed at. The rooms are clean and the beds are comfortable, which is  what you expect from a Westin. For a 5 star hotel, I expect fluffy, white towels that aren't falling apart and turn down service, which we didn't receive. I've stayed at numerous Westin hotels and this one just lacked the service and attention to detail that many other properties have.",3,2017,07,07
202,Great location,We stayed 2 nights in a very spacious room with air conditioning.  The bed was wonderful...very comfortable.  While the hotel is on the expensive side; the location is perfect for walking to the main tourist sites.  We were only minutes from Trinity College and the Temple Bar area. We enjoyed our stay and would recommend the Westin.,4,2017,07,07
202,Location Location Location,Loved this hotel and a great stay for Starwood members. Love the proximity to everything like Temple Bar. Its located right next to Trinity college . There is also a hop on Hop off office close by in case you are interested in that. They pulled in a rollaway bed for our teenager. The rooms are very very spacious.,5,2017,07,06
202,"Good location, ideal for business trips",One of best hotels in the city center and rooms are big for Dublin standards. I go to Dublin very often and have tried different hotels and The Westin so far is the best mostly due to its rooms size and furniture.,5,2017,07,06
202,Fantastic hotel,"This hotel from the time we checked in to the time we left was amazing, they couldn't do enough for us, the food the service the staff were brilliant, we will be back.
Afternoon tea was lovely a great experience, right by the main part Temple bar.",5,2017,07,05
202,Great location and service,"We spent 5 nights here in late June. The location is great for visiting Temple Bar, Grafton Street, and Trinity College (Book of Kells). 
Service was warm and sincere. When our room wasn't ready they treated us to a very nice Tea and Scones at the cafe. 
The room was very spacious and clean.  Unfortunately there were 2 Full-Size beds, so my hubby and I had to sleep in separate beds.  The bathroom was bright clean and spacious. My only complaint would be that it was hard to get close to the mirror due to the sink, toilet and lighting. Lots of counter space for those of you who are high maintenance like us. :)
Overall a great choice for your Dublin Holiday.",4,2017,07,05
202,Good hotel if you can get a decent rate ,"Stayed for one night at the Westin in Dublin.  Service was great and friendly. Room comfortable although a bit smaller than I would have expected.  The location is great next to trinity, the river, etc.  however if one is paying between $400-600 per night, I think hard to justify.  Many of the boutique hotel options are below $200 a night and are pretty decent alternatives.  ",4,2017,07,03
202,Great location,"We chose this primarily on the basis of the location and it didn't disappoint.  Literally overlooked Trinity College and quick walk to both Temple Bar area, shops at Grafton Street, and St. Stephen's Green.  I thought the room was of typical Westin standards and a beautiful bathroom.  My only complaint is that I woke up overheated several times - I wonder if this might be one of those rooms where the air is motion activated so you have to wave your arms in the middle of the night.  We enjoyed the breakfast although there were long waits to be seated and to get coffee- not the fault of any particular people but just how they are organized.  I would certainly stay here again.",4,2017,07,02
202,Great location,"Central location is of course great advantage and if you want to taste beers in pubs around not bad to have a short walk to sleep. But not only. Very helpful and polite reception service. For the first time I got offered ""Green bonus"" if I skip room service for a day. For a short stay It's great idea since I don't clean my house every day :). Rooms clean and silent. ",4,2017,06,28
202,WAY overpriced,We stayed at two hotels while in Dublin that were about 5 minutes apart. This hotel was almost almost twice as much and not as nice. The sink has ZERO space for any of your toiletries and there was not even an outlet to plug in their hair dryer in the bathroom itself. Plumbing a problem. Service was lacking. Room temperature was an issue. We ate at their restaurant and had such horrible experience we almost walked out. So slow. Manager even appeared to pop in and out but much like our waiter would not make eye contact. We stayed at the Morrison for the rest of our stay and will do so again on our return. It is close to attractions but so are other hotels. Made me question Westin Brand.,2,2017,06,26
202,Wonderful Birthday Weekend,"My sister, mom and I booked this hotel for a long weekend stay.  From the moment we contacted the hotel (a month in advance) to the second we checked out, our time at this hotel was a pure pleasure.  The room was above and beyond comfortable (we had three people in the room, but you wouldn't know it); the food was delicious; the staff was amazing; the hotel itself was immaculate and modern.  Hands down one of favorite European hotels!",5,2017,06,26
202,Great Location in the city,"We stayed here three nights while exploring the city. This is a great location, centrally located. We caught the Airlink bus and only had a short walk (through construction but it is all over Dublin). We arrived early and was hoping for an early check-in but no luck. They did provide a place to store our luggage and loaned us umbrellas for the pouring rain. 
     We were jet lagged and eager to get in our room. Check-in was 3 PM but when we tried to check-in we were told the person in our room was using late checkout. I considered lowering my score because of this but they were apologetic, gave us drinks in the lounge, and called us as soon as the room was ready (around 4PM). 
     We were in a deluxe room on the 4th floor which had a small balcony outside the full length window with two chairs and a view up O'Connell Street which was very pleasant.  The room was clean, quiet and service was prompt, courteous, and well coordinated. 
     The location was wonderful. Across from Trinity College, Temple Bar and a few blocks from the river. Dublin is an easy city to navigate and this location puts you in the middle of all the major tourist spots.",5,2017,06,23
202,Location Is the Only Saving Grace,"From other reviews I was hoping for a much better experience. The good news is that the location of the hotel is great for tourists as it is with waking distance of most everything and, with just a little more effort you can walk everywhere.  There were a variety of problems with my stay, including room, plumbing, and amenities. Staff and and management response was lackluster and not as expected. Nothing particularly interesting or noteworthy about the hotel. Breakfast was average to not very good. Bar/lounge areas were a plus at an otherwise mediocre property.",3,2017,06,21
202,Extra day in the City,I only spent one evening as I had an extra day in Dublin after a business trip.  It was a great location but the lobby seemed to have a very strong perfume smell that made me a little nauseous.  And this smell was there every time I went through the lobby.  The rooms were small but nice and mine had a great view of Trinity College.  The bathroom was well lighted and clean.  My only big complaint about the room was that the TV did not work.  Luckily I did not spend a lot of time in my room so it didn't matter much.  The staff were very friendly and helpful.  There is a lot of construction right now due to the tram system but you could not ask for a better location next to Temple Bar area.,4,2017,06,20
202,Luxurious and Centrally Located,"My stay at The Westin Dublin was overall a very pleasant one. It is within walking distance from many great restaurants, stores, and attractions. Our group had five people in it and 3 of which have to eat gluten free. The hotel was very accommodating to this and had many gluten free options. The buffet food was very good although the service is a bit slow and they messed up or forgot our orders once or twice. The rooms were luxurious and larger than the average European hotel room, which was a plus because there were three people in one room in our group. There are also American outlets in every room too! The hotel has a very nice lobby and a courtyard lounge on the second floor that was very comfortable to sit in. I would stay at The Westin Dublin again.",5,2017,06,19
202,Wonderful afternoon sipping champagne with strawberries in the Atrium,"We really enjoyed our afternoon in the Westin. We booked a table in the Atrium for 3:45pm so we arrived just as they were kind of wrapping up their afternoon tea session.

We ordered a bottle of Taitinger and strawberries. We had already eaten lunch before we went in so did not indulge in food on this occasion. The waitress was lovely and when my friend sampled the newly opened bottle of champagne, he discovered that it was not properly chilled. The waitress apologised immediately and offered us a glass each of the house Taitinger. We happily accepted and allowed the bottle to chill a while longer.  The service was great overall. I wish I could remember our waitress's name but she had dark hair and was Eastern European. She did great service recovery and we enjoyed the bottle once it was properly chilled. I have visited the Atrium a few times and would definitely go back.",5,2017,06,18
202,"Great location, beautiful hotel","I only stayed here for one night but the room was beautiful, large and all the amenities you could ask for.  They even had a deal with Under Armour where if you forgot workout clothes they would bring some to your room for you to use.  The location is perfect.  Short walking distance to lots of sights (Trinity College, Grafton Street, Dublin Castle, St Stephen's Green, Temple Bar).  It's very close to Temple Bar but just far away enough that you aren't right in the party zone but in a few short steps you can be if you want.  The staff was very helpful, the free wifi worked well.  The breakfast was your generic hotel buffet breakfast but it was fine.  Overall if you are looking for a nice place to stay in a great location I would recommend this.",5,2017,06,16
202,Wonderful hotel in the center of Dublin,"This was the highlight stay of the Ireland trip. The hotel is right in the center of Dublin very close to Temple Bar district and many tourist attractions. Great Platinum recognition (suite upgrade) and the buffet breakfast was absolutely wonderful. The room (O'Connel suite) was very quiet (although on the second floor and facing the street). The whole building has personality and it feels great coming back from a run (using the New Balance equipment provided through the gear lending program) and chatting with the doorman for 5 minutes about the surrounding areas.
Would definite go back if in Dublin again.",5,2017,06,16
202,Excellent Hotel,"We booked The Weston due to its excellent location. From the moment we landed every detail of my stay was dealt with on an extremely professional level. All staff members were great ambassadors for the hotel without being corporate robots, something that many larger groups have not mastered yet. I stay in Dublin quite often and from here on in I won't need to look elsewhere as his superb place will become my 'default' choice. An excellent hotel that is central, discreet and with great food. A very well done from me.",5,2017,06,16
202,Wonderful Location,"We stayed in room #334 for a week in June. The room was spacious, clean, and quiet. The pillows and bed were extremely comfortable. The bathroom was large with a good sized tub with a shower head. There were plenty of outlets and a hub by the desk with an USB port. There was a fridge, but it was on the warm side and was mostly a mini bar. Warm drinks were the normal in Ireland, so can't really fault the hotel for that. The room overlooked a side street with an office building across the way, so little traffic noise. The staff were always very friendly and helpful.

The Westin Dublin is in a wonderful location. Fleet St. and the whole Temple Bar area is literally across the road. Trinity is right next to the hotel. If you are looking to use the Hop On Hop Off buses, there are two stops very close by. The place to meet the Extreme Ireland/Irish Day Tours is also very close. Really there were so many things that were an easy walk from the Westin. We walked to St. Patrick's Cathedral, Dublin Castle, Molly Malone statue, Grafton Street, St. Stephen's Green, River Liffey, Temple Bar, and up O'Connell Street. All of this was a short walking distance. 

The only complaint I have about this hotel is specific to me. I'm allergic to certain fragrances, mostly florals. In the lobby of the hotel, they were burning candles 24/7 with a strong white tea scent. So I ended up with a mild headache each time I passed through. Obviously, most people would not have that problem and would find it pleasant. Also it was only in the lobby, so the rest of the hotel was candle free. 

We would love to stay here again in the future should we find ourselves in Dublin again!",5,2017,06,15
202,Stay at your own risk,"Starting with the hotel manager and right down through the front desk staff, this hotel displayed horribly poor customer relations by insisting on charging us for our room even though our plane was canceled due to being hit by a baggage cart.  We were informed by Westin hotels that this is a highly unusual response on the part of one of their hotels and they were aghast as well. 
Typically if the cancellation is beyond a loyal customer's control, the hotel will not further punish by charging for the unoccupied room.  Starwood immediately filed a protest on our behalf, and STILL the Westin Dublin manager refused to reconsider the matter.  I sent an email to the manager as well, and still he still refused.  I have been a loyal Starwood Platinum customer for 20 years, and I never seen such arrogance and disregard for an unfortunate situation.  I will continue my Starwood loyalty, because they did the right thing and tried hard to help out, but I will NEVER stay at this property again.  That kind of behavior takes a 5 star hotel down to a 1 star hotel in a nano second.",1,2017,06,14
202,Awesome,"Stayed here 3 nights at the beginning of an Ireland in 7 days trip (Ireland needs greater than 7 days FYI).  The hotel staff, the concierge and the restaurant dinning staff were all so friendly. Especially liked the knowledgable concierge who suggested the Cobblestone on the Friday night!  Outstanding location and a gem within SPG.  Trinity and book is right across the street...for all you nerd types.  ST",5,2017,06,12
202,Smart Hotel in Great Location,"Stayed for four nights. Hotel in great location in centre of Dublin, close to all attractions and amenities. Very good hotel, friendly staff and the breakfast had lots of choice of hot and cold options. The only disappointment was the size of our room, on the fourth floor, only had roof windows, so felt a bit enclosed. Comfortable enough but could've been a bit bigger. Bathroom door did not close, problem with the latch, so we could hear the extractor going constantly. We told reception who said they would send somebody to look at it. Somebody came to turn the extractor off but the door wasn't fixed. Also towel rail was hanging off the wall. Just a few little niggles which you would expect to be fixed, especially for the price paid to stay.",4,2017,06,12
202,Best Hotel in Dublin,"The Westin Dublin is the best hotel in Dublin.  It is one of three hotels that I stayed in in Dublin in May and has the best furnishings, service, food, and is conveniently located steps away from Trinity College, Temple Bar, and a short walk to Grafton Street. 

I booked a suite using SPG points.  It was a large suite with a spacious living room, large bedroom, and large bathroom.  The shower had excellent water pressure. The room was clean and comfortable.  It was also quiet, especially considering the extensive roadworks going on outside of the hotel.

The service at this hotel was excellent throughout my two night stay.  Warm reception upon check-in.  One night I ate in the hotel restaurant, Morelands Grill.  The food was good and the service excellent.  

I look forward to returning.",5,2017,06,09
202,CENTRAL LOCATION AND WONDERFUL,"We spent two nights at the Westin Dublin in mid-May.  The location could not have been better.  It's an easy walk to Grafton Street, the Temple Bar area, the GPO, Trinity College (next door), the Cathedral and much more.  A special thanks to Leslie Martin, the concierge, for helping me to get the last ticket available to tour Kilmainham Gaol (Jail). We visited Dublin 21 years ago and stayed outside of Dublin,  We felt we had a much better experience in Dublin this time staying at the central location of the Westin.  The bar downstairs was a wonderful place for a good drink after a busy day of touring.  Everyone was friendly and helpful.",5,2017,06,06
202,Very nice bar / dining area,"I went there for a business meeting in the evening, and I am happy to say that I really enjoyed it
It's very nice, calm and almost a secret place as not a lot of people would go there to have a drink. But this is the whole beauty of the place.
Stunning place, with great staff and lovely atmosphere ",5,2017,06,06
202,2 week stay for work,"My stay was great. Clean room and property, friendly and helpful staff, and both restaurant and room service was great. If you eat in the restaurant, I highly recommend the gnocchi! 

Mo was very friendly and helpful and prided himself on recognizing guests.",5,2017,06,02
202,"Location, location","I  liked the loacation just next to Trinity College best. A great point to start exploring Dublin.
We had a quiet and nice room on the first floor. The bed is very comfortable. The bathroom had a shower and a tub!",5,2017,06,01
202,Excellent location,The location is great...next to Trinity College and near lots of restaurants.  The rooms are large.  We stayed here at the beginning and end of our trip and were very comfortable both times.  There is a lot of construction nearby for a new tram line system.  There was talk about upcoming restrictions in driving downtown which could change getting to and from this location.  We hear different stories from the locals about this so it is hard to say what will happen.,5,2017,06,01
202,A elegant hotel in the heart of Dublin,"We were back in Dublin and decided to try the Westin Dublin -- this was an excellent decision.  The location is excellent and the rooms are well appointed and elegant.
I do not know where the hotel gets its pillows -- but they must have been the most comfortable pillows I have ever slept upon.
The rooms are large with every amenity as are the bathrooms.
We had breakfast at the hotel and it was delicious.  We also entertained a guest in the Atrium which is a beautiful room oozing of old world charm.
We usually prefer smaller boutique hotels and B&Bs but sometimes in larger cities, we do stay in larger hotels and this one especially was the perfect choice.",5,2017,05,31
202,Wonderful One Night Stay,"We had been looking to visit this hotel for some time and the wait was absolutely worth it. We had arrived later than expected and were greeted by a wonderful concierge who parked our car for us. Check in was friendly and efficient. Before we went out for dinner we had a cocktail in the bar which had a great atmosphere and the bar man was able to recommend a perfect cocktail for our taste. The beds were amazing, probably one of the comfiest i have experienced in any hotel. We will absolutely be returning to this hotel again and recommending it to everyone!",5,2017,05,30
202,Enjoyed,"Thoroughly enjoyed our stay. I screwed up my dates because of the day difference in which we were to leave and arrive home and the hotel did all they could to work with me. The afternoon tea you must book in advance, it fills quickly. It is nice. Our room was very pretty and looked over the center ""courtyard"" area where high tea was served. Our room was clean and because construction was occurring on the main street, we were out in the interior room to ensure a quiet visit. Would definitely recommend and can't wait to go back. ",5,2017,05,29
202,Afternoon Tea ,Visited for afternoon tea and it was fabulous.  wonderful staff and food we really enjoyed the whole experience.  we were supposed to be in the atrium but there was a function on in it so we were in the Moreland grill at the front of the hotel.  Staff apologised for the move of venue and offered us a complimentary glass of prosecco which was a nice touch.  We went for the traditional afternoon tea and thought the selection of food was excellent.  overall a very enjoyable experience I highly recommend.,5,2017,05,29
202,Afternoon tea,"Afternoon tea with a difference! We opted for The Peculiar Afternoon Tea which serves Mojito served in a tea pot instead of tea. 
The selection of savoury and sweet morsels was delicious.
You can opt for a glass of prosseco or champagne at an added cost.
The waiter was very pleasant and the surroundings are lovely in this gorgeous hotel.
I would recommend this, it was a lovely treat.

202,"Great hotel, centrally located, steps from Temple Bar & Trinity College!","We stayed at the Westin Dublin during our visit to Ireland this Spring and we couldn't have been happier with the location, the spacious and comfortable room and with the excellent service from the hotel staff.  The concierge helped us arrange for a rental car (cheaper than what we had reserved via the internet ahead of the visit) and helped up map our day trips across the country.  While in Dublin we were able to walk everywhere from the hotel because the hotel is so centrally located.  When we return to Dublin we will definitely stay at the Westin!",5,2017,05,24
202,An excellent hotel in a perfect location,"My wife and I stayed at this hotel during our April vacation in Ireland. On the plus side, the service at this hotel is excellent. Our room was rather spacious, immaculately clean and well-appointed. The lobby has a couple of peat fires before which you can dispel the chill that comes with Ireland except in July and August. The location is hard to beat, right across the street from the entrance to Trinity College. We were given a room that overlooked the central courtyard, which was very quiet.  The only downside was that the breakfast buffet was only a bit better than average and the service was a bit slow.",5,2017,05,24
202,Beautiful rooms,"The Westin Hotel in Dublin is in the perfect location for all the famous places you want to visit. The Hotel staff are welcoming, professional and friendly, the hotel is luxurious, rooms and bath/shower rooms are well equipped and beautifully designed. The toiletries are excellent quality, the beds and linen are so comfortable, the air conditioning was easy to work and great as it was warm at nights, the breakfast selection and quality is probably the best we have experienced in our travels. This is our second visit to Dublin and the Westin Hotel but certainly will not be our last, fantastic.",5,2017,05,24
202,They have an accounting/ billing problem,"OMG
Great place , great personnel 
But 
They double billed us and we tried our best to explain what they did
They did not get it
We paid two bar bills at the Mint Bar by credit card
They still charged our room
Asked for a credit
Showed them the proof !!!!!
Still no credit !!!!
Very dissatisfied ",3,2017,05,22
202,Stunning,"Stayed her for one night for a special occasion. Checkin was smoothe and facilitated by a very friendly and informative lady. 

We had the Grattan Suite for a night. The room was large, tastefully decorated and very comfortable. Good selection in the mini bar and coffee machine available for use. 

The best was very comfortable. Crisp white linen and quality mattress. 

Bathroom was large with bath and separate shower. Quality bathroom products were supplied. 

Had some cocktails in the bar.  Very reasonably priced at ‚Ç¨12.50 each. Cocktails were amazing.  

Breakfast was served in the exchange restaurant and had an excellent selection. Staff were friendly and attentive without being intrusive. 

Highly recommend this hotel. Can wait to stay again. ",5,2017,05,22
202,Displeased with my stay,"My husband and I checked into the Westin Dublin last night. I was excited to stay here again as I had enjoyed my last stay a few years ago. We were debating between here or the Intercontinental and I opted for the Westin. 

This was clearly the wrong choice. 

Our room was very warm upon arrivial however we decided to give it a chance. We both didn't really sleep and at 1:30am I called the front desk to mention that we needed to move rooms today (5/18,) as we're here for three days on vacation. One of the managers spoke with my husband at 9am and said they could move us (at 9am) however I was in the shower. Therefore he asked to have us moved at 10am. 

By 10:20am no one had shown up. 

I called the front desk and the person I spoke with didn't know what I was talking about. Finally after putting me on hold she said concierge would bring up our keys. I assume the same person who brought up our new keys was who I spoke with. There was no bellhop to help us with our luggage, (the women who I spoke with in the middle of the night asked me what we would be doing today and assured me that we didn't even need to be in the room to be moved, the hotel would handle everything.) The new room was smaller than our old one with a better view. 

Comfort is what is key to us and while the view is nice it's not making up for a bad night of sleep.

I expect that when a loyal SPG customer highlights a probelm that it will be addressed and the staff will go above and beyond to rectify it. 

I thought we would have been upgraded to a suite or given something special upon arrival to our new room if a suite couldn't be provided. Instead we had to hunt down the keys and move our own luggage. That doesn't sound like a luxury hotel stay. 

So far this experience has been awful and upsetting. I would not recommend staying here to my friends and colleagues. What is the point of being an SPG member if it doesn't afford you any benefits? 

I called down again and asked to speak with a manager who showed me another room exactly like the one we had before. After seeing how upset I was she said she would send us a bottle of wine this evening. 

I am extremely dissapointed as I've wasted a lot of money and time on a mediocere hotel. A bottle of wine hardly seems sufficient. 

The next time I return to Dublin I will be looking at the Intercontinental, the Westbury or the Merrion for my stay.  The Westin doesn't seem to care about their customers.",2,2017,05,18
202,"Excellent Hotel, great location","If you re coming to visit Dublin for a few days this is the hotel for you to get a perfect stay to enjoy the down town of the city and a lot of attractions in its area. I stayed at the westin for 2 weeks for business.. it is at a perfect location where it is not very far from my workplace in Eastpoint and close to many attractions (Temple Bar, Grafton Street, trinity college, Dublin Castle etc..).. I stayed in the queen room, it was very spacious and picked out specifically for me by the hotel clerk as i am staying for 2 weeks. The breakfast was okay a bit expensive if it is not included in your package... there are 2 very close starbucks for your morning coffee, exchange store, and an atm just outside the hotel, the christmas decoration was put as it was already November and it was very classy and pretty. Overall the Hotel is very classy and has a slight touch of luxury, but it is not perfect if you re looking for a hip hotel for young tourists, there is not much to do in the hotel Gym is small, i don't recall that there is any indoor pool, and the bar is a bit gloomy. but if you want a hotel for business or for tourism where you re going to spend most of your time outside, i highly recommend it given its perfect location.",5,2017,05,18
202,50th Anniversary ,"We went to Dublin to celebrate our 50th Anniversary.
Our selection of the Westin was perfect.
Everything was perfect. People, food, drink, rooms were all top notch.
Can not say enough good thing about Laszio Martin, Head Concierge. Everyday he took great care of us as though we were the only guest.

Next trip the only place we will use.

202,"Very nice hotel, great location","Great central location, easy walking distance to trinity college, and temple bar area. Nice touches everywhere, friendly accommodating staff. They treat starwood platinum members right which isn't the case at all the starwood brands. Amazing bar in the basement, that makes a smoke infused old fashioned that is a sight to behold. Room was spacious and comfortable with nice amenities. If you are on a budget, this place is pretty expensive, the temple bar inn just across the street is a nice chic hotel for 1/4 the price, but is right on the main drag and is very loud. Only downside and its not their fault is there is a lot of construction going on.",5,2017,05,16
202,Excellent staff and overall experience,"I was here for three nights.  The staff was great and very proactive in anticipating our needs.  Really only two things stopped me from giving this 5 stars

Cons
-A number of the rooms overlook an internal tea room. which is a strange setup.  We were in one of them for one night and it might as well have been a windowless room (since there's no privacy at all if you have the curtains open).  We moved after the first night but if you book a room here you have a decent chance of getting on of them
-The breakfast was okay, nothing great, nothing terrible.  To get five stars I'd want to be able to say something more than ""it was food"".

But that said, this is a good hotel and I'd stay there again

Pros
-Central Dublin location with a lot of attractions within walking distance
-Staff was very nice and went out of their way to make the experience pleasant.
-Beds were comfortable
-Internet was fast and reliable

Tip:  Get an outside facing room",4,2017,05,15
202,Dublin westin,Nice large room. Very nice. Great location. Next to trinity college. Courteous staff. Ate at keoughs for breakfast about 2 blocks away that opens early.  Concierge provided good recommendations. Would stay there again.,5,2017,05,12
202,Perfect Location to be in Dublin,"I've stayed at the Westin several times over the last few years and I regularly enjoy the experience. The hotel is a classic, older but graceful and thoughtfully executed throughout. The location is fantastic, I stay there for work and access to all the companies along the river but I also appreciate its proximity to the pubs, Grafton Street, St. Stephen's Green, and many other of the attractions this great city has to offer. 

The rooms are well appointed and the staff is reserved and respectful. I have only sampled the breakfast at the property although there are other venues for the guests to try as well. Personally I like to get out and explore the local area and given this hotel's fantastic location I am always able to do that.",4,2017,05,12
202,Need more Gold stars,"The reason I only gave them 5 stars is because I couldn't give them ten.  Now the hotel is standard Westin quality with nice rooms, comfortable beds and conveniently located in the center of it all.  There is construction going on around us but it didn‚Äôt impact our stay at all and it will soon be complete.  But none of this is what I want to focus on in this review.  The service of the front desk staff, in particular Tracy and Anne Marie, went beyond good, better, best, exemplary, super duper and peaked somewhere between Holy Shnarkies and ‚ÄúCan we adopt them they're so nice?‚Äù.  It all started out when I received an email from the staff noting my impending arrival and if there was anything they could do to make it better.  We've all received these and normally ignore them.  I‚Äôm seldom normal.  I replied back asking for a room with a view of the cliffs on the opposite end of the country, and beer tap in my room, a chunk of Blarney Stone on my nightstand, oh yeah, and my own leprechaun.  I mentioned not wanting to share with the rest of our floor.  There's no long story short so bear with me.  After arriving and meeting the young ladies and sharing a laugh over my email we wandered out for dinner.  Two hours later we returned and our room looked like the showdown prize from Let's Make a Deal.  Adorning our desk was a photo of the Cliffs of Mohr to place in our window, a letter explaining the class we‚Äôd have to take to allow us to draw a Guinness pint, and two coupons to the hotel bar for pints to tide us over until then.  A chip of the Blarney Stone in a box, guaranteed to bring us good luck (I won a 2 Euro scratch off the next day!), a cute little stuffed leprechaun and an assortment of liquored and candied goodies that left us completely speechless.  And my wife was worried I upset them with my list of ‚Äúdemands‚Äù.  These girls did all this on their own out of their own pockets, I'm sure racing the streets while we were dining, just to make our vacation.  THAT IS CUSTOMER SERVICE.  Now I don‚Äôt expect everyone to get their own Blarney Stone, but I will betcha that you get a big smile, a helpful attitude and that they go out of their way to make sure you feel comfortable during your stay.  Oh and a post script‚Ä¶we came back a few days later on our way out of the country for one more night and as luck would have it, one of the suites wasn‚Äôt being used and guess who got upgraded.  We have a spiral staircase in our hotel room!  Wickedly awesome!  So if you're in Dublin on Business or Pleasure, book a room at the Weston and tell 'em Mark sent you.",5,2017,05,11
202,"Quality, Friendly Service","Quiet, clean room with all the amenities, including built-in power outlets for US and European electronics.  Great location within walking distance of all major attractions.  Literally one block from Trinity College (Book of Kells).  The best part was the friendly and approachable hotel staff!  Wonderful stay. Great for kids and couples alike.",5,2017,05,11
202,Pick a suite. It's worth the upgrade.,"Overall, we were happy with our experience here. Was worth the ratings it gets and does deserve the luxury status. 
We booked here many months in advance for 4 nights in Dublin as a couples retreat. We chose one of the Writers suites with a balcony. 
Our arrival was anticipated and very smooth. 
Our room was large with a separate sitting room and small walk in closet. We were greeted with a fruit tray and bottle of wine. 
The marble bathroom is large. Soaker tub was present. 
Balcony was private but could only barely see over the ledge. Had views of trinity college which was beautiful when you looked over.
All the amenities and details were thought out.
Laundry was a touch expensive, but available. Spa services are also available in the room. Tea service was also present and appreciated. 
The room, despite having the construction out front, was very quiet. 
The breakfast option was quite good. The staff were not so good in the restaurant, but not terrible. They didn't mention you could order things off the menu in a limited capacity, which would have been nice to know. A little slow on getting drinks and coming to check on you.
We did also have some good cocktails at the Mint lounge. 
We did not take advantage of the fitness center or the Atrium lounge, which offers a fancy afternoon tea and brunch. (Which I think you have to book ahead for.)
We would come back here.",5,2017,05,09
202,Wonderful hotel and staff,"Absolutely loved this hotel and it's staff. I would happily stay here again. From the beautiful decor and clean rooms, to the friendly, smiling staff. In addition, the ever happy doormen that are happy to dole out suggestions.",5,2017,05,09
202,Lovely Hotel with Good Service,"We stayed here for our 20th anniversary and were greeted very professionally, given an upgrade (I'm a gold member) and there was a lovely assortment of sweets and things for us in the room. Thank you, thank you!! 

The room we were given was located in the front of the hotel and we were on a fairly low floor. Our first night was fine but when we returned the second night around 9:30 the construction out front was in full swing. We waited until after 11:30 to see if it would stop and the front desk told us it would be a couple of more hours and they would give us another room to sleep in. Since we were already ready for bed, we opted to stay which was a mistake as the construction lasted all night and into the morning. It would have been good to be notified when we returned to the fact that the construction would be ongoing into the night so we could have moved earlier rather than after we were already in bed.....

The next morning we requested a room change - which was honored without hesitation and with a nice call from the manager. They put us in another room on the same floor but downgraded us to a much smaller room. Not a big deal since it was our last night but another room at the same level would have been nice. As it turns out, there was no construction going on that night....If we knew that, we would have stayed in the original room. Maybe just a some better communication between the hotel and the city and the hotel and the guests about the construction would go a long way. 

Other than the construction - this is a wonderful hotel that lives up to the Westin name. The location is perfect!! The breakfast buffet is excellent and the staff is excellent.",4,2017,05,08
202,Home away from home,"This is a fantastic hotel!  Always feel like I'm coming home when I'm walking into the lobby.  The staff is beyond professional, kind and welcoming.  The location of the hotel is perfect. Situated right in the middle of everything, a short walk will land you in the Guinness brewery, or countless other amazing sites.  When I come to Ireland, one of the things I look most forward to is my stay at the Westin.  And that's saying quite a bit to be actually looking forward to the hotel!",5,2017,05,07
202,"Amazing food, amazing settingQ","I went for afternoon tea here today with some friends. We were greeted by some very helpful staff and shown to our table. Service was immaculate and we found the staff to be courteous and friendly. Out of 6 of us, 4 ordered the traditional AT, and 2 ordered the peculiar AT. 
The traditional AT was absolutely stunning. Everything was perfectly flavoured, and all the tastes were well-balanced. I cannot a single bad thing on this menu. 
My congrats goes to the staff, in particular the chefs! The atmosphere, while amazing, was nothing compared to the food. Would recommend, 10/10!",5,2017,05,06
202,"Great location, great hotel","Great service on arrival, 
The rooms were good sized however the toilet in my room seemed to need to be unclogged, drainage from the toilet and the bath were very slow. 
Excellent location to lots of the central Dublin pubs and restaurants. Concierge were very helpful with directions and seems to know the city well.
I was pleasantly surprised as I thought that there would be a lot of noise from the road work but once inside couldn't hear a thing and loved the views over Trinity College.",5,2017,05,05
202,Westin Dublin,"Went to Dublin for a few days of business meetings.  I stayed at the Westin Dublin, which is centrally located.  I reserved a very nice suite that had amazing views of Trinity College.  The hotel is well maintained and my room was very luxurious.  It had two floors with a small office and workout space on the second floor.  The hotel staff was very welcoming and assisted me with getting dinner reservations at some of the best restaurants in Dublin.  The also assisted in setting up a guide to take me around the city to see the local sites.  I would highly recommend the Westin Dublin if you happen to visit Dublin.",5,2017,05,03
202,Room Choice very important,"We and another couple stayed at the Westin twice, when we landed in Dublin and 3 more nights before our departure.  The room on the first night faced the interior and was hot because the air conditioning was insufficient to cool the room and the window did not open.  As it turned out, the inner courtyard is enclosed with a glass roof so an open window would not have helped.
On our return visit, we specifically asked for a room with a window that opened and as a result got a lovely room on an upper floor with a view. Bed was comfortable and room was spacious.  My only complaint would be the small bathroom with no place to put toiletries.  The couple traveling with us ended up with a suite with a view and lots of space everywhere.  Lesson learned is that you have to be very specific when you check in and choose your room wisely.",4,2017,05,02
202,Some Disappointing Aspects,"I stayed in the Westin for 1 night over a weekend. The hotel itself is in a prime location in the center of Dublin. The layout of the hotel is really nice and it is extremely well maintained. Bedroom was a nice size and the beds were comfortable. As the hotel is a 5*, these are the standards that I would expect.

However, I found some aspects not so good. Upon check-in there was a discrepancy on the booking and it seemed to take at least 15 to 20 minutes to sort out. As the problem was on the hotel side, I found this first impression to be quite poor.

After an evening attending a concert, we returned to the hotel and were looking forward to a few quiet relaxing drinks at the bar. We had 1 drink, and when we went to buy a 2nd we were told the bar had closed. I looked at my watch and it was 11:50pm and explained I was a resident. However I was told by the unfriendly bar man that the bar closes to residents at 11:45pm. I have to say I was astounded. I am staying in a 5* hotel, and I could not have a drink at this time. It must be the only hotel in Dublin, if not Ireland that this policy is in place for this time.

Upon check-out, the person did not engage me whatsoever and barely looked at me, except for the words cash or credit card? No mention on ""Did I enjoy my stay"" etc. As this person has a front of house role, I think she would need a refresher course in friendliness.

Overall the hotel itself is extremely nice, but my experience was spoilt over some poor non-customer friendly hotel policies and some non 5* staff.",3,2017,05,02
202,Fabulous Afternoon Tea ,"We booked Afternoon Tea here at last minute and were delighted to get a table! Afternoon tea is served in the airy and bright atrium in the centre of the hotel. We were served a glass of proseco on arrival while we chose which menu to go for. All three of us decided on the Most Peculiar Afternoon Tea. Gorgeous selection of savoury and sweet with some surprises (popping candy!) and 'tea', a gin mojito, served in a tea pot and tea cups! Very Alice In Wonderland. Excellent service and not at all rushed! Will definitely recommend and be back! ",5,2017,05,01
202,"construction nearby, pay for everything","There's major construction going on in front of the hotel. It's not their fault so I shall not comment on that in this review. 

This is a beautiful and well maintained Westin in a historic building in a central location. 

Expect to pay for everything extra here. This is par for the course at luxury hotels, but for elite members (I am SPG Platinum) fees are almost always waived. Not the case here. We were a party of 3 and were forced to pay 45 EUR per night for an extra bed even though we were upgraded. Also the platinum benefit of complimentary breakfast is strictly enforced for 2 people only. Give me a break. I get that this is a business and there are rules to follow, but have some flexibility with your top-tier elites.
",3,2017,04,30
202,Excellent choice for staying downtown in Dublin,"This was our first visit to Dublin, and the Westin was located within a walk of everything we wanted to see. Our guide dropped us off at the Guinness tour and we walked back to the hotel from there, exploring the city along the way. There is a great deal of construction around the area where the hotel is located and Trinity College, but we managed to get around okay. Three couples each had different room layouts, and it was interesting to see the variation. Ours had a tub and shower, and a comfortably large room. The king bed was very comfortable, but there is only one comfortable chair (with a foot stool).  The shower has marble floor, and it seemed very slick, but we were very careful. There are no hand bars in the shower. 
As Platinum members of SPG, we were offered breakfast included, and we took advantage of that both mornings. Highlights of the breakfast were honeycomb honey; fruit smoothies; delicious, flakey whole wheat croissants (also fruit-filled croissants). They also had other breakfast fare, but these were unusual.
We went to the Mint Bar downstairs in the hotel late the first night, and they had a DJ for entertainment. Their drink menu was extensive, and good.
The employees were all helpful and friendly.  We dined in the restaurant on our last night. Each ordered appetizers and we also ordered glasses of wine or beer. Our server was excellent.
Checkout was an easy process, although they had to make a correction on our bill.

202,Bloomsday Adventure,We visited the Westin for Bloomsday. The hotel is elegant and the staff is friendly and accommodating. The lobby is welcoming and the restaurant serves good food especially breakfast. The rooms were nicely appointed with comfortable beds and nice bath facilities.The hotel is within walking distance of all the Dublin attractions. Trinity College is across the street and on the weekend night there was some street noise from the lads on their way home from the pubs.Enjoyed the shops on Grafton Street and walking through the Temple Bar area. We also spent Bloomsday walking the Ulysses journey.,5,2017,04,28
202,Simply awesome! We can't wait to go back!,"I can't say enough of this hotel. We were greeted with a wonderful welcome despite arriving late.  We were upgraded to a lovely 2 floor suite and had a welcome note and Bulters chocolates to greet us in the room.  Room service dining was lovely, the Valut bar was great (service could improve though) and overall, we enjoyed every minute of our stay. We had a balcony and great views of the city.  The Westin is easy to get to by airport shuttle bus and is in walking distance to just about everything in Dublin. Breakfast was tasty and the property itself was charming.  We look forward to our next stay.",5,2017,04,27
202,Great Location,"The Westin Dublin is perfectly located for all that you want to see and do when visiting Dublin. The lobby is welcoming (with twin fires burning), and elegant without being stuffy. The rooms are cozy but not cramped, and the bathrooms are nicely appointed. The windows block most of the sound from the street below, which is busy. Beds are comfortable and the service is professional.

If in Dublin again, this would certainly be a top choice.",4,2017,04,27
202,Great location in city center,"My son and I stayed here on our way home to the US after traveling 2 weeks throughout Europe.  We had a long layover at Dublin Airport and were looking forward to a night's rest on the Westin Heavenly Beds - and they did not disappoint!  The hotel was a quick 20 minutes from the airport and very centrally located.  In the morning, we had a lovely breakfast at the hotel and were able to walk through the Temple Bar area and walk to Grafton Street and Trinity College.  We had a very quick visit, but the hotel was in a fantastic location, comfortable and super clean.  Would definitely return for a longer stay in the future.",4,2017,04,25
202,Few days in Dublin,My husband and I spent 4 days in Dublin on our two week vacation. We arrived at the Westin after an all night flight. The Westin let us check in early. This hotel is centrally located in walking distance to everything. Trinity College is across the street.  Temple bar is down the street! Great restaurants and pubs too!!! Great safe location ,5,2017,04,25
202,Lovely,"This is a wonderful hotel. The staff are helpful, facilities a lovely and the restaurant excellent. We decided to go Green which meant no housekeeping services. The idea is great but the drawback is the garbage does not get emptied and toilet paper is not replenished without asking. The location is great for both the bars, shopping, attractions and the Hop On/Hop Off Bus. Would definitely stay again",5,2017,04,24
202,superb,upgraded to a suite on 2 floors with a circular staircase. wonderful helpful staff.  one of the best breakfast buffets we had on the whole trip.  located next to the University and Book of Kells.  highly recommend this hotel.,5,2017,04,24
202,"Great location, not top-tier quality","Pros:
1-Great location to walk in central Dublin
2-Pretty lobby
3-Friendly front desk staff

Cons:
1-The toilet in the room I had when I checked in was ""unclean"" (and I'm being polite) and the toilet seat was loose.  I asked the front desk to fix things, and they apologized and offered to give us complimentary drinks when we sat down for lunch in their restaurant.  Well, drinks and lunch with 2 kids was thoughtful (if not exactly generous), but then when the bill came, they charged us $3 each for the iced tea refills!
2-The front door service was poor.  I walked outside and asked the door man where the best place to get a taxi was, and he said right in front of the hotel, then just stood there.

This hotel has a lot of potential but needs to pay attention to the details a bit more.",3,2017,04,24
202,Excellent! PERFECT location to explore Dublin!,"Excellent location, restaurant incredible, staff: AMAZING! 

Highly recommend this location for a visit to Dublin. Perfect location to everything. Directly across from Fleet St- for bars, pubs, restaurants, shopping...... We walked all over Dublin from this location and found it to be just perfectly located. 
It's a cozy Westin with fireplaces, and a really great European feel. The restaurant (new: Morelands) was EXCELLENT! 
The breakfast was amazing. 
The staff were accommodating on many levels: just excellent. 
Oh, and very cool pub downstairs called Mint! The night we went they had live music - (the Ratzingers) - who were incredible.

202,Wonderful place to stay,"Beautiful property in a great location. We loved it here. The reception and
room service were excellent.  The concierge was extremely helpful. The room was very large and perfect for three of us.  There is major road work going on in Dublin but it did not bother us at all at the hotel. ",5,2017,04,23
202,Amazing property!,"So pleased we were able to get in!  It's absolutely lovely.  The staff, the building, the rooms, the beds, the food ... the BAR, are all wonderful and patient with us Americans lol.  True walking distance to so many things from shopping to pubs to parks and colleges.  The only negative is completely out of their control, the LONG TERM road construction which is scattered about Dublin actually.  I would Highly recomend this property, the beds are incredibly comfy, the bathrooms are roomy, the amenities are perfect!",5,2017,04,22
202,Excellent location,"Excellent concierge service. The concierge on staff cleared up a problem with a third-party taxi company, and helped to arrange another means of transportation to the airport. Clean rooms and comfortable beds. Downtown location is close to many tourist sights, including Trinity College and Temple Bar.",5,2017,04,18
202,Smile is free,"The hotel is perfectly located in the centre
We never took a taxi as everything is within walking distance. 
At time of booking , Luwen was very kind by accommodating my family needs. Jelena at reception was adorable, Mo the bellboy fantastic and last but not least Laszlo at Moreland's grill impeccable and professional! Ps the restaurant serves one of the best breakfast i'd have had! 
Bravo ! Bravo @westin team",5,2017,04,17
202,Excellent Location -- Excellent Hotel,"The staff was friendly, helpful, and knowledgeable. The location next to Trinity College and close to the Temple Bar area and the River Liffey made walking nearly everywhere downtown enjoyable. The junior suite view room was comfortable and the marble bathroom was large and well-equipped (soaking bathtub and separate shower). There was no bidet which I had expected for a room of this price. There was no refrigerator in the room, but there was a Nespresso coffee maker, and quick room service. We stayed here for 4 days when we were in town for the Dublin Marathon last October and plan to stay when we return for another visit in June.",5,2017,04,16
202,One night stay,"Stayed at the Westin for one night, went to a show at the Bord Gais. Brilliant location, right in the heart of Dublin. The room is well appointed and was lucky enough to be over looking Trinity College. The hotel is very well kept and the staff were very attentive and pleasant. Had a cocktail in the Mint Bar and it was well made and tasted great, was quiet but it was mid week and was told that it was a great spot on the weekend. Breakfast had everything you would want and again staff very good. Great base if you are planning on touring Dublin.",5,2017,04,16
202,Wonderful accomodation,"The Westin was an excellent choice for our stay in Dublin. It had all of the modern amenities in a perfect location. It is right in the center of the temple bar area, near Saint Stephen's Green, the river, and Trinity College. There is an excellent modern cocktail bar in the basement of the building that we thoroughly enjoyed. ",5,2017,04,14
202,Ideal Central Location ,"Extended a business trip from the Irish coast and into Dublin. The Westin is right next door to Trinity College (and the famous book of Kells). Center of everything location-wise. Buses right in front, tourist authority down the block (where you can book all kinds of great tours), steps away from the Grafton Street shopping and markets, across the street and steps away from the Temple Bar area. All doable on foot. The concierge is always on hand day or evening and has the best recommendations. Booked theater tickets, restaurants for us. The roaring fire in the fireplace was always a welcome sight upon arrival back to hotel in the evenings. There are chairs to linger in with your coffee (Starbucks a few doors down if interested). I will be returning here again. Made me feel so welcome and at home!

202,Central Dublin Hotel,"Stayed St.Patrick's weekend including the rugby .. Come on Ireland :)
 Very comfortable bed, room and bathroom. Excellent breakfast. Nice relaxing areas to read. Really central to explore Dublin. Friendly helpful staff.

Will definitely return.",4,2017,04,13
202,Perfect location and all you'd expect from The Westin,"My husband and I spent 5 nights at The Westin Dublin in a deluxe room.  The room itself was very good albeit slightly dated.  The room and bathroom were both spacious and there was good wardrobe space.
The foywer with two roaring fires was lovely and staff courteous and helpful.
The best park of the hotel was its supremely convenient location.  Easy walk to Trinity College, many sights and the Temple Bar restaurant and bar district.",5,2017,04,13
202,Ok Service/ Good  Location but not now,"This hotel and staff are very nice where the location ""should"" be nice someday. The roads right in front of the hotel are completely under construction and from what I hear will be until December, 2017- too bad that was not fully disclosed when I booked this hotel for 6 nights. Two nights in a row, they worked on the road until 2:30 am making it virtually impossible to sleep. Room service charged 5‚Ç¨ per tray to get room service  even if one item was ordered with very limited choices for food on site other than breakfast. I found service at breakfast to be weak unless you ordered the buffet- they even blew off servicing our room one day in hopes we would buy into their ""green"" program of no service in exchange for a $5 meal credit, some SPG Points, or a donation....the more I write the more I think this hotel is less than average.",3,2017,04,12
202,European Vacation ,Lovely hotel with very nice rooms. Dining is not the greatest. I am not a fan of the Westin amenities. Good location for taking the hop on hop off around town. Nothing european about this hotel......usual Westin,4,2017,04,12
202,Fantastic Hotel in a Great Location,"I stayed at the Westin for a week-long business trip to Dublin, and found it to be ideally located, right in the heart of south Dublin, close to an amazing array of food options, and close to public transportation and airport transfer services. My company's room rate made it very affordable, and I will not hesitate to stay here again when I return (I have two or three more trips scheduled over the next four months).

I interacted with the front desk staff numerous times, not just at check-in/out, and everybody I dealt with were polite, friendly, and professional--everything I would expect from a Westin property.

My room, on the third floor, was clean and tidy, and very good size for a European hotel. The king-sized Heavenly Bed was as good as advertised, and I used the desk area throughout my visit for work and eating meals. The bathroom was very large, with both a glass-enclosed shower and a separate bath, and featured a full-length mirror. Again, the Westin touch was evident by the thick cotton bathrobes.

There was plenty of storage in both the closets (two) and in my nighstand to unpack my belongings, and a suitcase stand on which to store my empty luggage. I watched TV several times, and it was functional, although it took several seconds to display the main menu after turning it on via the remote control.

Room service, which I ordered several times, was prompt and friendly, although there were a few issues at first--some jam was forgotten for my toast on the first day, and I was not provided with a spoon to eat my porridge. After that, everything was perfect, so I chalked it up to a first-time rust on the account of the service. I had a pair of jeans laundered while I was there, and they were returned the same day cleaned and in great shape. I also utilized the Service Express feature throughought my stay, and it was efficient and friendly.

Overall, this is a fantastic hotel in the heart of Dublin, close to major tourist sites and many excellent restaurants. I'll be back in another month or so when business takes me to Dublin again.",5,2017,04,12
202,Returned to DUB after 35 years !,This Hotel was Lovely and perfectly located in Dublin. Staff was professional and the cellar pub was fun!Located directly across the street from the Temple Bar area and just down the street from Trinity College. Ideal !,5,2017,04,10
202,Beautiful Hotel in a Prime Location,"We stayed here for four nights at the start of a three week trip across Ireland, Northern Ireland, Scotland, and England.  The hotel is stunning.  My birthday happened to coincide with this stay, so I was upgraded to a huge room on the top floor overlooking the green at Trinity College.  The employees were helpful, courteous, professional, and detail oriented.  The facility is impressive, comprised of three historic buildings, one of which was a bank.  The basement level bar is in a former vault.  Food and drink were noteworthy, but it was really the service that set this property apart.  I would highly recommend staying here.  Bedding was perfect, the bathroom huge, and the services extensive.",5,2017,04,10
202,Last Night Delight,"We can't say enough about the wonderful staff and friendliness at The Westin. After spending a week traveling the beautiful countyside, we could not have asked for a better way to end our trip.  Great location and great service!",5,2017,04,10
202,Brilliant hen,"Went for afternoon tea in the Atrium Lounge for my hen party. Interior is lovely, afternoon tea was great. We had a cocktail making session in the mint bar then. This was really entertaining. The barman was good fun and we got to make our own cocktail and then he made 3 other taster cocktails from the menu. I'd highly recommend this. Will definitely return! ",5,2017,04,09
202,Excellent hotel. Great location. Expect to pay for it.,"I'm not a big luxury hotel person, so I won't comment on any expectations the hotel may set along those lines.  I stayed here while on business and likely would have gone for something less expensive had I not been at the same hotel with other people from work.

The hotel was fantastic.  The room satisfied all of the things I must have for a good hotel:
- The bed and pillows were comfortable.  The pillows, frankly, should have satisfied pretty much everyone since they provided not only so many, but also differing levels of firmness.
- The room was quiet and spacious.  It was a good environment to do my work from when I was working from the hotel room.
- The bathroom was definitely on the luxurious side of things including both a tub and a shower.
- The room was *dark* when the blinds were closed.

I failed to make it into the fitness center after checking it out.  It included a few treadmills and a simple cable machine.  However, it also had two weight benches with dumbbells going up to 60lb, which is almost unheard of in my trips.  Most seem to stop at 30lb. :-)

The location is what kept me here for my personal day after work was concluded.  The venue is pretty much directly across from Trinity College (Book of Kells exhibit) and a short walk from all of the downtown core, including the touristy Temple Bar district.  Pretty much my entire walking itinerary for tourist stuff was easy to center out of this location.

The wifi was quirky here, manifesting issues where my phone or laptop would work in one spot of the hotel but not another.  The front desk found me a workaround though.

That said, I'm thrilled at not being the one responsible for the bulk of the bill.  I'm typically satisfied with much simpler.",5,2017,04,09
202,City Center,"We had a relatively nice stay at the Westin Dublin, but I would not consider it a 5 star property. After an overnight flight, we arrived in Dublin at about 10 in the morning and took a taxi directly to the hotel. Our reserved rooms were ready and we were able to check into our rooms at that time. That was great! The heat did not work in the room that I shared with a friend and we reported it to the front desk in the afternoon. A portable heater was left in our room while we were at dinner that evening. The portable heater did not warm the room either. Other than that, the room was nice. The beds were comfortable and the hotel was quiet. The location is great for exploring Dublin by foot.",4,2017,04,08
202,A luxurious treat!,"I'll start this off by saying that hands down this is now my favorite Dublin city centre hotel. I visit a few times a year for business, usually a 2 day trip, and over the years have stayed in a variety of hotels in the area. The Westin for me really has shown off the best the brand has to offer. The rooms felt either recently renovated or very well maintained, with a very comfortable bed, decent linen, a well stocked and luxurious feeling bathroom, and strong wifi. Whilst I didn't dine in the restaurant at all, I did order room service and found it to be spot on. Club sandwiches will rarely be a gastronomic treat but they are easy to get very wrong, and their's was spot on! All of the staff were amazingly friendly, and the front desk team couldn't do enough to help me when I had a room query. I also enjoyed my morning and evening banter with the doorman, always greeting me with a smile and a welcome, and happy to share tips to save me getting lost.  Well done, staying here was indeed a treat that I look forward to repeating.",5,2017,04,06
202,Did not deliver 5-star service,"The Westin Dublin calls itself a ""luxury 5 star"" hotel but I was so disappointed. Don't get me wrong -- I really liked the location and the facilities, and the staff is pleasant and friendly. But it definitely fell short of luxury hotel standards when it came to service.

I won't write down a whole litany of complaints (and trust me, there were so many missteps during my one-week stay), but these are the major problems that i had with this hotel:

- Housekeeping did a very poor job cleaning our room. One example: I accidentally dropped a clean fork on the floor under the desk one night but didn't get to pick it up because I got distracted by my daughter. I didn't notice it again until the next evening. By then, I had already noticed how bad housekeeping was, so I left it there to see how long it would stay there. It didn't get picked up until 4 whole days later! I could give a few more examples of such poor service by housekeeping, but I'll leave it at one.

- One staff member knocked on our door despite the hanging ""Do Not Disturb"" sign. We were sleeping!

- The doorman was either nowhere in sight or outside chit-chatting with someone half the time. This might not be a big deal to most guests, but it's frustrating for those who have their hands full (like my husband and I when we arrived) or those pushing a stroller (like we always were) or those who are in a wheel chair or crutches. Luxury hotels that I've stayed in always had a doorman or two in duty ready to help. Always.

Like I said, there are some good qualities at the Westin like location and facilities, but don't expect it to be a ""luxury 5 star"" hotel.",3,2017,04,04
202,'When is a city view room not a city view room ...?',"Westin Hotels have an extremely good name. I have stayed in several in different European cities and, without exception, they have not disappointed. It was therefore with a considerable degree of confidence that I booked a two-night stay in the Westin in Dublin using the SPG advance rate. There is much to commend this hotel. It has a central location.  Breakfasts are excellent, and the restaurant staff polite, efficient and helpful.

My dissatisfaction relates to the misleading way in which the hotel describes and sells some of its rooms. I had booked a city view room, and this was confirmed in the email received from the hotel at the time of booking. However, as the photo attached to this review testifies, the room we were allocated on check-in could, in no way, be described as 'city view'. All that could be seen from the window were the tiles of a roof which was adjacent to it! When I checked with the receptionist whether we had been allocated the correct room, she confirmed that this was indeed one of their deluxe city view rooms. When I expressed surprise at this, she admitted that she could see why I was disappointed, and that this was not the first time that a guest had complained about this.

The following morning the hotel offered to move us to a room which did have a city view (and also to give us lunch and a 10% refund on our rate). Given that we were only there for two nights, and had already unpacked, we opted to stay where we were. 

Later that day I spoke to the manager about why the hotel was selling rooms with no view as city view rooms. He was not able to provide a satisfactory answer, and could only defend this practice by saying that other 5-star hotels in the city do the same. Even if this is the case, it is no excuse for Westin to mislead its guests in this way. In our conversation he was keen to move away from the general issue to provide some sort of compensation. Given that I didn't want to move rooms, we agreed on a 25% discount on the first night's rate, and 15% on the second.

The manager agreed to look into the way in which the hotel is selling these 'city view' rooms. At present, it would appear to be pot-luck whether a guest will be allocated one of these at check-in or not.

My advice to anyone thinking of staying in a city view room at the Dublin Westin is to contact the hotel in advance for written confirmation that you will indeed get what you pay for. At present there is no guarantee that this will be the case. On my next visit to Dublin, I'll be looking to stay elsewhere.",1,2017,04,04
202,Lovely hotel,"Terrific location & great service. Short walking distances to pubs, restaurants, shopping, Temple Bar, Trinity College & the river. Room was clean, beds very comfortable and bathroom was huge. Had afternoon tea in the Atrium. There were 3 of us and it was very relaxing and elegant. We tried the gin mojitos in the teapot & which were quite potent. We each ordered our own tiered selection of treats and honestly it was too much. We would have been better off with ordering two and sharing. They do box up the extra food for you if you wish. Lots of construction going on near the hotel with the tram line revisions. Fortunately we were not disturbed by any noise from it.",5,2017,03,28
202,"Excellent location, very good service","Located a block from Temple Bar, and a short walk to Trinity College and National Museum. Also is 2 blocks from airport shuttle (air coach that picks up on the bridge).
Hotel room had all the Westin bells and whistles, great sheets, bed, bathroom amenities.
Located nearby are pubs and Starbucks, and good food . Even the Post office is a short walk.
Concierge was enthusiastic and very helpful about how to take day trip to Belfast, and offered lots of tour options.

Bar downstairs was decent and had a wonderful selection of food for us that are not meat eaters. Fish and chips, flights of whiskey tasting cocktails. It's just that service was slow, and the atmosphere lacking.

While we were staying there there was drilling on the street which woke us up at 11:30 PM, and while it is  not the hotels fault, ...if I had known, I would have asked for a room on another side. 
",4,2017,03,26
202,Central location,"One of the best things about this hotel is it's location. It's very central just short walking distance there is Temple bar area and the shopping streets and the river. Our room had also the view to Trinity College. The rooms were nicely decorated and clean.
The front desk personnel very professional and always present.
In the evenings they had very nice live music in the hotel bar.
Would definitely go back to this hotel.",5,2017,03,24
202,Relaxing atmosphere,"I was in for afternoon tea yesterday at 2. The young waitress on at this time was incredible. 
We had a few dietary requests and these were well received. I treated my sister to our afternoon in the Westin and we both left extremely happy. 
I loved how quiet and relaxing the whole experience in the Atrium was.
Great service, fabulous setting and delicious food.",5,2017,03,22
202,Fit in afternoon tea here!!,I was pleasantly surprised by both the interior and service at The Westin when I went for afternoon tea with a group of friends. The area that they have afternoon tea is called 'The Atrium Lounge' and it's beautiful. The food was really nice and we didn't feel rushed at all. Compared to other hotels in Dublin this one is one of the better especially price wise for the quality of their afternoon tea so I would recommend fitting it in if your just visiting or making it a regular occurrence if your from Dublin.,5,2017,03,19
202,Exclellent Hotel,"This was one of the best business hotels I have stayed in during my travelling career, it was clean, well located, fantastic service, fresh food, and just the best smelling hotel when you walked in. The staff were excellent and so helpful. I would strongly recommend this hotel for business. The rooms were excellent also.",5,2017,03,19
202,Fantastic.,"I stayed in the Westin Hotel with my female friends. Everything about this hotel is fabulous  from the moment you walk in through the doors.  Reception staff were friendly and efficient. Our room looked out to the courtyard with its comfortable seating and lovely bar. It is a classy hotel and beautiful.  We didn't have dinner there. However we did have breakfast,  it was lovely and again friendly,  efficient staff. It is expensive to stay at this hotel and drinks from the bar area also expensive but it is worth it.",5,2017,03,18
202,Excellent,"We stayed in room 213 which is directly over the main entrance on Westmoreland Street. It is also almost directly opposite Fleet Street which becomes Temple Bar. Westmoreland Street becomes O'Connell Street on the other side of the bridge a few hundred yards away. Basically the location of this hotel cannot be beaten. Right in the centre surrounded by literally hundreds on bars and restaurants and all the sights, shopping etc. The hotel took our car at the door and valet parked it so that we could enjoy our four day business trip/holiday without worry. The hotel has all the amenities you would expect of a world class establishment and service was second to none. I left my laptop charger in my room and one email later it was being couriered to me back to blighty. Thanks Daragh Hickey, Concierge! We shall return.",5,2017,03,17
202,"Great Hotel, Great Location","Whenever possible, I book at the Westin.  Sometimes the rates are pretty competitive if you are flexible with your plans.  The location can't be beat, the hotel is beautiful, and the staff are friendly and welcoming.  Don't miss a meal or drink in the Mint bar downstairs.  The hotel is located in an old, ornate bank building.",5,2017,03,15
202,Expensive for what it is,"Lovely location (even though currently a mess with the tram rails) and a nice building. As so often with nice old buildings, the rooms are a bit meh. I particularly have an issue with the WIFI. Despite getting assistance it simply would not work in my room, i had to go walk out to the hallway to get a signal, very annoying. mini bar is a joke, almost nothing in it. Finally, I was super unimpressed that after a day my room was not made at all. Apparently choosing 'green option' is not just not getting new towels (which I am fine with) but it is also not getting any service whatsoever, not even straightening your bed Not acceptable for a 5* in my opinion",3,2017,03,15
202,Peacesful But lose Enough to Party,"This was a quick 2 night trip to Dublin to see the fabulous Elbow at the Olympia Theatre.
The hotel was perfectly positioned for day and night trips along Temple Bar and access to the main pubs and restaurants.  There were a lot of road works outside the hotel when I was there but this actually made crossing the road fairly easy.  I got the bus from the airport to the hotel and missed the stop because the one I should have got off at was closed and a temporary one had been set up near the bridge before the hotel, little did I know.  I got a taxi back to the airport on leaving day for 24 Euros and that was much easier.  
The Westin was as you might expect from this chain of hotels, clean, friendly, efficient and so on.  The room was spacious and overlooked the atrium restaurant where mostly women sat (on the day I arrived) taking time out for a bit of Afternoon Tea . The room was also extremely quiet due to its location centrally within the hotel. 
There is nightclub in the lower ground part of the hotel which was fairly busy on the Saturday night.  
I love the oysters washed down with old style room temperature Guinness.  Gogarty's was particular good for this experience.  Although, beware...the Jameson's whiskey is expensive!",4,2017,03,14
202,Afternoon tea,"Had the adventurous choice of afternoon tea, which came with mojito in a tea pot. Was absolutely amazing, the whole experience including the service. Another pot of mojito was only a tenner too. I'd recommend bringing one of the slices of cake home with you or you'd be too full for the day.",5,2017,03,14
202,Efficient Location + Pretty Rooms,"My first hotel in Dublin, it was a great place to start my trip. 

Location: Very Centrally located. It's across the street from Trinity college + Book of Kells. About a 20 minute walk/ 10 minute taxi ride to Guinness. 5 minute walk to the temple bar area. 

Hotel + Service: I love the smell when you first walk into the hotel. Very classic decor. The service was impeccable. When we arrived, our room wasn't ready yet. They offered us another room but the front desk told us that our room was worth the wait. So we dropped off our luggage and went down the street to the Bank for brunch. The concierge was also very helpful with helping us book tickets + their recommendations. 

Room: We were in a room on the 4th floor with a balcony overlooking the city. The room was a good size, perfect for 2 people. It might be a little tight for 3 people. I really loved the balcony + the view. 
The beds were definitely heavenly, especially after a long day of walking. Sheets were clean! 
The only con was the city noise which you could hear with all windows closed, also you can hear wind noises which can get pretty loud. 

Bathroom: Decently sized. The shower had great water pressure + towels were soft. The hair dryer is in the closet. 

Food: We had breakfast in their restaurant and it was really good. They also have afternoon tea. It was busy both days we were there, so I would highly recommend reservations.",4,2017,03,13
202,Great location and staff.,"Regardless of what takes you to Dublin the Westin is in a great location for food, fun, sights, and transportation.  The staff was very welcoming and gave great advice on getting around.  Very safe area and felt comfortable the whole time.  Rooms were comfortable but the way the place is laid out you can walk a decent distance to your room and up and down a step level in between so if distance or steps are an issue ask to be close to the elevator.

Buses - You can catch the AirLink 747 from the airport and get dropped off within a block walk of the hotel. Round trip will cost you $20E or less. Easy to catch the 747 back to the airport by walking out of the hotel going to crosswalk on the left and going across.  After you get across go left and follow the walk around until you get to the bus stop area.  Tour buses can also be caught from this area.  I took the Dublin Green Hop On Off with two routes and felt like it was worth it.  You can take a taxi to and from the airport easily but make sure you stop at an ATM and grab some Euros prior to the trip.  I did not and the cab driver charged me way too much for using dollars.

Food - The hotel is right across the street from the Temple Bar area and the area is huge with restaurants all over.  The Boxty was close as was ONeils, both were great. Boxty is down Fleet Street on the right, Oneils is on the corner of Suffolk and Church.
After getting across the street there is a nice grocery within 75 yards of the hotel down Fleet Street.

Step outside your box.  Eat the lamb, drink the porter, and make some friends!",4,2017,03,13
202,Wonderful Hotel and Best City Location,Our first visit to Dublin was spectacular.We stayed at the Westin Dublin at College Green. I would highly recommend this hotel. The service and staff are excellent and very hospitable. Dublin is very easy to navigate and the advice from all staff at the hotel was terrific. We would definitely book this hotel again. We were given a spacious room in a quiet location.One word of advice don't use a 3rd party travel arm to book your travel like American Express . Book direct with the hotel to take full of advantage of the SPG program. We were misled by American Express on this program and later learned they do not honor all components of the program. All in all we would return to this wonderful country of Ireland.,5,2017,03,12
202,Afternoon tea amazing! ,Came to the westin for afternoon tea as part of my hen weekend in Dublin. What a lovely relaxing afternoon. We could stay at the table even longer as luckily it wasn't booked for the next seating. All the staff are very helpful and knowledgable of the area. Afternoon tea was amazing! Even boxed up left overs. Thank you for a lovely afternoon!  ,5,2017,03,11
202,Excellent hotel and perfect location.,"Stayed three nights and chose the Westin as we were SPG platinum members at the time and the hotel is centrally located near much of the key sites we were interested in touring. Trinity College and the Book of Kells are just around the corner, Temple Bar,  St. Stephen's Green, Dublin Castle, the Guinness Brewery and of course THE St. Patrick's Cathedral! are all a short walk away.
The hotel itself is quite attractive, our room spacious and nicely furnished and the staff service oriented. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay.",5,2017,03,10
202,Elegence in Ireland,"My wife and I stayed here for a total four nights over two weekends as we toured Ireland during the week. This is a beautiful hotel with a tremendous staff in possibly the best location in Dublin. The hotel rooms are nicely appointed and a good size for European hotels. The d√©cor and architecture are quite beautiful and the views from the rooms are inspiring and relaxing. There is a tremendous pub in the basement of the hotel that provides a unique ambiance that is quite different than the pubs in Dublin. It has a cave like feel as if you're in on a secret bar that only a few people know about. The cocktails are top notch, this is not a place you want to have a Guinness... these are top end bartenders and you should take advantage. Needless to say, its a great place to start the day or end the night... or both. I have stayed in A LOT of hotels and this is in my top five. You will not be disappointed and it is worth every dime you spend.",5,2017,03,10
202,Tea with a twist!,"The Atrium Lounge at the Westin Hotel Dublin was the spot my sister and I decided on, to celebrate her birthday. Booking it was easy, and recommended as it can get very busy.
On arrival we were greeted by a young vibrant friendly Dublin girl (which was so nice to see), who explained the different options to us regarding the tea. We decided on the ""A Most Peculiar Afternoon Tea"" ..and wow was it peculiar. It was aesthetically pleasing on the eye. The tea pot, cup and saucer were so pretty. The most exciting part? It wasn't tea, but the most delicious Mojito I think I have ever tried. Gin, fresh mint, lime and apple juice!! 
The food without a doubt, was something I will rave about to anyone who will listen. Three tiers loaded with goodies, all of which was as fabulous and decedent as the next. My favorite would have to be the Crayfish in a charcoal wafer cone, which I wished would last forever!! and the salmon with wasabi caviar on a beetroot cracker. I am a savory lover, so this was perfect. 
The desert was also amazing with the mini tea cup being my favorite. From start to finish the experience was second to none.
The surroundings, comfortable seating, fresh white linen, natural daylight and friendly ambiance were fabulous. My only complaint was that it had to end. A thoroughly enjoyable tea!",5,2017,03,06
202,You need to stay here while in Dublin,"Fantastic hotel-from a product/service/location perspective its everything one looks for in a hotel. Staff was really really off the charts helpful-each point of engagement was better than the next.

Dublin is under a ton of construction however the hotel itself was spotless.

Only part of hotel that wasn‚Äôt excellent was lobby level restaurant (mint bar downstairs was excellent) 

Doormen were the best I‚Äôve encountered in many years-each time we stopped to ask information is was an experience in and of itself!  Sometimes you forget how hotels were run back in the day-this place reminds you.",5,2017,03,06
202,Friendliest hotel with a real Irish charm,"My 25-year old daughter and I spent 5 days at the Westin Dublin and we loved everything about it. From the antique furnishings and welcoming fire in the lobby fireplace on our arrival, the unbelievably friendly staff who run it all so professionally, to the spacious double room with its lovely decor and very large marble bathroom (it had both a bathtub and shower). 

Everything was impeccably clean and new paint, furniture all shiny while the style was classic antiques, nicely done. For business, I've now stayed at 4 different hotels in Dublin when the Westin wasn't available, nothing came close. The other hotels of the same price have nicely trained staff but it's more impersonal professionalism, and the rooms could be rooms anywhere in the world. 

At the Westin, the staff greet you so warmly and take such a friendly interest in your day and provide for your every need. (Super concierge service!) The lovely room antiques remind you you're in Ireland, we upgraded to a deluxe double for an extra ‚Ç¨20 per day, really worth it for the spacious room we got with 2 double beds. 

There's a large bar in the basement called the Mint - we went on Saturday night after dinner, there was a really good cover band whose female lead singer had a great voice, it was very full of lively people and had a busy full bar with several bartenders. (You can't hear anything from the bar on the ground floor or above.)

Finally, the location is perfect - just near Trinity College and facing Temple Bar. Try it, you'll love it!",5,2017,03,05
202,A Most Peculiar Afternoon Tea,"Wow!  Heard about this from our Uber driver and had to check it out: so glad we did!  We started our vacation with afternoon tea at the Savoy in London, finished our trip with A Most Peculiar Afternoon Tea at the Westin, Dublin.  Things could not have been more perfect!

The tea and food were wonderful.  The ""tea"" was a gin ""mojito"", which was perfectly balanced, nicely fruity and minty, and looked just like tea from the pot and in the cup.  The food was exquisite, the only thing I would have changed would have been a little bit more of the savoury bites, and a little less of the sweet bites.  Fantastic combinations.

Wonderful.",5,2017,03,04
202,"Your Hotel mini bar, lets your see into the future, and what a can of beer will cost in 2025","A pleasant hotel, reasonable rooms, at unreasonable prices, right in the centre of Dublin, with all its  late night high speed Police siren wailing high speed duties, sometimes being in the middle of a city, is not a good idea at 4am, no complaints with the restaurant food excellent, the large lobby with its wide open spaces, and artful touches a delight to sit a drink a refreshment of your choice,  Temple Bar just across the street from the hotel were the bars are wild, and also matched by their prices. Try both hotel and Temple Bar for a weekend, your credit card company wiii love you forever, and see you in a new light , Derek a true Dub",3,2017,03,03
202,"Great service, construction right now in fromt","Great service all around and a really nice hotel. The biggest drawback was the construction noise happening in the street right outside my window...all night. Nothing the hotel can do about it but didn't make sleeping very easy. I believe some of the other rooms do not face directly out to the street and at least until that's done would make that request. 

Short walk to the Luas tram down some beautiful and charming streets. Beautiful sites and great food all around. The 20 min commute to my office was well worth it, would stay here again. ",4,2017,03,03
202,We just come back from a long weekend,"To star with I will say that the hotel looks very nice, clean enough, rooms not two big for a doble luxery, every thing was ok, until the night arrive, now the problem start, the noise for the ventilations in the bathroom was horrendus, so, I call recepci√≥n to try to short it out, they couldnt, the manager on call pop up to the room and she said if we have the air con on, wich we were not, she was nice but couldnt short it out the problem, she offer us another room, and after all day travelling I said we do it tomorrow morning, all night with the HUMMING in the room, and like this for the 3 night that we spend there, IS THE VENTILARON IN THIS HOTEL, not just the bathroom but in the room as well, staff kind enough but not be able to do ANYTHING AT ALL, they offer us ear plugs and 2 bottles of wine. VERY DESAPOINTED.  Especialy when you pay 500 EUROS A NIGHT,

I WILL NOT BE BACK, AND I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS HOTEL TO ANYBODY.

I CAN ONLY THINK THAT THIS HOTEL HAS THE 5 STARS FOR THE GENTLEMAN AT THE DOOR, OPEN IT FOR CLIENTS. END",2,2017,02,27
202,Not consistent - 2nd stay was disappointing,"This was our second visit here and it was a very different experience to our first stay.  For one, check in was painful and prolonged.  The lady assisting us was a trainee except there was no-one with her to train her.  She kept apologizing for the delay and was basically guessing her way through the process.  Our stay was also paid in full upfront, which I had to remind the lady when she requested payment from us.

Nonetheless, we finally checked into our room, which was the SMALLEST room I have ever seen in my life.  There were two of us each traveling with our own large suitcase.  There was only room for one suitcase, and the other had to be placed where it blocked our path to the bathroom.

Also, the TV stand in front of the bed was so close to the bed itself, that the doors didn‚Äôt fully open, making it difficult to access the bar fridge within.  You had to strategically position yourself to be able to gain access.  I am sorry, but for the price we paid for the Westin, and the service and standard we have come to expect from Westin hotels, well this was not worth the money at all, and very much below standard.

We were very pleased with our first stay, and disappointed with our second‚Ä¶ I guess this is a bit of a hit and miss hotel, perhaps worth trying somewhere else where there is a little more consistency.",3,2017,02,26
202,Flawless From Start to Finish,"I don't have a single bad thing to say about this hotel. The rooms are spacious and well appointed; service was friendly and genuine; and location was top notch. I took a detour to Iceland before returning back for a final night and the hotel stored my bags without an issue. They accommodated my very early return and were able to check me back in well ahead of the regular check-in time. These gestures went above and beyond and would definitely be reasons I would return. There is lots of construction going on in the area, though, so hopefully next time it won't be as much of a construction zone. Otherwise, it was perfect!",5,2017,02,24
202,Such a friendly hotel...so welcoming,"Absolutely first class in all respects. Having stayed in many 'Starwood' properties over the years, none of them ever warranting a really poor rating, the Westin Dublin will rate at the top most end of my experiences for some time to come...I really can't criticise any aspect of our stay there. A uniformly happy and welcoming team who would go out of their way to ensure that all was well...special mention of Mo on the concierge desk, he was so helpful on a number of occasions.
Food and drink was excellent, super breakfasts were offered to us at a discounted rate (which I will admit did help sell them to us) but I defy you to leave hungry. A very wide ranging buffet, to which you could add perfectly cooked poached and fried eggs, lovely local smoked salmon, Irish soda bread...etc. The 'Mint' bar suited us well for food and drink in the evening, not too expensive and well presented, good range of local and international beers. We ate in Temple Bar on a couple of evenings...try the 'Boxty' for local stews, very tasty and filling, we had the three stew sampler at 20‚Ç¨.
Bedrooms are fine, very comfortable bed, refreshing hot drench shower, wide range of TV channels with plenty of sport and fast free wifi. There are alot of road works at the moment while the new tram lines are being laid, this causes noise through the day but the rooms are well sound proofed. The hotel is difficult to get at with congestion throughout the day well into the evening...taxi is the best option from the airport.
We stayed for a week which obviously included a weekend...Dublin is great in the week, everything you hope it will be. As for the weekend, notably Friday night, avoid! Need I say more.",5,2017,02,23
202,Great Hotel in Great Location,Had a very short work trip over the pond to Dublin and found this hotel to be a wise selection. It was located in the heart of Dublin where all the action is. Very good restaurants and pubs circle the hotel.,5,2017,02,23
202,One overlooked detail in an otherwise perfect stay,"Everything about this hotel is great - prime location, friendly service, good breakfasts, and bathrooms that carry nice soaps and other essentials. The internet worked flawlessly, and the room provided different sockets for my different chargers. The only flaw I could find was a big one for me: the pillow cases were too small for the pillows, and the ""open"" end of the duvet was placed at the top of the bed, meaning that my face was often buried into a bit of pillow that never gets washed, and some parts of my body was kept warm by a similarly stained and used blanket.",4,2017,02,20
202,Relax in a bit of heaven,"Tend to stay in Starwood hotels where & when possible around the world as I'm a member of their loyalty programme & know the standard I should expect from their respective brands. 
The Westin Hotel, Dublin is a 5 star hotel and rooms aren't cheap with prices ranging up from ‚Ç¨400 per night, but you can certainly see where money has been spent within the decor of the hotel & with each room.
Rooms are very luxurious & the 'heavenly' bed is amazing- you actually want to go to bed to experience a really good night's sleep despite the hotel being located close to Temple Bar and its associated nightlife, plus & a few minutes walk from O'Connell bridge/ street and Grafton Street. In fact the hotel really is in the City centre.
Staff are very welcoming on arrival & will try to help if you have a request- in my dealings with Kate & Sandra from a business perspective they have both been excellent & extremely helpful. 
A really good hotel & an excuse to treat yourself' or that someone special/ special occasion as although rooms are in the more expensive bracket, they're worth it & you won't be disappointed.

202,"Amazing Service, and one of the best services I received in Westin hotel lines.","the hotel staff at this Westin Hotel make sure to take the extra mile to make you feel comfortable and feel just at home. Rooms are extremely clean, and beds are  one of the best features of the hotel.",5,2017,02,18
202,Great location. well appointed,"The Westin is a 10 min walk to Grafton Street and Molly Maguire, and 2 minutes to Trinity College. You can also walk up 10 mins to McConnell street if you need more shopping to the Ilac mall area. the hotel itself is quiet, with great beds and pillows. sound proofing is adequate. not exactly 100%, but keeps most of the street noise out. The rooms have coffee/tea, and bottled water is provided free, as is the WiFi.  There are a lot of eating options in the area for Thai, Chinese, and of course Irish fare. There are 2 Indian restaurants about 15 mins walk away on William Street. Souvenirs can be bought on Grafton Street.",4,2017,02,16
202,"Pricey, but well worth it !!!","This hotel is expensive compared to my usual bill but it is worth it. Its got a touch of posh but isn't in any way pretentious or intimidating to stay in. The room is nice and the bed was extremely comfy. Also the bathroom had a bath and a shower and came equipped with bath robes. The only reason this hotel didn't get 5 stars was that the bath was as small as they come. If your anything over 5'5"" then use the shower. 
  They have a lovely lounge/bar where you can relax in a beautiful area drinking tea/coffee etc whilst on your laptop. 
 Last thing is the location. Your no more than 20mins walk from most things. 
Well worth a visit. ",4,2017,02,16
202,Lovely hotel,"We stay here at this time of year when dining at the Greenhouse on a special Saturday.  

The hotel is impeccably maintained. Very comfortable. 
Atrium restaurant is generally packed with girlie afternoon tea parties on Saturdays but lively with it. 
This is however the real daytime lounge so not much else - the bar is in the basement so more an evening place. 
It does really come alive on Saturday evening with good bar bAnds. Great to come back from a nice meal and get rid of the coat, settle down to some good drinks and absorb the atmosphere - without having to stick the nose out into the cold night again. ",4,2017,02,13
202,Spectacular visit - five stars!,"We had a wonderful stay at the Westin Dublin. The entire staff was very very professional, warm, friendly, and extremely helpful. My nine-year-old and I were there for three days and could not have been happier! We very much benefited from a front desk staff and the concierge who were exceedingly helpful regarding our very many requests. We particularly loved breakfast and dinner! Many of the rooms are named after famous Irish writers, which was lovely. Are only suggestions would be to create even more lights in the rooms and in the hallways.",5,2017,02,13
202,Perfect,"We stayed here for two nights at the start of February for my birthday. My husband noted this in the booking. Upon checking in we were advised of a free room upgrade to a queen with a view. We were upgraded to a bedroom overlooking Trinity College! The check in service was amazing. Room wasn't on paper meant to be ready until 3pm but we were at the hotel at 10am and given our room key and access to room. When we returned later on from some lunch and sightseeing a 'happy birthday' mini cake had been left for me which was a lovely touch!
The location of the hotel is amazing...Right beside trinity college, only minutes away from temple bar area, O'Connell Street etc. Stop 8 for the green bus tour is 2 minutes walk from the hotel entrance which was ideal to get to all other attractions which were further out.
We had breakfast in the hotel on our second morning which was ‚Ç¨17 each. We were both like children in a sweet shop...This was, hands down, the best breakfast we have both ever had! The selection was amazing and the food decadent. Wish I could eat like that every morning!!! 
The hotel is just lovely....Staff fantastic...Location perfect. I hope we can return one day. Thank you for a memorable stay! ",5,2017,02,12
202,Almost perfect,"We visited Dublin as a treat for my daughter's 18th.  The Westin is in the perfect location for tourists - across the road from Temple Bar and 2 minutes walk from Grafton Street.

On arrival the door staff helped with our luggage and were friendly without over-imposing.  Reception staff were great - for reasons I won't go into here my booking was for 2 doubles instead of one twin and one double.  Reception found us a twin with a double close by for my son.  The rooms were ready so they allowed us to drop our luggage which was so helpful.

We didn't end up eating in the hotel so I can't comment on food.  Afternoon tea in the Atrium was packed out the one time we thought we would try.  We went down to the bar for a drink instead, prices pretty rich even for central Dublin and the barman seemed very stretched.

The rooms were lovely, clean and very comfortable.  Only 2 small niggles - I was slightly disappointed not to have a separate walk-in shower and the screen didn't stop water flooding the floor, plus it was incredibly warm in the room even after adjusting the air-conditioning.   If we had been staying more than 2 nights I would have asked for someone to look at it, but in the overall scheme of things these were small issues.

All the staff we had to deal with were friendly and courteous.  I would definitely stay here again if back in Dublin.  We stayed at the Westin Times Square a couple of years ago and all of us much preferred the Dublin hotel.",5,2017,02,10
202,"Fantastic location, excellent service","Being in a hotel for only 24 hours isn't usually enough time to make a decision.  It was here.  The front desk staff was professional and efficient, check in was a breeze and my request for a quiet room was granted with a smile. The room was clean and the bed super comfortable.  Large beautiful bathroom with shower AND an amazing tub.  So amazing that I bought a bath bomb from the Lush Cosmetics down the street and had a soak. The Westin is steps away from Trinity College, Temple Bar just a block or two away, The Bridge at O'Connell street (perfect for sunset watching) the monuments and the GPO all within a very short walk.  As well as some of the prettiest parks in Dublin.  All of which the concierge directed me too with ease.  After my soak, I decided on dinner at the Mint Bar.  The gentlemen behind the bar were just that, perfect gentlemen.  The food was delicious and piping hot.  Even when another person at the bar began to act very rudely toward the bartender (he wasn't a guest of the hotel), they maintained their cool and continued to provide top notch service with a smile. Even checking on my comfort after the rude man had left to be sure I wasn't bothered by him as I was traveling alone.  I know where I'll be staying my next trip to Dublin.",4,2017,02,08
202,"Perfect Location, Beautiful Hotel","We absolutely loved The Westin Dublin. Our room was cozy (not huge, but comfortable) and had a nice view of the city. The staff was all very kind and attentive, very akin to the Westin hotels in the states. The hotel also had an amazing breakfast each morning with fresh off the comb honey. 

The best part about this hotel by far is the location. We walked to St. Patrick's Cathedral, Dublin Castle, The Arcade, and really everywhere!",5,2017,02,07
202,Perfect location for exploring Dublin,"Sitting a block from Trinity College, two blocks from Temple Bar and just around the corner from Grafton Street, the Westin Dublin is the place to stay.  Started each day with the buffet breakfast offered on premise in the the Exchange Restaurant. Good selection of Irish breakfast items, breads, fruits and eggs or pancakes for special order.  The Mint Bar in the basement level had a nice selection and live music on Saturday evening during my stay. ",4,2017,02,07
202,Excellent Hotel,"Located in a superb area of the city. Hotel staff was very friendly and attentive. Traveled as a group of 10 booking 5 rooms. Only issue was those of us in rooms that overlooked the atrium/lounge (3 separate rooms) were extremely hot in the middle of the night. The thermostat was set at the lowest temperature, yet each of the 3 rooms was stifling. Hopefully this was a temporary glitch and won't be an issue for anyone in the future. Despite this, the hotel is lovely and I would still book this hotel in the future.",4,2017,02,07
202,Consistently good,"Although we hadn't stayed here for a while the staff were as attentive as ever and the standard of the accommodation was simply superb.
It isn't the cheapest hotel in Dublin by any means, but the location and the comfort make it worth it.
You should give it a try.",5,2017,02,06
202,"Great hotel, amazing location,","Had the pleasure of two nights at the Westin this week!  It has a great location in downtown, a block from the river.  Staff was great - awesome breakfast buffet - and if you pre-reserve you get it at a discounted priced of 17e.  The bartenders in the basement bar were also great - friendly, sense of humor, and very helpful.   Overall a very good experience and I WILL return next year - and hope to stay longer.",5,2017,02,05
202,5 stars review for a 5 star hotel,"The location is just perfect for a weekend in Dublin. Actually, it couldn't be better located. The staff is so friendly and caring. The rooms aren't big but very luxurious, marble bathroom with bath and shower. Cocktail bar was lovely too, very very good cocktails! Cannot fault anything.",5,2017,02,04
202,Almost wonderful,"The hotel is very cozy despite the fact that it is luxurious at the same time. Room was clean and comfortable, furniture is new and very qualitative! Location is fantastic, everything is close! The staff in the hotel is very hospitable and everybody is ready to help immediatelly! There were one small issue: in the morning (rather earlly morning) lady comes to check minibar! We were sleeping when she khoked the door and ask to enter. it is strange for such expensive and high level hotel... In all other respects it is good and I recommend to stay in this hotel when you are in Dublin!",4,2017,02,02
202,Wonderfully welcoming,"Like other Westin properties, DUBLIN's is top-notch. Smart, smiling, ever-helpful staff. An easy place to go to-and-from all over the city. Clean, quiet, historic. As an SPG member, I found it superb.",5,2017,01,27
202,A most delicious afternoon tea ,"Had the ""most peculiar afternoon tea"" recently and it was delicious and wonderful    
Three tiers of delicious savoury and sweet treats all washed down with their ""Victorian mojito"" cocktail. Service was polite but unobtrusive and the room was comfortable with a nice buzz but not too noisy. 
We booked for afternoon tea but ended up spending 5 hours chatting, enjoying the ambience and drinking g&t's which to be honest is a lovely way to spend a January afternoon. 
It was expensive but I was spending a gift card that I'd received as a present. It was a fabulous treat and it's an experience I'd definitely do again. 
My only criticism (which is about afternoon tea in general rather than this specific one) is that I'd prefer more savoury treats and fewer sweet options. 
Toilets were spotless with lovely soap and hand cream. ",5,2017,01,22
202,Simply Terrific ,"My wife, daughter and I spent two fabulous nights at the Westin in Dublin and frankly I don't have a bad word to say. From the doorman to the front desk and restaurant staff the level of service was tremendous. 

The hotel is modern, clean and inviting. You won't be disappointed if you stay here. ",5,2017,01,22
202,Charmingly peculliar,"I have stayed in this hotel more than 10 times but hesitated in reviewing it because of all the constructions going on. Now that the constructions are almost over, finally I can write a fair review. Many other reviewers have already commented on the great location of this hotel, for leisure and business travelers alike. On top of all that this hotel also has its own character because it used to be a bank. Some of its ""peculiar"" arrangement can be charming and no two rooms are the same, makes you wonder how that space was once used many centuries ago.",5,2017,01,21
202,"Great hotel,great location.",First time in Dublin and this hotel ticks lots of boxes. Situated virtually next to Trinity College and 5 mins from Temple bar and the shopping area too. Lovely rooms and very friendly staff this is a nice relaxing place to stay. Reccomend it.,4,2017,01,20
202,Afternoon Tea,Afternoon Tea in the Atrium of the Westin Hotel was a delightful experience. Wellcoming staff explained the menu and the choices available. Two of us opted for the traditional menu while our friend choose the Peculiar option with a gin based cocktail served in a tea pot.The only downside was that we had to leave the hotel and go home.,5,2017,01,17
202,Perfect location,"This is a great location, central to many of the sights of Dublin.  Perfect walking distance to Temple Bar area, Trinity College, Dublin Castle, Christchurch, St. Patrick's, Stephens Green, and  Grafton Street.  The room was clean and cozy, though not much of a view.  ",4,2017,01,17
202,Afternoon Tea at The Atrium Lounge ,"All i can say is WOW! This is the second Afternoon Tea ive had and it will be extremely hard to beat! I am a coeliac and got the GF afternoon tea and it was amazing! Each and every bite tastes so good and they packed the leftovers for us. The Atrium is stunning, has such a beautiful ambiance. Staff are great, they are experts in this field of work. Im sure it is the best Afternoon tea in Dublin if not Ireland.

 Only negative thing is i got charged for a tea? Did not think you would be restricted to one hot beverage?  
",5,2017,01,13
202,Great location,"The Westin is in a great location.  The airport buses and local buses are right across the street.  The staff was friendly, especially the doormen.  The room we had was clean, comfortable and spacious enough.  The bed was very comfortable and easy to fall asleep in.  Our room faced the street and was on the second floor but it was quiet.  We had no noise issues whatsoever.  The lobby of the Westin was nice but may be too small for the hotel. Every time we wanted to sit there, there was no room.  The Mint Bar on the lower level was very nice and had lots of seats.  I didn't give 5 stars as I felt the bathroom should have been updated.  There are two Starbucks close by and a grocery store only five minutes from the hotel.",4,2017,01,11
202,Great staff,"Lovely hotel. Perfect location...having taken train and Luas there. Absolutely wonderful , warm & friendly staff. Lovely big bed rooms. Great breakfast . Only downside is lack of big public areas. Atrium is lovely, but small and hotel better served to open up adjoining room .",5,2017,01,08
202,"Wonderful hotel, fabulous staff, fabulous food","Absolutely loved our stay. We went for my husbands birthday. Agnes at reception was wonderful and arranged an early check in for us, the concierge (all three of them who helped us plan our trip) were knowledgeable and could not have been more helpful. We had breakfast and afternoon tea in the beautiful atrium and both were wonderful. We had we years dinner in the exchange restaurant both of which were delicious. The staff were polite and friendly without being intrusive and the room was lovely. Would definitely stay again. Easy to get around Dublin on foot and recommend the Guinness factory for 1/2 day - the Guinness flight taster was lovely. Wonderful ambiance at the Oliver St John Grogarty pub - great authentic food and beer!",5,2017,01,07
202,"Good location, lovely hotel but expensive","We stayed at the Westin for 3 nights in the week before Christmas. The hotel was beautifully decorated, the room was very nice and the staff looked after us well. The location is great for exploring the city, with plenty of buses stopping just outside. 
But whilst the bar/restaurant, afternoon tea and breakfast were nice, it was all very expensive (17 Euro for cooked breakfast) even in comparison to other places close by.",3,2017,01,06
202,Great Hotel,"My husband and I stayed here for 4 nights over New Years.  The rooms were clean, the beds were comfortable, the staff were friendly, and the hotel was very well located.  We thought the food/drinks at the hotel were overpriced, but we walked down the street to some of the many restaurants/pubs.  Over all, I recommend this hotel.",4,2017,01,05
202,Great central location!,We went to Dublin for a quick 3 days over New Years and selected the Westin and were very happy with our choice. The location is great. Located across from Trinity College it is very close to the Temple Bar and shopping districts. Guinness is less than a 15 minute walk. We even walked back from Kilmainham Gaol (25 - 30 minutes). A cab from the airport is about $24 euros. The rooms are quite large and the beds beyond comfortable. The walls are a bit thin but only noticed the last night because of a VERY loud family. The staff were extremely nice and helpful. We enjoyed drinks in the Mint Bar. I would definitely choose the Westin again if I return to Dublin.,5,2017,01,05
202,Lovely stay in a centrally located top drawer hotel,Stayed over the week of New Year's.  The hotel was immaculate and the staff where very hospitable.  My wife and daughter had never been to Ireland before and the location made it very easy to see the sites and come back to the hotel whenever it was convenient.  The staff was always very attentive and very helpful.  The food was superb.  All in all a very pleasant stay.,5,2017,01,05
202,Grand stay at the Westin,"Spent a few days at the Westin Dublin Hotel. It really is a classy hotel worthy of 5 stars. Wonderful facilities, great dining and friendly, professional, efficient staff sets it apart. It is perfectly located in the heart of the city within walking distance from most major attractions. 

We had amazing service from the concierge, Kenneth, in particular who made our stay that much more memorable.

Highly recommended!",5,2017,01,05
202,New Year at The Westin,"I was here again as part of a wedding party. Father of the groom. As always, this Westin is from the very top drawer and one of the very best hotels in Dublin. The new Luas tracks have opened up the front of the building to render a majestic frontage.
Check in and room were efficient. Stephen the doorman as cheerful as ever.

My first time in the banqueting hall which is a fabulous room befitting the venue. Mass catered food alas is only average, but adequate.  I will be back !",5,2017,01,05
202,Great location,"My family of 8 stayed at the Westin Dublin over Thanksgiving. While not my first visit to Dublin, it was most of my family's first time and the Westin Dublin made it so memorable. Situated in the city center near the Liffey, my family was able to easily walk to tourist attractions, restaurants, pubs, and shops. Just a quick walk from Trinity College, Temple Bar, Grafton Street, etc. We were celebrating a special occasion and the hotel staff made our visit even more special. Highly recommend!",5,2017,01,03
202,New Year in Style,"We have just returned home after 3 fabulous nights staying at the Westin Hotel Dublin. From arrival to departure we could not fault the staff and the atmosphere of the hotel. The classic room was superb, huge room which was well appointed, heavenly bed, bath and walk in shower and even a coffee machine, ideal for 2 coffee holics. We celebrated New Year's Eve in the hotel after seeing the special meal they were holding. Six courses and a glass of champagne followed by live music in the Mint Bar.  The breakfast was amazing. So much choice to suit every taste. We used the Mint bar each evening, good choice of meals and drinks including cocktails. The Westin is ideally located in Dublin. Very central, close to Temple Bar, Grafton Street and the Liffey. We will definitely return.",5,2017,01,03
202,Wonderful !!!!,"I stayed at the Westin in Dublin on the last two nights of our trips at the end of December. The hotel itself is gorgeous, pristine and clean. We were offered an upgrade to a king suit for 25 euros-- what a bargain! The room was gorgeous, fantastic views, and the bathroom is unreal. It is probably the best bathroom I have ever seen--truly a five star experience. Hotel staff was amazing--very professional and helpful. I had a personal problem and the hotel management was extreamly helpful in getting my issue resolved--truly great management and great staff. I highly recommend this hotel-- its located right by all the shopping and bars/restaurants. Really a great experience and I will definitely choose this hotel again when i return.",5,2017,01,03
202,Updated Review,"I'm a frequent visitor to this hotel and the recent stay Dec 18-20,2016 was not up to usual standards.  We really enjoyed our room,It was spacious and vowed well laid out Bed was comfy and we slept very well.  Bathroom was spacious also. Service at breakfast was not good enough for the price they charge.  Ordered poached eggs and waited 15 minutes, when hey arrived they were hard boiled eggs, we had to wait another 15 minutes.  On the day of our late 4 pm check-out ,about 3.30 pm we had a knock at the door, it was the maid asking if we were leaving soon , i told her we had late check out and she said she will be waiting outside our room.  I was shocked and couldn't believe she was actually saying that, but to even more shock and horror , when we were leaving our room at 4 pm, she was actually still standing outside our door and I felt a huge invasion of our 
privacy in a way. As SPG Lifetime gold and loyal customer, our future visits to the Westin Dublin are in serious doubt!!",4,2017,01,03
202,Afternoon tea,"This is a treat as it's ‚Ç¨36pp for silver service afternoon tea. You must have a reservation as it's in demand. The atrium is lovely and bright with very comfortable tables and couches. 
Tea is served at table with tiers of sandwiches, scones, cakes and miniature desserts. 
You may have unlimited tea or coffee.
Our son was able to have an a la carte option and my husband was accommodated with a no fish option. Our server was very attentive.
Highly recommend as a family treat.",4,2017,01,02
202,"Great location, great Christmas atmosphere","We have been staying at the Westin Dublin every Christmas week for the last 5 years. The hotel location is second to none, close to landmarks like Trinity College, busy Grafton Street and Temple Bar. The Christmas decoration and overall feel of the hotel make it a great place to enjoy the Christmas buzz in Dublin.
But this year we also want to recognize a significant improvement in the level of service and staff reactivity. All our requests were fulfilled rapidly, the staff was very helpful and friendlier than during some of our previous stays there.
We will definitely be back next year.
",5,2017,01,02
202,Great location,"Stayed here in May 2016, kicking off our Ireland trip to drive the country. The location is fantastic. We were upgraded (SPG platinum) to an awesome room with a balcony. It was too cold to be out there for long in rainy May, but it was still lovely to have a tea or coffee there when dry. 
The staff was very helpful and pointed us in some great directions for snacks and dinner.
Great rates for the location and quality of the hotel.",5,2016,12,31
202,Top notch stay over Christmas ,"The hotel is historic and beautiful in general, but was especially lovely decked out with all of the Christmas decorations. We stayed here on Christmas Eve and Christmas Day and everything about it was top notch. Every one we met was warm and welcoming in every way, they had roaring fire places with gorgeously decorated trees everywhere and really made it feel homey. The Mint Bar and the Exchange Restaurant were both great and it was very helpful that they stayed open when most other places were closed over the holidays. Our stay here really couldn't have been better. ",5,2016,12,31
202,Short but Lovely Stay,"My sister and I stayed here after a quick 2 day tour to Galway.  We were very pleased with our room.  The bathroom was huge and well appointed.  The hotel is located right across the street from an Airport Shuttle stop.  Extremely convenient.  They offered a special on their breakfast, since they couldn't accommodate our room needs.  This was not necessary, but above and beyond as far as service.  We enjoyed the remainder of our evening in their signature bar The Mint.  Now that was a GLORIOUS experience.  The food, cocktails and service was wonderful.  Neither my sister nor I are big on hotel live bands, but the entertainment here was first rate.  We ended our short trip to Ireland in one of the most splendid ways.  Good food, adult beverages and very friendly people.  We will stay here again!",5,2016,12,28
202,Fantastic hotel with perfect location,"Excellent hotel - great understated and subtle service from staff, perfect location for exploring Dublin both day and night, and only 20-30 mins from the airport. 
After a day exploring the city, the rooms are decent sized, spotlessly clean with large well appointed bathroom with a bath and a separate shower. 
Food and bars are good - but there is so much on your doorstep here, it would be shame not to get out and explore. 
Have stayed here 3 times in 6 months. My new Dublin favourite. 
",5,2016,12,28
202,Awesome service and best location,"This Westin is at the heart of Dublin.  We couldn't have chosen a better located hotel with the best amenities and best services.   The staff service is the best of all - very helpful, friendly and always ready to assist.",5,2016,12,28
202,Another Great stay,"As always, the Westin Dublin was a wonderful experience.  The Staff are very nice and the rooms are lovely.  There was a bit of a wait with the checkin, so they gave us a complimentary cocktail at the Mint Bar.  Looking forward to going back.",5,2016,12,28
202,5 Star Christmas Shopping,"My husband and I came to Dublin for a Christmas Shopping weekend break. The Westin hotel was fabulous and we spent our weekend on the doorstep to the city. 

The hotel is quaint and full of atmosphere; we dined in the Mint Bar and the Atrium Lounge. Breakfast was served until noon on both days so there was no rush to get up early. The hotel staff are full of charm and were very warm and hospitable I just can't wait to do back.",5,2016,12,24
202,A Most Peculiar Vegetarian Afternoon Tea,"We visited the Atrium in the Westin for Afternoon tea for my aunt's birthday yesterday and I must say I was not at all disappointed! Firstly, the Atrium was beautifully decorated, with an open fire burning. We were immediately welcomed by the staff who were very patient with us and accommodating as we had 2 less people than we had booked for so asked if we could take a smaller table at a sofa rather than a large dining table. They promptly cleared a sofa table for us and we went there. Myself and my sister are veggie and were astounded to see that not only did they have a vegetarian afternoon tea menu, but they had TWO! We ended up going for one of each of the four options (Festive afternoon tea, A most peculiar afternoon tea and the veggie versions of each) and shared. The food was incredible. My particular favourites were the blue cheese and guacamole cones, the pecan scone with clotted cream and jam with strawberry bits in it, the salted caramel popcorn and the brownie (to die for!). We had so much we ended up taking some of the sweets home with us to share with our two who couldnt come with us due to sickness. The Most Peculiar tea came with a Victorian Mojito made with Hendricks gin and served in the most beautiful teapot and teacup set. 
My aunt absolutely loved it, it was a spectacular treat! The ambience was beautiful and the staff attentive and friendly. I couldn't fault it on a single thing, and my sister and I were really impressed with the vegetarian menus (normally places just take away the meat leaving you with boring egg mayo!)
Highly recommended, not cheap but well worth what we paid.",5,2016,12,23
202,Cozy hotel in the heart of Dublin,"I've stayed at the Westin Dublin on several occasions for business travel. It's a reliable, traditional hotel. Some of the rooms have excellent views over the rooftops of Dublin and nearby Trinity College. I enjoyed the large breakfast spread in the mornings. Overall, this is a comfortable luxury hotel in an excellent location.",5,2016,12,22
202,Westin Dublin is a bullseye in all respects,"A classic hotel in the best senses of the word. Unbeatable location within walking, driving, and bussing distance of everything you'd travel to Dublin to see. The building is beautiful, and the public spaces are attractive, welcoming and immaculate. The Atrium should be considered a Dublin hidden gem, and is a wonderful space to hang out, eat and/or drink at any time of day. The staff ties the entire operation together and is both available, informative and professional but also friendly and not overbearing. Friendly welcomes we're around every corner, but we never had the need to call upon anyone because all spaces, public and room-side, were perfectly outfitted at all times. The hotel works like a well oiled machine, and it impressed us how a place with such a large interior could be kept as nicely as it was yet we never actually laid eyes on anyone cleaning it, let alone hearing a vacuum or cleaning operations. This is also a reflection of the area, and Dublin in general, which will draw you out of even the nicest of hotels. Get tea, a hot whiskey, or Irish coffee from the Atrium. Drink around the block at Bowes, Palace Bar. and nearby Gallaher & Co. Bistro has great food & drinks, but is also BYOB.",5,2016,12,21
202,Perfect Location for a Long Weekend,"I stayed at the Westin Dublin a few weeks ago and could not fault it. Easy check-in and the receptionist even helped to create and link an SPG Account with my existing Marriott Rewards account.
The Hotel itself has well-equipped rooms, including USB charging ports and both UK and EU plug sockets. The breakfast was of good quality and room service was fairly priced, and the bar had good vibes in the evening. The absolute best thing of this hotel though is the location, it is absolutely in the centre of Dublin and we only had to take a taxi once all weekend (to Kilmanhaim) because everything was in walking distance. Overall I would 100% stay again should I return to Dublin!",5,2016,12,21
202,Nice corner room.,"Stayed in the hotel with a family of 6 adults.  Place was great for adults, downstairs basement bar was trendy and a perfect spot to gather before heading out to diner.  The room was clean and spacious, but a little warm.",4,2016,12,20
202,Treated with love!,Westin Dublin didn't disappoint! Staff was happy to accommodate our need for an early check in. Lobby bar needs an upgrade but club bar was amazing! If your looking for something close to bars/restaurants this is a great spot!,4,2016,12,19
202,Best location,"Would return simply based on location, but all around great hotel. Great rooms with a lot of character. My husband and I booked a room with two twin beds due to availability (sounded unusual by American standards), but they were really double beds, so we were pleasantly surprised. Perfect for walking to bars and restaurants! ",5,2016,12,18
202,Great Location in Dublin,"Stayed 3 nights at this property. Everything was up to par for a Westin. Had a room on 2nd floor that faced an office building across the street.

Room was larger than usual for a European hotel. Bathroom was quite large, All bedding was clean and very comfortable.

Ambiance throughout was marvelous.

Bar in basement called ""The Mint"" is a great place to hangout for drinks and bar food. The bar food menu could be expanded somewhat. The nights we were there it seemed as if the table server was either real busy or did not feel like coming around to our table too often, Service could have been better with some extra and timely attention.

What I liked the best was the hotels central location to many places of interest in Dublin, Walking distance to many places to see, eat or drink.

Will stay there again",5,2016,12,16
202,Bliss,"Lovely central hotel.
Immaculately clean and tastefully furnished 
Very welcoming helpful & friendly staff.
Plenty of dining options available..nice cosy large rooms with all the necessary utilities
Devils in the details.",5,2016,12,16
202,"Great staff and service, lovely place!","I spent 6 nights in the Westin and have to say it's a lovely and comfortable place. Especially their staff is great. They're attentive, polite, helpful and will always greet you with a smile. Breakfast is a real treat with absolutely anything you can think off available. I made use of the gym several times, it's small but sufficient and the only thing not so great there would be the ventilation. My room was on the top floor and truly comfortable with a great bed and pillows (important!!) and a luxerious bathroom. Absolutely the only thing you can hold against the Westin Dublin is the noise coming from the works around the hotel at the moment. So if you sleep light make sure you have a room on the top floors and at the back. Conclusion: enjoyed my stay and will come back but will check if there's still works going on!",4,2016,12,15
202,"Loud and noisy room, bad food which makes you ill and bad service","Recently I travelled to Dublin to attend a conference and visit the city.
For two nights I stayed in The Westin hotel - which I shouldn't have done.

As a SPG Platinum member I got upgraded to a suite - quite nice but also quite strange. The suite spanned over two floors but the window was in the middle of the two floors - so it was rather dark the whole day.
The bed was as I expected in a Westin hotel and the living room / library was quite nice.

But unfortunately that was everything which was nice.

As I wanted to make use of my room, I ordered food from the room service. I decided to take the ""catch of the day"" or a burger. Unfortunately the ""catch of the day"" was already out - but therefore the personnel recommended me to take the fish platter.
I was quite hungry that day as I skipped breakfast and so I didn't really inspect the food but trusted the hotel.

After I finished my food I felt quite tired and went to sleep. But unfortunately there was loud dance music till 4 am - and around 2 am I felt really sick. I went to the rest room where I had to use the toilet several time. It stand like hell - rotten fish. And still I couldn't sleep because of the noise.
The next day I went to the front desk - but they couldn't help me. Despite telling me that I was the only one who ate that fish platter they didn't provide any useful service. They just told me that I would have to pay 250 ‚Ç¨ for a doctor to come - as there was no doctor in Dublin and one would have to come from Dundrum.
I declined and went to the breakfast room to get some tea. But there was a long queue - two many guests maybe.
After waiting for more than ten minutes, I finally got a table and ordered peppermint tea and chamomile tea. Another ten minutes later I got some English breakfast tea because the service personnel had already forgotten my order.

The second night was not as noisy as the first night - but still too much music to sleep well. I also tried breakfast a second time - this time I got the tea as I ordered it.
I also wanted to eat something and took a donut - but this almost cracked my teeth as it was as hard as stone.

As I stayed sick for almost two weeks I complained at Starwood about the horrible experience in this hotel.
But they didn't really recognise my complaint - instead they told me that there had been six more persons who ate this fish platter and didn't feel sick at all. So I wonder, why they had not found these people when I was talking to the reception woman...",2,2016,12,14
202,Kind Staff and Ample Services,My girlfriend and I spent a weekend in the hotel and found all the staff to be very friendly. We were greeted at the door and brought to reception to check in. The room was very spacious and clean. The bathroom was beautiful with a walk shower. The bed was comfortable and there was little noise at night. We booked afternoon tea for two and received a complementary 2 for 1 deal as the food was slightly delayed. Very luxorious hotel.,5,2016,12,14
202,"Outstanding service, perfect location","I don't know how our stay could have been any better and we will definitely stay here again.  Our room was lovely and quiet, the service from top to bottom at the hotel was perfect and the location is just where you want to be for all of thr pedestrian areas.   Our room was ready very early for us, we got late check out with SPG gold and the windows even opened a bit.   A very well kept hotel!  Next time we head back to Dublin, we know exactly where we will stay.  Thank you to the hotel for making our stay in Dublin so pleasant.",5,2016,12,14
202,"An American Hotel, be warned","Anyone wanting strict security and an emphasis on ""wellness"" will feel at home here. Not a mellow Irish experience. Starting with reception, which checks for impostors taking someone's prepaid reservation, by requiring the credit card used for the booking as proof of identity. Also vigilant anti counterfeit protocol for changing currency. The room itself was very comfortable, clean and quiet. Good bedding. ""Wellness hints and menu choices prominently displayed. A very high end sanatorium experience ! Herbal tea priced to match! TheMint bar in the lower level is good for a light evenng meal, wine well priced by the glass. Except for reception snafu, typical Irish good manners. A follow on survey detailing my dismay at my initial introduction was met with a concerned response from the duty manager. So one may take The Westin virtues/ flaws with a cultural grain of salt !",3,2016,12,11
202,Excellent Hotel,"My wife and I stayed here for two nights.  The room was quite large, a welcomed surprise in Europe to be sure!  The hotel is nice, an old converted bank which they pay homage to perfectly with the names of their bars and event spaces (The Exchange, The Mint, etc.).

The service was great, check-in experience was seamless and efficient.  The rooms were very clean and furnished well as you come to expect of an SPG property.

The location is great.  Walking distance to the Temple Bar district and many shopping, dining and drinking spots but quiet in the evening for a peaceful sleep!  

We will not hesitate to stay here again in the future.",4,2016,12,08
202,"Friendly service in a perfect spot wtih clean, well appointed rooms.",This hotel is in a perfect location for a Dublin visit.  We were here for a weekend and it was ideal for easy walking access to a lot of Dublin's highlights.  We were put in the Yeats suite which was lovely.  Front desk staff was very friendly and accommodating.  The bathrooms are clean and well stocked and everything is as you'd expect from a top flight Westin.  Take the green 747 bus from Dublin airport and it drops off just around the corner from the hotel.  A return fare is only 11 Euro.  Tour buses pick up around the corner as well.,5,2016,12,07
202,Exceptional ,The hotel it's self Is in a stunning location on the south side of town. I went in for dinner. The food was the very tasty and lived up to expectations ‚úåüèªÔ∏è the service was slow and it was hard to get waiters attention. Otherwise the ambiance was lovely with appropriate decor. ,5,2016,12,06
202,Ireland trip,"The hotel is beautiful. The rooms are classy and comfortable.  We had a room facing Trinity college. The noise from outside was minimal however, the room doors when left to shut alone make the the neighboring room shake.  We were awoken by noisy room next door. We also ate at the Mint bar downstairs assuming it would be quick since there was hardly anyone there.  Food was ok.",4,2016,12,06
202,Best Location in Town,"Stayed 2 nights on points as SPG 100 Night Platinum member (13500 points per night).  Was upgraded to a balcony room 504 which was much appreciated.  Asked for early check in at 11 am and it was approved prior to arrival.

We flew into Dublin airport and took the 747 Bus and was dropped off at College Green stop.  The ride took about 35-40 minutes and the stop is announced.  We paid for a round trip ticket on the bus for 10 euros per person.  You get off about 1 block or so from the hotel.  The pick up for the 747 is across the street.

As a platinum benefit, we chose the breakfast in the Exchange Restaurant which was really good.  Pastries were high quality and eggs can be cooked to order on request.

We also tried the Atrium for afternoon tea - you should book ahead and call for reservations.

In general, service at this hotel is exceptional - from the breakfast dining to the bell man who is always there at the front door.  When I called to request items as we chose Green Choice, everything arrived quickly.

The room was a good size and the bathroom could probably do with a renovation because the flooring and caulking looks worn.  On the other hand, the bed was really comfy.

WIFI was complimentary for me and no complaints there.

The location of the Westin Dublin cannot be beat.  You are within 5-10 minutes of Trinity College, Temple Bar and all the other sights we visited.

I would not hesitate to stay here again.",5,2016,12,05
202,Great hotel!!,"Great stay, all the staff were very friendly and helpful, Good location near the main sights of tourists sights of Dublin. Hotel has a central atrium which has a great lounge for Afternoon Tea or a quiet drink.",5,2016,12,04
202,Fabulous Hotel,This hotel is fabulous!  It is in a great location.  You are in the center of all the hot spots.  Service is awesome!!  The front desk staff is super friendly.  The young lady that checked us in went above and beyond to make us feel welcomed.  The hotel is clean and the housekeeping staff was amazing.  I was very impressed with this hotel and I'm so glad we chose to stay here.,5,2016,11,30
202,First class hotel with great location,"The staff and public spaces are both first class.  The rooms are comfortable with the Heavenly beds your used to in the states.  The location is central to all, with Trinity College across the street and Grafton St. just a block away.  Will stay here again.",5,2016,11,30
202,"good location, pleasant hotel","The Westin is centrally located and is a nice hotel. The rooms are quite big, and have decent wardrobe space. I liked the cocktail bar vey much (who doesn't? ;)) and the atrium was a pleasant place to work as well. The gym is not that big, but has what you need I suppose. Nice staff, nice fireplaces, I'd go back. :)",4,2016,11,28
202,Great hotel and even better location,"We stayed in room 118 from Nov 16th - 22nd and it was great.  Cab was about 27 Euros and we were lucky to have a room available when we arrived around 10am.  The staff were all amazing and I cannot recommend the concierge service enough.  Check in was very easy and overall we had a great stay.  

The location is really what makes this hotel special.  You are steps away from Temple Bar and not far from shopping, the Guinness brewery, churches, museums, etc.   Very walkable city.

We had breakfast included and while it was fine, the dining room could get quite crowded and it seemed that sometimes they have trouble keeping everything stocked.   I am not sure if I would pay for the buffet but they had some nice a le carte options.  The people working the dining room were very friendly and welcoming.

If you feel like splurging, try the afternoon tea.  Again the staff were great and the treats were tasty.  

Overall great hotel and I would definitely go back and recommend to friends and family.",4,2016,11,28
202,"Our Go To Hotel, When in Dublin","My wife and recently spent two nights at the Westin Dublin.  We also stay our first night and last night in Ireland at the Westin Dublin.  It is a great way to rest up after the overnight flight from the states and also to get a good nights sleep before flying out early back to the USA.

The hotel is very centrally located in City Centre on College Green.  It is across the street from Trinity College and a quick 5 - 10 minute walk to the Grafton Street shopping district.  There are plenty of options for dining and drinking within a quick walk from the hotel.

We have always been treated well here.  They are always very helpful and glad to assist with any request you may have.  They also do a great job of providing upgrades to SPG Platinum members.  We have always gotten a nice suite during our stays.  They have some very nice suites, including some that are two story writing suites.  Very enjoyable.

The hotel has a nice bar in the basement with good food and drinks.  They also have a restaurant, as well as, afternoon tea.  We have done the afternoon tea on one occasion and it was very good.  Well worth the time and cost.

I would highly recommend this SPG property.  Great location, great staff and great service.

One thing to know is that this property is very busy, so if you are off an early flight and get to the hotel early, they may not have a room ready.  If not, they are quick to get one cleaned and ready for you.",4,2016,11,27
202,Nice location and superb services!!,"The hotel is located at a very convenient location, 5 mins away from Temple Bar and Trinity College, 10 mins away from the shopping area Grafton Street. The staffs there were very friendly and helpful!! Room was clean and nice but not very big. The only thing that is missing the star is the food. The food served at the hotel were very mediocre, breakfast was so-so and the 2 buffets we had during our conference were not very impressive.

Definitely will stay back at this hotel again, always fond of the SPG hotel!",4,2016,11,26
202,"Professional & Efficient, even with complaints!","Smallest room ever for the price! (Room 301, ‚Ç¨220 per night for room only!)
TV control poor - how does it switch on? Maintenance dept. could not fix it, so no TV for the first night. Surely a hotel of this size carries spare TVs and associated equipment?
Room temp - Low upon arrival, unwelcoming.
Toilet difficult to use, tight against the wash basin, certainly in this room it's an issue.
Noises loud from the corridor at 0600, uncaring Neighbours!
Exterior roadwork noises.
Reception handled the TV complaint in an efficient and professional manner by locating us to a new room and offering breakfast complementary the next morning, nice!
In the new room, 531, Shower drain was very smelly of sulphur. Room temperature was also cool/cold upon arrival but warmed up within 20 mins.
Breakfast tasty but dry, baked beans lacking from the selection of buffet choices. Tables left uncleared for long periods, which was the same complaint I had in my TripAdvisor report of 3 years ago!.
Overall a good hotel with professional service but in need of some detail attention in the areas noted above.",4,2016,11,26
202,"Great venue, in a great location. ","Very centrally located 5 star hotel in Dublin. The Exchange restaurant is worth a visit food was delicious. Staff are efficient and professional offering great service. 
I attended a conference in the banking hall a beautiful room which works well both as a work environment and as a sit down dinner venue. 
At all touch points this hotel was excellent. 
",4,2016,11,25
202,Great location!,"We stayed here for 6 nights using points.  It is located in a prime location next to Trinity College and Temple Bar.  Walking everywhere from this hotel was easy. Overall the hotel staff was very friendly, especially the front desk staff and the restaurant.  The staff at the Mint cocktail lounge was polite but not overly friendly.  They didn't go out of their way to engage in conversation.  The breakfast was okay.  We got it for free with our stay but it wouldn't have been worth it if we paid for it (19 Euros).  The room was nicely furnished with a desk area and large bathroom.  Our room faced the inside atrium and it was nice and quiet.  We enjoyed tea in the hotel one afternoon and it there was a lot of items to eat.  We actually took some with us back to the room.  I am not sure it was worth 24 Euros each but the atrium is a beautiful and comfortable seating area.  I would stay here again!",4,2016,11,24
202,Superb,"We recently stayed at Westin Dublin. Received early check in after overnight flight from the states. Room was quaint. No view, but typical Westin bed and linens. Great location for exploring the city. Bellman and reception extremely helpful. Went to Mint Bar one night. Started off with great service and then we were forgotten. A little disappointing. Breakfast buffet was good. I would definitely recommend this hotel to someone staying in Dublin.",5,2016,11,22
202,Great location,"Classic Westin property. It's located in an older classic building with all the charms. Great location near trinity college.  Staff are absolutely great.  Rooms are spacious for classic hotel. Didn't try the restaurants:

Will recommend:",5,2016,11,21
202,This is a real gem!,"I am rarely that impressed by Westin brand. Normally, Westins are nice, but not necessarily the best of SPG brand. This one is exception. Everything went as close to perfect as it gets.  Got good deal through SPG Cash+ Points program.  We stayed 2 nights on a short stopover in Dublin. Got acknowledged my Gold SPG status with early check-in and complimentary upgrade. I requested a quiet location. Word of advice: if you are sensitive to noise, request the room facing beautiful enclosed Atrium, rather than very noisy street.  They even serve Afternoon Tea in the Atrium/Courtyard.  Westin has all the right ingredients: very good central location, tasteful common areas, and lobby, cool bar downstairs, competent and friendly service, and of course gorgeous rooms with marble bathrooms, excellent bed, and nice furnishings.  Couldn't find any shortcomings, and I usually find faults with most of the hotels. Just read my other reviews!  Would love to be back there sooner, rather than later!",5,2016,11,19
202,Gorgeous hotel! Super staff,"From Kenneth at the concierge desk to George at the front desk and The Mint Bar crew, the staff is delightful! Thanks for making a beautiful stay even more enjoyable with your assistance and kindness. Location is also fabulous. Will be back. Highly recommend.",5,2016,11,16
202,Best location for a tourist week-end.,"Arriving from Dublin International airport, we used Airlink bus 747 direct to Green college stop next to the Westin hotel, a perfect center town location to visit main tourist spots like Trinity college with its famous old Library or Temple bar for shopping at walking distance and easy to reach from the Westin. The nice welcoming front desk lady explains us the hotel facilities when checking in with d√©tails booking for a discount rate breakfast the next day but then, the breakfast supervisor said we were not on the list and ask for a full rate buffet breakfast ! Of course, we never came back again for breakfast the rest of our 4 days stay at the Westin. But except this terrible mistake, the room was big enough and very well  equiped to accomodate our 4 days stay on first floor room 134, next to the gym and it apprears it was a big disabled room which was perfect for us with beautiful comfortable linens, big clean bathroom with bathtube even we prefer Italian shower. The nice building was a beautiful Victorian style one with Christmas decoration already settled and fire on chimney to warm up the atmosphere of the place which was really nice and the concierge did help us to find nice last minute restaurant to get dinner without any booking like the Farm in Dawson street which appears to be the perfect place to discover good traditional Irish food with best service staff. In conclusion, will say that no place is perfect round the world and the Westin makes no exception to my conclusion but it does not mean we will not come back again on our next trip to Dublin except we will wait until the street works for the new tram will be finished to enjoy walking safe and cool among stressless,pedestrians in Dublin Streets.",4,2016,11,15
202,Great Location ,Spend two nights here in November. The Westin name definitely lived up to expectations.  Bed was very comfortable and the all marble bathroom was well done. Check in staff were friendly and welcoming. Location could not be better. Your right in the temple bar district with lots of shops and pubs within a 5 minute walk.  ,5,2016,11,15
202,Beautiful hotel in a great location,"Very good experience.  Older hotel, but well remodeled.  Rooms were very comfortable, nice linens.  The staff was warm and helpful.

We ate breakfast at the restaurant in the hotel - the buffet is a nice mix of Irish foods as well as more traditional continental breakfast. 

The hotel is across the street from Trinity College, and surrounded by a lively city. Many good restaurants and bars within walking distance. Near the ""Dart"" light rail.",4,2016,11,14
202,Great hotel great location ,I enjoyed staying here a good bit. My room was large and very clean. The staff was efficient and nice enough. The Bar downstairs was fair but nothing to write home about. I will say however it was a large bar. In Europe I expect small rooms. This hotel felt large for this American. Gladly stay here again,4,2016,11,14
202,Wonderful Stay,"The Westin at College Green was a wonderful hotel.  The staff was very friendly and helpful with restaurant choices, etc.  The rooms are larger than most hotels in Europe, with lots of closet space and a huge well equipped bathroom.  The downstairs bar/restaurant was very good and had great entertainment.",5,2016,11,07
202,"Wonderful stay, I want to live there!","Beautiful traditional hotel with all the luxury of modern facilities. The staff were very warm and welcoming, both on reception and at The Mint Bar. Maggie in front desk was very helpful and I'm sorry I didn't get the name of the young girl and guy in the Mint Bar, but they were fab too. Food was superb at the mint bar, I would definitely recommend the beef cheeks! 

The room was fantastic, it overlooked the atrium which was spectacular. Hotel is very quiet considering you're in the city centre. 

Absolutely loved the speakers in the en-suite- singing in the shower, yes please! Would go back in a heartbeat. Thank you for a wonderful stay.",5,2016,11,07
202,Mini reunion with university friends from the Philippines ,I met up with my uni friends after three decades in Dublin and I booked my hotel at the Westin great choice. We had breakfast and dinner there for two days so we don't have to walk far and carry on reminiscing the good old days. I loved our stay the room was cosy and lovely and the breakfast was great. Loved it staff are friendly and helpful.,5,2016,11,07
202,Halloween Bank Holiday,"Love, love the Westin in Dublin. Ideally located near the Temple Bar area. Receptionist area was very welcoming and they were able to accommodate us with an early check in. We were given two adjoining rooms facing Trinity College. My favorite though was the breakfast! The food was displayed so nicely.  The serve the honey straight from the bee's honeycomb. The yogurt and oatmeal were placed in cute glass containers. We enjoyed our first night in Dublin.",5,2016,11,06
202,Great location ,The location was amazing.  We walked everywhere even Phoenix park!   Staff was very nice.   Check in and out was perfect.  Room was a great size.  Beautiful view of trinity college    Comfortable bed.  Didn't eat at the restaurant (only drinks at mint bar) so can't comment on food.  Used workout room which was perfect for my needs !   Would definitely return again if in Dublin and highly recommend.  ,5,2016,11,06
202,Excellent Stay,"As I start all reviews, please take a look and see how many hotels I've reviewed, I'm not a jaded one time traveler. I travel often and feel I have a good base to write a good overall review. Overall they do it right! This property with the Starwood/Marriott merger could easily be turned into a Ritz with a few upgrades. We stayed here twice both rooms were very well appointed. It has the classic heavenly bed. Toiletries were ehh but I suspect that will change with Marriott taking hold. I was very happy to see they have copied Fairmont and have started providing workout attire! ( I hope this is rolled out to most Marriott properties) sadly unlike Fairmont (which is free for guests w/ status) they change ‚Ç¨5. For your good customers this is bad nickel and diming (tacky).  The staff at this location was outstanding every single person we encountered was terrific and knew our names (very nice touch)  We had dinner once and it was great, I had a lamb burger which was OUTSTANDING!! Sadly morning buffet was lackluster. I think regular guests can prepay ‚Ç¨17 for it ( ours came with the room) it was not worth ‚Ç¨17 in the least. Eggs- GROSS! Sausage and bacon fatty and no flavor. 
I tried everything twice and wouldn't again. I stuck to the fruit and pasties. But if it wasn't included in my rate I would have likely walked down to Starbucks ( two doors down) and had breakfast. 
Overall this is a Westin that seems to have an identity. I've often remarked that the brand doesn't know what it is. Is it 5 star? ( it's not. Ritz) is it 4 star? ( it's better than Hyatt) it's really that middle child. Hopefully with Marriott. It will find its way or simply go away. This is nice hotel and I will totally stay here again when I return to Dublin. Cheers!",5,2016,11,03
202,Dublin with my sister Sue!,"Lovely Hotel,perfect location,very clean,fabulous staff. Lovely pub in the basement of the building. Directly across from Temple Bar. Very close to Trinity College. 5 minutes from a nice train station. ",5,2016,11,02
202,Beautiful stay,Awesome stay in a great property.  Central location.  Spacious room!  Service was slow at the breakfast restaurant.  Road construction is going on out front right now.  Check in was a breeze and the staff were so helpful with directions and recommendations.,5,2016,11,01
202,Two excellent nights before and after walking tour,"A lovely Westin just in the middle of everything.  Concierges are very helpful in helping to find one's way around.  Our room, both times, had a view of the Spire.  We were just down the street from Trinity College, St. Stephen's Green, Ha'Penny Bridge, Temple Bar all within walking distance.  Rooms are superb.  Never a wait for a taxi if you need to get to the Guinness Storehouse.  Hope to stay here again on the next visit to Dublin.",5,2016,11,01
202,Luxury,The last day of our trip to Ireland we spent in Dublin at the Westin Hotel downtown. Taking about luxury. Seeing that all of the centre was one construction zone we didn't know where to park. A doorman in costume told us to leave the car and luggage. He would see to it. What a way to finish a fabulous trip to a beautiful country.,5,2016,11,01
202,Very nice hotel,"Located in the center of the Dublin city, every attraction is walking distance from this hotel. The lobby is very cozy, specially the chairs next to the fireplace.
The breakfast buffet is delicious and the ambience inside the hotel is great. The place is decorated for the season ( Halloween weekend is when we visited.)
Check out some of the photos.",5,2016,10,29
202,Perfect trip!,"Excellent hotel and a really comfortable stay!

Highlights were the customer service (especially the doormen - but honestly I didn't meet anyone who I wouldn't rate as excellent), the bedroom was impressive with a big/ comfy bed, powerful shower and a couple of nice complementary treats. Also the breakfast was good with an impressive range and I would certainly recommend grabbing a cocktail in the downstairs bar (despite the limited range).

Improvements? In an effort to provide a balanced review... they were painting downstairs when we arrived - not major but I would suggest that when you're paying these prices that such work is done at nighttime. Our view was of a roof - better than an inside room for sure but I was surprised to not be able to see anything based on the room rate?

Overall - would I stay again? Absolutely, this is a great hotel in a fantastic location - even if you aren't staying, go and check out the bar.",5,2016,10,28
202,Great hotel in a great location!,The hotel was lovely. The staff was super courteous and extremely helpful!  I asked them to set up a little Birthday surprise for my best friend and they exceeded my expectations!  Overall it was a great stay and I would highly recommend the hotel! It was in walking distance of many awesome attractions and bars and everything you could possibly need!  ,5,2016,10,26
202,One of the better hotels in Dublin,The hotel has a great location right a cross from Dublin College. The rooms are average size but very comfortable. Wonderful patio and cafe is in the interior courtyard. Would definitely stay there again.,4,2016,10,26
202,"Great Location, Even better Staff!","The hotel was in a perfect location to walk to all areas of Dublin. Our stay was even more enjoyable due to the friendly and accommodating staff. We had an issue while traveling, which the staff handled for us. Gave us peace of mind. I highly recommend this hotel if you ever find yourself in Dublin. ",5,2016,10,24
202,Westin - Dublin - Great place for first time visitor,"Having never been to Dublin, this was a great hotel for a short stay.  I only had two days in Dublin and didn't want to risk staying in a bad hotel, so I went with Westin as a known brand despite it being on the more expensive range of Dublin hotels.  It's very nice inside (fire place in use, morning coffee in the lobby) and the rooms are clean and current.  The staff is very friendly.  The location is terrific - right next to Trinity College, right next to Dame Street (the main drag in city center), and a 5 minute walk to Temple Bar.  My only complaint is that the concierge wasn't terribly impressive and generally relies on touristy brochures for ideas... but that's not a big problem when you have resources like Trip Advisor.  So, for a first time visitor willing to spend some extra money, this is a great hotel. I didn't see any others where I thought to myself ""I should have stayed there.""",5,2016,10,23
202,Westin,"Our room was clean and the bed/pillows were good. Service all around was very good. The breakfast was very good bordering on excellent. Older building that has been nicely renovated near many downtown sites. We walked to several cathedrals and the main park from here. Overall, very good, but for the price and the Westin name, I did not think it was excellent overall.",4,2016,10,22
202,One of my favourite hotels.,"I attended a day course at Trinity College Dublin today, which started at 8.45am. Last night I stayed at the Dublin Westin, across the rather battered and bruised road from Trinity - they are digging central Dublin up again - and it did not disappoint  .

This was a work trip. I was tired, had in room dining and slept very well. 

Breakfast at 7.30am was very good, and a late check out was the icing on the cake.",5,2016,10,22
202,Good service and beautiful room,Stayed one night here and was upgraded to suit as I am starwood member. Suit was great and resturant food downstairs was good. Service was great all staff where helpful and polite. Would suggest staying here as ticked all the boxes.,5,2016,10,22
202,Great Hotel Centrally Located,"The Westin is centrally located directly across from Temple Bar and next to Trinity College. It is the best location and within walking distance to everything. The hotel is nicely appointed and very comfortable. In the street level restaurant, they offer a buffet breakfast which is rather substantive albeit a bit pricey but if you are a big breakfast eater go for it. There is a lunch/dinner/anytime restaurant and bar in the basement ‚Äì why it‚Äôs there with a huge restaurant street level is a mystery. Although the offerings are quite nice it‚Äôs in the dark basement.

The rooms and beds are extremely comfortable. Temperature control worked very well and since you can experience four seasons in a day while visiting Dublin, this is very important. We had a few issues; the light in the closet blew out and temperature gauge fell of the shower handle. One call to the front desk and they were instantly repaired. 
There were two major things going on in Dublin the weekend we were there; Open House Dublin and Dublin Theater Festival. The concierge knew nothing about these which I found VERY disappointing. 

All in, we found it a better than expected hotel experience.",4,2016,10,21
202,Brilliant service - even with the road works,"4 great nights here. Great room great staff and fantastic breakfast. Highly recommend. Positioned right in the heart of Dublin and close to temple bar, trinity and Grafton St. Loved it. The tram works outside are noisy but I guess they will be finished eventually. Great pub across the road. ",5,2016,10,21
202,Wonderful Property,"What a great property.  First of all the Irish Breakfast in the morning was great!  Complimentary to SPG Platinum's.  What a wonderful way to start the day.  They have ""the mint bar"" in the basement, which has great beers, drinks and sometimes live music.  Property is centrally located, and close to about anything you want to see in Ireland.",5,2016,10,18
202,Classy ,"This hotel just oozes class and I had s wonderful stay there. The location is perfect, the rooms are spacious, comfy and very clean & modern. The breakfast experience is top notch and the team are extremely friendly!  ",5,2016,10,18
202,Wonderful experience,I agree this is the best location for walking around and seeing all the sites. We had a basic one bed room but it ended up having a window that faced the College which was beautiful. The hotel itself is very quiet and great for sleeping. Had the buffet breakfast every morning which was amazing.  Any time we called for ice or room delivery it was very fast. I would recommend this hotel.,5,2016,10,17
202,Good Location,"As one might expect, the Westin Dublin has more of an American than an Irish flavor. The service was good, the room comfortable and well equipped but there is nothing in the room that speaks to Ireland or Irish culture. Stay here is you want the typical hotel experience and plan to find local culture and ambience elsewhere in Dublin. Location is good for exploring Dublin as most of the part of the city one would visit are accessible on foot.",4,2016,10,17
202,Always Impressed with the Westin Dublin,"I maintain that this is the best hotel in Dublin. While my very cheap, the amenities and service are by far the best I have seen in this city (and any other city for that fact).  

The doorman always remembers you and is extremely helpful.  Laslo is fantastic overseer of anything that needs to get down - and thank him for such great service.  The front desk staff is always so courteous and helpful, would like to thank Anne Marie especially for her great service.  Or room wasn't ready (we were upgraded to the Oscar Wilde suite) so she walked us to the Mint Bar and comp'ed our first drink while we waited.  Fantastic service. 

Room is very well appointed and bathrooms are very nice.  ",5,2016,10,17
202,Perfect central location ,"Easy check in. Allowed us to take the rooms early in the morning after an overnight flight. Concierge helpful in booking activities and restaurants. Our room overlooked the indoor atrium. Queens size bed always prefer a king but it was nice. Wanted to go to the gym and didn't bring gym clothes for 5 euro they brought me up gym clothes in under 20 minutes. Sneakers, shorts, and short although no sports bra!
Had drinks and listened to live music at mint bar on a Saturday night! ",4,2016,10,16
202,Nice hotel in great location,"The Westin is a nice hotel in a great location.  All the great shops, restaurants, and pubs in Temple Bar are footsteps away. Trinity College is also right there as well as shopping on Grafton. The hotel is grand in appearance both inside and out. Be aware that there is a massive rail construction project underway on the streets outside of the hotel, but this applies to the whole area, not just the hotel. I would say that the room itself was the weakest spot. I used SPG bonus points (12k/night) to book the room. I also have SPG Gold status as an Amex Platinum cardholder. The description in the booking was for a room with an atrium view. We asked for an upgraded room at check-in, but were told that none were available. Upgrades are always subject to availability so this was no big deal. When we got to the room they gave us we were shocked! It looked like a closet and didn't even have a window to look out of! There was barely even any room to walk around the bed. I called the front desk to inquire about getting a different room and was told that the atrium view was subject to availability although the reservation clearly stated it was for an atrium view and this wasn't an upgrade. Staff was understanding, able to find us another room and came to help us move right away. The new room was only a little bigger, but did have large windows with a nice view of the atrium. The room and furnishings were nothing special, but nice enough. The bed was a bit mushy, but comfy. The spacious bathroom was stunning done in marble with a large tub and separate walk-in shower.  The sound system had a speaker in the bathroom which was a nice touch. We decided to spoil ourselves and ordered Irish Breakfast room service which was amazing! I hadn't ordered a full room service meal like that before and was very impressed with the quality and generous portions. Overall, this was a good stay.  Again, location is the biggest selling point followed by the grand appearance inside and out. The service was also very good. I think if I had been a cash-paying customer I may have been a little less impressed as the rooms were going for $450/night at the time of booking. I think most folks who don't mind the price or are able to use points will be very pleased.",4,2016,10,16
202,Great location/Comfortable stay,"The Westin is in a great location, just a short walk from Trinity College. The only negative was the street work being done has the roads and walkways all torn up as the new tram line is going in throughout the city. This is no fault of the hotel, just be aware of it. Although there is a lot of work being done, we heard none of it from inside the hotel and from within our room. We stayed in a Deluxe room (room 334) and it was quite comfortable and clean. The breakfast buffet was good and very plentiful. This was a great stay in a perfect location for walking around a large part of downtown Dublin.",4,2016,10,16
202,Fantastic stay,Stayed at the hotel for 3 nights and it was everything you would expect from a prestigious brand like Westin. Checkin was smooth and friendly and I was greeted with a smile. Westin's heavenly bed is always a pleasure to sleep in and there was no noise in the room other from what you would expect at any hotel in the world. Will be back on my next visit to Dublin.,5,2016,10,13
202,Great for Families and Business,"I was worried at first that the hotel was not going to be up to standard being located next to Fleet Street, which is party capital along with Temple Bar on the weekends.  However, it felt more like an oasis when we entered.  It was quiet and well decorated.  Our room was perfect, we loved it!!  It is also close to the airport.  It took us 35 min from door to door.  However, note, if you have  a rental car, add 15 min, as you have to drop the car away from the airport and take a shuttle.

If you go out on Temple Bar, the Pubs close at midnight and then the Late Night joints open up, some are OK, some are strip clubs, and some are just raunchy and full of very drunk people.

The basement bar at the Westin is a must do!!",4,2016,10,12
202,A Review ,"Stayed from 10/7-10/11. The hotel has valet parking which was super useful for my husband and I who drove in from the airport and were planning to head to the country side after our city stay. It's very very central! Everything was within walking distance or a cheap taxi ride (that was needed to see the Guinness storehouse). It is a block from Trinity college and the book of Kells. We easily walked to Murphy's ice cream, Christ church and Dublin Castle as well. We never needed the car in the city. It is also central to the Temple Bar area and lots of tasty restaurants. We tried a different restaurant each night and none of them disappointed. The rooms are clean (but don't expect the house keeping to actually fleshing the bathroom much during daily up keep. The shower has great water pressure. The bed was plush and comfortable. The best part of the room was the sound seal - you don't ever hear any of the busy traffic below - and the room has amazing blackout drapes.   The staff were friendly. There isn't an ice machine but around 17:00 daily someone comes around offering ice buckets. I would definitely recommend if staying in Dublin. ",4,2016,10,11
202,Lovely Stay,"We just finished a three night stay at this hotel, and have only positive things to say! The hotel is a gorgeous, old building that has been beautifully restored. Our room was updated and yet had classic charm. I enjoyed a nice soak in the tub and lazy mornings in the comfortable bed. The bar was great at night for a drink and dinner. We also loved the breakfast in the mornings.. 

The hotel staff was really attentive and kind. My husband had left an item in our Amsterdam hotel and the desk staff helped him get the item shipped to our home in the US. The bellman and concierge were always pleasant and helpful. 

Lastly, we really enjoyed the location. There is a lot of street construction in the area, but we were close to all the attractions we wanted to see. We were always able to walk to a great meal or pub. The Tara St Station was also an easy walk- for our day trip to Howth.

This was truly a great experience from start to finish- we loved Ireland and can't wait to return!",5,2016,10,11
202,Perfect location!,"This is a very nice hotel with attentive staff and a perfect location. It is right near Trinity College, Temple Bar and not too far from St. Steven's Green. Although Dublin is a city that is not too big, this hotel makes it easy to walk to most places.",5,2016,10,10
202,"Charming hotel, great location","We stayed here for 5 nights. Requested a suite and was given a junior suite with a small balcony. It probably was the smallest suite I've ever stayed in. Regardless, it was charming. It is a non-smoking hotel except on the balcony someone had left a cigarette carton full of cigarette butts. Obviously cleaning does not apply out onto the balcony. The breakfast selection was decent, service was good. Concierge (especially Daragh!) was very amazing! The location is great; you can walk to Grafton, Temple Bar, and many other locations. Would definitely return.",4,2016,10,06
202,Great place! Wonderful service!,I arrived at the Westin Dublin very tired after a day at the airport. I was met with warmth and kindness. The fire place in the lobby was charming. The room was clean and had everything we needed. Each day it was cleaned and bathroom supplies refilled. The concierge took care of all the bookings. They were helpful and quick to provide great service. ,5,2016,10,05
202,Great central location,"I loved pretty much everything about this hotel. The rooms are clean and spacious. The staff at the restaurant and bar are really friendly and make you feel really at home. We had some great recommendations from Kenneth and Peter (two of the concierges) and one other whose name we didn't get (sorry). Alan at the front door was always smiling and quick with a good restaurant name and directions for us! We were also only steps from the meeting place of the two tours we took. It's a short walking distance to many attractions and shopping, and right on a bus and train line.",5,2016,10,05
202,"""Here you are Royalty""","Talk about customer service. The Westin is one of the classiest hotels we have ever stayed at. I am not just talking about the building although it was beautiful and the rooms perfect, we were just amazed at the customer service. We really were treated like we were royalty. I had to turn and look behind me to see if they were talking to someone else. I know it is a little pricey but we could, and did, walk everywhere. When we couldn't walk, the front desk would hail us a cab and it was there within minutes.  I know we will be back in the future and the Westin is where I plan to stay. Thank you Westin and I apologize that I didn't get all your names.",5,2016,10,04
202,"Excellent stay, great location","Rooms are clean and luxurious, great breakfast, and situated ideally for a combination of business and pleasure. All all just perfect, but the outstanding friendly service really makes a difference. Will be back when in Dublin again.",5,2016,10,04
202,Perfect location but expensive,"I would like to give the rating 3.5 or 3 with respect to price vs service but because of location I gave 4 star. If you are traveling with family or someone need assistance then it worths staying in this hotel.

With 200+ euro if you don't have breakfast it is not acceptable. You can buy breakfast with $17 but that breakfast doesn't worth it either. Even if you ask for omelet they will charge additional 6 euro.",4,2016,10,03
202,Another Great Stay,"We always stay at the Westin when we are in Dublin. The rooms are very comfortable and quiet and the staff, especially Ann Marie at the front desk and Alan the doorman, were wonderful. The breakfast buffet is good and the Mint Bar on the lower level is great - especially the ""Twelve Roses"" cocktail which quickly became my daughter's favorite (the bar staff was great too!) The location is perfect as well. Looking forward to our next return.",5,2016,10,03
202,Centrally located and luxurious,"It's a Westin. You know what you're getting. It's centrally located to everything, in a rehabbed bank building. The rooms were excellent. The people friendly, and the staff were pleasant. I'd definitely stay there again",5,2016,10,01
202,Great rooms!,"After traveling other places in Europe we were welcomed by comfortable beds and a comfortable room temperature (air conditionerüòÄ). We only stayed one night on the first weekend because they were booked our 2nd and 3rd nights in Dublin. They kindly let us leave our bags for the day. This hotel is in a great location for Temple Bar, Trinity College, Hop on Hop off buses. The staff was super. When we returned to Dublin the following weekend before flying out, we debated about whether to come back into town after dropping the rental car at the airport but my husband insisted we keep our reservation here because he said he knew the room would be comfortable. The room service (we planned to go back to Temple Bar but we were so tired from traveling for 2 weeks) was great and when one small item was forgotten, they brought it promptly and didn't charge for it. ",5,2016,09,30
202,Grandeur and elegance,"The Westin Dublin is situated in an historic building and is able to combine that charm with modern amenities.  The staff is superior and welcoming.  The public areas are beautifully decorated, filled with fresh flowers and a tranquil respite from the bustle of Dublin just beyond the front door.  The mezzanine area is especially lovely with lots of comfy couches, an attractive bar and significant artwork.  Our room offered a charming city view and though the street was especially busy, no noise entered our space.  The bed was, well, heavenly, as advertised.  I wanted to pack it in a suitcase and bring it home with me.  The bathroom was spacious and stocked with nice lotions, shampoo, etc.  Just a few blocks away from popular Grafton Street and not that far from the Temple Bar area, the Westin is perfectly situated for exploring the delights of Dublin.  We sampled the Sunday brunch and were impressed by the beauty of the room and the quality/quantity of the food.  Perhaps the service could be improved as it took about 40 minutes to receive French toast on a not-so-busy morning.  A small inconvenience, to be sure.  We were sorry to leave after only one night but will choose this property for any future visits to Dublin.",5,2016,09,30
202,Best location possible in Dublin with Outstanding staff,"My wife and I ended our stay in Ireland in Dublin at the Westin Dublin and we are so happy we did. This is the perfect location for seeing Dublin. You are right in the center of some of best things and places to see, near buses, restaurants, and shopping. The staff is outstanding from the moment you arrive and are greeted outside to the fabulous people at the front desk area. One person, in particular, was Jeuena with her smile, happy and warm personality welcomes you to the Westin. The hotel was full but she did her best to get us a room that was perfect for our 5-day stay. SPG is noted for the linens they use and this was no exception. The bedding at this Westin was excellent as was the staff that attended the rooms. Breakfast every morning was wonderful with people knowing your name and what you liked to drink. This is the right hotel for a perfect stay in Dublin.",5,2016,09,29
202,Can't really fault it. ,"Stayed for 2 nights. Great location. Couldn't be better. My room was huge (325). 

Breakfast was very nice but the supplementary charge for some items was confusing. Is this necessary in a 5-star hotel?

Reception were immaculately polite and helpful. 

The basement bar was cool to hang out in. Especially as the TVs were showing the UK football. Bar food was good.  

We booked through Fine Hotel & Resorts. This entitled us to ‚Ç¨80 gift per room to spend in-hotel. 

Thoroughly recommended. ",5,2016,09,29
202,Downtown Ireland ,"This is a no brainer. Great hotel, great amenities within walking distance of Crafton street. When in Dublin, there is no other choice ! Great breakfast buffet and a off the beaten track bar that rocks! ",5,2016,09,29
202,"Great location, great staff, some quirky rooms","Took the long way to Dublin, and hit the city at rush hour headed for the Westin hotel. Location-wise, couldn‚Äôt be better ‚Äì across the street from Temple University, a few blocks from shopping, the Abbey Theater, and on every bus route in the city to get further away. Be warned about traffic in downtown Dublin ‚Äì it took 30 minutes to go about a mile from the end of the motorway to the hotel, and the front of the hotel is a construction site as the city rebuilds its streetcar system. The hotel is in a historic building (a bank?) and has worked around the historic bits well. We got a unique room on the fourth floor ‚Äì no big windows, just two little round garret portholes up high on the wall, and a skylight. We had to explore behind curtains a bit to find the portholes. I should note that service at the front desk was excellent, and they prepped us well for the room we found, so once we realized that it was very quiet (hotel's on two very busy streets), we got used to having no view. Parking charges for the car were outrageous, so we requested directions to return it early, and got detailed directions from the bell staff and front desk folks. They marked up my city map and showed me where to get gas and drop off the car, but we were so exhausted, we just had them keep the car and we‚Äôd pay for one night. Had dinner at the bar ‚Äì nice solicitous bartender and a tasty lamb-burger and beef gnocchi. Slept like babies in a bed raised about three feet above the rest of the room. Next morning‚Äôs breakfast buffet was extensive, all self-serve. We did some touristing (the Book of Kells exhibit at Trinity is a don‚Äôt-miss!), and I put the spouse down for a nap. I went to return the car, and found that I‚Äôd lost my map. When I went to the front desk, the associate recognized me and pulled out computer maps the bellman had printed to show me where the nearest service station was and how to get to the rental agency. Nice touch! They also added washcloths to the towels provided in the room (apparently not part of the standard complement), and accommodated my request NOT to have any refrigerator check or turndown service ‚Äì a pet peeve of mine, since I never use hotel-provided munchies, and my spouse was feeling poorly, so the bed was already turned down.  If you haven't experienced Irish showers, be advised this is an outlier - the shower head was on a swivel, not fixed in place like all the other hotels we visited. However the volume of water was so dissipated by the shower head that it fell ""like a gentle rain from heaven"", and thus fell straight down. This is a contrast with all the other plumbing which used water like it was free (there's a big issue currently with the government actually installing water meters), but the fact that you stand either directly under the shower or completely out of it is typical of the three hotels we stayed at in Ireland. Aside from the window quirks and the shower oddity, the place was an A1 venue.  All in all, this was one my better hotel experiences, and I'd happily stay there again.",5,2016,09,28
202,Outstanding,"Location is thr best.  Across the street from Temple Bar area.  Walkable to everything (pubs, attractions, shopping).  Staff is fantastic.  They go out of their way to make you comforatable.  Nice bar, atrium and restaurant.  The best place to stay in Dublin.",5,2016,09,28
202,Perfect location,"The Westin is right in the middle of where everything you'd want to see is. We were able to get around perfectly from this central location. The hotel is very nice, clean, comes with shampoo conditioner body wash etc.. Staff was eager to help with anything from getting a taxi to borrowing tools to fix a broken suitcase. Didn't have breakfast but did had a bite to eat in the Mint bar later in the night and it was very good compared to the food reputation you hear about in Ireland.  ",4,2016,09,28
202,The Best.,"
I ¬†enjoy the service at the Westin brand, and when ¬†I can, I always opt for a stay with them. I ¬†admit I was a little worried recently with the sale of the Starwoods.¬† But this hotel helped me remember it is the people on the ground at the hotels that make the difference.¬† I hope that the merger will mean even more enjoyable stays and excellent service from the Westin team.

So on this visit, we arrive on a typical Irish day. A little rain and a little sun.¬† The front desk team checked us in and while we waited for the room to be ready were I went downstairs to the bar. The room was big, bright and the clean.¬† I ¬†did not take pictures of the bathroom, but it was huge.¬†

My partner and I were there for three days. I encourage all to have breakfast in the dining hall and afternoon tea on the mezzanine.¬† The complex of the building that makes up the hotel hides pleasant surprises and if you have a chance take a walk around.

We will have to wait and see how have the tram running by changes the front entrance, ¬†but that will not keep me away.¬†

202,Great location and service,"Just spent two nights at the Westin.  There is road work right in front of the hotel but no inconvenience of noise nor dust.

Location is great, easy walk to attractions and restaurants.  Everyone is very polite and helpful. Love the quality of their breakfast, real honey dripping from honey comb, great local yogurt, small bottle of soy milk and the absolutely flaky butter croissants.

The downside : Our room is very small, there is not even enough space to put a second bedside table.  Overall doesn't feel as luxurious as other Westin we stayed at.",4,2016,09,25
202,The perfect site stay,"i stayed here with my boyfriend for one night. The service received was excellent- the concierge, checkin, room service- we even received a complimentary super food plate delivered to our room. The mint bar was fab and the cocktails were delicious, I wanted to try them all! They offer a massage service to your room and if you forget your running gear they will sort you out with new balance gear correct to your size! Thoroughly enjoyed our stay",5,2016,09,25
202,Disappointing ,"While as a platinum member I do not expect an upgrade every time, I do at least expect a room with a king size or twin beds when sleeping two. The queen sized bed was too small to be comfortable. The first night, there was also a jackhammer pounding away from the construction site around the hotel way past midnight. The staff were friendly and forthcoming, but not very competent. It took 3 employees to figure out where to seat us for breakfast and then they forgot to bring us our tea. On a positive note, the breakfast quality was impeccable, esp the scrambled eggs and the whole wheat croissants. The location is also very central. ",2,2016,09,23
202,Great place to stay in Dublin,"We just stayed at the Westin last week and were pleased overall with the hotel.  The setting is perfectly located next to the Temple Bar area and within walking distance to all of the main sights. 

Rooms were clean and beds were (as usual) ridiculously comfortable!  Bathrooms were also very clean which is a huge plus.

The restaurant was nice but our waitress was new and literally forgot half of our order.  

The mezzanine bar was a great place for a pint with friendly service and nice surroundings.

The Mint Bar, however, was a huge disappointment.  Don't waste your time eating or drinking there!  The service was atrocious and the food horrible.  Our chicken wings were literally swimming in sauce and our Fish & Chips looked as if they had simply been warmed up from the last shift.  Given the number of amazing pubs in the vicinity, this place was a big NO!",4,2016,09,21
202,Perfect location and service ,Situated near Temple Bar and Trinity College this hotel offers excellent hospitality via its staff's service and rooms. Diverse and tasty breakfast buffet as well. I would revisit next time I am in Dublin proper.,5,2016,09,21
202,Perfect location for touring Dublin,"The Westin is ideally located just a 5 minute walk from Trinity College, perfect for exploring the city on foot.  Apart from that, my room was spacious, very comfortable and quiet with a fabulous bed.  The staff were helpful and friendly.  The manager sent me a personal email after I submitted my online Westin review.  Breakfast was excellent-- perfect scrambled eggs.  I would definitely stay here again.",5,2016,09,19
202,Very disappointing start,"We were given a night in The Westin hotel in Westmoreland street as a present by a dear friend. Feeling very excited, with high expectations we arrived, initially there was confusion over the booking & the receptionist seemed to struggle explaining what the problem was, however she did reassure us that everything was in order & that the room had been prepared & ready for us. We were then allocated our room only to find that it hadn't been cleaned! The previous occupant 's toiletries & rubbish were strewn over the room & the bed linen had NOT been changed. I went to reception & was told that the problem was with 'the booking' & that's why the room wasn't cleaned,Here's hoping that the day will improve, having a drink in The Mint bar & waiting for an apology from management which has NOT been forthcoming .",1,2016,09,18
202,A most peculiar afternoon tea! ,Lovely afternoon spent sampling the delights. You have a choice of traditional or most peculiar afternoon tea. There were four of us so we had two of each. Both equally delicious! Great service in the beautiful surroundings of the atrium lounge. ,5,2016,09,18
202,Afternoon tea,Fabulous afternoon playing catch-up with friends. Fantastic service with beautiful food and no rush from staff so we were able to spend a lovely few hours in the hotel. Definitely on our to stay list at some time :-),5,2016,09,17
202,Great location,"First and only night in Dublin, location was great, easy walk to pubs, food, shops, and attractions.  Hotel was very clean, and a nice helpful staff.  They do serve afternoon tea.  The bars looked fun, but I spent most of my time out and about.",4,2016,09,13
202,Classy and Elegant Westin in Dublin,"My husband and I redeemed our Starwood points for three nights at the Westin Dublin. We found the hotel to be very comfortable, quiet, professionally run. The General Manager recognized our lifetime platinum status but unfortunately, the hotel was booked and he could not offer us the upgraded room we had hoped for. 
The concierge was helpful with restaurant suggestions. We took daily breakfast in lieu of the 500 point platinum amenity which was a good deal.
This was our second visit to the Westin Dublin. It did not disappoint.",5,2016,09,13
202,Loved this hotel!!,"I booked 2 seperate normal rooms on points to accomodate me/wife and 2 older boys. They upgraded us to balcony room and balcony writers room and loved them both. 
My kids room was next door with 2 beds, balcony and quite roomy.
Our room was simple, clean, cozy and relaxing with a huge balcony as well. The beds were so comfortable as well. We stayed in Rome, Paris, and Munich and this was the best bed!
They acknowledged my platinum status, upgraded and gave me 2 breakfasts daily. I had to pay $17 for each kid but that was a discount from $23 I believe. The breakfast was pretty good. 
Concierge was great at getting us guinness tickets and we had also bought some soccer tickets and explained the easiest way to get to stadium. Very helpful and nice everyone was.
The hotel is in prime location, walkable to endless restaurants, pubs and shopping. Met some great people in this wonderful city. 
The gym was good, the mint bar was nice also. I did not dislike one thing about this hotel. 
They even sent me up a cake for my bday and some welcome snacks which was so nice. 
I highly recommend staying here, going to guinness and a pub down the street called layfiette (best bartender in dublin). Dont mind the construction going on! I will be back someday!!! 
I am platinum with Marriott, SPG and IHG and so glad I chose the westin over the Rennisance or Intercontinental!!",5,2016,09,12
202,Beautiful hotel,"Stayed here for one night on a shopping trip, great location in middle of town. Rooms were spacious for city centre and very modern, had a few drinks in the bar before heading out for the night. Beautiful cocktails and good atmosphere in bar. Breakfast the next day was quick and good selection. Would certainly stay here again",5,2016,09,12
202,Perfect location,"Styes here for 2 nights at the end of August over the UK bank holiday weekend.

The concierge were immediately welcoming and friendly.

The room was located on the 4th floor with a rather lovely view over part of the city.
The room size wasn't huge but ideal for the weekend. The bathroom was exceptional.

The hotel location can not be faulted and is in easy walking distance of everything in the centre of Dublin.

Taxis will pull up outside of the hotel which is convenient if its hammering it down with rain and you need to get to the Guinness factory!
",5,2016,09,11
202,A Few Nights in Ireland's Capital,"This is one of SPG's finest properties. Pleasantly surprised with how detailed the decor was, how friendly the service was, and how centrally located the property was. Very comfortable bed and generous size bathroom. The workout facility had everything I needed. Checking in was a breeze. The hotel occupies a former bank building, which was particularly charming. I would undoubtedly recommend this property to anyone visiting Dublin.",5,2016,09,11
202,"Lovely hotel across from Trinity College. Perfect location for museums, restaurants and shopping.",The staff could not have been more helpful from the doorman who helped us with directions and taxis to the concierge who recommended restaurants and made reservations for us to the desk staff who were always friendly and went out of their way to make us comfortable,4,2016,09,10
202,Enjoyable Stay,"We stayed for 4 nights. The hotel staff were wonderful, as was our room. Our room was very quiet except for one night when outside work was being done for the new transit line. Hotel staff spoke with transit and it didn't happen again. The Westin has an ideal location for Trinity  College, Temple Bar area, meet up locations for day tours and a wonderful variety of restaurants and pubs nearby.",5,2016,09,09
202,"Very comfortable, friendly staff","In a great location surrounded by lots of shops and near to the river. Fantastic views across Dublin from the 3-5th floors. Haven't tried the food but did overhead someone being very complimentary about it. Very good bed, bathroom and (!) water pressure. Staff - from concierge to reception desk are welcoming, friendly and helpful throughout and the SPG card recognition was clear. Really enjoyed this stay.",4,2016,09,09
202,Great location and quiet rooms,"The hotel is one block from Trinity college and one block from the temple bar area. Close to lots of restaurants and sites. There is construction going on right outside but we didn't hear any of it despite our room being right above it. Nice bar in Lower level and tea service in courtyard but we didn't have time to try the latter. I think there is parking but we elected to pick up a car as we were leaving Dublin, which was about a 10 min taxi ride. 
",4,2016,09,09
202,Fabulous hotel!!,Beds were very comfortable and the room was quiet.  We had a room overlooking the mezzanine.  The breakfast buffet was terrific.  All the employees were very helpful.  We had tea one afternoon on the mezzanine and it was delightful.  The location was great for sightseeing as you could walk to most popular sights.  It is very close to Trinity College.,5,2016,09,08
202,Fantastic location & hotel,Stayed here for 4 nights in a wonderful room. It was very clean and well maintained as you would expect from a Westin. The staff was extremely helpful and nice and the breakfast buffet was wonderful.  Most importantly the location was prime - close walking distance to everything you want to see and easy to hop on tour busses and take the bus to the airport etc.,5,2016,09,07
202,Beautiful Hotel with Amazing Service,"We were upgraded to a full bi-level suite.  The room was beautifully furnished and well laid out. One of our bags did not make it with the flight, and upon check-in, the staff offered to track our bag.  When the bag was found the next day, the staff had placed the bag in our room before we got home.  We were visiting during the olympics and there were some events we wanted to stream through the TV.  Two hotel staff quickly came up to the room to help us get everything in working order.  The bed was very comfortable.  The air conditioning worked well.  The location was excellent and the staff were very happy to give recommendations and directions.  We also ate downstairs at the Mint Bar and the food was excellent! ",5,2016,09,05
202,One of Westin's nicest properties,I've stayed at Westin properties all over the world and this is one of my favorites.  It ranks up there with the palace in Madrid.  We traveled to Dublin for the College Football kickoff between Georgia Tech and Boston College.  This property is conveniently located across the street from Temple Bar which has great places to eat and lots of pubs and nightlife.  The rooms are very well done and I was pleasantly surprised with how big the bathroom was.  ,5,2016,09,04
202,Afternoon Tea,"Fabulous hotel. We had the Most Peculiar Afternoon Tea which is with Mojito instead of tea. Lovely selection of food and the staff were great and very attentive. Booking is a must, would highly recommend ",5,2016,09,04
202,Old and new well mixed,"Located very close to several areas of shopping and cultural importance, this Westin property is a good place to stay. The rooms house comfy beds and make very good use of space. The basement bar is a good one, and the atrium cafe is also a good place to eat. ",5,2016,09,02
202,Downtown Dublin ,"Five star hotel with excellent amenities and staff. Our room even had one 110v outlet. The room was very quiet and bathroom very nice. No king size beds available. The queen bed was just right and nighttime television viewing was quite different than American TV.

Dublin city centre is adding rail transport and construction has been underway for a year with another year until completion. As a result sidewalks are narrower than normal or gone completely. ",5,2016,09,01
202,Very Classy Downtown Dublin Hotel!,"My husband, son and fiance and granddaughter had a very nice stay at this very nice downtown Dublin hotel.  It's location could not have been better for our sightseeing and our restaurant/nightlife in the Temple Bar area.",5,2016,09,01
202,"Best location, impeccable property!","I recently spent 3 nights at the Westin Dublin on vacation.  What a lovely property!  The staff was wonderful.  They provided a delicious, customized amenity for our special occasion and they were always great with providing directions and recommendations.  The hotel is so clean and well-appointed.  We stayed on I believe the 6th floor and had a huge, private terrace that was to-die-for.  If you want to enjoy beautiful views, request the highest floor rooms with the terrace.  The hotel is also very quiet and breakfast was good as well.  They have many more healthy options than we have seen in Europe so that was a huge plus.  Finally, the location could not be beat. Just a hop away from Grafton Street and so many amazing restaurants.",5,2016,08,31
202,A Most Peculiar Afternoon Tea,"I had the most peculiar afternoon tea there recently & I all in all it was a wonderful experience. 
The service was impeccable, very efficient & all of the young girls waiting on us were very friendly.
The savoury selection was varied, The cheek was particularly delicious. Not a lover of banana bread I really didn't think I was going to enjoy this part of it but I savoured every mouthful. So happy to have gotten the exact  recipe for it online. Fingers crossed that it tastes as good. 
The sweet were a gastronomic delight. The popping candy had grown women resorting to childish wonder. 
My only criticism is that a cocktail is served with this option, I told the waitress that I was the designated driver but no other non-alternative was suggested. I was also charged the exact same as if I had had an entire tea pot of cocktail. 
This needs to change. I have afternoon tea in London & other locations and have always had another alcohol free version offered where applicable.",4,2016,08,31
202,Great Dublin Location!,"We spent two nights here during our recent holiday.  It is right across from the Temple Bar area, and a couple of blocks from both Trinity College in one direction, or the north side of the city and the General Post Office in another.  We found the location terrific as tourists!  The staff was lovely, welcoming and accommodating.  The hotel is a converted bank, so there is lots of marble and lots to look at.  As you would expect, the Westin beds were lovely after a days walking and touring, and the baths were extra special.  Outside, it's a bit difficult right now with the construction for the new Tram, but don't fault the hotel--it will only make the location more accessible.",5,2016,08,30
202,"Perfect hotel, better location","While in Dublin one of the best hotels is this one. Very proper staff and a great breakfast.The location is perfect, right next to the book of kells, the Dublin castle,a mass amount of restaurants and bars.the viking museum and tall crosses are a short 10 minute walk.",4,2016,08,30
202,A peculiar afternoon tea ,We thoroughly enjoyed our tea here. It is a little pricey but well worth it. If you get the chance stick your neck out and go with the alternative to tradition.  It was well thought through and totally amazing. Where else would you get a mojito in a tea pot and popping candy in a marshmallow??? Would definitely do this again.  Also the setting is fantastic and the service second to none. Really well done.,5,2016,08,24
202,Would definitely recommend it!!,"We loved this hotel! It was right in the middle of Dublin. The room was huge and the bed was very comfortable. The staff were very friendly and helpful. 

We rented a car with the help of the concierge. We used Hertz and they picked us up at the hotel. It was much easier than getting it from the airport since we had just entered the country and were not familiar with the city.

We had the breakfast buffet and it was quite good. I am gluten free and they were happy to accommodate me. We also went to the lounge. It was nice. There was a young lady mixing music on the 2nd night we visited.

We spent 2 nights here then traveled around the country for 5 days and returned back to Dublin. It was not the cheapest but We felt like it was worth it. It had an upscale decor with a doorman greeting you. ",5,2016,08,24
202,Perfect location and great service.,"Located in the very heart of the city, just a couple of blocks away from Trinity College (The Book of Kells) makes this hotel a perfect choice as your hopping off point of your stay in Dublin. At this time, many are complaining about the construction projects in the streets, but it's a minor inconvenience, that just adds to traffic. We didn't have any noise problems in our room, which faced the street. The concierge (twins) were extremely helpful with their recommendations for local restaurants,and trust me, the food is far better than many will tell you. Irish beef is excellent. And so is their fresh salmon and Hake. The Hotel allows you to pre-arrange reservations for breakfast, and if you indeed want breakfast, take advantage of the early booking discount. If it's raining, the concierge will offer you an umbrella. Afternoon tea in the upstairs atrium is an enjoyable rest after a day of touring. We shared the Peculiar and traditional offering, substituting the tea for a Mojito filled teapot. Finger snacks were enjoyable, but it's the overall scene that is very nice. As an SPG member, the front desk made sure to match by requests for a featherless room without even asking.And, the mattress is very comfortable. Some will say the hotel is ""dated"", and it is, but there's an old world charm about it. But importantly,location is perfect. One day we wanted to get a private tour of the Wicklow Mountain area and we asked the concierge to recommend a driver. Alan Ingoldsby drove us to Glendolough and Powerscourt for a marvelous tour. Showed us celebrity homes and just had a terrific time. Once again, the concierge twins provided the contact.",4,2016,08,24
202,Front Desk staff were exceptional.  Rooms very comfortable.,"My review is meant to be helpful to the Westin as we routinely stay with this chain.
The front desk staff was beyond exceptional.  They provided everything and more than we requested.  We stayed our first 3 days in Ireland with the Westin Dublin and again one more night prior to our departure at the end of our tour of Ireland.
The breakfast buffet was remarkable, all the food and beverage items were delicious with the attention to detail a mark above.  Right down to the natural bee hive honey!
The service in the breakfast restaurant was a cut above and most relaxing.
When we stayed the first three days we found the door man, concierge and all staff to be knowledgable and extremely friendly.  Thank you.
Our final night was a different experience with the concierge providing a recommendation for a good 'burger' at a steak house 'just down the road' in the temple bar area.  We were excited to have what he described as the best burger in Dublin at a place called FX Buckley.  He said we would not need a reservation on a Monday night and that it was just down toward the actual 'Temple Bar'.  We were hungry and tired so that sounded easy and good to us.  We walked for over a half hour looking up and down for the 'just down the road' restaurant that turned out to be down and over and up another street.  Had we been given proper directions or a map, we would have found it within 5 minutes but that was not the case!  Perhaps ask the concierge to always provide a map!  Also, when we did arrive the maitre d' laughed when we said we were sent from the Westin without a reservation.  They were fully booked, especially when we mentioned that we were hoping to have a burger!!  This is obviously a popular top steak spot!  The maitre d' seemed put off that we wandered in without a res!!
When we got back to the Westin exhausted we decided to eat at the only open restaurant in the hotel, the Mint.  A bar atmosphere restaurant.  The service in the Mint was lacking this particular night by comparison to the remainder of the hotel.  We did manage to order a burger here which was just fine.  No complaints about the food.
Our wake up was very good and at 4:30 AM we were very appreciative of the front desk staff and door man once again.  The front desk staff arranged a coffee and tea for us to take along to the airport and the door man retrieve our car and had it waiting for us.
Once again exceptional service as we departed.
The rooms were well appointed and as usual heavenly beds.  Thank you Westin, hopefully my remarks are helpful.",5,2016,08,24
202,Afternoon of peculiar delights,"Had the delicious afternoon tea here with a friend. We had both the traditional & the peculiar teas, while it is slightly more expensive than other hotels for afternoon tea it is well worth it. The waiting staff are really friendly but not intrusive, gorgeous surroundings and you can sit for as long as you like. Great for a special treat!!",4,2016,08,23
202,I love you hotel mattress,"My husband and I could have foregone a few hours of waking around Dublin just to spend more time with that mattress and pillows. It was amazing.  The rest of the hotel was nice too, but oh I slept so well!

Be advised, everything in Dublin is under construction while they build out their trolley system, that makes The Westin a difficult walking spot during the high touring times of the day.",5,2016,08,23
202,Great Location and Great Hotel,"I stayed at the Westin Dublin for 4 nights following a tour of Ireland. The location was excellent, right next to Trinity College and only a few minutes walk to both Grafton Street and O'Connell Street. From the Front Desk, to the Concierge and Doormen, the service was outstanding. My room was super clean and the bed was so comfortable. A special ""Thank You"" to Silvia at the Front Desk who constantly went out of her way to help make my stay perfect. I hope to return to Ireland someday and will definitely stay at the Westin Dublin.",5,2016,08,21
202,Well located. Nice staff. ,"Perfect location, could not be better. Walk everywhere, across from Trinity College. Concierge was friendly and very helpful. Doormen nice and welcoming, same with front desk. Not a top tier Westin property but pleasant experience. We had a nice balcony. Great Starbucks nearby. ",4,2016,08,20
202,Staff treat you like king but not in a snobby way....in a kind and awesome way,"I stayed in this hotel +10 times for both business and leisure and love it!!

Pros:
===============
Location - perfect!! walking distance from great food, shopping and sights
Rooms - great and comfortable
Food - very good both in the breakfast lounge and in the bar
Gym - GREAT - got what you need and only missing a yoga mat (even got shower in it)
Internet - last time I stayed there it was free with no room and last name login - awesome
SPG - free breakfast and rich breakfast for platinum members

!!!! and above all the Staff is amazing!! so helpful, so polite, and will get you anything you need, even if it is a berries bowl for breakfast for your toddler, or extending your trip when they are sold out online!!

Cons:
===============
Only one, rooms are on the smaller side but aside from that perfect hotel!!",5,2016,08,20
202,"Excellent location, attentive staff","We stayed for two nights at the Westin while on vacation in Dublin.  The location was excellent, although the widespread construction around the area made driving in and out a challenge!  The building is old and historic, within walking distance of many attractions, and there is a taxi stand right around the corner for longer trips.  There are many restaurants and pubs in the area.  Staff were helpful generally and tried to make our visit as pleasant as possible.  The only negative was that the beds were a little bit too hard (not the usual Heavenly Bed experience, and the room was slightly too warm for optimal sleeping.  I would book this again if in the area.",4,2016,08,20
202,Puke on floor...no joke.,"It takes a lot to get me to write a negative review. I have stayed at Westin Hotels all over the US. I have found them to be great for business travel as an SPG member I liked the brand. Until my experience in Dublin. Nearly all of Dublin was booked as coincidentally Springsteen was in town. We got a room and the price was over $680 euros for one night ! I complained about the price and was told by registration ""don't blame me blame Springsteen all hotels rates are increased due to demand."" So gouging the customer is ok? We got to our room and there was a foul smell. Then my son stepped in wet puke on the floor by the bed. We nearly all puked. We complained and they moved us. The next day I left my car in the valet park as they said we could and while we went to a communion & then I received a call from the manager saying I needed to come back & move the car and he argued with me. I told the manager of this abuse who finally reduced the outrageous rate. For such a horrid experience it should have been free. When I returned to the states I complained to Westin in the US and they told me they apologize and would get back to me with a solution. Three months later...I am still waiting for Westin to make it right. I felt bad for the manager each time he tried to ""make it right"" another staff member would make it worse. Listen up Westin, give the hotel manager the power to refund ALL OF YOUR GUESTS MONEY as they made me wait for three days to tell me what my discount would be. As much as we loved Dublin the Westin was the worst hotel experience I have had in over 40 years of travel.",1,2016,08,19
202,Westin high standard...but waitstaff a bit lacking.,"We stayed here on our first day in Dublin and it was as you would expect for a Westin. Great beds, that's why we're loyal to the SPG brands, and bellstaff was excellent. As was housekeeping when we needed to ask for extra towels and toiletries since there were 3 of us in one room...that handily made space for a rollaway. But the morning restaurant staff were a bit lacking. It was a buffet, but other than the initial asking of what I wanted to drink, we never had anyone come back to the table to take away plates or ask if I needed more tea. That was disappointing, but the breakfast fare was exceptionally good.",4,2016,08,19
202,Five Stars All Around!,"My wife and I recently spent six nights at the Westin Dublin. We found the hotel to be exceptional. The location was perfect, but it was the staff that truly made our stay so enjoyable. From the front desk staff, to the concierge and the doormen - everyone was helpful and willing to assist. This is a property that does the Westin brand proud. Thank you Dublin Westin!",5,2016,08,17
202,"Very good, as to be expected","As expected from the Westin a very good stay. Location is great, directly in the centre, and the room was very quiet, clean, up to date.
We did not check out the breakfast as we decided to do it pubstyle somewhere else, but Westin Dublin is highly recommendable !
",5,2016,08,16
202,Nice hotel in Dublin. Service has room for improvement.,"Nice hotel in Dublin. 

I got a room with a window that opens up to the roof of the adjacent building which reminded me of the book 'A Little Princess.' This view was interesting. I liked the book when I was a kid. The roof was pretty enough but I would have appreciated if I had been given an advance notice at check in. I most likely would have still taken the room. Other than that, everything was great in terms of hardware and location. I love Westin Heavenly beds.

I would post a photo but my phone was stolen in Dublin by a bike rider on my way back to the hotel (Edit: Found a photo taken before the accident.) Do not carry your phone out in the open in Dublin! 
This hotel is only a few minutes away from the police station - once you get to know the direction - and the staff at the reception was nice enough to lend me a pen that I can write down the imei number of the phone - you need this information when you are reporting a stolen phone in Dublin as the signage at the police station says. 
However, the staffs at the concierge desk could have been more helpful when I asked for the direction to the police station. It was very hard to find the police station just with the 'right outside on the Pearse street' especially without a phone nor a map and with all the constructions right outside of the hotel late in the evening (dark).",3,2016,08,15
202,"Super location, great hotel","Getting to this location took a while with all the construction in Dublin, but once we valeted the car, we didn't need it until we left for the airport.  The hotel is in a terrific central location with easy access to restaurants, shopping, and Trinity College.  The room was clean and comfortable, as expected.  Staff were friendly and helpful.",5,2016,08,15
202,"Prime location, wonderful stay","My wife and I stayed at the Westin for one night, and had a magnificent experience. The staff - from the doorman to the receptionist - treated us warmly and offered up excellent hospitality. The building and our room were clean, crisp, and inviting. Our view overlooking the atrium/courtyard was quite nice. The location is right across from Trinity College and the Temple Bar district. Would highly recommend!",5,2016,08,15
202,A romantic getaway,"Just spent the weekend at the Westin. Brilliant location to explore vibrant and cultural Dublin. Our room was a little disappointing for a 5 star hotel, toilet door did not close properly and took two tries to flush toilet! Also the rooms have very poor lighting. (Not sure if Reserving it on booking.com meant the standard was lower!)On another occasion I was assured that there was a correct adaptor in my room for my needs (all important hair straightener needed for night out!!) The receptionist was incorrect and when I asked for one it never showed up as the concierge were too busy. These are the little things that make a stay, especially on a weekend break. Lunch in the bar was delicious and the doorman is a delight. Overall a good stay and I would recommend. ",4,2016,08,14
202,"Location, location, location","The Westin Dublin was great, so well situated you could walk across the street to see Trinity College and The Book of Kells (get tickets on line) or in the other direction to Temple Bar area. There is music all around. The staff was very helpful!",5,2016,08,14
202,"Great Location and Experience, Lives up to the Finest Standards","The Westin heavenly bed is luxurious and always makes choosing a Westin over any other good hotel an easy choice.  But more than that, this Westin works very hard to make you feel at home and comfortable (not all of them are able to succeed in this regard).  The breakfasts are excellent (unlike other Irish breakfasts......), and the service also quite good.  If I come back to Dublin, I will definitely stay here again.   Also, as a tourist (which I was), its location cannot be beat.  It is next to Trinity College and adjacent to Temple Bar.",5,2016,08,13
202,Super Luxurious with too many additional charges,"The rooms at the Westin were wonderful! The comfort of the beds and the view from our room made it an excellent choice for a room in Dublin. What bothered me was for such an expensive hotel you would expect some options to go along with the room, like fresh coffee in the morning or continental breakfast at no charge. In addition, the charge for parking our car was excessive for 2 nights.",4,2016,08,12
202,"Elegant and comfortable, few complaints","This is a beautiful hotel with very comfortable beds and lovely furnishings.  Good night's sleep in a perfect bed, and as another reviewer mentioned, really nice after a couple of lower tier hotels.  We were in 401 which overlooks roof tops and interesting buildings; happy with the view.  Lots of amenities, and extra towels and a safety mat for the shower were brought when requested.  Internet worked well and we had enough outlets to charge up our devices.  Staff attitude varies from cordial or business-y to warm and friendly.  The doormen were the nicest staff we encountered and were very helpful with bags, directions and taxis.  Our minimal complaints:  no pool, room was small for the price (we had a lot of luggage for a long trip, which reception knew), and basically no place to sit and write or work on the computer.  A counter over the cupboards and under the TV was the only large surface, which one could not sit in front of.  My husband was asked to leave the lounge area if he was not going to order, which we found surprising and a little rude.  The room was not full. If they did not want him to sit in an area prepared for tea service, if that was the issue, they could have asked him to sit in another chair, rather than asking him to leave the lounge.  Regarding our room configuration, it was hard to get my disability scooter in and out of the room because of tight quarters.  That surprised us because the check-in clerk saw I had a scooter.  But they did honor my request to be near an elevator which I very much appreciated.  Overall, we'd be happy to stay here again although the lack of a pool would be a consideration since that's my primary therapy and exercise.  Those small issues keep me from giving the place five stars; if they were not a problem for you, you'd probably find this place perfect.",4,2016,08,12
202,"Gorgeous rooms, hit or miss service ","I stay here semi regularly for work and am lucky to be in such a beautiful building. 

Being SPG platinum - unlike other properties - I'm always surprised at how hit or miss the service here is. It's either amazing (get recognized, upgraded, etc.) or I have to remind them upon check-in what my status allows for (and sometimes have to be assertive to get it, which is really frustrating!). 

There's a lot of construction going on, so you want to make sure your room faces Trinity. Location is pretty convenient to walk most places and not far from the LUAS. 

",3,2016,08,12
202,Refreshing after several lower tier hotels,"Maybe it's because we had just come from a very basic Bed & Breakfast, but the Westin was a refreshing, felt like being home in the US, hotel.  The bathroom was wonderful!  We enjoyed the bathrobes & slippers provided in the room.  The a/c was nice and quiet.  The breakfast was great!  Our room was tucked far away from the elevator near the fitness center, so we did hear some noise, but it wasn't excessive.  There is construction going on all around the hotel (stayed 8/8-8/10/2016) but we didn't notice it at all once we were inside the hotel.  Location was great if you want to explore Dublin, it was in the middle of it all!!  I would stay here again.",5,2016,08,11
202,Made me feel at home ,"Clean lodgings and friendly staff.  Breakfast was included and the food was wildly  awesome   If I stayed longer I would have to make better food choices as the food is way to good. Location is central to everything Dublin has to offer.   Close to Trinity College, Temple Bar, Whiskey Museum, tours and so much more.  ",5,2016,08,11
202,"Great location, great hotel.","Typical big city Westin - wonderfully appointed, great location (minutes from Trinity College, Temple Bar, Grafton Street, museums). Staff was super friendly and helpful. Our room was on the 4th floor and was large and beautiful. Breakfast buffet was outstanding. There was some annoying construction on the street in front of the hotel, but this certainly wasn't the hotel's fault... Really enjoyed our stay at the Westin Dublin. Mint Bar downstairs was lovely for a happy hour cocktail.",5,2016,08,10
202,Fantastic,"We had a fantastic stay at this hotel, it's so well positioned and we found the staff extremely friendly & helpful.  Our room was extremely comfortable and well appointed. We had a delicious dinner in the inviting Mint Bar and also enjoyed the traditional Irish bars just across the road in Fleet Street.",5,2016,08,10
202,Mint bar is amazing!,"Went to The Westin on a couple occasions to visit The Mint Bar downstairs & it was amazing! If you're looking for a place to hang out with your friends & have some great cocktails and snacks, this is the place for you! 

Thank you for the great service, food and drinks! Will be back!",5,2016,08,09
202,"Great Stay, Great Location","Great Location in downtown Dublin. Walking distance to all hot spots. Extremely friendly customer service, clean rooms, excellent breakfast. In hotel Bar and Grill a trendy, yet sophisticated spot for a cocktail any time of the day.",5,2016,08,07
202,Lunch and prosecco in the mint bar,"Met up with for lunch and prosecco here, 2 couples and 2 babies.
The mint bar downstairs is gorgeous, very stylish and family friendly. 
We found the menu very varied and we all got delicious food, prawn caesar was yummy! 
Bar staff were very friendly, service was slightly on the slow side but we were in no hurry so it didn't bother us. 
Prosecco served with lovely strawberries on the side, nice touch. 
Would definitely go back for night time drinks minus kids! Hotel is lovely and right in central Dublin.",5,2016,08,07
202,This place is amazing,There is no better place to stay while n Dublin. We stayed there for three nights and everyone was so nice and friendly. Couldn't have picked a better place to stay on our 3 week trip to Ireland. Staff outstanding.,5,2016,08,06
202,Great food and great service,"I have just returned to London after spending a few days in Dublin visiting friends. We went to the Westin mint bar for lunch. We were greeted on entering the bar and from then on the service was second to none. The young man who served us was attentive, friendly and professional. There were six of us eating and we all agreed that the food was excellent. I am looking forward to a return visit when next in Dublin.",5,2016,08,05
202,When you're tired you take first available,"Flew over from the US, not usually tired but this time on a shorter leg we were both beat. When asked first available room, we both agreed. 
Don't let me think I do not like this hotel, I Love it. From the Bell Captain grabbing our bags from our taxi, so gracious. Not looking for a tip. 
We get back to the hotel after being up 24 hrs, to find our bags in a large room on SPG floor, but no view. 
Concierge very helpful, and front desk very helpful as I left some tickets at home, but can retrieve them from email.
Great location near Trinity college, Temple bar area. ",5,2016,08,04
202,Great hotel in a great location,"The Westin is fantastic. Our room overlooked the back of Trinity Church which made our tour there so easy to get to. We were across the street from the Temple Bar area as well so good and nightlife was just steps away. The staff is top notch. Everyone was so nice and helpful. I arrived but my luggage didn't show up until the next day. They made a copy of my paperwork from the airport so they could follow up the next day when the bag was due to come in. I was able to go out and tour and my suitcase was in my room when I returned later that afternoon. We only spent 2 nights before we started touring the rest of the country. After leaving the Westin and staying in some other places around Ireland, I'm so glad we are spending our last 2 nights there before we head home.  The only annoyance is the construction on the road for the light rail but that is not the fault of the Westin and can't be avoided. I can't wait to go back!",5,2016,08,04
202,Lots of fun,"Westin is lots of fun, helpful staff, very sincere.  Had trouble getting our boarding passes on the computer and a receptionist took over on her computer and we were in business.
Mint bar tenders very accommodating and the wait staff over the top.  They made an effort.  Wake up call a little late however.  
Great location at the top of temple bar but far enough away to have a quiet room.  Concierge was knowledgable and sent us to good places and had good suggestions",5,2016,08,03
202,Westin Dublin Superior Service,"Concierge, Mint Bar, and Front Desk folks all provided amazingly attentive and personal service for all 5 days/nights we were there.  The room condition and property were all beautiful and well-kept.  This is right in the heart of Downtown Dublin - close to so many locations (Trinity College, Whiskey Museum, Temple Bar area) - so great.  Highly recommend it.",5,2016,08,02
202,Great hotel in great location.,"Friendly and helpful staff right from the start. Great accommodations, even if our bathroom was a little tight. Excellent breakfast buffet with a wide assortment of food and drink. Location is very close to Trinity and a quick walk to Temple Bar. Would go back!",5,2016,08,02
202,Can't beat the location!,"If you‚Äôve experienced Westin hotels, this will be no surprise -- excellent service, super comfortable beds,  little extras.  The location could not be better;  cross one street and you‚Äôre at Trinity College and the Book of Kells, cross one street on the other side and you‚Äôre in the Temple Bar area with gobs of pubs and restaurants.  The Hop On Hop Off bus is a block away and tickets can be purchased at the Tourist Info Center right there.  
In spite of the crowds, rushing traffic, and construction (rail line) right in front of the hotel, it was fairly quiet in our room.
Do not, however, ask the concierge or front desk for restaurant recommendations  I suspect there is a business partnership of some sort between certain restaurants and the hotel.  The Boxty House WAS a good recommendation, La Caverna in Temple Bar was not. Breakfast in the hotel is a bit pricey, so you may want to walk to restaurant nearby. (Lincoln House)

As with every hotel and B&B during our three week stay, there is no electrical outlet in the bathroom other than the two-prong outlet meant solely for shavers.  If you need a mirror and a nearby outlet in order to style your hair, I‚Äôd suggest packing an extension cord along with a 3-prong adapter.
The hotel has an agreement with one of the taxi companies;  they guarantee that the fee between the hotel and the airport will be no more than 24 Euro.",5,2016,08,02
202,Dublin Delight!,"We thoroughly enjoyed a weeklong stay at this classic hotel ideally located in the heart of Dublin. Friendly and efficient service, comfortable and tastefully furnished room, spacious modern bath. Close to everything. Highly recommended. ",5,2016,08,01
202,5 star service,"Even with our early arrival, our room was ready.  We opted for the NO HOUSEKEEPING offer and were well rewarded.  The airline lost our luggage and the Westin took hold of our situation to help in every way possible from calls, inquiries and shopping recommendations to replenish lost belongings .  Flavored waters welcomed us in the reception area . The fitness room was well stocked with outstanding equipment.  Shopping and historical sites were just strolls away .  Excellent dining and coffee shops just around the corner.  A/C a welcomed surprise .",5,2016,08,01
202,Amazing hotel in an amazing location!!!,"Our first trip to Ireland and we were not disappointed.  Beautiful hotel and you couldn't beat the location, we were in walking distance to many locations including a hop on hop off stop and a water side cafe with the best lattes!!!  Highly recommend to anyone staying in Dublin!",5,2016,07,31
202,Excellent service and food offering,"You expect a high standard from a 5* hotel, but I have been coming here for about 15 years and the food & drinks are consistently good in the Atrium Lounge and the service is really exceptional.  Polished, professional & friendly.  ",5,2016,07,31
202,"Great location, met all our needs","Although it is a bit pricey, the location, service and amenities cannot be beat!  Our room was ready when we arrived at 11 am and we were upgraded to a nicer room.  The restaurants and bars are all nice, with a good choice for breakfast or a late night drink or snack. 
Fantastic location near Grafton Street, Temple Bar area and Trinity College, as well as the Hop On, Hop Off bus.  Only a short walk across the Liffey to O'Connell Street.",5,2016,07,31
202,BETTER THAN ALL THE REST,"We went to Dublin recently for a short break....to shop, wine, dine and to see ONCE and BILLY ELLIOTT. We were off to a wonderful start when we arrived at The Westin in the heart of Dublin. What a place! Such luxury and such fine food! We've travelled extensively throughout the world and have NEVER experienced such amazing mattresses and pillows! The rooms were lovely and beautifully maintained. The bathroom was a marble delight very well equipped and with ample good quality toiletries and towels, robes and slippers. Breakfast was delicious with an extensive menu to suit all palates. Can hardly wait to return but in meantime will recommend Westin to others travelling to Dublin.",5,2016,07,30
202,Lovely Luxury Hotel in the heart of Dublin,"Lovely hotel with very attentive staff.
Some of the rooms are situated around a central atrium which functions as a bar and also serves afternoon tea which is exquisite.
Bedrooms beautifully appointed, although the coffee/beige colour scheme does mean that they are quite dark.
Plentiful and varied choice at breakfast.
This hotel is aimed at the American market with everything bold and up front - no complaints at all.  It is expensive, but sometimes it's worth paying that bit extra.",5,2016,07,29
202,Superb hotel!,"Loved our stay in the Westin. The hotel is in a fabulous location. Staff are great and rooms very comfortable. We were delighted to find a fantastic band playing in the downstairs bar when we went for a nightcap. Ambience was lovely and relaxed, felt very spoilt. We would always stay here for any return visits to Dublin given an option, great hotel.",5,2016,07,28
202,Ideal Location,"We stayed at this hotel for 2 extra days after our tour through Ireland had ended. The hotel is located in the center of the main activities and sights. It is practically across the street fro Trinity College (where the Book of Kells is displayed, a must see) and within walking distance from all the must tourist attractions in Dublin. Additionally, the hotel lobby, rooms & dinning eras are very beautiful, and the hotel personnel is very helpful & friendly. Excellent service. Definitely I highly recommend this hotel to people planning to visit Dublin.",5,2016,07,28
202,Good hotel but awkward rooms,"I stayed in this hotel 3-4 times over four months, The hotel staff were amazing at check in, the concierge was great with tips and directions and the food was generally good. My only compliant is that every room had me split over two floors (one two / three steps below the other), so while the room size was fine it was just an awkward room layout. I do think the Westbury has better rooms but the service at the Westin will win me every time.",4,2016,07,28
202,Great hotel but choose your room carefully,"We spent four nights at the Westin. Service (reception, concierge, doorman, maids waitresses) was excellent. When choosing the room overlooking the atrium we expected to be a little  dark but not that dark. The lights had to be on all day and there was not enough lamps. Our room was in L shape and there were lamps near the bed and by the
desk but nothing in the middle. Very depressing. The layout  (118) was not practical
for two persons: only one chair.
That said we were very pleased with everything else: Large and nice bathroom,
very good buffet breakfast, delicious high tea and good dinner at the Mint Bar.
If in Dublin we would go back to the Westin but in a higher category room.",4,2016,07,27
202,Great Location,"We enjoyed our two-night stay in the heart of Dublin at the Westin.  The first thing we noticed was how pleasant and helpful all the the help were, from the doorman to the desk clerk to the concierge. The rooms were nicely appointed and clean. The bathroom had obviously just been redone. The street outside was completely torn up with some sort of rail construction; however, the staff did everything possible to accommodate us. The pub in the basement provided a lovely, meal upon our arrival as the dining room was not open because of the construction right outside. The location made our stay even a greater pleasure. We were in walking distance of the pedestrian streets and the famous Trinity college with its collection of ancient manuscripts and the ""long room"" filled with all works, old and new published in Ireland.  Just a block away there was a stop for the hop-on hop-off bus which took full advantage of. One should consider the Westin Dublin when traveling there.",4,2016,07,27
202,Break in Dublin,"Stayed at the Westin for 4 nights and enjoyed the hotel, in a fantastic position close to Temple Bar, Trinity College the shopping and historical areas of Dublin. The hotel is well maintained has excellent and professional staff. The rooms are well maintained and extremely well soundproofed. ",5,2016,07,27
202,Great location and service,We just spent 5 days at this location and it was a pleasure. Location is very close to the best shopping and across the street from the Temple Bar area. Everyone on staff was very friendly and went out of their way to help you out. Concierge service was excellent in assisting us. Rooms are nice and roomy. ,5,2016,07,26
202,"Great location, wonderfull accomodations, and GREAT staff!","We stayed at the Westin Dublin on two separate nights during our visit to Ireland.  Even though I booked trip on points, the staff catered to all our needs.  Wish I recalled the names of the 2 different women working front desk when we checked in, but both did everything in their power to check us in early after our weary travels.  Wouldn't think twice about where to stay next time in the city.",5,2016,07,25
202,Classic,"I stayed here with my husband for 2 nights in a deluxe room.
The hotel is in a fantastic location, just a short walk to lots of bars, restaurants and shops.
The room was beautifully decorated, we didn't have a view from ours but it didn't bother us. The bed was so comfy we just melted into it.
The staff were very friendly and couldn't do enough for us.
The breakfast was amazing with a wide selection including smoothies and honey on the comb.
The hotel overall was tasteful and classic.
We will definitely stay here again. ",5,2016,07,25
202,Lovely hotel,My husband and I stayed here when we booked our trip through Costco. We had a great experience. It is located directly across from Temple Bar and next to Trinity College. The staff is friendly and courteous. They gave us a may of the city and when they found out it was our anniversary they sent us cheesecake and other goodies. Would definitely stay again and recommend to others.,5,2016,07,25
202,good hotel & good location,"Was in Ireland during Thanksgiving for a U2 concert, and we enjoyed this hotel! The rooms were nice and in a great location. Everything seemed to be within walking distance! Concierge was great and staff was accommodating. Rooms were very nice and well kept- pretty big too! Would definitely recommend this hotel.",4,2016,07,25
202,Truly Heavenly,"The Westin is in an old building that used to be a bank. It appears that the rooms are configured differently. Upon arrival, we were assigned a fourth floor room that looked out at the side of a tile roof. The front desk graciously sent someone to show us two more rooms. The room we selected was lovely with a small sitting room that looked out onto the atrium. Rooms were clean, nicely appointed and of course the bed was ""heavenly"". The breakfast was excellent and the service throughout the hotel was outstanding. The management is doing a great job!! Hotel location is central to many of the best sites in Dublin. Highly recommend!!!",5,2016,07,24
202,Afternoon tea ,"We came to this hotel for the afternoon tea on a rainy day. My bf chose the modern option and i sticked with traditional afternoon tea. The set came beautifully with three levels of sandwiches, sweet stuff, and bread/scones. We really enjoyed it. Especially the restaurant locates on first floor in the middle of the hotel. You can see the blue sky with the glass roof and hotel rooms boarding around. The chairs are very comfortable. Nice place to spend your afternoon with your beloveds. Very relaxed",4,2016,07,24
202,"Beautiful hotel, central location","This hotel ticks all the boxes one would expect from the Westin name.  The rooms are spacious and well appointed and the public areas are beautiful.

My room was at the front of the hotel, looking over the busy Westmoreland St, towards Temple Bar.  I had no issue with noise and enjoyed watching the coming and goings on the street below.

The main downside of this hotel is its location.  Its certainly exceptionally central and that will appeal to many (especially those who want to experience Temple Bar). Unfortunately central Dublin has not fared well over the past few years.  Visitors may see drug addicts and petty crime in this area - its now sadly common - and may not feel very safe at night.

That said, the hotel is easily one of the better options in Dublin city center, and I would stay here again.",4,2016,07,24
202,Great everything!,"Stayed before and after travelling throughout Ireland. The hotel reception could not have been more welcoming. Concierge 5 star. Our first room was beautiful. Street view, sunny and clean. Restaurant delightful, very popular with women who have tea in the afternoon. Our second room did not have the view and was smaller. However, it was clean and welcoming. 
The bar in the basement is like one that I have never seen. Fresh herbs, ready for your drink of choice. Unique bar.

The desk staff were so helpful to me, Sylvia in particular. There were about 5 times when I needed advice/help. She literally read my mind. Making phone calls, checking the computer without me asking.

The location is perfect. Walking everywhere. 

I would stay at this hotel on every visit. Absolutely wonderful.",5,2016,07,23
202,Beautiful traditional hotel,"Both my wife and I enjoyed our stay for the weekend. The hotel is excellent, immaculate and great feel to it. From the concierge to the friendly reception staff we were made to feel very welcome throughout our stay. The dinning room is lovely and food was excellent. The room was quiet considering how central the hotel was. I would recommend this hotel to anyone.",5,2016,07,23
202,Beautiful hotel for our honeymoon ,The staff at the Westin Dublin was exceptional. They were super helpful in making recommendations and making reservations for us as well was setting up an airport transfer. They even had a bottle of wine in our room and towels folded like swans because it was our honeymoon. I stay mostly at Starwood hotels and I felt right at home at the Westin Dublin. It's also a great location and within walking distance of a lot of attractions. I highly recommend it!,5,2016,07,23
202,Only ok,"Stayed at this hotel with my husband a few weeks ago , reception staff not very nice , we got a terrible room with no windows , when we went back down to complain Nicola at reception said we should have paid more money to get a room with Windows ! We were horrified as we had paid a really expensive price for the room . Good location that's about it ! Never stay there again!",3,2016,07,23
202,Very comfortable stay!,My husband and I spent two nights at the Westin in Dublin.  They were able to get us in our room by 11:00 am after our transatlantic flight.   Very quiet! Lovely bar downstairs with fantastic cocktails .  Close to Temple Bar area.  Very nice breakfast!  It is pricey but we would do it again!,4,2016,07,23
202,A good city centre hotel,"I am an HH, IHG and Accor member and this is my first stay in a SPG hotel. The Westin is very convenient, near Trinity College opposite Temple Bar area, a short walk to the river Liffey and to many of the well known tourist sites.
Our check in was quick and efficient.
We had a junior suite, which was a very large room, with a good size sitting area and a very spacious bathroom with a really good walk in shower. 
All of the fittings were of high quality, the wardrobe was a good size and there was reasonable drawer space.
Taking all things into consideration, it was one of the best rooms we have had for sometime.
The Westin was also generous with a bottle of wine, a couple of free miniatures, and daily bottled water etc.
The housekeeping was excellent and toiletries were plentiful.
All the staff were friendly and helpful, and the service we received at all times was first class.
There was a good breakfast choice, and we now love Bircher muesli!
Our only criticism is the poor dining options in the evening.
The restaurant is not open for dinner and the lounge only serves cold snack type meals after 18.30.
The Mint bar does serve hot bar food, but it is a fairly short menu, OK perhaps if there only one or two nights.
The Mint bar is quite dark, pity the menu is not in slightly larger print for us oldies! I struggled to read it in the gloom.
It maybe the hotel thinks that everyone will want to dine out, but the pubs, and restaurants we looked at were packed out, so we preferred the calm of the hotel.
We were surprised that the hotel does not cater very well for evening dining, hence my marking down to four stars.
Why could not the Mint bar menu choice be slightly increased, and why cannot hot food be served in the lounge? 
Despite my criticism, we did enjoy the Westin.

",4,2016,07,23
202,Great Hotel,"The staff at the Westin Dublin was great.  The  Concierge was great in booking tours for us, getting us a taxi to the airport, etc.  Our room was quiet, very well furnished and very roomy.    The hotel is very conveniently located.  We would definitely stay there again.",5,2016,07,22
202,An Upscale Hotel,"Ended my trip to Ireland with one night at the Westin.  After ten days in small B&Ss, we splurged and used Starwood points for a deluxe night.  Any three of my B&B rooms would have fit into my Westin Room. 

It is an upscale hotel Americans are used to in big cities in the U.S.  Great location, nice staff, etc.  It's what you expect from an expensive hotel.",5,2016,07,22
202,"Well located address, lobby size was restricted","As with all Westin hotels, they are housed in grand old buildings.  Westin Dublin is no exception.   As a result, because of space restriction, the lobby was a bit tight.   But the bar area at the mezzanine level at the Atrium was spacious and comfortable.   We had a room facing the Atrium on the 1st floor.  Privacy was an issue from time to time.  However there was no noise from the bar area.   

The hotel is superbly located.  A few minutes walk to Trinity College and the main shopping street of Grafton Street.  Cross the road to Temple Bar for all the nigh activities of restaurants and bars.  Five minutes walk on the other direction to cross the River Leaffy to the shopping area of O'Connell/Henry Streets shopping streets.  The concierge organised restaurant bookings for us during our 4 days stay at great local eateries.  The Winding Stairs was our favourite restaurant.

The breakfast room on the ground floor has a good view of Westmoreland Street.  It offers a great selection but there is no egg station.  So fried eggs and omelettes have to be ordered from the waiting team.  Service was excellent with the quintessential Irish charm and wit.",5,2016,07,22
202,"4.5 stars, plus a great location","I withhold the fifth star only because it is what you expect for the money. It met expectations, but didn't really exceed. I'd give 4.5 stars if I could. The room was lovely and we had a 3rd bed brought in and there was still plenty of space. We were there on the Anniversary weekend of the Revolution -- so maybe that's why it was more expensive than we'd planned -- but it was great service, great staff, very clean, and an ideal location for sure.",4,2016,07,21
202,Dishonest staff,"this is our 3rd stay in last 18months at dublin.  Nice rooms.  we often stay at Westin wherever traveling.   but very poor experience.  dishonest staff.
1.  one of our bags telescoping handle was ruined.   I personally loaded our bags into rental car and took them out at the hotel for their person to load on his trolley.   AS soon as i sat them on the sidewalk, i went to front desk.   the Westin person took to room ahead of us, and was exiting when we arrived.  NOTHING WAS SAID ABOUT DAMAGE.
but 30 min later when reported it, there was denial.  i explained that i had handled the luggaged into the car and out and all fine.  no matter.   i was promised an investigation.
of course, conclusion was not their fault.   THAT IS IMPOSSIBLE.
2.  in the rush to the airport the next am, i forgot my shaving kit etc in the bathroom.
i wrote them.   they said nothing was found.
I guess the shaving kit and cologne etc. just walked out on its own.

Simply disappointing and dishonest.  Will not return.",4,2016,07,21
202,11 Days of Pleasure,"Had the pleasure of staying here for 11 days recently.  The experience was as expected excellent, from the first greet by the Door man (by Name), through the stay, to the early morning farewell.  
The room we were given was excellent (writer's room) with a great bed, which meant a great nights sleep.  We were lucky to get a room with a balcony and spent pleasant times there watching/hearing Dublin.",5,2016,07,20
202,Perfect hotel,"The location is really fantastic.  Rooms were much bigger than expected.  Outstanding and very helpful staff.  The Mint Bar is also excellent.  A great choice for a hotel in Dublin. And typical Weston beds, which are great.",5,2016,07,20
202,"Charming Hotel, good location!","We were lucky enough to get on the top floor and get a balcony which overlooked the city.  Sicne it stays light til almost 10pm, it was delightful to sit outside in the cool evening to see the sights and listen to the sounds of Dublin.  Our room is just charming -- reminds me of a small cottage and the bed, Well, what can I say -- Just Heavenly.    The staff here is very friendly and helpful.",5,2016,07,20
202,"Buttoned down, professional service at a first class property","The Westin Dublin provides a wonderful experience.  The staff is friendly and also very efficient. They go out of their way to be helfpul.  The facilities are meet expectations for a high end property - nice, relatively spacious rooms, good restaurant, great bar in the cellar (Mint?) and servicable exercise room.  The location is great for either business or leisure - right on St. Stephen's Green.  Construction in front is a temporary inconvenience.  Overall, a great base for business or pleasure in Dublin.",5,2016,07,20
202,Great hotel ,"This is s really nice spot. Well appointed rooms. Very comfortable and great service.
I don't usually stay here as I find the location a little in between for me. 
Was very impressed by the techie bits our room had at the time. 
I prefer to stay around Ballsbridge or Stephen Green/ Grafton st location wise though.",5,2016,07,20
202,Excellent location,"We stayed here for a friends wedding - excellent location close to restaurants and nightlife. Walking distance to so many things to do and see - we had good weather so it was a pleasure. 

Our room was quiet and comfy. The hotel staff were super helpful, the breakfast was lavish and had some Irish additions which were great. 

It's not cheap to stay here and my only comment would be that at 3 pm after a day out walking around and lunching - our room had not been serviced..  Also, no turn down.",5,2016,07,20
202,Family of 6 Vacation to Dublin,"Well, I took my wife and 4 kids to ireland for 2 weeks.  I need a Vacation from my vacation! Kids Ages 3,5,9,14...whoa.  Our bags were delayed 24 hours, so spend 50 Euros per person affected as soon as possible and keep receipts of everything.  We stayed at the Westin, which is by all the good shopping for mom and next to everything needed for children. The hotel was just fine, nothing really fancy and the bell man Mo is wonderful.  He somehow loaded our car with all our bus and still had room for everyone.  Amazing!  Internet was free, and breakfast was expensive. Starbucks around the corner and various cafes for a cheaper breakfast.  Kids love the ""Hop on Hop off Bus"" which will take you to all kids stuff.  Would take about 2 days to do everything on the bus route (zoo, parks, free ice cream and beer at certain stops).  We rented a car, which is scary, but doable.  All cars are manual and driving on the ""wrong side"" in tight scenarios.  Go slow and be careful, the native drivers are fast but very good typically.  Any cars with a red L (learner) are new drivers.  They should have a big red F for foreign drivers ;).  IF you rent a car, take the kids to a castle or outdoor park near dublin, just google.  The one place I would definitely take my younger children (ages 3-15) is called Slieve Gullion Giants Lair.  Google it, its about 1 hour outside of dublin on the way to belfast.  This place is awesome and FREE!  Full day of hiking through the forest and checking out elaborate fairy gardens, fairy hideouts, zip lines, playgrounds, and beautiful photo ops.  We went when it was rainy and it was still the best portion of the trip for kids.",5,2016,07,20
202,A comfortable stay with great customer service.,The hotel has a great location in Dublin. Right around the corner from Trinity College. All hotel staff we interacted with were friendly and helpful. Breakfast was very good. Room was spacious and quiet.,5,2016,07,17
202,Great all around,"We stayed here for one night, and it was great all around. The location can't be beat. The rooms were very large. The staff delivered amazing service. We requested adjoining rooms for the kids, and the hotel provided that with no problem.",5,2016,07,17
202,Great hotel,"We stayed here for 3 nights and absolutely loved the property.  It is located across from Trinity College.  

Spent one evening in the Mint Bar debating with college professors and teaching the Irish bartender how to make a Texas drink called a Mexican Martini.  He made the drink 1st try from scratch to perfection.  ",5,2016,07,16
202,Great Hotel in the Heart of Dublin,The Westin Dublin is a great hotel in the heart of Dublin. The accommodations and services provided were outstanding. The food offered was fantastic. I would highly recommend staying at the Westin if you are going to Dublin.,5,2016,07,11
202,Awesome!,"Stayed in this gorgeous hotel with my wife and 2 kids for 3 days. Brilliant experience, really. 
From the time of check-in till you check-out (and even after..) the smoothness and loveliness of the staff are the key word. 
Absolutely perfect location in the very heart of Dublin..  We stayed in The College Suite. Wow! Really uniquely stunning, full of history, and balconies..
I spend  more than 100 nights a year in hotels, and I should say this was my favourite!
The breakfast and the Mint bar food were excellent too. 
HIGHLY recommended. ",5,2016,07,11
202,Great location,"I try not to discourage people from staying places, but if you are driving into Dublin to stay at the Westin, you may want to stay someplace else until the subway construction is done. If you are driving, make sure you have a city map or your google maps is working-neither of which we were able to use.  When we were there the end of June, where Dame Street turns into College Street they generally only allow buses and taxis through.  Having spent 1 1/2 hours driving around, we finally were able to ask a cop.  He said it was just up the street but we would have to go around as it was only accessible from this side by taxis and buses.  It literally took as another 1 1/2 hours to go down the river far enough where we could turn around to hopefully have our GPS bring us up  from behind the hotel.From Pearse Street, it took us back to the river and  ended up routing us right back through Dame Street.  Fortunately, another cop was now there.  He let us through.  If we'd have a street map, we would have seen that Pearse Street also turns into College Street which would have allowed us onto Westmorland where the hotel is.  At least all the construction doesn't affect your walking around.

Other than the construction, the hotel is in a great location.  Two minutes away from the entrance to Trinity College, just down the street from Grafton Street and Temple Bar.

The hotel itself is very nice except our room was kind of goofy small.  When you came in, there was a small seating area and the bathroom.  You had to walk up a few stairs to get to the bed, which was fine except the TV is up there so if you wanted to watch TV your only option was to sit on the bed.  Of course the bed was Westin comfortable.   My only real complaint about the room was the shower.  It is one of those rain showers, but this one had so little pressure it was like showering under a leaky faucet.  The breakfast is the usual fare of rolls, eggs, meats juices etc.  It was on the nicer side. The staff is incredibly friendly-as is everyone we encountered in Ireland-except for the first policeman!  I'd stay there again when the construction is done.",4,2016,07,10
202,"Perfect Location, Excellent Staff","The location is perfect for exploring Dublin on foot- we walked everywhere, from Trinity College, Temple Bar, the Abbey Theatre, Grafton street, Merrion Square and Georgian Dublin.  Although the hotel is close to the night life of Temple Bar our room was silent and we felt removed from the center of the city.  The staff were excellent, lending us an umbrella for the week we were there.  They also sent us goodies twice since it was our honeymoon.  I would stay here again if I returned to Dublin!",5,2016,07,10
202,Great hotel,Great central location. The hotel staff was very friendly and helpful. Rooms were very nice and we loved the connecting rooms for our kids. Right next to trinity college so easy walk to shopping and places to eat. The atrium bar was great and we loved the afternoon tea. The mint bar was also nice for drinks. We didn't eat dinner at the hotel. Breakfast was a little slow for menu items but all the food was great. ,5,2016,07,09
202,All about location,"The hotel is located across the street from the Temple Bar area as well as a block away from Trinity College and the Book of Kells. And the shopping along Grafton Street is no more than a 10-minute walk. 

The rooms were comfortable with soft pillowy beds but some may have odd layouts (it is a historic building). Bathrooms were large but the tiles need some maintenance and had some black spots in the grout. It was a nice touch having a North American AC outlet underneath the desk. Attended a dinner in the main banquet hall, which was stunning, with an excellent buffet (excellently cooked pasta). Service was attentive, our departure was so early that we wouldn't make breakfast but the staff kindly prepared a cold takeaway breakfast for us.",5,2016,07,09
202,Location and Service,"We had a fabulous stay at the Westin.  The location of the hotel is the best, so central to everything!  The service was wonderful, we arrived early and they accommodated by getting us a room within the hour.  We had a fabulous breakfast every morning with great service.  Our room had a private balcony overlooking trinity college which was lovely.  The rooms are modern with lovely bedding and comfortable beds.  The bathroom are updated and comfortable.  The rooms have every amenity including a safe and the staff left us truffles and baileys one night as a treat.  The wifi is free and the gym is also very modern.  Overall 5 star experience and we would recommend without hesitation!",5,2016,07,07
202,Recommend. Excellent location.  ,"

Massive construction projects outside the hotel...

Bottom Line..
Recommend
",4,2016,07,07
202,Great service,This was a very busy weekend in Dublin as the US Vice President was in town and visiting the immediate area. Plus there has been some construction on the roads (Luas) for a few months. The staff are great at making people feel very welcome. Stephen at the front door is one of the best ambassadors not just for the hotel but for Dublin in general. Breakfast is very nice. Don't miss having tea. Very central.,5,2016,07,06
202,Perfect Dublin Location!,"The Westin Dublin is a Beautiful old building that matched perfectly with our view of Trinity College from the window. There were framed replicas of a couple of pages of the Book of Kells in the room which made the view even more special. (The real BoK can be seen, along with the College's extraordinary library, with a visit.)The marble bathroom was gigantic! Everyone working at the hotel was friendly and went out of their way to answer questions or take care of any requests. Super comfortable bed! Great staff! Helpful and Friendly! They really made us feel welcome and comfortable. The hotel is in the middle of everything! College, Museums, Shops, Restaurants, you name it.  Refreshing citrus water and cucumber water with cookies welcome you when you enter the lobby. We enjoyed being here and felt it was a good choice!",4,2016,07,04
202,Just the best!,I cannot say enough positive things about Westin Dublin. My suite was ready when I arrived. My meeting at Trinity College was ony a five minute walk - in heavy traffic. Little did I know that the restaurant in Dublin close at 10:00 pm (the pubs are open much later but no food) so the room service was a life saver. Location is great. Rooms are immaculate and the service outstanding. What's not to like.,5,2016,07,04
202,Afternoon tea/coffee,"I had been at a select wedding banquet in this hotel a couple of years ago, so this Spring with my daughter, we chose to visit the tea-room in the early afternoon. It was drizzling outside, so the sight of a bright fire was welcoming and an indication of the smiling service and the atmosphere. Clearly, there was a place where guests take their time.
And it was not too expensive at all.",5,2016,07,04
202,Afternoon Tea Birthday Treat,"I spent the most amazing afternoon enjoying a gluten free Afternoon Tea with my Mum & niece.  This was a birthday present given to me by my niece back in January but we only got to use it today.  I could not recommend this hotel more for the ambience, staff & food.  Nothing was an effort for the staff and they were all very nice and happy.  Our server Marianna was one of the best waitresses I have ever dealt with, she surprised me with a gluten free little cake with candle so I could finish my afternoon off in style :)  Would definitely go back and hopefully stay in this beautiful hotel.",5,2016,07,03
202,"Nice Westin, Friendly Staff, Terrific Location","We stayed for a few days in June. The rooms are in excellent condition, the staff is friendly and helpful. We had a nice large bath in our deluxe room class. Many posters recommend the hotel due to its location and you can see why when you get there - it couldn't be better. Easy access to the main tourist sites, though a bit longer for seeking out quiet neighborhoods. We recommend the hotel for its typical Westin quality, excellent (almost like new) rooms, and it's location. ",5,2016,07,03
202,Beautiful modern hotel ,"Had an amazing stay at the westin with my husband. The service is impeccable, the surroundings are beautiful and the atmosphere is lovely. Nothing we asked was too much hassle for the staff. Would definitely recommend afternoon tea here also, a really lovely experience that has to be done at least once. The atrium area is amazing. ",5,2016,07,03
202,You will be glad you stayed!,"We stayed for 2 nights. The room was quite large as was the modern bathroom. Being in the city center I expected smaller rooms. In fact, this Westin exceeded my expectations in so many ways. Even though I am a SPG member, I don't think that's why the concierge and front desk went out of their way to be helpful. Everyone seemed to truly enjoy their jobs. Breakfast was delish (we both had the full Irish and then some), the gym was clean, bright and spacious with modern equipment. When I called to have something brought to the room, it came within 3 minutes. Our view was looking over the city, across from Trinity College. Beautiful! Centrally located. I highly recommend staying here. You won't regret it.",5,2016,07,02
202,Short business stay - Great location & Service,"I went to Dublin on a short business trip. I booked Westin via Amex Platinum Service & as a SPG Gold member. The hotel is very central with many shops and great bars/restaurants within a walking distance. Although the room was on the small size side comparing to other 5* hotels, the bathroom is quite spacious and the room is equipped  with everything you would expect. Good wifi connectivity. The Mint Bar, at the hotel basement is very good and the Bar-lady (Hannah) was very helpful and provided great service. Breakfast was nice too - Good selection of hot and cold food as well as fresh fruit. Will certainly go back on my next trip.",5,2016,07,01
202,"Great hotel, excellent location!",Stayed at the Westin on a girls trip to Ireland. We had a great experience. Beds were fantastic. We enjoyed the afternoon tea by the fire. The location can't be beat. You are right at the end of Temple Bar but we didn't hear any street noise from our room. There was construction on the street but the hotel made it practically unnoticeable. Staff was friendly and accommodating. I highly recommend!,5,2016,07,01
202,Great hotel in the heart of Dublin!,Great stay at the Westin Dublin! Great location and an excellent hotel. Very close to Temple Bar area and great shopping and dining.  The bathrooms were some of the nicest we have seen in a Westin or any other hotel!,5,2016,06,30
202,Excellent choice,The Westin Dublin is wonderfully located - walking distance to most major monuments - St Patricks Cathedral - Trinity College and Temple Bar....Comfortable bed - friendly and helpful staff.  Concierge made excellent recommendations.  This is my second visit to the Westin Dublin - Love the beautiful fresh flowers!  Take the drive out to Wicklow and Glendalough,5,2016,06,29
202,Wonderful staff!,"We spent four nights here in June; our first stay here, even though we travel to Ireland every few years. The location is really super, walking distance to all the sights of Dublin and, since we love to walk in this lovely city, it suited us perfectly to stay here. The Concierges were all helpful with directions and restaurant reservations. Our room was attractive and, of course, we slept exceptionally well in the famous ""heavenly bed."" We enjoyed a tea in the Atrium Lounge and a casual dinner in the Mint Bar. Both offered polite and prompt service. Would definitely recommend it!",4,2016,06,27
202,The Match!,"I just want to write this review to say how comfortable we were made feel watching the Ireland V France match in the bar.
We had some lovely small plate food,,,we are going back for lunch,,,and lovely service from the bar staff as they came to our table during the match to see if we had what we needed,,,just to say the lunch looked amazing and the price I thought was very good for such a beautiful hotel... such a great place so don't forget it if looking for a little piece of luxury in the busy Dublin City,,",5,2016,06,27
202,Nothing other to say than its AMAZING,"Having just come back through the doors from a stay in Dublin, I had to write this review. 

This hotel is AMAZING. The staff are attentive, pleasant, courteous and will go above and beyond to ensure that your visit is as perfect as it can be. 

We also had afternoon tea which is out of this world! Yes everything about this hotel is relatively expensive, but you pay for what you get.",5,2016,06,27
202,Location,"A great location next to Trinity College and the centre of town. Only about a hundred pubs and restaurants within easy walking distance. 
Hotel is in Starwood Group. Has a large bar in basement, The Mint Bar. They serve bar food and drinks. It is usually crowded and loud. Atrium serves a limited menu in the evenings. The Exchange Restaurant is open for breakfast and lunch. 
Also a great location if you're using Dublin as a pre-cruise kick off site. 
Worth a stay. 
Enjoy. ",5,2016,06,26
202,"Great location, great service","Everything is great with this hotel. The location is excellent: very close to Temple Bar area and other Dublin attractions. Room is spacious and clean, bed is comfortable. The breakfast buffet is excellent. Staff is friendly. Highly recommended -- would definitely visit again.",5,2016,06,25
202,Expensive but location and Service are excellent,"Central Dublin location with handicap accessible facilities and rooms make this Starwood (Westin) hotel well worth it's price.From the moment the doorman greets you to the moment you leave the staff is always attentive. The Breakfast buffet has Irish specialties from Smoked Herring ,Irish smoked salmon, sweets, assorted breads,Irish Rasher bacon and sausage. Room Wifi works great also. I would definitely rate this Westin as one of the best in the Starwood chain of hotels.",5,2016,06,25
202,A step above most Westins,"We stayed at the Dublin Westin for several nights in March 2016.  We often stay at Westin hotels, but really, this particular location was just a bit better quality than expected.  The service level was high (and quick!) and the staff more than eager to assist in any way possible.  The rooms were very spacious, the food excellent and the location was absolutely perfect - right in the middle of everything!  Walking distance to just about anywhere.  We'd read good reviews of this hotel before arriving, but even our high expectations were surpassed.  Kudos to the staff on an excellent job.",5,2016,06,25
202,"Beautiful Hotel, Great Brand, Some Disappointment","The hotel is absolutely lovely and the breakfast was wonderful, however, the level of services left a bit to be desired.  We stayed at the Westin for six nights and had one issue early in our stay that had an impact on our entire visit and another issue that was just par for the course. 

On the second day of our stay, we did some shopping and clerk at the store forgot to place an item in our bag. Graciously, store (Ted Baker) personnel brought the item, is a clearly marked, Ted Baker bag to our hotel and left it with the front desk. When we returned to retrieve the item the front desk personnel indicated it was never delivered. We spent the next few days going back and forth with the hotel over the lost item. Personnel from Ted Baker finally had to come to the Westin, review CCTV tapes with hotel personnel and prove they dropped off the garment. The whole fiasco was entirely the hotel's fault but we and the nice people are Ted Baker were made to feel like we made the whole thing up. Not only was the blame shifted, we never received any kind apology until we were rushing out the door to catch a taxi to the airport - the hotel manager was chasing us down to offer a room upgrade the next time we come to Dublin.

The second problem we encountered was in the lounge trying to order cocktails. After a solid 10 minutes of no indication of service by anyone (the long may have had 5 - 6 customers, 2 bartenders and 2 servers) i approached the bar to ask if they had particular rum. The person behind the bar did not know but would find out and come to our table. another 10 minutes, they had the rum, we waited and waited for our drink - had to leave...Indicative of the service at this hotel.

Absolutely our worst Westin experience ever - the beauty of the hotel and the breakfast allowed an overall average rating...",3,2016,06,23
202,The Best of Ireland,"I cannot recommend the Westin Dublin high enough... What a Wonderful place to stay.  As noted by many other reviewers, the staff makes this place so special.  Everyone we encountered was eager to make sure our needs were met and our stay was perfect.  The rooms were always clean and very comfortable.  As usual the Westin heavenly beds are the best.  The shower was most enjoyable.. great water pressure which you don't always find.  A Great location which is convenient to shopping and the sites.  The Food was excellent.  This is rated as one of the best vacations we have had.",5,2016,06,23
202,The ideal location in Dublin and it may be the best Westin we've every stayed in.,"We arrived early due to travel and got a 10a check in and was offered for minimal $$ an upgrade to a suite. 

The room was incredible, well designed, comfortable, great bedding and amenities.

The staff was extremely friendly and helpful. The concierge very knowledgable.

The location is across the street from Trinity College and adjacent to the best shopping and restaurant area in Dublin.

Couldn't ask for more.",5,2016,06,22
202,Perfect location and impeccable staff,"This hotel was impeccable. Perfect location, it is central to just about everything. This is one of if not the best hotels I have stayed at in Europe. The staff went above and beyond to accommodate every need we had. I wanted to especially thank Mo at the concierge desk. Weather he was at the concierge desk or at the door he was always willing to help and provide assistance. He was very knowledgeable regarding all the attractions and provided prefect directions. He is definitely an asset to the Westin. I will absolutely return to this hotel on my next trip to Dublin.",5,2016,06,22
202,Heavenly beds!!,This is one of the best hotels ive ever stayed in.Very easy to get to from the airport and central to everything.We stayed in a triple room which had a view over the main street and plenty of room for all of us to get ready to hit the town.The bathroom was spacious and the toiletries were a nice touch.The coffee machine in the room was great and very quick to make a pot.We ate in The Atrium bar the first night which was tasty and not too expensive.The Dj downstairs in The Mint Bar was fantastic too.We didn't have the hotel breakfast but our friends did and said it was delicious.I hope I get the opportunity to come back.,5,2016,06,20
202,Best location in town,"As SPG members, we picked this location as the only SPG property in town, but we were not disappointed.  After a late arrival, we awoke the following morning, opened a map, and found that we were within a block of many of the major sites and tours that we wanted to see!  Almost everything including great restaurants, breweries, and a distillery were within a mile radius of this place.  The hotel itself is well-appointed with a good bar downstairs, comfortable and quiet rooms, and very friendly staff.  I would highly recommend a stay here when you visit Dublin!",5,2016,06,19
202,Great location,"Stayed one night and found this hotel to be of a great standard.

There are a number of places to drink and eat and they are all excellent.

The bed was super comfortable and the room very quiet.

Location is very central and Temple Bar across the road. Steps from major tourist attractions.

The hotel is a 3 minute walk from where the airport bus stop is, so easy to get to.",5,2016,06,19
202,Very nice hotel in a good location ,"Very nice hotel in a good location.  Service is generally very friendly and attentive with exception of the breakfast where they seem to be very short staffed beginning with the hostess who for some reason has the full responsibility of checking guests in by obtaining their room numbers, seating them and then taking their coffee orders.  Meanwhile, a line forms at the checkin for breakfast simply because everyone is waiting for her to return to the reception desk.  When I gave this feedback to the front desk, they claimed they were I unusually busy ... However, very few of the tables were taken (maybe 30% at most) so this explanation made no sense.  Other than clearly mismanaged breakfast dining room, everything else in the hotel was lovely and would recommend it highly.",4,2016,06,19
202,A great spot to get over jet lag...,"GREAT location - right next to the Temple Bar area - for restaurants and nightlife.  We stayed here (with points!) our first two nights in Ireland in an effort to sleep off the jet lag in their Heavenly Bed - which was wonderful!  There's also a great bathtub to relax your muscles after walking all over Dublin :-) 

Had we not had points ... I think this place is a bit outrageously priced for what you get. There are a ton of hotels to choose from in the area that are more reasonable (we changed hotels our third night in Dublin).

The bartenders in the bar are great - SUPER friendly and knowledgeable about Dublin (and whisky!), though drinks are completely overpriced (as they are in much of Dublin ... but even moreso here).",4,2016,06,17
202,Excellent place to stay in Dublin,Very nice hotel with friendly staff. Rooms are functional and beds comfortable. Lobby is a little dated but patio cafe is great. Breakfast is excellent and location is one of the best - right across from Trinity college. Would not hesitate to stay at this hotel again.,4,2016,06,16
202,Perfect start to our vacation,"We loved our stay at the Westin Dublin. It was perfectly located, not too close to all the noisy areas but all within walking distance. We loved the outstanding customer service and we felt they went above and beyond what we normally experience with other properties. Thank you, it was a very nice start to our vacation.",5,2016,06,15
202,Fabulous!,"It was our first time staying in the westin and I must say it was fabulous. Our room was a two storey suite with a balcony, stunning! We didn't dine here but breakfast was full of choice which was great.  Location is excellent. Really enjoyed our stay.  ",5,2016,06,15
202,Perfection and faultless,"I cannot thank the staff here at The Westin and especially Eilish Kealey and her events team for all their help during our 3 day work conference.    They bent over backwards to ensure that we were looked after and didnt want for anything.  The location is perfect, right amongst everything you need to see if you are here for a few days.   The food we had was outstanding and such a huge variety, with different menus to choose from.  I would not hesitate to recommend having your work conference at this hotel, it was just perfect. Thank you.",5,2016,06,15
202,"Unresponsive service, substandard front desk staff","In June 2016 we spent three nights at the Westin Dublin Hotel, in an expensive (621 euros per night) suite (the Oscar Wilde Suite) on the second floor. The suite is a two-story room, incorporating a spiral staircase to connect the lower bedroom/bathroom floor with a relatively small office space (desk, armchair) above. No breakfasts were provided. We had stayed at this same hotel almost two years earlier, and the responsive service we received during that stay encouraged us to return.

Now, however, it is a different hotel. The staff at the front desk were always efficiently cold and mumbled. The shower door leaked a lot of water onto the bathroom floor, leading us to use a handful of towels to mop that up. We contacted the front desk first thing in the morning to undo our ""green choice"" so that we would receive replacement towels right away. On that day (our second day, our first full day in Dublin), we returned to the room mid-afternoon to find that maid service had not cleaned the room, emptied waste baskets or made the bed. The front desk attributed this failure to our ""green choice"" at check-in -- obviously the front desk failed to document or remember our request for that same morning. It gets much worse.

The concierges were friendly enough but steered us in real-tim to restaurants that were closed. When I stopped at the front desk to discuss room service hours so I could be sure to arrange for food before my early morning departure for the airport on the last day, the front desk staff gave me wrong information -- saying room service routinely began at 6 am when we subsequently discovered it doesn't begin until 6:30 am (after our leave time). The Mint Bar has interesting decor but is under-staffed and we waited for long periods on several occasions to get food or drink.

While the Westin Dublin location is central, the lack of attention to service basics, the failure of the front desk to address these articulated problems at the time despite several approaches, and the minimalist response of the Manager by email after my return home (""sorry you didn't enjoy your stay"") were far far below basic hotel standards. I don't expect my service to be 2x or 3x better just because I stayed in a very expensive room, but there was effectively no service beyond the perfunctory.",1,2016,06,15
202,Perfect spot,"Went to the Westin to meet a colleague for lunch in the Atrium. It's s great spot for a discreet meeting

What can I say? Perfect location, excellent food, flawless and attentive but not intrusive service.

This is a great location and good value too 

This is how to do service people...",5,2016,06,13
202,Excellent stay at the Westin in Dublin,"Thoroughly enjoyed my stay at the Westin in Dublin. The team were considerate and professional while the rooms were better than expected. As a wheelchair user, they were accommodating and aware of my needs. Stephen Q. was an amazing concierge with a smile always on his face and perfect direction for our desires (restaurants, shops, etc). I would not hesitate to stay there again or to refer friends/family as well.",5,2016,06,13
202,Air conditioning problem,"The Westin is a beautiful hotel perfectly located for visiting Dublin. In addition, the staff was outstanding and the breakfast was wonderful.  I would have rated this hotel a five, BUT, the air-conditioning in our room was not working.  When we arrived we set the thermostat on the slowest setting with the fan on high.  We returned four hours later with the room being uncomfortably warm and humid for us to sleep.  The staff was responsive but there was no one on duty to fix it, so they brought us a fan.  They later offered to change our room, but since we were only staying one night and were settled and undressed, we declined.  I did appreciate that they also offered another room for us to simply sleep, rather than change rooms, although we opted to stay.  My complaint about the hotel is that it is hard to imagine that they were unaware before our arrival that the air conditioning wasn't working, and if they weren't aware, they should have been since there was a significant temperature and humidity difference between the hallway and our room.",3,2016,06,12
202,What a Westin should be,My wife and I stayed at the Westin Dublin for three nights using Starwood points.  Sometimes using points results in a less than stellar experience.  Not so with the Westin Dublin.  From the start we were treated exceptionally well including a room upgrade for being a Gold Card member.  The concierge and doorman took care of our voluminous luggage courteously and promptly.  Our room was ready for early arrival.  The front desk staff member was both warm and courteous.  The room was large and well appointed.  The bathroom was exceptionally pleasant and spacious.  The bed was the most comfortable of our entire three week trip that included stays at nine hotels and inns.  The breakfasts were delicious with a large variety of cold and hot served offerings. The staff were unfailingly polite (though some could use a little more training about things to see and do in Dublin including restaurant recommendations).  The Mint Bar offered great drinks and atmosphere and a very competent bartender who succeeded in creating the best smoky Old Fashioned ever. And the concierge was very helpful navigating our car rental including delivery to the hotel and loading it up for our trip through the Irish seaside.  We return there for a night before heading back home so hope the extremely high quality of service and consideration continues.  Best Westin experience ever.,5,2016,06,11
202,Excellent room and breakfqst,"The Westin is Dublin's price leader alongside The Merrion. It is pricey but you get what you pay for. My room and bathroom were spacious, the bed was incredibly comfortable and the breakfast buffet selection had a wide choice of fresh and cooked dishes. Importantly, as the hotel is adjacent to Temple Bar, my room was quiet verging on the silent!",5,2016,06,11
202,"Great hotel, nice location and helpful staff","This hotel is located in a central location close to everything. Arrived early May 29 after an overnite trip and although the room couldnt be ready due to a full Saturday night, the staff put a priority on it and we were able to get in early. We were upgraded to the top floor with a balcony ( I am Starwood Platinum). Check-in was fast and efficient. Room was clean and beds comfortable as with all Westins. What really made the experience fantastic was the help we received from the doormen and the concierges. No matter how many times we went for help in retaurants, directions, train schedules to other close by locations, they went out of their way to help. A great stay",5,2016,06,11
202,Lovely central hotel ,"Stayed with work at this hotel 
Really lovely hotel recently been refurbished to a high standard 
Really clean and light rooms 
Very modern on the inside -used to be a bank back in the day 
Friendly staff
Great breakfast 
Mint bar in the basement is great - mixology 
Major Road works at the moment outside 
But you can't hear it inside 
Worth a visit 
",5,2016,06,10
202,Classy and Comfortable...,"After a long, overseas flight, the Westin is a little piece of Paradise from the moment the tall-hatted doorman helps with your bags as you alight from the taxi. Lobby staff is attentive and eddicient.  My room on the back of the hotel, a few floors up, was spacious, comfortable and fresh-smelling. The view was an interesting one down a winding street..... The double-decker open-top bus stop is less than a total block, as is Starbucks.  The Westin is right within the heart of good food, good shopping and historic venues. I look forward to another visit here!",5,2016,06,10
202,Mint 500,Wonderful hotel with excellent staff. Very friendly and helpful. Bar is great and specialty drink are fantastic. Try the mint 500 and cosmopolitan daisy. Yum. Concierge had great recs and very centrally located. Trinity college close by,5,2016,06,09
202,Lovely hotel,"We recently stayed at this hotel on our way back from a long flight from America and wanted to stay the night in Dublin before our onward flight the next day.    The hotel was extremely comfortable - lovely bed linen, pillows and a superbly comfortable bed.     We had a deluxe room and both the bedroom and the bathroom were extremely clean.   The only thing I would say is I did ask for a city view room, but all we could see was a roof facing the window - no city view - in fact no view at all really.   But on this occasion it did not matter as we were very tired and just wanted a good rest.    

We ate in the bar downstairs and the staff and the atmosphere were great.   We will definitely stay at this hotel again.   Looking forward to our next stay already.",5,2016,06,06
202,Most welcoming Hotel.,"Situated right in the centre of Dublin within walking distance of Connolly train station, Bus station and all the main shopping areas. Night life is right on the door step if required. Room was well decorated and appointed as usual, to the front of hotel overlooking Westmorland Street but we were undisturbed by noise. The beds and bedding in the Westin are wonderful, the most comfortable you will find in any hotel. Staff are always very helpful especially the door staff on hand for information, directions, Taxis and the odd Umbrella!! Unfortunately our stay was just one night for a concert but we will return again and again as we have done to enjoy the calm relaxed atmosphere of the Westin.",5,2016,06,06
202,Nice hotel in the middle of it all,"I am a Westin fan, and was very excited to have the opportunity to stay at the Westin Dublin on my recent vacation.  We were greeted by Alan who helped us with our suitcases and valet.  He was so kind and took care of everything for us as we checked in.  Our room was a bit smaller than I expected, but the bathroom was legit!  Huge bathtub and separate shower.  We had a view of Trinity College on the 2nd floor.  We were unable to reduce the temperature in the room and it was a bit too hot for us at night when we slept.  The best part about this hotel is its location - we walked to every attraction from here, even the Guinness factory, which was about a 25 minute walk.  Grafton Street and Temple Bar are within 2 blocks - and we had a million restaurants, bars, and stores to choose from.  Unfortunately there was a lot of construction going on in front of the hotel when we stayed there and it was ugly and a bit cumbersome to deal with.  A local we spoke with said he thinks the construction will continue for another year or two!  We had drinks each night at the Mint bar and breakfast once at the Emerald restaurant.  The prices seemed high, but for the location and convenience, we were okay with it.  The concierge we spoke with a few times, Kenneth, was incredibly knowledgeable about the area, and gave us some great ideas for things to see and places to go.  We told him we booked a place for seafood one night for dinner and he said to cancel it and go to Matt The Thresher instead for seafood - and he didn't steer us wrong!  Such a great restaurant!",4,2016,06,03
202,Great Hotel,"This is a beautiful Westin located in a fabulous spot right downtown. We were able to walk to Trinity College, Temple Bar, and shop on Grafton Street with ease. The rooms and service are wonderful. We were upgraded as SPG members to the O'Connell Room and the four windows in the suite had wonderful views of Temple Bar and the O'Connell statue and the Spire of Dublin.",5,2016,06,02
202,Nice stay in Dublin,"This was an incredible location with unmatched service from the doorman to the check in counter.  The room was very spacious.  The doorman was extremely helpful with directions around the construction, which everything is in walking distance.  We were very pleased with our stay and location.",5,2016,06,02
202,Full Irish breakfasts at The Exchange were the best,"I stayed a total of 12 days at Westin. Comparing to many other Westin hotels I've stayed at in United States and other SPG properties in similar category, Westin Dublin stands out among others simply because of its people. Their reception (both day and night shifts), housekeeping, concierge, and even the doormen, are all extremely good at their job. Each time I had a question or needed something, they paid great attention to detail and made sure I was actually happy with what I was looking for. 

The best part of my mornings was the breakfast at Exchange restaurant, specially on the days when their hostess Eimear was working. She always remembered my breakfast order along with the special requests. 
There is another gentleman in a suit at The Exchange (can't remember his name) who is very professional, and remembers most of his guests' by their name. Their best skill is that when it gets really busy, they manage everything smoothly and flawlessly.  

Their fitness center is decent, hotel location is great (right by Trinity college), wifi is fast and Mint bar is nice. I do feel that they can work on the ambience of their lobby a little bit.

I stayed at another hotel for a couple days after checking out from Westin, and although it was good overall but there's no match for the staff at Westin Dublin.",5,2016,06,01
202,Stayed here twice,"Fantastic hotel and minutes from all the shops
We got a fab suite with a staircase going up to study
The mint bar is fab and have great cocktails but the menu is the same and could do with a change 
Will definitely be back",5,2016,05,31
202,Elegant little gem!!!,"We love Westin... this Westin was no exception.  In fact it was just a delight!! We got there after a long flight and stressful drive in.  (being tired and driving in Ireland for the first time does not make for a comfortable trip.) from the moment we arrived the doorman was a delight.  In full uniform he was so friendly and made us feel like we were indeed ""home"".  He took our car keys and luggage and sent us on our way to the front desk who was just as welcoming.  We were in one of the Writer suites and it was just beautiful with a sweet romantic terrace.  If you have never stayed at a Weston please understand they brag about their ""heavenly beds and baths"".  Should they you ask?  YES; every Westin has these amazing amenities and they truly are amazing.  The first day we did alot of sightseeing on one hour of asleep in 24. When we got back to our room we found our bed turned down... two new complimentary bottles of water... fresh towels from the ones we used before dinner.  Ice in an icebucket was waiting. Kenneth was the concierge who nailed every dinner suggestion right to our needs.  The hotel is just beautiful..the staff so helpful and the bar was also a delight.  Yes there is some construction going on..but this is not the fault of the hotel and did not bother us one bit.  We highly suggest this hotel.  Very boutique like.",5,2016,05,30
202,Very comfortable hotel,"Great location, loved the doormen, and the rooms were spacious and comfortable. The construction out front was a bit of a hassle especially while checking out. But, this was no fault of the hotel. Overall, a good stay.",4,2016,05,29
202,Location,"Our family had a great time !Central to everything !The staff were soo friendly and helpful 
My granddaughter loved the door man's outfit with his top hat and tails!
We had rooms on the same floor right next to each other!
 The temple bar area within a block !The Hop on hop of bus right there!
The bus from the airport stops on the corner ! Six euros .",5,2016,05,23
202,Very classy!,"Hotel
Was gorgeous and perfect
Location. We had the largest suite which was amazing with huge bathroom. Probably 10x12. My only complaint was the shower. It was barely 3x3 and crazy small. Lots of wasted space in this bathroom. Barely fit in shower!  Otherwise a perfect visit. ",5,2016,05,23
202,Great service,"We stayed in many Weatin hotels in different locations/countries.  I will say, this Westin by far is one of the top one.  Everyone from the doorman to the front desk, everyone are friendly.  The room is clean, the public areas are clean.  The only thing is they don't offer dinner except in the bar area.  However, since it is in the center of the town, there are a lot of options.",4,2016,05,22
202,Spring in Dublin,"The Westin exceeded my expectations in every way! Staff were friendly and helpful. The restaurant and bar were beautiful and food was great. The beds were heavenly! The most comfortable beds and linens!  The location is great for getting almost anywhere. We walked  or took the bus, that was only a block away.",5,2016,05,22
202,Conveinent Location,"I recently stayed at the Westin on a business trip. Admittedly I wasn't able to enjoy the sights of Dublin, but the hotel was right in the middle of many of my events and meetings so I could easily walk to most places. My room, 504 was very spacious and came with an added bonus of a terrace. The few days I was in town, the sun was out and I enjoyed sitting out there getting some fresh air and enjoying the rooftop filled view.

I only dined at the hotel restaurant once during my stay for breakfast. It was raining outside and I didn't want to venture out. The food was ok and as always, I forgot to ask for an espresso as they use instant coffee all over Ireland and if you want something that tastes good, you have to order a latte or espresso and add milk.

The Mint bar had a nice selection of cocktails and beers from around the world. I really enjoyed having a late night drink after a long day of meetings. Staff was friendly and cocktails were tasty.

Overall, I don't have any real negatives. Bed was comfortable and the room had a spacious closet and enormous bathroom. I would stay here again if my personal of business travels took me to Dublin.",4,2016,05,22
202,Pricey but fantastic,"Beautiful hotel right in the center of everything. The room was spacious, the bathroom was positively palatial. Staff was friendly. Just cross the street and the airport bus stop is right there. I didn't use the gym or visit the bar and restaurant - the decor was great from when I passed by.",5,2016,05,22
202,Afternoon Tea,"We enjoyed afternoon tea for a special occasion for a group of 4 friends. There is a choice of two types of afternoon tea and we all went for the traditional. I have to say the sweet treats were delicious. The savoury sandwiches could be much improved. 3 finger sandwiches one beef, one cucumber and one egg on plain bread not very exciting! When we arrived we wanted to order drinks but were handed four glasses of tap water. We had to ask for a drinks menu. My latte was served cold. We were given a top up of tea which was like pure water no tea. It was hard to get attention for ordering drinks etc. However, we did enjoy our experience but it was not the 5 star service we were expecting. ",3,2016,05,21
202,Hotel Stay,"Great property, perfect location to Grafton Street, Temple Bar, Trinity College.  Great rooms with very competent and attentive staff.  Valet parking, WY-Fi, Great bar called the Mint.  The hotel is located in the Old Irish Mint.  Just a few minutes from St. Stephen's Green.",5,2016,05,21
202,Stay Here,"Bite the bullet and pay the additional Euros to stay here.  Great hotel with a cool downstairs bar (love those turquoise chairs!!) and ultra convenient to everything to do in Dublin.  You will save on not having to take taxis and there is an ATM less than 1 block away.  An easy walk to the tour bus pick up point, temple bar area, the good local restaurant area and most of Dublin's sites.",5,2016,05,19
202,Always a top notch experience,"I have been fortunate to stay at this hotel four times in the last year. I am always blown away by the level of service offered by such a kind and professional group. They truly go out of their way to help and make you feel comfortable. The staff at this location are what hotel staffs over the world (especially the W Hotels!!!) should aspire to be.
Specifics:
-The rooms are always clean and well taken care of. They have great amenities to make your stay more pleasant like a good coffee/tea set up and a very good hairdryer (this is key to the female...and some male...travelers).
-The location is ideal. You are steps away from Trinity College and many tourist attractions like the Dublin Castle. If you are into fun nightlife, the Temple Bar area is just across the street and very lively and close enough for an easy *ahem* stumble back. The Westin also has a very lively bar downstairs if you prefer to celebrate closer to your room.
-Again, I must mention a fantastic staff!
-Great suites! From the spacious Grattan Suite to the 2 story Library suites, the hotel offers some unique and luxurious upgrade options.

Other reviewers have called out the high cost for this hotel and it is true, it is most certainly not the cheapest. But the truth is for the location, amenities and what you get for your money, it is not too far off (I travel to New York a lot so my hotel affordability meter may be skewed as a result :-/). I would highly recommend this hotel to any traveler, be it for business or for pleasure. It is worth the splurge for the level of service you receive.",5,2016,05,19
202,Nice Location & Friendly Staff,"We began our visit to Ireland by staying a couple of nights at the Westin Dublin.  The staff of the hotel was very friendly and gave excellent recommendations for places to visit during our stay.  The location of the hotel is close to dining, shopping and entertainment without having to use a cab.  Our room was comfortable and clean and the hotel bar has Guinness on tap.  It was a great place to start our Ireland adventure!",4,2016,05,18
202,Great service with a great location,"The hotel is located across the street from Trinity University and one block from Grafton Street and a very short walk to Temple Bar.  Everything is within walking distance except for Guinness and a cab will get you there.  The lobby is elegant yet welcoming with fires in the fireplace.  The rooms are elegant and very comfortable.  We did not eat at the hotel.  There is a Starbucks just around the corner where we had a great breakfast.  Be aware that there is considerable street construction going on at present.  You cannot hear the construction from the rooms (our room faced Trinity and some of the construction) but it makes getting a cab a little challenging.  That said, the doorman helps you and it becomes easy.  Would love to stay here again.",5,2016,05,18
202,Good but a bit overprized,"All good for a Westin, but it is missing the kick that many other hotels have in the vicinity.
Feels more like an average business hotel.
For that it is a bit overprized.
Positive: Room sizes are above average.",4,2016,05,18
202,"Smaller Rooms, but great location","Stayed here over a weekend between business trips.  The rooms were fairly small, but we though the location was excellent.  Right next door to Trinity College and walking distance to the river.  A bit of a walk (30 min) from the Guinness Storehouse, but you can do it mostly along the river.  We ate downstairs one time and thought the food was very good.",4,2016,05,18
202,One of the best afternoon teas in Dublin,Awesome hotel at the centre of Dublin city. The interior of the hotel is truly magnificent Easy access to transport links everywhere. The front of house were really friendly and gave us a lot of directions to lots of places. Fantastic afternoon tea!,5,2016,05,17
202,"Great location, great hotel","Everything was perfect at this lovely hotel from the comfy and attractive rooms to the full buffet breakfast. Our conference room was great, the AV worked and the catering was good. The hotel is very conveniently located close to trinity college.",5,2016,05,17
202,Amazing stay at fab hotel,Ideally located in heart of Dublin city centre. Luxurious stay in a fabulous hotel. Mint bar really relaxing. Rooms really spacious. Staff professional. Nespresso machine a great addition. Bathroom This man is Anthony luckwillas huge... Complete with bath and separate shower. Toiletries ... Gorgeous. Very quiet despite road works.,5,2016,05,17
202,Everything a luxury hotel should be,"I'm so happy to have a friend in the hotel business, because it means that every so often i get to see how very wealthy people live, and stay in a luxury hotel.  Such as the Westin Dublin.  It is everything that a luxury hotel should be: the rooms are beautiful, furnishings and textiles are high quality, bathrooms are spacious and made of marble, no amenity is spared.  Service is excellent, at the hotel and the eating establishments within it.  There and two restaurants and a bar, and all three boast fantastic service with beautiful and delicious food (i highly recommend the having the traditional tea at least once).  Moreover, the food is reasonably priced for such quality.  So are the in-room spa services.  Luxury hotels often charge exorbitant prices for these services simply because they can, but here they are priced the same as they would be at an upscale spa.  ",5,2016,05,16
202,Classy and Welcoming in a Perfect Location,"Our first 4 days in Ireland were spent at the Dublin Westin. Located across the street from Temple Bar, it was the perfect location. So many interesting places were within walking distance, and the city felt safe and exciting. Visits to the Dublin Castle, the Guinness Brewery, the literary pub crawl and the Jameson Distillery were an easy walk. The staff at the hotel was wonderful and the rooms were clean and elegant. Allan, the doorman, was particularly helpful. We will definitely return.",5,2016,05,15
202,Our time in Dublin!,"Our stay at the Westin Hotel was lovely!  The staff went out of their way to make us feel comfortable.  Service was impeccable!  We would certainly stay here again next time we are in Dublin. They helped us with restaurant reservations and transportation. The door man was wonderful. Being a Dubliner, he knew everything about the city.  The front desk staff even printed our boarding passes for us.  When it was time to leave to catch our flight early in the morning, the restaurant manager gave us free cups of coffee to go.
The very best service!",5,2016,05,15
202,Great food and excellent service in the Mint Bar,"Great night had in the Mint Bar. The menu was great, lots of selection and the food was delicious and very generous. The cocktails were amazing, and made to perfection. The staff were so nice and attentive. There was also a cool band in the bar which gave a brilliant atmosphere. We will definitely be back again.",5,2016,05,15
202,Terrific hotel,Had a great stay here. People were very friendly and helpful. The doorman was great and gave us a lot of valuable advice. Definitely worth a tip!  The Mint bar is worth having a drink at and the breakfast buffet is one of the best I have had.,5,2016,05,13
202,Vacations are hard work.  You need a beautiful place to stay.,"I stayed in the Westin Dublin from 4/17 to 4/22, to join friends, one of whom was working.  My friends stayed at the Marker.  I won.  

I drank my coffee while it was still dark, looking out my window over Trinity College, where lights began to wink on before there was any traffic.  It was magical.

Beds are scrumptious, bottled water so appreciated, as was coffee/tea maker.  My bathroom was wonderful. The concierge was spot on with recommendations.  We did not have a bad meal anywhere.  The Atrium is a delight when feet are worn down and tea is required, my friends joined me at MY hotel.  Jenny (does Jenny ever go home?) was always there to help with any questions or arrangements.  There's another board meeting next April, and I may tag along again.  Delightful city.  More to see.",5,2016,05,12
202,Weekend away in great location ,"Stayed here for 2 nights for our anniversary. We had a warm welcome and the staff were all very helpful for our entire stay. We had mentioned it was our anniversary when we booked and had a nice touch of bottle of red wine and some chocolate cake waiting for us. Couldn't ask for a better location in Dublin, couple of minutes from the lively Temple Bar area, just other side of the river from O'Connel street. Breakfast was very good and plenty of choice. Will stay again when we are back.",4,2016,05,08
202,Excellent,"We attended a family wedding here on the May bank holiday saturday.  What an amazing venue. From the setting, right in the heart of Dublin in an amazing building to the attentive, extremely well trained staff, the outstanding food and the superb atmosphere, even if you were to just drop in for a drink in the bar, it would be worth it to see this beautiful hotel.",5,2016,05,08
202,Great staff but rooms overrated,"Superb location in the busy city centre, easy to find and great doormen/valets. Unfortunately with the construction out front it's a bit chaotic right now.

Excellent knowledgeable and friendly staff. Room was very comfortable but cozy; I have stayed here before and remembered my room being more spacious. My experience this time reminded me of a cramped NYC Times Square hotel room.

Room can be noisy with the window open but keeps the sound in very well once closed. The blackout curtains, however, don't live up to their name, as the room was fairly bright.

We slept in and missed breakfast (a testament to their comfy beds). If the price is right I'd consider staying here again, but given the current construction situation it wouldn't be unreasonable to consider other options.",4,2016,05,07
202,Look elsewhere.......,....... if you are looking for a good hotel with some service!  The service levels at this hotel is the worst I have seen of any starwood property worldwide with absolute no recognition of platinum or frequent travel status.  Perhaps the issue stems from the top as the GM of the hotel does not really care about the customers choosing to stay at this property.  There are definitely better choices at this price in Dublin.,1,2016,05,06
202,Could this be the Perfect Westin?,"I have a love/hate relationship with Westin.  The company has so many excellent facilities in fantastic locations, but more times than not, the experience implodes with the service or the way you are treated.  I'm pleased to say that this is not the case at the Westin Dublin.  

You will not find a better location in Dublin as you are within steps of so many attractions; Temple Bar, Trinity College, River Liffey, Grafton Street, good restaurants, etc.  The public areas are beautiful and our Writer's Room was very well decorated and well appointed, but best of all, where it usually falls apart for us, there was free wifi (finally at a Westin) and everyone from housekeeping, room service, reception, the doorman to The Exchange staff were pleasant and accommodating.  A special shout out goes to the hostess at breakfast, she was exceptionally pleasant to deal with.  If we saw a flaw it was that the concierge were not necessarily as knowledgeable about local attractions as I would have expected them to be.",5,2016,05,05
202,"Great Hotel, Great  Location","Just got back from vacation trip to Scotland and Ireland and one of the best hotels I stayed at for several days was the Westin in Dublin. If you want to treat yourself to a stay at an excellent 5 star hotel in Dublin, this should be your first choice. It has several outstanding features. 

First, the rooms are large.  Ours easily fit a queen sized bed, writing desk and sofa chair. The bathroom had a good size shower/tub and sink and towels were large and soft.  Room was very clean. Second, the location is awesome and a great central point for Dublin Center, it‚Äôs right across the street from Trinity College, Grafton Street shopping, bars on Fleet and Temple Bar Street, bus stops and Starbucks, etc. Third, the staff including reception, concierge and door bellman was very helpful with directions, questions and suggestions. Fourth, the building and its furnishings can easily be described as gorgeous.  And, there is a great bar in the basement called the Mint Bar- it""s the perfect place to finish the day with an Irish coffee.  And Fifth, the Exchange Restaurant had an excellent breakfast with many choices of cold and hot food.  

Overall, we had an excellent experience and would not hesitate to stay again.",5,2016,05,05
202,Top hotel in city centre,"Located less than five minutes walk from the city centre, this comfortable small hotel is ideal for a weekend break. Friendly front-desk staff welcome you and efficiently check you into a comfortable contemporary bedroom. The Irish breakfast is excellent, served in the recently refurbished art deco Exchange restaurant. We really enjoyed our stay.",5,2016,05,05
202,Is it a Westin?,"This is surprising. Hotel is a great location and the rooms are okay, but it really undermines itself. No wonder it's near empty. 

Room can be described as spartan. Big room but only a few pieces of furniture. Feels even more glum with only one tiny window. 

Bathroom is big but dated. No amenities. Minibar is the penny pinching type that charges you automatically when you even bump an item - haven't seen one of these mean spirited things for years. The green option means no-one even replenishes water or removes the garbage.  TV automatically switches off after 20 mins. 

Doesn't feel like a Westin. 

Oh, and the food is so disappointing. Yesterday had a Caesar salad. Okay, but so mean spirited with the smoked chicken - less than half a handful.  Then tonight, had the steamed see bass. At ‚Ç¨25 really expected a piece of fish much bigger than my room key card. Rice was dry and not fresh.
The food here is bland and I'll be eating out for the rest of the week. Even the staff were embarrassed - good display of empathy but awful for them to be delivering this garbage. Two nights in a row I'll be crossing the road for a burger after dinner here... 

What can I say? Gym is quiet. ",2,2016,05,04
202,Great Dublin Experience,"Beautiful hotel, free wifi, central location, excellent staff. Rooms was comfortable but we had a room on the 5th floor and the ceiling felt lower up there. The bathroom also seemed built out of very thin drywall so you could hear everything inside the bathroom which is always strange. We stayed for two nights and enjoyed our time there. Truthfully Westins tend to be our nice, go-to hotel, and this did not disappoint, although because it is a large chain there is nothing particularly quaint or inspiring about it. A good and safe bet for a place to stay in a large city.",4,2016,05,02
202,Amazing stay!!!!,"From start to finish everything about our stay was fantastic. The staff couldn't do more for us, everyone from the duty manager to the cleaning staff were pleasant and helpful. Breakfast selection is second to none and all fresh. Cannot praise high enough the staff of the Westin Dublin.",5,2016,04,28
202,"Disappointed, and let down..","This had been a favourite hotel of mine. 1st time back for approx 2 years, and the hotel and service has deteriorated significantly.  On arrival was informed that this was my 17th visit by a rather surly receptionist - Not a friendly welcome.  I'm SPG Gold, and this was a points redemption - but was given a clearly old room - no upgrade, but not even a nice room - the program then just  isn't worth it, especially not with so much competition. Issues with the room : black mouldy bathroom grouting, very noisy extractor fan, and one bedroom light not working.  Room 529 - avoid. Room service breakfast arrived 2 hours (!!!!) early at 6.30am, and the waiter insisted it was my mistake - which it wasn't. Later on checking out, the cost was waived as they did agree it was their mistake, but in the moment the service was lousy, and we got 2 hours less sleep. Thanks,Finally, we asked for gym shoes  - it took 3 attempts for the right size to be finally delivered....Overall, a poor experience and little recognition to a very loyal customer. Next time, a different high end hotel in Dublin for us.",3,2016,04,26
202,An AMAZING Hotel!,"I have been to several Westin properties but all pale in comparison to the Westin Dublin. The hotel is gorgeous and the staff is warm and welcoming. Our room was on the first floor (which is really the 3rd or 4th floor) overlooking the Temple Bar area and we didn't have a single noise issue. It was perfect for getting a great nights sleep. And, the location of the hotel is also amazing. Everything is within walking distance. Book of Kells, the Liffey, all the bars and restaurants you could want. I was really happy with our stay. Thanks to the team at Westin Dublin for making our trip so special!",5,2016,04,26
202,Great hotel amazing service,"This was an excellent pleasant experience. .. ..the staff were all rock stars and all amazing from check in (a wonderful woman with slight accent was friendly to us especially my wife and mother in law and I can't remember her name) to concierge (especially Laszlo)!. We have traveled quite a bit and Laszlo dazzled us with his exemplary service. . .. not only did he painstakingly look up some pertinent info regarding an obscure poet's grave info (my mother-in-laws fav Irish poet) but he gave us amazing food recs and we like him are foodies! He was superb but the whole staff shined! 

We were upgraded to nice room/suite  (as we are SPG platinum) and had the wonderful breakfast as our SPG platinum Welcome amenity. We loved our room and of course the wonderful heavenly Westin beds ensured we slept wonderfully!

Amenities: I believe there is a gym however we were too busy exploring enchanting Dublin to utilize their gym facilities. There are three dining options (the atrium lounge with enticing tranquil  natural light streaming in, the exchange where we had breakfast and the Mint bar). The Exchange Restaurant is in a superb Art Deco space with large windows facing Westmoreland Street which not only provides you with superb natural light but gives you ample opportunity to people watch!) The breakfast was superb with a nice range of healthy options from yogurts, fruits etc to oatmeal to of course the usual cardiac catheterizing favorites such as bacon and other full Irish breakfast treats.

The Mint bar was a mixologist dream as it is an amazing space (bank vault i believe as this building in prior life was a bank) with amazing drinks and service. there also was live music one weekend night so great place to enjoy music and drinks!

Location: centrally located across from Trinity College!

cons: the only con and it's not hotels fault there is ongoing constriction on Westmoreland street i believe for extension or work on metro. In addition as its on Westmoreland street and central location there is heavy traffic on Friday and rush hour (Dublin is walkable so don't take car during these hours!)

We highly recommend this wonderful hotel with no reservations !!

202,Great time ine Dublin !,"We arrived at the end of our two week trip to Ireland. It was the fitting perfect end to a wonderful time in Ireland.  All the staff could not go more out of their way to make us comfortable and to feel right at home.  From the front desk, Mo with our luggage and Al at the door, were all warm and full of information to make our time memorable.",5,2016,04,25
202,"Excellent location, friendly staff","Stayed here for a long weekend with our family of 5.  The location is hard to beat.  It is right across the street from Temple Bar, with many great attractions to see.  The hotel staff were extremely friendly and went out of their way to make us comfortable.  We had 2 adjoining rooms that were spacious and clean.  Stephen at the door also knew our children by name the 2nd time we saw him and the kids looked forward to seeing him each time we left the property.  The only negative is the above-ground tram that is under construction directly in front of the hotel.  This makes things slightly more difficult, but turned out to be more of an eyesore than a real inconvenience.  You really can't beat this location.  Take a walk across the street to Trinity College, then grab a bite at one of the many pubs in the area.  Although it was moderately difficult to find a pub that could accommodate 3 small children (in fact there were 2 restaurants that explicitly did NOT allow children... and it was 5:30p).  We got lucky and found a table at the Elephant and Castle in Temple Bar.   They were VERY pleasant, and the food was better than expected.  The Ark children's museum is a great place to spend an hour with the kids, right in Temple Bar.  Also worth the cab ride is the Guinness brewery tour.  The self guided tour is very well done, and our small children were also entertained.  The bar at the top overlooking Dublin is a great spot to rest and enjoy some quality product.",5,2016,04,24
202,Great Hotel in Dublin,"The Westin in Dublin is wonderful.  Very clean and friendly with a tremendous staff.  We spent a full week there, could not ask for a better location within Dublin, almost everything is within a walking distance and we had the Westin facilities when we needed a break.  Anne Marie at the front desk really helped us get settled into a room even though we arrived before 8am.  The entire concierge staff was tremendous and helped us get all around the city. Mo went out of his way to help us with our room and to give us ideas on places to visit.  Kenneth was always a welcome face and gave us great tips about Dublin.  Laszlo seemed able to arrange for anything we needed.  Thanks to all for helping make our visit special.",5,2016,04,21
202,Good Location & Excellant Service,"i stayed at the Westin Dublin recently as part of a small group.  Our room was up to date, very clean and overlooked the street.  The bathrooms was HUGE-so if you are a fan of luxury bathrooms (not common in Ireland!) than this is a good choice for you.  As usual, the bed was indeed heavenly.  The service was top notch and the location was perfect.",5,2016,04,20
202,Comfiest beds,"Stayed here with a friend for 2 nights. Room service food was surprisingly good and beds are amazingly comfortable. Really didn't like that when we decided to stay in bed for a while the next morning that the cleaning staff knocked on our door at least 5 times in 10 minutes. The 1st time was our fault - we forgot the ""Do not disturb"" sign. Resulted in both of us being hugely irritated. Also over charged for entertainment, although this was sorted at reception. Perfect location",4,2016,04,19
202,Nice and very clean,"The hotel is very nice and very clean. The stuff is very helpful and polite. My room was big with all comforts. The bathroom huge with shower and bath. 
The hotel is located in a very nice area, where there are many pubs and restaurants. The main conference room has an artistic and very beautiful ceiling.",4,2016,04,17
202,Amazing hotel!,"I absolutely loved our five night stay here.  The staff was very accommodating, allowing us to check in very early after a long flight over the Atlantic.  The room itself was beautiful, with a comfortable bed and a great view of Trinity College.  Finally, the location is absolutely ideal for Temple Bar, sightseeing, and visiting the Long Stone pub, which is my favorite!",5,2016,04,13
202,"Very charming, great location, but people next door sound like they're in your room with you...","I really enjoyed my stay at the Westin Dublin.  To start, the location is fantastic, right next to Trinity College and the Temple Bar area.  The rooms were quite large, and the building lends a historic atmosphere to start off your Ireland trip.  The Heavenly bed, as always, was amazing.  The reception staff and concierge were also very welcoming.

In terms of flaws, first, Internet.  Huge miss for a hotel of this caliber to have such slow Internet.  This needs to be urgently upgraded.  Second, thin walls.  We had a couple in the next room, and it genuinely felt like they were sitting in our room with us.  I could even make out conversation, such that I started whispering because I'm sure they could hear us as well.

Overall, this was a lovely stay, and I'd definitely book here again.",4,2016,04,13
202,Great Stay at the Westin Dublin,"We recently stayed (9 nights) at the Westin.  We had a Deluxe King room.  The bed (Westin Heavenly Bed) was so comfortable, my wife wants to find one for the house...  the entire staff was always professional/courteous.   The concierges were very helpful in recommending/arranging activities, restaurants, transportation.",5,2016,04,13
202,Great location and service. Rooms are OK.,"Perfect location, on the south side of central Dublin, just across the street from Trinity College.
Service is perfect. Very attentive staff. 
Breakfast is awesome in its own dedicated space: The Exchange.
It is a beautiful building with its own well furnished, beautiful common areas.
Room is OK. Well kept and all. Small but comfortable.
It is a great choice in downtown Dublin.",4,2016,04,13
202,Lovely room,"There is construction right out front, so it's difficult to know where to find valet. They delivered our bags to the room before we even received our keys which was lovely. The room was nice and quiet as well. We requested an atrium view and didn't receive it; however, it would've been a hassle to move all of our things to a new room. Luckily noise wasn't a problem. We visited the Mint Bar twice and service was rather slow but the food and drinks were fantastic. The Concierge was very helpful with directions. Overall a comfortable stay but not as impressive as other Westin hotels with service.",3,2016,04,12
202,Ideal Service and location,"The staff at the Westin went out of their way to make us feel welcome. We rented a car via the hotel - could not have been easier or more convenient.  Our room was lovely, clean and stylish. Walk anywhere and everywhere.",5,2016,04,11
202,AFTERNOON TEA,"MY FAMILY AND I (5) HAD AFTERNOON TEA IN THE ATRIUM 8/5/2016. 
TO SAY IT WAS WONDERFUL IS AN UNDERSTATEMENT. WE HAVE HAD AFTERNOON TEA (AT) IN MANY PLACES INCLUDING THE RITZ IN PARIS AND THIS SURPASSED THEM ALL. 

THE YOUNG WOMAN WHO SERVED US WAS PLEASANT, ATTENTIVE AND VERY HELPFUL AND EVEN ACKNOWLEDGED THE OCCASION WE WERE CELEBRATING WITH AN EXTRA SLICE OF GATEAUX.

THERE ARE TWO AFTERNOON TEA OPTIONS, THE TRADITIONAL AT (VERY GOOD) AND THE MOST PECULIAR  AT. WE HAD BOTH, 

THE MOST PECULIAR IS AMAZING AND COMES WITH: 
A pot of Victorian Mojito Hendrick‚Äôs gin, mint, lime and
freshly pressed churned apple juice 
Confit of pork cheek, stilton and honey aioli
Prawn cocktail filled charcoal cone
Spiced roast beef, spinach, red onion and horseradish involtine
Oak smoked Irish salmon, caviar, cream cheese blini
Black olive, tomato tapenade and goats cheese dipper
V
Banana and walnut bread, cinnamon and honey butter
V
Amaretti, white chocolate and lemon crunch
Popping vanilla marshmallows
Almond and redcurrant frangipane tart
Popcorn panna cotta, toffee popcorn crumble
Chocolate and caramel seasalt brownie.

 WE HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS EXPERIENCE.",5,2016,04,09
202,Nice City Hotel in Dublin,"The Westin is very good located. You are in walking distance to nearly everything: shopping streets, museums, Dublin castle, Temple bar, restaurants. Service is very professional. Rooms are large and clean. They have a cosy bar in the basement. ",4,2016,04,09
202,Fabulous Hotel,"This is one of my favourite hotels in Dublin. The staff are really friendly, the location is extremely central and the atmosphere is very luxurious. I recommend visiting the Mint Bar for cocktails and/or the Atrium for the best afternoon tea in Dublin!",4,2016,04,08
202,"Great hotel, with style & a few quirks","Central Dublin isn't easy to get in and out of at the moment; I something think there's a competition on how many roadworks can be on the go at once. 

Happily, the Westin is basically exactly where you want to be; it's fantastically located and - even though Dublin is a small city - most of the things you will want to see are well within walking distance. 

The hotel itself is clean & stylish with good facilities. Staff were very helpful; and I liked a few of the quirks in the rooms such as the sunken wardrobes & picture choices.

I visited on business this time; but I am very tempted to book here if I succeed in dragging the family across to Dublin. Well worth a stay.",4,2016,04,08
202,They will make you happy!,"Arrived to some problems with my suite.  At first, I was told I was upgraded, but it was actually a downgrade.  After insisting upon the category I booked, they bought me a drink and got it ready.  The hotel has been recently renovated. There are some kinks to be worked out.  I noted these to the Manager on Duty who was incredibly accommodating and made sure I was happy. Also checking on me was the ""Experience Manager"" for SPG Platinum guests.  

Likes:
*Breakfast Buffet being open until 11am on weekends (I wish it was open until 11am everyday since jet lag was a huge issue for me).  
*""The Mint"" bar downstairs bar is well stocked with creative and rare spirits including my favorite Monkey 47 gin, and staff who know how to ""smoke"" a drink and make a Sazarac.
The Fish and Chips at this bar are excellent!!!! (sole instead of cod)
*Turndown Service and amenities
*Knowledgeable Concierge about local dining
*Housekeeping staff are detailed
*Engineering is responsive
*Location is adjacent to Trinity College, Shopping District, and Temple Bar areas
*Very helpful and friendly staff!!!!
*Human ""wake-up"" calls, not a robot.

Dislikes:
*There is very limited drawer space in the rooms.  They are designed for living out of your suitcase or a two night stay maximum.
*Concierge Desk is not consistently staffed.
*Internet service seemed slow and spotty
*Limited channel selections on Television and limited Pay Movie selections",5,2016,04,07
202,"Nice rooms, helpful staff","Rooms are spacious and well decorated, staff are very helpful and the hotel is in an excellent central location. Only downside was that roadworks outside the hotel meant that unfortunately my room was noisy overnight - would recommend avoiding rooms overlooking the street outside the hotel for this reason.",4,2016,04,06
202,Our New Home in Dublin,"The short review: Stay at The Westin Dublin; you won't be disappointed!

I've been traveling to Dublin every year for the past five years so after having had such an AMAZING stay at the Westin Dublin, I had to ask myself, ""Why hadn't I stayed at the Westin Dublin before?""  1. I usually avoid large 5-star chain hotels and prefer hotels with some local character; however this Starwood Hotel is housed in a historic building; meticulously renovated with warmth, elegance and charm. 2. I was concerned that crossing busy Westmoreland Street would be a problem for exploring the nearby area. No worries; there is a pedestrian crossing a few steps away from the Hotel so that nearby tourist attractions, restaurants and pubs are easily accessible on foot. 

What finally made me ‚Äúwake up‚Äù was a  ‚Äúregrettable‚Äù experience that I'd had this year with a hotel that we'd been loyal to for the past five years! (Please refer to my latest review of  The Temple Bar Hotel). The five star Westin Dublin charged HALF the price of  the ‚Äúother place‚Äù and more importantly provided the best night's sleep, accommodation, amenities, service we'd ever had in Dublin! Everyone from our initial contact with the doorman to our check out at the front desk, was welcoming, professional and efficient, and couldn't have done enough for us. The Westin bedding is legendary, the room temperature is adjustable, storage space and good lighting abound, housekeeping standards are superlative; all which guarantee a good night's sleep. Within five minutes upon our morning arrival, we were checked in to a perfect room overlooking Trinity College,with all arrangements made for the following morning - wake up call, breakfast, and flat-rate taxi transfer to the airport. As a result we were able to fully enjoy our last day in Dublin.

The Westin Dublin has a grand breakfast buffet (although I must agree with a previous review that the scrambled eggs are a bit heavy) that is FULL of delightful offerings and some ‚Äúhealthy‚Äù choices as well. The Westin Dublin caters to guests who want to maintain their healthy lifestyle while traveling and as a runner, I appreciate their health-conscious additions to the menu, gymnasium, and athletic attire loaning program. Beautiful Stephens Green is easily accessible from the Hotel via pedestrian - shopping Grafton Street and is a perfect place to enjoy a walk or run. 

The Westin Dublin's location is excellent. Trinity College (The Book of Kells and Library), the Andrew & Suffolk Street Tourism Office (a day tour meeting place), and a brand new Irish Whiskey Museum are within a few minutes walk of the Hotel. There are also some tourist ""hot spots"" like Gogarty's and the Temple Bar area, as well as traditional places like the Ha'Penny Bridge, Gallagher's Boxty House and The Palace Bar nearby. Whether on foot or relying on public transportation, the Westin Dublin provides an excellent vantage point from which to travel all over Dublin. The DART, LUAS, public buses, and Hop-on tourist buses are all nearby. Taxis arrive at the Hotel with lightening speed.  Construction for the new LUAS line is on-going, but it never adversely affected us. (You can always ask for an inner-courtyard room if you're concerned.) Thank you Westin Dublin.....our new home in Dublin!",5,2016,04,06
202,Convenient Location,"Our family stayed here the week of St. Patrick's Day.  Since the hotel is along the parade route, it was easy to secure a front row spot right outside the hotel for the parade.  Although the hotel is on a busy corner, the location was perfect for our first time in Dublin.  It's very close to Grafton Street and Temple Bar which made it convenient for shopping and restaurants.  Since our room was on the alley side, we did get some noise from St. Patrick's Day revelers at night but expected it anyway.  The staff at the front desk and concierge were nice and helpful.  The rooms (we needed two for 5 people) were clean and comfortable.  We enjoyed having afternoon tea at the Atrium Lounge although one of the servers seemed a little bit overwhelmed.  We enjoyed our stay and would stay here again.",4,2016,04,06
202,5 Star Hot Chocolate ,"Visited the Atrium for 5Star Hot Chocolate, Coffee and some sweet treats. Great service and real value. What a fantastic room in Floor 1. Lovely ambience, intimate yet homely. Lovely comfy chairs. Certainly worth a detour in a central location.",5,2016,04,05
202,Night out in the city,"Plus points - Fantastic location, beautiful decor & friendly staff.
Negative points - road works outside the hotel leave it very difficult to drive to and work starts early each morning.  The Bar was extremely quiet at night, and closed up early even for residents.  We were informed that there was no residents bar, but if you wanted a late drink you had to order from your room!
Overall the hotel is beautiful, but has a serious lack of atmosphere.",4,2016,04,05
202,Lovely Luxury Hotel!,"I've stayed here a couple of times now with the last experience being the best. It's a fantastic hotel, perfect location in my opinion, a few minutes from Temple Bar and ten minutes from the city centre. The beds are amazing to sleep in as with all Westin hotels. 

The best thing about this hotel is the Mint Lounge bar. It's an old bank so the main bar is in the old vault. I adore this bar and frequented it many times during my visit. They have live music at weekends, jazz usually which always sounds good. This time they had a band which was fronted by a lady, she couldn't sing very well and was drowned out by the band but still enjoyable. 

My only complaint was that the hot water went off during our stay so I couldn't have a shower at one point. I called to reception advising them and they said there was an issue that they were trying to rectify. I understood but as I hung up the phone the door knocked and a member of staff asked if I needed any ice or an ice bucket! Purely coincidental I'm sure so it made me smile rather than frown!

Also make sure you tell reception to clear your room of any drinks you have had from the bar or coffee/tea machines as they will leave the half finished drinks in your room when the maids service during the day.

Overall a 4 star rating due to the water issue.",4,2016,04,04
202,Great points redemption value,"We had an excellent experience there using our points for a free stay. They were very accommodating and helpful- especially the front desk and housekeeping. The rooms were immaculate, and the handicapped room was huge and beautiful. We were also upgraded to a Writer's Room, which came with a small balcony with a lovely view up Fleet Street. The Beds were supremely comfortable, and the bathrooms were huge.
My only nit is that the buffet breakfast wasn't as good as I would've expected. The eggs were odd- perhaps powdered? Or undercooked? Sometimes with a little green tint? Still, that's a minor quibble for an overall superlative stay.",5,2016,04,03
202,Great location!,"The Westin Dublin has a great location for a visit in Dublin.
It's just next to the Trinity Collage and a stone's throw away from the Temple Bar and the town centre.

We had a room facing the courtyard, which was nice. It wasn't too loud. The size was okay, but it wasn't a huge room.

The staff was really nice!",4,2016,04,01
202,Excellent home base for Dublin,"Staying here currently for the second time on our trip. Such a pleasant stay and Starwood hardly ever goes wrong. On our first day we explored Trinity college which is directly next door, early lunched at the Kilkenny cafe, dinner at the Pig's Ear and journeyed on the hop on/hop off bus. Staff is very helpful. Tonight we walked through Temple Bar and prepare for an early departure. Would absolutely stay here again. ",5,2016,03,30
202,Exceptional hotel & service,"As a rule, we like to stay at Westin. Always treated very well by staff, Westin Dublin is no different. 

Upon arrival, the doorman helped us with our luggage. We were greeted promptly by the front desk associate and checked in within a few moments. She explained breakfast and what activities that were going on during our stay. 

The concierge helped with dinner arrangements. It was a holiday and many restaurants were closed. They were always a available. Thanks for the great customer service. 

The accommodations were top notch. The hotel decor is very traditional. I love the interior. The bed was so comfortable. Almost like being at home. We slept so well. We had a roll away bed and it was just as comfortable. 

The hotel is within walking distance of restaurants and pubs. Literally around the corner. Family oriented for dinners or hitting the pub. 

We would definitely stay here again. ",5,2016,03,29
202,The Tops,Stayed first two nights of the year. This was a great place and was centrally located. Wedged between the river and Trinity College it is a short walk to the Temple Bar district in one direction and a straight walk down to the Post Office in the other. The staff could not do enough for us and the beds were luxurious.  There are tourist bus stops adjacent to the premises that cover the whole city. I would easily stay here again. ,4,2016,03,29
202,Worth every penny,"This is one of my favorite hotels in Dublin.
Its location is fantastic and central to pretty much anywhere you need to get to .
The rooms are large with separate dressing area . When on a higher level it isnt as noisy as other hotels in Dublin. We had a magnificent view of the centre of the hotel as the window looks down on to the lounge and bar area .
When there we wen t o see a concert in the Three arena and it was very accessible. Even in Friday traffic it only cost 11 euro to get there.
While in Dublin we got the tour bus which is only a 5 minute walk up to O Connell street and it was well worth the tour.The food in the hotel was lovely breakfast was nice also. 
The works on the road outside the hotel are the only nuisance. All and all had a great stay and will be back.",5,2016,03,29
202,"Good hotel, not so good stay","This hotel checks off a lot of right boxes:

1. Very central location, to give you an idea the St.Patrick parade passes right by the front door and everything is close.
2. Great breakfast
3. Clean rooms

Frankly I was a bit unhappy about my stay, mostly due to the fact there was a road construction under my window (and they did it at night), so I didn't get good sleep and it also took me a few tries before my bill came out right, but hopefully I had a one off case and it's not going to impact you.",5,2016,03,26
202,Excellent Location - top rate staff - and comfortable rooms,"The bed was amongst the best I have encountered in my travels.  The room was spacious and quiet.  It is an elegant hotel - with understated luxury to make the most weary traveler comfortable.

All of the staff I encountered (front desk, doorman, concierge) were wonderful.

It is a great location - close to Trinity college, Temple Bar, O'Connell Street - with good public transportation.",5,2016,03,25
202,This is a nice old hotel in the heart of old Dublin.,"An easy stroll to Trinity College, Temple Bar, the river Liffey, the Westin is well situated in Dublin.

The breakfasts are excellent, the staff are informative and helpful and the rooms are spacious and clean.

We were at the back, next to the gymnasium, not a great site, specify away from the gym to avoid listening to early morning grunting and banging, yes it was just the weights routine!",4,2016,03,24
202,Elegance,"This elegant hotel is very warm inviting with fireplaces in the lobby. It is located in the heart of Dublin.  Walking distance to the Dart train, shopping, restaurants and pubs. 
The staff is very nice and willing to help with any questions you might have.",5,2016,03,23
202,Room Overlooking Atrium,I stayed in this hotel five years ago and thought it was great but its gone down hill quite a bit since then. Perhaps because of the room which was inward facing and overlooking the Atrium - made me feel a bit claustrophobic. Didn't get any extra benefit at all from being an SPG Gold Card member.,2,2016,03,23
202,Good breakfast,"Recently stayed one night here for work. Room was nice, queen bed, bathroom very comfortable. 
Had the breakfast - excellent scrambled eggs.
Service was very good, I will certainly be back as the location is very central and it is great for work or pleasure.",5,2016,03,23
202,Weekend leisure break,"Excellent location. Just a short stroll to all the attractions. Door staff were very helpful and efficient. Likewise with the reception staff. Our room was warm and clean with all the amenities you could wish for. We had lunch on arrival in the Atrium bar which is a lovely bright and airy space. We gave the Mint bar a miss as is was a little dark and not to our taste. Breakfast was served in the main dining room which is adjacent to the front entrance. Excellent breakfast menu, I had the full Irish and can thoroughly recommend it. All in all we really enjoyed our short stay and would stay here again",5,2016,03,21
202,Afternoon Tea at The Westin,"A wonderful Mothers Day treat. We were met by a charming, friendly young lady and brought to our table which was just off The Atrium. The surroundings were beautiful and very conducive to our desire to share a Mother/Daughter time out. Service was initially slow but food was wonderful, tea/coffee refills were plentiful and again the staff were marvellous. Discreet but friendly. We sat for hours just chatting and reminiscing feeling under no pressure to leave. In fact at one point we mentioned to group of ladies who were also enjoying their afternoon the difference feeling unhurried made and we all agreed this was a truly lovely touch. Price was also quite reasonable.
Only downside - a very little one - was that our 2nd glass of Prosecco was charged at full price (‚Ç¨1.50 each more expensive). Pity.",5,2016,03,21
202,Nice rooms but very disappointed with the service in the Mint Bar,"I was here for the weekend with friends. I travel a lot on business  but this review is based on a leisure stay.

The hotel overall was very good, but severely let down by the residents bar.

Rooms - lovely
Reception & reception staff - great
Restaurant (breakfast) - good
Door staff - very good
Mint Bar - very poor.

1st time in a hotel where 80% of the residents bar seats and tables were reserved and no one was using them. We were told a number of groups were due in and we couldnt use the tables or chairs. Im the end we has to sit by the toilets. It took us 15 mins to get a drink despite the bar being quiet and several staff working. Time of arrival 7.30pm.",2,2016,03,20
202,"Beautiful hotel, best location. ","Pros: I have stayed a few other places in Dublin, but the Westin definitely has the best location. It's close to all of the main streets and bars, but in a quieter spot. Also, I requested an early check in a few weeks before my arrival, and they let me into my room at 11am. The reception was very accommodating. Overall beautiful hotel. 

Cons: My room, 407, did not have many windows, only a sky light, and a window without a view of the city, so there wasn't very much natural light. ",5,2016,03,20
202,Close to everything you need while touring Dublin,"Located a block or 2 from Temple Barr, Trinity college, and St. Patrick's Cathedral, this hotel has perfect location for those visiting Dublin.

Rooms were clean and modern. The breakfast buffet wasn't flashy but solid to start your day's venture. Staff was courteous.

Being a downtown hotel, views dont really matter. Stay toward the courtyard for a slight reduction in street noise. The noise wont matter most likely because if you're there, you're going to take advantage of the exciting night life.",4,2016,03,18
202,Weekend Visit enjoyable and relaxing,Arrived on Thursday for a long weekend - very nice hotel and very helpful staff. Room service (make up) had to be reminded but overall very comfortable and clean. Had a small suite with balcony very nice. The welcome cheese and fruit was a nice touch. Hotel rooms need updating but very well maintained. Location is very central and convenient to Tram (Luas) and walking distance to everything. Airport is about 30min by taxi or buses across street. The Mint Bar was enjoyable for dinner even if place was quiet.,4,2016,03,15
202,Great Stay,"The location is great. Close to Temple Bar where there is always live music somewhere! 
Shopping, restaurants. The staff were happy, very helpful and accommodating. The room was clean and quiet.   I would definitely go back and stay here!",5,2016,03,12
202,"Westin Hotel - noisy construction at all hours, faulty wifi","I have stayed in many Westin Hotels in different parts of the world, and although the location of this hotel was convenient and the customer service when I checked in was great, I was bothered by the fact that there was construction going on right outside my window past 12:30am. I called down to the front desk and asked what was going on and when the construction and noise was going to end, and the receptionist told me that they didn't know and it was out of their control, but they would be glad to move me to another room. As much as I appreciate the offer, I wish they would have thought of the construction noise beforehand and at least notified me (and other guests) about it, in order to give us an option as to what part of the hotel we would prefer to stay in. Offering to change my room after midnight is not only inconsiderate, it's downright insulting to a guest. I was already unpacked and too tired to even consider changing rooms. I understand that the Westin staff had no control over the hours of construction on the street, but they could have been more forthcoming with the information, considering it had been on-going for weeks (a receptionist informed me of this upon check-out). Also, regarding the wifi, most hotels have you accept their terms and conditions for using the wifi, but the Westin wanted me to log in with my email, which made no sense at all, and then it kept logging me off. Extremely frustrating and agitating to say the least. Other than that, it was a very clean hotel with spacious rooms and nice amenities.",4,2016,03,11
202,Good all round,"Overnight stay for an aviation gathering bed really comfy, free water and ironing equipment plus a tv that isn't difficult to work out. Free wifi but a bit fiddly to connect. Prompt room service for evening meal. Nice bars. Breakfast is ok though I thought the full Irish was a bit limited, but hot and tasty. It's a smaller affair than the Shelbourne or Westbury but definitely up there in standards. ",4,2016,03,11
202,Great location,"Ideal hotel to explore a busy area of Dublin, including Trinity College (across the street), shops, restaurants, temple bar area. Very friendly doormen! Felt safe walking around at night.  Highly recommend getting dessert at Queen of Tarts by Dame Street!",4,2016,03,09
202,Top notch,"From the moment I pulled up in the car I knew I made the right choice. 
The level of service and attraction to detail is unparalleled. The size of the room and standard is well beyond what I expected for a city centre hotel. 
Mint bar is a great place to unwind and relax ",5,2016,03,09
202,"Warm, welcoming, helpful and a great location!","We were able to use Starwood guest points for our trip for the hotel which was wonderful. The hotel was the perfect location, a 2 minute walk from the Temple bar area, backed up to Trinity college and was only a 15 minute walk from the Guiness Storehouse. The concierge was very helpful in finding us dinner reservations for both a Saturday and Friday night! One woman at reception was a little frustrating but overall the staff was so great and the hotel so beautiful, we couldn't have asked for anything better!",5,2016,03,07
202,Gorgeous room for General Sessions!,"The Banking Hall was a magnificent room for our General Session presentations at our conference!  The surrounding spaces were lovely as well, and presented a charming space for our event.

Sadly (but a good problem to have), our numbers ended up being too large, so we outgrew the space before the Westin had a chance to keep up (event surveys had very poor feedback on the food, however, I feel it was simply hard for event catering to manage the numbers we were pushing on them last minute - as the hotel breakfasts were FANTASTIC)! 

I do have to say that the staff was some of the best I've ever known (from sales to housekeeping). Truly a delight to work with, and I'm sad we're too big to come back for our next event.

Not to mention my in-room massage was on a caliber I expect from sports medicine practitioners - very very good, and so needed after walking in heels at event.

Lastly, it was hard for the Irish locals commuting in for the conference, I heard, but for out-of-town attendees staying in the area - can't beat the location! Beautiful and walking distance from many attractions.

Loved it there, and would be happy to come back for a personal visit.",4,2016,03,05
202,Far Exceeded Expectations,"Perfect location in Dublin, right next to Trinity College and within walking distance of most locations.  The longest walk was about 30 minutes to the Guinness Storehouse.

The hotel is unique with great decor and the lobby is warm and inviting.  We visited in February and both fire places were going upon arrival.  The downstairs bar was absolutely beautiful and service was great.  I was obsessed with the Mint 500 and they actually gave us the recipe!  Impeccable service.  

To repeat customer service here was above and beyond.  Prior to arrival we received an email from the concierge to check in if we needed any information or assistance prior to arrival.  They found out it was our anniversary and we received a complimentary upgrade and in working with my husband had a lovely surprise for us upon arrival in the room with a delivery of Guinness once we got settled.  What a great way to begin our trip in Ireland.  I can't say enough about the people here at the Westin Dublin, they made our trip incredible and we can't wait to come back!",5,2016,03,05
202,Bit disappointed to be honest,"I travel to Dublin fairly regularly and being a Starwood Platinum Card holder I decided on this occasion to stay with a colleague at The Westin.

The hotel is perfectly located in the Centre of Dublin but unfortunately surrounded by roadwork‚Äôs which seem to have gone on for month.

It is a beautiful building and has been carefully restored, I was afforded a very nice suite on two floor but it was a little dark with poor outside light being let in, my colleague was also upgraded but his room was nothing special.

We arrived quite late on our first night after a day‚Äôs travel and were looking forward to a nice dinner, unfortunately the only place you can get an evening meal is in the basement bar, the menu was not particularly attractive, we both order the medallions of beef and it was adequate but certainly not what you would expect from a 5 star hotel, it was disappointing there was no other restaurant.

The breakfast was adequate, buffet style but you could order eggs the way you want them.

The staff at this hotel are so helpful and friendly, I hope the facilities improve.

This is a lovely hotel and for me spoilt at the moment by the poor quality of the food.",3,2016,03,04
202,Expensive but best hotel in Dublin,"Other than the price, which is high, even in Dublin and the fact it is often fully booked this is a superb hotel.  From the staff to the modern, well equipped rooms it us hard to find fault.  If i can get a room it is my first choice in Dublin",5,2016,03,02
202,"Great Location, But Take A Taxi!","The Westin in Dublin is a very comfortable hotel with an excellent location. However, the traffic around the hotel is very busy and the surrounding roads are narrow, confusing and some are one way only. So do yourself a favor and take a taxi to the hotel. What we did was fly into Dublin, took a cab to the Westin for a few days, then took a cab back to the airport to pick up a rent car for the driving portion of our tour of Ireland. You don't need a car to explore Dublin.",4,2016,02,29
202,Great location,"Had a nice stay in the Westin. 

Location is really central.

Stay and service as always is good.

One thing they don't tell you is that car parking is limited. Ended up having to park my car in a public car park. Not what you would expect from a 5 star hotel.",3,2016,02,28
202,Westin Dublin,"We received friendly and excellent service from the moment we arrived, exhausted, from the airport. The front-desk staff accommodated our request for early check-in, allowing us to catch a nap and be prepared for our business meeting that afternoon. Our room was clean, quiet and offered a nice view of Trinity College rooftops. The hotel is a short walk to the College and the Book of Kells exhibit. Our stay combined business and pleasure, so we needed two receipts from the hotel, charged to two accounts. This was also handled accurately and in a friendly manner. No attitude here! Once Dublin finishes the construction of the light-rail system, the entrance to the hotel will be free of construction barriers that are there now. We'll be back!",5,2016,02,26
202,"Great stay for business traveler, great location for the tourist","As I write this I'm in the middle of my second business trip in Feb, 2016 at the Westin Dublin, and I have enjoyed both stays at the property.  When compared to my January stay at the Ashling, I'd say both properties are on par for service, comfort of stay, and amenities with the Ashling being about half the price.  That being said, the Westin has a far superior location to all the attractions of Temple Bar and the sites of Dublin.

To recap my current trip, I arrived at the hotel at 0800 after taking a red-eye flight to Dublin.  The front desk has always been very helpful and in this case got me a very early check-in. I had a hearty omelet breakfast at the hotel restaurant (16 Euro), and after some rest took a stroll that in a short time included a pass-by of Trinity College, Dublin Castle, Christ Church, St. Patrick's, and then a return stroll along the River Liffey and back through Temple Bar.  Aside from the restaurant, the hotel also has the Atrium Lounge (have not been to) and the Mint Bar which has a very nice ambiance and I've been told good food as well.  Their availability of beverages is adequate, although other area options have much large selections.  My favorites to date have been the Bank for overall dining experience, VCC for a unique speakeasy drink experience, and Temple Bar for the Irish Pub experience.  Also if you prefer a quicker or lighter breakfast or cup of coffee there are two Starbucks just a few doors away where you can grab your refreshments and bring it back to the hotel lobby and sit in front of one of the two gas fireplaces while you wait for your colleagues / friends.

My room on the 5th floor overlooks the Atrium Lounge (pic attached).  I've chosen the Green option so can't comment on housekeeping, but any requests for extra bottled water for the room has been quickly accommodated.  The room is well appointed, comfortable, clean and quiet.  My previous stay was in a room on the first floor and at that level there is a bit of a drone of street noise but not enough to keep you awake.  The fitness center is a typical small space with a couple of treadmills, ellipticals, stationary bikes, a universal gym and flat bench for dumbbells.  For the most part it's quiet, but even with two other people in there when I arrive, folks tend to cycle out quickly enough that you can get a well-rounded workout in.  And I must say I have had no issues with either of my stay. 

In conclusion, if you expect to be sequestered in your hotel for your stay, there are other options in the city that have equal amenities at a lower price.  However I am considering a return trip with family, and the Westin would be my first choice for a return trip.",5,2016,02,24
202,Irish Luxury & Comfort,"The Westin Dublin was recently our home away from home.  It has a fantastic staff!  From the Bell Desk, Concierge, Front Desk, Bartenders, everyone is helpful and goes out of their way to make you feel at home!  Thanks for a lovely 3 days.",5,2016,02,22
202,Westin,"Service and lieu up to the level expected.
Well located in the heart of Dublin.
Temple bar is a two-minute walk, the Trinity college is at the corner of the street, the shopping area is 5 minutes away.",4,2016,02,21
202,Luxury right in the heart of the city,"I stayed for two nights between Christmas and the New Year.  The Westin is a bit pricey, but it's the best kind of pricey - you know, the ""I spent a lot of money on this and it's worth every penny"" thing.  From the warm and friendly welcome at the front desk, through room service, concierge and cleaners, to the helpful and efficient check out, the staff make this place what it is.  My room on 4th floor lacked a view, but it was large, perfectly clean, very quiet and had an amazing bathroom.  The bed was comfortable and the bedding generous and good quality.

The main restaurant was closed while I was there, but the Mint Bar in the basement provides jolly decent food and the Atrium Lounge on the mezzanine floor serves food and drinks all day.  It's usually booked up for afternoon tea, though, so avoid between 2 and 4 if you just want a drink.  Room service is fast, and food arrives hot and beautifully served on a tray or trolley. 

The Westin is convenient for central Dublin, just across the road from Trinity College and within walking distance of pretty well everything one might want to see.  The reception staff and concierge give excellent advice about what to see and how to get there.",5,2016,02,21
202,"Great service, good bars","I booked in for five nights for a business trip, and enjoyed it very much.  There is currently building work outside, but you can park on the road and the bell staff will come very quickly to collect it and take it: I was very impressed.

The room I had faced inside, and was nice and quiet, and a decent size.  It was lovely and warm, with a good bed.  The bath isn't huge, but was OK, and although the shower cubicle is very big, the shower head doesn't face out much, and isn't that high.  A very minor point, but if you're tall, it's a slight pain.

The Mint Bar (downstairs) is great: lovely cocktails, with a very large cocktail menu.  The Atrium Bar is also comfy, though the service could be a little slow.

The concierge staff were helpful, as well the reception staff.

Breakfast starts at 7am, and is there's a decent selection, with the option to have dishes prepared by the kitchen (though I didn't try that).

Great place to stay if you want to be staying in central Dublin.",5,2016,02,19
202,Great city centre hotel that is often forgotten about ,"The Westin is a super city centre hotel and I use it regularly - latest visit was yesterday for lunch which prompted me to finally write a review !

Great for small and large meetings... There are some beautifully grand rooms for large events as well as smaller more practical options.

I recommend both the lunch and afternoon tea menus as these are both delicious ( I love to dine in the relaxed atrium part of the hotel)

The chicken sandwich on the lunch menu is Tdf ... Parsnip crisps are delicious ... And the 'most peculiar afternoon tea ' is totally wow .

Note ! Healthy options are available and they're great with food allergies.

Don't forget the Westin on your next visit into town ! ",4,2016,02,19
202,A grander scale,As a Starwood preferred guest I always look to build my points up by staying within the chain of hotels when I travel. This place was different to most as it is very regal as opposed to modern but definitely pretty.,5,2016,02,18
202,Great location for fun or business!,"Great location next to Trinity University & across the road from the Temple Bar District. Rooms are all differently sized & shaped but very comfortable. Rooms over atrium best to avoid outside noise. 3 very good restaurants for dining, Exchange for breakfast, Mezzanine for coffee & sandwich & the Mint down in basement for dinner & a pint. The best thing about staying at the Westin is the staff, will do most anything to insure your stay is a good one!",5,2016,02,18
202,Time to renovate?,"I have recently been to Dublin for business reasons  with my team and decided to stay at the Westin Dublin. Of course when I have booked the Hotel none told me that there were huge works in from of the Hotel that made it difficult to actually get in and out from the building but this is not a big deal at the end. 
The Hotel is very well located, in a beautiful and central building. 
Rooms are spacious and comfortable, personnel is very kind and professional.. but of course something odd happened which I am still wondering how is it possible: coming back from our dinner we have found that they have started some works to renovate the wooden floor of the lobby and the whole thing was taking place that night. 
This means that at our arrival we have been guided through the back entrance to our rooms and especially that we couldn't sleep at all because of the tremendous noise of the machines they used.
Leaving the hotel at 6 in the morning to catch our flight, we looked and felt like walking dead.
Stepping out the lift we have found an horrible smell of floor painting waiting for us and a member of the staff that guided us through  along tour of kitchen and staff quarter to get out without ruining their new beautiful lobby floor, without one word of apologies for the situation..
I must say that at my arrival in Milan I have received a call from a very nice girl from the Westin that wanted to apologize and offered me some additional membership points and I have really appreciated this even thought I am not sure I would ever use my membership another time.. Two Westin experiences in different cities and each time found works and renovations going on, shouldn't the Group schedule a better time for maintenance?",2,2016,02,17
202,Very Nice!,"Westin Dublin By SPG is a real 5* hotel, nestled in the heart of Dublin.
Very centralized, located just across the district of Temple Bar.
Spacious, real huge and clean room, equipped with working desk (good for business traveler), flat LCD screen, mini-bar, coffee maker and a kettle. WiFi (free) works great.
Bathroom is also huge and very comfortable, equipped with all amenities that are required for the stay.
Superb breakfast.
Excellent, most professional customer service throughout the stay, check-in to check-out.",5,2016,02,15
202,A very simple request denied! üò°üòüüòî,"My friend and I recently stayed at the Westin. We have stayed here numerous times. I love the hotel, it's location, the Mint bar etc. However, on the morning of our checkout, we were looking for tea and a scone. That's all, not afternoon tea just tea and a scone. We were told at reception that they would gladly facilitate us in the atrium. The waitress informed us that she could not help us. Most of the tables were reserved for afternoon tea but there wasn't a sinner in the restaurant at that time. All we wanted was tea and a scone! And we clarified that we wouldn't be more than 20mins.  I understood if tables were booked for afternoon tea, but this was 12:05, the room was completely empty and yet imagine, we, paying guests, couldn't seem to get just tea for two and a scone. We were happy to go anywhere else in the hotel for the tea, not just the atrium and yet the hotel staff directed us to a coffee shop off grafton street, a 7min walk away. We were very disappointed, at they way we were treated over such a simple request. Will think seriously in future as to where I stay in Dublin. üòíüòüüòî",2,2016,02,14
202,Amazing,We had booked a junior suite and arrived and are room was amazing. Staff are so friendly from check in to check out . Come here every year never to be disappointed  would recommend to anyone . It's rite in the centre of Dublin city which is lovely. You are never to far from anything  ,5,2016,02,13
202,Really worth the 5 stars,"Incredible hotel, from the reception, to the toilets, rooms, suites, bars. Top quality. Very friendly staff in the Bar in the Mez, however I found the bar staff in the mint bar quite young, and  not as warm as upstairs. Great live Jazz music on the night, but we left shortly as there was a College ball function on that questionably took from the venue.",5,2016,02,13
202,Well Located and Good Sized Rooms,Centrally located to all with a very friendly and helpful staff. Room service is very good and reliable. Integration of old and new architectural elements is unique and differentiating. Excellent bathrooms! Construction ongoing outside front of hotel owing to the building of a light rail system - not terribly impactful or disruptive IF you're up and out of hotel for work during the weekdays. No issues at the weekend.,5,2016,02,11
202,Stunning Hotel ,"Stayed here with the wife for the weekend. Stunning hotel and in a brilliant central location. 1st class service from the staff. The bar offered a great selection of cocktails and the food on offer was lovely. 

The rooms are very spacious and of a 5 star standard ",5,2016,02,10
202,Great location with darn good service as well...,"Stayed at the Westin for 2 nights before Christmas while on a business trip. The hotel is right in the heart of Dublin. Just amazing location. Walking distance to lots of the attractions - pubs, restaurants, and sightseeing. 

Upon arrival, I was greeted warmly. I ended up with a corner room that faced Bank of Ireland / Irish House of Parliament. My room was spacious and well appointed. The desk was large enough to work from and the WiFi was stable and fast. 

Overall my experience was wonderful. Slept well and everyone was very helpful.

N*joy...",5,2016,02,09
202,"Superb Hotel, Great Service",Enjoyed 2 nights in the Oscar Wilde Suite - on two levels which was a lot of fun! The front desk staff were absolutely fabulous - nothing too much trouble and mede sure that I was well looked after. With it being a rugby weekend the majority of decent restaurants were fully booked but the concierge spent over 30 minutes finding me a great location to eat and booked me a table a job well done. I was treated to some lovely amenities in the room much appreciated. Very grateful tool the staff but in particular Jelena at front desk - quite wonderful. The bed's here are really comfortable (as are the Westin beds generally),5,2016,02,09
202,Excellent hotel in the heart of Dublin,"I stayed here during a business trip. The room was large, quiet and comfortable, the bathroom enormous (with a separate tub and shower), the free internet - adequate  - what else is needed? I did not have a chance to try the eating options in the hotel as it located right across from the entrance to the Temple Bar - the hub of evening entertainment in Dublin, next to the Trinity College and walking distance to lots of other places of interest in central Dublin.

There is currently a tram line construction taking place in front of the hotel making direct access to the entrance a little tricky, but it was not really a problem.",5,2016,02,08
202,Pleasant hotel and great location in Dublin.,I chose this hotel based on it being a Westin and on the location.  Both didn't disappoint.  I arrived early and very tired but was very pleased they allowed me to check in early.  The folks at the front desk and concierge were very friendly and helpful.  I really enjoyed the Mint bar in the basement which had excellent food and drinks.  I also enjoyed a great breakfast in the restaurant.   Even though there was construction going on with the rail outside it didn't really bother me.  The location was such that I could travel about the city and easily get back to my room to rest and then head out again.  If you don't mind spending a little bit extra I think this hotel is well worth it.,5,2016,02,07
202,Faultless,"best 2 nights sleep in a sumptuous double bed ~ location was perfect ~ no disturbance from outside roadworks ~ staff amazing ~ will definitely be back - excellent! 
Bathroom was luxurious ~ room large and lots of additional extras ~ would have liked some biscuits to go with tea/coffee but hey - everything else 109%",5,2016,02,07
202,Great hotel,"Great hotel, friendly staff, perfect location. Would not stay anywhere else when going back to Dublin. The staff went out of their way to make sure you felt welcome and to assist with anything needed. They didn't wait for you to ask them, they proactively asked me before I even knew I had a need. The location is perfect for going for some pints or going to nice shopping places and allows you to experience the true Dublin. ",5,2016,02,07
202,Afternoon Tea - A Delight.,"We had a wonderful experience of having afternoon tea in the Aterim Westin on Saturday 29th January.

202,Mr,"Nice property overall in a great location. Some nice touches available ( fitness gear available to rent, for example.) Didn't eat breakfast but the menu looks expensive. The bathroom was large and well appointed but the extraction fan didn't work and there was some evidence of mould that hadn't been cleaned in the shower, which was disappointing for a property of this standard.",3,2016,02,01
202,Beautiful Property,"we were only here for one night, and were able to check in after a  red eye from Boston at 6:30am! The staff was very helpful and friendly, the door man were both great! Clean rooms, comfortable beds and perfect central location!",5,2016,01,29
202,room location can make or break your stay here,"we arrived around 9:30 a.m. local time from the airport, tired as expected. i had optimistically requested an early check in, and was very, very pleased to be in our room by 10. had booked and paid extra for a ""deluxe room with city view, high floor"".  when we pulled up out front, we saw that the construction i had read about on TA was still going on.  the person checking us in told us our room was on the 2nd floor facing the street. not the high floor i was expecting, so i asked if there was anything farther away from the construction. he offered me an interior room on the 4th floor, which i (reluctantly) took, only because i had read here those were nice and quiet and we were focused on getting some sleep!  well...it was quiet all right, but it didn't overlook the nice atrium i had read about, but what amounted to a very large, covered air shaft, looking straight across to other rooms.  we caught up on our sleep beautifully that first day, but after that the room was sort of depressing. we could not tell what the weather was like outside at all, could barely tell if it was day or night!  we tried to just put up with it, but after a few days we felt like we were living in a cave, so we asked if there was a city view room available for us to switch to, since that was what we had reserved and were paying for the whole time. despite one of the staff members previously telling us that the hotel was below 50% occupancy, they gave us a bit of a runaround, which surprised me. it was at that time that they explained that the 2nd floor room originally offered to us was technically 4 floors above the construction (ground floor, mezzanine, 1st floor, 2nd floor) and would not have been noisy! i wish they had told us that on the first day, and we would have been happy to take it instead of the cave!  they offered us an upgrade to one of the writer's rooms (not a suite, the same size room but with a city view & a balcony).  great, except they wanted to charge us extra for it! i went online to their own website, which showed that same upgraded room for a price lower than we were paying for the original deluxe city view room & obviously lower than the up-charge they wanted us to pay! we only had 2 nights left in our stay and i could not believe they would not automatically upgrade us for the 2 nights, when we had been overpaying for the previous 4. they said it had been our choice to reject the original room they offered us & did not care that no one had explained to us that the 2nd floor was really 4 floors up & not directly above the construction.  in the end (around 5 p.m.), they did upgrade us to the writer's room at no additional charge, and even sent us a basket of fruit, but i must say the experience was unpleasant and unnecessary and when we return to dublin in may, i doubt we will return to the westin.  it is a shame, because the hotel is very well located and very nice, just what we have come to expect from the westin brand (did i mention we are spg members?).  all the employees were very nice and helpful, even if they twice royally botched the room situation. breakfast at the exchange was very good (need a knife at the buffet for cutting bagels, tho). we had a good meal downstairs at the mint, tho as it is below ground, it was a bit dark and gloomy (sensing a theme?). one more thing to note. when reviewing our bill, we noticed several expensive items from the mini bar were charged to our room. we had consumed nothing from the mini bar, but had rearranged it a bit to store some of our own items to be kept cold.  when i reported this to the front desk, they explained that there is a sensor that detects if items are moved (!) and they immediately removed the charges. we liked the green program, where they compensate you for choosing not to replace towels, etc daily, with your choice of spg points, a credit for food, or a charitable donation. so...i would recommend the westin when the street construction has moved on, and then only with a city view room, unless you are nocturnal and don't need to dress for the weather.",3,2016,01,28
202,"Gorgeous Hotel, Excellent Location","I stayed at this property using a combination of cash and points, and I'd say it's the best SPG property I've been to, and quite possibly the best hotel I've stayed at. The decor is beautiful, the rooms are well well appointing with stunning marble bathrooms, and it's in the very heart of Dublin (right by Trinity College, Grafton St, the Temple Bar). The staff was fantastic, and did everything they could to make it a wonderful stay. If this property were in the US, it'd be a category 6 or 7 SPG property (out of 7). If you're looking for a hotel in Dublin, for business or leisure, you can't do better than this.",5,2016,01,28
202,Good hotel,I come to Dublin on business regularly (one a monty or thereabout) . The westin at college green is a good hotel in a lively part  of town (right next to Trinity college) . I recommend it regardless if the traveller is here on business or pleasure,5,2016,01,28
202,Gorgeous hotel,"Lovely hotel - the building is gorgeous, really great staff who looked after us well including giving us an upgrade and letting us have a late check out all for free!

202,A Top Notch Irish Welcome ,"My husband and I have stayed at numerous Starwood properties (and are platinum status) throughout Europe and were excited to begin our first trip to Dublin at the Westin. It's a special level of comfort we get most every time we stay within the SPG group, and the Dublin Westin proved to be a wonderful experience. Upon our early arrival, Jenny greeted us with a big smile and a beautiful room, with a view, just in time to catch some much needed sleep. The cozy lobby with a fireplace and lemon infused water was a nice retreat and the large bathroom inside the room was a dream. Jenny was so helpful with local restaurant recommendations and even printed a few tickets and itineraries out for us throughout our three day stay. She really made the Westin feel like home each and every time we came and went. It was a great surprise to see Jenny again, upon check in, when we returned to the Dublin Westin after a quick trip to London. Overall we loved our comfortable stay and are thankful to have made a new friend in Ireland. ",5,2016,01,26
202,Amazing experience,"This place was superb!

From entering the building till we left we were treated like royalty and everything was done with a smile. Both of us really enjoyed our traditional afternoon teas,was so much better then I had expected! Such a cosy spot to enjoy some family time. We will most definitely be returning to try the peculiar tea next time. Thanks to all the staff at the Westin for making our evening so enjoyable. ",5,2016,01,23
202,Excellent urban experience ,Perfect city location. Walking distance to all parts of rhe city. Clean rooms and excellent service. Beautiful building. Concierge was friendly and attentive. Nice to also be connected to the downstairs bar/ restaurant. Our room was on the small side but expected in that urban location and in such an historic building. Didnt bother us at all. Excellent weekend at the Westin Dublin!,4,2016,01,21
202,Good Westin with exellent location,The location of this Westin is pretty hard to beat and is very comfortable. We were initially given an internal facing room but on request changed us to an exterior facing room. I am not a fan of interior facing rooms we was pleased that they were accommodating. The room was spacious as was the bathroom and the shower was very nice. If we visit Dublin again I would look no further than staying here again.,4,2016,01,17
202,Fantastic experience ,"This was my first visit to The Westin and I couldn't fault a single thing. From the moment we arrived we were blown away by the level of service provided by your staff. We were checked in by Keith who was incredibly helpful. We had tickets to a show in the Bord Gais theatre and he provided us with a map and suggested a walking route that would bring us by some lovely Christmas markets. Despite the fact that his badge said he was in training, it is the most impressed I have been by a hotel check-in.

The room was perfect and so comfortable. We were in walking distance of everything in Dublin City and took a stroll down Grafton Street the next day before attending afternoon tea in the hotel's Atrium Restaurant which was delicious.

We definitely hope to be back again!",5,2016,01,16
202,Always warm and friendly,This was our second trip staying at Westin Dublin and we really enjoy this hotel and the very friendly staff! They are so accommodating and helpful and we would definitely recommend this location- easy access to most of the things you need to see or get to and across the street from all the nightlife of Temple Bar!,5,2016,01,15
202,Pefect location with fantastic staff,"Overall I was happy with my stay at the Westin. 

I had heard about the hotel being one of the best in Dublin, and went there with high hopes. Unfortunately I feel the hotel doesn't quite meet the 5* and reputation it has, due to small minor things that actually really make the difference between exceptional hotels.

The concierge was as expected, with meeting outside hotel and taking our bags to reception. I know it sounds quite petty, but this is where concierge stopped, and we took our bags to our room.

The room itself was an inward facing room, with windows overlooking one of the bars in the hotel. This meant no fresh air, with an air conditioner playing the part of open windows (never the same.) The bed was good, but the duvet and covers were a real nightmare, and we often stripped these off. With an inward looking room, there was no natural light, but there were only 2 main lights in the bedroom which didn't light the room at all. 

The bathroom had a hole in the ceiling, which wasn't looked at once whilst we were there. The shower also didn't sink, so a 5 minute shower ended up with myself standing in 4 inches of water. 

The staff across the hotel were extremely helpful and kind. They play a big part in the hotels high reputation.

Location of the hotel is perfect with Temple Bar opposite, and restaurants and shops just round the corner.

All in all, I was very happy with my stay at the Westin, but felt that standards had possibly dropped slightly, with the small but noticeable benefits of 5* quality.",4,2016,01,15
202,Best location in Dublin,"First time visitors to Dublin and this hotel is defiantly central to everything.

Staff were great, and even though the tram line is being built outside the front door we would,defiantly come back.

Great basement bar.
Just north of river so easy to get anywhere.",5,2016,01,12
202,Returned to the Westin,"Probably the best hotel experience I have had in years.  The rooms are quaint, well appointed and the beds are to ""die for""! 
The service is exceptional and the location is unbeatable.  Next door to Trinity College, 5 minutes to Grafton Street (shopping) and across the street is Temple Bar!  Cost can be high during sporting events but reasonable during the shoulder seasons. This hotel is at the centre of the city.",5,2016,01,07
202,Afternoon Tea in The Atrium,"Afternoon tea in the atrium was enjoyable, sat in lovely comfy big armchairs, the service was very good and we were well looked after. Nothing was too much trouble and the options set out before were tasty and well received.",4,2016,01,07
202,"Amazing Hotel, Amazing Location!","A friend and I stayed here early in December and I have to say it is one of the nicest hotels I have ever had the pleasure of staying at. From the moment we walked in to the moment we left we received an excellent standard of service, all staff were friendly and helpful and always greeted you with a smile.

The rooms were lovely too, we had a twin room and it was huge. The beds were the most comfortable thing I have ever slept in and the bathroom was beautiful. The hotel itself was in the perfect location for transport facilities (near to tram and train stations) and our airport transfer literally stopped outside. 

I really can't say enough good things about this hotel and I recommend it to anyone considering visiting dublin!",5,2016,01,06
202,Another gret stay at the Westin,"This was our second stay at The Westin, last time during St.Patricks and this time through New Years. As last time we do not have anything to complain about. The service is very good, location is brilliant and sleep quality is very high. Only drawback was a bit slow service in the bar, but nothing major. The hotel is a bit on the expensive side, but they are worth it. Will definately stay again next time I'm in Dublin.",5,2016,01,06
202,Almost perfect,"Warm greeting on arrival by the concierge Had lunch in the Mint Bar in basement. Service both friendly and helpful. Full marks to waitress. Food lovely. Will be back. Only one complaint, bar not very warm. ",5,2016,01,05
202,Wonderful Hotel in Dublin,"Superb hotel. Communications excellent. Concierge team were in touch about our plans for New Year's Eve. My wife's birthday. We booked a meal at the hotel and the team booked us in two excellent restaurants for the other two nights. Emma Mullen organised us a table in the mint bar to see the new year in with a live band. She like the rest of the staff couldn't do more for us. 

The location cannot be beaten everything is within a 10 minute walk radius. The room was peaceful and lovely and was refreshed twice a day. The Westin has a beautiful  mezzanine where, we had afternoon tea and complimentary biscuits. The beds were the most comfortable we've slept in and loved the rainfall shower. Liked the fact that that the bath and shower were separate.

Comfort, style, outstanding service and location made this a very memorable visit. Fully recommend. ",5,2016,01,05
202,Top Class,"Called in on New Years Eve for a drink on the way home around 7pm.
Sat in the upstairs bar beside the fire. Heaven. The 2 staff that I dealt with were excellent. What you would expect from a hotel of this class. Even though I live in Dublin I might even treat myself to a nights stay because I was so impressed.
Well Done",5,2016,01,04
202,FANTASTIC HOTEL ... A MUST,"We took time looking on the Internet for hotels in central Dublin and boy did we chose the right one. I couldn't fault The Westin at all. It was very grand, extremely clean, friendly staff, fantastic location for O'Connell Street, Grafton Street, Temple Bar and Trinity College and the staff couldn't do enough for you. We stayed there for 3 nights to see the New Year in. As soon as we arrived Alan the concierge took our bags for us. He was very helpful, he helped us with where we wanted to visit and generally guided us the right way. The rooms were very spacious and had everything you would want. They were cleaned daily, and I'm very fussy, but couldn't fault anything. Mo the concierge introduced himself to us and showed us round the hotel, explaining all about it, which was very interesting.  It was good to have a little tour as we hadn't been round it ourselves. He was extremely polite and helpful as were all the staff at The Westin. I would definitely go back there, as it was perfect in every way.",5,2016,01,03
202,consistently positive westin experience,"Good location, lovely rooms, good westin service.  excellent, bountiful breakfast buffet.  The room was comfortably large.  Easy walk to lots of dublin attractions.  Mint Bar is a cosy spot to grab a cocktail.  concierge gave helpful advise to plan the days out",4,2016,01,02
202,Relaxed New Year's Eve in comfortable Room,"We spent the turn of the year at the Westin and really enjoyed the relaxed atmosphere. Our Room with a view (500) offerd a great view over the southeastern City of Dublin including Trinity College. The Heavenly Bed was a true treat. There's a wardrobe, enough space for luggage and plenty of clothes hangers. I really appreciated the daily restock of the toiletries and the fresh bottles of water as well. The room was surprisingly quiet. Both, The Mint Bar and The Atrium Lounge are worth a visit! Tasty Cocktails at the Bar and beautiful and delicious Afternoon Tea at The Atrium Lounge. ",5,2016,01,02
202,Great stay!,Brought my team over for a Christmas party weekend and we couldn't have stayed at a nicer hotel! Brilliant staff and excellent facilities with a great bar/entertainment in the basement to boot! Definitely recommended,5,2015,12,29
202,"Nice hotel, but not the 150 Euro Christmas Day dinner","The hotel is lovely, but stay away from their over-priced Christmas Day dinner. This is not held in their restaurant but in a decorated ballroom. For 150 Euros a person, this should not be a buffet, and with such everyday fare. The carvery section held ham and turkey, and there were oysters and prawns on the side (but prawns in the shell and not cleaned). No hot greens except for boiled sprouts. The pumpkin ravioli was dried out and stuck together in the chafing dish. A buffet means multiple trips up for various dishes, and more so if you have children or elderly people in your party. Our table near the food meant waves of people passing by and milling by our table. It was also loud, too loud to hear the three musicians sitting behind the food. We were offered champagne upon entry, but during the dinner, we could not order a glass of wine. Only bottles or cocktails. Really?? We were truly disappointed and did not feel we got our money's worth. See images for the dressed-up families elbowing for space at the buffet. One woman began hoarding the chocolate Santas at the dessert area...because there weren't enough for everyone. We will not be going back for this event.
Otherwise, this is a very nice hotel with a terrific staff and the restaurant is fine.",4,2015,12,28
202,Fantastic lovely stay best in Dublin ,"Hotel is great my room was spotless the hotel is so cosy it feels like home. Great work with the new breakfast buffet love it especially superfoods. The hotel is so central easy to get to anywhere.

As usual the staff are friendly and helpful. Lovely check in and the restaurant staff were very helpful there is a real sense of genuine care.",5,2015,12,24
202,Amazing Hotel,"I've stayed in Dublin many times but this hotel is a cut above the rest. The staff, the room, the bed, the facilities, the bar and the breakfast were all outstanding. I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone wanting to stay in Dublin for any period of time. ",5,2015,12,23
202,Fantastic Experience,"Catching up with reviews fellow travellers.

Just had weekend night at the Westin Dublin.

Was really fortunate to be upgraded to the Presidential suite, named 'College Suite'- we had our own library and steam room, shame the private gym equipment now removed from my previous stay in that suite.

Really good throughout stay from Mint Bar ( great new Manager, who worked there before now back!), to excellent service at breakfast.

Plan to return soon.

Really recommend",5,2015,12,22
202,Great Hotel in a Great Location,"Booked the Westin via Expedia for a long weekend for my myself, wife & daughter.  On arrival the front desk was more than happy.  We requested a King room with a roll away bed for my daughter.  The roll away was more than adequate and the room itself was big enough so that the extra bed did not get in the way.  I stayed in a number of hotels where we can't walk around the bed with the additional of a roll away - certainly not the case here.  Room was large and clean.  Bathroom very impressive with large bed and separate shower.  4th floor meant we did not hear too much noise during the night.  Had a number of meals with friends in the downstairs Mint Bar which were of a very good standard and not stupidly priced.  Location wise - perfect.  In the heart of Dublin and within 5 minutes walk from Grafton Street, Temple Bar and O'Connell Street.  Bus from the Airport even stopped right outside.  To be honest - I could not fault the hotel - congratulations to the manager and staff who all contributed to a great weekend.",5,2015,12,21
202,A girls weekend treat,"Myself and my good friend have a tradition of getting together in December and doing a luxury overnight in Dublin -- Nice hotel, shopping, nice meal and maybe even a spa treatment. This year we were late booking our usual location and so ended up in the Westin Hotel. The room was beautiful - although no view - not a big issue for us though. It was a wet and windy day so we started with lunch and wanted a few bubbles to go with it. However the bar had a challenge in that the person who had the key to the Champaign store was not in yet and there was a bit of drama trying to get a key - In fairness they apologies and eventually found it. We also had pre-booked into the restaurant for dinner that evening and I have to say the food was mediocre at best ‚Äì There was limited choice because it was a ‚Äúfestive‚Äù menu and so we asked could we order from the menu in the bar ‚Äì we were told no. We then asked for cocktails from the bar and were told initially no but then got a yes. The restaurant was practically empty (only 3 other tables) and had no atmosphere. Very disappointing. We lost all Christmas cheer and ended up going to be early. 
The next morning the breakfast buffet was excellent ‚Äì a big difference from the previous evening.
On the plus side when we returned to our room on the Saturday after shopping there was a beautiful bottle of wine and a selection of cheese that was given to us complementary (not sure if this was to make up for the challenge getting the bubbles earlier or a general thing ‚Äì there was no indication) 
On balance a pleasant stay ‚Äì but given the poor meal on the Saturday evening I would not stay there again.",3,2015,12,21
202,"Open Fires, Relaxed Bar and Good Rooms",The atmosphere of the hotel is great; there is a degree of formality but it isn't overdone and there are enough light touches to avoid it all becoming too much. I wish the late breakfast upstairs had had just a basic cooked breakfast when I arrived a little late on the Sunday morning but that is a ridiculously small gripe. The bar downstairs was buzzy but cosy and the fires in the halls give a welcoming feel. The room I had was good - spacious and with a well laid out bathroom. All in all a great place to stay if you are Dublin.,5,2015,12,20
202,Mo!,"This hotel is becoming one of my favourites in the world. During my latest stay I had a wonderful toom on the SPG floor and enjoyed the newly designed breakfast room. Lovely entourage and great (super) food. 
After checking out, I had only one hour before my plane would depart. Then I realised my glasses were still in the room. The amazing concierge Mo fixed everything and got me on time at the airport. Thanks!",5,2015,12,19
202,Such a great cosy hotel in the heart of Dublin.,"Ive stayed at his hotel many times. This time the stay was just great. Walking into the lobby is just lovely, two open fires and friendly reception staff welcome you to their hotel. I was given a Deluxe suite on the first floor corner of the hotel which was lovely. It offered a nice but quiet view. 

The suite was lovely, It like the rest of the hotel has been renovated in a tone of beige, greys and cream, the two bedroom suite was very comfortable. 

I enjoyed breakfast very much the next morning and basically over ate my way through the cold and hot buffet. Parking was also easy, the offer Valet parking under the hotel. It is not very expensive. 

The location is super great, just across the street starts Temple bar, Trinity and grafton street is around the corner. 

Very much like this hotel and it is the only hotel i would stay if i would be in Dublin.",5,2015,12,18
202,Great Dublin Hotel,"The Westin is located in the center of Dublin, adjacent to Trinity College & near the river.  Great rooms in a former bank building. A great spot to explore all of Dublin.  Hotel has a good bar in the lower level and lots of pubs and restaurants in easy walking distance.",5,2015,12,17
202,"One night, fantastic expeience","I had occasion to stay again in the Weston in Dublin. It's my second time here and the quality of service from the staff and the room I had made the trip very enjoyable.
There are some road works happening outside the hotel as a result of the new tram, but the concierge made every effort to ensure it had no impact on my arrival. Service in the mint bar was great and the overall experience will ensure I will be back.",5,2015,12,17
202,Great Hotel,"I have mixed feelings with 5 stars on this review but will stick with mostly good comments, yet a few downside points to note. The hotel is located on a heavily traveled street, so there is some noise to contend with. At the time of our visit they were ripping up the street out front for new rail lines so it was a real mess. No fault to the hotel but terrible access problems to even hail a taxi. I would suggest getting a high level room near the back of the hotel to avoid street noise, as our room was on the first floor near the busy corner. Sleep quality was a bit compromised. Beyond this problem the hotel is quite lovely. Very nice d√©cor and rooms are good sized. Great bed and linen quality. Nice sized marble bathroom with both tub and shower. Robes and slippers provided. In room coffee and safe for valuables.  Staff was friendly and efficient. The location cannot be beat, as you are steps from Temple Bar area for pubs and dining, Trinity College and Grafton street for shopping. Breakfast is quite expensive if you don't have a package deal with your room charge. The Atrium lounge is a nice quiet spot with relaxing atmosphere and a good place for tea or a cocktail. They have a nice workout room with some cardio equipment. There is a high end restaurant off the lobby and a less expensive food and bar area on the lower level. We ate a yummy lamb burger down in the bar.  If you can afford this place then it is worthy of a stay.",5,2015,12,16
202,Quick service with excellent receptions staff,"Our work Christmas party was here, the staff were very friendly but special thanks to the night reception staff (George and his colleague) who were extremely attentive and put up with our complaints about sore feet while we looked for mobile phone chargers. They were extremely friendly and courteous!

I would recommend the Westin to anyone.",5,2015,12,15
202,Fantastic luxury hotel,"I love Starwood Hotel properties and snuck over to Dublin for a cheeky shopping weekend, easy to get to from the Airport and right in the middle of everything, food, shopping and nightlife.

The entrance hall is grand and very welcoming, the rooms are impeccable as expected. This hotel has an amazing cocktail bar in the cellars and we also booked the afternoon tea, I had the 'most peculiar' and my wife had the traditional... fantastic and opulent.

Cannot recommend this hotel and chain enough, join the SPG club which is free and you'll receive discounts and perks.",5,2015,12,15
202,Excellent Central City Hotel,"We recently spent two nights at the Westin Dublin. After an extreme long flight it was just what we we needed to arrive at the Westin to a warm welcome from the doorman and other staff members, a very comfortable bed and a an excellent breakfast the next morning. The hotel is well positioned for shopping and restaurants, and is close to Trinity College. The Westin Dublin is everything we expect from a hotel of this calibre.",5,2015,12,15
202,Great experience in a perfect Dublin location,"Great central location with everything nearby. Hotel is equipped with all the modern amenities. Traveled with my sister and her fiance who is a starwood member and we were upgraded to suites which were beautiful. When traveling all day it's always enjoyable to come back to rest in such comfort. The staff was fantastic and attentive.. However, after a long flight across the Atlantic we did deal with a less then accommodating front desk associate. The person was not rude, but seemed disinterested in the fact we had called and specifically requested a king size bedroom instead of two doubles. The problem was taken care of but it took the manager getting involved (he was fantastic). I would absolutely stay again, well worth the extra cost compared to the surrounding properties. Pay for wifi which was pretty expensive so watch out for that extra cost",5,2015,12,14
202,Great visit to Dublin City,"The Hotel is right in the City centre ,built into an old bank ,the Architect id a fabulous job and making it into a beautiful hotel .
Food and service were excellent and all of the Staff from The Doorman to the household staff were friendly polite and helpful .
great for both business and leisure",5,2015,12,12
202,Great Location and Wonderful Staff,"My husband and I stayed during a quick weekend trip in November and couldn't have been happier with our choice of accommodations. The Westin Dublin's rooms are up to date, clean and well-appointed. Noise levels were minimal and the bed was, as usual, Heavenly. The breakfast buffet at this hotel is not to be missed! Concierge service was incredibly helpful and friendly and got us booked on a tour that we might have otherwise missed. (That said, make sure to stick to the concierge staff for advice and recommendations as a desk staffer incorrectly informed my husband that he did not require reservations at a certain restaurant and we missed out.) There is free wifi in the lobby and paid in rooms.

Finally, it should be noted that there is quite of a bit of construction going on in Dublin and to the street outside of The Westin Dublin. If anyone is a stickler for first impressions, the current set up might throw them off a bit. That said, the hotel is within walking distance of so much. Trinity College, Grafton Street, nightlife galore, public transportation if your feet get sore.

Also, there is a really fun bar with live music on the bottom level!",4,2015,12,11
202,Nice place to stay,This hotel is located in heart of the beautiful city Dublin. Every thing is very near by. Hotel is equipped with all the modern amenities which we can think. Services are at most and stuffs are very humble and helping.,4,2015,12,11
202,Great location; friendly service,"The construction around the hotel was disruptive as it obscured the entrance. But the staff were helpful and went out of their way to ensure the guests were well taken care of. Service was good, by Westin's standard. My room faced the main street so the noises from the nearby pubs can be heard. The hotel bar served fresh food and of course Guiness! my room was comfortable, well lit and well ventilated. Overall a great place to stay and it will be even better when the construciton work is completed.",5,2015,12,11
202,Excellent hotel ina  very central location,"Ideally situated for the city centre. Was not as expensive as I would have imagined. Food was pricey but didnt eat there as plenty of value to be had just a few steps away. Lovely room. Big for a city centre hotel. Excellent facilities. Very helpful receptionand concierge. Layout unique with central atrium allow room to have a view to interior of hotel.
Definitely recommend",5,2015,12,11
202,Responsive to feedback,"We stayed at the Westin Dublin for 4 nights at the end of November on a holiday in a Writer's Room. I had requested a view of Trinity College and high floor in my booking and both were granted. 

Service at the hotel was very friendly. There were a few snafus in our room and everything was dealt  with promptly, and we were comped a free breakfast. Also, we were granted a late check-out until 3pm, which was very much appreciated. 

We had lunch when we arrived in the Atrium restaurant, and lunch just before we headed to the airport in the Mint Bar. Both meals were fine, and I guess a bit pricey, but unsurprising since it was hotel dining. Gym is good. 

Our room on the 5th floor was nice, but was showing signs of wear and tear (despite being recently refurbished, I thought it could use a fresh coat of paint). The room was a good size, but the I think these were once attic rooms with slanted ceilings. Neither my husband nor I are tall, so it's fine, but I think would be annoying if you are. 

Location is very central, which was nice and we walked most places. Taxis easy to get when necessary. 

If we find ourselves in Dublin again, I'd stay here again.",5,2015,12,11
202,Christmas Work Party,"Had our Christmas party here 4th Dec. location of the hotel is great and decor is really nice. We had our meal in the exchequer restaurant. Firstly, it being a Christmas party for 60 people you would expect a nice menu. Nope, just one choice of starter, one main and one desert. And this at a cost of ‚Ç¨65 a head. When we enquired about more choices it would have cost another ‚Ç¨10 a head. So for ‚Ç¨65 a head you would expect the food to be excellent in a five star hotel. It was terrible , and I am being kind here. The service was average , the food terrible and I mean terrible. After the meal we went down to the mint bar. This was lovely , nice bar , good music , ‚Ç¨6 a pint and ‚Ç¨11 for a glass of wine. Can't comment on the bar food but can safely say that if that's the standard of food which we were served then I would stay away . Very disappointed and all were in agreement about this. ",2,2015,12,09
202,"Good location, good service","I have stayed here for one night only and hadn't much time to spend in the bedroom but there were some unusual and mostly positive features about it.

Our room was overlooking the now covered, inner courtyard of the hotel that is currently occupied by a bar. This on it's own was very unique as we didn't have an outside view at all. First I thought it to be a negative but then I considered the traffic around the building and reclassified this as a positive feature.

The furniture in the bedroom was very modern, grey carpets and black leather(or leather like, not sure) material on the chair and the headboard of the bed and light colored walls made the room funky and modern yet calm and accommodating.
The chair by the way was unusually shaped and was very comfortable even though due to my back problems I rarely find truly comfortable chairs.

The famous heavenly bed was comfortable as advertised, although I wouldn't go mad and buy one as I prefer firm mattresses. I do think it would be very comfortable for most people though.

The duvets on the other hand were not to my liking at all. There was a thinner one that would be suitable for warm evenings and a very heavy and thick one on top of this that would keep you warm even on the coldest nights. As I was sharing the room with someone I couldn't turn the room into an icebox or into a sauna - even though the air-conditioning would have allowed me to do so - so I had to choose from using the thin duvet and dressing up for the night or using the thick one and bathe in my own sweat. Let's just say it wasn't a good night.

The bathroom was very interesting and in contrast to the bedroom it was decorated in keeping with the characteristics of the building. All stone, all cold and equipped with a large bath but not with a separate shower. While the shower head was a modern one and provided ample amount of water with good water pressure it was uncomfortable to use the shower. The ceiling in the bathroom was somewhere about 2.1m high and as the bath is higher than the ground my head was nearly touching the ceiling (I am close to 2m in height) while I showered and the shower head was located in front of my face instead of being above my head.

The other annoying part about the bathroom was the door that consisted of two half doors that lock into each other in the middle of the door but the the frame wasn't wider than usual so we had to open and close both doors every time we wanted to use the bathroom. 
The highlight of the bathroom was the set of speakers on which we could listen to what was playing on the television. This is something that all high quality hotels should have.

The tea-coffee tray had an American style dripping coffee maker and very decent coffee to go with it.

The gym was a lot better than what you get in most hotels. It was equipped with a decent selection of machines and some free weights as well. It also had plenty empty floor area if you want to work on the ground.

We had the chance to eat in the Mint bar and to have breakfast and both meals were great. The bar staff however was a bit too casual and so was the service provided but the food was delicious.
The breakfast staff on the other hand was very friendly, polite and acted just how they should in an establishment like this. The food selection at breakfast was also excellent.

Over all I would recommend this hotel for travelers who would like to have a very comfortable bed in a stylish room at a central location and are not too fussed about formal service.",4,2015,12,09
202,Just lovely.,"Met some friends for afternoon tea here and loved it. Fabulous Christmas decorations, lovely service and good food. Very pricey but a lovely treat. Wish I could afford to enjoy more often but it's only for special occasions. Hopefully again ext Christmas!",5,2015,12,08
202,Quick trip to Dublin,"The location was excellent. Around the corner from Trinity College.  Can easily walk to everything.  The hotel lobbies were very attractive with old world charm.  Tea room as well.  Bathroom was very attractive, all white marble and lots of elbow room.  Beds very comfortable.  Breakfast was very good.  A good value when you eat enough to skip the next meal, which we did.  The concierge very helpful.  Be sure to go to the new exhibit, the story of Ireland.  Very moving video and actor depiction of Ireland from ice age through the recent conflicts.   In the Smithfield section of Dublin.",4,2015,12,08
202,Good hotel and fantastic location,"This hotel is located in a fantastic location right by the Trinity college and the river. My room was little small but I loved it. It is an old hotel with modern features. Service is very good. Shopping district is only 3-5 mins away and there are numerous restaurants around if you wish to try them. 

Overall a good stay and I recommend it. Be aware this is an expensive hotel.",4,2015,12,08
202,A very averge hotel but a hefty price tag!,"I was expecting far better considering the price of the room.  The duvet was not in its cover, no slippers, there was no vanity set in bathroom like I would definitely expect in a luxury hotel apart from one shower cap.  The bathroom products were cheap and nasty (however they did have Miller Harris in the loos in the reception of the hotel).  Breakfast was extra which I found staggering.  Reception failed to do my printing, it was a simple ten page copy job that never materialised which I needed for a meeting.

The menu in the atrium was non-inspiring but the staff were friendly.

I cannot recommend this hotel really, the place seemed tired and jaded and for 375 euros a night I don't expect that.  The location was good though but as for the rest of it, it needs a big shake up and a bit more care and attention to be taken.",3,2015,12,07
202,Great hotel in great location,"We stayed a couple of nights. Beautiful old world hotel, but with all the modern conveniences. We loved the Nesspresso machine in the room. Very fun and happening bar in the basement. You cannot beat the location. Right by Trinity College and the river. Also, adjacent to Temple Bar district, with all the night life it offers.

Many rooms offer queen size beds, so be aware, if this is an issue and book king bedded rooms. All rooms have separate showers and large bath tubs. 

Also, be aware that some rooms may have street noise from cars and people walking by after bars. So, choose wisely.",5,2015,12,06
202,Excellent service as always ,Thank you to all the Westin staff for impeccable service and actioning out of then ordinary requests. A good location to stay in Dublin for business or a long weekend. Particularly appreciated the room service menu and the chocolate brownie option after a long day working.  ,4,2015,12,05
202,PERFECT,"The location I think is the best you can have in Dublin. The hotel is a real 5 star treat! All the staff is amazing, very helpful and polite.  Morning breakfast was wonderful, various and really tasty! There is a lovely underground caffe/bar and an incredible cover courtyard perfect for afternoon teas. Can't wait to go back.  ",5,2015,12,04
202,Fantastic Westin!,"We regularly stay at various Westins, and they can run the gamut in terms of quality. This particular property is way up there. It has a far more upscale feel than many Westins. The staff was particularly attentive, the room was great, and the location perfect. We would definitely stay there again on our next trip to Dublin.",5,2015,11,30
202,Beautiful Hotel in a perfect location!,We had a beautiful suite overlooking Trinity College. Beautifully appointed room. The touch of luxury you'd expect from The Westin. It was also in a very convenient spot. Easy to walk around the city and get the main tourist spots.,5,2015,11,29
202,Wonderful Stay in the Heart of Dublin,"Just returned from a fantastic stay at the Westin in the heart of Dublin. The people in Dublin couldn't have been nicer and that was especially true of the front-desk folks at the hotel. Nichola was especially welcoming and lovely. 
The room was fantastic, and the bed lived up to its ""heavenly"" branding. 
The rooms are giant especially for European hotels. 
It was quiet as a church even though there is a massive streetcar construction project going on in front of the hotel. 
Great breakfast buffet in the mornings. 
This hotel is right in the heart of Dublin.. right next to Trinity College. It's the perfect spot for quick walks to the river, museums, shopping and the Book of Kells. 

We had a great view of Trinity College.
Room service was excellent. 
The only thing missing was a spa. 
I highly recommend this great five star hotel.",5,2015,11,27
202,"Good hotel, well located ","We stayed at the Westin for a quick trip to Dublin - it's next to Trinity college and about 200 meters from Grafton Street and the edge of Temple bar.  

In short I'd have no reservations about staying here again although I might explore other spots like The Westbury, The Clarence, or The Shelburne (Renaissance) or the Merrion as well. 

There was a good number of dining establishments - underground bar called The Mint, the Exchange was their street level restaurant and there was a little spot on the atrium that looked great for a late breakfast, lunch or cocktails. 

",4,2015,11,27
202,Afternoon Tea Delight,"I'll be the first to admit, I'm a bit of an afternoon tea junkie.  I've been to several places around the country and have plans to visit quite a few more.
I had heard great things about the Westin, and in particular the alternative afternoon tea, so couldn't wait to try.  I decided to try it out on a cold Saturday afternoon with 5 friends.  
The Westin is a beautiful hotel and the Atrium, in particular, was a stunning setting for our visit.  The tables are spaciously laid out either side of a lovely staircase, and the Atrium itself is impressive as you are climbing the staircase.
We were greeted very quickly by a waitress and our request to be moved to a table a bit out of the way, was granted instantly - we're a loud bunch and thought we'd impose on people less if tucked away in a cozy corner.  The waitress explained the two options for afternoon tea very quickly.  Three of us had already decided that we would opt for the 'most peculiar afternoon tea', while we waited on the remainder of the party to arrive.  We were brought our mojitos in a large tea pot and served in proper tea cups, and they were delicious and very morish.  Then came the food, a feast for the eyes and the soul.  I am a more savoury person and unfortunately afternoon tea everywhere focuses more on the sweet part, or at least that's how it feels in my stomach.  While afternoon tea at the Westin is no exception, both the alternative and the traditional (I have it on good authority) were amazing.  My favourite, aside from the Mojitos was the prawn cocktail filled charcoal cone and the tomato tapenade with goats cheese dipper, on the sweet side, the popcorn panna cotta with toffee popcorn crumble is delicious but was a bit too sweet on top of the banana and walnut bread, and the chocolate and caramel sea salt brownie.  One thing I was a bit nervous of trying was the confit of pork cheek, stilton and aioli, but it was really nice and I would have liked more.  
I also had a coffee and a gin and tonic, which were more expensive than other hotels 
The atmosphere was lovely and the hotel is decorated for Christmas so this added a magical feel to it and we all really enjoyed ourselves.  The staff were lovely, particularly the young waitress who served us, she dropped by a few times to check on us but was unobtrusive. The alternative afternoon tea is ‚Ç¨32.00 and the traditional is ‚Ç¨30.00, which for a treat is great value considering this was my lunch and dinner.  I would recommend dropping in her for the afternoon tea or for a cup of coffee",4,2015,11,23
202,"Predictable, But Can't Beat Location","I've staid in Starwood properties all over the world, and there is a quality and atmosphere that I've come to expect from them.  This hotel certainly lives up to that expectation.  It's a very nice place to stay, but not really anything unique or special.  The staff really did go above and beyond though, and we felt very well taken care of while we were there.

That said, the location of this hotel is unbelievable.  It is sandwiched right in between Trinity College and the Temple Bar District.  You can walk everywhere.  I don't think it even took us 10 minutes to get to the Book of Kells exhibit.  It's a bit further to Guinness and Jameson's, but we walked to both in a day without any difficulty.  

If you can swing it, stay here.  It will make the rest of your time in Dublin so easy and enjoyable.",5,2015,11,22
202,Perfect Stay,"We were impressed with the charm of this hotel upon arrival.  It was a rainy, cold day when we arrived but we were greeted at the taxi, in the street due to road construction.  We were ushered into a warm reception area with 2 fireplaces.  The Christmas decorations were up and beautiful throughout the hotel. Our brief wait in comfortable chairs beside the fireplace was relaxing and enjoyable. Our room was lovely, clean and very spacious.  I was delighted to find a stand-alone shower in our huge bathroom. Staff was excellent in every area of the hotel. The location was perfect.  We enjoyed breakfast, tea and the bar. I can't wait to return.",5,2015,11,22
202,"5-star Hotel, Staff, Location!","Located centrally. Walking distance from all the shops, restaurants, nightlife! 5-star property and highly recommended. The rooms were clean and spacious, the staff was friendly and helpful, the location could not be any better!",5,2015,11,21
202,High Tea at the Westin Hotel in Dublin.,We were invited to High Tea at the Westin. The Concierge was so helpful coming out to take our car and he asked us to give him ten minutes notice to drive the car out to the front when we had finished. High tea is served in a magnificent atrium with the most marvellous light and space.Our table was in the corner next to a large mirror was fabulous. The table was beautifully set with a startched white table cloth and napkins. Our hosts ordered conventional teas as well as a modern tea served with Mohito tea to start. Great idea. A thoroughly memorable afternoon. The young lady that looked after us was delightful.,5,2015,11,20
202,"Very, Very Good.","Top to bottom this is a classy hotel. Room was top notch. Guinness was fabulous. Service was brilliant. Amenities were excellent and the welcome from the staff was wonderful.
Congratulations to everyone for making such an effort to look after me (I had just got back from 28 hours travelling) it was very much appreciated!",5,2015,11,20
202,Best location,"Beautiful entrance, rooms good size, perfect location, beside trinity college, dame street, o Connell street bridge one minute walk, if you are carrying lots of bags shopping you need this hotel, fireplace in lobby, the taxi from the airport will cost you 60 euros to get into the city to hotel so I suggest uber or pre book a return ride into Dublin city on USA websites Ireland is very expensive!",5,2015,11,18
202,"Good location, tasteful hotel ",Just stayed one night. My room and the hotel were tastefully decorated. Room was large and centrally located near Trinity College. I appreciated that I was checked in early and they let me shower and change in fitness centre change room beforehand. Didn't try restaurant or bar so I can't comment on the food. ,4,2015,11,16
202,Total 5 Star Luxury,"We had a excellent stay at The Westin Hotel. We availed of the valet parking at ‚Ç¨25 over night. Our check-in was excellent, very professional and although our room was not ready our luggage was taken care of. We had lunch at The Westin which was good and tasty. 

Our room was pure luxury. Extremely clean and well presented. The bed was very comfortable so it enabled a great night sleep.

Breakfast was excellent with plenty to choose from. Fresh fruit, salmon, mini muffins, cereals and full tasty Irish breakfast.

The Westin is a great hotel in a great location with very friendly staff.",5,2015,11,16
202,"""Cheers"" to the Westin crews","Although at the very best, we appear at the Westin once a year, but like the TV show, it is a place where everyone knows your name (Perhaps the box of candy helps).  My past tripadvisor reports have sung the praise of the front desk crew, the location, and just about any thing you would want to measure in  a hotel.  This trip I was acutely aware of how professional the team was that got me from the street(currently torn  up) to that desk.First of all there was the crew represented so professionally by Stephen (sp?).  They got me cabs, into cabs(minor handicap) and up and down the ramp-all with their smile and my name.Once inside, Mo and his team of baggage  handlers looked after me..  They fixed the light in my cane(don't ask), even saw a bag that I had left with a friend to deliver to the hotel when I returned a week later, was not only looked after, but showed up in my room when I came back..  And the third tier, the concierge level, has continued the Westin tradition of top flight people.  To my favorite, Daragh, they have added two more seemingly cut from the same cloth of perfection.  They got me last minute Saturday night dinner reservations on a Bank Holiday weekend and booking on the popular new 1916 bus tour. These are just some of the example of how the crew took care of us from curb to front desk, turning us over to the highly professional front desk that got us early check in after a long overnight flight.  It is reassuring that even when the faces change, the smiles do not-nor do they forget your name.",5,2015,11,15
202,Great Stay,We arrived early morning after an overnight flight and they were able to check us in right away.  The room was quiet and the bed was extremely comfortable.  The hotel is located close to all the major attractions in Dublin.  Can't say enough of how impressed we were with the hotel - would definitely stay here gain.,5,2015,11,15
202,Great location ,Great hotel great rooms the beds where very comfortable and quite the hotel staff where friendly and helpful. Breakfast was lovely and tasty with a wide selection to choice from. The hotel Ideally located by the spire and post office tourist busses stop outside and the pub next door was well worth a visit ,5,2015,11,14
202,Great hotel in a perfect location!,"We love the Westin Dublin for it's location, but even more for the friendly and helpful staff! We were upgraded to a Writer's Suite, which was a lovely extra...thanks WD! 

Breakfast in the restaurant is great, with an huge selection of delicious buffet items, as well as an a la carte menu. 

We look forward to our return!",5,2015,11,14
202,This was a brief over night before we were heading to the airport the next day.,"Our room was very small, yet warm and comfortable. We were only staying for a quick overnight then heading to the airport the next day  back to the States. We enjoyed great cocktails and a light dinner upstairs. The location is perfect for sightseeing.",4,2015,11,11
202,Lovely central hotel,"We stayed here for a weekend break last weekend, and had a lovely time. Our room was spacious and really comfortable, with a wonderful, large bathroom. We had a room overlooking Trinity College, which was fantastic, and we didn't have any problems with noise from the street. The hotel is central and you really can walk to anywhere you would wish to go in under 30 minutes - the location really can't be beaten.
The staff were friendly and professional, especially the lovely doorman Alan, and the breakfast staff. There was plenty of choice for breakfast, and who doesn't enjoy a machine that makes mini pancakes!
We also had a drink in the Mint Bar - the cocktails were delicious and the atmosphere was fab.
Only slight niggle - Wifi was not included. In a hotel of this standard and price, Wifi should absolutely be free for all guests. You could use the business suite, but it's a bit annoying to have to go down there whenever you need to check anything online. I have stayed in 2 star hotels in the back and beyond of Vietnam where the Wifi has been free! 
But overall, a lovely stay and we would definitely return.",4,2015,11,11
202,"Good hotel, awful back office ","Getting a copy of a bill has proved an absolute nightmare.  The stay itself was great, staff helpful. But at the end of the day spending huge amount of time trying to get a simple email detailing room charges is a real hassle for those of us doing expense reports. As spg platinum I even engaged my ambassador representative to help resolve the issue and that has failed also. 

All it took was a simple email to make my stay wonderful But instead it's a hassle and headache.  ",1,2015,11,11
202,First 5 Star Experience - Set the Bar High!,"I was in Dublin for business from the states for just under a week. Got to the Westin at 10:30 AM on a Sunday morning, and was able to check right in. Very spacious room, comfortable bed, and beautiful marble in the bathroom. 

I cannot say enough about the staff here. The concierge staff and doormen are AMAZING!! Mo, Alan, and Gareth are awesome to talk to, and their recommendations are right on the money. 

There is construction going on out in front of the hotel, but this is not the Westin's fault, and I certainly won't blame them for it. 

When I come back, I will be staying at the Westin. Great central location with lots within walking distance, fantastic staff, and a very enjoyable experience. ",5,2015,11,06
202,Lovely hotel but lots of little issues,"I always enjoy Westin Hotels - they typically provide top service and comfortable rooms. This time, however, there were lots of little issues:
1. One of the 2 elevators was out for much of my stay. The desk staff said that the stairs only went to the Mezzanine. After a day of waiting too long for the elevator, I began taking the fire exit stairs down. After 2 or 3 tries I figured out which ones will let you back up (far left corner of Mezzanine, through door and first door on the right). They hadn't been cleaned nor carpet vacuumed in forever, but it was significantly faster than waiting for the one elevator - and you get your exercise, too. The staff should let people know that the stairs are available and where they are.

2. While their card keys sport yoga mats and other equipment, there were none to be found in the hotel. Housekeeping said they were all in the fitness room. Fitness room had none. I used a towel, but it was annoying.

3. Bad design around commode! The toilet paper roll holder is so close to the toilet that you have to sit at an angle, or bang thigh on the metal cover.

4. Halloween night, the place, including in my room, smelled like it was burning down. The front desk said it was bonfires outside, but I had no window opening onto the outside - the air was being sucked in through the heating system. By morning it was gone though.",4,2015,11,05
202,lovely Hotel in the heart of Dublin,The Westin is a relatively small but lovely hotel in the heart of Dublin. Based next the Trinity and near the River its the perfect base for shopping and sightseeing. Front desk area and staff on arrival were really friendly. We had booked the hotel as my wife was running the Dublin Marathon and I had requested a late check out and all of this was on their system and was mentioned on checking in which was nice. We had a lovely room overlooking a central courtyard and the room was a really good size with all facilities.,4,2015,11,04
202,Very Nice,"I stayed for 5 nights for work.  The staff were friendly, especially given less than gracious guests when I first arrived and the gal at the front desk (I don't recall her name) managed to not only be calm and composed but still welcoming and accommodating.  The rooms are clean and fairly spacious and quiet but a little dark. Its well situated near Trinity college and Grafton street but a bit of a walk to the Luas at the other end of Grafton. The bar in the basement is nice with great bar tenders who put more care into an Old Fashioned than I have even seen and of course pour a good pint. 

The breakfast selection could have been better, I was hoping to try out a full Irish Breakfast. Also there wasn't much in the way of views but that could have just been my room.",4,2015,11,03
202,Lovely Hotel,"Had a great trip to Dublin.
Choose The Westin as the reviews looked great and they lived up to expectations.
Very tasteful hotel, great rooms and the beds were really comfy.
Everyone was very helpful, had a lovely time.
Thank you.",5,2015,11,03
202,Afternoon Tea,"I made an afternoon tea reservation myself, my mum and my niece as they were visiting for the weekend so I thought it would be a nice treat.

Having had afternoon tea in a number of places, including Powerscourt, The Gresham and The Westbury, I was expecting a similar service.

However, I must say it was all very disappointing on arrival. We were seated at the bar as our table apparently wasn't ready - despite there being three empty tables in the room. Following that, a couple arrived and a table was created for them, using a space that would easily have fitted three chairs for us. Subsequently, two other parties arrived and were seated at the spare tables. One of these was a small party and therefore we could easily have been given that table on arrival. 

When we were eventually given a table it wasn't even set for afternoon tea. We were then waiting a further 5 minutes before we were even approached by someone to take our order - all of the parties that arrived after us were being dealt with first. I was so frustrated at that point that I advised the waitress we would be leaving. 

I emailed the hotel afterwards to advise of same and they did not even have the courtesy to respond.",1,2015,11,03
202,A '5 star' weekend in The Westin Dublin,"I booked this hotel to treat my fiancee to a special weekend as it was her birthday. It was NOT a cheap booking, and I expected the best. We were badly dissappointed. The hotel was pleasant, clean, & the staff very helpful, but thats where it ends. One of the 2 small lifts was broken (reported 3 times) for our entire long weekend (4 days), and after waiting so long for the one remaining lift (rated as 13 people, but only comfortable for 8) we had to use the concrete stairs several times (and I have a knee injury) - not exactly 5 star? The other problem was noise - we could hear street noise all night, and none of the doors had silent closing devices, so we were woken at 2, 3 & 4.00am by residents coming in late. We didnt have one nights sleep the whole weekend. Also our TV remote control didnt work properly( we had 'given up' by then), and there was not even one biscuit supplied with the in room tea/coffee. 5 star prices, at a 3 star hotel. We will NEVER stay here again, even if it was free. I actually felt embarrassed that I had booked this for her birthday, despite that currently our room would be 335 Euros per night excl breakfast.",1,2015,11,03
202,possibly the best in Dublin,"very specious room, good Wifi, excellent service. Old style hotel, but better than any other hotel i stayed in, in Dublin. location is very good, lots of shopping and restaurants all around. The gym is very small, breakfast not cheap (but decent).",5,2015,11,02
202,Horrible Experience,"This hotel is way overrated for what it actually Is! Check-in was a nightmare and not what one expects from a Westin hotel especially when you are arriving from a long overseas flight. While we waited for a room since we were actually early for check-in, we did not rush them and went to 2 different restaurants in the hotel. Being a Gold Starwood member they did have a room ready at 1:30 pm (check-in is actually 3:00 pm) but we had specifically had a reservation for a room with a ""City View"" and this room had ""NO VIEW"". The view was of a black chimney stack and if one looked up you could see some sky and sometimes a bird.However, we were so tired we just let it go until we had to have them fix the A/C 3 different times during that night. They changed the room the next day but were late in doing that as well. This room while supposedly an upgrade had bathroom problems. Would have moved to the Westbury hotel if they had occupancy. Would never recommend this hotel to anyone....the Westbury Hotel which we stayed in on our way home from Ireland is so far superior and was even less expensive!",1,2015,10,30
202,Short stay,Stayed 2 nights while in Ireland with my wife.  Very comfortable and clean as expected with Westin.  Rooms were nice with great bathrooms.  Service and staff were great.  Location was good also with lots of pubs and restaurants around.  Would definitely return for another stay.,5,2015,10,29
202,Afternoon tea - not a delight,"We arrived for our 2:30 afternoon tea appointment only to stand in the dining room for more than 10 minutes before a single staff member came into the already well occupied salon where the afternoon tea was being served i.e. all the guests in-situ had no one attending to them !   Thought this was supposed to be a 5-star establishment - if so, in name only.    This was a feature throughout the afternoon tea - no staff.  There was no such thing as your tea being topped up.  Perish the thought.  Indeed when we needed another pot and after no staff member coming by for approx. 20 minutes I went to the bar to ask the barman if he could request another pot for us (the bar in the room being the only spot that was staffed for most but not all of the duration).    Even at that it took another age to replenish the tea and the staff promptly disappeared again.  

A very offputtng experience which continued on a ""drip"" for the entire experience was a long continuous snake of either staff members or possibly course attendees who were obviously finishing work for the day trekked up the stairs which our couch overlooked, up and through the salon and out to leave the hotel, complete with laptop bags, coats, etc.   This went on and on endlessly and is certainly not conducive to a relaxed afternoon tea.  Overall I was shocked at the lack of staff throughout.   

Even little things like finding our name on the reservation list (booked a month in advance) was a problem.  They eventually decided that whoever took the booking did not have English as a first language and that another name beginning with the same first letter as ours must be our reservation.  There was a problem when we asked not to be seated perched in the open literally overhanging the stairs but eventually they did allow us to have the couch placed 4 ft away from the stairs.

Food was hit and miss - the second pot of tea was nasty, the first having been delicious but small.   Arranging to pay for the bill involved another age to attract the attention of staff.    Every single table was occupied for the afternoon lunch !  
The heating was overpowering and made the room very hot and stuffy.

On a good note the bathrooms were very well appointed and everywhere spotlessly clean.  The atrium is very nice with lots of light pouring in.    

Avoid.   Thoroughly disappointing.",2,2015,10,28
202,Perfect Location & Service,"We wanted to see Temple Bar, but be able to stay away from the noise and the night madness when we wanted to go to bed. This Hotel has easy driving access and it was perfectly located right across the beginning of the most fun street of Dublin. Cafes, bars, restaurants, markets and shops are at its doorsteps, but starts just across the street; so you will never be bother with noise or craziness at nighttime. Temple Bar Street goes for about 14-15 blocks starting across the hotel, so basically you are in the best end of the street.

The Hotel is impeccable as all the Westins around the world. Service cannot be better.  Big thanks to ‚ÄúPeter‚Äù among other concierges who were excellent and find out exactly we were looking for on food and entertainment. Sometimes some people cannot read your needs easily, but in this case, Peter hit the mark with all his recommendations. Thanks Peter and the Westin Dublin.",4,2015,10,26
202,Great location and very large rooms with comfortable beds and lots of amenities.,"This hotel is in a great location. The rooms are very large and they are very nice amenities.  Love that my name is on the TV as I walked in.  The room, though large is a bit short on lighting and the airconditioner was not working that well.  Beds are really comfortable and they do have a fridge and a safe. Also bathrooms are very large but the towels are a bit rough. Had to ask for a second bar of soap but that was easily obtainable. SPG is running a  program that if you decline housekeeping the will give you a 5 Euro Credit or 500 Starwoods points.  The concierge was helpful but not always as informed as they should be. They had no idea that certain trains were shut down for scheduled maintenance. The bar downstairs is a great place with great live music.",4,2015,10,25
202,One of our favorite Westins,"We stayed here twice in September as we went in and out of Dublin.  The location is superb, just steps from some of the best parts of Dublin.  There is a really romantic little mezzanine area, a bar with some food. It is furnished with comfy sofas, big chairs and little tables and  is in the center courtyard of the hotel and pretty unusual, loved it.

The bed was wonderful, very Westin, and the whole room was cozy and comfortable.

We were welcomed with a warm smile and hello at the beginning of each stay  by Alan, the doorman, and he gave us wonderful advice for a restaurant on the 16th, and last, night of our trip.  We wanted something different and super good and Alan came through.  He was also just very friendly and fun to talk to.  The Westin can be very proud of him.

What a wonderful hotel......we will stay here again when we are in Ireland.",5,2015,10,21
202,Excellent family hotel,"We had a one day stopover in Dublin and spent the night here. We were with our two kids - ages 1 and 3. The hotel went out of their way to accommodate all our special needs, making our stay very comfortable and pleasant. We stayed in a suite (starwood gold status - didn't even have to ask for the upgrade.) The first room we got smelled like cigarette smoke- possibly due to the construction taking place right outside. Our room was switched as soon as we complained, and someone was sent to help us move. Beautiful room, modern yet full of charm, everything was just like the pictures on their website! Top quality amenities, bath salts... etc. (I love that kind of stuff!) Very spacious. Plenty of room for a crib and space for our three year old, bed was comfortable and didn't hear any noise from other rooms. We eat only Kosher - the hotel stored our food in their freezer, warmed it up for us, and allowed us to eat in the atrium. New plates and cutlery specially designed for kids was given. The door man remembered our daughter's name - she was so pumped!! Staff was very friendly, wasn't fazed by little kids, bar was very nice, beer was very inexpensive, beautifully decorated and spotless hotel, very relaxing, perfect after a day spent traveling and running around.",5,2015,10,21
202,"Outstanding location, great staff, amazing breakfast","I spent a long weekend at the Westin Dublin and you really cannot beat the location for exploring the city.  You're right across the street from Trinity College, a stones throw from Temple Bar and Grafton Street - everything is within walking distance and easy to get to - Dublin Castle, the Archaeology Museum, you name it.  The room was very nice - I had booked a deluxe room, which ended up coming with two beds, even though I was on my own.  The bathroom was well appointed and had a separate shower and tub.  The breakfast each morning was incredible (was included in my American Express FHR rate) a really impressive buffet and you could also get eggs and coffee drinks to order.  What really made the stay for me, however, was the staff. They were incredibly helpful and went out of their way to make sure your stay was comfortable.  I would definitely stay in the Westin again!",5,2015,10,20
202,"Amazing location, lively bar, strange suite","My wife and I were guests for two nights, and I was lucky my Suite Upgrade was cleared.  The suite itsel was nice looking, but a bit strange. The bedroom and bath were on the level of entry,, but the separate sitting area was up a big set of stairs. It was lovely furnished, but because of the setup (upstairs  sitting area) , hardly used. 

The hotel location was incredible, next door to Trinity College, and across from Temple Bar.  Traffic around the hotel was all screwed  up because of an ongoing major road project. 

We lived the casement level car, but it dud close early. The brunch was Mediocre  at best, because for the last half hour food was not refilled or replaced.  All the staff were about cleaning and moving laggards out.  Not appreciated by one ho was in vacation, and looking for a nice breakfast.",4,2015,10,19
202,Amazing stay at Westin Dublin.,"The hotel was beautiful and centrally located to all the attractions we wanted to visit, all within walking distance.  The staff was very helpful in finding our way around and Mo in particular was a huge help.  Would definitely return on future vacations to Dublin.",5,2015,10,18
202,A week at the Westin Dublin!,"I have nothing but praise for the Westin Dublin.  Located right beside Trinity College, its central location made for easy access to the Temple Bar District, Grafton Street and St. Stephen's Green.  I walked all over Dublin and made my way back to the hotel with ease.  A delicious breakfast was included with my deluxe room and every staff member I had contact with was kind and helpful without exception.  If and when I return to Dublin, I will stay nowhere but the Westin.",5,2015,10,18
202,Westin Dublin gets my vote,"Westin Dublin is in a great location.  Across the street is the Temple Bar area which is a fun street area and short walk to the actual Temple Bar itself.  Be sure to eat at Gallaghers Boxy (spelling is wrong) which is on the way.

Westin staff make this so wonderful.  Huge SPG awareness for upgrades, breakfasts, etc. Front desk (Nicola and George) staff are typical of smart, helpful people who care.  Others too, right down to the doormen.  

At one point, we had ten rooms with our golfers all happily taken care of.  Both ends of our stay. You can consider this is ten reviews in one.  All positive in every way. Could not have been better taken care of.  Kudos to this Westin.

Rooms are quiet and nice.  Hotel is clean and classy with the heavenly beds and showers we all know Starwoods provide.  

The decision to stay here was easy.  We will all return for sure.",5,2015,10,17
202,are you kidding? #15?,"this hotel is so dated.. we are staying in a suite and it looks like it was recently renovated in 1982.... the room is nice enough and so is the view .. the lobby looks great...whatever happened to heavenly beds?   this bed is ok and certainly not heavenly... the bathroom has chips and nicks in the tiles, the toilet does not work.. the tvs are tiny and the wires are exposed.. the hotel however is clean and well located.. the staff is warm and friendly...i think that is ireland however... all in all i would look for another hotel.. i stayed at the westbury last time.. its around the corner and lovely",3,2015,10,17
202,Georgia,"An unexpected delight. We had an internal room which we thought might be a problem because of the lack of a view but what a surprise. The best bathroom I have ever experienced in a hotel. Mirrors did not fog up. Water pressure was amazing. Lighting was very bright( something I yearn for) and even though it was an older style for some reason the marble was warm underfoot. Very comfortable bed. The staff were pleasant, polite and helpful especially our lovely doorman. I would love to go back. It would feel like going back home and no I'm not Irish.",5,2015,10,16
202,Perfect stay,"The Westin Dublin is in the perfect location for visiting Dublin.  It is right across the street from Trinity College and near the Temple Bar area. The hotel was an old bank building that has been turned into a luxury hotel. The staff is amazing, they go out of their way to help you from the greeting to the doorman to the friendliness of the housekeeping staff. The rooms are all different but unique. It was a perfect stay.",5,2015,10,14
202,Westing at its best,"The westin hospitality and service is why you should stay here.
Outstanding staff from the front desk to housekeeping to the restaurants and lounges.
Must see lounge in this old refurbished bank building in the heart of Dublin.
Close to everything ,with a doorman that has any answer to your questions.
Top notch westin",4,2015,10,14
202,Average at best...,"I expected a little more from the Westin - especially after reading some of the other reviews. Our room was small (REALLY SMALL) and had a horrible view of the air conditioning. We told them we were celebrating our wedding anniversary and they didn't go out of their way to acknowledge us at all -other hotels on our trip send us champagne, gave us chocolates etc.. On the second day we were notified that the water would be shut off for several hours during the day - no showers or toilets. Really? I can't believe they expected us to pay full price for a room we couldn't really use 100%. The third day we had to endure hours of loud construction work, so bad we had to leave the room instead of resting before going out to dinner. The streets in front of the hotel were going through MAJOR construction, making it very difficult to get around. Avoid this hotel until the construction inside AND outside are complete. ",3,2015,10,13
202,"In Dublin for a long weekend Oct 11, 2015","Perfect location.  Next to Temple Bar, but not in the mayhem,  One block from Grafton and next door to Trinity College-no other hotel is better located.  Amazing staff.  Every person from the front desk, concierge and porters were incredibly warm and inviting.  Only negative is as the hotel is an older one, the rooms are smaller than a lot of the newer Westin properties.  They are in perfect order, just a little smaller.  But the location and staff more than make up for it.",4,2015,10,13
202,Beware of overbooking!,"We booked this hotel after much research, primarily for its location. When we checked in, we were told that they were overbooked and that we would be accommodated at an affiliated property which was VERY FAR away. This is despite us booking over 6 months in advance and being SPG members. We were extremely disappointed and would not recommend this hotel unless you are prepared to be moved when someone more important comes along.",2,2015,10,12
202,Fab staff,"I didn't get chance to stay here but just wanted to leave a review to say thanks to the staff here, especially Ann Marie on reception. We had just arrived in Dublin and had been told by the B&B we had booked that they didn't in fact have room for us. We were subsequently left at 11pm with our luggage and no place to stay. We walked to the Westin (after trying 5 other hotels)  in hope they had a room for the night, unfortunately they were fully booked but after explaining to Ann Marie she helped us find accommodation at another local hotel for the full weekend.  Many thanks for the help, it was a 
life saver :)",5,2015,10,09
202,Modern Rooms in a Central Location,"Stayed here on two separate locations during the month of September and both experiences were flawless. As an SPG Platinum member we were upgraded to large, rooms on high floors. Both rooms were decorated beautifully. They had much more character than your standard Westin. The bathrooms were all marble tile, with large tubs.

The location is perfect. Across the street from the Temple Bar area and walking distance to several other Dublin attractions. Plenty of restaurant options in the area as well. The hotel was only a 20 min taxi ride to/from the airport. The taxi ride costs about 25-30E. 

We did afternoon tea at the Atrium Lounge in the hotel during our stay. It was a lovely, and delicious experience. Highly recommend. We didn't eat at any of the other restaurants, so can't speak to that.

Recommend staying here for anyone looking for a central hotel in Dublin.",5,2015,10,08
202,"Good Hotel, close to sights","We stayed at this hotel for a few nights, and liked the proximity to Trinity and Abbey theatre amongst other sights. We could walk everywhere. Our room faced the ongoing tram line construction in Dublin but it was very quiet. I would stay here again, clean, great sleep, helpful staff. It has a gym although we never used it.

The only downside is the price.",4,2015,10,08
202,Dreary and Outdated,"Our written reservation confirmation stated that we would have a room w/atrium view.  On arrival, we were given a room (facing an alley) with a very close view into a high-rise office building. The office windows were from ceiling to floor so we had as wonderful a view of the workers as they did us. When questioned about the room, management said they did not know anything about the confirmation and there were no other rooms for that night.  The manager offered to move us the next day and sent us a bottle of wine. He also offered to return some points.
That said, I can't believe this is a category 5 hotel.  Location is good but that's it.  The furnishings are very shabby and a mix of old over-stubbed pieces with something resembling rustic modern. The walls are dingy with scuff marks in many places.
On the whole, the rooms are dark and dreary.  What lighting there is is poor with fixtures too large for the nightstands so there's no room for much else.  
Room keys are required to operate the elevator but our keys didn't work.  We had them remagnitized but still had problems.  
 Yes, I understand this is an old building but that doesn't mean the interior should be so dingy and outdated.  This is supposed to be a luxury-class hotel.  We had just come from a luxury hotel in London that was also an old building but it had updates and was superb. This hotel needs serious updating and TLC!  
If location is your thing then this is the hotel.  I would not stay here again, not for the money or points.",2,2015,10,08
202,Could have been in New York,"Nice, very American Hotel in an area adjacent to Trinity College.  Service was OK but not by the standards of other Irish based Hotels.  Unlike other hotels in the same price range, breakfast was not included in our ""package""",3,2015,10,07
202,Good hotel and Location,"Overall a very nice hotel and the location is great.  Only downside is it can be on the pricey side. The staff was very friendly and helpful.  Close to Grafton shopping, Trinity College, Stephens green, natural history museum and Temple Bar areas",4,2015,10,05
202,"Our Westin, Dublin Stay...","We found the accommodations to be lovely, both with the room and its view (stayed on 5th floor with balcony and view of Trinity College) and the helpful staff. In particular, we were so very pleased with the concierge recommendation for a Brian O'Reilly who we hired for a private tour. It was more than we expected. We traveled out into the countryside to see a small village, Dalkey Castle, Powerscourt Estate, among other beautiful sites along the way. We loved our Dublin stay!",4,2015,10,05
202,Just Stunning & perfect location,"The best thing about this Westin is location - it is one block south of the temple bar district - close enough to walk, but far enough not to hear the noise all night!   The concierge was amazing, and helped us find some decent restaurants in the area that did not serve pub food.  The rooms were very clean and well maintained.  The rooms are well appointed and have plugs for all - ie. you don't need a converter!   They even have a USB plug in the room.  They even have a North American plug.  However, one of the two rooms we booked did not have a great view - room 443.  They told us that they upgraded our room to be bigger, because there was no view - so yes, the room is big, but the view is horrible - all you see is the roof of a building.  Our room, 440 was bigger as well - but at least we had half of a view - we also had the view of the roof, but half of it only.   Otherwise we were very happy with the service they provided!  The other issue is the lack of Wifi - I was able to get access to Wifi everywhere in Ireland except this hotel - we should not have to pay for Wifi when it is free in the city centre and all restaurants in Dublin - seems rather silly that a 5 star hotel makes you pay extra in this day and age.",4,2015,10,03
202,Good location,The hotel has an excellent locations in the heart of Dublin close to both shopping areas. The prices are ok for the location. Rooms were clean but a bit old style. Room service was quite fast and the food was ok. ,4,2015,10,03
202,a great way to end our stay in ireland!,"we are starwood members and when my husband was having problems with his back and we had to leave our b&b early, we booked in here for 2 nights. heaven! so wonderful to stay at a chain that is so familiar, they all have that wonderful scent when one walks through their doors. service was attentive. breakfast was very good in an attractive room. our room was big and i was thrilled to have a bathtub! all terrific. we like our window open, so sat. was a bit noisy as party revellers were winding their way home. next night was fine. great location. this hotel has gone through recent renovations and it shows!",4,2015,10,01
202,Start of a wonderful trip,"The gorgeous Dublin Westin Hotel located just a short walk from Trinity University of Dublin was just what a few tired travelers needed to rest up before a week of touring the Emerald Isle. 
    The staff at the Dublin Westin were helpful and welcoming and the room accommodations were superb! Bathrooms were spacious, clean and well lit. The beds, a travelers dream- plush and oh so cozy! The traditional, yet elegant restaurant is modernly decorated with tones of gray, teal and gold. This gem offers a wonderful buffet with specialized made to order hot items along with a Irishman's dream continental brunch buffet for those in a rush.",5,2015,09,30
202,Decent hotel,It was centrally located steps from air link bus stop from airport. Rooms were small but exceptionally clean and beds comfortable. Buffet breakfast food but pricey at 30 euros. Good entry portal to city and country.,4,2015,09,29
202,Westin stay,"The rooms were well done complete with robes.  It's right downtown and very convenient to Trinity College, Grafton St, the Liffey, and others.  The breakfast as complete as was our experience at the Doubletree, Burlington Rd.  When I got sick, the concierge was very helpful in getting a doctor to the room for only ‚Ç¨110 where a clinic would have been ‚Ç¨55 and required a wait all night.  This was a ver nice feature.",4,2015,09,27
202,Bloom off this Rose - Tour Bus groups = no upgrades and poor room avability,"This is one of the older Western properties conveniently located in central downtown Dublin.

However, this was the first time in the 7 - 8 years we have been SPG platinums that, not only did we not received any sort of minor room upgrade, we received a room with 2 small twin beds on a very low floor. We were a bit confused by this until we got to breakfast the next morning and saw it was packed to the rafters with a large tour bus group.

The problem of receiving a lower floor room is that the ""local revelers"" shout, sing and make noise until 2 or 3 in the morning. This is not conducive to a good night's sleep.

Perhaps I am somewhat snobbish after over 20 years experience with the Westin franchise,  but when they start prioritizing blocks of Tour Bus groups ahead of their Platinum members, it is time to move on.",3,2015,09,21
202,"Location, location, location",We loved the location of this hotel. We could walk to almost everything we wanted to see. It was also close to the pick up points for day trips. The staff was great as well. Our room was wonderful! It overlooked Trinity College. It was huge compared to our room in London. The only complaint was that Internet is not included in the room rates. We had to go to Starbucks but there were two close by. Overall. A great place.,5,2015,09,20
202,Wonderful Westin,"We recently stayed for a week at this exceptional hotel. The location was perfect, in the center of Dublin. The staff was helpful, knowledgeable, and friendly. The doorman, Alan, was our favorite staff member. Our room was spacious, pretty, and so comfortable. I would highly recommend this hotel to everyone staying in Dublin.",5,2015,09,19
202,Why only a Queen bed?,"Great location, close to the main places of interest and eateries. Great staff, good amenities, room a reasonable size. So why only a Queen bed for this price? Bathroom ok, but shower area very tight. And eating in will dent the wallet. Put a King bed in, enlarge the shower and it would be an absolute winner. As it is, I'm not sure that it's value for money.",3,2015,09,19
202,A Gem in Dublin,"My husband and I ended our UK holiday with 5 nights at the Westin Dublin.  I cannot begin to express what an outstanding hotel this is.  From the moment we arrived the service was fantastic.  Every staff member we encountered was so friendly, helpful and knowledgeable.  Concierge staff were excellent, especially Laszlo. Service in the restaurants was also excellent with a special call out to Emma in the Atrium Lounge.
Our room was spacious, beautiful  and very comfortable with just the right amenities. The location across from Trinity College is fantastic. This is a very special property and I highly recommend it.  We are already looking forward to our next trip there.",5,2015,09,19
202,Very nice accommodations and top service,"We stayed at one of the suites for 2 nights on a personal vacation and while the hotel is clearly a little older, it still has maintained a polished and clean atmosphere.  The suite has alot of room in the living area and bathroom, though the bedroom was of average size.  There was turndown service every evening.  The front desk staff was very attentive and focused on speed and thoroughness.  The location is great, you can walk to many of the key city sites.  I highly recommend staying here and would stay here again too.",4,2015,09,17
202,Beautiful  hotel,"Could not fault this hotel, from the friendly helpful staff, the fantastic location, to the comfort of the beds and the size of the room . A little more expensive but definitely worth it .. best hotel in Dublin by far",5,2015,09,17
202,Excellent hotel in the center of Dublin,"My daughter and I stayed for 3 nights at the Westin and loved it! The staff was helpful and friendly. We enjoyed the cucumber water in the beautifully decorated lobby and had a lovely afternoon tea in the atrium. Our room was comfortable, luxurious and the bathroom was clean and elegant. Best of all, to enjoy Dublin we just stepped out of the door and were minutes from great sights, shops and restaurants.",5,2015,09,16
202,Great Location and Service,After some hit or miss service experiences at hotels across Ireland the Westin Dublin was a breath of fresh air from check in to check out. We spent two nights there on the back end of a week long trip. Rooms are good sized and well appointed. Location can't be beat. We decided to do the afternoon tea which was lovely. No complaints!,5,2015,09,15
202,Solid hotel in center of city,"I stayed at the Westin Dublin on business in June 2015. Location in the center of Dublin is fantastic. Very close to many tourist and business locations, most of which are within walking distance. Hotel was quiet enough during the week, rooms were very large, clean and comfortable. One thing to note in the particular room I was staying in is that there was essentially no view as a high wall blocked any direct city view. All in, I would most certainly stay again here as an alternative to the Shelbourne and other hotels in the city center.",4,2015,09,15
202,Nice and Great Location,"Staff was very pleasant and accommodating; rooms clean and big, bed was heavenly after our all night flight from the U.S. Centrally located; very close to Trinity College and the Book of Kells, across the street from the Temple Bar area with restaurants and music, close walk to Grafton Street for shopping. We took the luxury air coach, blue coach, from the airport; tickets are sold where you board at the airport ground level.  7 euros one way, 12 euros round trip and they drop you off about 2 min from the hotel; down and across the street at the light from the Westin. The bus even has free internet and leaves every 10-15 minutes.",5,2015,09,14
202,Exceptional Hotel,"I can't say enough about this property. Excellent location in the city centre, across the street from Fleet Street and the Temple Bar area. Next door to Trinity College and a block from Grafton Street and some great shopping.  The hotel is also just 2 blocks from where the majority of tour groups are picked up. Everything to do in Dublin is within walking distance of the Westin. Very quite, clean and spacious rooms with outstanding beds.  Excellent service by all the staff. Largest bathroom I have ever had in a European hotel.  Don't make the mistake of staying anywhere else when in Dublin.",5,2015,09,14
202,Westin Dublin ,"The Westin in Dublin exceeded expectations. The rooms were very large , furnishings were updated , the bedding luxurious and the bathroom immaculate . After a long day of touring the shower was fabulous . The staff were very helpful and made wonderful suggestions during our three days in Dublin. The location can't be beat , very centrally located. We didn't try the hotel restaurant but it looked very nice , there is also an atrium that is lovely for tea or cocktails. 
The Westin was a perfect end to our 12 day 
Driving trip through Ireland. We were glad to garage the car at the Westin and walk around the city . ",5,2015,09,14
202,"Very Pleasant Stay, Well-Located for Touring","As an SPG member, I expected the Westin Dubin to meet Westin's general standards, but we were very pleased with our ability to check in early, with the pleasant demeanor of the staff, and with the exceptional location, just down the street from Trinity College. The public spaces are appealing. We had breakfast one morning in the dining room-- very good, and our room service breakfast another morning was fresh and on time. I'd happily return.",5,2015,09,13
202,Posh and convenient,"This particular Westin hotel is best of breed in Dublin. Beautiful throughout with friendly and professional staff, this convenient spot in this beautiful city close to favorite areas like Temple Bar will not disappoint.",5,2015,09,13
202,Fantastic Hotel,"I have to stay, this has to be the number one Westin I have ever stayed. As soon as you drive up for Valet parking, you're in their good hands. Very friendly staff and not over bearing at all. The staff is there to make your stay as pleasant as possible. The location is also fantastic. It's close to everything, whether you walk or take a taxi.  We'd certainly stay here again and again and again.",5,2015,09,13
202,awesome hotel,"this hotel is awesome.  It is clean, comfortable and is centrally located.  We visited the atrium bar area which is very comfortable and relaxing as well as the Mint Bar downstairs.  The staff was very accommodating.  This is a no brainer to stay at.",5,2015,09,10
202,lovely as always and perfect location,"we are spg members so we love the westin hotels.  the staff was so helpful and kind to me when i discovered at checkin that i had lost my wallet. horrific experience.  
great heavenly beds, restaurants and bars excellent.  the location was primo.",5,2015,09,10
202,Afternoon Tea at the Westin 10/10,"Afternoon Tea in the Atrium of the Westin was just wonderful, the room itself is bright and airy with beautiful chairs and settees to just relax and enjoy the most mouth watering pastries and sandwiches ever, there are two different menus to choose from ,a traditional one with scones and jam and cucumber sandwiches ect... or The Very Peculiar Menu which is for the more adventurous and gorgeous if you like a little more spicy food with lovely pastries to follow and all served on a slate cake stand, the staff are very attentive and not intrusive. well worth it for a special treat.",5,2015,09,10
202,Beautiful hotel in a brilliant location.,"We stayed here for a weekend visit to Dublin & it was top notch from start to finish. The doormen were super helpful. Checkin had a bit of a hitch as our rooms were not ready, however we were checking in at 2pm. We left our bags & headed to the mint bar for something to eat. The mint bar has a lovely atmosphere & fab drinks. 
We had booked 2 suites & they were both fabulous, well furnished, comfy beds, huge bathroom, lots of lighting & storage space. The hotel then delighted us by bringing a bottle of red wine & selection of cheese platter to our room, which we enjoyed whilst getting ready for the evening. 
The location of the Westin really cannot be beaten. Brilliant for shopping, tourist trips, nightlife & for all the great restaurants. Although it is a busy area the room were lovely & peaceful.
The atrium bar/ lounge was lovely for drinks & getting together at the start of the night. Breakfast was included in our stay and the food was lovely, freshly cooked & tasty.
Lastly but not least, the staff without fail were super helpful & friendly. Nothing was too much bother. 
All in all it was a great hotel to stay in & the only one we shall stay at in Dublin in future.",5,2015,09,06
202,A good sleep,"The hotel personnel are wonderful, accommodating, and full of information.  The beds are glorious.  The hotel is located perfectly to enable easy walking distance to great eating, entertaining, and historic locations.  This is the place to stay for complete luxury and convenience to tour the city.",5,2015,09,03
202,Enjoyed our stay at Westin Dublin,"I used SPG to book the Westin Dublin.  Our room was very nice. We didn't have a view but I wouldn't expect one using points to book our reservation. The hotel is really conveniently located for sightseeing.  I think what prevented me from giving it 5 stars is the service at the front desk.  Every time I had to visit the front desk, I had to wait forever to speak to someone and I wasn't the only person waiting in line.  One front desk professional was helping other guests and each time I was there, at least one other person was on the phone or just standing at the desk doing ""something"" on the computer.  Each of the times I had to wait took FOREVER.  I don't know if they are just overstaffed but I never have this issue in other Westins.  Sure, the people on the phone could have been dealing with some major issue but each time I was there?  Other than that, we really enjoyed the property.",4,2015,09,01
202,95% positive....but one complaint.,"It's seems a bit unfair of me to write a slightly critical review, because nearly everything was perfect.

I reserved a room with SPG points that I earned from travelling for work. We were assigned a room on the fifth floor. As we were celebrating our anniversary and taking a one night break from a hectic family life, we were really looking forward to a nice rest. 

Though the checkin staff were very nice and welcoming they omitted to mention that construction/refurbishment work was taking place in the room next door. This, I thought was shoddy, because if we knew this we would have chosen a different room or even a different weekend. When we asked at reception if this work would take place the following morning we were assured it would not. Unfortunately at 930 the following morning the drills and banging recommended much to our disappointment.

I wondered if we were assigned this room because it was reserved with SPG points. I hope it was not because I choose Aloft/Sheraton options where possible when I work abroad because of the excellent loyalty programme.

I understand rooms in such a nice hotel need to be maintained but just would have like a little bit more transparency from the staff we spoke with.

That said, this is a gorgeous hotel and the room we stayed in was really comfortable we loved 95% of our stay.

I would recommend this hotel but in my humble opinion rooms next to those being refurbished should not be offered.",4,2015,08,29
202,"Wonderful, Beautiful Hotel in Great Location","The Westin Dublin is a cut above the typical Westin. It's a fabulous property in a great location for shopping, working or nightlife.

The hotel itself is beautiful in every respect: the lobby, the rooms and the restaurants. My room was a two-story library suite that was spectacular with a spiral staircase connecting the two floors. Very large, very comfortable. Nice marble bath too with both a tub and a shower.

This is a clear winner and deserving of the five star review.",5,2015,08,29
202,Heavenly bed after an overnight flight,"Perfectly located next to Temple Bar and walking distance to the highlights of Dublin.  The beds are so amazingly comfortable - highly recommenced after an overnight flight.  

We also spent a night at another luxury (historic) property in Dublin, although both are lovely for different reasons, the staff at the Westin made the difference. We requested an early check-in and although we couldn't be accommodated immediately, one particular person at the front desk (Georges) made sure we felt well cared for and not just ushered away hoping for a room at some point (we all know how that feels!! I hate the ""we'll call you"")   He made a very specific point of leaving the desk and finding us in the lobby to make sure we were not left waiting.  This is what separates a nice hotel, from a place I'll consistently return to and recommend to friends.",5,2015,08,27
202,Weekend break.,"The hotel is in a good central location. Staff were friendly and helpful. We were given an room upgrade, to a library suit. The room was pleasant enough and very clean and comfortable.. The hotel bar was somewhat lacking in atmosphere and the lighting was awful. Cocktails were very good and there was good live jazz later in the evening. We were woken after midnight by a member of staff with room service, which we had not ordered. Breakfast was a big disappointment. We arrived at 10.40 on Sunday morning, aware that service was until 11am. By the time we were served our coffee we were told that the buffet was about to be cleared away so could we help ourselves straight away. The smoothies were all finished and the bread selection was poor. There were no mushrooms or tomatoes left for the hot breakfast and barely enough scrambled egg for one portion. If breakfast is served until 11am then it should be the same experience for anyone taking it at 7am.",3,2015,08,24
202,"Beautiful hotel, central location","We spent 5 nights at this hotel. Overall the staff are wonderful, outgoing, and friendly. The breakfast is quite good from both a food quality and service perspective.  We did not go to the Atrium lounge but did go to the Mint bar.  The service at the Mint bar is quite spotty. They lost our food order despite it being slow on one occasion and then on another occasion took our drink order but did not deliver the drinks until we placed it a second time.

As a SPG Platinum member we asked for an upgrade. We did get a small suite but emphasis on small.

It is a great spot for touring and culture. Most places are in easy walking distance.",4,2015,08,24
202,Trying to be pretentious and charging for it but not really there.,"Booking a hotel over a long weekend was never going to be easy and the company is paying but even I took in a suck of air when I saw the prices, but with nothing else around, 160+ Euro a night was going to be it I am afraid.

In the center of Dublin it is easy walk to the Dart on Tara street and to the bars and restaurants of Temple bar, the centre is easily in reach with access to all you need from that. Inside the hotel the staff are attentive and nice to work with. The room is clean and nice and the Wifi works a treat, a usual let down in normal chain hotels. Finish of the room needs a bit of work but that is up to the maintenance team.

If you are not prepared to throw another wad of cash on the table for the not included all day breakfast (starts late at 7am) typical Irish breakfasts are available all over Dublin for a few Euros. I did not try their breakfast it started too late for me.

Their loyalty program is messy and not great but that is another story.",3,2015,08,23
202,Best Of Westin,"From Allen the doorman to the front desk, the service here is the best of Westin. Nice room in great location, enjoyed the A/C! Allen gave us great directions as was most friendly and funny! In the bar, my friend needed some ice for his knee. There is not ice available on the floors. The staff at the bar went above and beyond  and vacuum sealed a pack of ice that was perfect. We had a minor issue with the taxi to the airport overcharging us. The front desk was all over it and issued us a quick refund. THE place to stay in Dublin",5,2015,08,23
202,Clean and quiet; great atmosphere,"Overall very satisfied with the hotel.  The staff were very cordial and helpful, even if not able to give the very personal attention you might get at a small or boutique hotel.  Centrally located, yet still quiet, and very nice amenities - the bars and common areas in particular were exceptional and decorated in a way that evoked Dublin charm.  The room was very spacious by European standards, with a large bathroom as well, and very clean.",4,2015,08,21
202,Amazing location,"We stayed here at the end of our fantastic tour around Ireland, when we first arrived a few weeks previously  we had stayed at the Intercontinental so thought it would be interesting to compare and know in the future when we return to Dublin which hotel we would stay at again since our son has a new Irish wife and are moving there later in the year.   The location of the Westin was fantastic , we could walk every where and loved the fact that it was next door to Trinity college. The doorman and concierge too were just the best anyone could ask for. The comforts of both hotels were much of a muchness.  However the breakfast and especially the service at breakfast was way superior at the Intercontinental . The final verdict for us though is that we would stay at the Westin because of the location and not worry too much about the average service for breakfast :)",5,2015,08,19
202,Awesome hotel. Walk to so many things!,"Stayed 3 nights. Super comfy beds , spacious rooms.  Clean.  Quiet. Nice staff. Great breakfast.  Good gluten free bread at breakfast. Great coffee. Highly recommend. Great tub. Nice oasis from city life. Next to trinity college and temple bar.  Highly recommend. 
",5,2015,08,18
202,Solid and convenient hotel,"Front desk team was extremely helpful and welcoming.  Took care of everything I needed with a smile.  Personal care in getting me up and out for my early flight to London.  Room was very nice, bathroom was spacious and has nice amenities.  Breakfast was very good and the bar was a fun place to hangout before heading out for the night. ",5,2015,08,16
202,fantastic property,"This is an excellent hotel in every respect.  The location is good (almost on the grounds of Trinity College), the public areas are wonderful, the room was spacious and clean and the staff was friendly and extremely helpful.  The hotel is obviously well-maintained (the paint in the elevator was still glossy).  The bar has a great drinks list too.",5,2015,08,14
202,"very clean, super comfortable beds but carpet in the room and fridge doesn't work","I stayed for 2 nights at the Westin Dublin it is well located for a first time tourist and offers good services for business travellers (iron, ironing board). The beads are VERY comfortable.The room had carpet and the fridge did not work at all; the water bottles left on the furniture were cooler than the ones in the fridge. I asked twice about the broken fridge but nothing was done. I guess all their fridges are old and need to be replaced  so they tell clients they will send an ""engineer"" but in reality, nothing is done. They give you 2 complimentary bottles of water everyday and the rooms are quiet. The bathroom is big but the shower door makes it hard to enter the shower without having it scraping you as you try to get into the shower (part I disliked), there might be a technique to get into the shower but I did not find it! Breakfast is expensive, but very good and you can get eggs on demand but make sure your type of egg is included in the package breakfast otherwise you might end up with an extra charge, for example Benedictine eggs are not included. There is a little machine to make your own small pancakes and there is a pot of what they call maple syrup, which is NOT! It is Corn syrup with a maple flavour. You can have a loose leave tea at no extra charge, which is a plus ion my opinion and orange juice is freshly squeezed. I also had tea (tea time) and will discuss about it in another review). I do not recommend the tea time experience for traditional tea.",4,2015,08,14
202,Best place to stay!!,This hotel was amazing!!!! I cannot say enough great things about this hotel. The lobby is so welcoming and the place is just beautiful. It is in the best location with everything within walking distance. We went to Temple Bar and it took maybe 5 minutes to get there. The rooms are large and the bathrooms are huge. The beds are so comfortable and they even have plugs for whatever country you are traveling from. On top of all that they brought free wine and cheese to us just for being an SPG member. I would stay here again in a heart beat! Best hotel in Dublin!!!,5,2015,08,13
202,"Great location, great staff","We spent five days in Dublin and the centrally located hotel made it great. The basement bar was good, the pints and bar food were good and reasonably priced. The room was wonderful, clean and large. We would definitely stay there again.",5,2015,08,12
202,Perfect Spot in the Heart of Dublin,"I am guilty of not writing about places we've stayed, but I was looking at pictures this morning of our stay in Dublin and thought, I should write a review, because our stay at the Westin Dublin made our stay in this beautiful city. 

The location is perfect... almost next door to Trinity College, walking distance to almost everything else. It made our short visit effortless and fun. 

The hotel itself is wonderful... all of the amenities you would expect of a Westin branded hotel but tons of history character, which you often lose with chain hotels. We stained in one of the famous writer's rooms (can't remember which one!). It was fantastic! A two story affair, with the bedroom and bathroom on the lower level and a winding staircase leading up to the library/tv room! Amazing!

The Heavenly Beds as always were heavenly, as was the service. Every staff member we met went out of their way to greet us warmly and ensure we were having a nice stay. 

We didn't eat in the hotel - except for a yummy afternoon tea in the atrium area which was very good. 

Without a doubt I would recommend this hotel for anyone looking for the perfect spot in Dublin.",5,2015,08,12
202,A Very Special Afternoon Tea,Great spot for tea when shopping or a drink before/after the theatre.  Try the Most Peculiar Afternoon Tea in The Atrium Lounge which includes a pot of Hendrick's Gin Cocktail! Food is yummy too and is beautifully presented. Have brought visitors here on several occasions and they have not been disappointed.  It is a very relaxing experience away from the hustle and bustle of the city outside.,5,2015,08,12
202,"Great location, staff are terrible","We were so excited to stay at the hotel as I had read about the special suite rooms with 2 floors and was super excited. 

The rooms had 2 floors but the way it is set up it is not easy to live in. If your partner watches tv in the lounge upstairs the noise carries downstairs. Its pretty but not ideal. Its a nice room but I would rather book the normal room for the price.

The doormen and concierge service are awesome! They are friendly and welcoming and the only staff in the hotel i can really give a 5 star rating. 

The remainder of the staff  - I checked in by a certain staff member and I spoke to them a few times during our 5 day stay. They never remembered me once! They did not explain how the breakfast works. I was told it was included at check in and when i went to breakfast i was told i had to pay for eggs. Therefore i did not have breakfast at the hotel. I went to the other restaurants on Temble bar. Upon check out i was told the eggs WERE INCLUDED. AS I AM A PLATINUM MEMBER. ANNOYED IS AN UNDERSTATEMENT! All i got was a sorry for the misunderstanding...

The staff seem do too many things and don't focus on one job. The gent seemed to be at reception then taking luggage upstairs to the rooms. 

The location is amazing! It is literally across the road from all the bars and the shops.

I recommend the hotel for the location.",3,2015,08,12
202,"Centrally located, large rooms, great staff!","I can't say enough about the central location of this hotel.  I walked everywhere - even the ~2 miles to the Guinness Factory which was about the farthest point of all major site-seeing.  The hotel is next to Trinity College, less than 2 blocks from the beginning of Grafton St (higher end shopping), across the street from the lively Temple Bar area, and across the river from more shopping.  

I stayed at this hotel for two weeks and had no issues.  The staff is incredibly lovely, especially Moe!  The ""hello's"", ""good morning/evening"" were very genuine from all who would greet me and my colleagues.  The Mint Bar, which I frequented for dinner, was always wonderful and it was the food that drew me back time and again.

Now, a few notes about the rooms - the rooms are all slightly different (shapes and size) and the major difference was in the bathroom.  I had a very small (say 5'x5') standing shower that was small for me (5'4"", 120 lbs).  However, one of my colleagues had a shower/bathtub combo that was quite large and my other colleague had a larger standing shower than I did (more like 5' x 7').  All of our bathrooms had a nice, large bathtub and were otherwise pretty roomy as well.  Also, some rooms have and adjoining door and one night I could hear my neighbors TV quite well (it was loud) and the rest of the nights I didn't hear a peep through the doors.  If you are a light sleeper, request a room that does not have an adjoining door to be safe.  Also, the rooms with the larger shower seem to end with ""12"".  

Lastly, they offer a green program so if you opt out of having your room cleaned, you can earn 500 points, but you have to hang the green (something) hanger on your door.  The ""hanger"" was on the nightstand and not obvious to meet until after a couple of nights.

Overall, this was a very pleasant place to stay!",4,2015,08,10
202,Enjoyable stay in the heart of the city,"Basically, it is what you would expect from the Westin in this category. The only surprise - the design is more classic than that of a typical hotel under this brand. The location is very convenient if you like to take a stroll around the Old Town.",4,2015,08,08
202,"Beautiful hotel, perfect location","As every other review mentions, the location of the Westin Dublin is absolutely perfect. Dublin is a very walkable city, and the Westin is a great home base for exploring everywhere.

It's also a legitimate five-star, service-oriented hotel, and Americans will feel especially comfortable (as long as you don't mind being surrounded by other Americans!). The rooms had at least one American-style 240v outlet (no adapter needed), and an American 115v outlet in the bathroom for shavers. Bathrooms are spacious, elegant and modern, and you can't find a more luxurious bed.

We didn't eat much there, as there are hundreds of great choices within an easy walk. The Mint bar is a really interesting and relaxing place to grab a drink, although predictably overpriced. And the Atrium lounge is peaceful and a great place to rest after a walk.

Bottom line: you just can't get much better than this. If you want to explore Dublin at your own pace, the Westin is the best choice.",5,2015,08,04
202,Great spot in Dublin,"Stayed here for a few days at the beginning and end of a trip to Ireland.  The hotel is in a great spot, right across the street from the Temple Bar.  As with most Westin's the hotel was great, super beds and the staff was fantastic!  I would absolutely stay here again.",5,2015,08,02
202,Excellent location - one of the best hotels in Dublin,"The Westin has an exceptional location opposite Temple Bar - there is no better located hotel for a first time visitor to explore the great city of Dublin. The hotel occupies the site of an old bank and so the layout is not typical of many hotels adding some great character. The mint bar make good cocktails, and often have live Michael Bubble-esque entertainment on weekend evenings. The writers rooms on the 5th floor with private balconies are excellent and in general the rooms are top notch if on occasion on the dark side. There are a large number of suites available although I would advise SPG platinums hoping for upgrades to book the class of room they want, this is a very busy hotel. Furnishings are typical of Westin's worldwide although this is in my experience a too quality Westin. The staff are friendly and happy to help whenever possible - taking the effort to remember and great regulars. My only criticisms of the hotel are food service in the mint bar can be slow (and the restaurant as of late has not been serving evening food) and the gym is while passable inadequate for the size and class of hotel. Would be my go to hotel for future Dublin trips. ",5,2015,08,02
202,"Excellent location close to numerous attractions and restaurants, very attentive staff","We spent a week there in a couple of different rooms (Classic room and a Terrace room) and it was very enjoyable.  Phenomenal Location!!!  You are close to Templebar which has a larger number of restaurants, pubs and bars, and a lot of live music playing in the bars and on the street.  While the street near the Westin was busy we were not bothered by night time party noise which starts  a little ways away. The beds were comfortable and there were different thickness pillows to choose from.   The one downside was the shower stall in the classic room and the more upscale room were identical and just a little on the small side as it was just barely big enough.  The breakfast buffet was good.  The concierge was helpful for booking tickets.  All the staff we interacted with were friendly and helpful.  The gym was good as it had 3 treadmills.  One other downside is the bathrooms have the standard worldwide Westin little trashcan which is difficult to use, as its suppose to be foot operated but it is too small and tips over easy or bangs on the tile.",4,2015,08,01
202,Very nice hotel,"Very nice hotel, great location in the city centre, just beside Trinity College, Temple Bar, and Grafton Street for shopping, nightlife, pubs, and sightseeing.  The hotel staff was nice.  They didn't have the room type that we needed when we arrived so the front desk agent upgraded our room to help accommodate our needs, with a moderate upgrade charge.",4,2015,07,31
202,Vacation ,The Westin was a wonderful experience for our first stop in Ireland. Nice sized rooms and very centrally located to Trinity college and the Guinness Store house! The breakfast was included but the food was so so. The staff was very friendly and helpful! They recommended restaurants and pubs which were never disappointing!,4,2015,07,28
202,Good hotel in a good location,"Lovely hotel with impressive atrium upstairs where they serve afternoon tea and snacks etc. Formerly a bank. Excellent food and lovely rooms. Just a shame that, because of it's location there is no parking so you have to park across the road in Fleet Street car park. Not sure if they do valet parking although I suspect that they don't. Don't particularly like the street it's on either but it is just a minutes' walk away from Trinity College!",4,2015,07,26
202,Quality hotel in a good location,"Solid construction, good location, good breakfast make this a reasonable destination for business and leisure travelers.  The hotel has a very large inside courtyard which many of the rooms face.  This certainly means the rooms are quite but they lack any view or sunlight.",4,2015,07,25
202,A great choice of hotel for Dublin,"The Westin in Dublin is great. It is in a central location with most things within walking distance. All of the staff were great, from the reception, to concierge, drinks and dining teams and room service. 

The quality of the hotel is very good, and exceptionally clean. 

The food is good in the main restaurant, The Mint, as well as on the mezzanine floor and breakfast ( although the pancakes were a disappointment - but even the handling of the situation by the manager was first class ).

We are fussy about hotels, but this is one we would use again.",5,2015,07,25
202,Great Hotel in a Great Location,"Spent my first two nights in Ireland at the Westin and loved it. The hotel was a bank and the beautiful and ornate public areas are lovely.  Especially liked the Mint Bar - which was where the vault used to be. Great atmosphere and great food at the Mint.  The rooms are really nice and well appointed. Although there was no real view from my room. I had a balcony and it had a high wall that I could not see over. Weird. The room was a junior suite with large and comfortable bed in a separate room. A nice sitting area and plenty of room. The room was spotlessly clean and the service was excellent. Breakfast was very good, and they also serve afternoon tea in the atrium - although I did not partake. I liked the neighborhood - so close to trinity College and close to everything. A great stay.",5,2015,07,24
202,Super cool hotel,"Loved this place, location was awesome. Rooms were huge and so comfortable. Bathrooms were big.  We had a junior suite which was amazing. We liked the little bar downstairs, lobby easy to maneuver. Can't say enough good things about this place.  We were only there for one night as we were catching a flight back to the states the next day, but would have loved to have spent 2 or 3 nights here.  If we are ever in Dublin again we wil for sure stay here.",5,2015,07,24
202,User friendly hotel in a great loction,"Excellent service from checkin to departure. Friendly & helpful staff. 
Room was good &'as requested by us. Location ideal for sightseeing. Room amenities as per standard 5 star. Basement restaurant friendly with good food. Very nice atrium
restaurant for light food. Liked everything!",5,2015,07,23
202,Beautiful hotel,This hotel is in a great location and makes it an easy walk to different attractions. It was directly across from Trinity College.If you get a chance make a reservation for High Tea. Amazing amount of food and very delicious. The bar downstairs is a great place to grab a late bite to eat. There is construction going down on the street. So take that into consideration when booking a room. You also have to pay for wifi connection if you are not a rewards member!!!,4,2015,07,23
202,Centrally located excellent Hotel with superior service,This hotel is almost directly across from Trinity College in a down town trendy part of Dublin. It is very well maintained. The rooms are small to medium in size and the beds are perfect. It is quiet and very lovely. The food is lovely. I though the price was not just appropriate but a bargain for the luxury. The decor is very nice. I will go out of my way to stay here again.,5,2015,07,22
202,Home Away from Home,"The Westin is such a cute hotel and is super fancy on the inside. My mom and I got a room with two cozy beds and the bathroom was big enough to live in with a separate shower and a jacuzzi like bathtub. I slept like a baby in my own bed and wished I could bring both the shower and tub home with me. 

The service is super friendly, the bellman would always brighten upon seeing my mom and I when we got back from exploring and they all have tags with their names and passions on them to encourage conversations. 

The breakfast in the morning is amazing. It's buffet style (you can order off of a menu as well if you like) where you can get delicious Irish bacon, eggs, button mushrooms (a huge staple diet in Ireland and are super tasty); and also has a variety of breads and fruits and fresh yogurts as well. You don't leave hungry! 

The hotel is also conveniently near Temple Bar and Trinity College so you can go out and have a pint or some pub food or go over to the college to check out the Book of Kells. Great location, great people, great rooms, and great service. Highly recommend!",5,2015,07,21
202,I'd book it again.,"Staff, location, decor - everything was just right.  I had ordered flowers ahead of time and it was one of the best bouquets I've ever seen, anywhere.  This is going to be a somewhat boring review because it met my high expectations - no better endorsement than that.  Two minor things - not the quietest of rooms, I could hear people in the hall/other rooms.  And if you valet parked your car - give yourself ample time for the car to be brought up (double their recommendation).",4,2015,07,20
202,Position.,"We have been visited by two sets of cousins from the United States this year and on both occasions we have all stayed at the Westin. The hotel is excellent with the very nicest staff from the front door in, food and bar services excellent, but this is about LOCATION. Right in the middle of Dublin, out the front, turn left, cross the street and you are in Trinity, The Book of Kells ect. Cross the street again and up to the shops and street artists, don't forget to turn left and visit the shops at the back of Trinity. Fantastic city.",5,2015,07,18
202,Wonderful hotel ,"In the heart of the city. Great rooms been placed on the 5th floor, pretty spacious rooms, very friendly staff, nice variety of room service menu. Been recommended by a few colleagues who stay here regularly m, really thankful for the suggestion. Only suggestion is to improve the wifi service as the signal kept dropping. Otherwise wonderful and would happily recommend. ",5,2015,07,17
202,"Amazing location, great service","Fantastic location, within walking distance to many of Dublin's sights.  Definitely better than your average Westin.  Super helpful staff that went out of their way for us.  Traveled with my husband and our 2 teenagers so we had 2 rooms, both of which were spacious and clean.  Dined in the Vault and had a great meal.  Absolutely would recommend this property.",5,2015,07,15
202,"Location, location, location....","The Westin Dublin was our first stop of our 5 day tour of Ireland...and what a great decision that was!!! Right from the moment of the valet parking to the check out time we had nothing but the best in service.

The hotel is located within hopping distance of Temple Bar and within strolling distance of all the major attractions. The rooms are clean, very well equipped with quality toiletries and amenities and the service is great on all aspects of the brand. 

As an SPG member I was not disappointed.

Five star service...albeit at a five star price but certainly money well spent. 

Downside - a little tricky to find but what hotel isn't in any CBD in any part of the world!!!! 

",5,2015,07,14
202,Conveniently situated and very nice,"Situated just across the street from Trinity University, this hotel is perfect for a visit to the Book of Kells. The hotel is an old bank and its bar is in the vault! Our nicely appointed top floor room offered a great view of Trinity. The breakfast offering was truly outstanding. A very quiet hotel.",5,2015,07,12
202,"A really nice stay, but","We really enjoyed our stay here. The staff was excellent/location is great. The reason I did not give it a 5 star is that when I made the reservations through SPG the rate included breakfast. When we got the confirmation it was not included. In subsequent contacts they told SPG they would take care of it but when talking to me they would not honor that. Think it probably had to do with my using SPG points rather than ""paying"" for rooms. Again a nice property, but will probably quit collecting SPG points and switch my loyalty to another brand if that is what happens when I actually want to use the points.",4,2015,07,11
202,"Great Location, small rooms","We are loyal spg members.  Thought this would be a perfect spot, and it was for location, but the room size was a bit small, but large bathroom.
the biggest disappointment was that the wireless was terrible, could not get reception in the room, so for business, it was a bummer.  The breakfasts were very nice, the staff was very good, especially Ross and Lazlo, the concierges....",3,2015,07,10
202,"Perfect Location, Good Hotel","This hotel is close to most of the main attractions and allows you to walk to most places.  The staff is friendly and helpful.  We had a room on the 2nd floor and you could definitely hear noise from outside.  The room was small but spacious and the bathroom was amazing with the exception that it had no outlets.  The wifi was extremely weak in the room and the management did their absolute best to remedy this but we all know wifi doesn't spread out evenly in structions.  I was not a big fan of the breakfast buffet (it is moved to the Mint Bar while they renovate the main restaurant).  Seemed like they were always out of what I wanted, the pancake machine was broken, and the staff never seemed to ""see"" us when we needed them.   I can say everyone was always so helpful and nice and when you did ask for assistancec they did everything they could.  Apparently Sundays they clean rooms until 6pm so if you want to be able to come home around 4 and use your room, you need to ask  them to clean it.  I would stay here again.",4,2015,07,09
202,Great Location - NOTHING is free,"We stayed at the a different hotel  the  night before, and it was 120 Euro Cheaper, breakfast included and free wi-fi.
The room was very small for the price, and when we asked for a King bed instead, they said they would charge us an additional 25Euro - not much, but out of principle we declined. 
The rooms were very clean, but with the bathroom, there was one bar of soap and no shampoo or anything else. when we asked, they said it would be a cost for SHAMPOO!!
Location was PERFECT, but we just felt like we were ripped off - especially for the nickle and dimming for things that you would expect from a 5 Star hotel to be included.",3,2015,07,09
202,Small rooms,"I want to start off with the good first and that would be the staff, accommodating and very professional.....I had questions about where to go and they had the answers , very helpful in that aspect....The food was terrible at the hotel,the breakfast bland and the high tea the worst I had ever had, the scones we absolutely dreadful,no flavor at all....the hotel is at the center of everything which is good!! The rooms were very tiny,I had tried to upgrade however they were fully committed(Starwood Preferred)If you want an Irish experience, do not stay there, the hotel was full of Americans, 90%......The lobby was quite beautiful but the rooms disappointing the only plus here was the staff they were very accommodating!!",3,2015,07,09
202,Great hotel in city centre,"I stayed with my mother and sister for a night. It was a great hotel. There were a number of people in training when we were there but the service was still efficient and courteous. We ordered a triple room for our ""girls break"" but a trundle wasn't available so we were given a complimentary Queen Room. It was nice to have the Queen but it was disappointing to not be together. The rooms were a good size and the beds were very comfortable. We had a break in the bar area where I had a hot chocolate that was lovely and my sister had the tea and scones. There was a good breakfast buffet in the morning. No free wifi which was disappointing. Great location though very close to the castle, river and Temple Bar area.",5,2015,07,07
202,Beautiful old hotel,"We were privileged to stay here in Dublin.  Extremely helpful service and incredibly beautiful old hotel.  It was a bit difficult to get to as traffic in Dublin is quite hairy with all the construction and one way streets, but well worth it when we got there.  They fortunately had valet parking with great bellmen.  The breakfast was quite good also.  The rooms were well appointed and elegant.  This was the only place we visited in Ireland that did not provide free wifi, which was a bit of a disappointment.",4,2015,07,07
202,"Ideal location, solid hotel","Very helpful staff and enjoyed the wonderful location.  I was lucky to be upgraded to one of their suites - great space, comfortable room and huge bathroom.  My only real issue is the restaurant offers a pretty simple breakfast for way too much money.  I've been to hotels with less stars with better breakfasts and service.",4,2015,07,06
202,Nice hotel,"Visited recently and hotel is situated in the heart of Dublin. Really nice facilities and whilst we had a slight issue upon arrival, it was quickly dealt with in a very professional manner. Food drinks are good value for money and the service is first class, all in all a very pleasant stay. Would definitely revisit",4,2015,07,05
202,"Very Good Hotel, Great Location","This hotel is next to Trinity College and within walking distance of lots of Dublin attractions. I really think the location can't be beat. Everyone was very friendly and accommodating. The room was pretty decent size as far as European standards go and it had everything you might need including a large, well equipped bathroom. I would definitely stay here again. ",5,2015,07,05
202,Excellent hotel in perfect location!,"Visited in early July - this is an excellent hotel in a perfect location for tourists.  

The hotel is right next door to Trinity College and minutes (walking distance) to many tourist sites.  In the evening, Temple Bar (the area) is 1 block away. We went to see Riverdance -- the theater is about 10 minutes walk.

The full Irish breakfast is ok - I wouldn't pay for it but I get it free as a Platinum member. If you are booking with points, try to book as early as possible as the rates went up when I wanted to add a night about 1 week prior.

The service was good all around.  No real complaints.

As usual, I slept very well in their Westin beds!",5,2015,07,04
202,Excellent upscale hotel in center of town,"Great service and location is excellent. Right in heart of town, nearby to River Liffey, Temple Bar area and Trinity College.

Not my first stay at the chain, although first time in Dublin. Service did not disappoint, various members of staff were always friendly and helpful when trying to  to find a place to eat or point you towards sight seeing locations.

Recommended!",5,2015,07,04
202,The Westin has thought of everything.,"From the wonderful attentive ""Mo"" (Bellman extraordinaire) who charmed us all and missed nothing, to the rooms with every plug or adapter needed we were very comfortable. Our room looked out over Trinity College rooftops and came with an entertaining seagull who visited sometimes. :) The room was very romantic with speakers for music in all the rooms. The marble in the bath was lovely and getting around the city was so perfect from this location.",5,2015,07,03
202,"Excellent Location, Service, and Experience","Our first European stop from the US,  this hotel was the place to stay to regain our bearings.  The deluxe room gave us room and a very comfortable bed.  The staff went out of their way to ensure our comfort, and provided top notch service. The hotel was in the heart of Dublin, walking distance to many attractions including pubs,  a good park for the little one, shopping,  and tour offices.  A downside is the refrigerator that is only a minibar (remove something and you are automatically charged,  can't store milk for the little one).  However,  I've become accustomed to this from the high end hotels (you can always order room service 24/7).",5,2015,07,03
202,Beautiful Hotel with charm of a Bed & Breakfast,"Hotel is located in the heart of Dublin.  Easy walking distance to historic distilleries and majestic cathedrals.  Wonderful city, wonderful sites and spectacular people! Train Station within a mile and a pub on every corner that promises great food and hospitality.  Make sure to buy the hop-on-hop-off bus ticket for under 20 American Dollars. This is a great bargain, especially in the rain--prepare for a light mist everyday during the summer season. Don't forget your umbrellas! Spectacular City!",5,2015,07,02
202,"Great location, wonderful staff!","Our family of 8 recently spent 3 nights at the Westin Dublin, a beautiful hotel in the heart of the city. It is near the Liffey, Trinity College, Temple Bar, St. Stephen's Green, on and on. Having just experienced excellent service at the Intercontinental in London, I was surprised and extremely pleased to find that the Westin staff was equally helpful and accommodating. From doormen to front desk to housekeeping, everyone was terrific! My only negative about the hotel would be lack of drawer space and, though spacious, a very difficult- to-get-into closet.",5,2015,07,01
202,Fabulous hotel in the heart of Dublin,"This hotel was fresh, modern, welcoming, with fun touches (The building was originally a bank) like a bar called the ""vault"".

202,"Perfect location, luxurious hotel","I am a platinum level Starwood member and this is one of my favorite Westin hotels. The hotel is not only luxurious but in a fantastic location to the Temple Bar district, Trinity College, and exploring the rest of the city.

202,Fabulous location and service,"We arrived in Dublin June 24 and left the 27th. What a great place. The service is top notch and you couldn't ask for a better location! Trinity college is literally across one street and Temple Bar area and literally across the other street. You can see all of Dublin without having to use much transportation if you've good walking shoes. If you do decide to use the hop on- hop off  buses, they are within a block to catch from the hotel.
The security feature of having to use your room key to access room floors is an added security bonus.",5,2015,06,30

suites are fantastic, we got upgraded from library suite to deluxe suite and hotel staff is very accommodating, breakfast spread is mind-boggling, atrium bar is out of the world!!

in all, best choice for dublin city...",5,2015,06,27
202,More like 3 stars than 4....not the best Westin.,"After a positive experience at the Westin in Paris, I was looking forward to staying at the Westin Dublin. What a disappointment! The woman at reception on check-in was off-hand and dismissive of my request to upgrade to a room with a queen (or at least a double) bed. ""You have a large 3/4 bed"" she advised with a sneer. In spite of my travel agent having made the reservation last year, there were no other rooms available - or so Ms Frosty said. The room was big enough and the bathroom roomy with a walk in shower. The view over parked buses was unappealing and being on the first floor was open to the noise of passing drunks.  Unlike most international hotels, the restaurant was not open for dinner, nor was the Atrium, the only place to have a meal being the Mint bar in the cellar. The lamb burger was almost inedible. Wi-Fi is free if you join the hotel's loyalty program so make sure you do and check that you are not charged. I attempted to ask reception and the concierge four times to confirm my chauffeur reservation to the airport - they finally got it right! Breakfast was OK but we had to clear the tables ourselves to make room for coffee, toast etc. The location of this hotel is good - handy to the main shopping area around Grafton Street and to the theatres north of the Liffey. I asked the concierge if they had any information about Bloomsday, one of Dublin's main events, but he looked at me as if i was speaking a foreign language. Perhaps I was. Only one person, an Indian man, at reception and the concierge on duty on my last day were helpful. Stay somewhere else if you are looking for a Dublin experience.",3,2015,06,27
202,Just get's better and better,"I was in Dublin with my wife for her 40th birthday. We decided to try one of the rooms with a terrace this time. It was amazing. Lot of space on the terrace, great view yet high enough that we barely heard the traffic below. The room was super comfortable as always. The staff were incredibly friendly and accomodating and really went the extra mile to make this stay special. I can't wait to visit again.",5,2015,06,26
202,"Great location, maybe worth the price but not certainly","You cant beat the location of the Westin, right next to Trinity University, a couple blocks to the pubs of Temple Bar or Grafton Street, 1 block to the river.  easy to walk all over Dublin from this as your base.  But inexpensive it is not.  Breakfast is very good - was included in our room rate, so not sure what the a la carte price would be if not included.  Wifi was not included in standard room rate - which these days and at their room rates seems crazy.  But again - location is excellent.  Service staff at the front desk and concierge seemed to be better on the day shift than the night shift.",4,2015,06,25
202,Excellent - unless you are a smoker,"Excellent hotel, beautifully decorated rooms, great comfortable bedding, convenient location, absolutely extraordinary staff, but why, oh why, must they treat smokers like lepers?  Although I accept the almost universal aversion to smoking, I would think a property of this size could designate a little corner somewhere safe for those of us who still smoke.  As an older female and obvious tourist I found it quite off-putting to have to go out onto the busy street in front of the hotel to smoke especially at night. My rating would have been 5 stars except for the smoking issue.",4,2015,06,25
202,The best place to stay in Dublin,"The hotel is wonderful and I would highly recommend a stay there. The location could not be any better, located by the Temple Bar area but was still quiet. The rooms are large and well appointed. The bathroom was huge. The atrium is beautiful and the food was very good. I will stay there again for sure.",5,2015,06,25
202,"An interesting amalgamation of old buildings-turned hotel, with a nice atrium level and lovely ""vault"" area bar","The staff was very gracious, the Mint Bar was really lovely (with some interesting drink choices), and the location is very good (across the street from Trinity College). The only slightly downside was the room location (we unfortunately ended up facing an office building), and the fact that we could never get the A/C cold enough to be able to sleep under the European-type coverlets that are often found on beds. When hotels do not allow you to open the windows (it was plenty cold enough OUTSIDE!) to try to cool down the room, there is not much of an option to sleep comfortably when there is no ""just sheet alone"" option. Otherwise",4,2015,06,24
202,Good location!,"We had a room on the top floor, nice view and comfortable bed. Good location, mins of walk away from everything. Check-in was pleasant staff were attentive. Nice room with everything needed, especially wall sockets for charging all the gadgets.",5,2015,06,23
202,"Excellent stay at the Westin, with a top-notch guide, Brian O'Reilly","This is a wonderful, first class hotel, but want made me give it five stars is my experience with driver Brian O'Reilly. I want to thank the Westin Dublin for connecting me and my family with driver and guide extraordinaire Brian O'Reilly. We had a tough problem - we needed to get to, and find, the ruins of an old castle (with a connection to our family) located on private land outside of Dundalk. Brian not only welcomed the challenge, but joined in the fun, and helped us make memorable connections with locals who steered us to our destination. He had a wealth of information about other spots to visit in Dublin, useful advice on how to beat the crowds at some landmarks, and was a pleasure to spend time with. We enjoyed him so much we booked him again for the next day, for a trip to the Passage Tomb at Newgrange. 
The staff at the Westin was universally helpful, from booking restaurant reservations, to giving directions.",5,2015,06,22
202,Fabulous Location!,"I loved this hotel, I have to say that I hesitated about booking it just because I wanted to try something al little different and local, but I can tell you I'm sure glad I went with the Westin because knowing what you're going to get after a 15 hour plane trip is fabulous! We took a cab to the Westin from Dublin airport and were there in about 25 mins (30 Euro with tip). Got a nice king size room with a heavenly bed. AC was perfect kept us cool without being too noisy and windows opened. Our room was right on the main street but the windows were great, hardly heard anything. The location of this hotel is the best you'll find, right across the street from Temple Bar and walking distance to everything. We never took a cab while we were in the city. We stayed at the Parker on our way out and while I loved the Parker, the Westin has it beat on location. We had dinner at The Winding Stair (recommended by Concierge) which sometimes doesn't always mean the best restaurant but this one was right on the money. We explored the Trinity College area, O'Connell Street, Grafton and the rest of the City. We also went to the Bank around the corner which was a little more casual than I thought but amazing building and architecture, a little noisy but staff was very nice. We also ate at the Elephant and Castle in Temple Bar which was fine, very casual. We didn't get to eat at the Exchange but heard great things about it, and their bar The Mint was amazing, really good drinks and a great atmosphere.

The only negative thing about the Westin is they want to charge for Wifi. Just step in up and offer free wifi like everywhere else or build it into the cost of the room, just seems cheap to me.",5,2015,06,22
202,Would not change a thing!,"This hotel is one of the best Westin's I have stayed in, and I travel for work often. The location is perfect for anything you want to do in Dublin. Staff is so friendly and accomodating. Rooms are beautiful, clean and updated. So thankful for this beautiful hotel on a long vacation!",5,2015,06,21
202,Great location and great staff!,"Whenever we go to Dublin, we always stay at the Westin. Not only is it a wonderful property with the most comfy beds, but it is in the heart of all the action. Cross the street from Temple Bar, down the street from Grafton shops, next to Trinity College - what more can you ask for! The concierge staff is always ready with a pub recommendation or to help book a tour. Thanks for making our stay a great one!",3,2015,06,18
202,Westin - Dublin,"Want to get away?  Something different from the beach or mtn cabin?  Just spent a long weekend in Dublin.  A great and memorable experience.
The Westin Hotel is in the perfect location within walking distance of everything important, great pubs, great restaurants, great shopping.
Want to get outside the city center and see life in Ireland? Try Brian O'Reilly's Corporate Taxi Service.  A wonderful guy, made us feel safe and comfortable, knows the country and can take you to see the sights, even the places you didnt know about.  Awesome sevice.
Ir",5,2015,06,17
202,A good location,We enjoyed our stay overall.  The pillows were the best from our trip.  The only thing I caution you about is to make sure and ask for a room not facing the main street.  You will definitely get late night noise from the street.  The service was good.  And the central location was excellent.,4,2015,06,15
202,Fantastic location & Staff,"Situated ideally near Dublin nightlife, this gem continues to deliver consistently excellent service.  Ross and Simon are among the sharpest concierges I have ever encountered.  Additionally should you need a private guide, please insist, not ask, but insist on Brian O'Reilly...he is supreme in knowledge of all Ireland",5,2015,06,14
202,Great location,"My selection of this place was because of me being an SPG member and wanted to collect points. I was pleasantly surprised at its location and the friendly staff.

The only request I have is that it would be great to have lamp on the reading/writing desk.",4,2015,06,14
202,Great location and ambiance,Nice property with charm situated in the hear of Dublin nearby food and the beatiful university. The service is good and friendly and the rooms are well appointed. It would benefit from more dining options - an outdoor seating area during summer would be great.,4,2015,06,12
202,Saved by the Manager,"The rooms are very quiet at this facility. The furnishings look recently re-done. There is one major problem with this facility. There are very few city views. Most of the rooms are either facing an interior covered atrium, or ""no view rooms."" I had paid extra for a ""city view room,"" and when i registered I asked whether that was the room I was getting. I was assured that It was, but upon arriving at the assigned room, I looked out the window and found that I was facing slanted roof of an adjoining building perhaps 8 feet away. I contacted the manager, and he assured me that I would be moved, but I would have to wait until the next day. We were moved the next day, and we were given free breakfast, but the whole deal was annoying. I felt that the front desk was at best misleading about the initial room, and certainly a hotel at this level should be honest regarding their reservations. An obstructed view of a roof is not acceptable in an upgraded room, and those rooms should not be called ""city view.""",3,2015,06,12
202,Dublin perfection,"Loved the Westin Dublin.  Booked it based on location and couldn't have been happier!  The staff was kind and helpful.  Rooms were actually large, clean and really nice!  Very nice actually.   Starting with a warm fire in the lobby, I felt very welcomed.  The location is truly perfect!  So close to everything and perfectly centralized.   Very close to the Temple Bar area, the University, castle, river etc.  Incredibly easy to get a cab from the hotel as well.  100% I would stay here again.",5,2015,06,11
202,Annual Dublin trip,Located in the heart of wonderful Dublin you are just steps away from most of Dublin's most popular attractions. The hotel offers 5 star service with any possible amenity an international traveler could expect. Rooms were wonderfully decorated and comfortable especially the bed.,5,2015,06,10
202,Excellent Hotel,"Loved this Hotel! Great location, wonderful staff and such a comfy bed! would highly recommend to anybody wanting to see all the sites  and stay centrally. The doorman was a real credit to the hotel sorry I did not get his name.",5,2015,06,10
202,Great Stay in Dublin,"Room was lovely and spacious (especially for Europe!).  The service was great - the staff was attentive, cheerful, and extraordinarily helpful. Our weekend stay came with 3PM checkout which was a nice bonus.  

The hotel is in a great location - easy to walk to Temple Bar, Trinity College, Grafton Street, and the River Liffey. Public Transportation is close by as well. The hotel also has a special deal with 22 Euro taxi fare to the airport compared to 35.",5,2015,06,08
202,Excellent,"Can not say enough good stuff about this hotel.  Staff is professional, welcoming, and helpful.  Hotel rooms, restaurants, and public areas are clean and beautiful.  Food (we only had breakfast) was excellent with many options offered.  Great location.",5,2015,06,08
202,Exceptional staff & first class service..simple an excellent stay!,"Just returned from a fantastic 17 day trip around Ireland with six nights at the Dublin Westin at the beginning and two at the end of our journey. I'm a decades long time top tier Starwood member but have also been in a great many other hotel brands around the world and I am always searching for that  ""perfect"" hotel guest experience. The Dublin Westin delivered that in spades and then some. From Alan and charming Stephen on the door, always a huge smile, some great advice, a compliment, truly ""professional"" high end hotel doormen..to ""can do"" witty and wondeful Anne Marie at the front desk, to the superb staff at the mint bar, Tom and Conor  who despite a full house treat everyone like they are the only guests, It is auite worth mentioning that the Mint Bar has amazing live bands on weekends..and I emphasize, amazing. To Gareth and ALL the concierges and so kind Evan in the breakfast room...this staff takes pride in their work and they understand the real meaning of SERVICE...the old fashioned kind, the kind where if they deliver on a request, they do, and with great smiles and hospitality. Both categories of rooms were just lovely, the hotel itself is gorgeous..upscale graceful public areas and lovely furnishings....that amazing Westin heavenly bed and heavenly pillows, gorgeous marble bathroom with soaker size tub...spotless upon arrival and remained so. Two roaring fires going in the lobby ...hello! and gorgeous large real candle lamps glowing in the arrival lounge, and stunning orchid arrangements everywhere! LOVELY!
The buffet breakfast was absolutely top notch....an exquisite array of high end superb offerings and cooked to order avail on request....weekend Bloody Mary shots and barista coffees included. The hotel is right beside fantastic Trinity College, across from the ""crazy"" Temple Bar area and a short walk from the Liffey. A few minutes to St Stephens Green and Grafton St. Great shopping everywhere and close by. After a week of touring the west coast we returned to the Dublin Westin...to my huge delight, my name was used by both the doorman, Ann Marie at the front desk and Tom and Conor downstairs. Stephen at the door said ""welcome home"" . Welcome home indeed! The Dublin Westin was one of the most enjoyable and memorable hotel stays I have had in many years! Really do suggest that you take the negative reviews with a grain of salt...THIS very particular traveller could simply not find a single flaw or even slight hiccup to write about. PERFECT!",5,2015,06,07
202,Pricey. .,"The Westin Dublin is definitely a beautiful hotel with a fabulous location, but it was very pricey and the service was not the greatest for what we paid for the room. We paid an exorbitant amount of money to stay in one of the junior suites and we received absolutely no room service for our entire three night stay. We had to call down to the desk for toilet paper and to have our garbage pail emptied. We mentioned to the concierge that our room had not been attended to and he ensured us that the next day someone would clean our room, however this did not happen. When we mentioned this to the desk they apologized profusely and sent us each a free drink up to our room. We are not messy people and did not expect to have our towels changed daily, but they should have at least made the bed daily, emptied the small garbage pail daily, and made sure that there was toilet paper in the room - this is not asking too much.
I am disappointed that we could have received better service in a Best Western than we did at this expensive ""5 star"" hotel.",3,2015,06,06
202,Great Location!,"Great base location for stay in Dublin - in the middle of everything and can walk almost anywhere.  Accommodations were beautiful and we had a great view.  Also, after an overnight flight, we were thrilled the room was ready when we arrived around 11:00 a.m.  Highly recommend.",5,2015,06,06
202,"Location, location,location and Service","Westin Dublin has great location. Service is good in the hotel. I also really like how they have setup tha bathrooms in a way that you actually can put your own stuff there too. Some hotel rooms are nice only when empty. In westin they know that customer's do have their things and they want to spread those thins so there needs to be space and drawers.
Breakfast is excellent, both full Irish and the continental.",5,2015,06,05
202,Lovely Refurbished Hotel,Stayed in Dublin on a short break for a concert.  Hotel was great.  Room refurbished and a decent size with nice bathroom.  We slept very well.  Facilities also good with free WiFi throughout.  Gym was well equipped.  Mint Bar super in the basement.  Breakfast was superb and the Manager very attentive.  Staff in general all very good.  Hotel is perfectly situated at College Green opposite Temple Bar.  I would highly recommend and stay here again if i re-visit Dublin.,4,2015,06,05
202,Lovely beds,"Nice, old building, close to Trinity College. Great breakfast with a lot of superfoods. And lovely beds, esp the pillows. But before you go to sleep, please visit the Mint Bar, order a pint of Guiness, wait till the beer has it's black colour and watch it for a minute. It's simply a piece of art.",4,2015,06,04
202,Gorgeous hotel in Dublin,"Hotel is in the best location... staff are super friendly... hotel rooms are clean, up to date. The hotel is right next to a bank which offers no commission exchange (very very small fee, do NOT go elsewhere they will rip you off)

Was very impressed with this hotel",5,2015,06,03
202,Vegan Afternoon Tea - not a chance!,"A number of days previously, I checked and arranged meticulously (by emails) a Vegan Afternoon Tea at this hotel and was assured it was possible.  My friend and I had not met in a number of months and were really looking forward to this however, on arrival after we sat down and after we were served our drinks, we were told they do not do Vegan Afternoon tea afterall and that I had to order from the lunch menu.  I was very upset and disappointed but as my friend is not a Vegan and we already had our drinks , I accepted having no 'Tea' but what I did get was two slices of stale white bread, no soya spread (not in their vocabulary?) and badly cut thick cucumber of which they attempted to charge me thirteen euro.   Although one staff member was nice, another had hardly any English and was very difficult to understand and a third was afraid to come back over.  For a hotel that is five star and supposedly caters for the business class and Americans, they have no idea of modern dietary requirements, i.e. lactose intolerant, nut allergy, gluten free, vegan??  I'm also afraid to say the pre-celtic tiger days of over charging and bad customer service is alive and well here - I will never set foot in this hotel again. - AVOID!",1,2015,06,02
202,Comfortable Dublin hotel,"My daughter and I stayed at the Westin in Dublin at the beginning and the end of a 15 day Ireland trip.   The hotel is well located, one block from Trinity College and the Book of Kells.  The hotel's Atrium is a wonderful place for tea/coffee and pastry or a light dinner/lunch or the occasional Irish coffee.   The rooms were well appointed and the beds were 'heavenly'.  Staff were very accommodating and friendly.  Enjoyed a quiet time reading by the fire in the lobby.  Also very convenient to Starbucks about a block away from hotel.  I would definitely recommend this hotel and would go back if I find myself in Dublin.",5,2015,06,01
202,Afternoon Tea at the Atrium Lounge,"I had afternoon tea at the Atrium Lounge in the Westin with my sister about 2 weeks ago.
The afternoon tea itself was lovely.  The setting is excellent, very comfortable seating arrangements, you're not all piled on top of each other so you kind of feel like you're in your own little private bubble.  Also, the hotel itself is lovely and is an ideal location to get the most out of your trip if you are travelling for an overnight stay.
The food was delicious.  We opted for the traditional afternoon tea with tea/coffee and we can't fault that side of things.  
Unfortunately, to our surprise, the service let them down.  
When we sat down, one of the glasses that was served filled with water had a very obvious lipstick stain on it and it was difficult to get our waitress's attention so it took a while to get that sorted, and after that, we weren't offered any refills of water.
We were given no napkins or cutlery and had to request same, our waitress was quite inattentive so we were left looking at our food trying to get her attention.  
We were also left waiting for hot water refills, and again, it took a while to get the attention of the waitress.
When we were leaving, a different waitress served us at the till and she didn't engage with us nor did she thank us for our custom.
I know these things probably seem minor but the problems were made worse as the waitress was quite inattentive and it was difficult to get her attention so when a problem cropped up we spent 5-10 minutes trying to get the attention of the waitress - we did observe other servers being more attentive to their tables and we didn't notice any other tables having these problems so maybe we were just in the wrong section.

All in all it was an enjoyable experience but I felt I had to write this review as I do want to return and would like to receive the ""luxury"" experience described on the website.",4,2015,06,01
202,Amazing staff,"We booked the Atrium for my sisters baby shower. The staff were so friendly and welcoming. We started with afternoon tea, which was incredible and then had cocktails in the Mint Bar.... Conor, one if the bar men went out of his way each time to make a non alcoholic cocktail for the Mum to be and was so friendly and attentive. He is an absolute credit to the hotel. Thanks to Conor and all the staff for a perfect day.",5,2015,05,31
202,Very Relaxing,"This has to be one of the most relaxing hotels in Dublin.
Rooms are excellent with zero noise, considering one of the busiest Dublin streets outside Hotel.
Food is really very very good , quality freshness and price.
Bars are excellent , service wise.
All of the staff seemingly have a lovely ability to know when a guest requires help.
No downsides only Temple Bar is near. Stay away from temple bar , its just not worth the grief.
Back to hotel , It is handsdown in the top 2 of Dublin hotels .
Very clean , food ,bar , location, ""only 5 mins from Grafton street""  
One tip, ask reception to order a taxi .Do not get one on street.
Great great staff.",5,2015,05,31
202,Best of the best,Our company organised a training course for our customers in this hotel. I stayed here for 3 nights. Everything is absolutely top notch! From staff to food to location to entertainment in the evening. This place is worth every Euro. P.s. can I bring home one of the beds? ;) ,5,2015,05,29
202,Great all the way around,I booked this when I needed something at the last minute. Very reasonable amount of Starwood points for two nights. Fantastic staff and location! Lots of interest in tea in the afternoon. Door men were especially helpful. It's all good. You can't go wrong staying in this hotel.,5,2015,05,28
202,"Great location, great hotel","The hotel is centrally located within quick walking distance to many of the sites to see in Dublin, and is also close to some fantastic restaurants.  The airport bus drops off around the corner and picks up across the street from the entrance to the hotel which makes it all the more convenient for those without a car in Dublin.  The hotel is in an old bank building so the interior layout is quite interesting with meandering hallways for the rooms.  The room was very quite and the bathroom was very impressive.  I find most Westins enjoyable and this one certainly was.  The front desk staff and the doorman were always so pleasant.",5,2015,05,27
202,Unsurpassed Service!,"While our room was delightful and clean, and our breakfasts in the restaurant delicious,  it truly was the service of every staff member that made our stay at the Westin Dublin outstanding. We were there for 7 nights at the beginning and end of our trip to Ireland. It's not always easy to combine the utmost in service at a deluxe hotel with warmth and friendliness, but the Westin staff did it flawlessly. I cannot recall a hotel stay where every staff member we encountered went out of their way to be helpful, from Ross the concierge to Steve the doorman, and the countless housekeeping staff who always responded to our tips with a thank you note.

I'm sure other reviews will cover the great location for tourists, the gorgeous bathrooms with wonderful bathtubs, the cozy Mint bar and beautiful Atrium Lounge, but I wanted to highlight the amazing staff, too.",5,2015,05,26
202,Perfect stay.,"Stayed at the Westin in Dublin, Ireland. The location was perfect, as was our stay. Convenient to walking to the museums, restaurants, and shopping. The staff was very professional, as well as friendly. The concierge staff was helpful and knowledgeable. Loved the traditional decor.
Breakfast was delish with variety as well.
Highly recommend this hotel.",5,2015,05,26
202,"Great city, great hotel location, great hotel","I stayed at the Westin Dublin for 3 nights. Rooms are clean and you can't go wrong with their signature Heavenly bed. Located across the street from Temple Bar and around the corner from Trinity College. The location was perfect for walking around and exploring. The staff was always kind, polite and helpful. Would certainly stay here again when visiting Dublin. ",5,2015,05,26
202,Superb Location,"The Westin it situated less than two minutes walk from Temple Bar, Hard Rock Cafe, Trinity College and the River Liffey.
The hotel is immaculate inside and the staff are very friendly and helpful and seem like they really care about their customers.
If you arrive by car you can leave it in the drop off bay outside the front door and it will be valet parked for a cost of ‚Ç¨25 per night. The car took less than 10 minutes to be bought back to me when I checked out.
The hotel have a very varied choice on the breakfast buffet and the restaurant had a very relaxed atmosphere.
The hotel also has a fairly small gym, but it had two good treadmills and two exercise bikes as well as other equipment.",4,2015,05,24
202,Fantastic weekend away :),"Went to Dublin for a weekend break with husband and friends and had an amazing time. The location of the hotel is fantastic. You are in walking distance to everything. All the staff working at the hotel are friendly. They really want you to have an enjoyable experience. A special mention to the doormen because it was these two men who told us the best places to go. They were very informative. The hotel itself is stunning. The atrium is beautiful, the mint bar is lovely and relaxing whilst having a drink listening to a singer. I would definitely recommend it to others and return to the hotel if ever I was in Dublin again. 

We went to the Guiness Factory, The Gaol, a tour of Trinity College and the Book of Kells and Library. We did the Bus Tour. All of the above were very enjoyable and interesting. All the tour guides were very informative and you could see that they were passionate about the subjects that they were talking about with abit of humour thrown in. 

The bars we went to were fantastic. They had live music in most of them which got the crowd going. 

Overall we had an amazing weekend. Dublin is a fantastic city and everyone is very friendly. I would definitely return to the city and hotel!!",5,2015,05,23
202,Immaculate hotel.,"Had 3 night stay over a weekend. Surprisingly quiet hotel room for centre of Dublin near Temple bar, we slept like logs! Very well kept, tastefully decorated hotel. All staff were efficient polite, friendly and very smart! Breakfast was very good but could have been a little better for the money, a minor detail though. We visit Dublin regularly and try to stay in different hotel each time, this was first visit to Westin, won't be the last!!",5,2015,05,22
202,Lovely Hotel,"I booked this hotel as it was so central to both Temple Bar and Grafton and as I had my 80 year old father with me it made sense. I was not disappointed. Great location. 
I was surprised by the somewhat frosty receptionist who was not terribly welcoming but other than that cannot fault any member of staff. Incredibly helpful and polite, really looked after all of us, my dad in particular!
The room was lovely, fabulous beds, so comfy and the bathroom was lovely. The room was a little smaller than expected. The Atrium is a stunning area to relax in away from all the hustle and bustle of the city,
All in all a fantastic hotel, overpriced but lovely. Special mention to Stephen the doorman who was particularly friendly and helpful. ",4,2015,05,21
202,Great location and friendly staff,"Just back from a congres in Dublin, where I stayed 4 nights at the Westin Dublin. Their friendly  staff is serviceminded, the room was large, nice retro bathrom, clean and I appreciate that I could checkin as early as 12.00. This hotel will be my first choice during future visits to Dublin.
Minor disadvantages: No obvious glutenfree alternative in their menu, costs for the use of internet",5,2015,05,21
202,Worth the money!,"Stayed here for one night during our fist stop in Ireland. We had quite a few flight delays and lost luggage, so by the time we arrived we were cranky and tired. The staff at the Westin could not have been more friendly and helpful! They offered to call on our bags and track them for us, offered to get us any toiletries we were missing, and even kept my iphone overnight to charge it for me since our outlet converter was in one of our lost bags! After such a hectic day traveling it was truly worth the money to stay here! Room was exceptionally clean, breakfast in the morning was delicious and needless to say, we were sad to leave. It's also right in the heart of all the action. Temple Bar district is literally two blocks away, with a 5 min walk to Grafton St where all the shopping is, and is also right across from the HaPenny bridge! If I ever visit Dublin again, I will definitely be staying here.",5,2015,05,20
202,Almost faultless,"Booked a large suite overlooking Trinity College.   Extremely quiet -particularly for location 

Great location. Staff efficient and friendly 
Bed was great.   Extremely clean. Not the greatest layout.  Hardly used the living room.  Bedroom was large yet cosy. 

Maybe get a larger TV for the large bedroom 

Shower could have a better nozzle and more pressure. 

Only real irritating thing was the toilet NEVER flushed properly and required about 3 goes.   Forgot to mention to staff.  Not one of those things you want to discuss!! 

Room service breakfast was perfect every morning.  

Very relaxing stay.  Would return",5,2015,05,20
202,Perfection Found in Dublin,"The Westin is almost always a fine property, no matter where they are located, but after more than a week of traveling around Ireland, this Westin never looked better.  Not to take away from it's wonderful attributes in Dublin such as location (it couldn't be located better), and fine staff, and cleanliness and just being in this wonderful old bank building, but this Westin has all the basic elements that American travelers and business traveler expect in a hotel but which is still a high reach for most Irish hotels.  I would recommend this hotel to anyone and everyone as it will not disappoint.",5,2015,05,20
202,One night stay to see an opera,"It has improved, I have stayed here many times over the last 15 years. We had a quiet suite, the management sent us a bottle of wine and breakfast was great. The decor is new and tasteful, and I will go back.",5,2015,05,15
202,Great location and very helpful staff,Stayed two nights at the Weston very central location. Very close to the stop for the green bus and walking distance to many restaurants. The staff went out of there way to answer questions and make sure our stay was delightful,5,2015,05,14
202,Best Concierge Staff Ever!,"Ross and Lazlo took such good care of us. They were friendly and knowledgeable and even went so far as to get us a Vote Yes! pin when they were unavailable in the public market. Room 427 was my favorite, very spacious but husband vetoed double beds. We finally landed in 500, on the top floor with a great view. Specious room but tiny bath, shower only and must shut door to use the commode. 

Mint Bar had a great band but live music is only on the weekends.

Would definitely return as every staff person made us feel like honored guests.",5,2015,05,14
202,"Very friendly staff, staff motivated to make stay extra special","Pros
Very friendly staff - they provided great tips on attractions, transportation, and souvenirs
Staff made our 5-year anniversary stay extra special with flowers and cake
Room is newly refurbished, large, clean bathrooms

Cons
Noise - you can hear temple bar sometimes
On busy street.  Can be crowded when you exit

Tips
They've done a good job of renovating this old bank.  Visit the mint bar on the basement level.",5,2015,05,12
202,Elegance and Location!,"I just got back from spending 3 nights at the Westin and if nothing else, it's all about location, location, location.

You're directly across the street from both Trinity College and Temple Bar, so countless top attractions are within a few minutes walk. Christ Church Cathedral, Ha'penny bridge, Liberty Hall, Trinity College, St. Stephen's Green, Dublin Castle and many more are under a 10-minute walk.

Along with sights, there are countless bars and restaurants nearby, so even on a predictably rainy Dublin day, you don't have to travel far.

The hotel itself is very lovely. In 2001 it was converted into a hotel from a bank, which is why many of the rooms and venues within the hotel have monetary names such as ""the mint"" and ""the vault."" The rooms are decent. They are elegant, but are not huge in size. They have both a tub and a shower and worked well.

The hotel staff is some of the most helpful I've encountered. I had an odd request on our last night. When we flew into Dublin, the airline broke my suitcase. After having trouble with the luggage repair shop, I decided just to tape it up and get it home safely. I asked the front desk where I could buy tape, and instead of sending me out, they said they'd find some. They called a building engineer and he came to my room to assess. After assessment, he said he didn't know where it was, but he'd find me tape. Sure enough, he did. That's service right there.",4,2015,05,11
202,Perfect Location,"This hotel is situated next to Trinity College and close to most sights and great restaurants. Our room was large and nicely appointed. The concierge crew could not be more friendly and helpful. Daragh arranged for me to have a taxi tour of Dublin and Howth (beautiful fishing village 30 minutes away) by a wonderful Global driver named Allan, who was charming. Other wonderful concierge employees included Simon, Garreth and Georges. All provided excellent service. I hope we can return to Dublin and stay here again.",5,2015,05,11
202,Fantastic!!,"Three things made our week long stay at the Westin in Dublin amazing.

First: each and every member of staff were friendly, helpful and went out of their way to assist with our every need. From super early breakfast take away parcels to planning day trips to see a bit more of Ireland. The reception, concierge, doormen and bar and restaurant staff were all both professional and warm and friendly.

Second: the location is unbeatable - walking to most of the major tourist sites is just a few minutes. 

Third: The room was great. We were lucky enough to get a 5th floor room with a view over Trinity College. The facilities in the room are everything I expect from a 5 star hotel. The room was spacious, clean and quiet with a very comfortable bed. It also has a decent coffee machine for first thing in the morning coffee. 

Should we ever go back to Dublin - The Westin will be our hotel!!",5,2015,05,10
202,"Great, but Shelbourne & Merrion also give great service as well a Dublin experience","Good
- great location
- large room
- comfy bed & duvet
- great bathroom with separate shower & bath 
- Mint bar does the best cocktails in Dublin
- 24 hour fitness room (small but adequate)
- excellent staff

Bad
- once you step in the door, you could be anywhere in the world. Other 5 star Dublin city hotels - Merrion & Shelbourne, you know you are in Dublin/Ireland
- Annoying how breakfast menu has whole list of things that cost extra - already paying 5 star prices - this is unacceptable
- restaurant was closed on a Thursday & food in Mint bar was average (cross over ha penny bridge - 8 minute walk - to Dublin's best restaurant - the winding stair - or more funky & casual to temple bar's Elephant & Castle)
 - no spa in hotel",4,2015,05,06
202,A great location/heavenly bed.  ,"A fine hotel in a great part of Dublin, centrally located.  Would return!  Stephen greeted us when we drove up, everyone was super, we could not find one complaint and the heavenly bed is a plus!  We could walk everywhere and every person at the hotel was extremely helpful.  They went above and beyond.  They suggested a place to eat our last night that was simply wonderful!",5,2015,05,06
202,"Beautiful hotel, friendly helpful staff, central location","What a delight!  The Westin Dublin is centrally located in the city, across from Trinity College.  Many sites, restaurants & pubs are within convenient walking distance.  The building itself is old, and beautifully renovated to comfortable, modern standards.  Food served here is excellent too.

The staff is exceptionally friendly, helpful with making reservations, suggesting things to do, and helping us make plans for sightseeing and how to get around. Plan on spending several nights . . .we did.  Also, they're part of the Starwood loyalty system, so bring your membership # if you have one.  No charge for I-net service in your room if you're a member.",5,2015,05,04
202,Afternoon tea at the Atrium ,"Visited the Westin Hotel on Westmoreland St. Dublin for afternoon tea . It was in the area called The Atrium . The tables were placed throughout to seat various numbers . The armchairs were most comfortable looking . I was part of a large group so a long table was set for us at the rear of the room . Crisp white linen gleamed on the table . Our seats were large and not the usual kitchen chair either! Tea was served by the attending waitress or coffee if you preferred . Little tea strainers accompanied each cup. Wow when food arrived we all gasped in delight . A 3 tiered plate rack was shared between two people . On the lower rack was finger sized sandwiches with various fillings and  2 little smoked salmon brown buns . The 2 tiered held scones and carrot cake . The top tier was filled with red velvet mini muffins , pannacotta in a little dish , chocolate mousse and lots of other sweet treats . We were attended to with the utmost attention . If by chance there are any treats left you can ask for a little box to take them home . A must do for a special occasion . This is a 5 star hotel and it shows ! Brilliant ",5,2015,05,04
202,Superb afternoon tea,"I spent a wonderful afternoon here today enjoying some old school tea. The location is lovely,  the hotel is beautiful, the staff polite and attentive. So far so good. The afternoon tea was served on lovely vintage style china and the food was amazing. Delicious sandwiches,  scones,  cakes and desserts.  We really enjoyed it and look forward to going back for ankther saturday treat!  Highly recommend!",5,2015,05,02
202,Vacation,Very nice hotel with a great location across the street from Trinity college.  The St Stephens Green park is a short walk away and well worth your time. Absolutely beautiful flowers and grounds. The hotel has top notch facilities and very helpful people to guide you. ,5,2015,05,01
202,Best location,Literally across the street from temple bar and restaurants . 15 minute walk to Guinness factory . Very nice lobby and staff. Starbucks is next door. I would recommend staying here for anyone interested to easy access to Dublin. Enjoy your visit . ,5,2015,04,29
202,Excellent location in Dublin's City Centre,"I spent 3 nights at the Westin Dublin on my first trip to Ireland.  The location is perfect if you want to explore the city on foot.  Trinity College is literally around the corner.  Grafton Street for shopping and Temple Bar for the pubs are just a few blocks away.  You can also catch one of the city tour buses to take you around town as well to places like the Jamieson Distillery and Guinness Brewery.

My ""classic room"" at the Westin was on the 5th floor and interior-facing with the windows overlooking the Atrium Lounge.  The room was chic and comfortably furnished.  The bathroom was gorgeous.  The staff and service were friendly and accommodating.  I blew a fuse almost immediately because I forgot to use a converter, and the facilities person promptly fixed it.

Because I was still getting over the jetlag, I had a couple of meals in the Atrium lounge at somewhat odd hours but the light dishes were delicious - a braised pork sandwich with an apple and fennel slaw, and the smoked Irish salmon plate with brown soda bread.

Sightseeing was easy.  I walked out the main door,  turned left and there was the entrance to Trinity College just across the street.  It was worth it to take the short, informative and entertaining campus tour that was given by a couple of grad students.  The tour ticket included entrance into the library to see the Book of Kells.

The shopping area at Grafton Street was just a few blocks away from the Trinity College entrance.  There were street performers singing, dancing and even juggling.  And a guy on stilts wearing a Spiderman costume.  It was all good fun.  

Because I was a single woman by myself, I didn't venture into the pubs much in the Temple Bar but I poked my head in a few places and noticed the merry-making.  It made me wish my husband had been able to travel with me (I was there on a weekend before a business trip).

Definitely try the Westin if you get a chance to stay in Dublin.  It's the perfect location for sightseeing in the city.",5,2015,04,27
202,Classy and Quirky,"Had a one night weekend stay at the Westin Dublin. 

The staff are amazing; reception and concierge have a natural flair for making your stay really personal.  Little touches like umbrellas to use when the weather does it's worst and picking up on your plans during a conversation to help and guide you with travel suggestions, not forced but genuine  - well done!

The Mint Bar downstairs is a must with an extensive cocktail menu and again fantastic service with live music on the Saturday evening too.

The rooms are very well appointed with everything you could need and a spacious bathroom.

Highly recommend a stay at this quality central Dublin hotel - near to Grafton Street for shopping and near to the Temple Bar area for a lively night.

PS try the exquisite afternoon tea in the Atrium..served daily, you won't be disappointed!",5,2015,04,26
202,Great Location and Excellent Service,"Perfect location for the heart of Dublin city and the service every step of the way was excellent.  We were of the advantage that we know the city well and knew where the hotel was located so getting the Air Coach direct from the airport was easy takes about 30 minutes and reasonable (can be booked online) with the Trinity College drop off stop being right around the corner from the hotel (pick up stop directly opposite!)  We had a deluxe room on the Trinity College side which didn't have much of a view because of the roof heights of surrounding buildings, but we were not put off by this mainly because we visit family in the city and we go to spend time with them.  Would recommend you visit the Atrium Lounge, we had afternoon tea there and it was scrumptious ... we were very hungry and the two of us struggled to finish it all, we made the effort though as it was all too good to leave!  The Mint Bar in the old vault is excellent, great bar snacks and a variety cocktails, beers and wines, not over priced either.  We had breakfast in the hotel one morning and it was a good selection of continental or full Irish buffet which was replenished regularly, our only comment was that the pastries were a bit dry and hard on the buffet ... I know we were attending later in the service but I still would expect them to be fresher and lighter, perhaps they need to invest in some covers rather than just open in baskets, or not put so many out in the first place and replenish more often.  However all in all it is a fantastic hotel with great staff and we will certainly be staying there again.",5,2015,04,24
202,The best location in Dublin,"This hotel is located in the midst of Dublin, right next to Trinity College and Grafton St. and on the other side of the road infront you'll find the Temple Bar area. A short few minutes walk over the Liffey River and you'll find the other large shopping area, around Henry st.

We had a deluxe room facing the street infront of the hotel, but was not bothered at all with the traffic. The room was smaller than expected, and could only barely fit the extra bed we needed. With luggage the room was actually a bit crowded. The bathroom had both a tub and a shower, separate from each other, and good space for all three of us. 

The rooms and hallways are clean and neat, with a contemporary decor. The pictures on the web site give a good impression of what you can expect.

By Norwegian standards I would say that this hotel is a 4 star property, and a good one at that. But as it states itself as a 5 star hotel, well, the prices are high as well. The WiFi costs 15 Euros per 24 hours, quite expensive I think. It was cheaper for us to use our Norwegian phone service...

All in all, if you're looking for a sentral hotel, with smiling and pleasent staff that will assist you with everything you need, look no further. I would og back, but definately have at least the same category of room, no smaller.",4,2015,04,23
202,Great Service!,"We booked this last minute on our Ireland road trip, and everything worked out flawlessly. The room was prepared with a third bed, extra toiletries and towels, etc., just as requested, check-in was quick and friendly, the hotel property at a really perfect location for Dublin sightseeing on foot. Breakfast was pleasant, and my cousin was especially enamored by one of the buffet manager, who was very friendly. All-round great, and if we come back to Dublin we are without a doubt staying here.",5,2015,04,22
202,Great place and Staff!!,Great location and very friendly helpful staff. Wanted to also make mention of our private driver / tour guide Brian O'Reilly. Great recommendation by concierge and great guy. Was an absolute pleasure to spend 12hrs with him on our coastal tour. ,5,2015,04,21
202,Great Location - Excellent Hotel,"We stayed at the Westin for 4 nights recently.  LOVE the location - center of Dublin, and easy access to all the restaurants/pubs/shopping.  Just walk across the street or down the block for ANYTHING you want.  Transportation was easy to access, the doormen were incredibly friendly and very helpful when we asked questions.  

Check in and checkout staff were very nice, as well as the restaurant and Concierge.  I would DEFINITELY stay here again.  Coming from the U.S. we were told that the hotels would be small, the rooms would be small - but we didn't see this at all !   Great view of O'Connell Street and the friendliest people!

Highly recommend and can't wait to come back to Ireland (and this Westin Hotel).",5,2015,04,20
202,Very nice hotel excellent location ,"Very nice hotel big rooms, clean and nice bathroom separate shower and bathtub. Excellent location in the center of town with all shops, bars, etc... walking distance. 
Breakfast was not up to standards quite limiting. 

Good business services access to Pc printer and scanner for free.

Would stay again and get breakfast in one of the dozen shops outside.",5,2015,04,19
202,Great hotel in the middle of the action. ,"I stayed here on two occasions recently while in Dublin. Both times were a positive experience. The hotel is older with a lot of charm and interesting in its layout. 

I had the great experience of being upgraded twice to suites. The suites here are all named after historic figures and each has its own style and unique layout. My first had a spiral staircase to a small loft area looking out a window to the action down below. The second was a more traditional suite layout but spacious. 

Bathrooms are a little older but lots of room and no complaints. Beds are to Westin standards and very comfortable. The gym is a little cramped but a variety of equipment. 

Great thing is the location next to temple bar area and that the staff are all friendly and welcoming. Food in the Mint Bar and the Atrium (this one serves breakfast, lunches and teas) was tasty and good service. 

Thank you Westin Dublin for two great stays!

202,Dublin Town,"Stayed here in September 2014
Was a great location and the room was extremely spacious for over the pond! 
Right in heart to everything and the staff was extremely wonderful!!!! Food was just okay I the restaurant but hey it's Ireland and I wasn't there for the food. The hotel is in an old bank building and its charm and architecture was beautiful! Again the heavenly beds were amazing and rooms have a huge bathroom !",4,2015,04,15
202,excelent service in the middle of dublin,"I had a very nice room with no noise from the center of the city and a realy comfortable bead. Service was excelent and I had the best scrumbeled eggs ever for breackfast. Good choice. WLAN is free for members of the Starwood prefered guest program. In the room there is one german power socket and in addition the receiption braught a power socket adapter for me, because I forgot mine.",5,2015,04,15
202,"Very good location, friendly staff","We stayed 5 nights in March 2015, we are a family  of 4 with 2 children.  We had 2  rooms for the family during the stay.  The one room offered a view to edge of Temple Bar, and was a good size.  The other, with less of a view, was very well sized.  Rooms were finished to a very good standard, comfortable beds, and the cleaning service was good.  We ate in the 3 restaraunts for various meals.  The service was good overall.  However, when we ate in the hotel for breakfast our porridge order was forgotten.  I feel the staff should have handled the problem better, and that there should be a child rate for breakfast.  I was surprised to pay full fee for my 8year old, and then to not be offered any discount when we had to sit for an extra 20min due to there error.  I would recommend the hotel to persons travelling without children.",4,2015,04,15
202,Afternoon tea,one of the most gorgeous settings I have ever been in for afternoon tea..... It was absolutely gorgeous in the Atrium... Staff were sooooooooooo nice and friendly.... The afternoon tea itself was gorgeous and tasty... Will most certainly be going back....,5,2015,04,15
202,Good Choice!,Very nice refurbished hotel! Bed and pillows were comfortable!  There were two soft & two medium pillows that worked well for my husband and I. The hotel staff was friendly. The breakfast at the hotel was good and not overly priced like some places.,5,2015,04,15
202,Great experience,"Professional, accommodating, clean, perfectly located, great food and comfortable atmosphere.  Would love to go bacK.  My room was available at 8am, which allowed me to catch up on sleep.  The rooms are nice and quiet as well.",5,2015,04,13
202,"The BEST Westin I have visited, hands down!","Well, it is quite obvious from all of the other stellar reviews on this site, that the Westin Dublin is in a class of its own.  But unlike other hotels that might have a great facility (which this hotel does, don't get me wrong) or a fantastic location (well that too, next to Trinity College and the Temple Bar District), this hotel knocked me over time and time again with their incredible (and genuine) attention to customer service.  EVERYONE I came into contact with, from the doorman to the desk agent to various housekeepers working hard on the room floors, I was always greeted with a smile, a warm ""Good Day"", and if I asked for anything they were all over it to take care of my request.

One of the events that made this trip special (and it's always the little things, isn't it?), I'm sitting off the lobby at 4 in the morning, up with jet lag and surfing the free lobby internet, when a bellman ""Peter"" approached me and after wishing me a ""Good morning"" informed me that he had just made a fresh pot of coffee and might I want some?  Absolutely, and as if this gesture wasn't enough, he returns with a full coffee service, silver tray, silver pot (got about 4 cups out of that), cream, sugar, the whole shebang, sets it on the table next to me and just smiles and nods.  No charge, he just did it.  Not THAT is the definition of service in my book.  And to the Westin management, although Peter's kind gesture did not reap you any revenues that dreary morning, my wife and I made it a point to enjoy quite a few dinners (and more than a few adult beverages) down in The Mint, which we may not have done if Peter wasn't such a great ambassador for your hotel.  

Also need to mention Ross, the concierge who set us up with a rental car, seats on our return flight, and numerous recommendations around town.  He's tip top and an asset to your hotel.  Also, Steven, a doorman who gave us some great recommendations for dining around the area, and always had a smile for us upon our return (even though some of those the poor guy was standing in the rain doing his job).

In summary, the Westin Dublin has probably been the BEST hotel experience I have EVER had, and that's covering a lot of ground in not only Europe and Asia, but in the US as well.

Thanks for making our trip a GREAT one!",5,2015,04,12
202,Would give 10 stars if I could - Outstanding,"This hotel is probably one of the nicest I've ever stayed in, and I'm picky! The online reviews and description looked amazing, but it is 10 times better in person. The hotel is perfectly situated in the heart of Dublin city centre, very close to an array of shops and the Temple Bar pub area. The building itself was very impressive and my partner thought we'd walked into the wrong hotel when we arrived as he couldn't believe that we were staying there! The room was immaculate and very up to date, with a lovely view of Trinity College from our window. All amenities you would expect were provided. The concierge and hotel staff were more than helpful and were able to recommend some lovely places to eat in the city. Would give this 10 stars if I could, and this would be the first hotel I would be trying to book into should we have the pleasure of returning to Dublin.",5,2015,04,12
202,"Excellent location, very nice rooms, service could be better","Excellent location (in fact, I doubt that there is a more centrally located good hotel in Dublin). Spacious and clean rooms. Good restaurant with above average food. 

Service was ok until we have to solve ""a problem"" (entry card stop working). Overworked receptionist was less than helpful. Also, the service in restaurant was friendly but somewhat slow.",3,2015,04,12
202,Good hotel,"This hotel is in a good lthough busy location, but comfort will depend on the room you get. I stayed overnight for business and the room was good and functional. The room was comfortable, but no view.. Staff were ok... Not rude but not overly friendly.  Next visit to Dublin, will probably take advice of locals and stay closer to st Stephens green.",3,2015,04,12
202,Westin is perfect location.,"We had not been to Dublin for a family weekend for sometime so for a change we decided to book into The Westin. We were so glad that we choose this hotel. From the moment we landed we were made to feel special. The concierge was so friendly and obliging, we had arrived early but he took care of everything immediately. The hotel is in the best central location to spend a weekend break. The room was for a family of three and the beds were so comfortable. I know this might be a minor thing to comment on but the pillows were the best that  I have ever slept on. I would loved to have had afternoon tea as it looked great but I have dropped enough hints to my husband about going back again soon. Breakfast was lovely and again the staff were very attentive. Overall it was a great family break.",5,2015,04,12
202,6 stars (not 5),"Location, service, restaurant food, value.

This place is amazing!  We did book on points, but paid real  money for the food at the Mint Bar and Atrium, so it's fair to talk about value.  I had the quinoa salad twice- once with chicken and once with shrimp.  Wife had the Curry Chicken and the next day some melted cheese thing which she loved.  And the server brought over more bread- ""soda bread""- when we asked.

The location is extraordinary- blocks from everything.  We've stayed at some nice hotels in many European cities (Westin Paris, Ritz Vienna, Westin Paris, etc.) and this was best experience.

Staff was great- recommended dinner places that we loved, and were reasonably priced.  After getting the recommendation, double-checked on TripAdvisor, and TripAdvisor recommended them too.

Oh, and the weather was great- which definitely helped! :-)

When (not if) we come back to Dublin, we'll stay here again.",5,2015,04,11
202,Disappointing Customer Service,"Start with the negatives first and end on the positives:
We believed we'd booked a twin but was allocated a twin on arrival. When we pointed out the error the response was shruggish and we waited 15 minutes to be allocated a new room which we had to pay an additional charge for. I felt this showed a lack of goodwill and depersonalised the level of service available at the Westin.
There was no offer of a complimentary newspaper and the option to join the membership scheme which would have given discount in the restaurants wasn't offered until the end of the stay. I still haven't received anything back from the membership scheme, 4 weeks later. 

On the plus side the room was very comfortable and the bed was incredible - unbelievably comfortable.",3,2015,04,11
202,"Location, Location, Location","Did mention location??? Best place for lodging in Dublin, Ireland. Across the street from Trinity College, walking distance to various historic landmarks, and the hop-on/hop-off bus stop is literally steps away from the hotel entrance. I was able to explore the city more than I had expected. My room was clean, with plenty of complimentary water. Staff was friendly, and helpful. ",5,2015,04,09
202,Beautiful surroundings!,"My boyfriend took me to Dublin for a weekend break. I was unaware that he was actually planning a holiday to remember as he asked me to marry him during our trip! I could not have wished for this wonderful event to happen in a more perfect place. 
The hotel is stunning, the reception and mezzanine area have been tastefully decorated in an elegant period style. The room we stayed in (420) was spacious, warm and had the most fantastic bathroom. The breakfast during our stay was sublime with lots to choose from. But I think the thing that sets this hotel apart is the friendly helpful staff. Unbeknown to be my boyfriend had been in contact with the concierge team at Westin Dublin and they had helped him to arrange a brilliant event for the night of our engagement. They helped him to secure a restaurant reservation at Pearl Brasserie a nearby restaurant (I'm going to write a review for them next!) 
The whole trip was fabulous and we are very grateful to the Westin team for all their help! After this experience, I am excited to stay in the new Westin Austin hotel later this year when I travel to the States for a wedding.",5,2015,04,09
202,Beautiful Hotel,"we have just been to the Westin for the weekend, the hotel is really beautiful and the staff on reception very attentive. Disappointed that our 11 year old son was expected to sleep on an air bed as they had a shortage of beds!!! At nearly 300 euros a night they should be able to afford more beds! Breakfast seemed chaos and for all 3 mornings there were large queues, long waits for food and long delays in clearing the tables. The location, appearance, decor and cleanliness were lovely shame about the other niggles for a hotel that prices itself amongst the best ",3,2015,04,07
202,Week End Break,"If you fancy a trip to Dublin as we have just done, I can highly recommend The Westin Hotel. It is very centrally located and near numerous Restaurants and Pubs for the obligatory glass or 2 of the famous Guinness. The Hotel Staff are highly efficient and Customer Service is obviously their first priority. Having stayed at many hotels in a lot of countries these are amongst the best you will find. Nothing is too much trouble. We mentioned during check in to Coleen, that we were here for the Easter Weekend and it was also our Wedding Anniversary. We found later in our room a small cake with Congratulations on it. This was a lovely touch. I can also recommend the Guinness Factory Tour but also do go to the Irish Whiskey Museum on Grafton St. near the Hotel, the tour is very good. We loved Dublin and will hopefully return soon, when we do it will be to The Westin Hotel. Thank you to everyone.",5,2015,04,07
202,"Well Located, Nice Hotel","Came here on a business trip and stayed for one night.

Beautiful interior, very periodic and well done. 

Large room, massive, beautiful bathroom. The bed was so comfortable I did not want to get out of it!

Very easy walking distance to the shops on Grafton Street and to Temple Bar in the evening.

The only negative for us was that the bar closed unusually early for a hotel and for the price paid for the room - you would normally expect residents would be able to get a drink past 11pm! Couldn't even order alcohol to the room. 

Some of the room views are also a little bizarre - a colleague's looked straight out on to a red brick wall only a couple of inches away and my own looked in to a very small courtyard with other windows looking on to it to, had to keep my curtains closed the entire time for privacy.

Otherwise, would highly recommend.

202,Best hotel we have stayed in Dublin.,"The room just blew us away, fantastic room, huge king size bed the bathroom is out of this world, I could easily stay for a week, but staying 3 nights, we've just had food in the bar, omg tasty, and very very nice, staff are great too. We will come back here. Love it..",5,2015,04,03

202,"An average hotel, but below average considering its price","The beds are comfortable, the rooms are nice, and the people who work there are VERY kind, but clearly they are understaffed and not well trained in service, hospitality, and the system of the hotel. The room was missing some of the basics, like a tea kettle, and one of our bags was not brought up, and it took some time for it to be delivered. Also I think its quite crazy to have to pay for WIFI and parking (but especially WIFI) in a hotel of that price caliber. The location is unbeatable, so if your bottom line is location, reliable sleep, clean room, then this is certainly the place to go, but considering it's price point, I expected more.",3,2015,03,31
202,Great Location,"The Westin Dublin is in the perfect location, short walking distance to everything.  We stayed for four nights over the New Years Eve holiday.  Although I liked the property, I seemed to never be able to relax.  The reservation wasn't correct and the front staff just kind of stared at me when I brought it to their attention.  The manager was helpful and figured it out though.  Our room was one of the ""Writer's Suites"" which had a balcony.  However the balcony is TINY and has 6' stone walls around it so you stare directly into a wall.  You can not see anything.  I thought the basic rooms were better.  The front door staff and concierge were good.  The overall experience was just OK, but the hotel is in the BEST possible location. Maybe I never really felt like a welcomed guest because of the New Years holiday (busiest season).   I will stay here again and give it another try.",3,2015,03,30
202,Classical hotel in the centre of Dublin,My wife and I stayed here for a month in January 2015. The front desk service is very friendly. The hotel feels fresh and recently refurbished. The breakfast area is fantastic and again the service was amazing! The rooms are a bit too dark for my tastes and the mezzanine cafe area is also a little dark and a bit cold in winter. The gym is compact but modern and worth a visit once you have digested breakfast:) Best rooms don't look onto the Atrium!,4,2015,03,27
202,Fantastic!,"I stayed here a few months ago and it was just beautiful! The man helping us at reception was so helpful and friendly and really helped us out! Food and service was great! We will definitely be back! We stayed in a suite which I would definitely recommend for special occasions, great views of dublin city!",5,2015,03,26
202,Great Hotel and Location,"You could not ask for a better location than the Westin.  Though not usually a name you consider with 5 star properties this is the best hotel in Dublin.  Close to the cultural sites and nightlife.  Great access to all the restaurants and pubs that make Dublin unique.  The rooms are well designed and the bed was very comfortable.  Overall a nice place to stay, with very helpful staff, great bar, and the best location.  This is the place to stay in Dublin.",4,2015,03,25
202,First class hotel,"A wonderful hotel with old world charm and standards. Almost like stepping back in time 100 years.

Greeted on arrival by a liveried doorman and shown into a room steeped with charm and grace.

Huge room with excellent beds a good work area and clean, spacious bathroom.

The hotel promises a lot and certainly delivers. The staff could not me more helpful.

Free WiFi but no smoking rooms.

That is, to be honest the only downside, smoking is outside, on the main street. No cover and no seating. Yes I know, it's a disgusting habit, but I smoke and in this one aspect I was made to feel an outcast.",5,2015,03,25
202,"Excellent, interesting and insightful tour!","I had arranged a tour for a group of hospitality students around the Westin. It was absolutely fantastic! The staff were incredibly helpful and friendly and couldn't do enough to help us. The hotel itself was beautiful and luxurious and is currently undergoing some improvements which are looking fantastic. The unique layout of the indoor, cortyard-style restaurant is truly spectacular and is certainly worth experiencing at least afternoon tea in, which the hotel is renowned for. The bedrooms, even standarrd rooms, are huge and the beds are truly heavenly. The bathrooms are also very large and have both an individual shower and bath, everything seems to have an air of luxury about it. I thoroughly enjoyed the tour and cannot thank the staff enough for such a wonderful experience, especially the front office assistant manager Lun and the human resources manager Sinead. I can't wait for my next trip to Dublin to stay here!",5,2015,03,25
202,Wonderful location,"With one small exception, the Westin Dublin was a typically good Starwood experience. The location was great for walking around the city, which was especially useful since we had a very short time in Dublin. We were so, so grateful they were able to check us in immediately when we arrived, jetlagged, at about 8:30 in the morning -- they were apologetic that it was a room facing the courtyard atrium space, and we're saying ""it could be in the basement as long as it had a bed."" Which it did, a comfortable one, and it wasn't in the basement -- the room as a whole was very comfortable, with a particularly nice bathroom. The hotel bar and restaurant were solid options when we didn't have enough time to venture out. 

The one minor glitch was that, when we arrived, the room was really hot. We turned the heat down, but it must have re-set in the night, because we woke up stiflingly hot and had to turn it back down before getting back to sleep. Otherwise, we couldn't have been happier.",4,2015,03,24
202,"Great hotel, centrally located","This is a luxurious hotel situated within walking distance of most things.

Breakfast was good, room was very nice, large and comfortable.

One star deducted for very slow service in the Atrium, and for a broken lock on our bathroom door. I'm also unimpressed by expensive hotels that charge for wi-fi in the rooms.

Overall though, I'd be happy to stay here again.",4,2015,03,24
202,"Comfortable, friendly, and conveniently located","I love this hotel! The staff is great, so friendly and helpful.  The rooms are great! Heavenly beds make it.  I've stayed here 4 times and never been disappointed. Also mint bar has great cocktails. Great place to stay for business or pleasure.",5,2015,03,23
202,Highly Impressed,"I stayed here last week on vacation and this hotel is beautiful, clean, and comfortable. It is centrally located in Dublin and within walking distance to a lot of wonderful attractions. The staff was absolutely wonderful and the hotel bar bartenders were some of my favorite people I met during my time there! Heidi at the hotel bar was so friendly and a pleasure to talk to. I will be staying here the next time I'm in Dublin and would absolutely recommend it highly to anyone.",5,2015,03,23
202,Friendly and conveniently located,The hotel and bar and restaurant staff were all wonderfully helpful and friendly. For the tourist who wishes to see some of the best of Dublin on foot the location was fabulous. The room was very clean and the bed comfortable.,5,2015,03,22
202,Outstanding staff and hotel!,"I stayed at the Westin in a twin bed room with a friend of mine for 10 days over St. Patrick's Day. This was one of my all time favorite hotels. The accommodations are top of the line. The beds are just that ""heavenly"". Very good size rooms. Centrally located in the city centre, this is the hotel you should stay at. 

Now for the review of staff, everyone from Stephen the doorman, to Tom, Connor and the ladies at the Mint , you will not find a better staff at any hotel. I travel 2 weeks a month for work and I have never experienced such a lovely staff. All were very kind, gave us great suggestions as to where to go to see true Dublin and not tourist traps. 

You must try the afternoon tea at the Atrium and the food at The Mint is exceptional as well. 

Westin Dublin Management please let your staff know that I wish I could take them with me on my business trips and that I miss your accommodations already! 

I will never stay at another hotel while I visit Dublin. The Westin Dublin is the only hotel for me. ",5,2015,03,21
202,Best hotel in Dublin luxury at it's best and amazing friendly Staff- a credit to Dublin,"From the moment we arrived Steve the door man became our friend and welcomed us in. All the staff ( and I mean all) were so helpful, friendly and polite the guys and girls in the Mint bar were funny and knowledgeable , Tom and Conner were really very nice, You have to try the afternoon tea at the Atrim , we had  Victorian Mojito is served in a large pot, the pot holds a portion of ‚Äòtea‚Äô for two with the Most peculiar menu - delicious and very filling , great place thoroughly recommend it ! The beds were so comfy and all in all 10/10. The hotel staff are great to recommend places to eat  although for us the hotel was enough. St Patricks day was a blast ! Great location and the hotel does Dublin Proud ! We will be back thank you to everyone from Sarah and Heather :) x",5,2015,03,21
202,Luxury at the top of its class!,"We have stayed in the Westin Hotel Dublin, for two years now( hopefully a third this year) and the service keeps getting better and better each year. As part of a Christmas Tradition, shopping, dining and staying overnight, the Westin is our First and only choice of hotel when staying in City Centre Dublin.
First of all, the location of the hotel is in the very heart of Dublin, whether you like the historic building and libraries of Trinity College or Kildare street, the Busy shopping district of Grafton and O‚ÄôConnell  street, or just there for the excellent food and ‚ÄúCraic‚Äù that Dublin has to offer, then the Westin Hotel should be the top choice of hotels. 
Secondly, the service is above and beyond. As part of the SPG hotel  group the hotel boasts an array of partners if you are a member, and simply booking a hotel room gives you this opportunity to be a member, and it does pay off, as if you are travelling to any 5 star hotel in one of the major cities in Europe or the World abroad, then simply say you are member, show your card and you can avail of discounts galore.
The Hotel: is wonderful, from the steps up to the foyer, to the steps down to the Mint Bar. The wooden floors of the reception area, the open fire and the lush surroundings make the occupant feel right at home the moment they step into the hotel.  Upon checking in, you are given your Key card which has to be used in the elevator therefore ensuring the complete privacy of the guest. The rooms are truly amazing. Modern but extremely lush, even if you are only there to sleep, the Bed is the biggest and the most comfortable you will ever sleep in, The d√©cor is beautiful and the Bathrooms are marble and come complete with fluffy bathrobes and slippers. The hotel products are subject to having an amazing Spa in the hotel, so you can indulge in the morning rituals and escape in the aromas of the Spa.
Having stayed there twice now, we have had two different rooms, our first having a view of Trinity College and the Second and most recent right over the hotel front, looking down dame street, and seeing all the way down O‚ÄôConnell Street. 
A Quick Cocktail?  Head to the Mint Bar, (something festive for the lady as they have a plethora of cocktails and spirits to suit every taste & I would advise the Beam Old Fashioned) served by the friendliest of staff and also experts in their art too. The atmosphere is cool and chic. The bar is centred around the square bar, and only the best ingredients are displayed in the most decadent detail.
Breakfast in Bed is what we choose, and the menu is as long as the door!. Smoothies, juices, coffees, teas, healthy, hearty, sweet, savoury and any time in the morning is served on silverware and fine china. 
The overall rating of this Hotel is 5 star, because not only do you get the 5 star hotel, you get the 5 star hotel experience, the pleasantness of the staff and the ultimate topping to your visit to Dublin.
If you want the 5 star experience then look and book no further than the Westin Dublin. Chatting to the staff added to the experience, and the Concierge, reception and Door staff are all an absolute pleasure to deal with. I look forward to seeing them all again this year!",5,2015,03,19
202,Overpriced,Visited the Atrium here for afternoon tea with family. While selection of items was good it was overpriced for the amount served. The Mohito tea was served in a teapot between 2 people which would normally be served to 1 person. Atrium was noisy with toddlers running amok. Certainly not worth the money,2,2015,03,18
202,Perfect Stay,"Myself and my husband stayed overnight here on the 8th of March for my birthday. From the start we were made feel very welcome. Staff at reception were very helpful and curtious. We were informed to my delight that we were upgraded because of my birthday. This hotel is fabulous. The decor, the cleanliness (which is a huge factor in my book). Our room was so spacious and spotless. The bed was so comfortable I just wanted to hop into it after arrival but thought best not to. But had the best night sleep that night. Breakfast was gorgeous but quiet expensive. Overall we had a fab relaxing stay and would definately stay over again. Xx",5,2015,03,17
202,"Great location, lovely staff","I really love this hotel in the heart of Dublin. It's location is spot on, close to everything yet not in a noisy location. The rooms are quite large and the bathrooms lovely. The staff are so friendly and breakfast is plentiful.",5,2015,03,17
202,Great Hotel in a great place,"Had booked a Business trip ""as usual"" - and was completely surprised by this Hotel. Really nice, old style - open fireplace in the hall, some big leather chairs next to it. Also rooms equipped nicely & w/ style. Very nice staff. Super central location in the dead center of Dublin. TBH, I'll definitely go back - for Business, but even more so for a private trip.",5,2015,03,16
202,Lovely,"I thoroughly enjoyed my stay at the Westin. The location is perfect. It puts you right next to many areas you'll want to see. Trinity College, Grafton Street, and Temple Bar are right there. The staff is top notch. My room overlooked the street but was not noisy; likely due to being on a higher floor. Lastly, it has all the touches you expect from the best Westins. Worth it if you can swing it. ",4,2015,03,14
202,Most amazing afternoon tea,I paid for this as treat for my sister. And we actually did have the best And most peculiar afternoon tea! It was great fun. Very pretty building which was lovely. The food was fantastic with lots of strange but yummy bits. I would highly recommend. Although I was not a fan of Dublin itself! ,5,2015,03,12
202,Beautiful hotel with plenty of room to indulge and spoil oneself.,"My wife and I stayed at the westin for a three day break. All of the staff were lovely and very professional. Prices were more than reasonable for the luxurious surroundings. A perfect position for a city hotel.
I did have to laugh at one aspect and that concerned the drinks on offer in our room. As soon as I arrived, I was having a look in the fridge and picked out a whisky miniature, read the label then replaced it, only to find that I'd been charged ‚Ç¨6.
Goodness knows how much it would have cost to drink? This was down to a pressure pad type device, which registers when you lift the item. The staff were great and removed it from the bill without fuss. After that occurence I wondered about the squares of toilet tissue, but there was no need.
A lovely time all round, thanks.",5,2015,03,12
202,Outstanding Staff,"We recently stayed at the Westin and had an amazing time there.  From our greeting at Reception by Jelena to the Bar Staff in the Bar everything was professional, courteous and friendly!
We would definitely go back there again.",5,2015,03,10
202,Brilliant Location,"Lovely hotel, excellent location, wonderful comfortable beds, fantastic breakfast, with hot fresh, buffet breakfast served in Exchange restaurant, with view out onto the street to watch the world go by!  Location right in the middle of so much to see, with O'Connell street one side & Grafton the other. Within walking distance of so many tourist attractions & places to eat if you can bring yourself to leave that lovely Atrium dinning room! Didn't venture into the Mint Bar as it seems very loud & we wanted a catchup chat with friends.. definitely recommend this hotel. Loved the idea of area names in hotel, with the building being originally a Bank, seeing I am an ex banker myself :)
We ate in the Atrium Lounge & it was excellent too.",5,2015,03,09
202,Professionals with a smile,"If you have to choose between quality and real friendliness, what do you choose ?
In this hotel you have both.
Nice location, cozy clean rooms with that authentic look, a professional friendly staff, nice breakfast, ...
This hotel is well managed and everybody works to keep their standard... a standard much higher than other places I've been... a standard that makes you a happy smiling customer, even when you receive the bill.",5,2015,03,09
202,Absolutely Fabulous,"We stayed at the Westin Dublin 6-8th March.  From the moment we approached the hotel and were greeted by the doorman and then stepped inside we were made to feel welcome.  Despite arriving hours before the check in we were allowed to use our room.  The entrance reception area is beautiful as was our room.  
The hotel is in a great location for sight seeing, the airport buses and ""hop on hop off"" bus stops are very close as is the main shopping/bar/restaurant area of the city, all within very easy walking distance.  Despite this we were not disturbed by any noise at all.
The staff at the Westin were lovely, so helpful, polite and friendly.  The breakfast was first class and the head waiter absolutely charming.
We had drinks down in the bar one evening and again it was very good, a band played in the corner and the atmosphere was great.
Our room was spacious, immaculately clean, a really comfy bed and a lovely bathroom/shower room.  There was complimentary water in the room which was very welcome and tea and coffee making facilities.  We really cant fault this hotel and would recommend it.  Well done Westin Dublin management and staff thank you for a lovely stay.",5,2015,03,09
202,How handy for Temple Bar? Very!,"Literally cross over the road and you are right in Temple Bar. Close to the river and just as handy for the shops. The room was splendid, very spacious, quiet and comfortable. The bar downstairs offered excellent service. Didn't have chance to have an evening meal, but if the breakfast was anything to go by, then I don't envisage a problem. Not the cheapest hotel but the service made this worthwhile; staff are very friendly. Yes. I'll go again!",5,2015,03,08
202,Luxurious hotel in a great location,"You could not ask for a better located hotel in Dublin. It's right in the centre of things being close to Temple Bar, Trinity College and all the local shopping and sights. We booked a double bedroom with en suite for our long weekend. I don't think we could have found anywhere more luxurious or with better service in Dublin. The room itself was very big and the bathroom was beautifully and tastefully tiles with a huge bath. The bed was wonderfully comfortable and we slept very well.
We paid a little extra to have breakfast included and we did not regret it. There was a choice of hot food - eggs, bacons, Irish sausages (delicious), mushrooms and even black pudding. Other choices include continental type food like breads, cheeses, salami etc. There was also a selection of pastries, cereal and muesli (again delicious). In addition, for a small supplement the chefs will make you eggs benedict. So, there is plenty of good food to set you up for the rest of the day's sightseeing, shopping or business.
The Westin had a lot of staff on hand to help with directions, suggestions and any queries you may have, they also have a helpful conciege service.
The hotel also has a bar/restaurant which we didn't use because we were too busy exploring Dublin. However, it looks like a comfortable, welcoming place to spend an afternoon or evening. The hotel also does afternoon tea.
In all, I would highly recommend this hotel.",5,2015,03,07
202,Great stay. 5 Stars,"I only stayed one night, but had a lovely stay here. Booked via Amex FHR and received a very nice upgrade. Despite being on the first floor I didn't have any noise problems from outside. Perfect location for exploring the City. Having just experienced the lackadaisical attitude of staff at the Westin Times Square, arriving here was a complete contrast. Colleen at reception has a genuine warmth and interest in her customers, and it makes such a difference when the staff engage with you. Next time I'm in Dublin I'll be staying here again.",5,2015,03,05
202,"Nice hotel, great beds",I stayed one night at Westin in Dublin. Friendly and professional staff. The hotel is very classic and just what you can expect from a Westin hotel. The bathroom and the bed was 5 star. I was a little surprised though that I had to pay extra for wifi. That feels kind of old fashion style. its 2015 and most people expect free wifi (or at least I do).,4,2015,03,05
202,Five Star,"Everything about The Westin is just fantastic. The location is perfect, the staff are really friendly and helpful and the rooms and facilities can't be faulted. A special mention to Stephen who welcomed us upon our arrival at the doors of the hotel, sorted out our luggage and throughout the weekend gave us invaluable advice such as which pubs served the best Guinness. Nothing was too much trouble for him. All in all highly recommended ",5,2015,03,03
202,Excellent stay,"From the moment we entered the hotel the staff were professional but friendly and there was a relaxed atmosphere. The room wasn‚Äôt spacious, but very comfortable with everything you would expect from a 5 star hotel ‚Äì bath robes, luxury toiletries, plenty of clean towels, ironing board and iron in the room, and a very powerful hairdryer!

We were offered a late check-out on Sunday, and a very relaxing late breakfast in the Atrium. I had the Salmon Bagel which was delicious!

The hotel is very central and we will definitely stay here on our next trip to Dublin. Thank you for an excellent stay!",5,2015,03,02
202,Westin Dublin - Very Good Stay,"One night stay following a visit three months ago...would love to stay longer as I always find myself here the night before flying out and the hotel is in a great location for some of the best sights in Dublin. Hotel is very elegant, nice furnishings art and decorations...
Warm friendly welcome from Colleen who also checked us out the following morning.
Upgrade to a very nice room overlooking the back of the University, tastefully decorated and a very good bathroom.
Really good bed which does what it says on the tin...quite heavenly!
Very good desserts, coffee and cognac taken in the Atrium but surprised when the lady serving us advised the kitchen was closed at 8pm...good job we had already dined!
Missed breakfast again due to early check out for the airport.
Staff are a great asset here and the concierge was really helpful in sorting out our Emirates chauffeur drive pick up.
Look forward to a longer stay next trip...",5,2015,02,26
202,Excellent Staff,The staff are excellent.  Everyone greeted you with a smile. The staff at the reception desk were very helpful and accommodating. Hotel is close to many pubs and restaurants as well as tourist offices.,4,2015,02,25
202,Perfect Hotel for Dublin,"This hotel is perfectly situated in the centre, so everything you need within Dublin is in walking distance. The staff at the hotel are oustanding and nothing is too much trouble. The spacious rooms are beautifully decorated and to a very high standard, and the beds are the best I have ever slept on in a hotel! The hotel bar is the best hotel bar I have ever experienced, with excellent cocktails and food at reasonable prices, and on Saturday night they had a excellent band which created a brilliant atmosphere.

Breakfast was charged at 17 euros, when checking in, and worth every penny, there was everything you could want for and cooked fresh.

If you want to use the fitness centre, you can hire trainers and socks from Reception for 5 euros

The Air Coach stop is opposite the hotel and is the best way to get to and from the airport, it is only 7 euros each way and runs every 15 mins. 

The only downside to the hotel is that you have to pay for WIFI in the rooms, it is ree int he lobby though. 

I have stayed in a number of hotels in Dublin, but this is the best, and when I, and the other 5 adults I travelled with, visit Dublin again, I would not look to stay in another hotel but the Westin.",5,2015,02,24
202,Perfect stay in a great location,"location, location, location and you cant go wrong with the Westin, Dublin. A stones throw from Grafton Street and Temple Bar, around the corner from trinity, you wont spend a euro on a taxi during your stay. The staff were fantastic and the room was very comfortable and well insulted from the hussle and bustle outside. The beds were very comfortable ( not something i would normally say on a review but these were different class) I will defiantly return, its worth paying that bit more as you are so close to all Dublin has to offer!!",5,2015,02,23
202,A perfect weekend ,"My wife and I had our wedding reception here in early December.
Everything about our experiences over those 3 days exceeded our expectations. Absolutley magical time, would highly recommend for a city break, wedding or as a little bit of luxury. Sinead & Dominic provide top class service and execution for the reception. From the Atrium,  the Banking hall to the Mint Bar...it oozes class and is flawless. Look forward to visiting again soon. ",5,2015,02,22
202,Luxury & comfort,"From the grand entry to the beautiful room to the cozy bar, everything about this hotel is 5 star.  My husband and I were in town for a business trip and decided to go a few days early.  The Westin was a great choice. The hotel is within walking distance from many sights & restaurants. We never took a taxi as the driver told us it was easier to walk to everything we were interested in seeing/doing. (not your usual taxi driver answer). We will definitely stay at the Westin again.",5,2015,02,18
202,5 Stars for real!,"Our three travelers enjoyed our stay here. We are big Sheraton/Westin SPG fans and stay as often as we can find them while traveling. AMAZING service! Hubby got a towel and water from the concierge after a run, we received awesome travel tips from ""my front desk favorite"" Colleen! She is a superstar for knowledge, service, kindness, warmth and remembering the guests! She literally sparkles with Irish charm! We had a 3rd bed put in our double room for our daughter. The beds were outstanding to sleep on after a long flight from California. I can't say enough about the service and location of this Westin. Due to the age of the property, as one would expect, the rooms are small. Though on the street the sound proofing is quite good! It was fun to watch the revelers walk the streets a bit drunk as the evening wore on! It was quite the show! You are right in the heart of it all, Temple Bar, Trinity College, Grafton Street etc. If you have the SPG points for a stay or can cover the expense, the location and service are worth it! We used the Westin for both ends of our trip and it was superb!",5,2015,02,16
202,The Atrium - a most peacful spot in the centre of the city,"A fabulous spot for a private chat, walking distance from most of the important places. High class snacking, light lunches and/or either a gentle start to a business day, or a sip of something soothing at days end. A style and comfort from another age, and the staff are delightful too.
Recommended",4,2015,02,14
202,Perfect for a lazy Sunday,"my sister and I were in Dublin for at concert and shopping we both had been many times but never stayed at the Westin.  We picked the Westin because of its location and we were not disappointed.  We were able to walk to Grafton street and Brown Thomas with ease.  On checking we were asked if we would like a late check out and were also informed if we missed the full breakfast before 10.30 we could avail of the limited breakfast up to 3pm.  Great idea for a Sunday! After the concert we had a few drinks in the lively hotel bar were a band played until late.  Our room looked onto the street yet it was so quiet.  Breakfast was delicious and the staff could not do enough for us.  We were the last to leave the bright and airy breakfast room drinking coffee and chatting and the staff allowed us to sit on.  When we were leaving we were able to avail of the nespresso machine coffee which I thought was a good touch. I would throughly recommend the Westin for location, service and devious breakfasts.",5,2015,02,13
202,great quality hotel,"This is ideally located for central Dublin and is a really high quality hotel.  Very comfortable rooms and bathrooms, a lovely bar and spacious relaxed spaces all around, especially the Atrium!.  The staff were really excellent aswell.  The doormen were really lovely with a great sense of humour and so helpful.",5,2015,02,11
202,Wonderful anniversary weekend,"This is long overdue, we stayed for a weekend in October for our wedding anniversary and wow what a treat, from the moment we stepped through the doors it was fantastic. we have stayed a few times and each time gets better. 

We were looked after so well in the mint bar the food was devine and the cocktails are just amazing! Breakfast was wonderful with plenty of choice and the takeaway coffees were a lovely touch! 

i cannot wait to return to this hotel, its pure luxury.",5,2015,02,11
202,Fantastic Experience!!!,"The entire guest experience at the Westin was exceptional.  The hotel staff were extremely attentive, informative, and cheerful, and really brightened our stay.  Special thanks to Nichola who was particularly charming and helpful.
The location is perfect.  The rooms are great.  Breakfast was fabulous.
This prompted me to register and write my first ever TripAdvisor review.",5,2015,02,10
202,Top stay in Dublin,With steps from the Temple Bar area and right on the Liffy this is where you want to stay if you have a brief stay in Dublin. I stayed at the Westin before take a 10 day tour of Ireland and it was great to be within walking distance to all the major attractions.,5,2015,02,10
202,Superb hotel and staff!!,"We stayed at the Westin for 3 nights prior to a driving tour of Southern Ireland.  The heavenly shower and the heavenly bed are reason enough to stay here!!  Seriously...I think it's quite possibly the best nights sleep I've ever had in my whole life. And that shower....it will wash all your cares (and your jetlag) away!  

The location of the hotel is perfectly in the center of all the action in Dublin.  Wonderful views out every window!  The staff were wonderful and so very accommodating!  We even got a brief tour of the grand ballroom (and saw the Waterford chandeliers!!) which was a treat since the building used to be a bank!

My favorite part was the scent upon entering the hotel...so inviting and invigorating!  The luxury bath amenities smelled the same and now every time I use the lotion I'm reminded of my stay!  I can't wait to return for a longer stay and a longer visit with my favorite city on the planet!

**I would also recommend The Pig's Ear restaurant just a short walk from the hotel.  It was the most superb meal of our trip and such a find!!**",5,2015,02,09
202,very comfortable and well located,"ticks most boxes for a business trip. Good service, well located and the staff went out of their way to take care of us - stayed for two nights and had a conference with ~75 people. Will definitely return.",4,2015,02,09
202,One word - fab-u-lous !!,"Due to inconvenient flight times, I pre-requested an early check in (10 a.m.) and late check out (1 p.m.) both of which were honoured with no extra charge
On arrival from the airport, we were pleased to see not only a doorman to help with the heavy revolving doors, but a porter who offered to take our luggage - a rarity at many hotels these days
This set the tone for our entire stay - everything was ""no problem"" or ""a pleasure"" 
The staff and their attitude set this hotel above very many others, always prepared to help, assist, advise
We dined in the Atrium, the Mint Bar and the Exchange restaurant, and cannot find a fault - the Atrium was my favourite
Our room was a deluxe double, which was stated as having a city view. From the back of the 2nd floor, you don't get to see much of the city, just a pile of chimneys and rooftops ... that was the only, and very minor (I mean, how long do you actually spend looking out of the window?) bad point. To be fair, the fact we were at the rear of the hotel probably meant the room was quieter than one with a street view would have been, so maybe not so bad after all :)
The bed was indeed heavenly - so comfortable - and bigger than expected
An unusual combination of sheet, thin duvet then a thicker duvet in a duvet cover (put on the bed with the opening at the top) We were convinced that the second duvet had been put on upside down in error, but when we mentioned it to our friends who were also staying, theirs had been put on the same way ... not too sure why?
You can even buy the same bed / bedding / pillows - there's a brochure in the room !
If I hadn't just bought a new bed, I would be seriously tempted

The bathroom was very spacious, and came with a full sized bathtub, nice big wash basin, and a separate shower cubicle (and obviously a loo)
The shower was good, water temperature was stable, and water pressure consistent
The range of complimentary bathroom products was good, and there were two face cloths, which was a pleasant surprise
There was also a speaker in the bathroom, which meant you could still listen to a programme whilst in the bathroom - a nice touch

The wardrobe contained two fluffy bathrobes, a full-sized ironing board and a steam iron
The other closet contained a safe, and a full sized hairdryer
The cupboard below the tv contained not only a kettle, but also a coffee maker and some coffee bags!
There was also a fully stocked mini-bar ...

We took the option to forgo housekeeping ""Make a Green Choice"" for the duration of our stay (3 nights) in return for 2 x 5 Euro off our food bill. We were advised at the time of offering that if we needed replenishments of any consumables or towels, we should just ask

The hotel is right at the heart of the city - within walking distance of many attractions, and with plenty of access to public transport links
Indeed, the Aircoach stops right by the hotel

I cannot speak highly enough of the hotel, the staff, the food and the service
The staff must work so hard to keep the hotel standards as high as they are, and may I say to all of them, a very big thank you for making our weekend so memorable for all the right reasons

We will most certainly recommend the Westin to all our friends and family, and should we ever return to Dublin, I can only think of one place that we will stay",5,2015,02,04
202,Great Place to Stay!,"This is a lovely hotel in a fabulous location. It‚Äôs just a step away from Trinity where the airport bus stops and on the fringes of Temple Bar on the south bank of the River Liffe. We didn‚Äôt bother about breakfast as Temple Bar is home to many great places.
The hotel is quiet and the rooms comfortable and very well-equipped. Indeed I wish a few more hotels would put a drip coffee machine and coffee in your room. The beds are lush and the linen gorgeous. The only downside to the hotel is that free Wifi is only available in the public areas of the hotel though the rooms have a broadband LAN connection which you have to pay for.
All the above, plus the fact that the airport bus stops immediately outside the hotel every 15 minutes makes this an ideal place to stay.",5,2015,02,04
202,Top Class,"We stayed in The Westin for three nights to celebrate New Years eve in Dublin. This was our first stay here as we usually stay in another well known Hotel not far from the Westin. We were not disappointed, this Hotel oozes luxury and professionalism from the extremely friendly and helpful concierge to the cleaning staff. The Westin is an excellent example of how to get customer care spot on.
We stayed in a split level luxury suite, that was spotless, comfortable and quiet. We got back to our room on the first evening and there was a bottle of red and a cheese board waiting for us, a very nice touch. The Internet was no extra charge as we are SPG members and worked very well in this room.
We ate twice in The Mint Bar where there was an excellent discount offer for SPG guests. The food was excellent and the cocktails even better. Staff in The Mint bar are extremely friendly and helpful and the atmosphere very relaxing.
As has been said many times, superb location especially as the NYE concert was just next door on College Green.
Breakfast Buffet was one of the best I have seen in any hotel in Ireland with an excellent selection for all tastes, we loved the cold buffet selection. 
This is will be our preferred choice when we visit Dublin from now on.
Would highly recommend it to anyone.",5,2015,02,02
202,Excellent,"Oh the luck of the Irish must have been on my side when chsooing the Westlin.

This is a great hotel, very very well appointed, fantastic staff, very spacious rooms with great beds.

I was very pleased with each and every aspect of my stay there.",5,2015,02,01
202,The Staff and Location make this hotel,"On the surface this Westin is no different than many other SPG hotels in Europe, however there is a charm that sets The Westin Dublin apart and that is due to the staff.  I have rarely been so impressed.  From the front desk, to the waiters at breakfast, to the maids... they are warm, welcoming, truly attentive, and just naturally friendly.  When you travel as much as I do, you forget how much being around naturally pleasant people can make your stay.

As mentioned by others, the location can't be beat. A short walk or cab ride and you're in the thick of everythibg downtown Dublin has to offer.  

Request higher floors.  

SPG Platinum Guests - free breakfast, wifi, very nice welcome gift to my room.",4,2015,02,01
202,Perfect location!,"Rooms are fantastic and breakfast was phenomenal. The location cannot be beat! The hotel is situated right next to Trinity College which is incredible. The staff were great and the hotel has a real luxury feel about it. Parking a bit expensive, but I suppose that comes with the location.",5,2015,01,30
202,"all about the location, but get a room on a higher floor!","Have to agree with other reviewers that you can‚Äôt beat the Westin‚Äôs location: smack in the middle of Dublin city centre and a few minutes‚Äô walk in any direction to the sights and pubs the city is famous for.

The breakfast buffet was fine enough to get us going for the day and the staff were generally professional and friendly.  

The only real let down was the room.  While the beds were comfortable with good linen and pillows, our room on the second floor was dark with a tiny window facing an office block on a narrow street.  This meant we had the lights on all the time and more often than not the curtains closed to keep privacy, even during the day.  The decor is average and doesn‚Äôt really befit the fine building the hotel is housed in.

I would recommend the Westin more for its location than anything else and if you do stay here request a higher floor with a brighter room.

Tip: The receptionist told us that if you book a room through a third party website and make special requests, e.g. a twin room, this information is not necessarily passed on to the hotel.  This hasn‚Äôt happened to us before but it seems best to contact the hotel directly with any requests you have for your stay.",4,2015,01,29
202,"Amazing Staff, great location!","The staff at this hotel was truly amazing! Our room was spacious and comfortable. We had enough space for my husband and I to stay comfortably & we even had a crib brought in for our infant. Even with that we had plenty of space. We spent 2 out of our 3 evenings in the atrium lounge. It's a great space for tea or a night cap. Our son even enjoyed it there thanks to the staff being amazing with him! Sadly I can't remember the name of our server, but he was the best! Brought over cookies and milk & one even took our son for a walk to the kitchen to ask the chef for some cookies. Probably one of the highlights of our trip! Great hotel. Only down side was our room had what seemed like a cigarette smoke smell lingering, but we figured out that it was just the heater. Only down side.",4,2015,01,27
202,Very good and convenient hotel,"We stayed at the Westin for a long weekend, and it provided a typically Westin experience having stayed at the chain in other cities before. We had a Deluxe room and it was lovely. Very high quality furnishings, amazing bed and a great bathroom. Our room was on a high floor overlooking Trinity College (as requested on booking) and we had no noise issues as Temple Bar is on the opposite side. 

Location is great to be able to walk everywhere, right in the heart of the city. Also good for public transport as it's in the middle of the main one way system where every bus seems to go. The DART train station is a 5-10 minute walk away for venturing out of the city centre as well. We used this to go to Bray (for Powerscourt) and Malahide rather than going on an organised tour. Much quicker, since they're both within 30 minutes via DART. Fare was covered by the Visitor LEAP card, which also covered bus transport to and from the airport, which dropped off a few minutes from the hotel.

We didn't have any meals at the hotel but the afternoon tea in the Atrium Lounge was amazing. In fact, we went back again on the next day! Had both the traditional and peculiar. If I was to go again, I would only get the peculiar. Not that the traditional was bad by any means, but it is pretty standard fare among most British/Irish hotels of this class. But highly recommend the peculiar and would consider going back to Dublin for it alone. 

On the downside... I don't understand the high charge for wifi by this (or in fact any Starwood property) when almost all the other chains and even independents provide it free. However we had free data roaming in Ireland through our mobile provider (3 UK) so didn't need to use it. And there is a Starbucks next door for free wifi if necessary anyway.",4,2015,01,27
202,Great Hotel and Location,"I stayed at this hotel in January of 2015. The room was high quality. It was spacious and also the bathroom was large. The staff was quite friendly and welcoming. The hotel also is not too far from certain hot spots like the temple bar region. It is a nice little walk there and not too far. The breakfast here was also quite nice, there were a lot of choices in the buffet. Another nice feature was the Mint Bar downstairs. Great drinks and service there and they had live music when I was in town which was great. I would definitely stay at this hotel again if I was in Dublin and I would recommend that you give it a shot for either a short or long stay.",5,2015,01,26
202,Amazing Hotel,"My boyfriend & I stayed here in December. Had such an amazing stay here. Service was second to none, rooms were huge, luxurious & so comfortable (we upgraded to a Junior Suite).  All of the staff were so courteous and helpful. I will most definitely come back & stay again.",5,2015,01,23
202,"A very ""nice"" hotel. Nothing special though.","I checked in with my husband for a treat. Check in staff were very friendly and offered to make dinner reservations etc. The room was very nice but no better than any 4 star and even some Irish 3 stars that I've been in. I'm being picky, but only because I have wanted to stay in the Westin for a while. The drawer where the glasses and kettle pull out from could not be opened because the bed is in the way. This resulted in us drinking wine from the bathroom tumblers!!! The bed was beautifully comfortable. The air con was noisy. The bathroom air vent sounded like a plane taking off and was absolutely thick with black dust. My husband had requested a bottle of champagne be left in the room, this never arrived. Wifi is ‚Ç¨15! I think a five star hotel charging for wifi is absolutely out of order to be perfectly honest.
The Mint Bar was lovely, bar staff very helpful and efficient. 
I wouldn't stay here again, as I don't feel it's worth the money where other hotels certainly are, but it's a perfectly nice hotel.",4,2015,01,23
202,Location Location Location,"I stayed in this hotel for a week while being on business trip to Dublin. As many other reviewers mentioned it‚Äôs located in perfect spot. Close (walking distance) to all main tourist attractions, most of the cross Ireland daily tours starts in bus station located just 3 minutes walking distance away, the 10 minutes‚Äô walk distance to train/tram stations. The hotel has perfect breakfast buffet, good signal quality WiFi and nice and clean rooms, the ATM is just outside of the hotel.

My main concerns with hotel were as following
1.	I was not able to check-in early (10 AM), was waiting till 3PM to check-in
2.	The rooms run small",5,2015,01,22
202,A perfect place in central Dublin for a lovely relaxing lunch,A few years back a friend told me that she always visited a 5 star hotel when she wanted to have a coffee rather than go to a coffee shop if she had time or was on holidays - I have taken her advice - so when I visit Dublin either for pleasure or on business I always call into the Westin to the Mezzaine where I have my pot of tea in the most pleasant of surroundings and the best service one could wish for. Yesterday I had lunch there and again it met to my expectations. And the ambience there is so serene. Also a perfect place for business meetings or to catch up with a friend. Some time into the future I look forward to an overnight stay there thanks to the warm service received from the moment you step inside the door,5,2015,01,22
202,Excellent central location and warm service,"We stayed here for several nights in the heart of Dublin. This central location is absolutely perfect for sightseeing, eating at restaurants, shopping, walking, etc. One of the main hop-on/hop-off bus stops was about a block away. Temple Bar was more or less across the street. Grafton st. shopping was barely a 5 min. walk.

We upgraded to a suite and the spacious room and Heavenly bed were a warm welcome after days of sightseeing. The amenities and items were standard Westin products. The smallish fitness center was more than adequate. The Mint bar in the basement of the hotel served excellent food and even better drinks. On the Saturday night, they had a small jazz band playing.

Service throughout was outstanding and the only shortcoming could be that there was no indoor pool or hot tub. But that is a very minor issue - this is an outstanding property in Dublin and the location and service make it top-notch. I highly recommend this hotel.",5,2015,01,20
202,Beautiful hotel,"Rooms are perfect, clean and luxurious. The Mint Bar is really nice and serve delicious cocktails.
Only negative would be that i accidently didnt choose breakfast when booking and had to pay over 40‚Ç¨ for buffet breakfast for two.",4,2015,01,16
202,Lovely afternoon tea,"An all round great experience, great service, great food, lovely surroundings and super cocktails/tea and coffees. We went on a Monday so didnt need to book it as it wasnt very busy. The service was fast and the food was just superb, the sandwiches were fresh and flavourful, the sweet elements were a little too sweet at times and lacked a little on some flavour but were still excellent.",4,2015,01,16
202,Great Stay,"I had a great stay at the Westin Dublin when in Ireland for a friend's wedding. The staff were extremely friendly and helpful. The rooms were great in a beautiful hotel. The location couldn't be better. The breakfast is small but the offering is great quality. Really can't complain about anything other than the hotel doesn't have a club lounge. Other than that, great experience!",5,2015,01,14
202,Can't wait to go back!,"A really top hotel. Very stylish, high-end decor. Good service, valet parking. Rooms very nice, comfortable bed, choice of pillow styles, good sound insulation from traffic, spacious bathrooms. Excellent cocktail bar (best hotel-based one in the country). The Atrium lounge is one of Dublin's hidden gems. We also loved that when breakfast buffet finishes @ 10:30, a breakfast menu is still available until 15:30 in this beautiful & relaxing space which allows for a lie-on in the morning. Good value for money and it is now our 1st choice getaway hotel for overnight stays in the city.",5,2015,01,13
202,Best hotel bed ever!,"My partner in dine and I headed over to Dublin for the weekend. We opted stay in the Westin for a change. The staff were very polite and helpful from the liveried Doorman to the receptionist who let us check in at 11 am.
The room was small but well appointed with a bed that was by far the most comfortable hotel bed we had experienced. The bathroom was a triumph of marble, but why do they never have decent sized bathtubs?
The Atrium would be a pleasant spot for a some tea and cakes but the Mint Bar in the cellar was a fun place on a Saturday night with a great live band and an impressive range of cocktails and some serious mixologists. Sunday check out at 3 pm was a real boon!
My only gripe is that a hotel of this calibre should have free wifi in the rooms.
Will we be back - yes but opt for a room on the outside if you want to get some fresh air.
",4,2015,01,12
202,TOP NOTCH. ,"I've stayed here twice on business travel in Dublin. Perfect spacious rooms. Great location to tourist attractions. So it's very busy right outside. Taxis and buses. But that's OK. That means you will easily get ahold of public transportation at a moments notice. So that's a plus. 

Food at this place is perfect.  Great tasting and plenty of it.  No complaints. 

Sorry no gym here worthy of my time.  It was kinda pathetic. Ha don't waste your time. 

Starbucks down the street. Plus. 

Huge Bar scene just minutes away.... can you guess which one? Temple Bar area folks.  Perfect for great restaurants and lots of Guinness to enjoy!   Ah love it. 

So basically this is a great place. 

Enjoy.

202,"Location, location,location......","My sister and I overnighted in the Westin Hotel just prior to Christmas to get into the festive spirit and soak up the atmosphere in Dublin.  Our stay was so much more enhanced and made memorable by our stay in the Westin.

From the moment I arrived everything went smoothly.  Jacqueline, the reservation agent on duty was very accommodating and intuitive.  She listened attentively to my requests and most importantly anticipated our requirements.  No request was to small.  We were upgrade to a beautiful room on the 4th floor.   It was extremely comfortable and well appointed.   A large spacious quiet room with very generous wardrobe space, a luxurious bed with 5 star bed linen, double doors leading to our very large bathroom all smack bang in the centre of our capital city at a very affordable price two days before Christmas!!!  Perfection!!!

The location of the hotel had played an important role in choosing where to stay . ... located as it is in the heart of Dublin enabled us to step / walk straight to the main shopping areas where we could shop till we dropped and kick back at night to enjoy the traditional Christmas cheer without having to worry about taxies home.

Having purchased some perishable goodies during our stay, the staff very kindly offered to refrigerate them for us for collection prior to our departure from Dublin the following day.

As our visit was so successful, enjoyable and affordable we have agreed that this particular jaunt is very likely to becoming an annual event in our calendar.

Remember its location, location, location particularly at Christmas.
 
NB. I congratulate the hotel on its environmentally-friendly practises, which I find very commendable.",5,2015,01,09
202,Top class,"Beautiful welcoming hotel in the heart of Dublin.  This hotel is imaginative, modern, casual, and thoughtfully embracing, all at once.  The rooms are sumptuous and accommodating.  A brilliant choice for exploring the city and returning to the charm that Westin delivers over and over again.",5,2015,01,08
202,"Great Staff, Great Location, Great Hotel","The Westin Dublin is awesome.  We went with our adult kids and we had the time of our lives.  The Hotel Breakfast was fabulous.  The property is top notch with beautiful furnishings.  We stayed in one of the suites with an upstairs Library/TV room - that upgrade was well worth the cost.  The location is perfect - across from Trinity College, near the Temple Bar area, 1 block from the River Liffey walking distance to the Dublin Castle, Christ Church, shopping areas and much more.   We had arrived from the US at 7AM and had a 3PM check in, the hotel staff did everything possible to make us comfortable by providing a place for to change cloths, clean up and made us as comfortable as possible.  They ended providing options for early check in as well.  I highly recommend this property.",5,2015,01,07
202,If you are coming to Dublin - this is a MUST,"I do not normally 'rave' about hotels, but this one is a must. Beyond the obvious of this being a great location, its a BEAUTIFUL hotel with AMAZING customer service. 

My husband stayed at this hotel for 3 weeks on business and I wanted to send him chocolate covered strawberries as a little 'i love you reminder' and they had it done for me within 2 hours (hand written version of my note even!), the price was extremely reasonable too.  When I visited him for a few days, we needed extra bottled water and they just gave it to us. 

Everyone is so friendly from the doormen to the housekeepers. If I go back, I won't stay anywhere else!",5,2015,01,06
202,Top of the LIne,"The Westin Dublin is probably a cut above all the other Westin hotels I have stayed at in Europe, which is a significant accomplishment because the others are great places in their own right.  Check-in was fast and efficient, staff is extraordinarily pleasant.  Little things like pre-reserving a taxi to the airport mean a lot, as well as the functionality of the room with regard to modern communication.  The outlets for charging your e-items are right there on the desk, no need to search the floor for plugs.  The decor is great and the bar serves the best wines and snacks I have had in quite a while.  The hotel is also conveniently located near all the shopping meccas in town.  Great place to stay. I'm going back!",5,2015,01,05
202,"great location, big rooms and well restored building","We really enjoyed our experience at the Westin in Dublin.  The rooms and bathrooms are huge for European standards- the bathroom even has a separate bath and shower!  The heavenly bed was such a great treat for weary jet lagged travelers! The building is very well restored and has some great character.  Good central location to shopping, Temple Bar, and central Dublin. Only complaint is the somewhat suspect restaurant recommendation by the concierge- his recommendation was the only meal we did NOT enjoy in Dublin.",5,2015,01,05
202,Wowwwwww,"Can only say good things about this hotel, everything is great , bedrooms, bar, location, staff cannot do enough and very courteous. Only one slight comment would 'be the price of food however cannot wait to revisit this year !!!",5,2015,01,05
202,Perfect location,"Lovely large room with the most comfortable bed. I would recommend the Mint bar down stairs for a few pre dinner drinks, nice atmosphere and friendly service. Hotel was excellent location, directly across from temple bar and a few minutes walk from trinity college as well as other landmarks and a great selection of shops.   I would highly recommend the traditional Irish breakfast at the quays bar in temple bar, great food.",5,2015,01,05
202,Faultless,Thank you Westin for a very enjoyable stay. Excellent cocktails in the Mint Bar with very welcoming staff and a very high standard breakfast (at 1pm!)in the Atrium lounge followed by a 3pm checkout from a room with the most comfortable beds is why you should stay here if you feel like treating yourself when in Dublin. Keep up the great work.,5,2015,01,04
202,Very nice place to stay,"I found a nice package deal and booked three rooms for our party of 5.  We stayed from Dec. 27 - Jan. 2.  When we arrived they only had double beds which caused a little problem initially but it was fixed the next day.  Nicola was very helpful and apologetic.  Each of the rooms were spacious and had all the basic necessities required.  The bathrooms were large and well maintained.  I loved the oversized tub along with the large shower.  My room looked right into the office building across the lane which wasn't anything special but not all the rooms can have a lovely view.  The other two rooms either had an inside view of the interior sitting area or a view of Trinity College.  All were fine.  The front desk was great with any questions.

We used the concierge for trip planning and he set us up for the next day with a great day trip using Wild Rover Tours.  When we got on the tour bus they had our seats reserved for us.  I was thrilled because I didn't want our group to get split up.  I had never used the concierge service before but this was the time to use it.  Great tour.

Check out was a snap.  Little mix up getting a taxi to the airport but it was fixed immediately and we were on our way within minutes.  Overall, the Westin was a very nice place to stay.  It was close to everything and we walked to all sites.  The Zoo was a little far but we got our workout that day.

O'Briens across the street was a great place to pick up breakfast and the next to that was a main street to Temple Bar.  Lots of places to eat.

In the past I stayed by Christ Church but this is a much better location and the availability of restaurants is much better.  I'd stay here again in the future.",4,2015,01,04
202,Nice stay,"Very well looked after.
In a middle of the city.
In a shopping area.
Breakfast very good fresh coffee and juices .
Pancakes was tasty. 
Room clean and comfortable
Highly recommend to anyone for easy and relaxed stay. ",5,2015,01,02
202,A Very Special Treat in The Heart of Dublin,"Wife and I stayed here for 1 night as a gift from her brother. Brilliantly run hotel, excellent staff and good rooms. Food and drink in the Mint bar are excellent and not too pricey for a 5 star downtown hotel. Lovely warm atmosphere in there too at lunch and in the evening before dinner and for night caps before bed. Room was an average size hotel room well kitted out and spotlessly clean and very quiet despite the big wedding going on in the Banking Hall downstairs we heard nothing once we closed our door. Breakfast buffet and al-la-carte menu was really good we sat with a view up O Connell street. A rare treat but one we'll be definitely be coming back for",5,2015,01,02
202,Great location but a few issues,"Have stayed here a couple of times now.  Both rooms have featured a large corridor which build your expectations of a large room.  Bathroom is also large but the room itself is average sized Could they have made a better use of the space?  Have had an internal room and one overlooking Trinity and both were quiet.  The twin room was bigger than the double.  Rooms not as dark as I would like - there was a lot of light emitted from the back of tv.  The bed was comfortable but there are a lot of things on it - 2 sheets and 2 duvets.  There were no covers on either of the duvets so do they change the duvets after each stay? 

We didn't have breakfast included and debated going out for food but after phoning reception to establish what time breakfast finished, we ate in the hotel.  At 10.05, reception said breakfast finished at 10.30.  When we got the the restaurant 2 minutes later, they said they closed at 10.  Eventually they let us eat and breakfast was good - one of us had the buffet and the other had scrambled eggs from the a la carte which were really good.  

Parking was a bit of an issue for us but was resolved efficiently.  The room was booked through the spg website and we had requested a parking space.  When we arrived the car park was full and we were told we should have booked a space.  We showed them our booking but were told that we should have rung the hotel beforehand.  But the concierge was great though and told us to park at a car park in Temple Bar and we got our ticket stamped so that we paid the hotel parking price.

Overall, the hotel is in a great location in a lovely building but I've stayed in better hotels in the Starwood chain with less pretentions to grandeur.  If I was paying the full price, I would expect better.  A few minor tweaks would sort out a lot of the issues",4,2014,12,31
202,Their breakfast is worth the price alone!,"Our first two nights of our trip to Ireland we stayed here. What a way to kick off the trip! The rooms were awesome, The Mint is a GREAT bar and has delicious food but the breakfast alone is worth staying. When I say breakfast, this isn't just yogurt, bagels/toast and fruit. I'm a foodie and this blew me away. From the best scrambled eggs I've ever had, a charcuterie board, pastries, cheeses that will blissfully make your taste buds sing and coffee so good you'll never want to leave. The service feels like you're eating dinner at a top notch restaurant. Bernardo was so helpful in making suggestions for us newbies to Dublin, I wanted to take him around as our own tour guide! If you're waffling on choosing a place to stay, look no further. This is it!",5,2014,12,30
202,Always a great stay at the Westin. ,I prefer to stay at The Westin but it isn't always available and sometimes the price is not what I want to pay. But if you want consistent service and quality in any country then I suggest a Westin property.  You'll sleep like a b as baby.,5,2014,12,29
202,excellent,We have found the Westin Hotel by Tripadvisor and we have booked the room using booking.com. At the arrival instead of a double bed room the only available room  was only a double bed room! The problem has been brilliantly solved by the manager (an Italian gentleman of Trieste) and since then everything has been really pleasant! The location is perfect! Near the Trinity College and Temple bar area! Breakfast  at the Atrium Lounge has been lovely! All things have been positive!!! To be absolutely recommended !!!,4,2014,12,29
202,"Brilliantly located, comfortable haven","Staying with wife and daughter and son-in-law to visit his family at Christmas. Hotel every bit as good as last time we stayed. Because we were visiting family we only used the Mint Bar and the Breakfast Restaurant, both of which are very good. We also got the concierge to book us a taxi to the airport.
Excellent service from all the staff we dealt with, very helpful and pleasant. Service in the restaurant very good and high level.
Quite an expensive hotel, but reasonable value given its location and overall quality.
If you want a memorable weekend or short stay in Dublin this is an excellent choice of hotel.
Would I recommend it? Certainly!",5,2014,12,29
202,Great experience,"As first time visitors to Dublin my wife and I enjoyed the comforts (and great location) of the hotel, and we relied on the knowledgeable staff for suggestions for seeing the city and the region.  Our room met and exceeded expectations and the food options proved to be great choices.  We would return again, and we would recommend the hotel.",5,2014,12,28
202,Still waiting to hear back from the manager ,"I've been going to the basement restaurant in the Westin for many years and it's traditionally been a great spot. However there has been a change of late. The menu has evolved - prices up and standard of food down. And when I went there with a friend last week the service was slow. There was a new waiter who was clearly learning and one of the Original staff. When it came to pay there was no one in the restaurant and after waiting 10 mins I popped my head in the kitchen door. The original staff member was making Irish Coffees and the trainee was having a chat with him. So I politely asked if I could pay and was impolitely told they would be with me when they could. So another wait and eventually I was given my bill. No apology just a stroppy bar man who slapped my change on ye counter with a comment 'your change'. No sorry, thanks or goodbye. I went to the hotel manager on my
Way out to make a complaint and he agreed to get back to me. Almost a week on I'm still waiting.... In summary a fancy hotel with a fancy name but missing quality, service and customer care. Avoid avoid avoid. ",1,2014,12,27
202,The best bed I've slept on!,"I was in Dublin for a wedding on the weekend and the reception was held at The Westin, so my husband and I thought we would treat ourselves and stay the weekend. The hotel is a little costly in comparison to the rest of Dublin, but it was worth it!

The hotel is beautiful and the bedding is amazing! The best sleep we have ever had. To top it off, there is also a great cocktail bar (The Mint Bar) downstairs. All in all, a great stay.",5,2014,12,23
202,I will be back for sure.....,"Understated, cosy reception, very international staff offering efficient service. Nice bar in the old bank vaults. Breakfast was good quality with plenty of choice. Beds and pillows notably comfortable. Clean and well located. Only minor annoyance was no free wifi in rooms, only public areas. Overall, enjoyable and recommended. ",4,2014,12,21
202,Surprise Return,"Recently stayed here overnight once again.  This time we spent time in the Mint bar.  Sadly it did not meet the standards of the Atrium which I adore.  Cocktails were good, staff pleasant, but lacked atmosphere especially for this time of the year.  Room was to the usual high standard and I did enjoy my stay!",4,2014,12,21
202,Booking debacle in restaurant,"We decided to avail of the Christmas meal in the Westins Exchange restaurant. Because of the time of year etc. we enquired with about 2 weeks to spare. We were looking for a table for 4 on Friday 12th. Dec. 2014. We were contacted by the reservations person, who confirmed by email our booking for that evening. A few days later we received an email from the ""Christmas co-ordinator"" to say that we could not have that day or time. We were offered Saturday 13th, at the same time. We reluctantly agreed to this despite having to change other arrangements.The strange thing was, the reservations person had c.c.d the ""Christmas co ordinator"" when confirming our original reservation. Then to our total dismay, after all this, when we arrived on Saturday, the restaurant had NO RESERVATION! for us. 
Luckily, there was plenty of room in the restaurant (I wonder why?)

The meal itself was very pleasant and the service efficient and friendly, with just one exception. One of our party went out the the bathroom after dinner was served. A waiter took her dinner to ""keep it hot... Very nice,... except he completely forgot to bring it back, until followed around the restaurant and reminded.
Quite a bit to learned on customer service and relations I'm afraid.",2,2014,12,19
202,"Wonderful stay, relaxed christmas break","I organised a conference at this hotel and nothing was too much trouble they were always there on hand but not intrusive.  The reception was very inviting and the atrium for afternoon tea was suberb.

The conference room and meeting areas were first class.

The beds were so comfortable wish I had more time to sleep",5,2014,12,16
202,Wonderful! Great location and lovely hotel.,"We booked at very short notice (arriving 15 minutes after booking online.) We were warmly welcomed and our room was ready. The rooms are beautiful furnished and the bathroom was lovely. The bedding, toiletries etc all very high end exactly what you would expect from a luxury hotel. You are walking distance of most areas and on the door step of the Temple Bar area but not actually on it so you don't get bothered by noise. The breakfast is good and the waiting staff very friendly/chatty. We would stay here again and recommend it to anyone wanting a little slice of luxury in Dublin. ",5,2014,12,14
202,Terrible stay- Disappointing  Westin experience,"We stayed here for 4 nights and I can honestly say that the only thing going for this hotel is it's location. It is a disapointment to the Westin group and by no means a 5 star experience. Front desk staff lack interest and come across as unhelpful and rude. For example,  I asked about making a lunch reservation at one of the restaurants- the response was that she ( the front desk agent) would have to ring around each one to check availability- clearly too much effort!! On check in, I was told to read the information in the room about special offers relating to housekeeping. I was aware that there was a green policy in place for housekeeping from previous stays at Westin hotels. However, there was no information in the room so we didn't avail of it on day one. It was then placed in the room the second day ( sloppy housekeeping). We asked the concierge where D'olier Street was ( it was just behind the hotel) and his response was that he couldn't think where it was!!!!! Interesting response from an older man who appeared to be Dublin born and rared! The fire alarm was activated at 230am on one of the nights- this was not a problem as it is a safety issue. However, 3 PA's were made to cancel the evacuation which made no sense! The lady making the address got her words mixed on the 3 occasions- unprofessional and embarrassing! The room was pokey with one small window. The tv was so far away that the remote didn't work from the bed making it difficult to watch. The room had a thick film of dust behind the lamps and clock- it had not been dusted in months!! There was only 1 robe in the room so I called housekeeping for another. It disappeared the next day and was not returned.  On the plus side, the staff in the Mint bar were friendly and helpful. 
I will not be returning or recommending unless you specifically want location. The hotel is an embarasment to the Westin group. Suggest some basic customer service training as a start followed by thorough housekeeping! ",1,2014,12,13
202,Excellent location and service,"The location was excellent - we did not need to take a taxi anywhere (aside to and from the airport) as everything was within walking distance. 

The room was very comfortable - amazing bed, big bathroom with nice toiletries, there was a plug for US devices. Most importantly, all of our needs were met and attended to very quickly - first our fridge was cleaned out so we could store leftovers and then a mini fridge was promptly sent to our room upon request when we realized the mini bar fridge was not very cold, a vegan meal upon request at the Exchange restaurant and extremely good service at the restaurant. 

The staff and concierge was very attentive as well - we spoke with Jackie, Neil and Lazslo, who were all helpful and had good suggestions that we took and were pleased with. We also signed up for the Starwood membership (which was free) and were able to receive free wi-fi as a result. 
 
Also, if you pick the green option and decline housekeeping service, you can receive Starwood points or 5 Euro off per night at the hotel restaurants (up to 5 nights in a row). We would have picked the green choice regardless and this was a nice bonus we didn't know about.",5,2014,12,13
202,My favorite in Dublin!,"Great location, love the ""Heavenly Bed"" and white tea & aloe scented toiletries.  Excellent service.  Loved the two bottles of water they provided each night too.  I had a ""corner"" interior room that overlooked the atrium, and liked that the room shape wasn't a ""box"" and different.  Quiet, no street noise.  Even got to watch my NFL Seahawks game on the SkySport stations on the TV!  Will pick this hotel first for future trips to Dublin.",5,2014,12,10
202,Excellent city center location,"Very nice hotel, excellent location, across the street from Trinity college in the center of Dublin.  Walk out the front door to tourist attractions, shopping, restaurants, pubs, etc.  Well appointed spacious room, large bathroom.  Breakfast was included, and it was delicious.  Good staff.  Concierge was helpful.  If you are looking for an upscale hotel with city center location in Dublin, then this is as good a choice as any.  I would stay here again.",4,2014,12,09
202,"Absolutely abominable service, and very average food‚Ä¶","I have visited the Mint Bar dozens of times over the past year or so, meeting both friends and clients there. But not anymore. Not after my most recent visit. 
 
Recently, I met a friend there for Sunday lunch. I arrived early, and ordered a main course. My friend arrived after me, and ordered his food about fifteen minutes later. In the meantime, I ordered a large bottle of mineral water from the waiter, an Argentinean (I know his nationality because I had asked him some months earlier in the bar where he was from). Now, bearing in mind that this is a five-star hotel, you would be forgiven for expecting the service to be at least passable (this is Ireland, where one learns to be realistic as regards service). But the waiter didn't even bother to ask whether we would like to have the water now or later. Instead, ten minutes later, he arrives back with the bottle and two glasses. He plops the unopened bottle down on the table, with the glasses, and leaves. Basically, we have to serve ourselves. 
 
My lunch arrives, a decidedly average chicken Caesar salad. Meanwhile, my friend‚Äôs beef dish has not yet arrived. As I finish, the Food and Beverage Manager (who I will refer to as KB, the initials of the name on his badge) arrives and whisks away my plate, as well as the salt and pepper shakers. His manner in general is abrupt and unwelcoming. My friend says, referring to the salt and pepper: ‚ÄúCould you leave those here please? I will need them when my dinner arrives.‚Äù KB gives my friend a dirty look and snaps back superciliously: ‚ÄúI take it you mean these?‚Äù My friend nods. KB walks away with a disdainful air. ‚ÄúLook at him,‚Äù my friend says. ‚ÄúPoncing around like a Commandant in a concentration camp.‚Äù The description was apt. Ja voll!
 
My friend‚Äôs beef dish cost a hefty ‚Ç¨25, and turned out to be very average.
 
Meanwhile, a friendly American couple‚Äïfirst time in Ireland, they tell the Commandant‚Äïhave a query about where to watch sports. Well, the verbal floodgates open and the Irish blarney gushes forth, the Commandant all honeyed vowels and hospitality syrup. Meanwhile, us regular customers, us plebs of the old sod, can take the scraps as far as basic levels of courtesy are concerned.
 
On leaving, we made a detailed complaint immediately to the ‚ÄúDuty Manager‚Äù (for which, read: trainee). He assured us he would be back to us ‚Äúshortly‚Äù with a full reply. That was over a month ago. Since then, not a dickeybird. 

Customer service. Says it all, really‚Ä¶",1,2014,12,09
202,Can't wait to stay here again,"The Westin is in the perfect location right next to Trinity College and in the center of Dublin.  The staff is exceptional!  Uncle Peter ( legendary doorman),concierge crew  and front desk staff were very helpful in recommending day trips as well as local hotspots. We were on the 3rd floor facing the busy street and I couldn't get over how quiet the room was at night.  The bathroom was spacious and beautiful. The staff emptied the refrigerator in the room so we could stock it with our own fruit and beverages.",5,2014,12,06
202,Fantastic,"The Westin is excellently located right in the city centre. The hotel itself is beautiful, and looking lovely and Christmassy with Christmas trees and open fires. When I checked in, I was really impressed with the friendly welcome I received and this continued throughout my stay will all staff going out of their way to help and always with a smile.

My room was generously sized and the bathroom was gorgeous with a huge rainfall shower. Ask for a room on the quiet side of the hotel, I had no problems sleeping.

Breakfast was delicious, an excellent choice of hot and cold with fresh juices, tea and coffee.

Next time I visit Dublin, I will definitely be returning to The Westin!",5,2014,12,05
202,"If you're short on time in Dublin, this is the perfect location!","We had a very short stay in Dublin; Friday night to Sunday morning and we couldn't have picked a better located hotel!  We were able to walk everywhere and covered all the areas we wanted to hit: Temple Bar, Grafton St., Trinity College, Dublin Castle, Chester Beatty Library, Christ Church Cathedral, Guinness Tour, St. Stephen's Green, .  If you have a short stay, this is the hotel for you!  

The staff here are really wonderful and were very helpful to us!  A great tip: as we were leaving, the hotel let us know they could arrange a car to take us to the airport for a flat rate (22 euro if I'm remembering correctly) and it could arrive in 5 minutes.  Wonderful news because our cab from the airport was 30 euro.  Thank you Westin Dublin!",5,2014,12,03
202,Understated elegance,"Visited with my mum for the weekend to celebrate her 70th birthday. Located next to the stops for the airport bus and city sightseeing buses. Easy walking distance into the centre and near to the shops and restaurants. We left the bags early and they were in the room when we came back. Staff were really lovely. Twin room was very comfortable. Will try afternoon tea next time we visit. Nice touch to be given a crystal glass of iced water with a glass on wine in the bar,",5,2014,12,03
202,1 night stay for night out and shopping,"Great location, close to both sides of the city - Grafton Street with Brown Thomas and Stephen's Green one way and Henry Street and Clery's the other way. 
Nicely decorated room with the most comfortable hotel bed I've ever slept in - nice big bathroom with separate bath and shower. Breakfast was very good with Bloody Mary's on offer, as well as a choice of fruit smoothies. I would stay here again.",5,2014,12,03
202,"A high quality hotel, the usual place I stay when in Dublin on business","This is a well managed hotel in a great, central location and you can walk to Dublin's financial district with ease from here.

Rooms are big and spacious, service is polite and efficient, beds are large and comfortable, and bath rooms are modern and nice.

Recommended when travelling to Dublin on business.",4,2014,12,02
202,Overnight stay,"I stayed here for one night and have zero complaints. 

The location is right in the middle of the city, one of the most central hotels in Dublin. They also have valet parking so you can just leave your car with them and its taken care of. 

Staff are attentive and the whole place is beautifully kept. Some extremely beautiful rooms in this old building. The bedrooms are also lovely, and must be sound proofed because I didn't hear any noise from the outside. Food is great too, though expensive.",5,2014,12,02
202,Amazing stay,"My wife and I stayed here in September, 2012 and had a great stay. The hotel is beautiful and in an amazing location. The rooms were very clean, updated and very comfortable. The staff were helpful and knowledgeable about the area and offered good choices for things to do based on the amount of time we were staying for. I would stay here again without hesitating. ",5,2014,12,01
202,Great Stay in the Heart of Dublin,"The Westin is a top notch property in the heart of Dublin.  The area around the hotel is quite busy, but once you walk inside it is very peaceful.  Staff is very helpful and rooms quite large and nice.  The Mint Bar is a great place to raise a pint after a long day.  The hotel is close to all attractions and should definitely be considered for any trip to Dublin.",5,2014,12,01
202,Wonderful Hotel,"The Dublin Westin does Ireland proud by providing the hospitality and friendliness Ireland is so renowned for.  Our room was beautiful, spacious and pristine.  My husband uses a wheelchair and the hotel went out of their way to be accommodating. We had a problem with left luggage at the airport and Ross, the concierge, was so helpful and gracious.  Thank you once again Ross,
you are a star!  The location of the Westin is perfect, an easy walk to everything.  Don't miss afternoon tea at the hotel. It is fantastic!  Our stay was a really lovely experience mainly
thanks to the wonderful staff.  Thank you",5,2014,11,30
202,Weekend break,"Stayed in the Westin for 2 nights over the weekend. Everything was great, nothing to complain about. Lobby is stunning, staff lovely and room nicely decorated and clean. The only negative with the rooms was I found them quite dark, and hardly any natural light could get in.

Not given the hotel 5 stars as I felt it wasn't quite luxurious enough for that, although we did just have a standard room. I'm sure the premier/more expensive rooms would be worthy of 5 star style.

Would definitely stay here again.",4,2014,11,30
202,Westin Dublin - Great stay,"My wife and I stayed at the Westin Dublin, it was the last destination in our 2 week tour across the UK and Ireland i.e. London, Edinburgh, Scottish Highlands and Belfast. I am a SPG platinum member and we were able to get an upgrade to a suite. It was a lovely hotel, our room was large, in keeping with grander hotels, and bathroom was also clean and spacious. This hotel provided excellent service throughout i.e. front desk, room cleaning staff, and the restaurant was very efficient for breakfast in the  morning. I stay at many SPG hotels a year in North America i.e. 30-50 nights a year. The hotel is situated in a convenient area where you can walk to the key nightlife areas and for shopping and touring through the day.

There are lots of things to do in Dublin such as: enjoying the nightlife i.e. restaurants and pubs. Its a really enjoyable city to walk thru both in the day and evening. We took the hop on hop off bus to get our bearings on our first morning and went to a few museums as well as to the Guinness brewery, which is quite an extraordinary tour.  Yes, we learned a great deal about Guinness beer and learned how to pour it (we are now officially certified!), but also it helped us learn more about the history of Dublin.

When I return to Dublin, we will be staying at the Westin Dublin.",5,2014,11,30
202,Wonderful place to stay in the heart of Dublin,"The Westin is a great place to stay, right next to Trinity College.  The hotel staff are welcoming, friendly and helpful and I felt they tailored their approach to my needs and knowledge of Dublin.  The rooms are very comfortable, with large, bright bathrooms and lovely beds.",5,2014,11,30
202,Birthday treat,"From the moment I arrived I felt like a vip. I was greeted by a really nice tall reception gentleman and I arrived early my room was not ready , all very fair, I said I would wait in the atrium which was beautiful, when my room was ready, he ce and got me. Informed me the room was ready and luggage was already gone to room. Later I went to room and wow , well worth the money, great bathroom, rain shower and all, room had all you wanted, even though the wifi was not free.later I went out to concert. After concert I went back to hotel and had a drink or two, it was my birthday, only to be served by more excellent staff. I had left my wallet behind me in the bar, which was returned to me as I had left it, great to see honest people. That night I had a beautiful deserts in the room as a gift from hotel. My sleep that night was like sleeping on clouds, great sleep and great checkout next morning. They have valets parking, well worth the money, overall a great special place to stay, central with great staff but a treatüòÑ",5,2014,11,27
202,My new Dublin favourite,"Stayed here over the weekend and haven't got a bad word to say about the hotel. The staff from valet parking, all the way to breakfast and room service staff were absolutely brilliant. Young crew but really friendly and helpful. The suite was stunning. Split level with bedroom and bathroom on one level with lounge area and balcony a few steps up. I've been looking for a new hotel in Dublin and I've definitely found it here. 
",5,2014,11,24
202,Gorgeous rooms,"I've just spent a weekend in Dublin celebrating my mums birthday and we loved staying in this hotel! The location is fantastic, so so close to temple bar, grafton street shopping and all the famous sights. Our room was lovely, had lots of space, the beds were very comfortable and the bathroom was huge!! On check in the service was quick and we got offered a late check out....such a great first impression! The front of the hotel was going through a bit of a refurb but it didn't matter, the rest of the hotel was gorgeous!! We will definitely be staying here again!!",5,2014,11,23
202,"Great location, great room","We loved the location of the property - super close walk to Grafton Street, Temple Bar, and Trinity College. It was close enough to everything, without being right in Temple Bar which we've heard can be very loud.

A very modern room with all of the amenities you would expect from a Westin, especially the super comfortable bed!",4,2014,11,19
202,Location Location Location,"As many reviewers have mentioned previously, the location of the property can't be beat. Trinity College, Grafton Street area, Temple Bar, etc. We had a room facing Fleet Street and the noise on a Saturday night can be loud, particularly when Ireland had just beaten South Africa in a rugby tournament. Nothing to complain about the room. A typical Westin room in Europe. We didn't eat at the hotel, but there are plenty of restaurants on Fleet Street and Temple Bar area. For us, it was the drive out of town to the airport that made the hotel so great. With all the one way streets inside Dublin, the fact you leave the hotel and immediately cross the Liffey on your way to the airport is priceless. By the way, we have found the GPS in our car not particularly helpful inside Dublin as it has asked us to drive into one way streets from the wrong direction and to make turns where there were no roads to turn on to. Took us quite a while to get to the hotel coming from the south of town.",4,2014,11,19
202,Wonderful location !,"The hotel is very well located, just opposite Trinity College. Everything is within walking distance. The room I had (on the 4th floor) was comfortable, spacious and - most of all - impeccably clean. Good service at the reception. The only drawback is the breakfast : nothing memorable and costly (but there are many caf√©s around the hotel).",4,2014,11,18
202,"Amazing CITY FULL of history, magical atmospheres AND delicious food.",THE Westin hotel is simply amazing. A REAL Gem in THE beatiful Dublin. From my room i enjoyed a WONDERFUL view. Moreover THE continental breakfast WAS delicious. The room was big And extremely comfortable. In a few WORDS i WILL BE a westin hotel guest in my next visit TO Dublin.,5,2014,11,18
202,Westin Dublin - Great Location,"Location could not be better, adjacent Trinity College with the River Liffey and O'Connel Bridge a stones throw away. Shops and restaurants are all around.
Warm welcome and quickly checked in...very nice room, all amenities and a very good bathroom and a very good nights sleep.
Took dinner in the Atrium Lounge which I have reviewed separately...a very good stay, staff are an asset very friendly and helpful in all areas...well recommended...",5,2014,11,17
202,Great location and beautiful room,The Westin Dublin is very close to the Temple bar and close to the Tara street station. So it was very convenient to travel to the suburbs also. The hotel room was stylish with classic feel. And the overall service was similar or better than other SPG hotels.,5,2014,11,13
202,nice hotel and location,pretty nice hotel felt like i was in boardwalk empire.. helps if you are starwood gold so you can get an upgraded room. location is good too close to all the bars. standard starwood quality here can't go wrong really.,4,2014,11,12
202,Fabulous hotel and perfect location,"I decided to try out The Westin Dublin on my birthday weekend a) because I had heard great things about it on previous Dublin trips and b) for its convenient location, within walking distance to several tourist spots including Trinity College, Temple Bar, Dublin Castle and much more. Since the prices online were not cheap, we opted for just a one night stay but we were very glad we did! I wrote to the manager to see if I could get a double bed because all that were left by the time we booked were two twin beds but he said that they were fully booked and apologized. When we came to check in around 10:30 or 11am just to drop our bags off so we could explore Dublin, the nice woman at the check in said that she could upgrade us to a room with city view and that had a double bed (I am Starwood Gold so that may have been part of it), so we were thrilled. She was super friendly and made the whole process very easy.

The room (#103) was cozy but had a spacious bathroom and a nice feel to it. It was very well decorated and luxurious and the bed was very comfortable. It faced south towards Trinity College, while not an amazing view, was definitely not bad. In the morning we had breakfast at the hotel restaurant which had a nice spread of foods and a pleasant view overlooking the street which we got an even better view of because we had a table next to the window. 

The only complaint we had was the Wi-Fi. Although we received it complementary with SPG Gold, it was both spotty and very slow at times in our room. While I cannot say if this is unique to Room 103 as I have not stayed in any other rooms, I would be very upset if I had paid for it and received the connection we did. We did not try the lobby Wi-Fi so I cannot say whether this was better although I suspect it was. Regardless, for such a nice hotel that charges for Wi-Fi, fixing the bandwidth and range problems should be a top and easy priority.

Overall, we had a fantastic time and can't imagine staying anywhere else in Dublin!",5,2014,11,11
202,Excellent older hotel in centre city Dublin,I stayed for two nights at the Westin just across from Trinity College in Dublin. It is an older building that has been completely renovated to bring it up to five star standards. My room was very comfortable with a large tub and shower as well as the soft terry bathrobes that are one of the things I require. The hotel offers a green option that permits one to forego housekeeping for short stays in return for SPG points.  On the first floor above the lobby (US second floor) is an interior atrium where afternoon tea is served. The basement contains a vaulted bar. Breakfast was included and I had a delicious bowl of Irish oatmeal. Service was excellent. ,5,2014,11,11
202,Fantastic hotel!,"Great location, very grand hotel, helpful professional staff, awesome rooms, divine smelling toiletries. Only downside was that there was no free wifi in the rooms. Most hotels have that these days. I would recommend.",5,2014,11,11
202,Great location!,"To start off the check in took 45 minutes! Was running out of patience! The girl then told us breakfast was on until 3pm on Sunday so we went down at 11am! But the buffet breakfast finished at 10.30am so it was menu order only no irish breakfast was on it??? There was 6 of us and we annoyed! But the restaurant manager couldn't have said sorry enough and made us all a full irish breakfast! He was fantastic! And so nice! He is a credit to the hotel! 
Our room was lovely and clean! Bed very comfortable! But we had no window to outside! It looked over the room for afternoon tea! I would stay here again but ask for a room that looks over the street!",4,2014,11,11
202,Good but lacking in some areas,"This was our second stay at the westin myself, my husband and our three children. We got a good rate on two rooms interconnecting which works brilliantly for us as a family. On arrival which was quite late as we had been visiting family I was a bit disappointed as last time the children were made a fuss of and given little bags with goodies in. Also there seemed a little confusion over the two rooms booked. The rooms themselves were once again fantastic, large clean rooms with the most comfortable beds. Toiletries were a bit basic for a hotel of this class. Breakfast was buffet style which was priced at what you expect at a hotel and was ok. Service wasn't great, only tea and coffee offered no body asked if we wanted to order off the menu, was presumed we would have the buffet which was annoying as my husband and I wanted eggs cooking and took ages to get any service, maybe more staff needed. Was also sat at couch seats the first morning which wasn't ideal with young children and also they wanted us to sit there again second morning but we refused and said we would wait for a table. There was also
Confusion with the cost, children should of been free for breakfast but we had to get this taken off the bill. No turn down service and housekeeping was minimum. this hotel is ok for when we stay with the children as the rooms work well for the price but when myself and husband stay in Dublin we will not return. ",4,2014,11,09
202,Archaic WiFi Policy,"This is a classy ""5 star"" hotel with a superb city centre location. We had a large room with a large bathroom and for the first time in over a month we actually had a toilet that flushed easily and a shower with a really good stream of water. Now the negatives. We had a ""city view"" room and what an exaggeration that was. There was a tiled roof about one metre outside our window and one had to stretch to catch a glimpse of anything other than the tiles. Then the archaic Internet policy where the free WiFi is in the lobby only. This meant that every chair, nook and cranny in the lobby and outside the Mint Bar was taken with people presumably accessing the free WiFi. Surely this is a thing of the past now and WiFi should be free for all (not just Starwood members)!!! Our checkin was very time consuming due to queues and the checkout was almost as slow (only one other person checking out!!!). By the way, the Concierge staff were marvellous handling all our questions/requests with ease. Only related 4 Star by me because of that archaic WiFi policy. We could hear voices and noises from adjacent rooms. We thought our phone was ringing but it was in the next room. Surely the ringtones should be lowere a little???",4,2014,11,08
202,Great location,"We have returned from an overnight stay at the Westin Hotel as we were attending a special event in The Banking Hall which we had been looking forward to. 

The hotel is in a great location only minutes from Grafton street. Check in was quick enough and the staff were friendly. The hotel is a bit of a maze trying to find your way around. We used the valet car parking which is ‚Ç¨25 per night. 

We were allocated a ""quiet"" atrium room, however as I suffer from sinus and need a room with fresh air, we requested an outside room and were put into a double room on the first floor overlooking Fleet Street. 

The room had a double bed but it was very comfortable - however you would expect a larger bed as standard in a 5* hotel. It was quite warm in the room even though we had the window open. The bathroom had separate shower & bath and the room had the usual mini bar, safe, kettle etc but no biscuits for tea and no turn down service and only 1 bathrobe for 2 guests ??

The meal in the Banking Hall was delicious, however we only had regular knives to eat our fillet of Beef dinner and had to request steak knives to eat as the regular knife wouldn't cut butter ! They should have provided steak knives on the tables as Beef was being served.

The Breakfast was typical buffet style, but the breakfast plates were cold and the sausages, rashers, eggs were only warm and appeared to have been in the warmers for a while. The croissants & pastries were hard & cold & didn't appear to be freshly baked and weren't very appetising. The staff were friendly & attentive but the breakfast food itself was poor and to be honest, disappointing.

We had a nice stay in a clean, central, comfortable hotel with friendly, attentive staff but it wasn't what I would expect from a hotel with a 5* rating - it was nothing special & would be slow to return there again. 

",3,2014,11,08
202,Fabulous Hotel and Excellent Location,This is a wonderful hotel. We got a really good deal through a travel website. Nothing was too much trouble and the beds were the comfiest I have ever slept in.  A great location just across the road from Temple Bar and Grafton St is just couple of minutes away in the opposite direction.  Would highly recommend this hotel. The staff are very attentive. There is a lovely cocktail bar in the basement. Our room overlooked the atrium and was really quiet. Loved Dublin - very lively bars and lovely people - would stay again in a heartbeat.,5,2014,11,05
202,"Location, Location, Location","My daughter was graduating from Trinity College Dublin and we decided to stay at the Westin, as it is 100m from the front door of Trinity. It's in an excellent location anyway, as it is across the street from Templebar (party anyone) and a few hundred metres from Grafton Street (shop 'till you drop).  So for us it was perfect.  My wife got a good deal on two rooms.  The rooms were fine, nothing to write home about and the breakfast was average.  The service was up to expectations. There is no parking, but an efficient valet service, ensures that your car is taken and parked and returned to you when you leave. ‚Ç¨25 a night. The WiFi was ‚Ç¨35 for three days, per room but I got that removed.  Who charges for WiFi nowadays?",4,2014,11,04
202,Great location,"Really nice hotel - comfortable small lobby, great greeting service, very helpful concierge.  We were upgraded to the incredible double-storied ""College Suite"".  Very short walks to the Trinity College, Temple Bar and the major Dublin sights.  The bar downstairs is quiet and we found it attentive and friendly.

One item to note is that we arrived very early morning after an overnight flight, and found the hotel entrance quite difficult to find in the dark despite its central location",5,2014,11,02
202,Very nice stay,"We stayed at the Westin for a nice weekend in Dublin. The hotel is exceptional, lovely decor and everything is well presented. The rooms have had a makeover (looking at the older traveller pictures) and it's been done very well. We stayed in a traditional room which over looked the college grounds. The room and bathroom were very nice and spacious. We had breakfast at the hotel and the quality of food was very high. The only bad point was that the breakfast was so popular you had to queue to get in for about 15 mins. Would stay here again upon returning to Dublin. ",5,2014,11,02
202,Great Way To Experience Temple Bar ,"Having visited Dublin a number of times, we were excited to stay at the Westin due do TripAdviser reviews touting the hotel's excellent location. We were not disappointed! The location is wonderful, directly across the street from Temple Bar, around the corner from Trinity College, and a 5 euro cab ride to the Guinness Museum/Factory.

The hotel is quite nice, well appointed and very cozy. From the fresh flowers daily and duel fire places in the lobby to the hardwood floors and warm colors. 

The staff is splendid, courteous and responsive. They were helpful at every opportunity, from recommending things to do, to proving last minute help with our TV, late room servicing and so on.

The room itself was also great. We were upgraded to a Jr. Suite, a term in Europe that can sometimes be misleading. But not at the Westin. The room was very large, even by American standards, complete with sitting area including a full-size couch and chair. The bed was very comfortable and the bathroom large with both a full size shower and tub. 

The one shortcoming of the hotel would be the food.  While not bad, it was not on par with other five star hotels we have stayed at. Generally speaking the menus are fairly limited. For dinner it was suggested by the staff that we try The Mint Bar, the hotel's beautiful, cozy subterranean bar & restaurant with a 1920's speakeasy feel. That's pretty much where the appeal ends. The menu is very limited and the food very unimpressive. The wait staff was friendly but not very efficient. I had read the Yelp reviews prior to going, and they we're not very flattering, but based on the hotel staff recommendation I thought we would give it a try. 

Room service menu is also quite limited and, again, execution not what you would expect from a five-star hotel.  

Breakfast at the hotel is served at The Exchange, the hotel's highly rated main restaurant (Yelp), also suffers from a limited menu, consisting of only four different items. We tried the waffles and egg sandwich. Both were good. 

The Sunday Irish breakfast, served at The Exchange, was very good, though again, it is preset with few choices.  Unlike The Mint, the wait staff is very good and and the spot. Cappuccinos were spectacular!

Overall a great hotel in an amazing location. Unfortunately the shortcomings in the dining category kept me from giving it a five star rating. If you decide to stay at the Westin, it's a great choice but I would look for other places to dine.",4,2014,11,02
202,Short Mid week stay,"Wow, what an exceptional hotel. Breakfast is something special. You name it, they have it. Smoothies to a Full Irish. Room was huge with great views of Trinity College, everything is a stones throw from the hotel, Temple bar is a 20 second stroll and all the best shops are less than a minutes walk. The staff are super friendly and make sure to hit the bar in the basement, The Mint bar if my memory serves me. I cannot fault one thing about my stay. I highly recommend it.",5,2014,10,31
202,Centrally located,"The rooms were very very small but the hotel is centrally located to reach all the main attraction of Dublin by foot. 
The hotel is pretty expensive but may be worth if one is interested in staying at city center.
Temple bar, Trinity college, all the big shopping places and main restaurants are at stone throw away. Even the Dublin castle is at walkable distance. 
Access to airport is pretty convenient via the shuttle buses which stop near the hotel.",4,2014,10,29
202,Very good hotel,"Very friendly staff, Atrium is very beautiful, Mint bar is atmospheric for a late nightcap. Food was good, beds comfortable and rooms spacious.
No pool though (most 5 * have a pool?)

Great location close to the museums, Trinity and shopping",5,2014,10,28
202,Brilliant hotel fantastic service,The best hotel I have reviewed.  Stunning customer service from the moment we arrived.  I could not fault anything with the hotel.  Extremely comfortable beds and a generous breakfast buffet.  Location right in the centre of the Dublin action.,5,2014,10,28
202,Love the Westin,"I travel to Dublin for work at least twice a year and always stay at the Westin! The staff are incredibly friendly and always remember me at checkin and at The Exchange restaurant (where breakfast is served). I feel right at home every time I stay here!

The Westin recognizes my platinum status and always gives me a junior suite upgrade. The rooms are spacious and clean (I believe the hotel underwent renovations about 1-2 years ago). The bathrooms are very spacious as well with a large soaking tub. The breakfast buffet is great with a lot of hot and cold options, plus fresh coffee and pastries.

The location is unbeatable (in my opinion). You're less than a 0.5 mile walk from Grafton Street (shopping), St. Stephen's Green (park), and the heart of Temple Bar. You're also very close to the IFSC (business center/Financial District) and right next door to Trinity College! 

Also, anyone looking to book a trip for St. Patrick's Day - the Westin is directly on the parade route!

I always look forward to staying here and would recommend this hotel to anyone! Business travelers, couples, and families!
",5,2014,10,27
202,Great hotel in a central location,"When we booked the room we understood that the Westin was in a historic building and we were expecting an older, worn look but when we arrived the hotel appearance exceeded all of our expectations. Great hotel, great service, quiet and in a central location to explore Dublin. We will definitely be back!",5,2014,10,25
202,Very Nice,I was pleasantly pleased with this facility. The staff were all eager to please. The writer rooms were warmly decorated and very comfortable. The hotel is in an excellent location. Convenient to everything. Overall exceptional quality for the price. ,5,2014,10,24
202,"Good location, but tired.","We stayed two weekend nights and both the general hotel and room decor seemed somewhat tired and dated.   

Strong scents in elevator bank from adjacent spa.

Awkward shower door location in corner room.  Good bathroom amenities.

Service was fine and location was great; only a half block from Trinity.
",3,2014,10,22
202,"PERFECT LOCATION, SERVICE and OVERALL experience","This is a great hotel ; location the best for Dublin; you can almost walk everywhere. We had an upgrade to a juniorsuite, which was lovely. Spacious and nicely decorated, flawless. Heavenly beds indeed heavenly. Check in fast, helpful and clear. Bathroom had a tub and perfect shower. Small problem with waterdrain was solved immediately. Breakfast was good except for most of the bread (most of the sorts rather ""dry"") and the cappucino and latte (which weren't hot)
Definitely recommend ""a most peculiar afternoon tea"". Make sure you have reserved for this.
Looking forward to come back. Booking stay months before visit can help to get good rate.",4,2014,10,22
202,Solid business hotel with old school charm,"+comfortable bed 
+friendly staff 
+everything worked 
+good location 

-rooms need a paint job 

Overall a solid business hotel. Nothing that will wow you, but you won't go home unhappy. If you get a good rate, this is the place to camp at. Location is fantastic. ",3,2014,10,20
202,FABULOUS STAY,"Unfortunately only a 1 night stay with my mum in Dublin at The Westin but what a great place to stay.  Location is brilliant, you can walk everywhere.  The rooms are very spacious and nicely decorated and the beds well they are so comfortable.  All the staff are extremely helpful and friendly particularly Nicola on reception - every recommendation she made we did and were not disappointed.  There is absolutely nothing I can fault at all - only that my visit was not for longer!",5,2014,10,20
202,"Excellent location, cool bar","We stayed for two nights, perfect location.  Everything in walking distance.  Rooms are comfortable, bathrooms spacious with both tub and shower - great water pressure!  We loved the bar - the bartenders obviously take pride in what they do and craft lovely cocktails.  They were warm and friendly, helpful with local tips.  There was a jazz band playing on Friday night that added to the cool vibe.",4,2014,10,19
202,Lovely!,"Out of all the places we stayed while on our travels in Ireland!! This was the place! CAN I SAY BEST BEDS IN THE WORLD!! Although we had to wait until 12:30 to get checked in after flying the red eye, the lady at the desk did her best to get us in, she was beyond friendly and helpful.... Love this place!!! Thanks",5,2014,10,16
202,The perfect hotel experience,"From the front desk to the room service, the club, the room decor and heavenly beds and linens..the staff, the location.. Perfect. True professionals in every way. This is what a hotel should be. I would recommend to anyone . ",5,2014,10,15
202,"Excellent Time in Dublin, perfect location, excellent staff","The location of the Westin in central Dublin is perfect! There is close access to most of the major sightseeing locations, Grafton Street, Temple bar, Dame street, etc. My wife and daughter had a proper tea in the afternoon and the staff told us which locations to visit for a good beer and some fun music (Against The Grain pub, on Grafton).

The front staff were incredibly friendly and courteous, as always. We were upgraded to a jr. suite and spent about an hour enjoying some wine on the patio that was accessible from the front room or our bedroom. The room was really awesome, nice big bathroom, huge walk-in closet and comfortable lounging area.

We asked for in-room breakfast one morning before we flew home. Room service was not open until 6:30 AM (the time we needed to leave for our flight). We asked on the room service card hanging on our door if we could have breakfast at 6:10 AM, it was promptly delivered at 6:10. Nice way to start a big travel day back to the states.

Definitely stay here again!",5,2014,10,15
202,Fantastic staff,"This hotel is great in so many ways.  It is located in central Dublin with great shopping, restaurants, nightlife  and sight seeing all within a short walk.  But what really makes this hotel are the staff.  Each time we needed anything the staff went above and beyond what you might expect. Great place to stay!",5,2014,10,14
202,Westin Dublin,"Great location close to airport and near trinity college. The location is great for visiting town. Walking distance to Grafton Street, Temple bar, and Dame street. The room was very comfortable with a nice bed and bathroom.",5,2014,10,12
202,Perfect Location,"Not only does this hotel have the ""Old Irish Charm"" but the staff are extremely friendly and helpful. The rooms are comfortable and clean. The location is right next to Trinity College and right in the middle of plenty of great sights and pubs/shopping.  I will definitely stay here when I'm in Dublin.  It's just an all around great hotel. ",4,2014,10,12
202,Excellent hotel in a great location!,We spent 2 nights at the Westin in June and were very pleased.  The room was very comfortable with a great bed and a nice bathroom.  Breakfast was good and the staff was efficient and professional.  The location is great for visiting the town and it took us only 20 minutes to get to the airport on a Saturday morning.  Very good option for Dublin.,5,2014,10,11
202,Location could not be better,"The building, located in college green was sympathetically restored to maintain the external historic architecture>opposite the old parliament and adjacent to Trinity College, it had to be. This is one of the better Westins. Valet parking is available at ‚Ç¨25/ night which for city centre is a bargain. Grafton Street, Dame Street and all of the Temple Bar haunts are only a stones throw away. I have stayed here several times, and between this and The Shelbourne there really isnt much other choice. The bar service late at night could be better... My only gripe. Get a suite if you can overlooking Northumberland. Soundproofed rooms, but fascinating views of Dublin life.",5,2014,10,11
202,great location,"Only one night at the end of our trip before the airport the next day - great night sleep and very helpful staff.  Did not eat there so I cannot comment on the food.  Concierge, doorman and porters johnny on the spot.  Front desk caused us little confusion with a transportation issue but all in all a great hotel.",4,2014,10,10
202,Nice hotel but a bit pricey,"This is a lovely hotel, staff are efficient but a little impersonal.  The bar downstairs does great bar food, the burger is excellent!  I was unfortunate enough to be given one of the rooms overlooking the interior of the hotel, a lounge/bar area.  No way of opening a window for fresh air!  Had I been staying for more than 1 night I would have asked to be changed.  If you can avoid these rooms then it's a good hotel if a bit on the pricey side.",3,2014,10,09
202,Great stay again!,"I have enjoyed this hotel on multiple occasions- no shortage of attentive staff or good accommodations. The tea service in the courtyard room was always a treat and the food is excellent. The gym is a bit small but the hotel rooms are well appointed and comfortable. Breakfasts were included and the service was friendly and impeccable. The concierge provided such helpful recommendations for dinner venues. The location was easy walking distance to most attractions including the Book of Kell. Overall, I would definitely stay here again!
The only thing was that I didn't stay the whole time I had reserved so they charged me the full legn of the stay. I wish that they could have",5,2014,10,06
202,A perfect gem of a hotel...,"This hotel has it all. Amazing location, amazing staff, and perfectly clean everywhere. We stayed here for 3 nights in May, and loved every second of it. The Westin Heavenly bed was to die for and made each night after a busy day just a dream to sleep in. There was an older gentleman at the door each day who was great to chat with and gave us great recommendations of where to eat that was near by. Close to shopping, hop on hop off bus stops, and Trinity College of course. Will go back in a heartbeat if given the chance. Only downside was no free internet.",5,2014,10,02
202,what a wonderful way to spend time in dublin,loved the service and attention .  we got in late and needed a snack  we went to the mint bar and they just made what we wanted right away.  the rooms are well appointed and so very cosy.   we lost our phone and they stayed with us the whole time until we got it back.... can't wait to return,5,2014,10,02
202,"Great Location, Superior service","From the Westin Heavenly bed to the lovely service this is a fine hotel. The location hear Temple Bar area and the other major sites is a real plus. Rooms with a street view could be noisy but the double glazing is quite efficient. As we toured through the rest of Ireland I missed the Westin bed the most, a really comfortable bed doesn't seem high on most Irish hotels list",4,2014,10,01
202,Business hotel,"We are SPG Gold and booked a Junior Writers Suite and were rather disappointed not to have been offered an upgrade.
The suite was as expected but probably not value for money at ‚Ç¨441 a night.
There were 24 hour road works taking place outside the hotel and the noise could be heard throughout the evening and night whilst trying to sleep.
The in house movie system had various faults which interrupted the viewing pleasure. The buffet breakfast was adequate but omelettes incurring a 6 euro supplement seemed rather unfair !
Generally the services offered were what should be expected although the concierge staff were not as attentive as we would have liked.
This is primarily a business hotel but the location makes it good for a couple of nights stay for visitors to the city as ideal to be able to walk to city attractions.
Good enough hotel - doing just enough.

",3,2014,10,01
202,smart place to stay in Dublin,"there aren t so many smart hotel where to stay in Dublin and the Westin Dublin is one of them. International level staff, clean and charming rooms, the hotel is not big, which is quite something nice to my ears.
The cocktail bar & restaurant is located in the basement which is quite weird as you don t have day light for lunch... the bar staff is devoted and very skillful for its cocktail... the food is tasty and well balanced",5,2014,09,30
202,Impressively welcoming hotel!,"Have been meaning to review the Westin Dublin for weeks.....so a long overdue review at last!
We spent three days at this hotel in August, and were very impressed by the facilities and even more impressed by the staff. We felt more welcome in this hotel than any other before (and we have stayed in many!); we loved all the small touches - the personal welcomes, the beautiful scented candles lit in the foyer each evening, the friendly cleaning staff, the genuinely helpful concierge etc etc. It is not an inexpensive hotel, but we found the location to be super-convenient and would stay there again in a heartbeat. Next time we would book afternoon tea in advance, as it is popular and we didn't get to try it on this visit.",5,2014,09,29
202,Really Great first impression of ireland,"found this SPG hotel a treat. service was really hospitable right through the organisation. Concierge, Front Door, Reception, Service Staff, Bar Staff, Breakfast Staff. everyone i had contact with was cordial and extremely helpful and supportive. they got me a room ready early on one of their busiest days of the year. as an SPG platinum i expect some extra help but they were special. room was beautiful and spacious. internet was fast. Water pressure in shower fantastic (rare). Breakfast was extensive. rooms were clean and well decorated. for an old establishment it looks like this place has been manicured really well. i was very impressed with this property and wish all SPG hotels were as good as this. apart from these great experiences the location of the hotel was probably best. for a tourist this place was in the heart of everything. i used points for this visit. my only improvement id make is to the lifts.....bit quicker! THANK YOU to all the staff. all very much appreciated.",5,2014,09,25
202,Wafer-thin walls let down an otherwise good hotel,"Spent 3 nights at the Westin. Great building, solid location.

Friendly staff on check-in, although incapable of sensing I was tired and unwilling to go through an up selling exercise or too many explanations.

Major problem was noise. My room had a door connecting to another room through which it's impossible not to listen to the neighbor's TV. The guest next door wasn't noisy. The room is just not well isolated.

A real pity when you have all other elements in place to have a good night's sleep. ",3,2014,09,22
202,West  never disappoints,"The Westin Dublin is in a great location to explore the city. Almost everything is within walking distance but if it is not, the buses are convenient. The staff goes out of their way to help and the rooms are outstanding with all of the amenities that one expects from the Westin chain.",5,2014,09,22
202,best of the best,"Had afternoon tea here, the food is amazing recommend the' unusal afternoon tea' which includes the victorian mojito. Beautiul building, and helpful hotel staff. Will visit again as first class service.",5,2014,09,22
202,Quiet  room nice staff,"I enjoyed all the amenities the Westin had to offer as i was a guest of my daughter ad spouse who traveled to Ireland with me for a week. My only complaint is a small one i guess but as most places  will offer complimentary coffee in reception  area this was a miss for them. Sat am we were leaving early checkout for  Dublin airport the Starbucks just a block wasn't opened till 0800am. I think the Westin should offer that to guests considering what the rates are. :-( We are used to our  breakfast at B&Bs and even French press is widely offered. Wonder if anyone agrees with this. The beds are really comfy...i found the staff very nice and helpful.
The upstairs lounge restful great for a quite moment, cocktail....",4,2014,09,19
202,A disappiontment in a great city,"We picked tis hotel because its close proximity to our daughter's apartment and because of the Westin name.  We stayed at this hotel 8 nights and I wish I could have given it a higher review, which is a pity because the basics were all there.  However the staff members made this a much less hotel than it could have been.

1. When we checked in the evening of the 6th of September, the receptionist who had a German accent told us that as SPG member we get 10% discount at the restaurants.  The next morning we invited our daughter and her boyfriend over for breakfast and spent over 80 Euro before service charges.  We were told the discount did not apply to the ground floor restaurant, only to the pub and bar, which was ridiculous, who would have breakfast at the pub or the bar?  i wish she had not mislead us, because there are many wonderful little restaurants serving delicious food in the neighborhood.

2. the same receptionist asked us what newspaper would we like, my husband told her Financial Times.  Lo and behold we had a 3 Euro charge per day for the newspaper.  It was never mentioned that there was a charge for newspapers, and our experience was that at international hotels of this calibre newspaper was complementary.  At least if it was mentioned to us we could have opted not to get them since we were quite busy and had no time to read them anyway.

3. The maid service was very erractic.  The first day we went out to the seaside town Howth early in the morning and returned after 4 PM, the room was still not made.  There was one morning I got out of the shower at 11:23 AM and saw a note from the maid saying that she had been here and the do not disturb sigh was on therefore she had done her duty.  I found it incredibly ridiculous.  If our room was not ready at such an early hours, she did not need to make an effort to come back mid-afternoon?  This is Dublin, the capital of a major western country and an international city, she never heard of jet-leg?.  I called the house keeping and eventually got my room cleaned.

4. Our sheets were only replaced every 4 or 5 days.  I understand the importance of conserving energy and water.  I had stayed at many top notch hotels and named international chains.  Normally they have a system for the guests to indicate whether they wanted the sheets changed that day, such as leaving a card on the bed.  Guests may not want to have sheets changed often, but I think we appreciate been given a choice.

5.  Because I was swindled by a taxi driver on my way from the airport who took 36 Euro for a 23 Euro ride, I decide to try to have the hotel book me a taxi on the morning of my departure.  It was agreed upon a flat rate of 22 Euro.  On the morning of my departure I was downstairs on time, because I had to straightened out the newspaper charges and minibar charges, I got into the car at exactly 7:03 according to the nasty driver's own receipt.  He charged me by the meter and when I politely mentioned I was told a flat fee of 22, he took my money anyway and dropped my 3 suitcases right in the middle of the road-an entire lane away from the curb.  I am disappointed that Westin would engage such hooligan to take guests to the airport.  Such a shame for such a wonderful country and great city.  Dublin does not deserve this.

Tips for future guests:

1.  Don't put anything in the mini-refrig.  It is electronically monitored, You move anything you get charged.  Even though it gets sorted out, still is unnecessary hassle, especially when one is on a schedule to get to the airport.

2.Down load Hailo app for your iPhone/android and establish an account, which is a bit like Uber.  That way every transaction is done electronically, no money changes hands and less chance of unpleasantness.  I saw my daughter hail taxis and everytime taxi came promptly and the drivers are very personable and pleasant.  I suspect unscrupulous drivers don't joint the ranks of Hialo because it takes cheating visitors out of the equation.

I truly believe Westin could be a much better hotel, perhaps the problem lies in finding hiring and training the right staff.  I am giving it a three rating because I am not ready to write it off just because the bad luck with some of its staff.",3,2014,09,16
202,"Upscale, Modern In Central Dublin","This upscale, modern design hotel is centrally located. The staff is professional, polite and helpful. Our room was quite large and comfortable. Arriving from a boutique hotel in London, the lack of warm, personal attention was noticeable. However, the Westin does provide excellent guest services, and cannot be compared to a 100 room property. The only negative comment I have is the wait staff at the breakfast buffet is not very attentive. The perform their jobs in a ""mechanical"" manner, without the same attention food servers usually show to patrons. I would equate their performance with very polite table cleaners, whose primary function is to remove soiled plates, rather than ensure the guest is pleased with the food and service. I would definitely stay at this hotel again.",4,2014,09,16
202,Great Location,"The Westin is centrally located, close to Trinity College, and walking distance (less than 30 minutes) to major museums, and tourists traps (I mean attractions), and even Bus stops.  If you do not want to pay 25 Euro for the cab ride (about 10Km) do not take the Airlink Bus, use Dublin Bus as it leaves you off closer to the hotel (5 min walk). The lobby staff was friendly and helpful, especially with directions.  I found Dublin not the easiest European city to Navigate. Our room had a nice tub and separate shower, and was spacious by EU standards.  The bed was *very comfortable, with a nice flat screen TV.  Our room was inward facing into a breakfast Atrium, so it was very quiet, but a bit cave like.  Lighting could be better in the rooms.  There were some aspects of my stay that truly annoyed me, such as having to pay for in room internet, (Free Wi-Fi available in the lobby) and a locked Minibar. It did seem like I was being nickel and dimed, which was very different than at other Westin locations.  This hotel seemed to cater to the Business stays rather than tourists.  I did not eat at the hotel, as there were plenty of places within walking distance that were much more affordable.",4,2014,09,16
202,Worth EVERY Penny,"We stayed at the Westin at the end of a 10 day trip through Ireland, and it was the perfect choice. The staff is amazingly friendly and helpful - and really knowledgeable about the area and choices to make in food activities, and especially tours. The rooms are beautiful, and a good size compared to most European City Hotels, and the location couldn't be better; you are just steps from shopping, Temple Bar, and Trinity College.",5,2014,09,16
202,Great location for Dublin,"Stayed here for two nights before visiting family in south Kerry. Great location right near Trinity College, Grafton Street. Close to Temple Bar. Walking distance to Museums and Leinster House. Room was pretty clean. Beds were very comfortable. Staff were pleasant and helpful. Food in restaurant was average. Would recommend this hotel to friends and family.",4,2014,09,16
202,Fantastic Location & Excellent Service,"I stayed for 4 days in Westin Dublin, during a conference travel to Dublin.

First, this hotel is right across the Temple Bar area, and is a central location for any tourist activities in Dublin.  The Trinity collage was right within walking distance, and was very convenient.

Second, the staff were very very courteous, and friendly.  Particularly, the restaurant staff were fabulous.  It only makes you enjoy the food and atmosphere more.

Third, it is a very charming building, with a facade that had character - not a mindless glass shell one sees in many modern hotels.  

This could be a great place to stay if you prefer walking around to explore Dublin downtown area.

As a single traveler, I enjoyed the room much, but it could get a bit cramped even for a couple.",5,2014,09,16
202,Great hotel,Beautiful building and the westin beds can't be beat. The breakfast wasn't great and they do make you pay for wifi and parking but the location is second to none (although it seemed like the better restaurants were a cab ride rather than a walk). I was disappointed that no one was at the door to take our bags but someone quickly ran out to grab the car and bags when we walked in. If you stay here go to malahide or haute to get out of the city and get a great meal. ,4,2014,09,14
202,Great location for Dublin,"We stayed at the hotel on a trip with another couple in September 2014.  Beautiful hotel.  Great location.  It's near Trinity College, Temple Bar, Grafton Street, and more.  Easy access to sightseeing tours.  A great base for exploring Dublin.  The hotel itself is lovely.  The rooms are great with wonderful bathrooms and comfortable beds.  What the hotel lacks are any complimentary amenities -- free wi-fi, breakfast -- even fruit in the lobby. The fitness center is small.  The business center is two computers in a closet-sized room. The concierge arranged transportation for us to the airport, and the price ended up being 5 euro more than they had quoted, so we left Ireland on an unfortunate down note.",4,2014,09,14
202,Nice,Great location. Walk everywhere. In a beautiful old building lovingly restored.  Comfortable splendid service. Good breakfast restaurant nice bar. It's quiet and beds are Starwood style with lots of pillows and fine linens. Bathrobes in rooms along with the typical toiletries expected of Westin. ,4,2014,09,13
202,Great Location for First Visit,"This location is very central to all the central area landmarks, especially Trinity College and close to the departure point for many tours.  In a five day stay we needed no cabs or public busses, although we usually walk a lot.  We did use the hop-a-bus for local landmarks and the hotel sold us the tickets.  The major problem was street construction well into the night making it next to impossible to sleep for two of the nights.  We stayed in one day to try to sleep but the hotel itself was doing construction directly above our room.  Our room was quiet enough from normal street traffic, even on the second floor.  We found the breakfast staff to be wonderful and the Irish Breakfast very satisfying.  I highly recommend it.  The concierge was very helpful and housekeeping was very good.  The room was very clean and nicely decorated.  The front desk staff had a new team member who was a bit overwhelmed with the crush of early arriving customers but a manager got us in before check-in time and we thank them for that after a long flight. Hopefully the new gentleman got a bit of training in customer courtesy.   The Mint Bar downstairs was  a bit crowded but we ate their twice and the food and drinks were great.  They had live music the last night.

We would certainly stay here again but you may want to find alternative accommodations during the construction, which I understand will last into 2015.  

PS Dublin Airport has US preclearance which means you bags can transfer directly to any connecting flight on arrival in the US and, no lines in US customs after the long flight back.  Great benefit.",4,2014,09,13
202,Not reccomended for Americans.,"I visited 5 Ireland hotels all 4 or five stars. The room was great, spacious, and the bathroom was to die for. BUT this hotel charges for every little thing. Things that were complentary in every other hotel including parking and WiFi were extremely pricey and unexpected. Americans need WiFi in their rooms. If you want a hotel in a nice location (don't try to drive there during rush hour) or that has a nice room, this place is great. If you want basic services, I reccomend almost any other hotel in Dublin. ",3,2014,09,11
202,Irish Hospitality,We had a marvelous four days in Dublin due mostly to the grand accommodations at the Westin.  The rooms were spacious and the service was of the highest quality. The only thing lacking was a fine dining restaurant in the hotel.,4,2014,09,04
202,"Great hotel, great location","I spent 5 nights at the Westin Hotel in Dublin on a business trip and I have very good impressions!! The food was excellent, the room was clean and ""soundproof"" and the bars and lounges perfect. Only two things need improvement, the first being the size of the beds which were a bit small for two persons and the other the queues and the personnel at the reception which should be faster and more eager to serve.
Finally the location was perfect as you were within walking distance from the city centre and many places of interest.",5,2014,09,04
202,Great location,"We stayed at the Westin for three days in March and thought it was a nice hotel. The location was great -- near Grafton Street, Temple Bar and great restaurants. We arrived on the 6am flight from NYC and the staff was very accommodating and managed to get us into a room by 9:30am. The bed was very comfortable and we loved the bathroom. Comfortable reading chair and a flat screen television were nice also.  The hotel gym was small but well appointed. The hotel bar makes wonderful specialty cocktails. I would recommend this property. The only cons were that the hotel doesn't provide free Wi-Fi (which is pretty standard at most places) and our room was adjacent to another roof so we didn't have a proper view.",4,2014,09,04
202,One night in Dublin,"We stayed in the Westin on our way through to the South West of Ireland. The location of the hotel is perfect for anything you might want to do in the centre of Dublin. The staff were excellent, extremely helpful and always smiling. Our room was also very good, well equipped, a really comfortable bed, excellent bathroom supplies. If there was one complaint it was t he lack of a view from our room. Unfortunately our room was adjacent to another roof so all we could see was roof tiles.
We had room service at breakfast, the food was excellent and delivered with a smile.
We are planning on a return to Dublin and The Westin will figure highly in our itinerary.",5,2014,09,03
202,Really Great Stay,"We only stayed the one night, but it was really good, what a great location.  We had valet parking and as soon as we stopped outside the hotel, a member of staff was there ready to help us with luggage and take the car away.  Hotel staff were really pleasant and helpful.  We had a full Irish Breakfast which was just fantastic, and as the hotel is just over the road to Temple Bar, we had dinner over there at one of the many brilliant restaurants.  Although the hotel is in the centre of Dublin, there was very little noise during the night.",5,2014,09,03
202,Best location in Dublin!,"I have been to Dublin several times now, and I stayed at this hotel for new year. It was simply wonderful. The location could not be more ideal. in the middle of everything (but not a loud hotel by any means. You walk outside temple bar is in front of you, or you can turn left or right for wonderful sightseeing and shopping expeditions. 

The bar in the hotel is wonderfully oldy worldy style and classy. The rooms are clean spacious and cosy, couldnt fault it really rather than was a bit pricey but it was new year! 

I would definitely recommend and stay here again - magical.",5,2014,09,03
202,Great Hotel to stay in Dublin!,"My wife and I recently stayed at the Westin Hotel in Dublin.  What a great choice!  From the time we checked in to the time we had to leave the Westin Hotel Team took such good care of us.  When we checked in Nicola greeted us with a warm smile and made sure the check in process was seamless. 
George, Simone and other team players at the front desk made sure we were always well taken care of.
Amy, Caesar and the other restaurant team players made all of our breakfasts very enjoyable.  Peter and the others at the concierge desk made sure we had the correct directions to Guinness, Jameson and other important places in Dublin.  Then when we needed suggestions and directions for restaurants we had no worries.  
The Westin Hotel team in Dublin took very good care of us, helping us to enjoy our entire stay.
If you want a nice, comfortable and centrally located hotel in Dublin then you want to choose the Westin Hotel.",5,2014,09,03
202,This was a dreadful experience,"As I read the other reviews I wondered if we stayed elsewhere, or did they?  Our check in and baggage handling were slow but fine.  The young man who checked us in was difficult to understand with his accent but we did our best to follow him.  When we got to our room all the way down the hallway there was an overwhelming odor that no one could explain to us.  After the first evening I mentioned it at the desk and a young man said he would check on it and let me know, never did to my knowledge.  Our bedroom obviously had water damage on the ceiling in 3 places, water stains and paint patches which were not fixed. (I have photos of all of the rooms shortcomings) The bathroom was nasty.  The tile in the shower area was thick with mold and smelled awful.  The shower curtain was smelly and sour and clearly had not been changed in a long time.  The dirt around the faucets and backsplash were disgusting.  More disgusting was the urine odor at the toilet area and the yellow staining on the grout and flooring.  Had we not been anxious to leave in 2 days to go back home I would have ranted until we were moved to a cleaner better larger room.  This was an American Motel 6 and unacceptable. The food was not good either, I stuck to the pastries as they looked store bought and safe versus the runny eggs and overdone meats.  The concierge flatly told us there was no need to reconfirm our driver to the airport as there was never a problem with pick up.  We insisted and then a call was made to reassure us that our driver to the airport would be on time.  No recommendation here, would like to be compensated for a terrible stay.  And the wifi to our phone would never connect but there was computer access in an offside room.",1,2014,09,02
202,wonderful stay,"We had a great Starwood experience at the Westin, Dublin. The rooms are very tastefully decorated, the beds are ""Heavenly"" and the bathrooms were sparkling clean. That said, it was the genuine warmth, kindness and hospitality that all the staff members displayed to us that really made it a wonderful stay. We are truly looking forward to our next visit.",5,2014,08,28
202,Pros and Cons,"When writing a review, I like to show both the pros and cons of a place, but with the Westin in Dublin, there simply are no Cons to mention.  The location, the service, the rooms, the bed...all top notch.  It was such a pleasure to end our two-week trip at this fine hotel.",5,2014,08,28
202,Nice but pricey for Dublin,"Stayed for one night in August 2014 with spouse.
Great location very close to the famous Temple Bar area of Dublin. Very comfortable and spacious rooms.
Breakfast was below average for a vegetarian with very limited options.
Very pleasant stay‚Ä¶but very pricey for Dublin city.",4,2014,08,28
202,Great Location - A few Niggles Though,"Stayed here this past weekend. Location is great, public areas impressive, downstairs bar makes great cocktails. 

The room was HUGE. Amazingly comfie bed. Curtains do not block out morning light in the window alcove so i was woken by light every morning. The bathroom - great shower, huge space, but the bath is too small for the room and you are unable to stretch out in it - and I am only 5'10""! Only way to have even a vague soak was to stick my feet up the wall - not very comfie :(

Computers were down when we checked out - so still do not know what our additional charges were nor have i seen an invoice. Even though I was assured it would be emailed by the close of day.",3,2014,08,28
202,Please try harder,"I'm usually a big Starwoods fan, but the experience at this location was a bit on the annoying side, at least initially.  We chose to stay at the Westin in between flights on our return leg home.  After being ignored by the doorman, we dragged our luggage up the stairs to the check-in area (at which time we noticed the luggage ramp that was not pointed out earlier).

At check-in, I was not offered an upgraded room (no explanation was given, even though it was both a feature of my rate and my status).  I let it go, as the check-in agent seemed a bit overwhelmed (despite there not being anyone else checking in at the time).

The room was dark, musty, and cramped (though I thought the bathroom was nice).  The view was onto a courtyard, which was nice, but also faced other rooms (which required drawn shades most of the time).  Our television did not work, and even after calling the front desk several times, no one came to fix it (we gave up, considered it a sign, and instead chose an early night).  

Check out was fine.

I would recommend the bar downstairs - great music on Friday nights (jazz when we were there) and really top-notch staff.  

Would I stay there again?  Probably.  I believe in second chances, and my stay was certainly an anomaly based on past stays in Starwood properties.  Until then, I will have to rank as average.",3,2014,08,26
202,fabulous hotel,"we stayed here for a two night break, it is a gorgeous hotel with lots of features. Fantastic location to temple bar and the city centre. Staff were all so helpful
Food was amazing. The mint bar is so chic enjoyed a couple of cocktails",5,2014,08,26
202,Beautiful hotel in the heart of Dublin,"You could not ask for a better location to explore Dublin.  The hotel is historic and within walking distance to many of the sites, temple bar, trinity college, and the city bus tour.  The rooms are spacious and the service is outstanding.  I loved the cappuccino that they make in the exchange restaurant.  The buffet breakfast was very nice also.  There is a nice little bar on the basement floor, The Mint Bar,  where people go to try some outstanding cocktails.  It is everything you expect from a Westin.  I would definitely stay there again on my next visit to Dublin.",5,2014,08,26
202,bar service poor and very expensive,"very over priced 20 euro for a very small cocktail, small bowl of peanuts for 4 people, no atmosphere, poor service a very expensive visit 51 euro for a round for 4 people.
never stayed in the hotel thankfully",1,2014,08,25
202,Amazing stay,My boyfriend and I stayed in the Westin for 2 nights and had such a lovely time. The staff were all extremely helpful and the location is perfect!! The beds were probably the comfiest I have ever slept in. I would definitely recommend it!  ,5,2014,08,24
202,Central location and more,"Several attractions within 15 minutes walking distance given its location.  We had adjoining rooms with our kids on the top floor, and the rooms were spacious, well decorated with comfortable beds that one would expect from a Westin.  Aside from that the key to the excellent rating is the service provided by the staff which was top notch.  Everyone we dealt with were friendly, accommodating and attentive to our needs.  Even the folks who were there around 5AM to get us going to the airport were cheerful and upbeat.  Highly recommend and will certainly stay here again when in Dublin.",5,2014,08,23
202,Perfect Location,"What you would expect from a Westin - nice room, friendly staff.   The hotel is centrally located to all the attractions in Dublin....it is steps away from Trinity College and Temple Bar.  Only surprise was WIFI was not free.",4,2014,08,22
202,Great location,"We used points to stay at this hotel, which was our primary reason for choosing it, but the location is great - it's right next to Trinity College with easy access to Temple Bar and Grafton Street.  It's a Westin, so the hotel itself is nice.  We were in a library suite which was spectacular.  The hotel bar is fine although it's off the beaten track, so it's mainly hotel guests.  No big deal though since there are tons of great bars and restaurants nearby.  It's a perfect hotel if you want to be out exploring Dublin.",5,2014,08,21
202,awesome drinks,"We went in for a beer on Thursday but ended up having the most awesome drinks we have had on our trip to Ireland. The Staff where knowledgeable and well trained in the mint bar. The hotel was spotlessly clean, staff friendly especially the bar staff.
 We will definitely return to this bar and hopefully stay a night or two.",5,2014,08,21
202,Great hotel / location,Great hotel in Central Dublin. Very spacious rooms . Great staff .! my only bad point is that in 2014 a 5 star hotel should Not be charging for wifi . This would not stop me from staying in this hotel again .,5,2014,08,21
202,Great location and staff,"The hotel is located a few yards from Trinity College. A couple of blocks from Grafton Street and four blocks from the Temple Bar district. If you want to be in central Dublin, without the noise of the busy night life, this is the place to be. Rooms are relatively large for European standards. Breakfast is very good. Concierge help is limited.",5,2014,08,17
202,Not suitable for people with disabilities,"When I rang to book the room in the Westin I asked for a disabled room or fully accessible room for my brother who is completely wheelchair bound. I was told this wouldn't be a problem. However, upon arrival and after checking into the hotel we went up to the disabled room to discover that the bathroom had a bath and not a roll in shower as is customary for fully accessible rooms. I immediately rang down to reception and voiced my concern on the matter only to be told they would send up a stool for the bath as they have no rooms with roll in showers.

This wasn't acceptable. My brother is a fully grown man who cannot walk or lift or hoist himself in or out of precarious situations that a bath would cause and neither I nor my mother would have had the strength to lift him in and out of the bath. Life is hard enough without adding the extra pressure of an unadapted bath into the equation.

I told the staff that it wouldn't be suitable and was told that I could look at a room that had a normal walk in shower in it to see if that would be suitable. I obliged and was shown what seemed to be a very lovely room that would suit anyone who wasn't disabled. Again I explained it wasn't suitable, the shower cubicle was far too small and with a step up into the shower (no matter how small) the situation was impossible.

The girl I was speaking to was very lovely and very apologetic and informed us she would ring The Shelbourne to see if they had rooms (with roll in showers) we could book into, which luckily they did.

While the hotel is beautiful and the staff very friendly I cannot express how disappointed I was in this experience. It's 2014 and for a hotel to not have suitable facilities for someone in a wheelchair is beyond unacceptable. All I can conclude from this experience is that the Westin in Dublin is fostering an attitude of exclusion and prejudice for those among us who have disabilities. And I can say without hesitation that I will never stay in this hotel again and will advise those I know to avoid it in the future also, unless they find a way around the issue.",1,2014,08,15
202,"Great location, great staff","This hotel is situated in a great location for visiting various attractions and not too far I imagine from commercial area either.

Westin has been great in my European travels. The staff here was excellent at front desk, concierge, and restaurants.

Rooms are clean.

I don't have a comparison to judge against in Dublin but enjoyed the stay here.",5,2014,08,14
202,Beautiful hotel,"I travel a lot for work, and stay in many lovely hotels, but I thought the Westin in Dublin was exceptional. We stayed last weekend as a surprise for my mum, and we enjoyed excellent service during our stay. The hotel was lovely, and all the staff we encountered were friendly and helpful.

I hope to return again for a visit sometime.",5,2014,08,14
202,A Spectacular Experience,"From the very start, pulling up at the door in the rain, we were immediately surrounded by umbrellas and staff waiting to take care of our every need. That set the scene for three amazing days of over and above service - from the amazing breakfasts to the ever-so-helpful staff, to concierge knowledge, to a special 50th wedding note for my parents, to the front desk efficiency, to the spectacular rooms. My whole family came away with a resounding ""amazing"" in relation to our stay.",5,2014,08,12
202,A fantastic place in central Dublin,"You could not ask for a better hotel in central Dublin.  This place has the bed and pillows you will only find in a Westin.  Everything is high quality and really lets you relax.

The breakfast in the atrium is well worth a stop.  The staff is more than helpful.  No matter how strange the request is they will help.

If you are interested in drinking it is very near temple bar area.  I would definitely stay here again. ",5,2014,08,12
202,Cannot beat the location for walking around Dublin,"The Westin Dublin is perfectly situated in the heart of Dublin.  It is directly across the street from Trinity College (Book of Kells) and the Temple Bar area.  Also a nice stroll to St Stephen's Green and Dublin Castle.  

Beyond the great location, it is also a nice hotel.  The restaurants and bar are nice and the staff is excellent.  The concierge booked a private walking tour for us that was excellent (and less expensive than the one that we had tried to book on our own).  

The only drawback for me was the fitness facility - it's serviceable but clearly an afterthought (in a room with no windows).  

So, bottom line is that if you plan to walk around and see the sights, this hotel fits the bill.",4,2014,08,12
202,Beware Hotel is in Middle of Huge City Construction Project,"I liked this hotel overall and would return.  However, there were a few negative issues.  First, the hotel is in the middle of a huge city construction project to install rail tracks on the street facing the hotel.  In fact, there is quite a bit of construction going on in this area.  My husband communicated with two staff members before we arrived asking for two interconnecting rooms in the most quiet part of the hotel.  He received two replies confirming our request.  In fact, they did reserve interconnecting rooms in the quiet section and held them until the afternoon before we arrived and then gave them away to another family (???).  We arrived late at night completely exhausted from our flight from California to find that our rooms were gone.  The Eastern European staff member gave us interconnecting rooms facing the construction sight.  ""Sorry we have nothing else.""  No thanks.   So a Spanish staff member (majority of the staff seems to be from Spain) found a small internal room with a small queen bed on the fourth floor with two windows facing the indoor atrium.   Two of us took that.  Two of us had to wait another night to get a smaller internal room with two twin beds and one window facing the atrium also on the fourth floor.  Not interconnecting.  Less convenient for a family. 

Did we get quiet?  Not really.  While we had no street traffic or construction noise the rooms are not quiet.  The a/c unit shuts off and on frequently with clicking noises.  The walls are pretty thin so you can hear the tv from your neighbor.  The doors are heavy so you hear the slamming of them from people entering and exiting their rooms.  This proved to be problematic as we had rowdy neighbors who came back drunk very late at night and slammed their doors.  One night they had a drunken fight and I had to call security (they came in two seconds).  I slept with ear plugs.  Bad guests are not the fault of the hotel.

The rooms are simple, comfortable and fine if you just need a place to sleep in a good location in Dublin.  We had a desk, desk chair and another armchair.  The bathroom was adequate.  The first night I had to clean the toilet seat but after that I always found it clean.  We kept the curtains closed as we did not want people across the atrium to be able to look in.   They remembered not to use air freshener in our rooms.

The hotel staff are very nice and helpful and despite the room issue we felt that they were otherwise well trained.  In particular, the Irish concierge was extremely friendly and useful with advice and maps.  He took a long time giving each guest advice.  No request was too much for him.

There are two breakfast venues as the hotel.  We ate breakfast most of the week at the Atrium.  It is a lovely and relaxing room with comfortable chairs and lots of light.  I enjoyed the smoked salmon and a fruit salad most mornings and my husband liked his eggs benedict.  He likes his eggs runny and had to return one cooked too well.  The very nice chef actually came out to talk to him to make sure he was pleased with the second batch.  Our pretty, friendly and efficient waitress was Dutch and a pleasure to see first thing in the morning (and get to practice my Dutch with).   On our last morning we ate at The Exchange and did not enjoy it.  It faces the street and has large windows so we asked the hostess if we could sit in one of the two available tables by the windows.  She rudely informed us that they were ""reserved"" even though there was no reserved cards on them.  She sat us in a dark corner behind a pillar.  I got increasingly more upset as not a single person showed up for the ""reserved"" tables.  Finally, seeing that I was angry she moved us to a table by the window.  I ordered eggs on gluten free bread.  They arrived with regular bread.  My husband's order was also not done properly.  We would not return to eat at the Exchange.

I think this hotel is a good option for a visit to Dublin.  Despite the issues I would return.  The Irish are a very friendly bunch and my overall impression of my visit is a positive one.  We have happy thoughts of breakfast in the Atrium.  Those mornings will be missed.",4,2014,08,11
202,Great Stay,"I am very picky when it comes to where I stay, and more often than not I am often disappointed in the price vs. quality of most European hotels. 

I am happy to say that after a two night stay this past week, I can confirm that the Westin Dublin deserves 5 stars!

Location: Perfect. 5 minutes to Trinity College, Grafton, Temple Bar, and pretty much any other centrally located attraction one could think of.

Room: The Westin is part of Amex's Fine Hotel and Resorts program, which is often the service we use when booking our hotels. We booked a deluxe room and were upgraded to a two story suite per the FHR deal. From the winding staircase to the beautiful sitting room to the balcony, I have nothing negative to say. The room was also spotless, which is always a huge thing for me.

Service: Top notch. Everyone was super friendly and helpful, check-in and check-out was a breeze, and I loved the added note on each name tag of what the individual's ""passion"" is. Such a great conversation starter.

A few minor negatives: room service food is rather bland and (as always) overpriced. Avoid it. Also, our duvet had a blood stain on it but that problem was quickly remedied by the cleaning staff.

Overall: I highly recommend this hotel. I've had great luck with Westins around the world. Definitely my go-to hotel when traveling.",5,2014,08,10
202,Overnighter,"First we only stayed for one night and did not avail of any of the hotels Food and Beverage options, It is primarily a city centre business hotel with internal rooms facing an internal sealed court yard. Rooms are of the class you would expect with Westin group and the service we experienced was efficient.
As this is a city hotel we requested an internal court yard room to avoid the street noise, this worked well for us however I am not sure if the windows opened, this was not a big deal for us but may be for some people.
Room was quiet and air con worked, usual corridor noise but could not hear anything through the walls.
great location for city walks and seemed to have a decent foor offering.",3,2014,08,06
202,Great hotel!!,"Just had my birthday weekend in Dublin. Stayed at the Westin Dublin. Lovely stay! Check in was quick and staff very polite. We were upgraded to a city view room on the second floor. Room was very clean, spacious and cosy. When we arrived to the room a cake was sent up, which was really nice of them! We ordered room service and even though it was just after 22h30, the kind staff allowed us to order from the normal menu as the night time menu kicks in at 22h30. We had the tomato soup as a starter and created our own salads as a main. We also had a bottle of sauvignon blanc from New Zealand. The food and drinks arrived quite quickly and the presentation was lovely. Best room service I have had in a long time. Bed was very comfortable. Westin beds are the best! Staff was kind enough to give us a late check out on the Sunday at 1pm. Wifi free in the lobby but paid for in the room. Location great, right opposite Trinity College and various bus stops. Concierge very good and friendly too. Hope to return soon, thanks for a lovely stay!!",5,2014,08,06
202,Weekend Away,"The Westin on Westmoreland street could not be more convenient to Temple Bar, Trinity College and all the street vendors.  The hotel itself is beautiful and staff more than attentive when asked questions.  Would definately recommend and stay again",5,2014,08,05
202,2 days in Dublin,"My wife and I started our trip to Ireland in Dublin.  This hotel is in a great central location,near to Temple Bar, the River and Trinity College.  
The staff were quite accomadating, we got our room early, and the concierge was very helpful in his advice.  
The rooms are comfortable and well equipped.  The breakfast in the Exchange restaurant is expensive, and the charge for in room wifi seems unreasonable. 
Overall a very good choice for a Dublin stay.
",4,2014,08,04
202,"Very good location, but some stuff isn't as expected","I stayed one night here for business. As I was arriving in the morning I had planned to go to the gym until my room would be ready.

Surprise, the gym doesn't look as on the pictures... It is a room without windows and just few  exercising tools. No place where you could change... Nor shower...

I had also checked out the ""spa""... It is located in front of the elevator and is so small that everything is squeezed in... But the service there was good!

The room I got was on the 4th floor with a window but no view as there is a wall until half height...

Overall very good located, but if you travel often for business probably not the best option...

The curry in the bar lower level was great! And also a very good service there.

Average because things aren't as they look. And because this doesn't come up to the expectations you have for such a hotel.",3,2014,08,03
202,Reliably nice!,"After traveling over night it was wonderful to arrive to a clean and comfortable stay at the Westin. We were able to get into 1 of our 2 rooms early which made things easier for all of us. Location was great, we walked around easily to pubs, restaurants, trinity college and shopping. The doorman was very kind and helpful. It was a bit disappointing that of all 6 places we stayed while in Ireland (and by double the most expensive)  it was the only place to charge for WIFI. overall this was a great starting point for our Ireland vacation. ",4,2014,08,03
202,Five Star Staff,"You expect high quality service, fine features and spacious accommodation when in the Westin. We get that every time we stay. Ross the concierge is more knowledgeable about Dublin city centre than several seasoned doormen in NYC hotels where we stay. We booked several complex taxi journeys through the Westin and discovered the hotel has a business arrangement with a taxi service that feels like a luxury travel option. I appreciate the aroma of fresh cut flowers in the main lobby and believe Westin's atrium is one of the best places in Dublin to read a newspaper. Its tea service is impeccable as well. TIP: Be careful walking around Trinity (300m from the front door) after 11PM at night. You need good street sense to avoid loud and obnoxious people crawling home from the pub.",5,2014,08,02
202,be careful!,"Stayed three nights at this hotel in Dublin.  It is a fantastic location.  The staff is unbelievably accommodating and helpful.  The room was nice.  However, what was not helpful was the fact that I had booked the room before leaving the states telling them by phone that I had a 15 year old with me who is very tall and would need a bed brought into the room.  Upon arriving, I was told that we would have to pay extra for the bed of 45 euros a night.  I showed them my confirmation and they didn't honor the price I was quoted.  Then when we went back to the hotel after our travels and before leaving for home, the price included the extra bed and was cheaper.  Also on the last night they tried to charge us for WiFi.  I guess my thought is that one should be very careful upon booking to get a price quoted and have them stick with it.  Otherwise, nice hotel.",4,2014,08,01
202,Excellent Hotel,"Stayed here for 3 nights, this is a great place to stay if you want to be in the centre of Dublin, and stay in comfort.

Very central location, walking distance to most things.

Fantastic bed!!!.  Can not fault the bed in any way.  You could stay in it 24/7.",4,2014,08,01
202,"Great Location, Huge Rooms","We loved staying here, right in the centre of dublin, with very big rooms. The staff were very friendly and had rooms with very nice views. it was a charming hotel with some of the biggest hotel rooms we have ever come across. Would recommend to anyone looking to stay in the centre of dublin in a large hotel room.",5,2014,07,31
202,Great location - Average service,"Located steps from Dublin's famous Temple Bar district, River Liffey, and airport bus, the Westin's location location couldn't have been more convenient. The staff, however, seemed perpetually flustered, and couldn't answer basic questions about the city without referring to Google (e.g., bus stops, relative locations of historic landmarks, etc.) and were sometimes downright inattentive. Though I was the only person waiting, it took 5 minutes to get a receptionist to acknowledge me at check-in. Breakfast was not worth the ‚Ç¨24 fee, and compared to every other hotel in Ireland I stayed in during my trip, the ‚Ç¨15/day wifi was outrageous. Also beware of the slippery marble floors in bathrooms.",3,2014,07,30
202,A little bit if luxury in the centre if the city,Stayed here over the weekend. Like a lot of others we had booked for the Garth Brooks concert but we had decided to go on ahead and didn't consider cancelling. Peter the doorman is the most welcoming and friendliest member if staff. It was lovely to be greeted by such an affable dubliner. I really hope the management appreciate him! All the staff were efficient and welcoming; smiles and greetings were turned on everytime you walked through the lobby; it was nice but a bit over the top at times. We had a room over looking Westmoorland street and the view was fabulous. Noise was not an issue even though we were steps away from templebar. The cleanliness and comfort was second to none. The beds were unbelievably comfortable and the bathroom was just lovely. I liked the little touches such as lights inside the wardrobe and the iHome docking station and alarm clock. Any requests we made were met imediately and the staff could not have done enough for us. It was a very relaxing stay and definitely a cut above the surrounding 4 star hotels but if I had any niggles to complain about it is the lack of free wifi. Practically everywhere in the city centre provide free wifi. Other hotels do and I don't see why the Westin can't. There is wifi in public areas but it is slow. once you get to your room you have to pay! The staff are extremely professional but a little too professional at times. There was very little conversation or banter entered into. I would like to see the staff be a little more human and less robotic but I Couldn't fault their level if service. We will most certainly be back at the Westin as the location is just perfect!,4,2014,07,28
202,Had to come or loose our money!!,"We too had suffered at the hands of the Garth Brooks concert and booked here for the 27th of July, I rang reservations as soon as the concerts were officially canceled and I was told I would not receive a refund! So I drove 4 hrs to go up and stay in the hotel because I did not want to see my money go to waste! Now the hotel is nice and in a good location, but I can't but help feel a little cheated since iv read a previous review and the manager said that other customers got a refund and I was never offered one! I had no reason to visit Dublin since the concert was cancelled! I arrived at this 5 star hotel where you have to pay ‚Ç¨25 per night to park your car, pay for wifi etc, iv stayed in quiet a few 5 star hotels and all of this is normally complimentary. Overall I should not have had to come here when the concert was cancelled, I had no reason to come here but I didn't want to see my hard earned money go to waste!",1,2014,07,27
202,Great service,"The folks in the hotel were very attentive. Sometimes chain hotels in big cities can lack charm and service, but not here. The staff was friendly and helpful. The rooms were comfortable. The gym was simple and small, but functional to get a workout. The location was excellent ending right across from the Temple Bar area and close to many major attractions. Even so, it was not overly noisy or crowded. I recommend this hotel.",5,2014,07,27
202,Excellent Location,We stayed here on our first two nights in Ireland.  Couldn't have been nicer.  The location is right in the middle of most of the things we wanted to do.  Walked everywhere we went.  Within a block of Trinity College.,5,2014,07,24
202,Disgusting Customer Service,I have always wanted to stay in the Westin so I booked it for my visit to the Capital to see Garth Brooks. Unfortunately as this isn't going ahead I contacted the hotel to see what they could do. They informed me that they couldn't do anything to help. They wouldn't consider to reschedule my booking or provide a gift voucher. It's shocking that they have such a ridiculous level of understanding. Their sheer greed has now completely put me off this hotel. I Won't be considering or recommending them for any events that take place in the city in future.,1,2014,07,23
202,Prime location,"The hotel has a stately exterior; inside, the lobby is a bit bland, and the hotel rooms a little small, a little stuffy, and the walls a little thin (at certain places, you can hear your neighbours watching the TV). The TV is difficult to operate, with a spotty remote, and there's no dazzling scenic views from the windows, or really any views outside at all (our room had a window, unlike many others, but it faced inside the building to the inner courtyard). The service is pleasant, and accommodating. While the room itself is not a great place to lounge, the atrium on the mezzanine floor, just a red-carpeted staircase away from the lobby, is very relaxing, with a sprawl of broad, velvety armchairs and loveseats surrounding ornate coffee tables. Early in the morning and late at night, before large amounts of people descend, is the best time to go, and grab a snack or a cup of coffee. The space is pleasant and roomy, with a high glass ceiling. The friendliest members of the Westin's staff work here. 
The best feature of the Westin Dublin is its location. An urban, artsy Starbucks is located just down the street if you're feeling homesick, and a tourist center is just across. The hotel is also right smack dab in the center of the city, and it's a walking distance away from almost anything in this very pedestrian city, including the most popular spot, Trinity College.",4,2014,07,23
202,Little gem in heart of Dublin,"Loved this hotel!  I am loyal to the Starwood brand, but sometimes Westins can be hit or miss.  This was definitely a hit!  This is a cozy building tucked into the heart of Dublin, right in the middle of everything.  You can walk out the door and see all of the tourist attractions on foot. Right across from temple bar, but not loud at all - my room was facing Trinity. So nice to come back to at the end of a long day.  I especially loved the breakfast, it was really outstanding.  If I go back to Dublin, I would happily reserve here again.",5,2014,07,22
202,Excellence!,"As per all my (many!) Westin hotel visits across the world - before becoming a Trip Advisor member - service, friendliness, cleanliness, hospitality and knowledge of the staff here was excellent. As a result, I ONLY choose to stay in Westin hotels where they are available as their standards are excellent.  Nothing was too much trouble, questions (even the ridiculous!) were answered helpfully and courteously, with a smile and the rooms were spotless! Also possibly one of the best European breakfasts my family have ever experienced with everything 'expected' available .....and more! Central .location was a huge plus, with Temple Bar literally seconds away and all main attractions I wanted my family to see within very easy access. A truly highly recommended hotel which I will definitely visit again if I am passing through or visiting Dublin.",5,2014,07,22
202,"Great hotel, best location","Not you typical Westin.  Very nice hotel, super clean rooms, great staff and probable the best cup of coffee from room service I ever had.  This property is located right in the middle of the city and is close to most of the action in Dublin.  

Room ( no suite UPG for SPG Plat ) was very nice & super clean.  Absolutely great room service and best cup of coffee I've ever had.  Great staff at both bars, front desk & bellman.",5,2014,07,22
202,Terrible customer service and poor functioning rooms,I was really surprised to find my experience at this very nice property so terrible.  The hotel is in a great location with a beautiful lobby but the customer service fell completely apart thereafter.   The toilet did not work and had to call the front desk three times in order to inform them.  It is embarrassing to call the front desk because you can not flush everything down the toilet.  The service just made the toilet flush but nothing else worked nor was the problem resolved or a proper follow-up.   The bed was the smallest bed I have seen for such a hotel.  When my partner checked out they claimed it was 180cm by 200 which is completely false as we own such a bed and know the bed was no larger than 160cm.  When challenged to go measure the bed the front desk swallowed their words and were quite (honesty is the best policy at the end of the day!) The bed was of poor quality and we kept sinking into the middle each and every night.   I believe since I used points and paid for only one night with cash they did not care about our experience and gave us one of the smallest rooms with only one chair.   I travel frequently for work and for leisure and have not had such an experience at such a hotel in a very long time which was magnified by how they handled the situation.  Do not ask how our experience was if you do not care really at the end of the day....,1,2014,07,22
202,Nice hotel....but poor customer experience,"I have stayed in the Westin Dublin in Feb 2014, hotel is well presented & great location for bars, however I won't be staying here ever again as their handling of the Garth Brooks saga has left a bad taste in my mouth. I will never be recommending the hotel to anyone else.

 The other major hotels in Dublin are giving refunds to customer impacted by Dublin city councils decision to block concerts...I think I'll be staying with them in future. 

The Westin would not even consider moving the reservation to a different date. Was booked as a Mother's Day present and between them Dublin city council & The Westin Dublin have ruined her trip away.",1,2014,07,17
202,Home away from home,"I travel for business and stay at a Westin whenever possible because they appreciate my business, which is demostrated by their staff at check in and I know what to expect, regardless of the country I'm in. North American versus European hotels are very different. European hotels have much smaller rooms, beds, bathrooms and rarely have air conditioning. I'm from North America and accustomed to larger rooms with AC. The Dublin Westin is perfectly located in Dublin and you can walk to anything. When you get back to your hotel, it's like coming home. I highly recommend the Westin chain, but if you're in Dublin, you won't be disappointed with this hotel",5,2014,07,14
202,Doesn't get any better...,"My first trip abroad, arriving by myself, for the first day of my vacation.  The Westin in Dublin was a very welcoming experience.  The location was amazing.  The room couldn't have been more comfortable.  The beds really are ""heavenly"".  I felt comfortable walking to Grafton Street, and other areas by myself.  I met cousins at the Westin, and enjoyed tea.  This wonderful destination set the tone for the rest of the trip.  I can't recommend it enough!  After a 10 hour flight, this beautiful hotel fit the bill perfectly.  No jet lag because of my stay here!",5,2014,07,12
202,Great Hotel in Ideal Location,"his is a great hotel in an ideal location. It is walking distance to nearly everything, but in a quiet spot.  Check in was quick and informative.  Baggage assistance was excellent both upon arrival and departure.  Our room was very large with an oversized bathroom.  The beds, as expected, were ""heavenly.""  Of course, The Westin wasn't the cheapest choice, but you get what you pay for.  I would return without hesitation. The only bummer was no free in-room wi-fi.  You had to head down to the lobby for the free service.",5,2014,07,11
202,Ideal location,"We wanted to be near the action of downtown Dublin such as Temple Bar, Grafton St., O'Connell Street and Trinity College, but not listen to all the accompanying noise at night. The Westin's accommodations met all of our expectations, was supremely quiet and more. Their concierge service was excellent, recommending to us to The Pig's Ear, the best meal we had during our week in Ireland, and to a tasty bakery for Sunday brunch. Driving to the hotel was also a breeze, a nice surprise considering all the travel guides who told us not to drive in Dublin.",5,2014,07,09
202,Wonderful,"We had a terrible experience at another hotel and the Westin was one of the few in the city that had rooms available. They were so helpful. They found a lovely room and even upgraded us to compensate for our troubles at a completely different hotel. The breakfast was perfect, location is in the middle of everything, and the spa services were on point and reasonable. Definitely recommend staying here.",5,2014,07,08
202,Consistently good service & room selection tips,"Westin is my preferred hotel in Dublin. It has reliably consistent service, great location and reasonable price for what it offers. I used this hotel more than 10 times since 2003, and this particular review relate to my 3 past stays throughout May-June.

Please read my prior review if you are interested in more details. This one will reflect on changes made in the hotel and it's surroundings since last stay and general observations on room selection.

Westin Dublin finished renovating 5th floor so there is no more construction noise. They also installed card readers in the elevators which improved security. It is, however, in the middle of large construction project around the hotel and at the college green - installation of rail tracks for city's new tram line. Driving around is difficult and when tram will be operational I believe rooms that face tracks (to be laid along College street) will be even noisier than currently. Their main restaurant was only open for breakfasts due to construction outside (I was told till November).

Hotel itself spans several old buildings in approximately triangular shape defined by Westmorland street (where the entrance is), Fleet Street and College street. It therefore have 2 broad room categories - these facing one of the streets,these facing the atrium and these facing internal courtyard. Rooms at the floor 5 will have reduced ceiling height (that can be touched by hand), therefore are quite claustrophobic and not really recommended.

Outside facing rooms: the biggest enemy of these rooms is street/traffic noise. Rooms facing Westmoreland street are noisiest (due to bigger street with more traffic and because of temple bar entrance). Ones facing Fleet Street are somewhat less noisy with rooms facing College Street are somewhere in the middle (but probably be noisiest when tram will be operational). 

Rooms facing atrium: less noisy due to them facing enclosed area, can be however considerably noisier when there is a function at Atrium lounge (but these always end before 11pm). Have generally less light and are smaller than these facing outside (I don't think there are any deluxe rooms that face the atrium). Another issue with these is privacy as one either need to have blinds clods at all times or face the fact that whatever you do is clearly visible to rooms across the atrium.

Rooms facing internal courtyard are least noisy, but there are not too many of them. 

From category point of view, there are standard rooms (atrium facing), deluxe rooms and suites (writer rooms can be considered as jr suite or suite based on your tastes). Majority of rooms seem to be deluxe rooms. Due to hotel spanning several old buildings, majority of suites and some of the rooms will have different configuration, so if you stayed in one before, or viewed one at the hotel web site, don't expect that yours will be the same. Therefore, if you don't like your room layout, don't assume that all other rooms are the same - ask management to show another room (if rooms are available they usually accommodate requests to move).

Upgrades: most often, they will upgrade from standard to deluxe room. If you booked deluxe room already, don't expect to be upgraded into suite (regardless if you are gold or platinum SPG guest - in past 10 years I had either status and was upgraded into suite only once). If noise is something you don't tolerate we'll, you may consider declining the upgrade into deluxe room as most of these will be external-facing.

The best way to proceed if you are interested in particular room is to email the hotel.  They always reply and most often accommodate reasonable requests. Another request you may consider making in advance is to decide whether you want a fridge in your room - if you do, they can free the minibar for you to use as a fridge.

I cannot possibly describe every feature of this hotel - if you have ay questions please let me know.",4,2014,07,08
202,Great Property!,We really enjoyed the convenient location of The Westin.  Easy access to the DART and steps away from Temple Bar and Grafton Street.  Excellent furnishings in room and nice linens.  The bath was over the top nice!  Staff was always eager to address any needs and always pleasant.  Late check in time of 4:00 which seems to be the norm in Dublin.  We had to wait on our room on a previous trip at another property.  Really inconvenient to wait six hours for a check in after traveling all night and you really can't explore while waiting without a shower.  I would advise anyone to plan your flight around these late check ins.  Other than that it was perfect!,5,2014,07,06
202,outstanding choice,"Very friendly and helpful staff. Food recommendations were right on. Conceirge and doormen were super. room was lovely, spacious, very comfortable. Wonderfful location. Near Trinity College, Book of Kells, Temple and wide choice of restaurants.  Sunday breakfast terrific
, lots of smoked salmon, decent coffee.",5,2014,07,06
202,"Iontach stay at the Westin, Dublin","This was my first visit to Ireland. I was going through the possible hotels to stay at for my first visit and came across the Westin. Knowing the Westin brand, I knew there wasn't a possibility of being disappointed but my stay exceeded all expectations. The location of the hotel, near Trinity College was the perfect view to start my day. The large windows in the rooms act as the perfect binoculars for a view of lovely Dublin. When you enter the hotel the smell of eucalyptus accentuates throughout making the welcome even better. The Westin sticks to the very high standards it has set across the world. First time in Dublin. You have to stay at the Westin.",5,2014,07,03
202,Amazing afternoon tea,"Brought my mother here for afternoon tea for her birthday and I really can't speak highly enough of the staff. We had the 'peculiar' afternoon tea which was absolutely delicious, particularly the top tier. The staff were welcoming and so helpful and really went the extra mile to make her feel special.",5,2014,07,02
202,Just superb!,"I hosted a group of 9 rooms here this past weekend and the hotel was brilliant. Easy check in, great service, perfect location. Really really great stay. Concierge set us up a private tour to malahide castle billed right to my room and great dinner reservations around town.",5,2014,06,30
202,Woderful,"Perfect in every way.  Beautiful hotel right beside Trinity College and steps to the Temple 
Bar area.  Super nice soft beds and with great pillows and plenty of extra pillows.  Beautiful bathrooms with gorgeous marble floors and french doors.  Big windows giving us views to the college and and city around us.  There was a wonderful aroma of eucalyptus when you entered the lobby and elevators, and the toiletries in your bath had the same aroma... nice touch.  
We were also able to buy our hop on hop off bus passes from the concierge in the lobby which was handy.  ( but they did not offer the discounted tickets for seniors, student or children)  
Beautiful orchids in the lobby.
Great pick for seeing Dublin, we had rental cars while seeing the rest of the country, but upon arrival to Dublin, left our cars in Westin's hands and they called our rental company (Dooley's) and they came and picked them up without us having to pay for parking in town or having to wait until they arrived to pick them up.  Westin was wonderful!  
You do not need a car for Dublin, walking is easy distant for most things, and the hop on hop off bus also is great way to go.",5,2014,06,27
202,Location and comfort,"I give 10 out of 10 to both location and comfort .
Location is central . Night life , shopping , attractions , buses , restaurants and everything else is a 2 min walk , if not less .
The hotel is quite and the bed is marvelous . Excellent sleeping is guaranteed . The hotel itself is well maintained and luxurious .
It has an attractive bar ( The mint bar) and an excellent fitness centre.
Now comes the negatives , the breakfast is OK but not to a standard as expected , limited selections and little amount . There is no free wifi . This is ridiculous as all other hotels with less price have free wifi in rooms , all the caf√©s and even all the buses. Also there is no pool . Despite all these , still you will be satisfied and happy during your stay especially if it is the first time you come to Dublin . I do recommend it .",4,2014,06,27
202,Great location,"Stayed 3 nights.superb location in city center. Good room with view of Fleet Street .very comfortable bed.
Staff very attentive and courteous.reasonable prices in bar and restaurant with good service and food quality.day concierge staff very helpful with advice and directions.",5,2014,06,23
202,The Best of the Best in Dublin,"The Westin is conveniently located in the heart of Dublin, across the street from Trinity College and within walking distance to all the major landmarks and ‚Äúmust-sees‚Äù of the city.

We were too early to check in when we arrived at 10AM but Yellena, at the front desk, collected our suitcases and had the bellhop store them. Within a couple of hours, we received a phone call from her letting us know our room was ready. When we returned to the hotel, Yellena was so excited to let us know she upgraded us to a superior king size room and wished us well on our 26th wedding anniversary. She checked us in quickly and informed us all our suitcases were already brought to our room. 

The room was very spacious with a touch of modern luxury. The bathroom was immense, as well. After walking all day, it was a treat to just soak and relax in the tub. My husband and I had a restful sleep on the heavenly bed and pillows. 

Everything at the hotel was above par from the location, the lobby, the restaurant, the amenities and the room but what makes the Westin the best in Dublin is the outstanding staff who makes you feel welcome as soon as you set your foot in the door.",5,2014,06,23
202,Great one night stay in Dublin,"A great hotel in the center of Dublin.    The staff was extremely helpful and welcomed us the minute we approached the hotel.   The hotel's central location made it possible to walk to all attractions, great restaurants and shopping. The rooms were well equipped with coffee/tea and the beds were extremely comfortable.
My only complaint was the charge for internet.   I had just finished a coach tour of Ireland and every hotel we stayed in had free wifi.  I was a bit surprised to find the Westin had a fee to use their internet.   
The front desk was very accommodating and I would definitely stay at the Westin again.",5,2014,06,23
202,Amazing!,"The Westin is steps away from Trinity college and a short walk to temple bar and the river. Easily accessible to all types of public transport it's the perfect location. Staff went out of their way to be accommodating and friendly. I asked to switch rooms and they did it immediately. Loves this hotel. Would go back in a minute!

",5,2014,06,21
202,A real treat.... Very central too.,"A genuine 5 star. If our American friends like it I'm sure I will. I was right. It was exactly the treat I wanted for our anniversary. I love the Trinity area of Dublin anyway and you're between the best shops and visitor sites in Dublin. Grafton St and O'Connell St are a 5 min walk away. Taxi's always at the Westin's door. The Westin Hotel is an amazing building to start. A very friendly bunch of well groomed staff meet you and will bend over backwards to make your time enjoyable. We had a hiccup with the room booking purely because of the third party company I booked with via Trip Advisor. Be careful with ""Amoma.com"" as what I booked didn't mean the same with the Westin. Book with the Westin's website to be sure. Still, The Westin did their utmost to give us their best with what they had. Rooms are spotless and bathroom massive too. Our queen sized bed was soooo comfy. The Mint Bar had a menu that suited us before our nite out. Delicious food. Staff again were very pleasant. Breakfast was 5* too. Staff again were happy to help. Great service and very quick. We were given a 3pm complimentary checkout which was perfect as our train home was at 4pm. I liked the fact that the staff were smiling. That's important. Good staff make a good Hotel 'great'. Worth the extra for a perfect treat. Thanks Westin.",5,2014,06,19
202,"Kind and helpful, excellent location","The Westin Dublin is quite unique. With the Westin brand, you usually get the same, anywhere you are. I love the Westin Dublin because the staff is fantastic, always reaching out to help you and offer tips for your time in the city. You will be step out of the hotel and be within reach to great pubs, shopping, site seeing and more. Take a look online to see the great decor of this hotel and get planning! I booked this hotel the day before I left the U.S. and got a good rate. My only word of caution is that the Atrium Lounge staff needs additional training. The server was unable to make an amaretto and o.j. and then later a courvoisier on ice. Stick to using brand names (Disaronno, etc.) and you shouldn't have any trouble. You will love this hotel.",5,2014,06,18
202,"Some ups and some downs, but it's Dublin and you're only sleeping here!","Overall a positive experience.  Loved the old building and accommodations.  The location is perfect and close to everything.  The rooms are well appointed.  We arrived on a red-eye from the States and they actually let us get into our room at 8AM, hours before actual check in time, to nap.

No free continental breakfast, like at the Hilton down the block (which was the most amazing continental breakfast I've ever seen!) and the internet was down more than a few times.  many of us were standing around while they tried to get it online.  This was four of the five days we were there.  Also, there was a misunderstanding with the rooms.  We were a party of five and they did not have the correct accommodations reserved so there was a bit of room swapping and juggling but they ultimately made things right and credited my account for our trouble, which was nice.  I would stay here again as I sought out the Westin specifically for its higher end experience.  This location delivered.",4,2014,06,17
202,Wonderful Hotel,Great Hotel with perfect city centre location within walking distance of all sights.  Wonderful rooms and very attentive staff.   Westin at its best - great food adn service but also close to other less expensive restaurants if needed.  Would definitely come back when next in Dublin.,5,2014,06,16
202,Great Location,The Westin is in the perfect location for visiting Dublin. It's right across the street from Trinity College and so very close to all the great restaurants/pubs/shopping/museums....the list is endless. The accomodations are 1st class along with the service. Great place to stay and I encourage everyone to take advantage of location.,5,2014,06,15
202,"Elegant, traditional for best city center location","Very pleased w/ the Westin Dublin hotel for it's location, room details (wonderful mattress & shower), pleasant city view, and traditional decor.  My only concern was that the hotel was overbooked by ""Adventure Disney Tours"" so for example, when I dialed the front desk -  the phone would just ring & ring w/out being answered or when I went to the bell desk for map directions - nobody was staffing it because they were assisting the large group.  A couple of times, I entered the lobby and it was challenging to walk through to the elevator due to all the tour people and their bags.  I also received several mis-directed phone calls asking if I was with the ""tour"".  Otherwise, I enjoyed the glass ceiling Mint Bar for tea and a snack and the assistance of the staff on where to eat locally (I loved the suggested nearby ""Winding Stair"" & ""The Pig's Ear"" restaurants).  Yes, I would elect to stay here again.... hoping that it would be unlikely that the number of guests would overwhelm the hotel's availability a second time.",4,2014,06,14
202,Super location; Friendly Staff,"Having never been to Dublin, I felt some of my normal standards regarding hospitality may be different than in the US.  I'm in a foreign country which means there will be some kind of surprise-- good or not.  The Westin Dublin is in a great location for tourists and business travelers being yards from the Temple Bar --bar-restaurant scene, Trinity University and the main shopping area of central Dublin.

The building is old but has been modernized.  The lobby is nice but nothing notable comes to mind.   We are a family of three so had an upgraded standard which had a king and a nice twin.  We had our stuff in every available spot but didn't find it objectionable. Our room faced the street and had a window that opened partially-- this is a very important feature for us because we like fresh air for sleeping. The bathroom was nice-- another important factor in judging a hotel for me.  

The bathroom had a floor that I covet-- 10x10 pillow cut in Carrera marble which feels good under your feet-- not shiny or slippery but stylish rustic.  A lovely bathtub, decent shower ( not great if you are really tall) with the best hot water and pressure ever, good size sink and best was the lighting and storage capacity. There wasn't a cabinet but there were ledges here and there for all toiletries we had. This is key because my 14 year old has lots of hair products. I love that I could see my pores because the lighting was bright.  Greta bath products that smell wonderful.  THEY HAVE WASHCLOTHS!!!  Yeah.  So thrilled about this one little thing.

Dings go to the fitness center for size which was WAY too small and WAY TOO hot. No ventilation!  

Staff were all exemplary.  Shout out to Sam Heath for helping us before we arrived and upon arrival.  Pretty front desk blonde- redhead was genuinely sweet and pleasant!  She nailed all the main ""arrival details"" smoothly and with confidence.

Westin was a highlight of our stay in Ireland.",5,2014,06,13
202,Excellent all around!,"I stayed at this property for 3 days this month.  Being a SPG platinum member I get a wide spectrum of treatment by hotel staff.  Some barely acknowledge it and some go above and beyond.  This was definitely in my top five of all time.  From the front desk, to the bellmen, to the restaurant, everyone was amazing.  The hotel is in excellent shape.  Really top notch all around.",5,2014,06,13
202,All perfect except for a fail on wifi,"The location of this hotel is just great.  Across the street from Triinity campus, and a quick walk to Grafton street and the Temple Bar area.  The staff was great, it was our anniversary and when we went to our room there was a slice of cheesecake waiting for us with a card.  We paid extra to upgrade our room, it was a Very Nice room with a view of Trinity campus with a long walk from the elevator with some steps so not too accessible.  The only irritation at this hotel is that they charge you for wifi.  I was not aware that the lobby had free wifi because no one told me that, even though I called the front desk asking for the password to my rooms wifi.  Come on. Even our aircoach bus from the airport had free wifi!  The starbucks near this hotel had free wifi. But not our room. It would have been nice to have been told there was free wifi in the lobby, but I was never told that so that does not count.",5,2014,06,11
202,Top notch staff,"My family (husband, 4 year old son, and I) recently stayed the Westin Dublin for a few nights in early May.  I had stayed once before years ago on a business trip and liked the convenient location near Temple Bar, so we decided to splurge on a Deluxe Room. The room was surprisingly spacious for an Irish hotel, and of course the Heavenly bed was very comfortable. But what really impressed us this time was the amazing staff. My husband had a medical emergency on our first morning. I called the front desk for help and they sent a manager, Luwen Zhou, who was first aid certified. Once she determined my husband would need to see a doctor, she called the front desk to arrange for an ambulance. She stayed with us until the EMTs arrived. After my husband was taken to the emergency room, I soon followed with our young son in tow, and Luwen kindly guided us to our taxi, holding an umbrella to block the heavy rain (of course, it's Dublin), writing down the hotel phone number just in case, and getting completely soaked herself.

Later in the day after everything was taken care of and we were resting back in our room, she called to check in on us. We had to delay our travel plans out of Dublin, so she helped me extend our stay and gave us the best possible rate to stay in our room. We were very touched and grateful for the attention and kindness.

Because we couldn't venture out on the town, we visited the lounge a few times for light meals and evening drinks. There we met Santhosh, the bartender, and again experienced extra kindness and generosity, above and beyond what is expected. We were a little self conscious about bringing our young son with us but Sathosh and the others were welcoming and even gave him special treats.

Pros:
* stellar staff
* clean, spacious, and comfortable rooms
* convenient location
* luxurious and intimate

Cons: 
* no early check-in (to be fair, I forgot to request it)
* in-room wifi not included",5,2014,06,10
202,Beautiful Location - Excellent Property,"I somehow missed reviewing this property. Westin, Dublin is a great great SPG property. I stayed in the Suite overlooking the Trinity College and the views were spectacular. 

The team was very supportive of the kids and ensured they loved the stay; got them a westin kids club goodie bag.

SPG Plats would love the cocktail hours and room upgrades. Close to many places, this property is a definite yes to stay at!!",5,2014,06,10
202,Oh my god! How fabulous.,"I traveled solo to DUBLIN, IRELAND  solo. I had NO idea what to expect. Well, it was FABULOUS. 
I took a cab to THE WESTIN, DUBLIN early morning. It was a long flight and I knew that at 8:00am a room might not be ready, but to my surprise the people were sooooooooo nice they said have breakfast and we will try to hurry and get you a room. 
What wonderful lovely people. I didn't realize such nice people still existed. The room was perfect for me. It was like a penthouse apartment. The hotel was so centrally located that I was able to walk everywhere since I didn't have a car. 
But the best thing that happened was unbelievable. Being my flight was very early I packed very fast  and when I arrived home I realized I left my favorite sweater.  I called the WESTIN and they said they will give that information to the WESTIN, DUBLIN WELL, Well today I received not only my favorite sweater but oh my god! Some of my personal items. Items I had no idea I left. I was soooooooo happy. I hope Tripadvisor can tell them just how wonderful they are. 
Thank you again

202,Charging for Wifi not on,"Stayed in this lovely hotel and everything was good except on a 5 star hotel I expect free Wifi.

Staff good, room lovely, very clean, and breakfast was very good .

So sort out Wifi and I will stay again .

202,Wonderful stay in Dublin!,"The Westin is a great hotel, right in the heart of Dublin!  My boyfriend and I spent one night here and the staff were so friendly and helpful.  The hotel is beautiful and very well maintained.  Our room was decorated nicely with modern amenities.  Everything you would expect from a Westin, including the bed and available work out clothes from New Balance!  There is also an atrium restaurant and bar that had delicious food for lunch and great tea service as well.  The bar downstairs was quite lovely as well.  The location is wonderful and easy to walk to many of the sights of Dublin, especially the more crowded shopping/restaurant areas.  Definitely a great place to stay when visiting Dublin!",5,2014,06,07
202,Disappointed,We stayed there for the last two nights as it was our anniversary. We payed 240 each night and couldn't believe we had to pay for breakfast. Our Room was quiet small. Definitely  not value for money only paying for location. ,3,2014,06,02
202,Great location for 1st time visit,Westin was centrally located for all the main attractions.  Check in was a breeze and we were given recommendations for dinner. We were extremely disappointed that WiFi was not free - really even the buses had free WiFi.  Clean room and good shower!,4,2014,06,01
202,"5 star?, No","Why would the hotel claim to be a 5 star but charge you 15 euros (approximately $21 US) a night for in room wi-fi .Come on, this is no longer the 1990's when you can get away with that.  Even
Motel 6 give you free wi-fi at many of their locations and $2.99 for in room at the others.  Shame 
on them.  Yes, you can tromp down to the lobby for free.  Do you want to when it is your last night in Dublin and you want to check airplane info, email, etc.?",3,2014,05,31
202,Great hotel in the center of everything,"On our trip to Ireland, we stayed at the Westin in Dublin.  It's central to many of the main attractions of the city and is walking distance from the Hop on, hop off bus tours.  We arrived very early in the morning, and the staff did everything they could to accommodate us while we waited for our room to be ready.  The rooms themselves are spacious and clean.  The staff is highly attentive.  I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone staying in Dublin.",5,2014,05,30
202,Wonderful Hotel,"Close to everything, very convenient - staff very friendly, attentive. Room was on the smaller side, but it's in the city, which is average for a major city hotel.  Concierge was awesome. Loved that we could walk everywhere.",5,2014,05,29
202,Ideal location in the heart of Dublin,"This Westin is a 5-story hotel located in a former bank. The beds are outstanding, and the rooms are very quiet. Excellent sleep quality! The staff were friendly and helpful.

The hotel is across the street from Trinity College, and an easy stroll to Grafton Street, Temple Bar, Ha'penny Bridge, and other attractions. Dublin Castle, the Jameson Distillery, and the Guinness Storehouse are also walking distance. You couldn't ask for a better location. Compared to other hotels in the area the Westin is also a good value. 

I had two minor complaints:

1. The bathroom needed to be re-grouted, as there was some mildew in several spots. Otherwise, the bathroom was clean and the rest of the room immaculate. 

2. Where's the free in-room Wifi? You can get complimentary wifi in the atrium lounge, but there really should be free, high-speed wifi everywhere. Small B&Bs in rural areas offered it, so the Westin needs to up their game.

That said, I wouldn't hesitate to stay at this hotel again on my next trip to Dublin. I was happy with my experience. Try the Mint Bar in the former vault for excellent cocktails in an otherwise beer-driven city.",4,2014,05,29
202,Premier location and first rate luxury!,"This spring was our second stay at The Westin Dublin.  We were again delighted. The property was formerly a grand bank, and the architecture is superb.  The staff is highly professional and courteous.  So your first moments walking in the door after a long flight will be positive. Each room is unique.  This stay we were fortunate to stay on the George Bernard Shaw Suite, which is a two story suite joined by a beautiful spiral staircase!  The bathrooms are traditional European excellence, with marble floors and walls and all the luxury appointments.. What makes my stay is the Westin Heavenly bed.  My husband and I are in business together and our schedules are packed.  We get very little sleep.  So on a vacation, the bedding is very important.  It is rare that I don't have to travel with my own pillow....the Westin Dublin has an array of luxurious pillows and a lofty comforter.  The fine luxury sheets complete the picture. Clean, clean clean!!! The first day we slept until 2pm...a miracle, but the bed was so comfortable!!  But once you venture outside, everything is within steps away!  The main shopping district...Grafton Street ....is a 5 minute short walk.  So are some of the best pubs and restaurants in the city.  One of our favorite spots is in the Westin itself.  It is in the Mint Bar, located in the lower level.  Each Friday and Saturday night there is a dancing five piece band.  The drinks are fabulous!  Best Mojitos I have ever had!  The bartender even gave us a masterclass in making those Mojitos!  So when you go to Dublin, stay at this charming first rate hotel.  You won't be disappointed.",5,2014,05,29
202,Outstanding!!,We spent our first two nights of our honeymoon in Ireland at the Westin. They were so very kind and sweet AND the location was premier for our time in Dublin! Easy walk to Temple Bar District with its excellent food and music. And the bed was incredibly comfortable!,5,2014,05,28
202,Great hotel in a great location,"My wife and I went to Ireland for the first time this past month and stayed at the Westin.  The hotel is a tremendous property with great rooms and a good central location within Dublin.  You are near numerous restaurants and less than 5 blocks away from a central train station.  The staff is very professional and accommodating.  While it is a little on the pricey side, I would recommend this hotel to anyone who is looking for an upscale hotel for business or leisure.",5,2014,05,28
202,Fabulous Hotel,"Beautiful building, in the heart of Dublin. The hotel, in our opinion, was excellent in all areas. The junior suite very luxurious, the hotel staff friendly and very warm & the food delicious. The only downside, which is temporary, is that there is currently building of the new tram line, right outside the hotel doors. The noise isn't disruptive when inside the hotel, but parking is difficult, although the concierge makes all effort to ease the situation.",5,2014,05,28
202,Highs and Lows,"I just returned from a May 18 - May 24th stay at the Westin Dublin.  This was our second time staying at this hotel, the first time being back in 2011. 

Many of the reasons we came back were the same.  Very nice hotel.  Great location.  Friendly staff.  To their credit, this trip was for a special occasion (birthdays for two members of my family) and they provided a dessert tray in the room and an invite for a goodbye cocktail on our final night.  Unfortunately, we had a negative experience that prohibits me from giving them more stars.  While packing to head home I realized my Garmin 910xt sport watch had gone missing from my room.  I of course have no choice but to assume ultimate responsibility for this incident, as I did not have it locked in the safe, but rather left it lying on the table.  I knew better and have learned an important (albeit expensive) lesson.  You would hope that something like that would not happen regardless of something being locked up or not, so it was still a frustrating and disappointing experience.  They said they would look into it, but at this point, I think it is safe to say it will not be recovered. 

I am sad to say that we will not be back to this property during our next trip.  There are plenty of other very nice hotels with great locations and comparable prices that this unfortunate incident has steered me towards trying.",3,2014,05,26
202,Modern updated great hotel in the heart of Dublin !,"Decided to stay at the Westin as a loyal Spg platinum member.  The hotel is across from trinity college and a short walk from everything - the Guinness storehouse, river, cathedrals, st Stephens green, grafton street shops, temple bar, many restaurants (and two starbucks on the same block even though I refuse to go to Starbucks while in Europe...). This place is charming as soon as you walk in the front door. Doorman was knowledgable and friendly, decor was really modern and well appointed in the rooms, there's USB charging plugs, carpets are brand new - you feel like you can walk barefoot on them and be ok. Has your standard Westin amenities  - heavenly everything and white tea smell. Continental breakfast is huge - lots of fresh fruit and traditional Irish breakfast foods. The gym, although a bit small, has brand new equipment - biggest LCD screens I've seen on a treadmill. Hotel concierge provides running maps and great recommendations of places to go - super friendly staff. Would definitely stay here again. ",5,2014,05,26
202,"Pricey, but otherwise fantastic","It's only the costs that kept this hotel from getting a 5. The rooms are pricey to me and don't include breakfast or WiFi. 

The location is great, the service was excellent and I slept so well. 

I was impressed that they called a cab for us and he arrived just moments later.",4,2014,05,25
202,Perfect After a Long Flight,"My husband and I planned a trip to Ireland that included multiple destinations, and Dublin was our first stop. We stayed here for three nights, and it was a fantastic place to stay after a long flight from Boston. Our room was available upon check-in. The room was clean and the bed was very comfortable. We were on the top floor (5th floor) and it was very quiet. Convenient location for walking around the city, relaxing atrium lounge with free wi-fi, friendly staff. We'd book here again.",4,2014,05,24
202,Classical experience,"This hotel was just beautiful. Staff warm and a beautiful atmosphere. Bedding was lush. 
Beautiful rooms with a view in to the busy dublin streets. But no city noise once the curtains where pulled.
The bathroom was all marble and very spacious. Then there was a large sitting room up the top to quietly read or just rest  just lovely.",5,2014,05,21
202,Weekend break,"Lovely sunny weekend break in Dublin.  We upgraded to a suite and it didn't disappoint!  Large room, comfy bed & huge bathroom with fantastic views over Trinity College.  The Mint bar did fantastic cocktails of an evening & the full Irish breakfast the following morning was amazing.",5,2014,05,21
202,Good location,"Rooms are too small or is it just that they put us in a room intended for one person. At check-in advised we could upgrade to king bed. I made my reservations requesting a king bed per the package I had purchased through Costco. Also, they charge a fee for WiFi. 
Apart from sales pitches - not enjoyable while on vacation, the hotel was in a great location, the staff were most helpful, they deserve a five star rating, just not the practices of the hotel.",3,2014,05,20
202,Great hotel!,"My family and I just returned from a week long trip, ending our last few days in Dublin at the Westin.  Overall, we thought the rooms were lovely, clean and spacious.  The location is great- 2 min. to Trinity, Grafton, with easy access to airport transportation (see my tip below).  The staff was very friendly and always willing to help with anything.  We weren't that impressed with the Concierge staff, although friendly, they didn't seem very knowledgable and we weren't happy with their recommendations.  For example, they recommended Elephant & Castle for breakfast one morning which was average at best so instead the next day I researched and found a fantastic place for breakfast- The Bakehouse (highly recommend!)  They also didn't have much information on Irish dancing which seems like it would be a popular tourist attraction.  Our best restaurant recommendation came from someone at the front desk who not only said it was her favorite but made sure we secured a reservation (restaurant was The Winding Stair which we all loved).  We enjoyed the afternoon tea- service was great, the food was nice (too much!), just wish we could have a selection of teas.  The Mint is a great place for food and drinks and once again the staff was very friendly.  Overall we would definitely return to the Westin but plan on doing our own research for meals.

TIP- Use Air Coach for airport transportation- 7 euros each way and on the return, there is a stop immediately across from the Westin.",4,2014,05,19
202,Great place to stay,"I booked this hotel as a special treat for my husbands 40th. We wasn't disappointed. Just far enough from temple bar noise, but near enough to still enjoy the atmosphere. The bed was unbelievably comfy like sleeping on a cloud. ",4,2014,05,19
202,Afternoon tea ... So so ,"My friend and I very recently had afternoon tea in the Westin as an engagement treat for my friend.

Very busy on the day which is always positive as creates a lovely vibe. We were given a lovely table and ordered very quickly.

Food was nice but we found it was not value for money. We had to ask for water three times, no offer to replenish tea/coffee. No one checked if we needed anything else. In terms of food, there was slightly too much sweet and just not enough options for sandwiches etc. 

At 32e per person, it's not worth it considering the fab sunday lunch you would have in places such as Rolys etc for that price. 

Maybe we just picked the wrong day but dont think I would go back to retry at that price.

",3,2014,05,18
202,Great hotel in perfect location,"Large rooms, clean and well appointed.  Comfortable beds.  Great front desk staff who were accommodating to our early arrival after an all night flight.  Only one issue -- one of our friends was given an adjoining room and could hear every word, laugh next door as if they were in her room.  Little disappointing.  Not very well sound proofed.  Only recommendation would be to ask for a room that's not connected to another one.",5,2014,05,16
202,"Excellent service, great location","I travel all over the EU and US, been doing it for 25 years and this is the BEST hotel I've ever stayed in. When I need help with something they really try to help, not just give lip service. I visit Dublin at least once a month and I consider it a home away from home.",5,2014,05,15
202,A great hotel in a central location,My son and I stayed here in April of this year and found the hotel and its location to be ideal for everything we wanted to do. It was quiet and the staff were couteous. We even had a nice view of Trinity College from our room. We were within walking distance of the typical touristy things like Guinness and Jameson but far enough removed from Temple Bar and the drunk college students when we wanted to be!,4,2014,05,14
202,Best choice ever!,We stayed in the Westin for a 6 day trip to Ireland and could not have made a better choice. The location was terrific. Close enough to night life at temple bar area yet removed enough to be away from the noise. Short walk to everything. We toured the city by foot and never had a problem. Tour buses for day tours meet a few blocks away and transportation to the airport via the airbus is right across the steer. The staff were all welcoming and extremely helpful. I wouldn't stay anywhere else only next trip to Ireland. ,5,2014,05,13
202,Terrific location with great service,"Stayed at this property with my husband at the end of Jan '14 for a long weekend. The hotel is centrally located, within walking distance to many Dublin attractions including Grafton St., Temple Bar, and Trinity College. Lots of great pubs and dining options within walking distance.  The front desk staff was extremely helpful and accommodating. We arrived very early on a Friday morning from an overnight flight from Boston and we were able to check into our room upon arrival, as the room was already ready. My only complaints are around the quality of the food available at the hotel. I found the room service menu to be lacking in variety and the quality of the food sub par, especially after 10pm and the breakfast buffet in the restaurant was just ok. However, with so many great dining options within walking distance or a quick cab ride away, it shouldn't impact anyone's decision to stay at the Westin.",4,2014,05,13
202,Love this hotel,"I love this hotel, home away from home. Have stayed here 3 times! Super friendly staff & helpful with any problems/questions. The breakfast buffet it amazing and the bar in the basement has a cool underground vibe. Centrally located for hop on hop off bus, attractions and Temple Bar district. Will def stay here again!!",5,2014,05,13
202,Business Trip,"I took a business trip to Dublin in March and stayed for the first time at the Westin.
Firstly, location is excellent, good restaurants and pubs are within walking distance. Check in took slightly longer than I wanted, but room was very big (and quiet given that you are in the middle of the city). Stay were pleasant, check out was easier....as a business traveller the cost was not high on my list of priorities, but everything else stacked up. - Great location for going to meetings.",5,2014,05,13
202,Fantastic location. Very friendly,"Good rooms, great location and very friendly staff.  We had room on fourth floor in the front.  Noise was not an issue. Was there for fun but probably a good business choice as well.  Walking distance for all central Dublin.   Grafton street to the south and the river to the north.  Next to trinity college. Also across street from temple bar if that is your type of area.  ",5,2014,05,12
202,"overly, overly price, horrible night manager","For the price you pay to stay in this hotel, it's totally not worth it, granted the location is great, but the service is substandard. The desk and night stand in the room was dusty, internet connection (free in the lobby but 15 euros in the room per day) was inconsistent.

Worse of all, their night manager , a very short (perhaps less than 5 feet 2 inches, 160 cm) was rude, arrogant, non-helpful.",1,2014,05,10
202,Excellent Property Centrally located,"We chose The Westin Dublin for its location and all the expectations that the brand has consistently delivered for us.  We arrived from the US very early on a Saturday morning from Boston.  Because we had booked a suite the availability of ready rooms at arrival was non-existent.  We were given keys to a ""waiting room"" with couches/chairs/tv and offered access to the fitness center if we wanted.  We opted to just relax in the room.   Around noon we were able to check into our suite.  

The room was very nice with all of the little extras we have come to expect from top quality hotels.  After freshening up we took the hop on/hop off tour recommended by the concierge.  The pick up and drop off points were just steps from the hotel.

On Saturday night there was a small bit of crowd noise from some late night partying near that college.  With the  curtains drawn and TV on we were not disturbed.

The Mint Bar was beautiful.  Be sure to try the ""sampler"" Flight of Drinks.  The staff was kind enough to educate me on the brands and why they were specifically selected.

We had dessert in the Atrium area one evening.  Again service was above expectation and the food was great.

The morning breakfast buffet was a big surprise with all of the choices for both hot and cold foods.

When making our reservation I let the hotel know we were celebrating an anniversary.  While we were out for dinner a beautiful piece of cheesecake was delivered acknowledging our event.

If you stay in enough hotels they eventually all seem the same.  The service is the big difference.  The Westin Dublin has set the bar high for others to follow.",5,2014,05,07
202,Lunch with friend,"Paid a visit to this hotel for lunch, first impressions are great, lovely flowers in the foyer, we had lunch in the Mint Bar. This is a very comfortable place with subdued lighting and has a lovely relaxed feeling. We had a seafood platter and an open sandwich, we asked the waitress for two small plates to share the food. Both meals were gorgeous, very well presented and really tasty. We also had a glass of merlot each, the wine was quite expensive but the food was very reasonable for the quality.",5,2014,05,06
202,Adjoining room for family with 2 teens,"Great location and accommodations.  Hotel appears to have been recently redone on the inside.  Some construction was ongoing on the outside.  Perfect connecting rooms for a family of four with teen boy and girl.  Dining options in the hotel were somewhat limited, but not bad.  Very good location, walking distance to most points of interest.",5,2014,05,06
202,An Elite Choice In Central Dublin,"A GLORIOUS hotel - with a wonderful, impressive d√©cor of both charm and comfort. BEWARE - as at the front of the hotel there is evidence of some heavy roadworks starting (they are preparing a new Tram line). I did hear drilling. It would have been nice to have been greeted by Irish people at reception- instead of 3 Polish people !! ROOMS - was first of all put into a room on 1st floor with Kingsize bed, overlooking the Atrium (a lovely relaxing seating area for drinks and light snacks). I was told the windows could open - WRONG ! Shame cos the room was both very dark and I had to rely on the AC for fresh air. If you are like me, I cannot get on with AC and the next day had the effects of a cold and felt awful ! I asked to move to a room where I could both open a window and feel some fresh air coming into the room ! I was then moved to a 2nd floor room at the front of the hotel (even though I was told it would be at the side). This room had a double bed - but what I call a large double. Rooms to the front, especially on a Fri and a Sat night are so so noisy (mainly cos of the bustling night life of Temple Bar just opposite). People were still laughing, shouting, screaming up until 5am !! Internet is absolutely pricey and not worth it in my eyes - Euros 35 for 3 days, or Euros 15 p/day. If you are in the rooms overlooking the Atrium though, you will get FREE Wifi - as there is Free Wifi in the Lobby and Atrium area !. The Buffet breakfast is to die for ! A vast array of foods to suit all and fit for a King !! Don't forget to ask for eggs to be made in different ways, other than the scrambled that is already there - it's included in your Breakfast card. Also - you can ask for a Latte, or a Cappuccino that is NOT an extra charge. The Pancake machine is such a brilliant idea and I want one (¬£2,000 to purchase though) !! You press a button and out comes 2 circular pancakes that are yummy ! The Mint Bar is a great place for an evening meal, a vast array of drinks and entertainment too from 9pm. I had a great fish meal. The rooms have everything you need from tea/coffee making facilities, to a bath and great shower, to an array of good mirrors (including a telescopic one in bathroom). 1 dressing gown was a bit odd for 2 people ?! The beds are so so comfortable though. The mattress is firm but so so soft and there is a soft, or firm pillow to choose from. Loved the green soap in the shape of a Shamrock !! The maids clean the rooms well - no dust or ugliness under the bed !! Finally the Concierge were both Irish and most helpful. They helped to book me onto a day trip to the Wicklow Mountains (well worth doing). Trinity College just 2 mins walk away - see the Library with the Book of Kells. The Wax Museum (just 5 mins walk away) well worth a visit. I really recommend the Hop On And Off Sightseeing Bus - to give you an overall idea of all the sights. Most of the Irish pubs have live bands. The Ashlington Hotel and Bar had live Irish dancing that was good and then there was a band that took over the entertainment. Kathmandu Kitchen restaurant was a great eatery - for fantastic Nepalese/Indian food (Dame St). Shopping on Grafton Street was good for Designer clothes, but there are other shopping streets too. The Gaiety Theatre was a delight to see a Comedy there (Breaking Dad). The theatre is small, old but full of character.",5,2014,05,06
202,Good choice for Dublin with a few exceptions...,"We stayed 4 nights in a deluxe king room...

Pros:  1) Great location - within walking distance to all major attractions, restaurants, pubs and shopping 2) Excellent service from all staff  3) Room - nice decor, the usual comfortable Westin bed and a large marble bathroom.

Cons: 1) Internet is $35 Euro for 3 days‚Ä¶it was free everywhere else we stayed in Ireland over our 3 week vacation  2) Breakfast was not good or good value for $ - there are plenty of other great places to eat within a few blocks 3) Our room faced Fleet Street which was under construction (noisy all day), was directly above a pub (noisy until 3 AM), and opposite an office building (nice view of people working).  In other words, be sure to ask about where your ""deluxe room"" is located within the hotel.",4,2014,05,05
202,Odd. One bathrobe and breakfast token for 1!!,Booked a room for two guests only one bathrobe and a single breakfast token provided. Otherwise it was very pleasant and enjoyable. Nice location with good rooms. Clean. Lobby a bit sterile. Food nice. Why the pancake machine. It really takes from the ambience. ,4,2014,05,01
202,"Stayed one night. GREAT service, meticulously clean hotel.","We only stayed one night in this hotel and I had booked it with SPG points for only 12000 points.
Check in was extremely smooth and the front desk staff was helpful with all of our questions about the hotel and the area.  The front desk staff are seasoned and prefessional.
Our room was very nice.  We had a king bed that was very comfortable.  The room was extremely dark at night while sleeping which I love.
The bathroom was 5 star in my opinion.  One of the nicest bathrooms I have personally had in a hotel room.  Huge bathtub and great shower, both separate. The hardware throughour the rooms was 5 star and nicer than anythign we have in our home. The water glasses were so clean you couldn't see a speck of dust on them.
Although we only stayed one night we were very impressed.",5,2014,05,01
202,"Excellent staff,,great location","Recently stayed at the Westin Dublin for 4 nights and loved it. Great location as you are right in the heart of Temple Bar, so there are  many pubs/restaurants to choose from within walking distance. Grafton street and Trinity College are also right there.  The staff was incredibly attentive, especially Laszlow Martin (Concierge) who booked tours for us, reconfirmed tours we had already booked, sent us a text while we were out and about one day to let us know everything was set up for our Irish House party. Whenever we requested a bucket of ice for our room, it was brought up very quickly and we even had ice waiting in our room for us upon returning in the afternoon from touring!
 Rooms were quite large and very clean,,everything very modern, beds very comfortable.
Excellent property!",5,2014,04,29
202,Great Location in Dublin!,"We spent 2 days in Dublin at the Westin.  It was a very comfortable stay in a superior location!  We were steps to Temple Bar, Trinity College and Grafton Street.  The room was modern, well decorated and the bed very comfortable.  The bathroom was enormous for a bathroom in a city hotel!!!  And well appointed.  I had tea with my daughters there on Monday afternoon and it was very nice in the mezzanine lounge.  We would definitely stay here again when we go back to Dublin!",5,2014,04,27
202,"Excellent location, helpful staff","My daughter and I stayed here as we kicked off our trip to Ireland.  Overall the hotel is wonderful.  The location is excellent - across the street from Temple Bar (which can get a little rowdy) and Trinity College, just a walk away from Grafton Street and great restaurants on Fade street.  Our room had an interior view, but it really didn't matter, it was still plenty roomy, clean and tastefully decorated.  The staff was friendly and helpful and if I'm ever in Dublin again I would definitely stay here.",5,2014,04,27
202,Old World Charm,"I had a business conference and was fortunate enough to get a room at the Westin.  Its location is excellent, across the street from the Temple Bar area, and Trinity College, and within walking distance of Grafton Street headed south, and the pedestrian zone north of the Liffe.  The staff was great, and rooms clean and spacious...very spacious by European standards.  The breakfast is ample, though a little pricey, but there are plenty of coffee shops and restaurants nearby.  The Mint Bar in the basement has a wonderful selection of Irish Whiskey and Kentucky Bourbon (they automatically would get 4 stars just for carrying Woodford Reserve).  
You will feel like you are on the Grand Tour of Europe due to the character of the building inside and out, but all the amenities are modern.  The bathroom had a shower AND a separate bath tub.  Dublin is a wonderful city, and while the hotel is not economical, it is worth every penny.",5,2014,04,25
202,A fine hotel,"Travelling on an American Express Fine Hotels and Resorts Package out reservation was made by Amex. 

We encountered some minor problems during check in, but the General Manager stepped in and resolved the situation. Our room was excellent as is the location of the hotel. Great for shopping or those looking to listen to live traditional music. Well priced and highly recommended. Hotel staff extremely helpful!

Great for business or leisure in the heart of Dublin.",5,2014,04,25
202,Amazing Staff,"Recently me and my friend/coworker had the opportunity to take a vacation for a two-week getaway. During this time we spend about 4-5 nights at your property where we were nothing but pleased.

The highlight of this lovely hotel for us would have to be the staff. SPECIFICALLY CIARA AND STEFAN for their top notch service. From our first night there at the bar where we enjoyed a very good meal and cocktails Ciara had been nothing but splendid- she always remembered us by name every night there after. She always had a smile on her face even when we seemingly bombarded her for HER help alone! (We just loved her!) We were down at the bar for dinner several nights and we saw that she had just as much enthusiasm for ALL her guests not just us! She even helped suggest things to do- please pass on our gratitude and thanks to this lovely lady!

In further regards to traveling around the city- Stefan the concierge was not only friendly and helpful- but every time we saw him he knew how to make us laugh while always remaining professional. We always had a million questions and Stefan always met every single one of them with the utmost help and patience from what to see-where to go- and where to shop for what. Please let him know he is a lovely ""lad"" and we wished all concierges were as helpful as he was!

The hotel was beautiful and the entire staff was very kind! Some other great members of the staff were Linda- Thank you for the lovely room you helped us get facing the street for the St. Patty's parade! Neal for all your kindness at the desk- he even gave us pointers on Scotland as he knew we were traveling there! Peter at the concierges- he spent some time helping me try to find a Western Union  when an ATM swallowed my debit card! And Seamous for always being so nice and helpful at the bar even when he knew we were coming to bother Ciara! 

And finally Jacquelyn one of the front office managers at the desk- we were never fortunate enough to meet her but one night when we arrived back to our room we had a lovely amenity and note waiting for us! 

While we loved the hotel it really was the associates who made our stay the most memorable. We will be back as soon as we can!",5,2014,04,21
202,Sublime!,Staying at the  Westin is a wonderful experience from start to finish. The staff are friendly and very professional. The rooms are spacious and very comfortable.The beds are perfect!  Mint has an extensive cocktail list and they live up to expectations. The location of the hotel is perfect for shopping in both Grafton st and Henry st. We will definitely be returning!!,5,2014,04,20
202,Good,"I have to be honest and say I was a little disappointed by the hotel after seeing the flashy website and having planned a trip to Dublin I decided to use SPG points to make an award stay. 
Checkin was quick and good and all the staff I dealt with were warm and friendly, the building is also really nice. The room itself was up to the normal Westin standard although the window was small so despite being on an upper floor the room felt like I was in a basement. Overall, I think there are better ""real"" 5* hotels in Dublin.",4,2014,04,20
202,VERY NICE PLACE TO STAY,"Unfortunately, I was only one evening in Dublin.  The Westin is a wonderful place to stay.  The location if fabulous right accross the "" Irish Pub Street"".  Restaraunts in every price class are available within a short walking distance.  The hotel is has old school charm.  The service is fantastic and the rooms are well done and very comfortable.  I did not have time to use the spa or pool.",5,2014,04,20
202,Westin,"Overall, a great experience at the Westin! Room, bed and bath were all outstanding. Staff was ver y good. My only negative was the construction outside of the hotel which made for difficulty in bringing the car around for check in. However, the staff was ultimately helpful in accomplishing this task. Location is very central to touring the city. The Atrium lounge is very nice for a very relaxing tea or libation. I would stay here again!!",5,2014,04,20
202,"Excellent experience, not far from perfect","I've been travelling to Dublin quite a lot for the past few months for business purposes and have always stayed at the Westin because of its great location and value.
The sleep experience is absolutely wonderful, the heavenly bed being really heavenly. The staff is very nice and helpful, especially Neil, one of the receptionists.

On the negative side, the deco in the rooms is a bit dated, very classic and not very welcoming.

Also, I'm a bit disappointed by the fact that despite being there regularly and being known by the staff, I haven't enjoyed any upgrade or particular attention as I would have expected from an hotel of this standing.

Overall, an excellent hotel but lacking the extra touch to get a 5 star rating.",4,2014,04,20
202,Great location,Beautiful room overlooking Trinity. The beds are soo comfortable.  Absolutely great location for shopping 5 minutes to Grafton and Henry St. Fantastic restaurants nearby. Staff at the Westin were excellent. Room was ready at 10 am very impressed.,5,2014,04,20
202,Fantastic,"Had a great stay, the staff from the minute we arrived were extremely friendly and helpful, our room was a little small, but had the most comfortable bed I've stayed in :-)
Rooms were a bit hot for me, so had the air con all most of the time.
The cocktails in Mint Bar were gorgeous, the one I wanted wasn't on their list, and when i asked the staff they made it for me, no problems :-)
Had Lunch in the Mint bar and the food was great, simple good ingredients, cooked well and served in a lovely setting... what more would you want.",5,2014,04,18
202,Highly Recommend,"We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at the Westin. Our room was fantastic and had a large bathroom with a separate shower and tub. It was our anniversary stay and I noted it when making our reservation but made no mention when we checked in and they delivered a delicious dessert to our room for our anniversary. Every staff member we encountered was great and went above and beyond. The location is the best in Dublin and we walked everywhere. I have a hobby of enjoying afternoon tea all over the world in five star hotels and the ""most peculiar afternoon tea"" was the best one I have ever experienced. I highly recommend it, I made reservations a few weeks in advance, it books up quickly and I can see why. We also enjoyed some drinks in the Mint Bar and it was the perfect place for a nightcap.  I can not recommend this hotel enough we will definitely be returning!",5,2014,04,16
202,Same good experience as my stay a year ago; still shy of five stars,"I could almost write my review from last year word for word. After staying at a non-Westin property immediately prior to this stay, I greatly appreciated the Heavenly Bed and the White Tea bath products. At check-in, they provided keys to the wrong room; a staff member was immediately up to bring me the correct key/room combination (which I appreciated; it was quite late and saved me a trip back downstairs with luggage). The room had a good view; it was tucked into a corner, so it felt larger than average (even if it wasn't - hard to tell). I was thinking I could indeed rate the hotel 5-stars until my breakfast shortly before departure. I ordered a la carte, and my order took far longer than necessary - I was served after two other guests who were seated and ordered after me. Overall, though, this is a good Westin property and in a great location, walkable to Temple Bar and across the street from Trinity College.",4,2014,04,13
202,Great Location,"My husband and I stayed in Jan for a weekend away. As Adam is SPG platinum we were a bit disappointed on arrival when we were just shown to our standard room but as soon as we checked this with other staff member they apologised and we were shown to a super two level suite. The location of this hotel is great for exploring and we are always pleased with the Westin's great quality of rooms and amenities. Staff were really friendly, especially in the atrium where we had a lovely afternoon tea. I was poorly during our staff and staff were very helpful. The bar was closed for renovations whilst we were there but it looked like something to come back for soon ! 

All in all a great hotel with a great location  ",4,2014,04,13
202,Everything you need,"Nice location. Friendly staff. Great breakfast. Clean and comfortable rooms. Great fitness center. Good facilities for business meetings. Modern but with a vintage touch. And beautiful fresh flowers all over. 

Only negative was double bed a bit small for Scandinavians ",5,2014,04,06
202,Wonderful Westin,"The services provided by the Concierge were incredible, by the front desk staff good, and by housekeeping staff fantastic.  A housekeeper even escorted me, carrying my luggage, to find the business center which is marked incorrectly on hotel signage.  The property is spotless and has just had much carpet replaced.  Location is fabulous as you can discover on a map.  What you can't, and won't, find on a map, however, is the fact that light rail construction is occurring DIRECTLY in front of the hotel making for NOISE and DIFFICULTIES entering the hotel's main entrance.  I understand the hotel can't do a thing about this project that will ultimately connect the two existing light rail lines, but it is presently a pain.  Once up and running in a year plus, I wonder how this will impact the sounds and vibrations in the property?  Time will tell.",4,2014,04,06
202,perfection,The hotel and rooms are beautiful and immaculate. The staff is charming and responsive. My wife and I could not have had a more wonderful vacation then staying at the Westin Dublin. Besides the fabulous hotel the location is outstanding. If you want to have the best experience in Dublin this is the place to stay,5,2014,04,05
202,Busy But Convenient Location,"My husband stayed 4 nights at the Westin Dublin.  It was very nice of the staff to welcome us with some nice desserts as we were celebrating our anniversary and birthday for this stay. The staff was prompt with their replies in earlier communications and very warm and welcoming upon check-in.
The hotel is at the heart of the city center.  Across the street from the hotel entrance is Temple Bar area where restaurants and pubs abound.  On the other side of the hotel is Trinity College and right around from it is the Ireland Discover Center where you can book tours and pick up locations for day tours. The hotel is in a very busy street, however, it made for a most convenient location for us.  The Aircoach stop (to go to airport) is directly across the hotel entrance so leaving there at 5am was a breeze.
The room was very clean as you can expect from a Westin hotel.  The bed is definitely heavenly that afforded us many good nights sleep.  The big bathtub was put to good use after days of sightseeing and walking around Dublin.
Our only peeve is that there is no free wi-fi in the room.  I suppose it's time for management to reconsider this as even an airport bus provides free wi-fi these days.
All in all, we had a nice stay and will consider staying here again!",4,2014,03,31
202,A restful stay,We enjoyed a restful stay here. The staff was accommodating; they quickly got the first room available for us after a long flight that arrived ahead of schedule. Both the room and bathroom were spacious and we got a great night's sleep in the Heavenly bed!,5,2014,03,29
202,Great informal business meeting venue !,First floor mezzanine coffee/dining area serves a limited but good quality selection of sweet and savoury dishes...all in a comfortable setting with plenty of informally laid out chairs and tables. Conversation with a degree of privacy is therefore attainable. Polite and attentive service.  A 25 minute Aircoach ride from Dublin airport at a return cost of ‚Ç¨12 drops you one block away from the hotel lobby...which is minutes walk away from both Grafton and O'Connell Streets.,4,2014,03,27
202,Amazing Location,"Hotel was absolutely amazing.  

Our flight from Canada arrived at 8am in the morning so by the time we arrived at the hotel, it was too early to check-in.  We were ushered to the Atrium Lounge where we ended up staying for the next 4 hours because our room wasn't ready.  Understandable.  The earliest room that was available had no view, so we waited for a room with a view since it was our first trip to Dublin. 

The bed was comfortable and the bathroom was beautiful.  The service was excellent.  The gent at the Atrium gave me a free pint of Guinness! :)  

We had no complaints during our 10 day stay at The Westin.  Everything was great from the service to the architecture, decor and especially the location.  It's unbeatable.  Right by Trinity College and in the heart of Dublin.  Walking distance to the Tourist Offices and all the major bus stops to the airport and everything else.",5,2014,03,27
202,Great Hotel,"What an absolutely great hotel.  The history of the hotel is very interesting due to the fact that it use to be a bank and the hotel bar is called the Mint because that was the banks vault.  The service is top notch and you can't beat the location.  If you are looking for an upscale hotel, this is the place to be.  If you are not looking for upscale, do yourself a favor and spend the couple extra Euros and stay here.  Thank you Westin Dublin for a great experience while we visited Ireland for the first time.",5,2014,03,26
202,Perfect Location,"Stayed at this hotel for the weekend, everyone was very helpful, the location is perfect for visiting Dublin, close to the shopping area, restaurants and site seeing. Breakfast is good, rooms are a good size, would stay at this hotel again.",5,2014,03,25
202,"Ticks all boxes, apart from the Mezzanine loo!","Great beds, rooms, service and location. One slight problem, the loos have plenty of water but it may be how they are vented (I'm no plumber) but they don't do what it says on the label; remove the waste. A visitor obviously decided not to bother as the gents on the Mezzanine floor left me retching; enough said. Spoilt a good trip. Sadly I was leaving at that moment and had a car waiting and was too distressed to tell a member of staff.",4,2014,03,25
202,St Patrick's celebration,"It was our first time in Ireland, and Westin Dublin was an undoubtedly great choice!

Centrally located, walking distance to majority of the tourists attractions and local pubs, with great service and knowledgable and willing to help concierge.

Our room was facing the main street which allowed us the best view to watch the parade!

We also dinned at the Atrium and had drinks at the Mint Bar - both wonderful experiences!

The restaurant was closed during our visit but we will definitely try it out on the next visit!

Special mention to the wonderful front desk staff and batsmen at the mint bar - thank you!",5,2014,03,19
202,"Great Hotel, Great Location","After a few days in another hotel,  I was able to move to the Westin.  This is a beautiful hotel.  The rooms are large and very nice.  The staff was excellent.  The location puts you within walking distance of a large number of sites and it is right on the bus route.  I would highly recommend staying here.",5,2014,03,19
202,Best bed In The world!!!,"I travelled to Dublin for the St Patricks day parade and after a horrible first night in another hotel I found the westin online with availability and booked it. 
I am so glad I stayed there it was a fantastic central location, service from all staff was amazing and the bed was the best bed I have ever slept in!!!!
I had room service one night after a 14 hour tour to the giants cause way which was speedy service, arrived hot and tasted great. 
The bathroom was huge!! All marble with a big bath and shower and all the amenities you expect from a hotel of this calibre. If I was to go back to Dublin I would stay again.",5,2014,03,17
202,Best business hotel ever,"I travel a lot on business travel in Asia, Australasia and the US. This hotel exceeded my expectation in so many ways. The rooms are very tastefully decorated and the bed was even more heavenly than any other Westin heavenly bed that I've experienced. The workout room was compact but had everything you need for a full workout. The bar is so cool and serves fabulous cocktails and is the perfect place to wind down after a full day of meetings. Special mention of the staff should be noted - they were kind, helpful and called me by name when they saw me around the property. Can't wait to return and bring my family next time!",5,2014,03,17
202,Near perfect place to stay in Dublin,"Wonderfully located hotel, central yet without the drawbacks of other city centre hotels. One of the most comfortable beds I have ever slept in, truly fantastic. The staff are really helpful.
The Mint Bar is well designed, unusual and works well, apart from the fact that all the tables seemed to be reserved early in the evening on Saturday night making it difficult for residents. We returned late in the evening to find a really good band playing and a great atmosphere.

Minor niggles were; the room had no view at all apart from a 12 foot high roof immediately outside the window - a new room was immediately found and much better - why let yourself down and offer this room when another without this problem is readily available?
The light levels in the room and bathroom were poor (a theme with many hotels), my wife commented that putting on make-up was awkward for that reason.

I would definitely return to this hotel next time in Dublin",4,2014,03,11
202,Always enjoy staying at the Westin Dublin,"We have stayed at the Westin Dublin a few times and we always enjoy it. It is a beautiful hotel with a great location. 
We came back to stay one night on March 1st and this time it was the first time we came to stay as a family since we brought our son. I had arranged to have a cot in the room about a week before our stay with the reception. When we arrived we noticed that there was no bedding in the cot so we called the service desk and were told that it would be brought up straight away. We then received a call a few minutes later telling us that the hotel does not provide bedding for the cots for liability reasons. So they were expecting our baby to sleep on a hard mattress without even a cover.. I wish we would have at least been informed of this when I booked the cot, so that we could have brought our own things, Now we had to go out and buy it, which felt like a waste of money and time. 
We also booked a delux room hoping that we would have a room a bit more spacious than the standard rooms but the room we got was very small and with the cot in the room there was no space left at all basically.
We still really like this hotel but this stay was a bit disappointing to us and it became a hassle to have to go out and find a store that sells bedding for cots when we had lots of other things planned for our visit to Dublin already.",4,2014,03,06
202,"Perfect location, excellent service.","Our stay at the Westin began while we were still in the US.  The Concierge spoke/emailed with us several times regarding our dinner/tea reservations and tour plans.  This really helped us maximize our time in Dublin as well as assuring us that we have successfully planned a wonderful trip.  Hotel was clean, beautiful and very comfortable.  Staff was lovely.  I would recommend it enthusiastically.",5,2014,03,06
202,Charming hotel,"We stayed here in March 2013. What a surprise - we didn't really expect the Westin Dublin to be as nice as it was. When we arrived, we were greeted warmly and shown to our room. We were in the Oscar Wilde room, which was unlike any other hotel room I have ever been in. It was actually bilayer, with the bed and bathroom on the first level and a winding staircase leading to an office and reading area on the second level. Very charming. I also loved the location - we were able to walk to everything we wanted to see (including the beautiful St Stephens Green), excellent pubs (and some fun touristy ones too like Temple Bar. mmm Bulmers), and some great shopping! The young lady that checked us in, I really wish I could remember her name becasue she deserves special recognition, was beyond helpful in assisting us with suitable dining options as my sister and husband are vegan. The places she recommended were spot on and I'm certain we wouldn't have had as lovely of a time in Dublin had it not been for her suggestions. Many thanks! If we return to Dublin, I am certain that we will stay at the Westin again!",5,2014,03,05
202,Did not meet expectations,"Arrived on an early flight from England and received a warm welcome from the concierge.  We were staying three nights with another couple and had booked two deluxe rooms.  On check in the receptionist was adamant that we had only booked classic rooms despite me handing over the booking confirmation showing two deluxe rooms.  We were offered an upgrade at additional cost if we wanted to check in straight away but we said we were happy just to leave our bags and we arranged for them to ring us when our rooms were ready.  Upon returning we were seen by another receptionists who gave us out keys and I checked with her that these were delux rooms.  She said no, we had only booked classic room! She asked for written evidence!  I said I had given our voucher to the other receptionist who now came across and denied having seen or taken the voucher!  Fortunately our friends had a copy in the luggage so they went to the classic room were our luggage was stored and retrieved this.  Only then did they concede we were right but it then took another fifteen minutes of much key tapping to allocate us the proper rooms.  

We received no information about where dinner or breakfast was served, no option to order a paper or early morning calls - all the things  you expect in a good hotel.

Thankfully the rooms were very nice.  However on the Sunday we returned at 4pm to find one of our rooms had not been serviced and our friends had to wait in the lobby for 30 mins whilst this was sorted.  We did take up the offer of four drinks to compensate in the mint bar. 

Breakfast was a very hit and miss affaire.  No one explained the ordering system to us so it was day two before we were asked if we would like to order different eggs other than the scrambled on offer.  The hot selection was very basic for the price and the sausages poor quality.  

We ordered porridge on one day and two fried eggs.  These duly arrived
At the same time - never had porridge and fried eggs together before!  Our friends ordered well done fried eggs but when they came they were under done to which the waitress replied that there isn't a button on the restaurant computer for well done.  

I have stayed in many good,quality hotels and spent 12 years of my career managing them, but I have to say this one was badly let down by disorganisation and a lack of customer focus on behalf of the reception staff.  The food and beverage manager really needs to sort out a more consistent approach to his breakfast service and how the staff inform guests of the service choices.  And please get rid of the breakfast tickets which you have to had in to get served.  We loved Dublin but should we return it will not be at the Westin.

",3,2014,03,04
202,Luxury in Dublin...but not perfect,"You expect any Westin property to be up to a certain standard and, in most ways, the Westin Dublin doesn't disappoint. It's got a great location right beside Trinity College and Grafton Street, and it has all the requisite luxury touches. We got a ‚Ç¨150 a night deal via a hotel booking site then took the ‚Ç¨40 upgrade offered at check-in for a larger room with balcony on the top floor.

The bedroom was excellent - spacious, very quiet, well equipped and with one of the best beds my wife and I have slept in. Couldn't fault it at all. What we also loved was the Westin Weekend concept, which allows extended check out up to 3.00 pm on Sundays, and a late breakfast option in the main restaurant. A brilliant product that others would do well to follow.

We had a couple of small negatives, though (which might not be worth mentioned in lower grade hotels but come into play at the Westin level). There was no evening turn down service, so no fresh towels or toiletries to replace the used ones. The Sunday newspaper we specified at check in didn't materialise, and I had to go to a local newsagent to get one. And, when we went down to the Mint Bar for a drink before going out for dinner, we found most of the tables reserved. Unusual, we felt, for a hotel bar but apparently not unusual here. It doesn't do much to encourage residents to feel at home, though. We got a place to sit, by the way, after a delay.

Small points, perhaps, but the Westin faces plenty of competition at the top end in Dublin.....from the likes of the Shelbourne, the Merrion, Four Seasons, Conrad, etc. An eye on detail is essential.",4,2014,03,03
202,Splendid spot,"Loved the Westin.  Stayed there a week and had a great stay. Great staff, very professional, wonderful concierge staff, lovely wait staff.  From check in to check out an uplifting experience. Perfect location for exploring Dublin.  Thanks for a wonderful stay!
",5,2014,02,28
202,The Warmest Of Welcomes,"As a previous guest at this hotel, I knew that it would be the warmest of welcomes,and despite being in a busy location overlooking Trinity College an oasis of calm. This time however I was travelling with a disabled guest.  My confidence that The Westin would be able to take care of us was very well placed

From the moment of booking,  Jacqueline took care of our requirements,  selecting us a perfect room and making sure everything else was perfect. On arrival we were greeted by the doorman with the warmth of an old friend,  relieved of our bags and made instantly comfortable.

We were in a Writers Room, which was bright,  extremely clean and very comfortable.  I loved the selection of Irish Literature to browse (shame not to have Roddy Doyle in our selection) and the views overlooking Trinity College towards the Aviva Stadium were stunning.  The beds are the most comfortable I have ever slept in bar none. 

The facilities within the hotel are lovely. Every member of staff greets you with a smile,  and without exception seem committed to ensuring that every guest has the best experience possible. The location is perfect. As well as the College, it is a stones throw from the river,  the shops,  Temple Bar,  if you fancy an entertaining stroll, Fleet Street (opposite the hotel entrance) contains the Icon Walk,  brilliant street art about the best of Irish Culture.  We spent a lovely evening in The Mint Bar enjoying their delicious cocktails. 

The best tip I can give,  is to make use of the hotel to book an airport taxi.  We would normally travel by bus,  but this time pre booked via reception,  paid a very competitive 22 euros, many thanks to the charming doorman for telling us about this service. 

I cannot recommend this Hotel highly enough.  It may not be the cheapest,  but it's absolutely worth the extra.  We would like to thank everyone at The Westin for making our visit so special.  We can't wait to return. Very soon!",5,2014,02,27
202,Nice hotel in good location,"The Westin, Dublin met all of our expectations.  We arrived around 3pm, our room was not quite ready, so we went down to the Mint Bar for a quick snack.  

Linda at the front desk was quite welcoming, recognizing my Lifetime Platinum Status.  She also met us in the bar with our keys once the room was ready and had our bags already sent to the room.

We arrived at our corner room on the 4th floor with a nice, but small balcony.  The room was as expected, clean and comfortable.

Unfortunately The Exchange restaurant was closed for dinner due to renovations, but the Mint Bar provided adequate selections for a light dinner.  The bar staff was very pleasant.

Overall, the hotel is in a great location in the city centre.  Next to Trinity College and Temple Bar District.

My only complaint was the late night dining menu.  It's very limited.  Fortunately there is a Subway across the street that we resorted to for a midnight snack.  (Mind you, midnight for us was really 6pm on our body clocks).

When returning to Dublin, we would not hesitate to return to the Westin.",4,2014,02,24
202,Wonderful.,"We stayed here for an eveing last week and it was truly a lovely hotel. The Reception was charming and the staff friendly. We were offered help with the bags to the room although declined as we were travelling light athough I did see a number of guests being escorted with baggage trolleys.

Bedrooms were a good size, and the bed was unbelievably comfortable!! Bathroom was wonderfully decorated and clean, with plenty of towels. 

We booked in for afternoon tea on arrival which is really reccommended - wonderful cakes, savories and prosecco if you wish. It was fairly busy when we were there but we did notice on our way to check-out the next day that there was a large group of pint-drinking men either on a stag party or some other event and there was a semi-naked man with facepaint on! Funny to see but not certainly something I'd wish to be part of if im sitting down for an afternoon tea in a 5* hotel!! 

The location was fantastic - a two minute walk from the main shopping street. So if you're new to Dublin, a brilliant base.

The only downside to this hotel is lack of free wifi. I belive it was 15euro per day. We stay in many 4/5* and have rarely come across a charge for something which seems so basic these days, especially for tourists who may not be able to access 3G on another country.

A lovely stay, we would certainly return.",5,2014,02,24
202,Great hotel where they do things really well,"We stayed here for a Saturday night, in town for a treat restaurant and wanted to be able to keep the night going.
Valet car parking starts the stay. 
Lovely room all newly decorated with the smell of new carpet reassuring rather than imposing. Plenty of space, comfortable bed, docking station in the clock radio, lovely high spec bathroom.

Busy Saturday afternoon means the delightful atrium lounge full up and the mint bar more of a night place.
Staff very helpful and friendly. 
Bar band in mint after coming back from the restaurant were outstanding, singer Amy Kelly at her best belting out Adele's rolling in the deep, band really getting into the groove. Great gig nice friendly customers.

Got the car back and inside a handwritten thank you note and a bottle of water for the drive..
This is a real 5 star and a great and gracious city hotel. More dubliners should use it.",5,2014,02,23
202,Was the perfect place,"This is a great hotel located in the perfect place for walking around Dublin.  The room was quite lovely and we did not pay for a view but it was fine looking at the rooftops because we did not spend much time in the room.

The restaurant/bar just at the entrance had great breakfast buffets and the manhattan my husband had one afternoon was very unique and he loved it.

You can easily walk up to Trinity College, Fleet Street, Grafton Street...all great areas to wander around.  The staff at the hotel were very friendly and I did have laundry done there which was nicely done.",5,2014,02,22
202,A perfect spot,"a nice hotel right in the heart of dublin,across the road from temple bar,all the lively pubs,lots of restaurant down temple area,the guinness tour is an experiance not to be missed about a 15 minute walk,lots of coffee bars very close,staff very friendly and helpfull,its about 10 kilometers from airport to hotel 18 euros,i would stay here again but when its warmer,a great place.",4,2014,02,21
202,Loved It!,"This was my first stop in my ""backpacking"" journey through the U.K.  The bar on the lower level makes the most amazing espresso martinis and the restaurant connected to the Westin was amazing too!  They lock you out after 11pm so you have to get the front desk person to let you back in!",5,2014,02,20
202,"Great location, but some areas for improvement","The Westin is in a very convenient location just south of the river and two minutes from Trinity College.  I was upgraded to a superior room, which was a comfortable size and nicely finished in a more classic style.  While the bed was very comfortable, I didn't like the bedding at all.  The comforter was way too heavy, and having the flat sheets rather than a duvet cover just made things a mess.  Despite this, I still slept well as the rooms are well insulated for sound.

What really annoyed me about the hotel is the spotty wifi.  It's just about useless if you're really trying to get work done -- slow and you get periodically disconnected.  What made things worse was that wifi is supposed to be included in my company's rate, but the hotel didn't have a record of this and I got charged anyway.  It's just annoying to have to call our travel dept and have them sort it out.  And if you're going to charge so much for wifi, at least make sure it's fast and reliable!",3,2014,02,20
202,Great Customer Service,"The hotel is conveniently located in the heart of the city near Trinity College. The staff were friendly, and very accomodating to me. I got upgraded to a suite which had two floors. I only wish that besides seeing the picture of Samuel Beckett, there was a plaque honoring him informing guests what he wrote like Waiting for Godot. Plus the toilet had difficulty flushing, after eight times I contacted reception to tell them that the toilet was having problems. I received a note from a member of the staff that the toilet is working but, I still had problems with it.",4,2014,02,19
202,Excellent in Every Way,"Stayed at The Westin with work and held our mini conference there this week. I cannot compliment the staff enough - Rachel and Dominic amongst others were incredibly helpful and really couldn't do enough for us. The hotel is beautiful - once you have slept in the bed you will never want to leave!  The food was fabulous from breakfast with the snazzy pancake machine to lunch which offered a range of tasty options healthy and otherwise! Dinner in the Mint Bar was also excellent with the parmesan chips a real treat.
The location is first rate and great for all the main tourist attractions! Only thing missing was a swimming pool! I can't way to go back for pleasure!",5,2014,02,18
202,The Mint bar,"On a lovely day out in Dublin, my sister and me, stopped here for a cocktail, we were given a gin based cocktail in a china teacup and saucer, the staff were fantastic, lovely bar and very clean, we will be back.",5,2014,02,17
202,Fantastic stay in a great location,"I have been to Dublin before and cannot recommend this hotel enough. 
I went for a weekend break with my girlfriend for valentines and have had a brilliant stay. 
The staff are very friendly and attentive and the hotel and rooms are beautiful. 
Everything was in walking distance from the hotel yet far enough away from Temple Bar so as not to get disturbed. 
If you are looking for something classy in an excellent location with friendly staff you cannot go wrong by booking a stay at the Westin Dublin. 
I would also like to thank Kristina M. for being so helpful with my reservation. ",5,2014,02,17
202,nice location,"Clean comfortable room. Conveniently located across from Trinity college and a short walk to Temple bar and Dublin night life. Hotel staff were very accommodating and friendly.

 I don't ask for much but a clean room, a comfortable bed and friendly staff. All three met my expectations.",4,2014,02,15
202,A great central location and great for a weekend break,A weekend away in a great hotel in a great location with lovely rooms and very comfortable beds. The only downside was a hiccup with the breakfast service on the Saturday morning but the staff were very apologetic. Great for a weekend away and well worth a visit.,5,2014,02,15
202,Nice Hotel,"This hotel is a typical Westin property.  Comfy beds, great pillows, nicely appointed rooms.  It appears to be a newer property or at least a newly renovated property.  They do a nice tea service on the 2nd floor mezzanine and serve cocktails there as well.  The Mint Bar in the basement area also serves food and is really quite comfortable with good food and drink.  Overall I would say that this hotel is very well situated either for business or pleasure. The staff was pleasant and always accommodating.  We stayed at the hotel only one night so we did not get a chance to try out the spa services.",4,2014,02,14
202,Great place,"The building is fantastic, and the room superb. The place is very comfortable if you want to visit the City centre. However, there are works on the street when we visited it last summer. I like the amenities particulary. The people of the Hotel are very friendly.",4,2014,02,05
202,A lap of Luxury,"The Westin is an absolute magnificent hotel! Every last detail oozes class. The staff are polite helpful friendly and courteous.The room was amazing with not a single detail missed. The bed to was amazing. The most comfortable bed I have ever slept in. I had a truly 5 star experience. The Mint bar was fantastic. The cocktails were delicious And the food was second to none. If your thinking of luxury then i assure you this is the place for you. Its also located bang smack in the middle of Dublin with everything within walking distance.
It is a must for those of you who wish to experience a 5 star Hotel. I would recommend it to everyone. I also particularly liked the option to donate ‚Ç¨1 on checking out to UNICEF. Very nice to see it being offered as a service. 5 Stars",5,2014,02,04
202,"Great location,  higher end rooms, disappointing  service","I made reservations at the hotel for 2 rooms overnight from  February 2nd to 3rd.   This hotel is well located in Dublin close to the Liffey and Temple bar and other attractions in the city.  I am a platinum starwood member and generally choose Westin hotels over any other brand including other Starwood brands and my experience is generally very positive.   My customer experience at the Westin Dublin was the poorest  I have encountered in some years in any premium branded hotel across the Americas, Europe and Asia,  From the moment I walked through the door my high expectations of the Westin brand were not met as follows:

Attempted to check in at 11.30 AM ( this is early and generally is not a problem but certainly it is understandable that the room might not be ready).  I also understood  that the hotel was busy but when I inquired as to when we might be able to check in,  rather than the front desk being helpful so we could plan a few hours by  checking as to the status of the rooms a, check out time of the incumbent etc etc ,  I was reminded of the policy for check in was 3PM - ie I was read the policy!!.   This is not how to serve any customer in a premier branded hotel, more like a call center response for a budget airline!!!

The same check in clerk then went on to assure me that he would call me when either room was available.  I came back at 1.00 PM and was checked in only to get a call from the original clerk at 2.15PM to say my room was ready,  clearly good customer service was not high on the agenda. 

Generally on check in at a Starwood property,  the check in clerk will recognize the status of a member and explain the benefits at the hotel.  This did not happen 

AT 7PM,  I called to have the turn down service come and refresh the room and was assured that ""someone would be right up"".   I returned to the room after dinner at 10.30 to find that there had been no turn down service and therefore towels etc had not been replaced,  beds needed to be made,  drinking water not replenished

Called guest services in the morning to ask for a clothes brush.  Was told that they did not have one....a little surprising.

Breakfast at the hotel is the typical buffet style was the ability to order also,  service was polite although slow despite almost nobody in the restaurant at the time 

On check out,  my bill had 4 errors   3 charges for HSIA which is complementary for a platinum preferred member and an erroneous mini bar charge.  

My overall sense was the the hotel aspires to provide the type of service you could expect in a premier branded hotel situated in an international city but falls well short due to spotty service at best.",2,2014,02,04
202,Excellent,"Couldn't fault this hotel. Upgraded on arrival, everything was perfect. Rooms clean and spacious, comfortable bed. Bathroom bright and clean. Staff we're exceeding friendly and helpful. Will definitely stay there again.",5,2014,02,03
202,SPG Points Not Awarded Adequately for Wedding,"We had our wedding here at considerable expense. The hotel provided a very low  number of points considering the expenditure that was made - approx .66 points per $1 spent as opposed to normal 3 points per $1. The explanation offered is that the wedding was classified as an ""event"" and thus doesn't count towards SPG points, which makes no sense to me.",1,2014,02,03
202,"Lovely hotel, great location ","We visited Dublin as a birthday treat, the hotel is ideally located, However 5 stars does not merit this property a nice 4 star is the rating I would give.  Rooms clean, public toilets shelving was dusty, staff on reception and dinner were lovely and friendly, shame that can't be said for the atrium staff who looked down their nose at us and only became nicer once they realised that we were residents! ",3,2014,02,02
202,Afternoon tea,"Went for afternoon tea during day trip to Dublin. Luckily we had booked in advance as turned out to be quite busy. Chose this place based on afternoon tea menu, seemed more interesting and reasonable compared to other hotels. We definately made the correct decision

We arrived early so were encourage to try the Vault bar for a drink. lovely cocktails. Only let down was there was no table service and drinks were a wee bit slow, but I suppose thats only to be expected for traditional cocktails, and they did taste beauiful. 

Brought our cocktails to the Atrium where afternoon tea was served and we were wowed by the room. Really bright and beautiful. 

service was friendly and prompt. We opted for the ""peculiar"" afternoon teaand the food was amazing! it was interesting and tasty. not just style over substance. We still talk about our experience here and the exceptional value. Would be prepared to pay much more for what we got!",5,2014,01,30
202,"Brilliant staff, great location - just a few little renovations going on right now","I would stay here again - great comfy beds and perfect pillows (as in all Westin's). Our check in staff was brilliant, really helpful with suggestions for breakfast and maps and directions - exceeded my expectations. 

Some of the other reviews talk about street noise, there is a little bit, but I didn't find it excessive and you are right in the heart of things and across the road from Temple Bar so it's probably to be expected that you wont feel like you're in a quiet village.

There are a few little renovations going on inside and their ""Mint Bar"" was closed when we were there, but the inside of the hotel is really nice and there's nice little couches by many fireplaces in the common areas. And there is some upgrade going on in the street which meant the front looks a bit like a construction zone when you first arrive!

You can walk to almost anything. Cab to the airport is about 25-30 euro's and I noticed the airport bus stops just across the road.",4,2014,01,29
202,Great weekend in Dublin,"Spent 3 nights in Westin Dublin in January with my wife.  Westin Dublin is a great central location to Grafton St. shopping, Trinity College, Temple Bar, the river and both North and South Dublin.  The hotel is charming with attentive and friendly staff.  The rooms are very nice, tastefully updated furniture with classic marble baths.    Only two complaints -  we tried to have a pre dinner drink in the restaurant/bar.   I was told there was no bartender on duty at 7pm.  This seems rather rinky dink for a major hotel.   Also the hotels location to Temple Bar - both good and bad - provides the opportunity for late night noise from the street (think drunk people walking buy singing Irish songs  )  If you want quiet, would suggest a ""quiet room"".  On the other hand, its only a short walk from Temple Bar to your room!   Overall, a great experience.   There is also Starbucks next door for those seeking early morning coffee and a walk along the river.",4,2014,01,26
202,Our favorite place to stay in Dublin,"We usually come to Dublin to see family, but we always end up staying at least one night at the Westin. The hotel is beautiful, and unlike many other historical buildings that have been converted into hotels, the rooms are spacious and modern (at least the ones we have stayed in). The location is just phenomenal! We usually can see Trinity College from our window, Temple Bar is just a short walk away, and you are only about a block from Grafton Street.",5,2014,01,25
202,Good hotel in great loation,"Stayed at this hotel for one night last week. Right slap bang in the centre of Dublin this is a great spot to be. Arrived around noon and managed to get into my room straight away despite normal 3pm check in. Finding your room can be a bit of a challenge and my room was on the 2nd floor which had three or floor stairs to handle halfway around the hall. Once room found the room is modern, clean, decent size and had a nice bathroom. The wifi isn't free but 15 euro for high speed and 3 devices which isn't too bad. Bathroom old fashioned classic style but with modern taps/etc. The only real downside was that around half the tv channels didn't work or where out of signal service.

Would stay again if in Dublin!",4,2014,01,18
202,Luxury and comfort.,"Spent 3 nights here booked through Secret Escapes post New Year. What a wonderful surprise. A very welcoming reception area and very friendly staff. The room on the first floor overlooked an inner atrium dining area. This made it a very quiet room away from the traffic, but we did have remember to dress appropriately before through opening the curtains!! Most of the dinners gave a  smile and a wave :) The room was very comfortable and warm. the bed was fabulously comfortable. The bathroom was also up to the mark. 

Complaints : a minibar fridge which was sensor operated so it could be used to store anything personal e.g medication.

A ridiculously tariff for internet usage. We are used to travelling in Asia where it is offered everywhere for free.

Best for location and quality of the room.",5,2014,01,18
202,enjoyable stay,"Stayed here for one night on business. Was happy with the room and the service, which was friendly and efficient. There was free wifi included in the rate. Room was not enormous but was comfortable and the bathroom was nicely appointed.

I like the common areas in this hotel. The bar in the basement, the restaurant at ground floor and the atrium cafe on the mezzenine are all nice places to spend a bit of time. Breakfast was good - quality of cooked food was above the norm. Tea was pricey in the atrium cafe - EUR 4.50 for a cup of tea, come on! 

Recently stayed in the Westbury for business. Both are good hotels but I prefer the Westin. The common areas are nicer in my opinion and the Wesbury charge extra for cooked breakfast which is a joke given the room rate. Quality of rooms is similar though.",4,2014,01,17
202,Great hotel with excellent bar,"I really like this hotel. The rooms are nice and comfortable. The location is great and everything in Dublin is close by and within walking distance. I recommend the Mint Bar in the basement, especially on Fridays and Saturdays when they tend to have live music.

The only disappointing thing has been the breakfast; not really up to 5-star standard.",5,2014,01,15
202,Perfect Location & Stellar Service,"Westin Dublin was the perfect place to kick-off our 2-week family visit to Ireland. Location was perfect. Right in the city center, walking distance to Temple Bar area and Trinity College and a block away from an airport bus stop and a hop-on-hop-off tour pick up point. Service was fantastic, including acknowledgement and upgrades for SPG status - even us lowly Golds ;-). We arrived before our rooms were ready, but that was fine...as a light breakfast in the well-appointed Atrium Lounge was a good place to eat, relax and wait - chairs were super lush and - given our trans-Atlantic flight from Los Angeles - it was hard not to drift off to sleep.  Concierge rocked...got us a last minute seat at a hip farm to table restaurant nearby. Breakfast buffet in hotel's Exchange Restaurant was stellar - full Irish was of course available, but there were also plenty of standard American options - for those who thrive on pancakes and the like. Check out Mint Bar in the basement...dark woods, low lights, creative and tasty mixology...great spot for an afternoon drink before heading out to dinner.",5,2014,01,14
202,one night break away,"Having left our sons off at Dublin airport we had decided to treat ourselves to a short city break in Dublin before heading home.  i assume because it was a Saturday traffic was light and using the sat nav it was easy to find on Westmoreland street in the city centre.  The on duty door man took our car and parked it underground and we booked in.  We had arrived early not expecting to have a room to go to as book-in was not until 3pm, however our room was ready.  
Room was well appointed, clean, neat and just what you would expect from a 5* hotel with all the usual refinements including bathrobes, toiletries, tea, coffee and mini bar etc
Staff at all levels were attentive, courteous and helpful at all times
Breakfast was part of our booking and was wide ranging and plentiful with a choice of full Irish or Continental or both for that matter.
Very well located in the city centre close to the Temple Bar area, Gresham St and O'Connell St.
The only down side of the trip was the extra charges added to the bill.  Obviously you pay a premium price for a city centre 5* hotel however i would have thought that a hotel of this quality would have had free wifi in the rooms and not just in the lobby.  I had to pay 15 euros for 24hrs of wifi.  i also had to pay for the car parking another 25 euros for 24hrs.  
To finish on a positive note the break was enjoyable and the Westin is perfectly placed to explore the city.",5,2014,01,14
202,Location and Quality,"The hotel is very near Trinity College and the pedestrian shopping area that leads up to it.  Our room was spacious and comfortable.  Hotel staff was attentive and arranged for car rentals, dining suggestions, assisted with maps and so forth.  There is a small sitting area with a bar and light fare that is pleasant and well appointed.  It is a nice place for a small meeting, or a relaxing drink in the afternoon.",4,2014,01,11
202,Flawless stay,"This was my third stay at the Westin Dublin, this time 2 nights on a business trip. The location makes it the best choice for both business and pleasure, the facilities are very good, and the service flawless. I like the small but well equipped gym, as well as the lobby and common areas, stylish but not opulent. I had a junior suite, very spacious, well appointed, perfect to rest, to get work done and to relax. The marble bathroom was very big and comfortable.
The continental breakfast I had on both days was perfectly adequate. The choice of breads, pastry, cold cuts, cheese and fruit is plentiful - not extraordinary lavish but certainly more than adequate for any taste. There is even a machine to cook fresh pancakes! I found the (young) staff on duty both mornings extremely polite, professional and efficient, ready to accomodate any request.
In short, I had a perfect stay and needless to say I‚Äôll stay again if I‚Äôm back in Dublin.",5,2014,01,11
202,Something missing to make it a five star !!!,"We have spent 3 days in this very conveniently located westin Dublin at the end of our NYE trip to Ireland. 

The plus of this place is undoubtedly the location, close to train station, right in the city centre and every bus to the airport stop in front of the hotel. 

We had an upgrade from deluxe to Junior suite for a supplement. The room itself was nice and clean, decent size, nice sitting area and huge marble bathroom. Some part of the ceiling was a bit too low for tall people though. 

Like in every westin, we had of course nice king size ""heavenly bed"". I love it so much that I have pruchased the same to equiped my own bedroom so I know quite enough how to do the bed and for that I must say that the housekeeper have some lack of pratice because the bed was not reality well done at all. when you look closer the sheets were very messy and one side was short another was long, duvet not properly inserted in the cover it was quite disapointing for a 5 star westin... 

They were no proper turn down service but instead, the house keeping brouhgt water and a bucket of ice at 8.30pm which was quite out of subject. the bed was turn down and she even re-enter the room without knocking eventhough she knew we were inside !!     

The breakfast was not as good I would would expected it was a crowdy day around NYE and they were not that much variety of choices, plus some problem in refilling. Floors were quite dirty with food evreywhere as there were many children that day espacially around the couch area. They were nobody to sweep the floor before giving the table to new guests coming-in as I had been observing.

A five star hotel should be more careful of those small details... 

The common area was quite nice the lobby was small but cosy there were nothing to compare it with and nothing to complain about as well as for the atrium lounge which was quite like an extension of the lobby as you would prefer to sit in the lounge and in the lobby to have a chat or to be connected to wifi. I didn't have time to pay a visit to the fitness but it was a pity they don't have a swiming pool though

The personnel was friendly and professional eventhough some receptionnists looked a bit stressed I I presume the hotel was fully booked with a wedding going on the 31/12/13...  

The check-out was quite efficient and everything went quick. 

As conclusion I quite like staying at The Westin and I think it's of the best choice for staying in Dublin. But according to my experience I would down grade this hotel to a 4 star / 4+ star as some detail of the service was not there yet to make it properly a 5 star hotel.",4,2014,01,07
202,5 sweet days- beautiful and quiet,"My 3 kids and I spent 5 days in Dublin sight seeing and eating. The Westin was beyond perfect. Our rooms were huge, thanks to the Amex upgrade, and so comfortable. The rooms connected so we felt like we had a suite. It is a perfect way to travel with older kids because everyone has privacy but we are all very near. We ate breakfast every morning in the restaurant. (part of a breakfast included deal) and the choices were great and food delicious. We staff was angelic and made every effort to be helpful. The concierge was always at the ready with great ideas for adventure. The location was perfect. I worked out every morning and the gym was clean and Equiptment fine. In the afternoons while we had a rest hour, I would sit by one of the fireplaces and read. We were all very comfortable at a very competitive price. Westin had me at hello.",5,2014,01,05
202,Irish Delight,"Grand accommodations, ambience and service...from Front Desk to Conceirge to wait staff. Location the best for walking all around Dublin, from Trinity College, Temple Bar, parks, carless blocks for window shopping with fun entertainment at the curbside. Also close to busline should you care to venture further.",5,2014,01,04
202,Great location and excelent service,"I stayed over at the Westin Dublin for Christmas, and the experience was second to none. The location is amazing, just besides Trinity College and in front of Temple Bar. Personnel at the reception and the concierge were super friendly and always happy to help. Breakfast was very good, but in case you'd like to have something light you may want to go to the Starbucks that's practically besides the hotel. Another plus is the high quality of the rooms. My bed was very comfortable and even when the hotel is in such a centric location, the rooms aren't noisy. I know a lot of hotels in Dublin, and definitively the Westin is one of my favourites.

In summary, if you're looking for a luxury accommodation with a great bar in one of the best spots in Dublin, look no more and book here.",5,2014,01,03
202,Christmas lunch,"A belated thank you for the wonderful Christmas lunch myself and my family had on Monday the 23rd of December. We really enjoy the ambiance and the food. The service was fantastic, we all commented on how nice the day was. 
 It was a great way to kick off Christmas and a lovely welcome home for my son from who  had travelled from Australia.",5,2014,01,03
202,"Ultimate location, great property","If location is important, no other hotel in Dublin is as central as the Westin.
Across the road from Temple Bar, the strip with the best Irish pubs in Dublin and a short stroll to both shopping strips, the hotel is extremely well located.
Service is possibly their only letdown. We had 3 rooms, one of which wasn't serviced until 6pm at night and the concierge was nowhere to be seen over the 3 days, leaving us to our own vices to book restaurants etc.
Not normal for Westin Hotels, and whilst no excuse, I'll give them the benefit of the xmas period and a wedding at the hotel during our stay as an excuse.
Rooms are well appointed and their ""heavenly beds"" are always a treat.
Don't bother with the view as there simply isn't one. Our deluxe room looked straight into the side of a roof, about 2 feet away.
Food at the Mint Bar was fantastic and they even kept the kitchen open for us after a late arrival.
Would highly recommend this hotel, if only they could sort out their concierge.",4,2014,01,01
202,Festive and Fun Westin Dublin,"The Westin Dublin in December was an Irish ""Merry Christmas"" fantasyland. It is the perfect tourism location that was so convenient when we just wanted to stroll through the neighborhood as essentially all of the sights and attractions are nearby. As we entered we were welcomed by a pair of roaring fireplaces (with seating areas nearby), tons of decorations, and a choice of warm cider or a mulled fruit drink, and I hadn't even checked in yet! Check in was smooth and fast as Nicole Thomas and Kristina Moody in reservations had assisted in advance. Great job. My room was delightful, clean, and comfortable with a large bathroom. Room service (Irish coffees and appetizers) was delicious and fast. The management here (Fred Smits especially) runs a lovely establishment that should be at the top of your list in Dublin. I dined at the other older famous hotel and I must say that it is no match for this team. The Westin Dublin is the go to spot.",5,2013,12,31
202,Great location,The hotel has a great location . The front desk and manager were top notch . Concierge services were not up to par for a Westin . The recommendations were weak and did not help us at all . The breakast was superb . The room was poorly lit and outlets were not easy to use . We had a bite to eat in the atrium but it was disappointing that it was booked with weddings for two out of te three days .,3,2013,12,30
202,Christmas Eve,We have had our Christmas Eve lunch in Westin for last five or six years.Always a nice experience for the six of us---Champagne in Atrium then buffet lunch! This year was a disaster from the start--rang four or five times in November to book---Christmas Co-ordinater was never there and never returned call eventually got call back --this becauseI I got quite annoyed with phone operater Booked table for Six---got call from Co-ordinater about 10 th December looking for credit card details and informing us meal had gone up to ‚Ç¨85 per head---think it was ‚Ç¨65 last year----queried what we were getting for increase---guy didn't know---said he was new this year. Met up in Atrium had our usual great experience---nice table--lovely staff--a couple of bottles of Champagne. Glad we enjoyed it because it was downhill all the way after that ! Went down to Banking Hall---half full --no athmosphere at all -Food was very good---but had a rotten table---Band very good but packed up early--staff couldn't wait for us to finish to get off home for Christmas--understandable--but not good enough---a bored looking young Santa going around---we were so glad we had no kids with us---. It was probably very good for our livers as we only had two bottles of wine between Six of us--we all couldn't wait to get out---   Nobody came around to ask were we enjoying the meal and I can understand why! We certainly won't repeat the experience!,2,2013,12,28
202,Best location in the center,"The hotel is located in an ideal spot, right in the heart of the city.
Staff are very friendly and always willing to help. 
Food in the restaurant is excellent, and the happy hour is great value.
Breakfast is awesome, with a wide selection of top quality foods.
The cocktail bar is also worth a visit.
Some rooms can be noisy, but overall, they're fine.",4,2013,12,26
202,"Wonderful, central Dublin hotel","I absolutely loved my stay at the Dublin Westin. The central location was perfect for exploring the city on foot. A very short walk to Temple Bar pubs and to Grafton Street shopping. The staff were so friendly and helpful, really enhancing my stay. And, the room was just perfect. Comfortable Westin bed. Lovely soaking tub. Beautiful marble in the bathroom. Quiet room. Good food (and more good staff) at the Atrium lounge.  When I return to Dublin, I know where I will be staying.",5,2013,12,22
202,Excellent service recovery,"We stayed one night in Westin Dublin as it's closer to the Main Street for museums and temple Bars, and of course it's much easy for us to meet up with friends for the night. 
The check-in was not a good experience, but service recovery by Fred was simply fantastic. We were upgraded to the suite of the hotel. This is something we were not expecting, but a very nice gesture by the GM.
Breakfast and tea were good, especially the service staff from the Atrium. She is very attentive and warm. 
Thank you Westin Dublin for a wonderful night.",4,2013,12,20
202,Best location in town,"I was hesitant to book when i read a few snarky reviews here. So glad i did, though. This was a lovely hotel. Our room was excellent. The marble bathroom was totally luxurious. Beautiful linens and bath products. The downstairs bar/restaurant was above average. No complaints at all.",5,2013,12,17
202,A bit dull & lifeless!,"Elegant reception which handled check in smooth and efficiently. We were allocated one of the SPG floor rooms, for the group members, this had been totally refitted and had the great smell of new carpet and fittings. For a 5* hotel the room lacks warmth upon arrival! no heating! It lacks easy facilities of a Nespresso machine and biscuits. 

Food in The Mint Bar is excellent. Service is prompt and friendly with a good selection of dishes until 10pm.

Breakfast needs attention. The guy on duty needs firing, staff are dull and lifeless. Only 1 person was in the restaurant when we walked in at 0830 and yet there was no bacon, orange juice or butter at the buffet. Crossain't are dried out. Dirty plates are left on your small table, uncleared. Table service was slow and unattentive.",3,2013,12,17
202,"Just wonderful, everything you would expect from a Westin.","We found an opportunity to spend two nights in Dublin on our way home from Spain. As a member of the Starwoods Preferred Guest Program I found an excellent opportunity using points and was able to upgrade to an even nicer room for 29 Euro per night. The staff at every level were superb. We enjoyed supper one evening at the Mint Restaurant onsite and the food was so good that we made of point of letting the front desk know at check out.  The location is perfect  and close to Trinity College, St. Patricks Cathedral, Christ Church and yes, the Guiness Brewery. Our room (4th floor) had been recently renovated so everything was in excellent working order. We hope to return to Dublin in the near future for a week and the Westin Dublin will definitely be part of our itinerary.",5,2013,12,16
202,Stylish five star hotel in the centre of Dublin,"The Westin Dublin keeps up the standard of Westin hotels generally. All of the usual standard features, such as the heavenly bed are in place. The service levels are really first class, from the doorman all the way through to the reception. We booked a Junior Suite and were upgraded to an Executive Suite. It was really nice, with a separate elevated lounge room and huge bathroom, with shower and bath. The hotel is quite a happening place, with a real vibe around the lobby. There is a really nice bar downstairs. We arrived on a Friday night and the place was jumping. The location of the hotel is fantastic. Temple Street is right across the road, and this the equivalent of Bourbon Street in New Orleans, Lan Kwai Fong in Hong Kong. Loads of bars and restaurants with a traditional Irish feel, with live music everywhere. The shopping areas and attractions are similarly within short walking distance. There is a fitness centre, well equipped and open 24 hours.",5,2013,12,14
202,Birthday Weekend in Dublin,"My girlfriend and I spent two glorious nights at the Westin from 7th December to celebrate my 26th birthday weekend. I booked through a ‚Äòsecret hotel‚Äô deal through lastminute.com which worked out at ¬£70pp per night (excellent value for a weekend stay at this place).

The hotel is in a terrific location just a stone‚Äôs throw from Trinity College for culture, Grafton Street for shopping, Temple Bar for partying, and the airport shuttle bus service for the sad voyage home‚Ä¶

The staff were friendly and the room was very nice, with a great bathroom and most comfortable bed. There was also sky sports on TV which helped to ease the frustration of waiting around for my one true love to do her hair etc.

This 5* Victorian hotel is one I would recommend highly to anyone wanting to spend an enjoyable and comfortable time in the wonderful city of Dublin.",5,2013,12,11
202,The most comfortable beds ever!,"Not only is the location of this hotel great. The lobby, the rooms, the bar, and overall luxury of this hotel is outstanding. The beds in the room were something to die for. (I know not proper grammar but really) The Westin cloud or whatever it is cold is beyond comfortable I could have stayed in bed forever. I like European hotels that have been upgraded. This hotel will not disappoint.",4,2013,12,09
202,In Center City,"Centrally located in downtown. Walking distance to all attractions. Service is very good with a nice selections of restaurants in house to meet your needs. Parking is a problem if you have a car but you don't need one. Rooms are very nice, clean and staff is extremely helpful.",4,2013,12,08
202,Great Experience,"I strongly recommend this hotel.   The staff was so very pleasant and professional.   The room was exceptionally clean.   And, the location of this hotel is so very convenient to the shops and eateries.   I will definitely stay at the Westin in Dublin again.

202,"Next to Trinity College and Near Grafton Street, Temple Bar areas","I chose this hotel because my daughter wanted to visit the ""Harry Potter"" library at Trinity College and to also see the college grounds.  It was also recommended as a place where you could just walk out your door and be near everything, which it was!  We loved the location and were able to see Grafton Street, cross the river, shop, and find plenty of restaurants and pubs everywhere we looked.  Bringing daughters, ages 20 and 21, meant going to the Temple Bar area at night and it was a short walk away.  

The rooms we had were luxurious.  Our daughters had two twin beds and their bathroom was humungous!  I have never seen such a huge bathroom in a center city hotel, anywhere!  We had a King room with a bathroom half the size, but it was still normal-sized and gorgeous so I did not 
mind at all.  The beds were very comfortable and had quality linens.  

From the moment we arrived, I felt the staff was eager to take care of us.  We arrived very early, way before check-in, after doing an all-night flight from America.  I really didn't believe they'd have a room ready for us, but they did so we put all our luggage in the one room and went out to sight see.  The staff was very eager to get another room for us as soon as possible and near one another.  

The breakfast buffet was in an elegant room and included hot foods such as an Irish Breakfast, along with another buffet with smoked salmon, cereals, fruit and yogurt. I do not eat any wheat or grains and was able to find plenty of delicious food.  Breakfast was included in our room price so we just had to tell them our room number when we came down to eat.  

We also stayed here one night at the end of our trip before an early flight to America.  This time, my husband and I had a room on the Trinity College side of the hotel.  This can get a bit noisy on a Saturday night when everyone comes home from the pubs.  I am a light sleeper, though, and my husband did not hear a thing.

Please be careful when going out to The Temple Bar area though.  My daughter had her brand new iPhone stolen right out of her pocket that was buttoned.  There are professional pick-pockets looking for easy prey in crowded situations and they can have your phone right out of your pocket before you know it. This has nothing to do with the hotel, but I felt you should be prepared when you go out at night so the same thing doesn't happen to you or your kids.",5,2013,12,06
202,Very nice place to stay in Dublin,"I was really impressed with this hotel, everyone was nice from check-in to check-out.  The location could not be beat, when you leave the hotel and walk to the right, within steps you have two Starbucks (across the street from each other), plus great eateries around too.  I love that Trinity College was so close.  I plan on staying here again.",4,2013,12,04
202,Loved It.,"I am surprised this isn't ranked higher. We really enjoyed our stay here. Cleanest/newest hotel rooms we encountered in Ireland and wonderful location. 

The hotel bar could be nicer (turns almost club like at night) but the hotel rooms were fantastic. It is also centrally located and a short walk to everything!! 

I would highly consider this if traveling to Dublin!",4,2013,12,02
202,Great location and very nice!,"It's near trinity college and temple bar area. While temple bar area may be touristy, it's fun to walk through... Plus the hotel is really in the center of things (grafton st, etc) the rooms were clean and there's a nice bar downstairs called mint. Also a block away is a bar called Bank... It's a bank they converted into a bar... MUST GO!",5,2013,12,01
202,Good hotel in Central Dublin,"I've stayed here twice this year. The staff are lovely. The building has lots of character and the rooms are pretty decent. It is a classic hotel, rather than cutting edge, but both stays have been great. The internal rooms, facing into an internal courtyard, rather than out onto the street, are a little odd but ultimately I would stay again. Good breakfast and room service, attentive staff, worth a look.",4,2013,11,29
202,could not or would not fix lighting in room,"we had to turn off the master switch in the room to make the entry light turn off. then, of course the clock didn't work and neither would the bathroom light. We called the desk and they sent someone up to see.  He couldn't fix it. He left. He came back with the night manager, who thought the repair man and us that we were idiots. Then he couldn't fix it.  The next morning I told the desk about it and to please fix it. They didn't. I told the desk again the next morning to please fix it. They didn't. We checked out the next day, I complained and they took a little off the room bill. But it really didn't compensate for the problem.  The earlier times I stayed there everything was fine but this time horrible. I wont stay there again.",3,2013,11,25
202,Family friendly,"We had a lovely stay at the Westin, in our suite there were games to keep the kids occupied as well as a choice of film. When we came back from our dinner there were cookies with their names on them and chocolate milk, the kids were thrilled. Although we were in middle of the city it was lovely and quiet. Have stayed before twice and both stays were equally as good.",4,2013,11,25
202,What a nice classy hotel,"Stayed at this hotel earlier this week, meeting American colleagues who are Starwood points obsessed. So did not hold much hope. However this is in a great location just off Temple bar, away from the noise, so on the south side. I had an executive room on the top floor which had recently been renovated. Very well decorated, huge bathroom with free standing rain shower and a great little terrace overlooking the street below. This would be a real bonus in the summer, a very romantic little spot to watch Dubliners pass by below. Best of all was the bed. Oh so nice and comfy. Go try. Will visit again when in Dublin on business next year.",4,2013,11,21
202,Geat service by excellent staff,Had a great one night stay here. Very central location opposite Trinity College. Was assigned a king-size room which was very spacious and very well fitted out. Found the staff very welcoming and professional. Will definitely return again for another visit.,5,2013,11,20
202,"Convenient location, good service","The Westin is a global chain so there is a bit of sameness to each property. The service and rooms were just fine, nothing really outstanding or negative. Staff was pleasant. The hotel is laid out a bit oddly, from a physical perspective. But it was all fine, nothing too memorable (either positive or negative). Personally I prefer a hotel with a bit more character and uniqueness but Westin is pretty dependable and consistent.",4,2013,11,19
202,Room For Improvement,"Niggly little things. The lighting in our room was bizarrely configured, one of the ceiling speakers did not work, we reported this but it was not fixed as promised. We asked for a small table for the balcony, again this was accepted without question as a request but never happened. We couldn't pay in the Atrium as there was no waiter present so went to the desk in reception and one of the staff was, we thought, rather curt for a 5 star. Overall our stay was very good but these are four star not five star behaviours. Room was spacious with aforesaid balcony giving a wonderful view across to the Wicklow Mountains. Bed was awesomely comfortable but for the price paid these were inadequate compensations.",3,2013,11,18
202,Excellent experience,"I had a fantastic experience here.  The hotel is beautiful and the location is ideal.  I walked all over Dublin and felt this was centrally located to everything I wanted to see.  Trinity College is across the street, Grafton Street shopping area is 5 minute walk, Temple Bar area is also right next door.  The hotel room was superb, clean, roomy, and well appointed.  I thought the hotel was charming but also modern and up to date.  The bar downstairs was warm and inviting, I had a nice afternoon lunch to get out of the cold.  The staff were exceptionally helpful.  They really went out of their way to help me store bags there when I arrived (before the day I checked in) during a brief layover before heading to meeting in Belfast; the bell captain kept my stuff so I could tour around Dublin for a few hours before taking the train.  I then returned a few days later and found the service equally friendly and helpful.  I would DEFINITELY stay here agin if I return to Dublin.",5,2013,11,17
202,Great Hotel in A fun city,"This was a five day rocket-fast holiday from California to Dublin, so it was a whirl-wind to say the least. I chose the Westin over other 4-5 star hotels in Dublin because of stellar reviews on Trip Advisor and its physical location right in the middle of center city.
Our long flight landed in Dublin at 6AM, so I dreaded the time gap until we could check into the hotel, thinking it would be 3PM as it usually is. We walked into the lobby at 8:30 AM and told that our room would be ready after we had breakfast. Unbelievably, the clerk called before we even ordered coffee to advise that our room was ready. That is wonderful service. 
Everything about the Westin was superb. We usually stay in Marriotts, so we are spoiled by consistent high quality and were not disappointed here. Along with the staff being incredibly helpful and friendly, the hotel was beautiful and immaculate. Our room was lovely by any standard; the bedding was sumptuous and the very modern bathroom (with both a large shower and a separate bath tub) was huge by American standards, let alone the typical European small bathroom. The room included one US style electrical outlet and USB jacks built into the desk area.
The location was perfect. Most things we wanted to see were less than 10 minutes away from the Westin. We bought a bus pass for 28 euros and it took us everywhere else, including the seasde sights and to & from the airport.
In fairness, this rating should be 4.75 instead of a 5, because wi-fi was not included even in common areas. 

A minor disappointment was no coffee available in the morning in the lobby as Marriott provides. However, there is a Starbucks right next door which opens early.

This was our second stay at a Starwood Hotel this year (Zihuatenao Mexico earlier) and both were so splendid that I have become a member and feel perfectly comfortable staying there any time.",5,2013,11,15
202,dublin,"Westin Dublin 
 has a perfect location , across from Temple Bar and next to Trinity College. They also have a perfect staff, the most helpful overall hotel I have ever stayed at. The rooms are nice and comfortable and the bathroom lovely. We ate at the Mint Bar one night (were to tired to go back to Temple Bar) food was good bar service timely and again staff was so friendly. We can't wait to return to Ireland.",5,2013,11,15
202,Great location - disappointing experience,"I stayed at the Westin Dublin for 2 nights this past weekend, my first experience at this hotel.  The location is excellent - right in the heart of Dublin, opposite Trinity College and walking distance from everything the city has to offer.  The physical property itself is beautiful, once you get inside.  Over the years, I've stayed at dozens of Westin properties worldwide, but this one is by far the most attractive.  It exudes an air of elegance and history that are almost always missing from the Westin chain.  The staff were friendly and accommodating and - surprisingly - mostly Irish.  That seems to be a rarity in Ireland these days, with the influx of immigrants taking many open positions in the hospitality industry.

With all of that said, I was disappointed with this stay.  I had booked through the American Express Fine Hotels & Resorts program.  This stay was supposed to come with complimentary afternoon tea for two, daily breakfast and a room upgrade, amongst other benefits.  

Afternoon tea was only available at 5pm which, is to my mind, not afternoon tea, but closer to dinner.  Really, if you have tea at that time, what time do you expect to have dinner?  It's a bit absurd.  If the amenity is not reasonably available, they should offer an alternative.  I skipped the 5pm tea.

On the first night, I left out the door hanger order form for breakfast to be delivered at 10am.  It never appeared.  I didn't pursue the matter, as I just didn't have the time (decided to just avail of the lie-in instead).  On day two, breakfast did materialize, which was good as I had an early start for my trek back to Texas.  It was hot, fresh and tasty.  I just don't understand why it didn't appear on my first morning there.

As for the room upgrade, I wasn't offered one.  I had a deluxe queen room, exactly what I booked.  That's fine, I understand that upgrades are on as 'as available' basis.  With that said, this is the first property I've booked with the AmEx Fine Hotels program that didn't come through with an upgrade.  I paid a premium to book using this program and didn't feel like I got value for that premium.  AmEx offers an avenue for feedback on each Fine Hotels stay, and I'll be availing of that opportunity, too.

Despite the great location and the nice property, I will go back to the Conrad or the Ritz-Carlton (or whatever that property has been rebranded to) before I return to the Westin.",3,2013,11,14
202,Perfect place to explore Dublin from,"The Westin is located right in the center of Dublin which puts it within walking distance of all the sights (everything within 2.5 mile radius, if that is too far there is always the hop-on hop-off bus or regular city buses).  The hotel itself is in an old bank building that is filled with fine architectural detail - ask a staffer to show you the ballroom which use to be the main teller space in the bank - it is as opulent as any palace.  The staff are very helpful and friendly, we sked to see the ballroom and were treated to an impromptu tour of all the great spaces from the old bank - every staffer gave the same great level of effort, we always got more than we asked for (in a good way).  The hotel breakfast  buffet is quite good with a large selection and they had no trouble accomodating a gluten-free diet, including specially making gluten-free porridge.  The rooms were large and comfortable, the windows open  - the only drawback is that the street-side rooms can be a bit noisy.",5,2013,11,14
202,"""Extremely Central Location i.e. Heart of the City. Service , Attitude and  Location - it is perfect!‚Äù","Really enjoyed my stay at Westin. Great location and some great restaurants. Very friendly staff. Relaxing and enjoyable stay. Would definitely stay here again, on my next trip to Dublin. The Westin is an excellent choice to stay and the restaurant in the hotel serves excellent food and wine (Exchange Bar, The Mint Bar and The Atrium Lounge!!!)",5,2013,11,14
202,Couldn't Ask for a Better Place to Stay,"My husband and I just spent 3 nights in Dublin at the Westin. We were so impressed with everything about the hotel. From the staff that couldn't do enough for us, to our room which was truly lovely, great bed, great shower, and even the hotel restuarant was far better than the usual for a hotel. The location of the hotel was absolutely perfect, we could walk everyone. Great, great choice, we highly recommend it.",5,2013,11,13
202,Stunning Hotel and Amazing Service,"Just returned from a weekend trip to Dublin and chose this hotel on the strength of some excellent reviews on this site. From the moment you walk through revolving door you instantly realise that this is a fanstastic hotel. From the decor to the attentive staff, this place oozes class without being pretentious.

As a surprise trip to celebrate our 10th Wedding Anniversary i had requested a 'college view' room if possible. When we arrived (slightly early) for check-in we were informed that we had been upgraded to a suite! This probably had something to do with it not being a particularly busy time of the year but nontheless we were both very pleased, obviously. The room wasn't quite ready but a wander around the Trinity College grounds whiled away 45 mins until we got the call to say it was ready.

They also sent up a desert with 'Happy 10th Anniversary' written on the plate in the evening. A small thing you might say, but its those small things that just add to the overall experience.

A special mention to Phillip on the Conceierge Desk who recommended a great restaurant for us on Saturday evening. 

Full Irish Breakfast (included in the price) on Sunday morning was just what we needed and i would therefore definately recommend staying at this hotel. Worth every penny!

202,Luxury and super-attentive service!,"We splurged in Dublin and it was worth every penny!  On our first day in Ireland, the Westin accommodated us with an early check-in.

Wi-fi in the lobby, business center, pub.  Close to Grafton Street, Trinity College and Connely railroad station.  A really nice place in the heart of Dublin.
Atrium Lounge has bright and lovely d√©cor; great service!
We ate twice at the Atrium during our stay at the Westin because we got some special service and very nice, light meals.  It is a quiet, beautiful place to enjoy a meal.  We had a crab sandwich, butternut squash soup, chilli chicken, which were all wonderful.",5,2013,11,05

202,Good hotel in a convenient location,"Having stayed in numerous 4* hotels in Dublin it was a real treat to check into the Westin. The room prices are a little higher than can be found in similar 4* hotels nearby, but the service and great night's sleep in their heavenly bed is worth it. Only downside was the fairly limited menu choice in the hotel bar for dinner. That being said, the staff there were fantastic and made me feel very welcome and 'at home' when dining by myself. Would recommend.",4,2013,11,05
202,Lush,"Stayed overnight, luckily on a business trip.

While our room was not ready the management provided us with a nice and quite room for a while, we were able to rest for a while until some friends joined us for a day of touring.

The hotel is directly next to Grafton street, which is the primary shopping area to visit, Trinity College and many of the restaurants you will want to visit. The staff was courteous and accommodating. The only complaint I have is that they were the only hotel, of the five I stayed at in Ireland, to charge for internet. And when you're coming from America, 12 Euros per day can add up.",4,2013,10,25

There is a lounge on the mezzanine level and one in the lobby. A bar in the basement has tap beer and live music.

I would definitely stay here again.",5,2013,10,21
202,Good stay except for incident with reception,"My husband and and I stayed at the Westin for 6 nights during a recent October 2013 trip to Ireland. So many nice things about the hotel, but also some that are not so nice. We reserved the least expensive room, which was still quite expensive. The room was very clean but a bit small. The room was stocked with the usual Westin bath products, as well as a complementary bottle of water. The location was great and we particularly enjoyed our dinners in The Mint Bar. Breakfast is good too but overpriced. For the price it would have been nice to have free wifi in the room (versus having to go to the lobby or atrium for it) and a fridge. One great perk of staying at the Westin is their green choice. It was nice to get a 5 euro voucher when we opted not to get our room cleaned. Housekeeping checked in with us when we opted for green choice to make sure we didn't need any toiletries or towels. The gym is on the first floor, which one can access with a room key. It's stocked with great machines and there's even a bathroom in there. 

Many friendly staff members helped us, including Jelena, Linda, Stefan and Peter the doorman. However, that wasn't the case with one young man we think is named Neil (another reviewer mentioned a guy with a smirk--this is most likely him). One late night my husband was sick and asleep in the room. I decided to go to the atrium to use my iPad (no free room wifi). Upon returning upstairs, my room key didn't work. I went to reception and explained the situation to Neil. His tone was quite rude and said he can only help me if I show photo id. I was in my pjs, husband is sickly and asleep, I don't have my id on me obviously. After repeating several times that I don't have my id and no way to get it without access to the room, he called a security guard to escort me upstairs. I gave Neil the key that didn't work and he wouldn't even let me touch it after he reprogrammed it. I completely understand the need for security but his tone made me feel like a criminal. I doubt a criminal would be in her pjs and if I weren't staying in the hotel I wouldn't have had the bad key in the first place. It would have been different if I didn't have a key. All the commotion woke my poor sickly husband up. So beware of Neil and/or if your key doesn't work. Carry id at all times, even in your pjs. Management called a day later to make sure I was ok and they said they would speak to the receptionist about his tone. I appreciated that.",4,2013,10,19

202,Average Hotel,"Maybe if we had not been impressed by The Shelbourne Hotel where we stayed one night before checking into this Westin Hotel, then perhaps we would have been okay with it.  I really tried to like this Westin.  But I could not help make comparisons with The Shelbourne.  Here are some of the reasons why you should stay at The Shelbourne instead of Westin:
1.  The Shelbourne is steep in Irish history.  There is a little museum inside the hotel about its history and famous guests.
2.  Westin charges for wifi access.  The Shelbourne doesn't.
3.  Our one-bedroom suite in Westin looked was boring.  Very business like; zero charm at all.  The Shelbourne's was beautifully appointed and was named the JFK suite, a nod to a famous Irish-American, our former president.  
4.  Westin charges extra for breakfast.  The Shelbourne's one-bedroom suite included free breakfast.  Our suite at The Shelbourne had fresh flowers and a live plant.  I know it's silly mentioning that here but those little things make quite an impression for travelers like me.  It means the hotel is really trying to make me feel at home.
5.  The cost of a one bedroom suite is comparable for both hotels, so why settle for a crummy suite?",3,2013,10,16
202,"Superb location, decent facility, lousy service and horrible attitude","Me and my wife stayed here for 6 nights. I am a lifetime platinum member and generally get treated very well (smiling front desk staff thanks me for loyalty upon arrival, automatic upgrade to a suite without asking, handwritten welcome letter from staff waiting in the room , chocolates / welcome snacks placed in my room before arrival etc...). Well, it was none of that here but on top of that,  the treatment I got at this hotel was nothing short of ""insulting"".

So, here it goes ---

I arrived at the hotel at 1 PM. I had previously requested an early check-in as I was initially scheduled to reach by 10 AM. After a long line and very slow / inefficient moving of guests in the line I was told that I can have an ordinary room immediately or must wait 3 hours for a better room... I argued and challenged the front desk to come up with a more reasonable alternative, such as they could check me into an ordinary room and tell me when a better room is ready so that I can move, and to that I was told that they can't do it because they will then need to clean my first room --- ??? REALLY !!! I couldn't believe the arrogance and stubbornness of this guy at the front desk with a smirk on his face and ""I don't care about you"" attitude ... I demanded manager's attention and then I was told to wait in an empty conference room for 2 hours by the time my room got ready (probably so that they won't have to deal with me for some time!). The assigned room was good / satisfactory but nothing extra ordinary worth the long painful wait!

I was paying top rate for my stay and generally breakfast is included in my corporate rate and/or as platinum member benefit. I was given a choice of 500 points/day or breakfast vouchers. I chose the points and paid big bucks for breakfast every day. When I checked out, I reminded them that I expected these points to show up in my account. Today, a month after my stay and already calling Platinum support line twice to inform, these guys are still mulling over what exactly it is that they need to do.

Yes, the location is fabulous - right next to the Trinity College, close to Temple bar. Walk-ability is superb and it is a great location for exploring the city. Hotel facilities are decent but the staff / service gets an ""F"" from me.",3,2013,10,14
202,Great location,"The location is definitely the biggest plus. The room are nice, properly furnished (even if it is odd to have TV speakers also in the bathroom) and warm. The level of the staff was very inconsistent. Most of them were marvelous but some other were almost unbearable. The biggest down was the 15 Euro per day internet connection, clearly unacceptable in a 4 stars hotel.",4,2013,10,14
202,Good location is the main reason to stay here,"Just around the corner from Trinity College and literally across the street from the AirTrain coach, which transports you to/from the airport for 7 euros.  You can walk to the Temple Bar area, yet are away from the crowds.  
As far as the hotel itself, maybe I'm spoiled by the Westin resorts, but it just seemed like a regular
 (expensive) European hotel.  If I based my review only on the first few nights we stayed there, and forgot about the last night (a 2nd check-in 3 days later), I would have a more positive feeling.
The concierge staff, doormen, restaurant staff were all very nice, but the reception desk left me fuming.
The room was very comfortable and the bathroom quite nice.",4,2013,10,12
202,"Good location, unfriendly front desk, a mixed bag for a high price","My sister and I have stayed in many many Westins in countries all around the world and they have always been our brand of choice but this experience soured us on them. The good points are the location is close to the Liffey, Grafton Street and The Book of Kells and the concierge guys are super nice and helpful as are the doormen. 

The bad news is that the front desk staff were cold and condescending when we discussed a rate issue that arose because someone at SPG's reservation center had failed to send my sister an email confirming our rate. They could have easily seen that we both have their AMEX cards, have used them extensively for many years and believed her very detailed and accurate explanation. But they stuck with the party line and spoke to us as if we were children about how hotel pricing fluctuates - trust me, we know and get it! And they charged us about 100 euros over what she was told would be the charge.

Then we were put in a room right over a loud wedding reception (don't stay on the 1st floor). The noise did end at 11:40 which they said it would but when you're dead tired that can feel very late. Also we had stayed there 4 nights at the beginning of our trip and were now back for a last night before leaving the country and when we said ""Hi, we remember you"" to the woman at the front desk she said ""Unfortunately, I can't say the same"" with a blank face. Jeezh - this didn't feel like Ireland! They need at least one Irish person at the check-in desk so you can remember what country you're in - one where the people are nice!

Also there wasn't good lighting in the room, the hair dryer couldn't be used in the bathroom and it would have been nice if when they offered to call us a cab they told us there's a 5 euro surcharge for calling one to a hotel and you can walk to a very nearby cab stand and avoid that charge.

They also have a very high fee for wi-fi. They refunded it to us as we were in town for a travel bloggers' conference but they also gave us a little speech, again as if we were idiots, that this ""wouldn't guarantee that it would always be free"". We don't react well to being talked down to!

It's too bad that one lousy experience can turn you on a brand but I have to say that this one did. But once again - remember that the doormen and concierge guys are nice as are the bar tenders and wait staff downstairs in The Mint Bar.

Can't resist one more thing - the single beds don't seem to be ""Heavenly Beds"" and every night I slept there I woke up with an aching hip and that didn't happen at any other hotels.",3,2013,10,11
202,Beautiful,We were there for 4 nights and it was our favorite out of all the hotels we stayed in over 2 weeks. It was an old bank building that is In the heart of Dublin's places to see.  Bathroom was fabulous-spacious AND beautiful.  Great bar downstairs with excellent food and hotel restaurant was beautiful also. Definitely a repeat visit is needed.,5,2013,10,09
202,Brilliant Hotel,"Amazing hotel,

Well worth the five stars. 

The staff treat their guests incredibly well, the beds are the comfiest beds for hotel standards and the location is perfect. 

There is free wifi in the lobby too.",5,2013,10,09
202,Fantastic Hotel!,"This review is based on the Samuel Beckett Suite, one of the hotel‚Äôs Library Suites.   GREAT room!   Two stories..... small balcony... nice large bathroom... comfortable bed.   Wonderful.... I did not want to leave.  The staff was friendly and helpful.   The breakfast buffet is well worth taking as an option over the 500 bonus points for Platinum guests.  The food was very good!  The location is perfect for anyone looking to enjoy all Dublin has to offer.   If I am back in Dublin, I will stay here again.",5,2013,10,08
202,Lovely hotel,"Spent 3 nights in the Westin for a weekend away with my partner.  Having stayed in many hotels in Dublin this is definitely my favourite. The rooms are spacious with plush decor. Plenty of mirrors and well lit for us ladies getting ready for a night out! Staff were pleasant and helpful and came to our rescue with toothpaste after my other half was given the responsibility of packing it! Brilliant location. Close to all the shops, bars and restaurants and buses and taxis are available outside the door if you want to go further afield. The mint bar downstairs is very elegant warm and welcoming, again with lovely friendly staff. Can't wait to go back!",5,2013,10,08
202,good way to use Starwood points,"This Westin is lovely and centrally located in Dublin (note that it's easy to get to the Hop-On-Hop-Off bus stop).  Unlike in the U.S., the two-bed rooms have two single beds instead of two doubles.  Beds here are soft--traditional Westin heavenly bed.

Specifically for SPG members, I'd recommend this hotel.  The cost for each night using points is within acceptable range; it's relatively easy to get upgraded here; the breakfast was excellent; and the service was as good as one would expect from a European Westin (I'd argue a small step above the U.S. service).  On the con side, the standard rooms were pretty small.  Main pro is the location.",5,2013,10,08
202,Excellent - Fantastic hotel & service,"Brilliant!  Our room was fantastic, very spacious and had everything that we needed!  Upon arrival, there was a bottle of wine, cheese, crackers and some grapes next to a hand written card from the hotel welcoming us and wishing us a pleasant stay.  It's these little touches that can really make a big difference.  The marble bathroom was gorgeous, and the room had a really relaxing feel to it.
Breakfast had a good variety, and the hotel bar made great cocktails!
Hotel is well located, across the road from Temple Bar, and the staff were very accommodating with all of our travel needs.
The only thing that I can fault the hotel on is that wifi is not available for free in the hotel rooms which seems a bit odd in todays day and age.
Otherwise, very happy & will definately return!",5,2013,10,06
202,Amazing hotel.,"My friend and I stayed in this hotel for one night while going to a concert in Vicar Street. I'm afraid I can't comment on the price as my friend's parents paid for it, but the hotel itself was amazing. There was a lovely view from the hotel window, and the hotel rooms were immaculate. We also did not get a chance to visit the restaurant but other hotel guests we were speaking to said great things. The staff were very nice and friendly. There was also security at the door and we had to show our hotel room key to enter the hotel and I loved this because safety is very important to me.",5,2013,10,06
202,Beautiful hotel,The Westin is in a fantastic location with beautiful rooms with typical friendly westin service. Unfortunately the lack of free wifi and fridge use was a let down. If I wasn't using points I would probably have stayed somewhere cheaper. Overall though if you're up for a splurge this would the hotel. ,4,2013,10,06
202,Westin in the heart of Tourist Center,"Stayed 4 total nights, and I'd highly recommend it for someone who's staying about that long in Dublin.  It's right in the heart of the tourist center, walking distance to the Liffey, Trinity college (you must see the book of Kells and the Library), Grafton Street, St. Stephen's Green and of course the Temple Bar district (like, across the street).  What's nice is if you need a break from the European experience (for you Americans), you can grab a Subway sandwich and a Starbucks coffee across the street.

Typical Westin experience and accommodations, by that I mean you can expect a very friendly and well trained staff (the concierge boys were particularly memorable) a clean room, upgraded features, and of course...the aptly named heavenly bed - you simply cannot go wrong with this Starwood brand.

Next time I'm in Dublin, I will definitely be back.",5,2013,10,04
202,I wish we could have stayed longer.,"You can‚Äôt beat the location of this hotel!!  Its right next to Trinity College and just a few blocks from The Grafton Road shopping area, Temple Bar and a shot walk to Dublin Castle.  We actually walked from the hotel to the Guinness Storehouse which wasn‚Äôt bad but we did take a cab back.  This was by far the nicest hotel that I have stayed at.  We had two twin rooms and they were both very spacious and the beds were the most comfortable that we had for our entire trip.  The front desk staff was very helpful and arranged a van to get our group of 4 to the airport.  Unfortunately we didn‚Äôt eat in the restaurant so I can‚Äôt comment on that.  The only downfall is they do charge for wifi in your room.  They do have free wifi in the lobby.  If I make it back to Dublin I would definitely stay here again.",5,2013,10,03
202,Perfect location,"The Westin Dublin is located within walking distance of  most of Dublin""s major attractions and night life.  Temple Bar and Trinity College are right across the street. Shopping on Grafton Street is only a short walk away. 5 star comfortable spacious  quiet accommodation with friendly service.",5,2013,10,02
202,Our Best Hotel Experience in Europe,"The Westin Dublin is a hotel of the very highest order. Its location is unbeatable, its rooms are gorgeously appointed and spacious, with more amenities than I could count (much less remember), and its staff is kind, accommodating and professional. I stayed at the Westin just last week with my family, for four nights, and we all agreed that our rooms there were the best we'd experienced in all of our travels through Europe. Clean and comfortable, with ample space for storage and magnificent bathrooms, our rooms fast became a perfect home from home. I cannot recommend this hotel enough.",5,2013,10,01
202,Lovely hotel in great location,"We stayed at The Westin for 5 nights and really enjoyed it!  It is centrally located and we walked everywhere!  Shops, restaurants and pubs were steps away. There was a nice irish breakfast buffet in the restaurant on the first floor that we enjoyed and the Tearoom on the second floor was lovely with a high ceiling.  Apparently the hotel used to be a bank.  The Mint Bar in the basement used to be the vault and we loved the atmosphere and enjoyed live music there at night. The room was very spacious as was the bathroom. The beds were very comfortable.  The only issue we had was a musty damp smell in the room.  When I called about it they were nice and tried very hard to fix it. The staff were very friendly and accomodating. I would definitely stay here again!",4,2013,10,01
202,"Location, Location","We are Starwood members so we always like to try out their hotels when we travel. The Westin chain is never a disappointment. As usual with this hotel they are in one of the best locations to walk everywhere. Temple Bar and Trinity College are across the street. Most places are in walking distance. We had a great room, comfy and quiet. Their breakfast is good and their service is very good too. Lovely Atrium inside for tea or a pre-dinner drink. Good value .",4,2013,10,01
202,solid and honest 5* property,"great location, friendly and well qualified staff, nice rooms (the larger deluxe rooms are really nice), good room service, great breakfast in a nice setting, clean and fresh appearance overall

no doubt, will return when back in dublin.",5,2013,10,01
202,Absolute luxury in unbeatable location,"This was our second stay here: we thought our son and his fiancee might appreciate a weekend in Dublin (they did), and would like a bit of luxury (they did). At this rate, they won't need to worry about inheritance tax...Not cheap, particularly if you succumb (as we did) to the offer of an upgrade when we arrived. Full marks to the desk staff for letting us choose from the various types of room available. Massive amount of wardrobe/drawer space, which seems to be less and less common these days. Couldn't fault the staff: brilliant concierge, really helpful reception, excellent bar. Can recommend the Friday night salsa as viewing entertainment rather than participating. Free bottled water, replenished, in room: a nice touch. Unlike some other reviewers, we thoroughly enjoyed the breakfast (included in our room rate). On top of all this, the location is absolutely unbeatable.",5,2013,09,30
202,A very mixed bag,"Dublin was busy and was attending a trade conference with some work colleagues - Our usual haunts were booked out so stayed in Westin.:

Location excellent , Concierge pleasant & valet parking appreciated - Good start.

The Foyer was nice and we had a drink & snack in pleasant surroundings in bar before going out to dinner in  Shanaghans ( Beautiful meal by the way ).

On our return we still had plenty to discuss and decided to head to residents bar - there was none. We requested a drink from the night staff who said it was only available in bedrooms. We asked to have one charged to room but delivered to atrium or foyer but none available.

We had one drink sent to our bedroom and resumed discussions/negotiations , but shortly had a request from neighbouring room to be quiet. We were not drunk or rowdy , and merely discussing business but felt forced to cut short our discussions and retire for the night. 

Our requests to have a drink and somewhere to talk were treated curtly ( rudely ) by night staff and marred our trip significantly.

On reading the in room literature it said the breakfast was available until 11.30. We nipped out for a stroll and chat before returning for breakfast at 10.45 only to be told that breakfast was over & nothing was available. ( We could order to the bedroom until 11.30 but otherwise breakfast stops @ 10am). Our mistake for not checking properly but we were never told of cut off time when checking in .

Summary ,
Great location , nice foyer & bar area , dated and slightly musty corridors/rooms but overall not a bad package.
For any social event or work related activity where you might want late facilities to socialise or work it is not suitable & night staff are not interested in any kind of service or facilitation of requests.

Had to go to Cafe for breakfast due to miscommunication so can`t comment on that. Might stay again for location provided I planned to be in bed early , but would hope usual hotels ( Fitzwilliam or Merrion) were available instead .",3,2013,09,29
202,Lovely hotel,"We stayed for 6 nights at the Westin Dublin and liked the hotel very much. Our room (a ""Writers Room"") was excellent, quite spacious with two windows, a large flat screen TV, excellent tea and coffee making facilities and a mini-bar (oddly with little in it). Bottled water was free and was replaced daily. There was loads of drawer and wardrobe space, a welcome change from some other recent experiences. The bed was very comfortable. The bathroom was large and modern with a tiled floor ( a bit cold - could have done with slippers to go with the robes!) Everything was beautifully maintained and spotlessly clean. Service from the concierges was excellent; they helped a great deal with the problem of a bag missing at the airport. All the staff were extremely helpful and pleasant. We ate once in the Mint Bar, where both food and service was lovely. The only disappointment for us was breakfast. On the first day we paid 19.50 euros each for the full Irish breakfast, but it really wasn't good enough for that price (scrambled egg, not great and no other choices, unpleasant sausages). We stuck with the continental breakfast after that, which was 14.50 and quite acceptable. One day I ordered a special granola with fresh fruit and yoghurt, quite small and nowhere near worth the 11.50 charged. Service at breakfast sometimes got a bit chaotic. The breakfast disappointment was a pity, as otherwise our experience at this hotel was extremely positive. If you take a car and plan to be out and about only to leave it overnight, you may wish to avoid the hotel's car park charge of 25 euros by parking across the road (off Fleet Street) for 9 euros (from 6pm to 9am). As everyone else has said, the hotel is superbly situated.",4,2013,09,26
202,Not impressed with service,"Stayed here for 7 weeks over a long business trip. 

Overall the experience is great - excellent location in city center, clean, classy room with good amenity. For instance, it is not common to have 24/7 gym facilities at a good hotel in Ireland. I was training for marathon and it's almost impossible to run outdoor in Dublin during the winter - so the 24/7 gym was my best friend. The Irish buffet breakfast is nice and hearty - staff in the restaurant are friendly and could address me by name after my first week of stay (can't match Four Season standard yet).

However, I am not super impressed with some of the service. For instance, as some other reviewer pointed out, there is no staff standing at the front door. When you arrive with your luggage, no one will come out to help you haul the luggage. This is even worse when you find there is a few steps to climb before reaching the reception desks. I pointed it out to the manager but it doesn't seem to be solved yet. 

SPG recognition seems to be poor too. During my entire stay of 7 weeks, there was nothing other than some fruits on first check-in night. Granted that my whole stay was considered one stay as I didn't check out, but thought they could have done a better job rewarding a long term loyal customer.",4,2013,09,25
202,"Overpriced, hyped up, very average hotel","Living & working in Dublin, I decided to splash out on a stay here when friends were visiting. They put the three of us on three completely floors.  Rooms were nice, had a lot of character. Staff were average, at most. Breakfast was terrible, for a hotel that rates itself so highly.",3,2013,09,25
202,Great option for central Dublin,"Stayed for three nights R&R using Starpoints in August 2013.

I will agree with other commentators - there was no bell staff when we arrived, so I lugged our case up the stairs (there is a slope, but it is well hidden).

Reception were friendly & helpful, and our room overlooking the edge of Temple Bar was fine, what I would expect from a Westin in an old building. Although we looked over the main road it wasn't noisy & we slept well.

We had the Starpoints complimentary continental breakfast each day & it was excellent.

We tried the basement bar, but although there was a great jazz vocalist playing, it lacks atmosphere & the service was not great.

Of course, the key thing here is location and this hotel has it - literally minutes from everywhere.

I would stay here again.",4,2013,09,19
202,Perfect Location to Enjoy Dublin,"Stayed a couple of nights during Dublin tourist visit.  Its location is exceptional right next to Trinity College and across the street from Temple Bar area.  Easy to walk/stumble to the best parts of Dublin.

The city is very walkable though we took the double decker bus tour right off to get a feel for the city and see where we wanted to come back.  The pick up for all the busses is within a few hundred feet of the hotel including the tourist and airport busses.  

The hotel is very upscale but not stuffy.  Great entry way and easy check-in.  The rooms were Westin quality and larger than most city hotels.  We had a king and actually had a real king versus a queen or smaller (make sure you ask in most hotels - many call a double a king).  Our room had windows into the atrium area on the interior of the hotel so not a great view, but we were very happy with the bed and layout.  Everything was top notch including linens and bathroom.  Very large and comfortable.

We had dinner in the Vault restaurant downstairs (the building was an old bank and the basement was the actual vault).  Food was very good for standard irish fare.  We enjoyed the atmosphere very much with many people talking to us from adjoining tables.  Not intrusive but very happy to chat and see where we were from.  There was  special charity event the evening we were there and Miss Ireland came waltzing through - even took pictures with our group.  Sure that happens all the time!

Great location to head over the Temple Bar area.  We were able to walk to most of the attractions throughout the city.  Great base for a city visit.",4,2013,09,19
202,"Exemplary, discreet hotel in a crazy city(!)","I stayed here for 3 nights on business - this was probably my 4th or 5th stay here - am a regular at the Starwood group - and was generally realy looking forward to this trip.

When I arrived there was no queue for check-in - everything was very efficient and quick and the staff were extremely curteous.

The room was fabulous - and the room service (, both menu and food) was also great on the one occasion I experienced. Breakfast, too, was extremely good.

I can't help noticing a big mix of reviews for this hotel. I think you'll find that if you're an SPG then you will receive less ""benefits"" than usual - simply as Dublin will be the first port of call for many tourists from accross the Atlantic. If I'm forced to criticize, then all I could say is that the fitness/leisure services are maybe not as glamourous as some other 4/5-star properties - and maybe the Westin lacks some of the buzz of Dublin's other ""VIP"" properties - but personally that's something that I like!",5,2013,09,19
202,Wonderful stay!,"My husband and I arrived very early (5AM) and though we requested an early check-in we knew it was unlikely at this time! We were greeted warmly, checked in and our luggage was stored. The guest service agent brought us to a guest lounge to relax and rest and even provided us with a pitcher of iced water. We were able to check in around noon (took a quick nap!) The beds were so comfortable and the room was tastefully furnished. Our room over-looked the atrium.  We strolled around the charming city and had lunch. In the evening we had dinner at the Exchange Restaurant in the hotel and thoroughly enjoyed the service and the food. We booked the Westin for a 2 night stay before our cruise to relax and tour the city. I really enjoyed our stay! The people in Dublin are so friendly and hospitable. High marks to the Westin for their customer service and quality. Overall a memorable and perfect stay! I will definitely recommed to my clients!",5,2013,09,19
202,Brilliant location with a friendly welcome.,"Arrived for a two night stay before moving on to another town but decided to stay an extra two nights as atmosphere and friendliness good. We enjoyed a delicious afternoon tea with my husband taking the peculiar tea (gin based) rather than the traditional. The bar food was good and gave percentage off for your next meal - good idea to award loyalty. Concierge,porters and the doorman very helpful and friendly. Good choice at breakfast with refreshing pure juice and lovely bread and fruit. We will definitely be back and would recommend this hotel.",5,2013,09,17
202,Huge disappointment!,"The only thing this hotel has going for it is the outstanding location. The service was terrible: no bellman when we arrived at 4:00pm, rarely a concierge on duty, and little help from reception. Housekeeping, however, was excellent. The room, while large, was dated, the temperature could not be accurately controlled, the TV speaker in the bathroom could not be muted or even lowered to a consistent level, and the mini bar is one that automatically and instantly charges when items are moved. Even the ""heavenly bed"" was lumpy and the linens were scratchy. We are Starwood Preferred Guests Gold, and upon check-in were offered an upgrade for a fee. As the rate we were paying was ‚Ç¨324 per night for 5 nights, we turned down that opportunity. ",2,2013,09,16
202,Will not stay here again,"My husband and I are both SPG Platinum members (we are also owners at St Regis Aspen) and have stayed at many Starwood hotels (as well as other fine hotels including many Four Seasons, Oberoi, Shangri-La, Ritz Carlton, etc.). We stayed here for 1 night on August 31, while we had an overnight from our London flight to NYC. First problem: When our taxi pulled up to the hotel, there was NO ONE helping us with our luggage. No bell person from the hotel was anywhere in sight, even after we waited several minutes on the sidewalk. We had to manage a lot of luggage on our own. 2nd problem: We opted for 500 SPG points as our SPG amenity since we had an early flight the next morning and did not have time for breakfast. We were not given our 500 points. I have tried multiple times to get this fixed but the hotel rejected our request, claiming we are not qualified for the 500 SPG points since we instead had complimentary breakfast while at the hotel . Ludicrous. We had never stepped into the hotel restaurant and definitely did not have breakfast at the hotel because we had to rush to the airport in the early morning. Overall, very poor customer service and not smart business strategy.  Why is the Westin Dublin even arguing with their SPG Platinum customers over 500 SPG points (we were told that this issue was presented to the manager at the hotel and our request was still declined!)? If we had breakfast at the hotel, there must be a logbook they can look at to confirm that information. Of course they will not be able to find any evidence to support their position because we did not eat at the hotel.",1,2013,09,16
202,Very very nice,"Excellent location , excellent service , excellent food. 
This is a quality hotel well worth paying that little bit extra for . 
Within walking distance of lots of sightseeing attractions and shops 
You will be in for a treat if you are planning to stay here, we will be back again very soon.",4,2013,09,16
202,Excellent Choice in Dublin,"This perfectly located, comfortable and elegant hotel was a highlight of our Ireland/England trip, and would be my first choice for a return trip to Dublin.  The room was perfectly appointed, tastefully and elegantly decorated, and adequately sized. More importantly, the king-sized bed was indeed heavenly, with excellent pillows. 

The lobby staff was warm, friendly and professional, our view over Trinity College was fine, and the room price we secured was very reasonable.   We took advantage of the laundry service and found it efficient, but quite expensive (as was the breakfast).",5,2013,09,15
202,Delightful Stay,"Between location, air-conditioning, service and room quality it is hard to beat the Dublin Westin.  It is a grand hotel.  It lacks the friendliness of a bed and breakfast, but sometimes opulence is a treasure, especially near Temple Bar, Trinity University and the River Liffey.

We arrived early when no room was available, but the clerk took our mobile number and gave us a ring the moment the room was ready.  Service can make a stay.",5,2013,09,15
202,Wonderful Westin location,"We enjoyed our short stay at the Westin; the location is wonderful, within walking distance of everything.  The service at the hotel was excellent with everyone (except for one young man at check in) friendly, efficient, and helpful.  Those who served at the concierge desk were especially competent and gracious about dispensing information; they went ""the extra mile"" to be of assistance.  Our room (spacious and clean) was adjoining some friends, and the unusually wide hallway behind the doors and between the two rooms still allowed for privacy.  Room service was prompt and provided 24-hour service. The Irish breakfast was all anyone could expect; however, at 7:00 am when the restaurant opened, there was always a crowd on the weekdays.",5,2013,09,11
202,Very Nice for a Chain,"On business travel I am not able to avoid staying at Global Hospitality Conglomerates, and even though I am a slave to the Marriott Rewards program I don't mind sacrificing 'points' to stay at a nice Westin. The Westin Dublin in the Temple Bar neighborhood is one of those special sorts of Westin properties. 

My room was spacious and very nicely appointed with an enormous bath (literally, a grown man could stretch out in the tub), walk-in closet and excellent room service. Truly a business travelers hotel, the desk space was ample with conveniently located outlets (always a chance of the dice) and great - if not complimentary - broadband access. In keeping with the meeting theme the conference rooms were nice if a big snug. Advice: If in doubt about the number of attendees, round up and go for the larger room. The catering was very good and the tech team was quick and efficient. 

This is also a great hotel for a holiday - as evidenced by the crowds of American tourists milling around the lobby. I felt a bit like I'd never left home, which is not a bad thing if you are an uneasy traveler. The Atrium lounge is comfortable and bright and serves a lovely tea. As for location, the Westin is blocks from Trinity College (and the Book of Kells), a very handy shopping district, the old Parliament, Dublin Castle and many other attractions.",4,2013,09,11
202,Consistent,"The usual Westin standard, good beds, pillows, bathroom was spacious, Sam at the desk was great and helped us Find 2 good restaurants and a medical person. Great Sipsmiths gin and tonic down in mint bar.  Good continental breakfast , comprehensive 14 Euros",4,2013,09,10
202,Lovely Hotel Ruined by the Guests,"This is a typical very standard hotel, with superior rooms with plenty of space and all the things you need.  Central location to all the night spots and tourist attraction, it could not be better situated.
The restaurents and bar are also the best, with live jazz on the night we were there.  Unfortunately there were a lot of drunk guests who ruined the whole enviroment, it was disappointing but the hotel tried there best but they were also guests in a 5 star hotel.",4,2013,09,09
202,always happy to return here,"This is my 5th stay at the Westin Dublin in as many years, and my 2nd stay in the space of less than 9 months, both times here for 2 weeks, so the hotel really does become a home away from home. It's a splurge, but well worth it.  The rooms are very comfortable and beautifully designed, with a reserved modern take on traditional Irish elements.  The beds are so comfy and the bathrooms are bright, well lit and well appointed, with plenty of room for your toiletries on the shelves above the sink.  And the bathroom has a feature that I really enjoy: a speaker so you can listen to the TV or radio while in the shower.  

All rooms have lots of closet and drawer space, something I found curiously lacking when I stayed at the Radisson Blu a year back (because the Westin was completely full) - the executive rooms had extra space for a sofa and coffee table and also a Nespresso machine, which is a really nice touch, but there were no drawers in the closet.  I guess all their business comes from weekenders or business travelers who don't have much to unpack.  

But back to the Westin... The location, at the top of Westmoreland Street, right at College Green, is prime - you're within walking distance of everything.  

The service at the hotel is generally excellent.  This winter, I used quite a lot of room service which is expensive, but the food is very good.  I remember a very tasty soup (I think it was leek and potato), though it seems to have been discontinued, which, together with a side salad (with a delicious dressing) was a complete meal.  The sticky toffee dessert was a fave (sadly also off the menu, maybe it's a seasonal thing), and the beef medallions, and the afternoon tea is fantastic, especially the scones.  I also appreciate that the kitchen will be flexible, so if you're jetlagged and wake up in the middle of the night and all you crave is some tea and toast, they'll accommodate you.  I appreciate the fact that they have 24-hour room service.  And I see that they've now added an option most nights of the week where you can order up some items off the menu of the hotel's Exchange restaurant, which is a great idea.

The hotel staff is quite international, reflecting the face of cosmopolitan Dublin.  On my last visit I met employees from India, Malaysia, the Philippines, Holland, Poland and even Syria.  I've always found them extremely polished, pleasant and friendly.

If I have one complaint, it would be the cost of in-room Internet access (7 days = 50 Euros).  I realize that now most people don't use the hotel phones to make expensive local or long distance calls, a hotel needs a way to generate that missing income, but as a guest, it really is quite frustrating and just feels like gouging.",5,2013,09,08
202,Amazing location and posh property,"We stayed here for 2 nights in late July 2013.  The property is located in an ideal spot, convenient to all city center attractions.  You can access Grafton Street and Temple Bar easily from this hotel.  Despite the location, the rooms are very quiet.  They live up to the Westin standard, having luxurious bedding and amazing bathrooms.  The staff were very professional and helpful.  The concierge, in particular, gave great tips on local restaurants and pubs that would not be too touristy.  Across the street is a major bus stop that includes the shuttle bus to and from the ferryport.  Very convenient.  This hotel is highly recommended if you want location and comfort.",5,2013,09,08
202,Central location,"Stayed here for 3 nights in August 2013. 
Arrived in the afternoon and caught a taxi- 20-25 Euros with a tip-  from the airport. You could catch the bus if you didn't have too much luggage. The streets are busy and pavements a bit uneven at times to be lugging heavy bags.

We had requested a room with a view of Trinity college. On check in they told us that the roof of the building next door interfered with the view and was that OK? Not having seen the room we thought that it wouldn't be an issue, but when we got to the room we understood what she meant! The roof from the neighbouring building completely blocked the view!! The room was very large and had a great bathroom, so we just let that go, as a bit of a joke!!
Very happy with the room. comfy bed, lots of room. The bathroom had a separate bath and shower.
Breakfast was in our rate and was delicious. Also got free Wi Fi and that worked well.

Our only gripe was the noise. We could hear our neighbours at night and early in the morning. Nothing too disruptive.
Staff very helpful and friendly.

There was work being done outside the hotel on the street and that detracted from the entry a bit.
The location was wonderful and it was an easy walk to all things. Even did our washing in Dublin at the American Laundry. Great service for 2-3 hours washed and dried and folded for 10.50 Euros! A bargain. You can easily walk to this laundry. 

Good location and comfortable room.",4,2013,09,07
202,Great Location,"Room are clean and comfortable. Staff -- with name tags that identify their passion -- are super.  Perfect location -- go left for St. Stephen's Green, etc. and right for O'Connell Street, and straight on for the castle and churches.  No need for the hop on/hop off bus -- you can walk everywhere.",4,2013,09,06
202,Centrally located Upscale Hotel,"We stayed at the Westin for 5 nights while visiting with family and touring the City.  I was with my 8 year old son and appreciated that the hotel had some rooms with twin beds as he has outgrown the cot stage.  The hotel is about a block away from the Air Link bus stop which is very convenient.  If you fly into Dublin I recommend this bus.  It was $10 euros round trip.  We bought the combo pass which also gave us 2 days of access to the hop on hop off tourist double decker bus, a must with kids.  The hotel is within walking distance of Trinity College, Grafton Street, St Stephen's Green, O'Connell Street and Temple Bar.  We did not hear any street noise except on Sunday night after the hurling championships which found everyone celebrating in Temple Bar.  Our rate included breakfast and free wifi.  The breakfast was great and is in a beautiful room overlooking the street.  Breakfast is a large buffet, cereal, scones, hot eggs, sausages, Irish bacon, smoke salmon, variety of meats, muffins, croissants, etc.  If you stay, I recommend adding the breakfast.  Due to the huge breakfast we only ate one other big meal a day.  Only thing that would have made it perfect would have been live music in the downstairs bar but it was easy to go out and hear music in the pubs.  We went to Merchants Arch in the late afternoon for music before it got too rowdy.  The staff was very helpful and attentive, especially with suggestions for kid activities or directing us on the map.  We would definitely stay here again.",4,2013,09,05
202,"Great location - walk to  food, fun, and culture","We stayed here before and after a tour of Ireland. Both rooms were lovely and spacious. Super bathrooms with great showers. Location is excellent. Walk to Temple Bar, Trinity College, Dublin Castle, St. Patrick's and Christ Church cathedrals. Service was friendly and helpful.",5,2013,09,05
202,"Beautiful Hotel, Great Location, superb service but one drawback!","We stayed at this fabulous hotel and found the service nothing short of superb. At one point, I was trying to cross Westmoreland Street, a very busy, street to join my husband. One of the staff came out, stopped the traffic and brought me across. Anytime we wanted to go anywhere, they drew on a map exactly where we should go. They were helpful to a fault. 
There was only one drawback, their restaurants were not particularly good. We had the room with breakfast and other than the pastries, the fruit, and the scones, the food was not well prepared. One night, we had salads which were okay. I would definitely stay there again and recommend it for the superb location 1/2 block from The magnificent Trinity College and very near excellent shopping.",5,2013,09,04
202,"Great Location Near the Green, Temple Bar","Beautiful hotel in a great location for exploring Dublin on foot.  Hotel staff is friendly, rooms are spacious (by European Standards) and smartly designed.  Close to EVERYTHING...Temple Bar, Guinness Storehouse, St. James, etc., but still far enough away from the madness.  Everything you'd come to expect from a top-notch Westin as well.  Gold/Platinum members likely to get the upgrade as well.  Highly recommend!",5,2013,09,04
202,Close to Temple Bar,"My family and I had a very good experience at the Westin Dublin in July.  It was the beginning of a 9 day tour of Ireland, and the Westin was a great location to be able to see the city.  It is adjacent to Trinity College (and the Book of Kells), as well as the Temple Bar section of the city where there are great pubs, restaurants and night life.  It is also close to Grafton Street, where all the shopping is.  The Hotel was clean and quiet, and the service was excellent.  They also have a great afternoon tea.  It is a great place to stay if you want to walk around the city!",4,2013,09,04
202,Friendly Staff and Great Location!,"Upon our arrival, we were warmly greeted.  Our room was not available yet but we gave our cell number and went next door to Trinity College and The Book of Kells.  (I was glad it worked out that way as I'm sure I would have laid down after an overnight flight from the States and really messed up my body clock!). 

Our room was ready when we got back from our tour and our bags had already been delivered.  The room was lovely and overlooked Trinity College!  The bus stop was right outside our window, which was fine as we could look out to see what the locals were wearing to help us decide what to wear that day.  

The hotel is also right across the street from the Temple Bar district.  Great pubs for dinner and pints.  The Hop On Hop Off bus stop was just on the far side of Trinity College entrance - less than a block away.

The gym was small but had what we wanted to clear our minds and get rid of some of the overindulgences!  

Breakfast was included with our reservation and the restaurant was pretty good.  It was a buffet, not huge but good. Service was a bit slow getting seated and getting coffee.  They seemed a bit understaffed.

All in all, a wonderful experience!",5,2013,09,04
202,In the Heart of Dublin,"The Westin Dublin is located in a former bank building, one block from Trinity College and across the street, but not in the Temple Bar area. 

You could not ask for a better location.

The staff is friendly and the concierge staff are especially knowledgeable about Dublin and will make any reservation or booking you could possibly ask for.

If you want a quiet room, ask for an interior room. These rooms overlook a six story atrium in the centre of the building. In the basement of the atrium is the bar, which is quiet and classy. 

The rooms are beautifully furnished and the beds are very comfortable. 

I would highly recommend this hotel for your stay in Dublin.",5,2013,09,03
202,Great hotel,"This was a great hotel in a great area. It is within walking distance to all the major sites. Only downfall is it is hard to find your way back. It is in the middle of the block between to larger buildings. Trinity college is close by as well the Jamison Distillery and St. Patricks Cathedral. Great location for people who want to explore the city by foot. The rooms are standard Westin rooms with all the bells and whistles. The rooms do not have a view. My room faced a seating area within the hotel. The staff is very helpful and friendly, the food was great. I ordered the Irish breakfast and was not disappointed. All around enjoyable stay.",4,2013,09,03
202,great place to stay,"This hotel is centrally located. You can't find a better location for your stay in Dublin.We walked every where from here.  There are plenty of places to eat, bars, shops, ice cream in the area. We felt very safe.   The suites are large enough for a family , some are two levels. They can be a bit dark but you won't be spending much time in your room. This hotel could use some updating but the public rooms are very nice, formal and stately. The rooms are very clean , the breakfast is very good and above all the staff is very kind and helpful.  You will enjoy your stay here.",5,2013,09,02
202,Great Concierge and Service at the Mint Bar,"The hotel is beautiful and decorated to a very high standard. The staff were very polite and attentive, especially the concierge from Hungary! Customer service at breakfast and the Mint Bar was very good, the food was delicious. The cocktail menu at the Mint Bar was unbelievable - as well as the cocktails!

The room was designed beautifully with incredibly comfortable beds and a spacious bathroom. Unfortunatelly there was no free WiFi in the room, however we got complimentary bottles of water.

There was an incident with our luggage, as one of the bags was misplaced and it took a while until we got it back. Apparently it was carried up to one of the guest rooms.

Overall, we had a great experience and would recommend this hotel for anyone wishing to explore Dublin, as its location is perfect - only a few steps away from shopping and nightlife!",4,2013,08,30
202,Nice hotel and location,"Nice hotel and location, obviously at a price. The hotel is located right in the center of most attractions and very close to the city tour stops. Service is excellent but you couldn't expect any less considering price and name of the hotel. Highly recommend it.",5,2013,08,29
202,Maybe the best hotel in Dublin City Centre,"Stayed here for one night while on business in Dublin.  I remember when this old building was a bank!  The hotel interior is beautiful, decorated to a very high standard. Food in the Mint bar and The Exchange restauraunt was of a very high standard, with customer service across all teams very very good.

This was my first time staying in a Westin hotel and I was very impressed.  The bedroom was decroated to a very high standard with all the amenities you would expect for business or leisure. There was also a complimnetary water bottle in my car when the concierge brought it back from the car park - this was a really nice touch.

From a location perspective you could not be in a more central location, the view from my bedroom window was of Trinity College and the hotel is far enough away from the noisy Temple Bar.

Very very nice hotel and I look forward to coming back and staying here on a leisure trip in the coming months!",5,2013,08,29
202,Beautiful hotel in a great location,"We are Starwood Platinum members, so I don't know if all people who visit this hotel have this experience, but this was a great place to stay in a great location (right near Trinity College).  Also, my flight arrived very early after a long red-eye from Seattle, so I requested an early check in.  Before the trip, I received an e-mail saying that they didn't know if they could accommodate that request, so I didn't have high expectations. Anyway, when I arrived, they were able to accommodate the request and I was able to get in a nap before touring Dublin.  

Here's one small complaint/request for the hotel- when people arrive from a long distance away, most are jet-lagged and wake up very early.  Almost nothing in Dublin opens until I think either 7 or 8 am.  There's no coffee in the room and I saw a pot in the lobby- I thought the coffee was for guests, but apparently it was for a tour group heading out.  Anyway, here's an idea- have a pot of coffee for ALL the guests, as it can be difficult to get a cup of coffee anywhere near the hotel for a few hours after you wake up.  I know the idea is to go and pay for it, but how hard would it be to just provide one complimentary cup.  Again, that's just an idea, but I think that would be very appreciated by guests...",5,2013,08,28
202,Excellent concierge,"Earlier this month my husband and I stayed at Westin, Dublin for 2 nights prior to road-tripping across Ireland. Location perfect, room comfortable and Concierge, Darragh - incredibly helpful! Two superb restaurants suggested. Only disappointment - lack of free WiFi to rooms - a must in this era.",5,2013,08,28
202,Great hotel in a great location in City Centre,"We stayed at the Westin during our trip in Ireland and enjoyed both the hotel property and its ideal location.  It is a few steps from Trinity College, shopping, and the fun night life of Dublin.  Like all Westin's, the bed was fantastic and the property very clean.  The staff were all very attentive and polite, adding to our enjoyable stay.  We arrived by taxi which was easy, but arriving by car would be a bit of a challenge.",4,2013,08,26
202,Very Nice Hotel,"My family and I stayed at the Westin Dublin this past June. The location was fantastic-right next to Trinity University, and within walking distance of many fine restaurants and pubs. The hotel is very clean, and the staff is very polite. Although we were in town as part if a family vacation, I am sure that it serves extremely well for business travelers as well. I recommend it for location, cleanliness, and style.",4,2013,08,24
202,The place to stay in Dublin,"The Westin Dublin was a great experience, especially as a SPG member.  The hotel is so perfectly located, you can walk to everything and anything in the city.  From the hotel, you are across the street from Trinity College and the Book of Kells and 2 blocks from Grafton Street.

When we first arrived, our room was not quite ready (we also showed up about 5 hours before check-in) but they were kind enough to keep our bags and brought them up to the room for us when it was ready before we got back from exploring the city.

We also had complimentary water bottles every morning and the place was always spotless.  I would definitely recommend the Westin to anyone visiting the city of Dublin.",5,2013,08,22
202,Heaven!!,"We stayed at the Westin whilst having a weekend break in Dublin to see the Eminem concert. The hotel is very beautiful stylish, it really was perfect. 
The rooms were fantastic; a huge bed, stocked minibar, gorgeous thick curtains, and  beautiful marble bathroom. The room was cleaned everyday.
Breakfast has a huge selection to choose from, although I wasnt too impressed with sausages. However if you are after the full Irish breakfast I would recommend a local pub where you can buy a huge breakfast for 9.50euros a head. 
We also enjoyed the Mint Bar downstairs, although we found it a little pricey, although it was a novelty having my cocktail served me to in the finest china teacups!!
One of my favourite things were the flowers my husband had ordered in advance for our room. They were absolutely beautiful flowers, and still looked fresh after 3 days.
There was one small hiccup with our booking being lost (I think the person I had booked it through hadnt spelt my last name correctly), however they soon found the reservation and also offered us a discounted breakfast for the trouble.
The hotel really was faultless and I wish we didnt have to leave!!",5,2013,08,22
202,Great Hotel - Centrally located,Great hotel with Westin standards. Friendly staff but the hotel is very busy as it is centrally located to all the sight seeing areas. Everything is in walkable distance. Trinity College is just 5 min away. Rooms were a bit tiny but very clean and tidy. Bathrooms were very nice too. The service at the bar sucked. We waited for 30 mins with none to take our order and we finally left. We did not park but from what we heard it was a hassle. Great stay- Will definitely come back.,5,2013,08,21
202,A short vacation,"We stayed at the Westin for 4 days.  It is well located in Dublin in the shopping district and Temple Bar area.  Plenty of things to do near the hotel and with in reasonable walking distance to many attractions.  Arriving at 1 in the morning, we were met outside the hotel and offered assistance with the bags and parking the car.  This was surprising being so late at night.  The staff are very friendly and willing to help with anything.  The rooms are nice and the staff keep them clean.  The room does offer 1 outlet with standard american plug receptacles.  The only disappointing issue was having to pay for wifi in the rooms.  It was free in the common areas and they had computers available in the business center, but not in the rooms.",4,2013,08,21
202,"Extreme disappointment with service at Westin, Dublin","We stayed at the Westin Dublin for 2 nights in early August with Starwood Preferred Guest points.  We reserved 2 rooms.  Check-in is 3pm.  We arrived around 1:00 and were told that the rooms were not ready.  We returned at 3:00, and only 1 room was ready.  We were promised that the other room would be ready shortly, and they would come downstairs to the Mint Bar to get us when it was ready.  No one came down, so we asked the bartender to check on it.  Again,  we were told it would be ready soon.  The room was not ready until 4:30.  When we complained, we were offered a Jr. Suite for an additional $69 Euro per night!  Imagine that, when SPG guests are supposed to get early check-in (if available), and upgrades when available.  The rooms were very nice and comfortable, however, this delay made us waste most of our first day in Dublin.  The restaurants in the hotel are extremely expensive.  The only positive other than the comfort of the rooms is that it is in a great location.",3,2013,08,20
202,Fabulous!,"First- location is beyond compare. Dublin is a city that's easy to get around, hard to get lost in anyway- but there's no better central location. Knowing the lay out of things now I wouldn't stay anywhere else. 

The hotel is b-e-a-utiful. as clean as you'd expect from a Westin and outfitted classically like a Ritz. I got a room with a city view and was concerned about traffic noise but even being on a lower level street side it was SILENT. I had an upgraded Queen room that was surprisingly spacious, well-appointed and being a single female there for an occasion had abundant room for all my girly do-dads - two closets and a huge bathroom with plenty of shelving. Kudos on all the technology conveniences- USB plugs, iPod alarm clock base and whoa- never missed the TV news since there are speakers in the bathroom. The bedding is a dream. Loved it! 

I enjoyed the staff immensely. More than once they accommodated me and remembered things such as my seating and beverage choices.  Of special note, Peter the door man- He was so helpful and generous with solid advice. He took wonderful care of me- everything from recommended activities to ringing up his wife for hat shop recommendations to making sure I had a good cabbie. Truly an asset to the hotel and just a lovely human - and the first time in all my travels I felt inclined to hug a hotel staff member goodbye. 

The included Irish breakfast was just okay. The continental would serve most just fine, so if the rate is at question and you're choosing between them, go for the Continental. 

You couldn't have a better location for a wedding, for business, for a honeymoon. Obviously I am impressed and I don't impress easy on name alone. I got a great pre-paid rate through SPG which definitely added to the value. Go for the WiFi included package. 

A few things weren't perfect but they were addressed immediately to my satisfaction so I can't give a valid complaint about my own experience. For me, staff went above and beyond to please me. However - one small incident but of note to the GM: The only downside to the stay was a rude night manager - not rude to me mind you,  but I was alarmed at his tone and attitude with a fellow event attendee who was not rude or belligerent and IMO didnt deserve the impertinence. Another attendee overheard the conversation as well and explained that customer service in Ireland isn't what it is in the US- and to that I say nonsense. Rude is rude, the end- attitude and time define that, not words alone. Improve that bit and it would be a five-plus-star experience.

202,I want to go back!,"The Westin Dublin is the first 5* hotel I'd been to the previous March! We stayed at room 121!

It's location is amazing because we were in Dublin for three days and we went everywhere on foot! 

The staff was very kind and helpful and the room was just amazing!

The breakfast was very good as well!

I can go on and on but I won't. It is just a hotel that is worth all five stars! 

I really want to go back and stay there again!",5,2013,08,18
202,Posh ambience with Youth-Hostel level service....,"**This Review is just for the Afternoon Tea they serve**

Having Afternoon Tea at a posh Hotel is one of those things that I absolutely love to do every few months. It gives me an excuse to wear an extra nice dress and my fancy heels. So when I walked into The Westin for Traditional Afternoon Tea, I was very excited and had high expectations (after having had a wonderful experience at The Westbury Hotel a few months ago). 

We had reserved in advance (recommended, if you still want to come here after reading the review, that is) and were shown a table in the corner of the Atrium, which was a bit more quiet. The waiter who had greeted us wasn't overwhelmingly friendly, but alright. He handed us menus and it took his colleague a good 10 minutes until he took our order. We opted for the traditional afternoon tea (they also have the ""Most Peculiar Afternoon Tea"" with some not-so-traditional foods) and both wanted tea instead of coffee. When I asked the waiter what sort of teas they had, he briskly replied ""Well. English Breakfast Tea. And then I suppose we have Green tea, Peppermint, Earl Grey and I think Camomile..."" I opted for the Green tea, although I was slightly irritated at this point already - the menu had said ""Choose from a wide range of teas and coffees"" so my question about the teas shouldn't have been unexpected....

It took about ten minutes for the tea & food to arrive, and I'll just go with bullet points here.

+ Tea was served loose in a glass pot. Now, everyone who has had Green tea before knows that it shouldn't steep for longer than 2 mins. This, however, was impossible as there was no tea strainer and thus, I was unable to remove the loose tea leaves. I ended up not being able to drink the rest of my tea because it was way too bitter.
+ Selection of food was good, the sandwiches were tasty and so were the scones and the lemon poppyseed loaf. The desserts were OK, some of them way too sweet - the red velvet cupcake had too much frosting and too little dough. 
+ Service was very, very inattentive and therefore, really brought the whole experience down. Not once were we asked whether we wanted something else or whether everything was alright while we were eating. We had finished our food and teas for about 15 minutes until one of the waiters came over and asked us whether we wanted more water for our tea. We did, but that didn't make the tea more drinkable.
+ We were ready to pay and leave, but after 20 minutes of throwing very obvious looks at the waiter, we finally gave up and stood up to walk over to the Bar and pay our bill. This was probably the tip of the iceberg for me. 

This is a 5 Star Hotel, but the service is that of a Youth Hostel. I've rarely experienced such inattentive service at Hotels. Not refilling drinks, not asking whether the food is OK, not asking whether we'd like to order something else, not recognizing the universally known signs for ""I WANT TO PAY!!!"" - totally unacceptable in my books. We weren't the only ones experiencing this - when I had a look around, we saw several tables waiting to either order food, pay their bills or waiting for more drinks. Considering that Afternoon Tea is quite pricey, I would have expected way more. Food was nice and so was the Atmosphere in the Atrium, but the bad service really prevents me from ever going back there again.",2,2013,08,18
202,Centralised comfort,"We were impressed by the family like friendliness of the staff and the very convenient central location. Handy to everything.
The catering was also very good and we enjoyed the meals we had there.
Our room was large and comfortable ,as was the bathroom,with a good sized shower recess.
Overall, we were very satisfied.",5,2013,08,17
202,Fantastic Location,I've stayed at this hotel a few times both for fun and work and the location is fantastic. You couldn't find a better situated hotel with easy access to locations around the city and outside of Dublin. There are lots of great restaurants and places to see right outside your door and staff has always been helpful. The mint bar is also fantastic and the staff is extremely helpful. My only complaint is the breakfast at the hotel is average and when comparing it to options at other Westin facilities the options are much more limited. This is more consistent with European hotels but it didn't distract from the overall positive experience I've continued to have at the hotel.,4,2013,08,16
202,"Beautiful Hotel, Wonderful Location.","We could not have asked for a nicer stay in Dublin.  The Westin is absolutely beautiful, staff were more than friendly and helpful.  An ATM is steps away from the front entrance and Trinity College is just a few steps more.  The hotel is close to major Dublin attractions.  Our room was well-appointed, very clean and comfortable.  The weather was quite warm while in Dublin and we especially appreciated the two large water dispensers containing fresh lime slices, mint, oranges and lemons in the lobby.  A nice touch that was very welcome upon our return from a long, hot day of touring beautiful Dublin.  Would stay here again in a heartbeat!",5,2013,08,15
202,A Dandy in Dublin,"We absolutely enjoyed our time in the Westin in Dublin. The staff was so friendly in helpful, and it has the best location in Dublin next to Trinity College, a jump to nearby Grafton Street, and Temple Bar, not to mention all the National Museums, which are all free. You are also walking distance to Dublin Castle, and the Chester Beatty Museum. I would recommend the Hop on Hop off bus tour. The Room at the Westin was lovely, and we so enjoyed the tea in the beautiful dining areas. We will be back.",5,2013,08,14
202,Great Location,"It is located in a great location ~ just blocks from Trinity College.  It has nice rooms, and a friendly reception staff though the breakfast staff and concierge could have been more helpful. Its close proximity to so many wonderful places to see in Dublin make it worth while!",4,2013,08,14
202,Great Place to Stay in Dublin,"I stayed here from Aug 3 thru Aug 6.  This hotel was fantastic.  The service was top notch, including (but not limited to) the check in staff, the bar staff, and the Doorman.  They all provided service much better then expected.  Everyone was warm and welcoming.  The room was quite pleasant.  Once we left Dublin we stayed in many different hotels and it was by far the best.  It was larger then I expected for Dublin.  It was quite clean and the bed very comfortable.  Also the WiFi was very good in the hotel, where as all around the city (and country) we had difficulties with WiFi.  And the location is absolutely PHENOMENAL.  It is next door to Trinity College, across the street from the Temple Bar area, close walk to Grafton Street, St Stephen's Green, Dublin Castle, and many other places of interest.  If I ever come back to Dublin this is the only place I'll stay.",5,2013,08,14
202,Great service,"We were very pleased with our stay at the Westin, Dublin.  The service from reception, the concierge, and even the doorman helped make a good stay great.  And the most important aspects of a hotel to me are the beds, pillows and showers... which we found to be terrific.  We'll likely not return to Dublin, but wherever else we go, we'll be looking to stay at a Westin",4,2013,08,14
202,Great Location! ****,Stayed here twice over the last week... one night on arrival in Ireland and one on departure.  Very nice location to walk around the city and beds were very comfy.    Funny although we had the same room twice!   Will definitely be back and hoping for same room LOL!,5,2013,08,13
202,"Fantastic location, lovely stay","We booked in to the Westin to be close to Trinity College.  The location near Temple Bar, Grafton Street, Nassau Street book shops and restaurants, was truly fantastic.  We had a wonderful bellman help us with our bags and parked our car for us immediately.  Our rooms weren't ready yet - but we were three hours early, so we had very nice breakfasts in the beautifully decorated Atrium lounge.  Our waitress made us feel very welcome and we had delicious egg sandwiches, coffees and juices seated in the lovely red velvet sofa and armchairs near the charming horse painting.  Our hostess came up from downstairs personally to tell us our rooms were ready ahead of schedule.  Our rooms were very spacious - we had three - one for us, one for the kids, and one for our mother and sister who were traveling with us.   The beds were super comfortable, kingsize and with lovely leather headboards.  The furnishings were pretty and some copies of pages of the Book of Kells decorated the walls, and we had a nice view of Trinity. The Mint Bar was fun and the service prompt and courteous.  The gym was clean and a decent size. We would certainly stay here again.",4,2013,08,13
202,Not a Top Hotel,"The Westin, Dublin is an average city hotel. The service is partly confused but friendly- they forgot our reservation amd also the extra bed. They couldnt find our car, because the key was labeled with the wrong room number. The interiors are not very special but ok...classical, international hotel interiors. During august the hotel was very crowded. In the hallways was a strange scent of the clue of a new carpet. We wouldnt choose the hotel again.",3,2013,08,10
202,A great hotel in the center of Dublin,We stayed a night (2 rooms) in late July with my family.  The concierge and front desk were very accomidating to our needs.  The rooms are very clean and the baths are some of the best I have seen in Europe.  We did not get the chance to visit the atrium bar or restaurants but they looked comfortable and fun.  The hotel is ideally situated across the street from Trinity University and the Temple Bar area.  It's about a 30 minute cab ride from the airport.,4,2013,08,08
202,"For a Westin, the stay was very disappointing","The sole benefit of staying here is its central location - next to Trinity college and a short walk from the river Liffey and Temple Bar.  But for the price of the Westin, I'm sure you could find something else as centrally located with a friendlier staff and a more relaxing hotel experience.  First, the hotel feels like a large chain hotel (which I don't normally associate with a Westin).  There were always tons of people in the lobby and common areas and lots of people constantly coming and going.  The walls are thin as we could hear everything the guests staying in the room next to us said and did.  The first room we were assigned upon check-in smelled a combination of mold and smoke.  It was completely uninhabitable and certainly unacceptable for a hotel room costing 249 Euro a night.  We went downstairs to ask for a different room and despite it being past the time of check-in, they could not give us another room for another 2 hours (even though we were initially told that the wait for another room would be 15-20 minutes).  We were not compensated in any way, despite being ""starwood preferred members"" and, in fact, were made to feel as if we were somehow the cause of the unacceptable room conditions.  Overall, I was very disappointed by this Westin experience. I would not recommend staying here to a friend and I would certainly not stay here again.",2,2013,08,06
202,"Nice location, poor service","The location of the Westin Dublin is superb.  It is just a few minutes to Grafton Street in one direction and literally just across the street from the Temple Bar area in another direction.  There are AirCoach stops nearby as well, if you choose to take the bus from the airport to the hotel. I would give the location five stars. 

The rooms are fine as they are.  Our room was tiny for Westin standards, but the bathroom was large and clean and there were large closets to store our clothes.   This way, there was less clutter in the room, which made it at least feel a little bigger.  The clock radio was broken, so the time was always off by about 9.5 hours, and apparently it was January 4 when we stayed!  (we did try multiple times to fix the time on the machine, but the buttons didn't work...)  I would rate the sleeping rooms and bathrooms at 3.5-4. 

The reason for the low rating is the service in the hotel.  There is really a lot of room for improvement.  At check in, the staff member helping us didn't believe that our room rate included internet - which it did.   She also quoted a random upgrade rate, which didn't seem as if it was actually published anywhere.  But the service at breakfast is the real reason for the low rating here.  (perhaps if you don't get breakfast, your stay will be quite pleasant)   The breakfast staff always seemed frazzled and not very efficient in their way of handling busy times.   One woman at the restaurant check in desk was pretty snappy with customers, or maybe it was just with us.  The rest of the staff was constantly running around, even when the  dining room wasn't half full.  Alas, these are first world problems, but we are also paying good money to stay here and I do expect a level of service that most other SPG properties have.  

Our last experience with the staff was also rather poor.   As we were trying to check out, one of the staff members at the desk was ignoring guests trying to check in/out.  When we approached the desk to ask if we could check out, she replied with a curt yes, and then ignored us for another good two minutes.  Two minutes may not seem long, but imagine just standing and staring at someone for that long.  

The one staff member who was very nice was the gentleman who greets you at the door.  He was always very pleasant and helpful. 

I'm on the fence about this property.   The location is really excellent.  But the service really needs some improvement.",2,2013,08,05
202,perfect location,"right in the middle of the city center.  trinity college is on the corner, short walk to the guiness and jameson factories.  the breakfast was awesome.  the room was really nice and everything you would expect from a starwood property.",5,2013,08,05
202,Great choice at the entrance to the Temple bar,"Westin Dublin

I stayed at the hotel when I was Gold member of Starwood Preferred Guest program.
I was traveling alone on business.

It was this time of year when I have to go to Dublin again. I visit the city quite often, primarily on business, and from the hotels we are allowed to stay in, my preferences are Westin and Renaissance (The Shelbourne). The Shelbourne was fully booked for the dates I needed, so naturally I booked Westin. I reckon it's my fifth stay at the hotel.

The hotel is strategically located for access to the Temple Bar, right at the entrance from Westmoreland street and all you need to do to reach it is to cross the street. It is also 2 minutes walking distance to the Trinity college and very close to all major downtown landmarks. There is Tesco at the entrance of Temple bar if you need groceries, Starbucks 50 meters to the right if you want a coffee, and shopping of Crafton street 5 minutes away. 

The hotel's location and the fact it is housed in old building have its disadvantages that can be easily avoided shall you plan in advance.
1) it is on major bus route (these buses ARE noisy) and sometimes have a lot of police/ambulance traffic at night (guess due to proximity to Temple bar). And so it is noisy. Light sleepers therefore are highly encouraged to ask for an internal-facing room (there are several rooms that face internal atrium or internal courtyard) - they are not noisy at all. If they don't have any, ask for the room facing Fleet Street.
2) Only concierge parking is available for EUR 25. However nearest parking is 200m from the hotel inside the Temple Bar, so if savings is your goal, park there. Concierge service is reliable and always fetch the car in time if notified 15 minutes in advance.
3) Some of the streets around the hotel are bus-only for some period of time (there are large signs advertising this fact), so if you don't want to be fined, plan how you will drive there in advance. Best approach is to get to D'Olier street, turn right to College street and then turn right again to Westmoreland street. Hotel entrance will be immediately on your right. Remember there are no postcodes in Ireland so if your GPS can accept coordinates, the hotel entrance is located at N53.345571, W6.25892 - feed that to the GPS and you'll be there, guaranteed.
4) As the hotel is situated in historical building, most of the rooms have different size and shape so do not be surprised if you will be assigned something that do not look like photos at the hotel web site.. there is only one remedy against that - if you don't like the room, go down and ask to be moved. 

I contacted hotel in advance and asked for an atrium-facing room on high floor far away from elevators, and they answered promptly telling that they made a record of the request and will do their utmost to fulfil it. At the check-in they confirmed that I indeed have the room I ordered, on 4th floor, facing internal atrium. Check-in was handled expediently. I was advised that if I don't want housekeeping they will give 500 starpoints or EUR 5 beverage credit for each day housekeeping was not used. Could be quite beneficial for some however I like fresh towels so rejected.
I also asked reception to empty minibar and switch it off (noisy). This request was immediately complied with.

I believe that all atrium-facing rooms are standard rooms. My room had queen-size bed, writing desk, a lot of different closets, flat screen TV, minibar, safe and individually controlled air-conditioner.  Easy chair and journal table was sitting by the window. There was also alarm clock with iPod dock. Bathroom was all marble with walk-in shower and bath. Toiletries were standard Westin offering (white tea aloe variety).  There was a bathrobe but no slippers - call to service express fixed the issue with slippers delivered expediently.
As a welcome gesture room had a plate with chocolates, walnuts and blueberries. There were also 2 bottles water replenished daily (free). 
Overall the room was all I needed and asked for.  The only disappointment is the door that rattles each time it is closed and not really insulates from the corridor noise (the fact that room requested was as far as possible from the elevator eliminated foot traffic almost entirely but one still could hear anything that happens in the corridor). It was also quite dimly lit to the point that it was inconvenient to read in the bed with all lights in the room ""on"" - these hotels believe that fitting energy-saving bulbs of minimum brightness is enough (it is not).

Minibar prices are ""reasonable"" for luxury hotel, with spirits miniatures sold by EUR 6 and Coke etc for EUR 3. Beer in Ireland nowadays costs fortune so minibar is not an exception (EUR 6 for 0.33 bottle of Heineken). For the same price you can buy a pint of beer downstairs in the bar. I've tried a new beer they had  - Tom Crean's Premium Irish Lager and liked it. Minibar also had reasonable selection of glasses and cork opener.

Internet is EUR 15 for 24 hours, unless it is included in the room rate (mine was). When purchased, Internet is reliable however at times it is too slow for video streaming. Note that for EUR 15 you will only be able to connect up to 3 devices (I however am afraid that it is now being the rule in many hotels). 

Gym is quite small - has 2 elliptic machines, 2 bikes, 3 treadmills and some weights. It is actually quite claustrophobic as it has low ceiling, no windows and was in semi-darkness. It was also quite stuffy (but this may be attributed to the quite high outdoor temperatures). It was not busy. Machines accept Polar heart rate monitor which is quite convenient. Hotel has Westin Workout program where they can lend you gym gear (socks and running shoes for EUR 5 a stay). Gym has a toilet and a shower cabin which can be quite handy (if your room is not ready or you already checked out you can still ask to use the shower). 	

Check-in was handled expediently and there is dedicated check-in desk for Starwood elites. Check-out was also prompt. Some minibar charges managed to sneak into the bill despite the fact minibar was off and emptied, but that was promptly corrected.

Food
There are several ways one can have a breakfast - it can be had in Exchange restaurant, in Atrium lounge, through room service menu (EUR 20 for continental breakfast EUR 24 for Irish breakfast or a la carte). In my books EUR 20 for continental breakfast is highway robbery so most of the time I had my continental breakfast at the Starbucks nearby. Interestingly the full Irish breakfast in Exchange restaurant downstairs is only 19.50 with bigger choice of items so unless you want to have a breakfast in bed, going downstairs is a better option. 
The breakfast served in main restaurant have standard set of cold items (salmon, meats and cheeses), hot items (eggs, bacon, sausage, hashbrowns, mushrooms, etc), choice of cereals, bigger than usual choice of juices (including tomato juice), smoothies, pastries, fruits, yoghurts, good selection of teas and specialty coffees (espresso cappuccino etc. at no additional cost). They can also prepare eggs your way. It is also an a-la-carte option but I didn't look into that. Overall reasonable price for what it is.

There are several options for dinner as well - one can dine in Exchange restaurant (which is quite popular with hotel residents and non-residents alike and have a lot of separate reviews on tripadvisor, closed on Sunday and Monday), in the Mint bar or in the Atrium lounge (primarily serves sandwiches and salads as well as afternoon tea). Room service menu is quite varied and food quality is reasonable, especially if one orders items from the Exchange.
Then again, there are probably in excess of 100 restaurants and pubs within 1 mile radius from the hotel.

Transportation: Taxi from the airport will cost you EUR25-35 (depending whether it is weekend or not, time of day and the traffic). Aircoach bus will get you to the hotel entrance for EUR 7. 

Other amenities: Except the gym already mentioned there is also a small spa at the ground floor, and that's pretty much it - there is no SPG lounge.

Bottom line - it was very good stay, I would not mind to stay there again.  

The only disappointment was with the housekeeping. I just don't know how hard it is to check that there is one full bottle of shampoo, conditioner and shower gel each day, but it is certainly something housekeeping just can not comprehend. I know it can sound petty but I shower often and don't want housekeeping to make a judgement with regard to whether the amount left in opened bottle is ""enough"". Raising issue with reception did not change anything at first, but raising it for the second time resulted in housekeeping bringing 3x normal amount of toiletries which lasted until check-out. I need to add that it might be down to particular person's behaviour as I don't remember having this issue on past visits. 

If anyone has any questions related to this hotel I will be glad to answer (if I know the answer) - just ask.",4,2013,08,05
202,"Location, location, location","I stayed at the Westin Dublin the end of July for a week for tourism. I had a King Executive room on the outside (some rooms overlook interior courtyards I would avoid). I had a large room with a view of the Trinity College. Don't be confused, this is not some hotel in a quiet area; it is in the middle of the city and all the convenience that implies (steps away from Temple Bar, Grafton Street, O'Conell Street, etc.). If you want to avoid minibar charges (it's electronic and fooled me), there's a Tesco store almost directly across the street with much cheaper beer, sodas, and snacks. My room had no outside noise except for the sea gulls. Interior noise was pretty quiet. Room (436) was large, clean, well appointed. TV is awful unless you want to watch International news or sports (I started watching shows on my iPad). Bathroom was large with separate showers and bath; one minor complaint, I don't take baths, but bathtub was rather filthy (and bathroom was a bit dark). Otherwise bathroom was fine. Staff is very helpful and discrete. Staff responded promptly to problems (I had a problem with a shower drain). I had 2 meals at the Mint Bar in the basement; the service was prompt, friendly, the food was good, and not really more expensive than outside the hotel (and no mandatory service charge included-Dublin isn't cheap, but not really expensive). If you're a ""vegetarian"" that eats seafood, verify meal doesn't contain meat.I wouldn't hesitate to stay here in my next visit.",5,2013,08,04
202,Nice hotel in the heart of Dublin,"I always found Westin to be comfortable in terms of bedding and this one is right in the heart of Dublin close to shopping and Trinity College.  I did not think it was as good as some other Westins that I have stayed at for example in the US, Madrid or Munich. There was no pool.  I booked two rooms for my family and they tried to put us on separate floors.  I would have liked them to be more accommodating.  You have to pay for Wi-Fi and the parking is outrageous.",4,2013,08,01
202,Lovely and well situated hotel,The Westin Dublin Hotel is in the heart of the city at College Green and across the street from Fleet Street and the lively Temple Bar area.  The rooms are gorgeous and the staff are very helpful and friendly.  A nightcap at the Mint Bar with live jazz music and an award winning French Martini is highly recommended. I will definitely stay at the Westin on my next trip to Dublin.,5,2013,07,30
202,Great hotel in Dublin!,"The Westin is getting a lot of 5 star reviews, and for very good reasons.  My family (6 adults) stayed there on our trip to Ireland and we loved it!  Obviously, as you have read, the location is fantastic, but it gets better from there.  The staff was superb, very helpful, and we could always count on them to help us out.  And that's everyone, and all done with politeness and a smile.

The breakfast was excellent, and the beds were so comfortable that sleep consumed you instantly.  I've heard that the late night food room service was excellent, as well.",5,2013,07,29
202,Absolute Gem,"A haven of tranquility in the centre of Dublin. Beautiful rooms, friendly and attentive staff. We used our SPG points to book a standard room and we upgraded for just ‚Ç¨29 to a larger deluxe room with a very comfortable king bed. Great location if you need a base to visit Dublin. The Atrium lounge is a peaceful escape or the mint bar is a bit more lively.",5,2013,07,29
202,What a location,"We spent 6 nights here and thoroughly enjoyed it as a base of our Irish travels.  The Mint bar boasts of superb cocktails and the bartenders really act like top ""Mixologists"" taking much care in preparing the different drinks.  When you exit the hotel and go right you head down O'Connell St.  If you go left you go past the old parliament, Trinity University and then head through the pedestrian area surrounding Grafton Street.  A little further down is St. Stephen's Green and the surrounfing areas of Dawson Street and Lower Bagot St.  If you go across the street you head down the Temple bar area where the places are too numerous to name.",4,2013,07,28
202,Lovely hotel in great location,"The Dublin Westin is a very nice hotel in a super location.  It is ideal for tourists as it is next to Trinity College/Book of Kells, a block from Temple Bar pubs and restaurants, and two blocks from Grafton street shopping.  Our room was clean, comfortable and roomy.  The staff, while helpful and polite seemed a bit undermanned.  Concierge station often not staffed and the restaurant was closed during much of our stay.  Also, be aware that you will probably not be able to check into your room much before 3 PM.  The hotel is heavily booked and in great demand.",5,2013,07,27
202,Great Westin,"We stayed here 2 nights prior to a cruise. We were able to check in early which was much appreciated after an overnight flight. We used SPG pionts but chose to upgrade to a Writer's room for 50 euro per night. The room was very nice, a king bed and had a small balconey area. The bed was very comfortable, a nice walk in shower and nice products. The hotel is air conditioned which was a big plus as they were having a heat wave in Dublin. The area around the hotel was great, all sorts of eating, drinking and shopping. 
Would defientely return to this property in the future. ",5,2013,07,27
202,Love this hotel!!!,"Excellent location, restful rooms, but the best is the staff. The jovial door man, the efficient and intelligent desk clerk. The best was the concierge that got us reservations at a Michelin star restaurant that was BOOKED, for 6, with 1 day notice!!! It was excellent.",5,2013,07,26
202,Standard Stay,"My stay was for 7 nights for a work-related trip. This Westin is centrally located to restaurants, shopping, and transportation. It has a very traditional feel, common to many Westin properties that I've stayed at but lacking the modern-ness that I feel it should have at this day and age. It is your very classic style, probably refurbished back some time around 2006.

I was given a room with two twin beds - they could not accommodate me with a queen or king bed. But, at least the bed was a Heavenly bed and was pretty comfortable. The bathroom was pretty sizeable though with a separate shower and tub. And the room was also pretty spacious.The property was kept very clean and I had a room on the same floor as the Fitness Center - very convenient. I did not have a great view so you may want to ask for a room that has a better one.

I also had dinner in their restaurant; very expensive so beware. Overall, the stay was decent but I would not say that it exceeded any expectations. Too bad as I am a Gold SPG member.",3,2013,07,25
202,Beautiful but waiting to see if bill will be corrected,"This was a fantastic hotel.  Very much a five star and thanks to Maggie at the front desk for her service.  The room was beautiful. Photos on their website are accurate. I asked for a room away from the street and we were very graciously accommodated.

We were scheduled to spend two nights at the Westin before leaving Dublin, but had a small crisis with flights and could only stay one day Saturday, July 20. Two days were paid in full back in May through hotels.com. 

 I am seeing pending charges on my credit card.  If anything, I should be getting a refund for the 2nd night.  We were well within the 24 hour notice period.  Soooo, my rating right now is a five star BUT that will be changed rapidly if my charges do not get rectified.
If Westin is reading this...look for Pat and Bob J.",5,2013,07,25
202,Our first stop in Ireland,"My wife and I were spending 7 days touring Ireland and our first stop was the Westin Dublin for a one night stay.  We had a pleasant experience at this hotel starting with the doorman assisting us with our luggage and car.  The hotel is in a great location and convenient to attractions, shopping and food.  We found the staff to be very friendly and the accommodations inviting.  We appreciated getting into our room early since we had just got off the plane from the US.  Our experience at this hotel was a great start to our trip.",5,2013,07,23
202,"Fantastic location, excellent staff","The location for this property couldn't be any better.  Located across the street from the Bank of Ireland, Trinity College, and Temple Bar.  The staff was very friendly and accommodating. If the weather is nice, enjoy a drink out on the sidewalk bar and watch the people walk by.  Very close to the river as well where you can find some fantastic food.",4,2013,07,22
202,"Perfect location, fantastic service!","My husband and I stayed here while we visited Dublin.  This hotel is within walking distance of everything you want to do/see as a tourist!  The room was large, clean, and very nice.  The bed was comfy, the bathroom was huge, and the shower was great.  On a Saturday night we were having difficulty making dinner reservations and the concierge was able to get us a last minute reservation at one of Dublin's best restaurants.",5,2013,07,22
202,Perfect location!  Great hotel!,"You could not get a more perfect location for exploring Dublin.  The Westin is right across the street from Trinity College, a short walk to Grafton St and Temple Bar, and very near the hop-on, hop-off sightseeing bus.  The room was like a typical U.S. Westin Hotel...very nice, comfortable, tasteful, air conditioned (which was a huge factor when we were there during a record heat wave). We had beers in the bar in the lower level...I can't recommend any of the food we tried,  but service was very good and it's a nice comfortable place for an after-sightseeing drink.  
Staff throughout were extremely polite and accommodating.",5,2013,07,21
202,Would be a 3-4 star hotel in the States with 4-5 star service,"GREAT LOCATION! 

The rooms are clean, king bed a true king and comfy, toiletries good to excellent...everything worked well. A little pricey for an average room, but boy does the service make up for it! 

In room breakfast instead of going downstairs only a small fee for delivery...excellent! Must have the FULL Irish breakfast.

The service at the desk and at the curb, A++. We stayed on June 26th, 29th and 30th. The young lady (early 20s, specialized in ""shopping"" on her name tag, dark hair and wonderful personality) at the front desk at check in...she needs a raise. She is the only person our whole 11 day trip that came from behind the counter, wrote on our map recommendations, and was spot on what we were looking for. Wish I could remember her name.

The service is wonderful, worth every dime. The staff gave us cakes and a hand written card thanking us for staying during our honeymoon. The door man our last two nights was my favorite, opening all the doors for me, holding an umbrella to keep me out of the rain, and dressed so handsomely. 

You will really enjoy your stay here.",5,2013,07,19
202,"Nice hotel, central location","I stayed here for 2 nights in February with a friend.  We got the hotel with our company rates which made it quite economical (normal rates seem a bit high).  I upgraded my room and ended up with a large bedroom/bathroom.  The bed was comfy, the shower great.  The staff in the hotel was very nice.  The location is very central.  I didn't eat in the hotel so I can't comment on their food.

We went to the Mint Bar twice for drinks.  The bar was lovely but the staff was horrible.  They were extremely slow and never came back to check on us.  We had to hunt them down anytime we wanted service.  It wasn't even that busy.  It's a good thing that they don't rely on tips because I wouldn't have left one.",4,2013,07,19
202,Great stay,"This hotel was good!  Great location, easy to get to via public transportation, close to sites and spacious rooms.  Would definitely stay here again!

The room was clean and had very comfortable beds.  The robes were nice.

The gym was a great.  The check in and out was very fast. And the service was wonderful - they recommended good restaurants and booked a cab for us.",5,2013,07,18
202,"Great hotel, great location","We stayed here for just one night with a family of 5. (We did have to get 2 rooms, as they did not have rooms big enough to fit all 5 of us.) We arrived VERY early after an overnight flight and the staff at the reception desk did their best to get us into our rooms as early as possible. By 9:00 am we were situated in both rooms. The hotel is in the heart of Dublin ~ you can walk everywhere. It was clean, convenient and I found the staff helpful and friendly. We also had the concierge arrange for a car service to pick us up when we arrived in Dublin and that worked out very well. Just email the concierge ahead of time with your flight info and he/she takes care of it for you and they just add the charge to your room.",5,2013,07,15
202,Perfect location and perfect nights sleep,"The Westin lived up to my expectations by far. We are a family of 4 so I rented two rooms.  My wife and I booked a suite and were very pleased with it's spaciousness.  My sons room was very nice as well, the hotel upgrading their room to a deluxe.  The beds were massively comfortable.  The morning breakfast was awesome.  I had 2 rooms and since I was platinum the front desk provided only my room with passes for breakfast, which was odd aince i rented two rooms.  However the staff in the resturaunt was generous and gave passes for the other room.  Hurray! If I come to Dublin again I will be coming back!",5,2013,07,15
202,Missing something,"The location is great, rooms are okay.  At check in everything seems off- may need more experienced staff or really better management.  We had an issue with service- towels/phone/ room service the first part of our trip. I had a conversation with a reception person who did try and correct the situation for our return 2 nights.  The return was better- mainly because we knew what to expect.  The gym - not so great and missing the little amenities- apples, towels.  Starwood should look into this hotel. The doorman Peter was great, and the Mint Bar was fun- just missing management. Learn from the Fitzwilliam Hotel  in Belfast.",4,2013,07,14
202,It is good hotel but missing attention to platinum spg,"well, I can't say it is bad hotel but it is just missing that extra attention to platinum SPG members that are obviously the most loyal to the brand. Apparently they tried to give us (3 of us) suite as an upgrade but we actually never got one (it was not so convincing that they even were honest about it). Location of the hotel is just perfect, can't be more central, breakfast was not bad but nothing exceptional. The staff in general was very friendly and attentive. 
So in general we get much more extra as platinum SPG in other hotels everywhere else, that's all.",4,2013,07,13
202,Standard Business Hotel with Great Location,"Hands down, this hotel has one of the best locations in Dublin.  It is steps away from all the major tourist destinations and a block away from the airport bus stop (bus #747).  If you want to be in the middle of everything, then this may be your hotel.

We arrived early and we were instantly met with a warm welcome.  We were notified that our room was not available yet, but they stored our bags and took them up to our room when it was ready.

We are Starwood gold members, but no upgrade or extras were provided other than the standard ""free internet"" amenity (selected from a short list of options).  The room was really small (one of the smallest on the floor from looking at the fire escape map on the door) but the bathroom was large and modern.  The bed was so saggy we felt like we were sleeping on the floor.  Not sure why the bed was so ""soft"", but it certainly wasn't what we've come to expect a hotel brand that regularly promotes the comfort of their beds.

I suppose our expectations were probably pretty high given this hotels's TripAdvisor reviews, but in reality we found a pretty standard hotel with somewhat uncomfortable beds.  We had a second night planned on our way back through Dublin, but stayed elsewhere instead.  It's not that we didn't enjoy our stay at the Westin -- but there are lots of other options that cost less and have comfier beds.  Note to hotel staff: please invest in some standard ""Heavenly Beds"" and we'll stay again in a heartbeat.",4,2013,07,11
202,Beautiful hotel in a friendly city,We stayed at the Westin on 6/29 and 6/30. The rooms were clean and comfortable. It is in a great location. The breakfast buffet was very good. We really enjoyed the the Mint bar. Everyone was very friendly and nice. The only down side was you had to pay for internet.,4,2013,07,11
202,Such a great stay at The Westin Dublin,"The location of this hotel is right in the middle of everything! You can easily walk to the temple bar area, grafton street, st stephens green, trinity college, etc. you won't be disappointed by choosing this location! The staff there did an exceptional job, we received two free waters everyday and that was very nice touch considering how much water we both drink. I can't say enough positive things about this place, great ambiance, friendly staff, and clean!",5,2013,07,11
202,Can walk everywhere - between Trinity College and Temple Bar,"First of all the Air coach drops off and picks up very close to the hotel - which is extremely convenient.

Excellent staff - front desk, doormen, concierge, restaurant - no complaints at all!  Everyone was very helpful, polite and attentive.  We stayed there twice during our ten day trip to Ireland.  Breakfast buffet (included for us) had a very nice variety and they would make lattes/cappuccinos for you upon request.  They even had fruit smoothies on the buffet.

We were upgraded both times to two room suites - lovely and spacious.  The bathrooms are massive with great showers.  Also, some rooms face an interior atrium while others face the street.",4,2013,07,09

202,"Nice, clean hotel","Good location and helpful staff.  The rooms were on the small side, but comfortable and clean.  Good location downtown.  I liked the different areas that you could hang out.  The continental breakfast was excellent.  Dinner at the hotel was okay.  My chicken was dry.  The thing that really bugged me was that you couldn't get wifi in your room without paying an arm and a leg for it.  You had to hang out in the lobby to use it.",4,2013,07,08
202,Lovely,My brother and I stayed here on points for our first trip to Europe. The staff was helpful. Our room had a great view of Fleet Street. It is walking distance to everything any tourist wants to see in Dublin. The gym is fantastic. Our room was clean and comfortable. The tea room was great as well as the breakfast. Front desk service was polite and helpful. There are computers available for guests to use and a concierge who will book tickets for you and give you great tips. The front desk will coordinate taxis for you. I wouldn't stay any where else in Dublin.,5,2013,07,08
202,Perfect location!!,"This is a beautiful Westin in a great location!! The hotel is a typical high end Westin, very classy. The staff is exceptional, we especially enjoyed Peter helping us in our car every day, he is precious!! Location is perfect for walking to local restaurants and shops. Loved it!!",5,2013,07,08
202,Fantastic hotel,"Beautiful hotel in the heart of the city - short walk from Temple Bar.
We had a fantastic room, no complaints at all.
Food excellent too.
Only downside was the 200 euros I had to pay as security (we were there for 4 nights - 50 euros/night) - I thought that was an awful lot to pay, but obviously received this back at the end of our stay.
Highly recommended.",5,2013,07,05
202,Great location. Friendly staff. Several westin touches missing,"Good hotel. Good service. Great beds. Very clean.
Some services lacking. Not needing to go into detail.
After staying in Athens and Madrid, this hotel needs a little push to make it excellent as it should be. Staff needs more direction, although they were very friendly. 
I would definitely recommend this hotel.",4,2013,07,02
202,Check your bill but otherwise great!,"Our stay started off on a sour note when we were told the price for our rooms were literally twice what we had been quoted. Thankfully my wife noticed and had a print out of our reservation. The hotel then fixed things but still. Twice the quoted price? 

Our room was great, clean and spacious. But the best thing about the hotel is the location. It is in the middle of Dublin and we had an awesome time walking the whole city. 

The only downside is that the walls are not very sound proof. Any time anyone had a phone ring or even had a normal conversation we were privy to it. Thankfully our neighbors were very quiet but this easily could have been a disaster. ",4,2013,07,01
202,"Great service, location, and rooms but it is pricey!","This hotel is in a perfect location and just perfect service.  We really enjoyed it.  The only downside was breakfast which wasn't included in our rate and we ordered eggs benedicte a la carte and they were just so so.  There wasn't really a ""kids program"".  There was just a list of activities to do in Dublin and that is it.  It is very pricey for Ireland standards.",5,2013,06,30
202,Central Location in Historic Dublin,"This is a first class hotel located a short distance from Trinity College and all of the attractions of O'Connell and Grafton Streets.

Our room was spacious, extremely quiet and  well provisioned and the large bathroom was just great for two women travelling.

 The beds were soooooo comfortable and after our long trip were a joy to sink into.

Breakfast was one of the best we have had anywhere with a vast array of choices and great service.

We had dinner in the The Exchange Restaurant on a couple of occasions when we arrived back from our tours late in the day and didn't wish to go out again, the food was excellent and the wine list was well priced and reasonably extensive.

The Atrium Lounge was a welcome respite for a glass of Prosecco after a day's touring with its comfortable lounges and lovely decor and we had both a quick lunch and a late dinner in the Mint Bar.

However I think that one of best features of this lovely hotel is the staff; they are wonderful, helpful in the extreme, efficient and professional.

We had a total of nine days at the Westin in late May and early June and cannot recommend it highly enough.",5,2013,06,25
202,Good Location,"Very nice hotel. I am a gold Spg member & had a wonderful suite. My granddaughters had a great queen room. Picked the hotel based upon points, but would pay to stay. It is in a perfect location, next to Trinity college and an easy walk around Dublin.
The buffet breakfast could use some improvement. Not very much selection & out of a lot at 9. 
Overall a good place to stay.",4,2013,06,24
202,Best Westin?,"This excellently located hotel has some great features; afternoon tea in the atrium and very good service and drinks in The Mint Bar.  Breakfast was also good. However the high level  of room occupancy meant slow service and dirty tables at this meal. On our first full day there, our room had not been cleaned by 2pm.on Sunday 3pm arrived and still the room was not cleaned.  The floor supervisor blamed the large number of guests, but after all, it is a hotel.  Surely one  expects guests??More staff might lessen the profit margin but would improve us toner experience.
Outstanding feature in this hotel , however, were the staff.  Faultlessly trained and professional.",4,2013,06,24
202,Wonderful,"We stayed eight nights at the Westin Dublin. It is a wonderful hotel. The staff is very friendly, and the concierge service very helpful. The concierge arranged three tours for us.  The location of the hotel is excellent. You can walk to lots of places.We had a room on the 4th floor, and it was extremely quiet.  The bathroom was spacious, and so was the room. The beds were very comfortable.We had the breakfast plan, and the food was very good. Two mornings, we had breakfast in the room as we had to leave very early for tours.  We also ate lunch in the Atrium Lounge, and also had two late night dinners in the Mint Bar-all very good. We definitely would stay at the Westin again!",5,2013,06,23
202,So Nice,"We truly enjoyed our stay. Our room was beautiful and quite comfortable. The entire staff were so good natured and welcoming. It was a joy from  beginning to end.

The hotel is situated right in the heart of Dublin. We walked to every sight and restaurant we had planned to see - never needed any transportation. Our stay at the Westin enabled us to have a perfect vacation.",5,2013,06,22
202,Great location,"The staff were fantastic.  Their breakfast was beautiful.  The only setback was that wifi wasn't included in the room price.  Given that just about everywhere else in Dublin offers it free, to include the bus, was a little disappointing.",4,2013,06,22
202,Wonderful - but no Internet,"Brilliantly central, superb staff, very comfortable rooms and beds and thoroughly welcoming.
So why still no free Internet access in the rooms?
This is routine in most of Europe and was the only irritation here - get with the program Westin!",4,2013,06,22
202,Great staff!,"The staff at The Westin in Dublin is terrific.  Particularly, Jacqueline who is the front office manager.  She is incredibly attentive and accomodating.  Made our three day visit very comfortable.  The Westin has excellent location too.",5,2013,06,21
202,Best in town!!!,"What can I say... It never let me down... The staff has arranged to give me a second night at the same price of the first and a free upgrade to a Suite!!!!...outstanding !!the breakfast restauant is also great, shame they never get on how to make an egg white omelette ....:-)",5,2013,06,21
202,"Horrible 3 nights of sleep, but awsome customer service!","I stayed at the Dublin Westin for three nights while on vacation with my wife.  I originally reviewed the hotel as horrible.  We slept horrible and the bed was definitely not heavenly.  The morning of our last day, I pulled the sheets to find that a board had been placed between the mattress and box springs.  So the entire time my wife and I had literally been sleeping on a board.  We were very upset, and thought the hotel was just trying to save money by not replacing the mattress set.  I later complained using one of the email surveys that hotels send you.  Within the hour of me submitting the survey, the assistant manager of the hotel attempted to call me and sent an email.  She expressed her deepest apologies and credited my Starwood account points back, as we had stayed on points while there.  She later wrote that the previous person that stayed in the room had requested a firm mattress, so that is why the board was there.

Ultimately the customer service at the hotel was stellar as expected at a Westin.  Even though we left the hotel less rested than when we got there, our faith has been restored in the Westin brand.  We are faithful patrons and will continue to frequent their hotels.

I would still recommend staying at the Westin Dublin, just check to make sure your bed isn't altered first.  The location and staff are exceptional!",4,2013,06,20
202,Great location,"We stayed here for one night using our SPG points.  We were traveling with our son and his wife.  The hotel is centrally located and a very beautiful property.  Check in was quick and efficient.  Being that my son has status with Starwood, he gets a 4pm check out.  We hauled our bags to his room in the morning and left for the day to see the city.  Much to our dismay, upon returning at 2pm, the hotel had cleaned out his room and locked us out.  Our bags were all removed.  We felt very violated and although all of our things were still there, we never would have left our valuables out in the open had we known this would happen.  Otherwise, it was a great place to stay.",4,2013,06,19
202,Small Rooms but in the middle of everything,The hotel is right across the street from Temple Bar and from Trinity College so the location could not be better for sightseeing.  The rooms were pretty small-- barely enough room to put our suitcases down and still be able to walk around but the rooms was clean and comfortable.,4,2013,06,19
202,Wonderful staff,"The Westin Dublin is ideally located for a visit to the city centre but it is really the staff that makes it stand out.  From the doorman who greeted us as we pulled up (after a tension filled drive from the airport as we adjusted to the left side of the road) to the front desk personnel, to the server and bartender in the Atrium Lounge, every Westin employee we dealt with was friendly and helpful.  We stayed in the Oscar Wilde suite which was a treat with the spiral staircase to the loft desk area.  The hotel is within walking distance or a short taxi ride to all of the major tourist attractions in Dublin and was a perfect home base.  Afternoon tea in the Atrium Lounge was lovely and reasonably priced.  Internet connection was fast and consistent.",5,2013,06,18
202,Great place to stay in Dublin,"This is our third stay at the Westin. And we'll be back. This is a professionally run hotel. The staff is attentive. The front desk is efficient. They acknowledged us as SPG members and treated us accordingly. The rooms are the best-spacious, comfortable. Heavenly Bed and all. They appear to have updated the hotel recently especially the carpeting and corridors. Great job. And enjoying an Irish coffee in the Atrium Lounge has become our habit. So relaxing and enjoyable.",5,2013,06,17
202,A Good Surprise,"What took me to Dublin, of course, it was James Joyce. My son in law booked this hotel, of which I knew nothing... First surprise: to be in the heart os the ""City of Writers"". At a walking distance of everything. Second surprise: a wonderful staff. Third: glorious breakfast. Fourth: superbe ""conci√©rgerie""...",5,2013,06,17
202,"Excellent service, great rooms and great location","Got a wonderful upgrade due to my Starwood status. This is an excellent hotel just across the street  from Temple Bar. Walk everywhere. Suite was stunning, service perfect. Can't imagine a nicer hotel in Dublin.",5,2013,06,16
202,Another Great Stay at a Superb Hotel,"Our annual stay at the Westin Dublin proved once again why this is our favorite hotel in the world. Luxury, cleanliness, elegance, attention to detail . . . this hotel has it all. It's difficult to pamper guests while not coming off as stuffy, but the Westin staff manages to do just that. The rooms are beautifully appointed, the bathrooms luxurious, the staff friendly and professional, the atmosphere casual. And of course the location is perfect. No wonder we never consider staying anywhere else when in Dublin.",5,2013,06,14
202,Great Hotel,"We just arrived back from a 4 night stay at the Westin Dublin.  The hotel was great.  Perfect location to everything, extremely friendly staff, and very clean and comfortable rooms.  The rooms are small, but it is what you would expect with any European hotel. The workout room was recently updated and all common areas have free wifi, which was enough for us to be able to check email at least once a day.  I would definitely recommend this to anyone visiting Dublin!",5,2013,06,13
202,Very nice,"The hotel is centrally located next to Trinity College, offers good rooms for affordable prices. The service is perfect, for example sportswear for the gym and very helpful and friendly staff. Breakfast is very good.",4,2013,06,12
202,Great Hotel,"This hotel was absolutely a phenomenal stay. The staff were very courteous. The rooms were spectacular. Incredibly well maintained and decorated with, huge shock here, air conditioning!! As we traveled to Ireland during an odd heat wave (75 Fahrenheit, which is unthinkable for the Irish) it was so nice to have a cool room to come back to after an afternoon walking the streets. The location is absolutely perfect. It's on the south side of the Liffey within a 5 minutes walk from Grafton Street, Temple Bar area and Trinity College. I would highly recommend this accommodation to anyone looking to tour around Dublin!",5,2013,06,12
202,An absolute incredible stay,"We are just back from an amazing one night stay at The Westin Dublin.  From the second we arrived everything was taken care of.  The concierge was very welcoming & promptly took our car for valet parking. Check in was quick & everything was explained to us in an extremely friendly manner. As I had mentioned weeks previously on the hotels Facebook page that I was celebrating my birthday we were upgraded to my surprise & given a suite with a terrace.On entering our room there was a small birthday cake & a card from Jane Gogarty,  we were so impressed by the personal touch.  The spectacular views from our balcony of Dublin city were breathtaking & the hotel is in a perfect location for all of the cities major attractions. Dinner in the exchange restaurant was to die for & the very pleasant staff couldn't do enough for us,  equally the breakfast the following morning was superb.Our stay was flawless, even if I was to nitpick I couldn't find one thing to complain about. I would wholeheartedly recommend The Westin Dublin & look forward to our return in the not so distant future,  top class. ",5,2013,06,09
202,"The best location, extremely comfortable.","Our third visit to the Westin in Dublin was great as usual. The location is really perfect situated right between O'Connell street and Grafton street which are the main shopping streets and right beside Trinity University which has the book of Kells and right across the street from Temple Bar. The rooms are reasonably spacious for a city centre luxury hotel and are extremely comfortable and clean. The beds are so comfortable, which makes it difficult to get up in the morning. The bathrooms are huge with a massive standing shower and separate bathtub. There is a great atmosphere in the hotel. The only drawback is wifi is not free in the bedrooms, but it is free if you sit in the lobby on one of the many comfortable couches. The staff are what really makes this hotel fantastic, extremely friendly and helpful. We were helped check in at the front desk by Nicola who even though she was in training was very friendly, nice and made us feel very welcome and provided exceptional customer service. We will definitely be returning.",5,2013,06,07
202,Great Hotel,"I spent a week at the Westin for a business trip. The Westin is a lovely hotel. Best location for staying in Dublin. The staff was very friendly. The Atrium Bar is my favorite. Close to Grafton Street, Temple Bar, Abbey Theatre, Trinity College.",5,2013,06,06
202,Drinking in Dublin,"Great location, over looks trinity college. The view from the room overlooks the school. The hotel is Just around the corner from the temple Bar and Grafton street area's ""Two of the best pub area's in the world"". The Mint Bar in the basement gives the outside bars a run for their money.",5,2013,06,05
202,Great Place in Dublin,"A little late writting this review. It has been a little while since we stayed here. But I wanted to say it was a great experience at this hotel. Room was very nice, clean and quiet. It was a great location to base out of to walk around and explore or ride the hop o hop off bus around the city. The staff was very friendly and helpful. I will stay here again if I get back to Dublin.",5,2013,06,05
202,Perfect afternoon tea,"I'm a little late with this review. I booked afternoon tea for a friends birthday here & we weren't disappointed. There is a really nice atmosphere in the atrium as the ceilings are very high so it's not loud and you don't get that crowded feeling that you might get in more intimate settings.
We loved our afternoon at experience.
We will be back definitely",5,2013,06,04
202,The perfect location.,"Not only is the Westin perfectly situated, it also provides lovely rooms and excellent service.  From the doorman to the reception desk to the bellhops, the service was faultless and always so friendly.  The Atrium was perfect for a drink or snack and served a lovely afternoon tea.  I would highly recommend the Westin for any trip to Dublin.",5,2013,05,31
202,A fine stay in Dublin,"We stayed at the hotel  on May 11th and 12th.  It was our first trip outside the USA and we found the hotel and its staff to be just wonderful.  Our room was not ready, but our luggage was stored and taken to our room in the afternoon, which was wonderful   This allowed us to make the most of our first day.
  Our quiet room had a beautiful bathroom with a separate shower. Our window looked  out over the rooftops of Dublin.  The staff was friendly and helpful, especially  the concierge , Kevin, I  think. We ate our first dinner in the Mint pub downstairs and it was very good.  Our waitress  was very friendly and helpful.  She made a special plate of fish and chips for our teenage daughter who was recovering from jet lag and not up to leaving our room.   The buffet breakfast in the dining room was excellent tool.
  Our location was just great .  We could walk to everything,Trinity College, Temple Bar. 
Grafton St. as well as St. Stephen's Green. 
  Our only disappointment  was that we hat to pay for wi-fi by the hour in our room.
We also forgot two LL BEAN fleece  jackets in our closet and no effort was made to send them to us.
  This hotel is lovely and in a terrific location , but it is rather  expensive.",5,2013,05,30
202,Perfect location to explore Dublin,"We were surprised to find this Hotel after driving past it several times. Hotels in Ireland do not have large signs or street numbers as in North America. This place was worth the search. Stayed here our first and last night in Ireland. After Valet parking we walked around for two hours, Grafton Street, a pedestrian's haven. Tons of worthy pubs, restaurants and shops all within walking distance. St Stephens Park and Trinity college worth mentioning. Only had breakfast here both days. Great meal to start the day!",5,2013,05,28
202,A kid's delight!,"I've had several great stays at this hotel but this was the first time I've stayed with my 3 children (aged 5, 2 and 4 months). The staff were extremely accommodating, providing a cot, 2 airbeds, high-chair, change mat, kid's bath mat and toys! The kids in-room picnic was amazing with so much food served in a real picnic basket! We can't wait to stay again!",5,2013,05,28
202,Westin Comfort in a central Dublin location,"The hotel was a great comfort after a week of traveling throughout the country and staying in lovely, but older castles and manor houses.  The Heavenly Bed was just the ticket for a great night's sleep.  The staff is excellent and the location is  outstanding - adjacent to Trinity College and Fleet Street. Excellent dining, touring and shopping options are within walking distance.",4,2013,05,27
202,Charming staff,"I stayed for one night before flying out on a long haul trip. The staff were, without exception, pleasant and helpful. I had a problem confirming my airport transfer and Lazlo on the concierge desk took control, made all the calls and sorted the problem out.

My room was upgraded to a 'library suite' and I was delighted with the split level and the spiral staircase. The comment I would make about the room is that there is, unusually, no telephone handset in the bathroom - inevitably, people called when I was 'indisposed'!

Sunday is not a great day to be wanting dinner in Dublin and it does not help that the main restaurant is closed on Sunday and Monday. The room service menu is better than either of the other dining options.",4,2013,05,27
202,Amazing! I loved every minute,"From the second I walked in, to the time I left I felt taken care of.
The friendliness of the staff was excellent. 
The man who checked me in remembered my name the next day when he passed me in the hall which has never happened in all my years of staying in hotels.
The quality of the rooms were amazing and the food in the restaurant was some of the best I've ever had.
I can't wait to go back again.",5,2013,05,27
202,Classic,"Right in the center of town it seems.   Clearly an upscale property.  Desk personnel were warm and attentive.  The room was an upgrade - a suite with the bedroom space on the first level, and an office space up a spiral staircase.   The bathroom was modern and clean - with a formal shower and tub.   Even a towel rack to dry the towel after use - something I find surprisingly rarely in many hotels.   Ample electric outlets too.  Minor gripes - the coffee in the room was a truly mediocre brand - surprising for the quality of the property - But the real milk was a plus.   Plus - the late night food menu is pretty minimal - late night eating is not a Dublin thing I've learned.   And there were almost no trash cans - just one in the bathroom.   However - these are minor - there was much to appreciate and I'd hope to return.",5,2013,05,26
202,Not up to Starwood standards,We stayed at the Westin Dublin for four nights and the location is great.  The double room that was allotted to us was very small with only one bedside table and not even a light on the other side of the bed. The next morning we complained  and were moved into another room which was much better.  In both rooms there were no hotel booklets indicating breakfast hours etc.... No slippers . The towels were slightly larger than a hand towel and although we were a couple only one shower gel was provided. The tissues were never replinished but two tissues were placed over the emply box each morning. In the mini bar there were no snacks.  We have stayed in Starwood hotels all over the globe and this hotel left us disappointed.,3,2013,05,26
202,Very Nice,"I thought that the staff was very friendly, especially the doorman. He was great!They have a nice mezzanine area for food with very pretty flowers. 

They also had a really nice weight room. If you're just trying to work out in the morning, its perfect!",5,2013,05,24
202,This place earned my love with a super early check-in,"This hotel has all the great amenities you'd expect from a Westin... clean, well appointed rooms, hot and high pressure showers, nice staff, etc. There are two major items that made this hotel go from ""good"" to ""great"" in my estimation.

1. This hotel let my husband and I check in at 6am after a really long red-eye flight. Being able to set down our bags, take a shower, and rest for a bit really saved the day. I found this to be exceptional customer service.

2. This hotel is in central Dublin, and under a 5 minutes walk from most of the major attractions. Being able to stop in as we toured the city to freshen up was wonderful.

My understanding is that this hotel is quite expensive, however we were able to book rooms bundled with our airline tickets that worked out to be about $100 a night.",5,2013,05,23
202,Best Location,My wife and I were impressed even beyond our expectations with the location and quality of the facility ... turn right and its Temple Bar ... turn left - Grafton Street and Trinty College. Can't imagine staying anywhere esle in Dublin.,5,2013,05,23
202,Why fi?,"Gorgeous building, location in Dublin is PRIME. Concierge very helpful, reception extremely attentive and friendly. Our receptionist's name escapes us due to her badge stating her passion which is a lot more amazing than just learning a name. ""Shopping"" was hers, and she deserves a payrise for her said passion as she was just amazing. 

The hotel is luxe in many respects but having to pay for wifi as a guest in a deluxe room? Really? I've known than flat rate hotels are famous for add on prices and services but was very disappointed that we lacked a basic amenity. 

To end on a hight note - 5* beds, room was amazing and that receptionist is an asset. And our Beyonc√© concert was amazeballs! ;-)",4,2013,05,22
202,"Excellent Place, Location and Service!","I stayed at the Westin Dublin from 10/MAY/13 to 13/MAY/13. I have traveled a lot around the world already, and I can tell this was one of the best experiences I had!
The suite was gorgeous with a lot of space including a very well decorated living area.
The location is also one of the high points at this hotel, just a few steps from Grafton Street, Trinity College and Temple Bar.
The staff was very pleasant during all my stay!
I definitely recommend this hotel.",5,2013,05,21
202,"Great location, disappointing stay","This was more like the standard you'd expect from a mediocre 3*hotel.  Staff were very average, nothing out of the ordinary, customer service bland at best.  The room was very basic, no nice little extra touches at all - no biccies with the tea/coffee, no turn down service and no surprise choc on your pillow either! Cocktails were lovely, but very expensive, and again, staff were reluctant to engage more than they had to - indeed when two bugs were found floating in our drink, we had to suggest to the batman that perhaps our replacement drink should be complimentary - latte was lovely though. Check in and check out we're very slow, and car parking extortionate.  We stayed for our anniversary and told the staff when booking, but still ended up with twin beds! We won't be back! Ps didn't appreciate paying for our paper either!",2,2013,05,18
202,Beautiful Hotel in a Great Location,This hotel must have undergone a recent remodel.  It was very fresh and the staff was very helpful.  We stayed in an author Suite and it was very fun.  You could not ask for a better location.  You are close to so much!,5,2013,05,15
202,"EXCELLENT HOTEL, LOCATION AND STAFF!","This is a great hotel in the perfect location. All the ladies at the reception were all wonderful--especially Laura Farrington who checked me in. Also, Luwen Zhou the manager, was terrific during my entire stay. The hotel is in a great location--close to Temple Bar area, Trinity College, River Liffey and the hop-on-hop-off buses, which is a great way to see the sites. Also, there are plenty of bars, restaurants and places to shop directly across the street! The suite was clean, the beds are incredibly comfortable and it is a great place. Let me add, my daughter's are studying in Florence and they went to Dublin for the Weekend and they had no idea I got there early to surprise them. They had no idea I flew in for the weekend and Luwen was kind enough to videotape their reaction when I surprised them and it was a great moment. Thanks to Luwen we have that special moment on tape and we can't thank her enough for that! This is the best place to stay in Dublin!",5,2013,05,14
202,Afternoon Tea....how quaint,"Visited here recently for Afternoon Tea, with a difference.  You can have the traditional Afternoon Tea or the Hendricks Afternoon Tea which by the name would suggest that Hendricks Gin is involved.  The teapot consists of a Gin bases Mojito however I asked for a traditional Mojito and this was no problem.  The staff were perfectly courteous without being imposing.  The food element of the afternoon tea consisted of a number of savoury items along with many sweet items to follow - the menu for this can be sourced on the Hotel's website.

This is a quirky way to spend a Saturday afternoon and a lovely gift for someone - go, you'll love it if you like the nice things in life.",4,2013,05,12
202,Excellent service.,The room was clean and bright.  Shower was great.  The concierge was friendly and eager to help.   The doorman actually walked my mother across the street.   Location is walking distance to many of the Dublin attractions as well as the tram.   Would stay here again when in Dublin.  ,5,2013,05,11
202,Very friendly staff!,"The Westin hotel is very good located. U r juist minutes away from big shoppingmalls, museums, Trinity College. Amazing St. Stephen Greens park is couple of minutes away and u can take from there the tourbus. In the hotel u can have a great breakfast, lunch en dinner. Rooms are goed sized and bathroom is big, we had room on the 4th floor.  Hotel staff is very vriendly and kind and always glad to help u. Hotel is located in very beatiful building. Next time I am in Dublin I would only stay in The Westin hotel.",5,2013,05,11
202,It was not everything I expected,"Location beats any other hotel.  Closed to Grafton St, and Temple Bar area as well as museums and other attractions.  Great restaurants, small and larger sizes to pick and choose.

Room are nice, comfortable but it depends where you are located.  You could have street or wall view.  Noise can be an issue.  Amenities are a hit or miss.  Coffee supply could me missing sugar one day or dairy the next and there is a bit of a wait when you call for replenishment.

The customer service could certainly improve, it can be somber, somewhat mechanic.  

I went on the bus tour and have to say that I love it.  Very informative and the driver was very funny.  

Shopping and night life was good and at the bars is where you find the locals and the true Irish wit.",3,2013,05,11
202,Could do better,"If there was a rating for just 'good' I would use it for the Westin. It has a lot going for it - the position is excellent and the staff are generally friendly and responsive, albeit with the feel of large corporate customer service training. The (deluxe 5th floor) room was a good size and the Mint bar - and Michael in particular - was a great, if pricey, experience.
I think a combination of high expectations and a series of small niggles just knocked the shine off: I am sure the website said all deluxe rooms had a street view, but this one looked out on an internal wall, not even the atrium, and did not appear to have opening windows; there were no milks with the tea and coffee making facilities and it took 2 calls to reception and a gap of 2-3 hours before these were delivered; I took the eco/green option at check-in but this seemed to mean that nothing was stocked up throughout my stay, so I had to call reception each time for teabags etc; and so on.
Given its position in the City, this hotel should be a knockout, and I think with a bit more luck it would easily warrant a 4th star, but the smaller chains are just getting these things right first time these days so I cannot bring myself to recommend the Westin.",3,2013,05,10
202,Best location in Dublin,"The Westin Dublin was one of the most enjoyable properties we've stayed at in a while.  Its location seems to be its big selling point, just a literal stone's throw from Trinit College, Grafton St. and the Temple Bar area.  Also the museums and libraries.  For anyone literary-minded, the Chester Beatty Manuscript Museum in easy walking distance is a must-see.  

The amenities at the Westin were top-notch: the Atrium for afternoon tea, the Exchange for wonderful breakfasts, the Mint Bar for light supper and drinks. 

The rooms are all recently renovated and the staff fall all over themselves trying to please. Fromreception to concierge, to Peter at the front door.

There is internet on the room TV and free use of the business center 24 hours a day.

I wouldn't stay anywhere else on my next trip to Dublin.",5,2013,05,09
202,Superb central location,"I stayed here for one night. I usually opt for the Shelbourne, but it was full. The Westin was better in a few ways. The room, although smaller, appeared fresher (probably due to the colours used) and I thought that the quality of the food at breakfast was superior (but wasn't included in my rate). My room overlooked Trinity College and from the third floor the traffic was barely audible. ",5,2013,05,08
202,Staying in Dublin - Stay Here!,"If you're heading to Dublin - Don't look further than the Westin.

This place is in the perfect place for exploring Dublin. Walking distance to everything and right next to Trinity college, Temple Bar in central London.

The Airobus (the blue one) from the airport stops right near the front door so its a breeze to get in from the airport. 

Rooms are great! Nice and big and clean, and the bathrooms are sensational. I reckon that a way to tell a good hotel is by the quality of the shower!! This place is tops! Sensational shower!

Staff were great, check in a breeze, they stored out bags before checkin and after checkout too. 

For a cool place for a drink - check out the mint bar in the old bank vaults down stairs.

Had a great stay here - would return without a doubt!",5,2013,05,07
202,Another pleasant stay in Dublun,"Have stayed here several times on business - Platinum SPG member normally means a suite upgrade (even had presidential suite on one occasion with my own Steam Room). Reception staff are welcoming and hotel is always clean. Great location moments from Grafton Street and Trinity College. 
Would recommend.",4,2013,05,07
202,"Great location, nicely appointed rooms","I should start out by saying that I'm a HUGE Starwood fan and try to stay at their hotels where ever I am.  I used points for our stay at the Westin Dublin and was not disappointed.  The hotel is perfectly situated across from Temple Bar and a short walk to the train station.  It's a beautiful location with tons of pubs, restaurants, bars and shopping all in walking distance.  Our first room was nicely appointed with a queen size bed overlooking the centrium of the hotel.  The room had a very large closet and nice size bathroom with tub.  One design flaw we noticed was the location of the toilet paper holder...does no one sit on the toilet to figure out where the paper should be located before they mount to the wall?  We really like the room, but after inspecting the floor layout on the back of the door (love those) and know that we would be entertaining, we called the front desk to see if we could upgrade.  Luckily, there was a nice suite available and we could use more points for the upgrade...done!  We moved to our new digs and WOW was the first impressions.  Our room was two levels with a spiral staircase in the corner.  The bedroom/bathroom on the first floor and the living/sitting room was upstairs.  Both levels were accessible from the hall so we could have our guests enter at the upper level and not have to see the mess that was our suitcases and souvenirs.  The hotel has a great restaurant as well as a pub area in the centrium.  This is a great hotel and one that we would stay at again the next time we are in Dublin.",4,2013,05,07
202,Excellent Hotel,"Stayed one night at the Westin on Saturday 4th May.
Excellent location, so convenient to all the attractions in 
Dublin.   The staff, from receiption, concierge to restaurant
staff were so helpful and efficient.  Was
upgraded to a Deluxe room which was everything one
could wish for with a lovely view over Trinity College.
I have never slept on such a comfortable
pillow in my life - must get one for my home!!!!  The whole
ambiance of the hotel is such a delight.
The breakfast was delicious, such an array of fresh food all
beautifully presented.
If I had one slight problem, we were booked on a package
with dinner and tickets to the Lion King.   Its just the restaurant
does not open until 6pm and the show started at 7.30 so 
unfortunately our delicious dinner was a bit rushed - but the
waitress was most accommodating.  Perhaps
could I suggest that a 5.30 opening for the restaurant be 
available for such evenings.  Wonderful stay, will definitely 
recommend to friends and it will be my number one for my
next stay in Dublin.",5,2013,05,07
202,Nice hotel,"Although on a busy thoroughfare the interior of the hotel was relatively quiet. The Westin is in a prime location, most sites of interest are within walking distance with perhaps the exception of the zoo. The hop on, hop off bus is really good value and an excellent way to get your bearings. The hotel has tasteful decor and our junior suite was well presented, clean and comfortable. Staff members are attentive, polite and amiable. Generally speaking a faultless establishment.",5,2013,05,07
202,Great Location,"We visited the Westin recently and were quite impressed. The general accommodation was very impressive from the minute we entered the hotel. Unfortunately the food while being good could have been better,The staff were very helpful. We will return",4,2013,05,07
202,"Great hotel, staff superb!Expensive but a nice treat!","Stayed here for one night only but was lovely! The room was not the biggest but the receptionist had told us this, which was good! Bathroom v spacious and coffee making in room was real filter coffee!! Breakfast was nice but I was expecting the 'wow' factor and it wasn't there however it had all the usuals - fruit, bread, cereals and the fry up in big silver paltters (which looked a bit mass produced) We had dinner the also and the early bird offer of 2 courses for 19.50 or 3 for 24.50 was excellent. Another surprise but a lovely one was the offer of a 'quick' Yonka Back massage - 5 euro for 5 minutes or 10 euro for ten minutes - this was a great idea! The location of the hotel is superb - right next to Trinity & Grafton Street and all the sites - with a bus stop and taxi rank outside the door - not that you need it with the masses of taxis available to flag! The atrium lounge is lovely an unusual with most of the rooms overlookng this central very high area where guests can relax - it has a lovely feel about it. If you can afford a stay here - then go for it! If not - treat yourself at least once!!!!",4,2013,05,06
202,Great hotel in the center of Dublin,"We stayed two nights in late April.  Perfect location, and the hotel was wonderful.  Very comfortable upscale room overlooki8ng the atrium.  Had dinner at The Exchange, and it was 5 star.  Hats off to Diarmaid, the restaurant manager.",5,2013,05,03
202,Location great but disappointing room,"Hotel is in thw heart of the city across from Trinity College so easy walking distance to sites and restaurants.   As an elite Starwood member i used points for my recent stay but was very disappointed with the room they provided.   The hotel was not full yet i was placed in a rather small room. The bed was small - questionable as a queen.   The bathroom was slanted which made the soap slide off the sink and provided a weird carnival funhouse effect with the mirror.  The counter space was non-existent and the ceiling in the tub shower was very low.   I am only 5' 6"" and had to bend to wash my hair.   While the service was nice the room was cerainly not up to brand standard.",3,2013,05,03
202,Great stay for a first time visit,"After deciding to book a first-time trip to Dublin and reading reviews of various hotels, I selected the Westin Dublin based on location and the Westin name.  I was not disappointed.  This review is based on a 6 night stay at the end of April 2013.

I arrived in Dublin shortly after 8:00 AM and was initially concerned as to whether or not a room would be available for check-in since the advertised check-in time was 3:00 PM.  The front desk staff was very pleasant and, luckily, a room was available upon arrival.  Throughout my stay, the staff was attentive and ready to answer any questions.  They were quick to pull out a map, draw out directions, and make recommendations for places to visit and dine.

The queen-bed room I was assigned was located on the 4th floor and had a slight view of Westmoreland Street and a direct view of a small office building.  Considering most of the trip was to be spent exploring the city, I was mainly happy to have a room that provided natural light.  There was no discernible street noise from the room, and the window had both sheer and blackout curtains.  Tastefully decorated, the room had a comfortable feeling about it.  The bed was cozy and there were ample pillows to make for a pleasant night's sleep.

I was surprised by the large size of the bathroom which consisted of both a stand-up shower and a separate soaking tub. A minor issue, which may just be due to the plumbing in Dublin, was that the toilet needed to be flushed multiple times on occasion (I experienced this at several other locations throughout Dublin).  The water pressure and temperature settings in the shower and sink were both adequate/responsive.

Room service was ordered one morning for breakfast and the food was delivered promptly, accurately, and at the appropriate temperatures (hot food was hot, cold liquids were cold).

The only problem experienced during the stay was that the mounted television lost service several times.  After extensive troubleshooting, the cause turned out to be a faulty cable.  I am a firm believer that a true sign of a good hotel is how they handle these kinds of situations and the Westin Dublin did not disappoint.  Besides the immediate attention to fix the problem (sending staff multiple times), the hotel management provided a complimentary bottle of wine and snack tray to apologize for the inconvenience.  That is truly stellar service.

As for location, the Westin Dublin really is in a great spot for tourists and first-time visitors.  Trinity College, multiple museums and shopping areas, airport shuttle bus stops, and the Temple Bar area are all a short stroll from the hotel.  The location made it easy to be a tourist.

The only thing that could have made the Westin Dublin better was if it offered free wi-fi access.  I purchased a plan that ran the length of my stay (up to 3 devices can connect to the room plan) so that I could access the internet from my room.  While exploring the city, I utilized the various free wi-fi services offered in Dublin--many establishments in the city seem to have wi-fi availability for free or with purchase, and there are several zones that allow for free access at touristy sites.

Overall, I had an excellent stay at the Westin Dublin and have already recommended it to others.",5,2013,05,02
202,Lovely but not 100%,"Had a weekend break with a small group of friends.  We paid extra for the Deluxe room which was well worth the extra.  All three rooms we had were very well appointed and all had different features either in space or bathroom, but we were very happy. The beds were gorgeous.
The service offered by the reception and the concierge was first class as they were helpful and informative. The concierge was particularly knowledgeable at recommending dining venues etc.
The biggest disappointment was the tea tray in the bedrooms. Saturday morning when we awoke, I went to make tea but there were not any milk sachets.  A phone call quickly resolved this and milk was bought.  As there were only 2 Breakfast TBags we assumed that it was an oversight and the tray would be replenished.  Unfortunately on our return, after a very busy, tiring day, we had only been left 2 Breakfast TBags, we don't drink Earl Grey or Coffee.  As one of my friends summed it up ""you get more in a Premier Inn"".  It may seem trivial but it was unexpected in a hotel of this quality.",4,2013,04,30
202,Excellent City Break!,"The Westin Dublin is an excellent hotel!  Me and my boyfriend stayed here in April 2013 for three nights.  This was our first trip to Dublin, and wanted to stay somewhere really nice, and decided on the Westin.  We decided to pay the extra for a Deluxe room, which was well worth the money!  We had a large spacious room at the front of the hotel over looking the streets which lead onto Temple Bar, it had a large bathroom with sperate bath and shower, and the compfiest bed I have ever had the pleasure of sleeping on!  I had organised some wine to be delivered to the room as it was my boyfriends birthday, which they did as soon as we arrived.  On our first morning we also had room service breakfast as a treat, it was lovely and really relaxing!  When we got back to our hotel on the second day we had another bottle of wine delivered to the room (off my parents) but the hotel had alos organised for a dessert with happy birthday written on and a card to be delivered to us from the hotel, this was a really nice touch!  

I would have to say the only negative about the Westin, is that the wi-fi is not free, you have to pay 6 euros an hour, which is something I expect not to have to do in hotels now, as I could have visited the Starbucks 3 doors down and got wi-fi for free.  They did have a business centre which we did use to print off boarding passes for our flight home.  There was a bit of dust on the bed side drawers also in the room, but toher than this this hotel could not be faulted!

I would deffinatley recommend this hotel to anyone visiting Dublin!  Thank you for a brilliant stay!",5,2013,04,29
202,Location & Service,"The Westin Dublin is a lovely hotel. The staff could not have done more to assure me of a pleasant stay. The young concierge offered up some terrific suggestions for dinner and he was helpful with maps and sightseeing. My room was beautiful. Very spacious with a large, marble bathroom, lots of closets and of course, the trademark Westin bed that was ""heavenly."" I loved the fact that the hotel was fitted into several old, historic, heritage buildings, thus saving them from demolition. And, the location? The best... right across from Trinity College (and the Book of Kells) and a short walk from everything any tourist might want, including Dublin and airport express bus lines. My only two criticisms: a) charging 10 Euros daily for room Wi-Fi is ridiculous. Most hotels have switched to free Wi-Fi. The Westin should, too;  b) on check-out there was a long line. So, I went out, had breakfast, and came back. I had to again wait in line. I was told that someone hadn't shown up that day, hence the line. I had a very positive experience at the Westin Dublin and highly recommend it. A great place to stay!",4,2013,04,28
202,Outstanding service,"This was our 2nd trip to this hotel. As stated in my 1st review, the location is perfect for exploring all Dublin has to offer and we had a lovely suite room. We took this as a break as I am undertaking treatment for a serious illness and unfortunately I became ill whilst staying at the hotel. The staff were really helpful and supportive to my husband and helped to deal with the situation efficiently and sensitively. A minor mix up with luggage resulted in my husband and I missing our flight home, but Luwen the duty manager was an absolute star in rectifying the situation and making sure I was as comfortabale as possible. Not to mention dealing with my extremely stressed husband!! This was reflective of all the staff at this hotel, from the restaurant to housekeeping I also witnessed staff in reception dealing with a particularly obnoxious and rude guest (no not my husband) in a professional and calm manner. Food is good, rooms are spotless, would highly recommend this hotel.",5,2013,04,27
202,Faultless,"This was a birthday treat for my first time to Ireland.  (was on the ""Bucket list"").  What a brilliant experience for my first time to Ireland.  There were no faults at all with this place.  Rooms were beautiful, bedding, facilities etc etc.  Staff during the whole stay were well trained, friendly, helpful, all were a credit to the hotel.  Plus what an excellent Doorman to greet and help, what a welcome to the hotel, many thanks Peter for his assistance finding our bearings in Dublin.  The Mint Bar, great to sit at the bar and watch the staff making the cocktails, my they work so hard but stayed friendly and helpful.  Do not miss going down for a drink and the experience.  Thanks also for the birthday chocolate shortbread left in out room, lovely touch and very yummy.  I would 100% recommend this hotel to anyone going to Ireland also great location.  We  purchased the the 3 day transport pass which was well placed when our feet ached and the return trip to the airport.   Massive thanks for making our stay so pleasurable.",5,2013,04,24
202,"Worth every penny, great location and service","We stayed at the Westin for 3 nights early April. A group of 8 girls, double rooms, hen party. A very impressive building, fab location in the heart of city centre 5 min walk to grafton street and temple bar. The rooms are big, modern and clean, the most comfortable bed ive ever slept in, im not exaggerating! We had afternoon at Atrium, absolutly delish, mojito serverd in teapots, amazing. Food was fresh and free wifi in parts of building was very handy. The gym is small but not many people using it. Try Avoca for breakfast or lunch, absolutely delicious food and service. I would defo recommend and stay again.",5,2013,04,23
202,Best hotel in Dublin,"From the super friendly staff, the superb room, the great shower (American style pressure :)), a varied and delicious breakfast buffet, and the utterly unbeatable location - this is an excellent hotel. Oh: and the Mint Bar ain't bad as well",5,2013,04,22
202,Afternoon Tea - Westin Dublin,"Tea at the Westin is set in the upstairs Atrium away from the hustle and bustle of the main lobby and entrance. The Atrium is is bright because of skylights but there are no windows and this adds to the sense of withdrawal from the busy streets of Dublin‚Äôs city centre. The calmness inside and well-spaced tables make it ideal for quiet get-togethers or meetings.

The tea list was extensive and confusing.  There are three pages of tea over two separate menus. I wasn‚Äôt too sure what to make of it all. On the one hand I was impressed to see a Yellow tea on a hotel menu and there was an impressive selection of Black and Green tea. On the other hand have no idea what a Fire Mountain Yellow Tea is and there were two huge categories of tea missing: Oolong and Pu-erh.

I ordered the Jasmine Silver Needle White tea and was duly presented with the Flowering Osmanthus Green Tea! I was really happy for the mix-up. I just wish they had prepared it in front of me so I could see it beforehand and watch it ‚Äúbloom‚Äù. Osmanthus flower can be dried and prepared on its own as a herbal tea but for flowering teas, green tea is handtied around the flower. It starts off as a small round ball and expands to reveal colourful flower when hot water is added. These teas are appreciated for their visual appeal rather than their taste and that held true in this case too.

The food on the other hand was very flavoursome. The sandwiches and scones (with clotted cream) were fresh and tasty but the fruit cake and pastries were outstanding. There was a chocolate cup of Irish whiskey cream, pistachio macaroon, lemon sponge cake,  red velvet cake and cheesecake with berries. They were all delicate and delicious.

Surprisingly, after about an hour I was told that the table was reserved and I would need to move to another table (there were plenty) or leave before 4:30pm.  I had finished eating and wasn‚Äôt in the mood for playing musical chairs so I left but was miffed that my relaxing afternoon  was turned into a clock-watching situation.

Afternoon tea at the Westin is ‚Ç¨24 which is not bad for the city centre location, the relaxing setting and above-average pasteries. To avoid being rushed, it would be worth confirming at the booking stage that they do not need the table back.",4,2013,04,22
202,Great Stay,"Great location in the middle of the city, easy walking distance to temple bar, grafton and most of the city sites.  The hotel bar, The Mint bar, is really nice for starting or ending your evening in Dublin.  The hotel staff recommended some really good restaurants during our stay, booked cab service for us, helped with luggage and were overall very attentive.  We got down to the restaurant right before breakfast service stopped and they accomadated us without making us feel we bothered or inconvienenced them at all.  It's a bit pricey but well worth it for the service, comfortable bed, large bathroom (compared to most all other places we stayed in Ireland) and location!  Only complaint would be having to pay for wifi.  If McDonald's offers free wifi I would think a five star hotel would.  The b&b's we stayed at even offered free wifi so I found it a bit odd that we had to pay $7 euro for one hour of service.",5,2013,04,19
202,Always a pleasure!,"My last stay at this hotel was seven years ago and things have only got better at this hotel. The classic room on the top floor was recently refurbished, large, very comfortable with a nice view of the street below. The staff were all exceptionally friendly and accommodating. If you're having an in-room breakfast, the bacon and egg muffin is a must! I can't wait to stay at this hotel again.",5,2013,04,19
202,Excellent!!!!,"My wife and I stayed here for St. Patrick's Day and had one of the best experiences.  Staff was extremely accommodating and helpful with directing us around town.   Front desk kept our bags for us, since we were a few hours early to check in and called us to inform us the room was ready.  The location was ideal for shopping and pub crawling.  The bus to and from the airport drops you off right in front of the hotel.  There is not one bad thing I could say about this place.",5,2013,04,19
202,Cocktail Making Class,"I booked a Cocktail making class for 4 of us and it was a really enjoyable experience. Our ""cocktail professor"" was called Mike and he was really lovely and sohelpful. We have a wonderful evening and I would highly recommend it. The hotel is lovely and overall a very pleasent evening",5,2013,04,19
202,Quality hotel in excellent location,"The Westin Dublin is a premium hotel in the heart of the city, right next to the shops and temple bar area. Service in the hotel was excellent and rooms are well appointed and as described on hotel website. Wifi is available in the hotel lobby for free but was annoyed that I needed to pay 15 Euro to get 24 hours use in my room. Not on when you are already paying a premium for this hotel.
Overall a great stay and lovely room.",4,2013,04,17
202,Wonderful hotel,Spent the weekend in The Westin Dublin to celebrate a significant birthday. From the moment we arrived the staff took excellent care of us. The college suite is amazing with excellent views of Westmoreland Street and Trinity College. Breakfast was a gourmet experience from start to finish. It reminded us of The Westin Dragonara in Malta. Dinner was also delightful with a wonderful selection of food all cooked to perfection. The staff are all friendly and efficient and nothing is too much trouble for them. We went to the bar on Saturday night and enjoyed some cocktails while we listened to the band. We would definitely recommend The Westin for a luxury break to remember.,5,2013,04,15
202,Perfect location,"Even though you're right in the busy city centre, once entered the Westin hotel, you can breathe easy. Nice and warm place with a fireplace in the front lobby makes you aware of entering a right place. Rooms are newly refurbished, bathrooms are with with both shower and bath, and the Classic room I had was more spacious, than I've expected. The greatest strength of the hotel is the location, which couldn't be any better, it's right in the city centre, only minutes walk to the main shopping areas, and just on the opposite side of the Temple Bar, one of the most famous streets in Dublin with live music everyday, where you can enjoy a real Irish experience with a pint of Guinness in your hand singing 'Whiskey In The Jar'.",5,2013,04,15
202,Clean...Comfy hotel with Excellent location.,"Just returned from a 3 night stay.... Hotel is excellent very comfy ,spotless with friendly helpful staff.    Free room upgrade was fab the deluxe double and the afternoon tea was lovely must book.   hotel was in great location for 2 young ladies visiting and being bang in the centre.   Asked member of bar staff of any good places to eat on the first night.... She advised the Bank which was 5 min walk from the hotel.... And wow was fab ....food was great. 
The bar in the hotel open to the public had a Salsa night was great music and seemed good fun so myself and my friend visited after a night out as we heard the music from reception.  If however you are a female alone I would advise to stay away if Salsa night is on the men visiting this bar were of all nationalities and a right pain, actually more than a pain right pests.
Apart from that the hotel overall was fab and would def return.

Good night out if you have the time look up Merry Ploughboy was a fantastic night out, live Irish band, Irish dancers and fab food..... Must book!!",5,2013,04,14
202,The Westin is a great place to stay & I will stay there again when I visit Dublin,"My wife and I stayed 7 nights at the Westin Dublin and were very pleased.  The Westin allowed us  into our hotel room at 7 am  when we arrived from the USA which helped cure the travel lag.  The room was large by European standards.  The beds were very comfortable. Best of all however is that the hotel is located in what I believe is the best and safest tourist location in all of Dublin.

I wholeheartedly recommend the Westin Hotel in Dublin.  I am scheduled to return to Dublin at least once during the next 2 years and I plan to stay at the Westin for my return trip.

Best.",5,2013,04,14
202,Best location!!!,"Stayed in March 2013. The staff was lovely. We had a room overlooking the main street, but traffic did not bother at all. We walked everywhere during the day and the weather was wonderful. The food in the bar was delish...I had the fish n chips two days in a row!!! Very relaxing, front desk and concierge could not be more helpful/nice. They made our trip to Dublin one of the best ever.",5,2013,04,13
202,"Location, Location, Location","Unbelievable location in the heart of Dublin.  Everything was within walking distance or just take the Hop On/Off bus close by.  The staff is attentive, helpful, and the room was excellent.  Bed was excellent and personalized service was appreciated.  The breakfast choices were well prepared and presented.",5,2013,04,13
202,Great location,This is a very nice hotel with friendly staff and an excellent central location. Rooms are quite and clean. There is a modern workout room? The Mint bar is a nice place to have a drink or light meal the curry chicken was very good. ,5,2013,04,13
202,Perfect Location,"This hotel is both an ideal base for exploring Dublin and the rooms do not disappoint either. I asked, as it was my boyfriends birthday for a room, with a view which they did for me ( lovely view of Trinity) and they had also left a little birthday cake in our room as well- nice touch. Would definitely stay here again on my next Dublin visit.",5,2013,04,10
202,Perfect location in Temple Bar area!!!,"The Westin was a great hotel for anyone looking for a hotel near the Temple Bar area.  It was close to all attractions: night life, St. Stephen's Green, Trinity College, Grafton Street and O'Connel Street.  The area was safe and easy for us to get home after a night out. 
The rooms were spacious and very clean.  The bed was comfortable and a nice king size.  My only complaint was that our room was on the inside of the hotel so we had a window out to the hotel atrium rather than the outside.  So there was no natural light or fresh air.  I would request a room on the outside. ",4,2013,04,09
202,A wonderful stay in Dublin,"I was a little concerned because the reviews were not fantastic on TriAdvisor.  I need to say that from the moment we walked in the hotel, everything was perfect.  Our room was lovely, the service was fantastic and the dinner recommendations were perfect.  The location, well, you cannot beat it.",5,2013,04,08
202,Perfect Location and Great Stay,"My husband and I decided to take a trip to Ireland, in our planning we decided we would do a self drive tour and stay at the best B&B's we could find.  However, we flew from LAX to Heathrow and connected to Dublin so after roughly 17 hours of travel time we knew we would spend a couple nights in Dublin before beginning our tour.  We decided to stay at the Westin for our first two nights and only wished we had the same accomodations for most of our trip. It is in a perfect location, central Dublin just a couple blocks walk to Temple Bar and Trinity College as well as the Hop On/Hop Off bus route.  Upon pulling up, they will handle your bags or allow you to and park your car. As in any big city, parking is a premium so best to park at the hotel and walk or bus it around town. We got to our room and as Americans you have to understand rooms of a European standard are much smaller but the layout of our standard room was much large than most other European hotels we have stayed in. The room was recently renovated, very classy. The bathroom had both tub and shower and was very clean.  There was absolutely nothing that concerned me and bathrooms are my biggest fear as far as cleanliness.  Our window looked out onto the atrium so no view but most importantly it was quiet.  Being in the city centre a room facing the exterior may have been. The room had a large closet to fit our clothes and suitcases (we carry on bags so 1 suitcase and 1 personal item), refrigerator, flat screen, internet, desk and the bed was oh so comfortable, what Westin Dream Beds are known for. We did not use the spa, it appeared to be very tiny. We did not dine at the restaurant. We did utilize the services of the front desk that were always so helpful in helping us find a good restuarant or our way around.  It was the perfect start to our tour of Ireland.",5,2013,04,08
202,"Excellent Hotel, Excellent Location","My husband and I stayed here as the last location before we headed home and let me just say, it was great.  The room was so comfortable.  After staying at lesser hotels throughout other parts of Europe, it was a true delight to lay down on the bed and feel how comfortbale it is.  The room was clean, the bed was comfortable, and the bathroom was magnificent.  What makes this hotel truly superb though is the service of the staff.  They are truly amazing.  My husband went down to ask if they could remove the items from the mini bar because we had a few things we wanted to store in there.  They explained they couldnt do to the nature of the charges and then offered to bring us a completely seperate refrigirator.  The concierege was extremely helpful with helping us book reservations and taxis.  He was also incredibly astute when it came to good places to eat.  Also, since it was my husbands and I honeymoon, we came back to the room where the hotel had palced two yummy cakes that said congratulations on them.  It was quite incredible.  Because I believe that you should include a few negatives in every review, I do have a few complaints.  To begin with, their is free wifi in the lobby, bar, and mezanine, however, when you enter your room it becomes extremely expensive which just dosent make sense to me.  Also, avoid eating the breakfast in the hotel.  We were leaving rather early and decided that it would be easier to just grab something quick.  To get the Irish breakfast, it was 19 Euro. I dont have a problem paying for something when it's good, but you could walk 10 minutes either direction and find an Irish breakfast just as good for far less.  These few things, however, do not ditract from the over all amazing qualities that the hotel has to offer.  Would highly recommend.",5,2013,04,07
202,"Good, but I didn't think 5 star!","I stayed in early January. Last few times I've stayed at the Westbury.  Loved the location, not as central to Grafton Street as The Westbury, but darn close,the building exterior and the fact that they haven't tried to make it too modern. Easy SPG check in and was upgraded to a top floor room with a balcony ( never did figure how to open the balcony door and there was no concierge on hand to demo all the room's amenities). Room was nice, spacious for European city standards, generous bathroom, iPod/iPhone speaker dock, Westin bedding, nice new of Dublin.   Ate at Mint Bar, very good, simple, unpretentious food, good selection of beers and attentive bar staff.  Only negatives were paying for wifi, no help with baggage from street into lobby ( there are stairs not a ramp into an elevated lobby), no real 5 star level of service.  All in all, it's as good as The Westbury but I'm not sure 5 Star sits easily with either hotel.  The room rate was decent value for what you get, so I can't say anything too negative.  I will be back in Dublin soon and will be torn between it and The Westbury, or perhaps it's time to try another hotel?",4,2013,04,05
202,Great stay,"Room was ready when we arrived which was great!!! They upgraded us to suite because we were Starwood prefered members. Room was great very clean but the rooms are not what makes this hotel. The staff and service was outstanding. Everyone is always smiling and pleasant and ready to help you in any way they can. The concierges were great and even made us our own pub crawl mapped out because none were going the night we wanted to go. Mint Bar had great drinks and again everyone was so nice!!!!
As a travel professional this will be my go to hotel for sure.",5,2013,04,01
202,Lovely Hotel,"Just stayed here for one night and from what i did get to see it was a beautiful hotel. i had an early flight from London to dublin and got to the hotel quite early about 9am and our room wasn't ready which was fine so we went across the road and had breakfast in starbucks! i went to Dublin for a concert, it was to see Lawson at the 02 Academy which is a lovely little venue! after about an hour of wondering around we went back to the hotel and our room was ready. even the lifts are lovely, so clean and pretty. the room we had was a really good size and i loved the bathroom ! the doors give it that Parisian style, absolutely beautiful! the beds and soooo comfortable i could of slept then and there but i had to get ready for the concert ! we had a view of the main road which was nice and we could see the canal from our room. the staff were lovely and so polite. they organised a morning cab for us to the airport and the cab was so chic ! 
all in all a very lovely stay in dublin, its a fab city and i would recommend staying at the westin !",4,2013,04,01
202,Great Place to Stay,"We had a very pleasant one-night stay here recently. They held on to our luggage on our early arrival and were very prompt in letting us know when our rooms became available before check in time. Rooms had enough space, though not huge. Very clean and the staff was welcoming and courteous. Get a room with a view of Trinity College if possible - very nice.",5,2013,03,31
202,Very good,"The hotel is centrally located, almost directly near O'Connell Bridge, and right next to Temple Bar. Nevertheless, in the room it was very quiet. The rooms are very spacious and beautiful. The bathroom was the biggest, I've ever experienced in a hotel, with shower and bath. Since the rooms were not ready when we arrived, we were able to leave our luggage and it was then placed directly into the room. Also in the morning after checking out there was no problem with the luggage. The staff is very friendly, so all in all a highly recommended hotel.",5,2013,03,29
202,Quality Hotel with minor drawbacks,"I stay at the Westin Hotel atleast once a month for a week on business. The rooms are always excellent, clean, spacious, good beds, and just a really convenient location in the city etc. Everything is excellent so I'll focus on the bits that you need to be aware of:

1. Wifi is paid (as per other reviews, this is ridiculous in 2013) - However, my company does get free Wifi, so if you are here on business regularly, you may be able to negotiate a deal.
2. The gym is TINY and often very busy on weekdays after work.

Those two points keep it from receiving an excellent score overall. Otherwise, you can't go wrong with this hotel for just about everything else.",4,2013,03,26
202,"Great central hotel, but looses its top grade on...","having to pay for WiFi which shouldn't be necessarry in 2013.

Other than that the hotel is great. Stayed at room 100, which was much larger than expected. Great bed, and the option to choose between a bath or a shower in the bathroom. Extra points for having Sky Sports for free.

Stayed over the St.Patricks weekend so of course some noise from the nearby streets, but nothing out of the ordinary. Bar was well over expectation, quite crowded and with good live music and great staff. Decent prices also considering The Westin being a bit upscale. Breaksfast was good, but nothing out of the ordinary and the exact same buffet everyday for three days.

Location is great. Near shopping, Temple Bar, and the river. Just perfect and for the St.Patricks parade it passes straight outside the hotel, so be sure to ask fo a view of that street if you're not allergic to drums, bans and singing (which in that case means that you have travelled on the wrong weekend)",4,2013,03,20
202,"Quality hotel, quality staff","High quality hotel in excellent location. Staff were brilliant. We loved relaxing in the atrium lounge at the end of the day. Rooms were spacious, especially considering the location. Some are interior (windows onto the atrium) which didn't bother our friends, but would have bothered me.
If you drive, let the concierge staff park your car. It turned out cheaper -- and much less hassle -- than self-parking.
The gym is a bit small, though the equipment is new and high quality.",5,2013,03,20
202,"Good hotel, central location very noisy","We stayed here last minute after deciding to go out for St.Patricks day and hotel was a fair price through last minute.com.

Rooms were nice, albeit fairly standard when staying in the higher end Starwood chains, as always the bed was large and comfortable and as said by other reviewers the bathroom was massive.

Check in and out was slow, something that seems to be more prevalent when staying in 5* hotels nowadays, I suppose the person being served likes the special treatment.

Oly two complaints that I have were that the hotel seemed to be full of Children constantly running about the hotel and the other was that our second floor room overlooked the road opposite the side of an office block that is only accessible by public service vehicles that seemed to love nothing more than revving the engines of their busses, trucks. I can't imagine what the noise would have been like on a normal working day rather than being a bank holiday.

Would I return yes but I would have to get an inward facing room",4,2013,03,19
202,Absolutely great stay,"(open cards: am SPG platinum, which greatly influenced stay experience)

From a EUR120 rate, got upgraded to a great 'writer' suite (living room separate, balcony with - sort of - a view over Dublin).

Apart from the fantastic room: very friendly staff (reception, breakfast, bar downstairs), had very high quality food throughout (not 'cheap', but definitely worth the money). Hotel itself is just a superb & original building, and location can't be beat - steps away from Temple Bar.

By far favourite choice in Dublin !",5,2013,03,19
202,Fabulous,"I stayed with the Westin for 5 nights.  I was absolutely thrilled with the enormous beds, immaculate rooms, luxurious baths, excellent customer service and central location.  I will book the Westin everytime.",5,2013,03,19
202,"Good hotel, but I really don't see what all the fuss is about","In reading TripAdvisor reviews for this hotel before my stay, I was prepared for an above-and-beyond experience. I've reviewed several Westins over the years, and the high quality is consistent. This hotel is no exception to that consistent quality, but I wouldn't be nearly as effusive in my praise as some other reviewers. The rooms are well-appointed - Westin amenities throughout, from bedding to the white tea soap - but nothing that screams the next level of luxury. Room size does vary, so do be sure when you book that you know precisely what you're getting. I was upgraded upon check-in to a Deluxe room, which is about the size (if slightly smaller) of a typical US king-bed room. I was appreciative that they honored my early check-in request (I arrived about 11am, Starwood Gold). The breakfast buffet was quite good, but as with any hotel breakfast, overpriced even given the quality of the meal. Don't get me wrong - the property is worthy of the Westin name and I'd certainly stay here again if in Dublin - just don't get your hopes up thinking it will be an out-of-this-world five star experience.",4,2013,03,17
202,"Great location, friendly staff, large bathrooms!","Spent two nights at the Westin Dublin.   It is in a great location next to trinity college and in the mix of everything.  The staff was extremely helpful in providing recommendations and setting up a car rental.  Rooms were a good size, beds were comfortable and the bathroom was large with a separate glass shower / tub - in my mind bathrooms make or break a great hotel room.  I stayed at the Shelbourne and I would recommend the Westin over it.  Also, try and request a room in the front looking out at the street - courtyard windows aren't real windows.",4,2013,03,17
202,A St. Patricks Day stay,"The Westin brand is our favourite brand of hotels mostly because they never disappoint! Our visit was centered around St. Patrick's day and we were in the best location ever! We were checked in late in the evening and the enthusiasm from our attendant was fabulous. She was informative, pleasant, warm and genuine. She let us know that the St. Patricks parade would pass right under our window! 
The Mint Bar food was spectacular, special mention for the lamb chops and the beef cheeks! The bar tender we had was a woman who knew how to make a hell of a cocktail! She was so warm and we enjoyed spending the evenings there.
Service is best in class, the attendants at breakfast in The Exchange were so genuine and very attentive.
Not the cheapest hotel on the block but the proximity to everywhere including Trinity College and Temple Bar, the warmth of staff and service is more than worth the price.
I am writing this review as I watch the parade through my room window as I could not wait to reach home. Westin, you never disappoint!",5,2013,03,17
202,Luxury in the centre of Dublin,"The Westin was a perfect location for a weekend in Dublin with my husband. Great rooms, with divine Irish linen on the beds! Close to temple bar, Dawson st and the shops on Grafton st. The mint bar do a great cocktail and the live music on Friday was a good way to start the weekend ",5,2013,03,17
202,Is this really five-star?,"We recently stayed for two nights at the Westin Hotel, Dublin - I wished to treat my wife while I was attending some business meetings. Overall impression - disappointed. The check-in was unecessarily fussy and took too long - asking Irish people for ""photo ID"" when they're in Ireland is a certain way to rile them - whoever came up with that policy doesn't understand Ireland.

The room certainly was not five-star - it was small and stuffy. The ""wardrobe"" was obviously designed with Pygmies in mind - it would be difficult to hang anything in it. Internet was advertised at ""‚Ç¨6 per hour"" - a bit steep when most hotels provide this service free gratis. This situation was further compounded when I was checking out - I had used the internet for probably 45 minutes in total - when I checked my bill I discovered that I had been charged for six hours! Obviously, the system starts a new hour every time one connects - surely this could be sorted easily.
My car was parked for me by a friendly usher - the parking fee came to ‚Ç¨25 per day! If I had known that, I would have parked in the carpark across the street! Breakfast in the dining room was another fairly ordinary experience - on both mornings we had to repeat our request for toast.
In general I was disappointed. Prior to staying there, I had checked several city-centre hotels - all the Dublin hotels are back to their bad old habits - room rates are back on top of the European league. Cop yourselves on, Folks - we Irish are tired of ""racehorse rates"" and ""donkey service"".

202,Excellent Hotel for Small Business Meetings,"The Westin Dublin is a gereat hotel.
Great location, great services, excellent staff, nicely furnished and a very good selection for breakfast, afternoon tea and dinner.
We have been there with ahigh class delegation of 12 and the service could not have been better. 
Especially in the meetings area there was a lot of flexibility.
We will come again for sure.",5,2013,03,13
202,Terrific hotel,"My husband and I spent a week at the Westin Hotel Dublin in August.  I can't say enough about the really lovely experience we had at this hotel.  Our room was tremendously comfortable and clean with a huge bathroom, the staff was uniformly friendly and helpful, and the restaurant (where we ate dinner a couple of times during the week) was delicious.   I should add we also enjoyed breakfast in the Atrium.  This hotel is close to everything -- Trinity College, the Book of Kells, Temple Bar, the wonderful Chester Beatty Library with its collection of illuminated manuscripts, the city's shopping area, etc.   Overall we found Dublin to be a very hospitable city, but this hotel really made us feel at home.  We have traveled a good bit to other world-class cities and this may be the best hotel we've ever stayed at.  We look forward to staying here again!",5,2013,03,10
202,"Fantastic hotel, great location, best concierge staff","We arrived at the Westin for a two night stay so we needed the concierge services to prioritize some activities during our quick trip and suggest breakfast and dinner options. All members of the concierge staff were extremely helpful, giving us exactly what we were looking for and providing additional hints so that we could make the most of our short stay in Dublin. We even got a really short notice reservation at an amazing restaurant. The hotel itself was great. The location was ideal and the rooms were immaculate. We would definitely choose to stay here again anytime visiting Dublin.",5,2013,03,09
202,"Top Notch Service, Perfect Location","I stayed at the Westin Dublin in Feb 2013 on a leisure trip to Ireland.  I chose the Westin based on it's high Trip Advisor score and on the recommendation of a friend who lives in Dublin.  Let's just say that the location is PERFECT.  From the Westin, you are as close to the Temple Bar as you can get without staying in a hotel above one of the noisy street and crowded pubs.  You are across the street from Trinity College, and a 5-10 minute walk from Grafton Street shopping and St. Stephen's Green.  I would say the location is most ideal.

The rooms were all well appointed and including features that I personally value like an iPod compatible alarm clock.  I love playing my iPod, but never like to haul around iPod speakers when traveling.  Our bathroom also included full size tub and separate glass shower.  You could also pump the programming from the TV into the bathroom, which again is something I highly value.

The hotel offers top-notch service from check-in to check-out.  I found all of the staff to be friendly and professional - this included desk, bell, restaurant, bar, and housekeeping staff.  I also feel the hotel offers a very high value and would most certainly stay here again if returning to Dublin.  I would also recommend the Westin to friends and family",5,2013,03,09
202,Wonderful Hotel!,"This has got to be the BEST hotel I have ever stayed at.  This review is a bit over due because we stayed there back in May 2011, but in my defense I am new to Trip Advisor.  Although it has been well over a year since our stay, I still fondly remember how beautiful and welcoming the Georgian building was, how delighted I was with our room, especially the nice bathroom with a detachable shower head and the amazing breakfast we had each day.  The full Irish breakfast had an incredible selection of hot and cold items and it was a perfect to get us started on our day of exploring and sightseeing.  Not only was it delicious but they served a pot of freshly brewed coffee to your table and it was honestly the best coffee I've ever had!

We were only there for 4 days, so we felt pressed to get going and see everything.  Because of our schedule, we unfortunately did not have time to slow down and enjoy the afternoon tea (which I really wanted to do) nor the Mint bar, which sounds like a lot of fun.  So I look forward until the day we can return to stay at this lovely hotel.  Oh, and I can't forget to mention the staff.  They were all very polite, helpful and such a pleasure to deal with.  We needed some recommendations for restaurants one night and the very charming gentleman at the front desk was more than helpful.  The Westin in Dublin sets the standard for what hospitality and top notch accomodations should  be like and I can't wait to return  .",5,2013,03,08
202,Superb Customer Service,"We knew the hotel would be ideally located. We expected the Deluxe King room would be luxurious but the surprise was the standard of service. Every member of staff that we dealt with from Concierge, Express Service Agent(Receptionist to you and I), Waitress, Cocktail Bar Waiters and Chamber Maid were all  professional, helpful and genuinely friendly. The service was as good as any we have received anywhere in the world! We had a fantastic weekend in Dublin and we are so pleased we stayed at the Westin.",5,2013,03,07
202,Lovely hotel for a special occassion,"We stayed here for my 30th Birthday weekend....The hotel is perfect. It has everything and the rooms are really lovely. We had a deluxe room on the 4th floor. The atrium lounge is a very quiet relaxing lounge bar or you have the mint bar which is very lively....Good range of cocktails here. 
There is a small fitness suite with the latest technogym equipment.The gym has everything you need. Lots to do around Dublin including hop on hop off bus, Kilmainham Goal which is an old prision and definitly worth going too. The Guiness Factory was so busy when we went we didnt enjoy it sadly. 
One small complaint was the service at times in both bars was scatty...Could have been much better. 

Definitly recommened this hotel to anyone.

If you are thinking about this Hotel go and book it! ",4,2013,03,05
202,Lovely stay.,"Stayed here on a Saturday night. Slight problem at check in as staff initially were not aware of our booking. This was rectified and staff gave an apology. Room was lovely overlooking the atrium. It was however noisy until 1am as people were in the atrium and we could hear the noise in our room. Maybe other rooms would be quieter. Loved the Mint bar, it was always a favorite when I lived in Dublin and the cocktails are still as delicious as ever. Great band there on sat night also. Breakfast was really good. Great selection, everything you would want and more. The Belgian waffles were really tasty.",4,2013,03,04
202,Location and beds!!!,"I had read the reviews about the Westin, the few negative ones as well, and was curious what it would turn out to be. Well, I can honoustly say the Westin was a wonderfull experience! Location: hard to beat. Staff: very friendly and helpfull. And the beds, ahhh those wonderfull beds!!! We were in the Mint bar in the basement as well, and I had read a review complaining about the staff there. All I can say is that they were working hard and were friendly, no complaints whatsoever. There was free Wifi, in the lobby and restaurants but on my room as well. And it was quick enough. 
Is it worth the money? Well, in my opinion, Dublin as a city is overpriced, but that goes for pretty much anything. But all in all the Dublin Westin was one of my more pleasant experiences as a hotelguest.",5,2013,03,04
202,High calibre surroundings at a competitive price,"This hotel exudes comfort and serenity. Although the Westin is located in the centre of Dublin, it is imbued with great calm and peacefulness. I stayed here for about six nights in February at a room rate of Euro 145 a night. My deluxe room was located on the fourth floor and it boasted a great view over the rooftops of Trinity College and down the full length of Pearse Street. I slept like a dream there, cocooned in the large bed by the all-enveloping mattress and sheets which are designed to make life luxurious for weary travellers. Not being the slimmest person in the world, I was also impressed by the large bright bathroom with its capacious bath and separate shower with high-powered jets of water which woke me up rapidly in the mornings.

Despite negative murmurings in an earlier Tripadvisor review about the breakfasts, I could not fault them. I thought the Irish breakfast was excellent. (I suspect that some American travellers are simply not used to ""full on"" Irish breakfasts and this is why they are critical of them). And the coffee arrives at your table freshly brewed together with the freshest of orange juices. And for those guests who are not receptive to Irish breakfasts, there is a great selection of fruits, cheeses, meats and fish which will sate your collective appetites for food.  The breakfast room itself is a congenial and aesthetically pleasing place, where many of the business guests take the opportunity to unwind by having lighthearted conversations with their colleagues before facing the challenges of the working day.

For casual dining, there are two great locations in this hotel. The Atrium lounge which serves a selection of sandwiches and soups as well as great afternoon teas. It is difficult to beat the ambience of this location on a cold winter's afternoon when the rain lashes the glass roof overhead and you can take solace in the comfort of the armchairs situated just beside the warmth of a roaring fire. The Mint Bar, which is located in the basement of the hotel, serves a selection of tasty meat and fish dishes. When I ordered a gin and tonic there, the man in charge of the place talked me out of ordering Schweppes to mix with my Hendrix gin, introducing me instead to a couple of new herb-based tonics which have just been introduced to the market. I am grateful to him insofar as both of the new drinks (which I tried in separate G &Ts) added a huge zing to my Hendrix gin.

I liked this hotel so much I have booked another week's stay there in early April.",5,2013,03,03
202,Great location!,"We stayed at the Westin Dublin at the end of February 2013. The room with two single beds was spacious, clean, and comfortable. The bathroom was large and accommodating and included both a shower and large bath tub - a plus! We arrived much earlier than our check-in and although our room was not yet ready, reception happily held on to our bags and had them waiting in our room when we returned from sightseeing. The staff was extremely helpful throughout our stay!

If the staff and accommodation were excellent, the location was amazing. The Westin is situated right next to to Temple Bar, Dame Street, O'Connell Street and Trinity College. Everything that we wanted to see or do was in close walking distance. Museums, historical sites, restaurants, pubs, live music, shopping, and ATMs were all nearby - even the sightseeing tour buses met close by in the mornings. Amazingly, the Westin was always quiet and peaceful inside despite its central location!

We would definitely suggest the Westin Dublin as a great place to relax and enjoy the great city of Dublin.",5,2013,03,02
202,This has got to be the best Westin for a city break,"From the moment we arrived we felt welcome and it just got better and better particularly the 
Staff, who could not do enough for us to make us feel welcome and it was done and delivered in such a genuine caring way that we marked this up as a hotel we would definitely return to in the future.",5,2013,02,28
202,One of the best Westin's,"What's great about this place is first, the staff and then the fact it is in a cute original georgian building, which is very cosy and then of course the location. They have that featured glass atrium like so many of theirs do, although the one in Paris is hard to beat....Anyway beautifully appointed rooms, zero tolerance for smoking and if you get a room overlooking College green even better..
Very handy for the bus to the airport also which is right across the street. 
Afternoon tea with the music in the salon is lovely too especially when its pouring outside, fir lit, scones and tea and a lovely wine list too",5,2013,02,26
202,Fantastic,"Great location and so much character!
Love the live music on the weekends coming from the Mint bar, creates an excellent atmosphere in the reception area.
Staff very friendly.

Temple Bar 5 minwalk, excellent Thai resto just accross the street.",5,2013,02,26
202,Really friendly in perfect location.,"The Westin Dublin is a perfect location.  In fact it is in the most ideal location in Dublin.  Yards from Temple Bar and Trinity College and only a couple of blocks to Grafton Street, the Liffey and O'Connell St.  
The hotel is a beautiful conversion from a georgian bank.  Well done and somehow done so well it is now has a warm atmosphere.  Front desk staff are well trained and friendly.  The housekeeping staff is really outstanding. 
I only gave it a 4 because of the food standard.  One day I had the full Irish breakfast.  It was a fairly sad steam table affair.  Another, a continental breakfast, was some cereal and fruit but ruined by stale bread, croissants and probably the worst waffle I have ever tried.  
The bar in the basement is very pleasant and serves serviceable sandwiches etc.",4,2013,02,25
202,Right in the City Center,"A typical Westin experience--excellent room and excellent service.  The staff were particularly helpful in arranging transportation for us via planes, trains and automobiles as we were based in Dublin, but moving around the country for business.  Quiet, comfortable, beautifully appointed, and right in the city center, the Westin is an oasis just steps away from everything you'll want to experience in Dublin.  We've made a number of visits to the city for both business and pleasure, and the Westin is our Irish home.",5,2013,02,25
202,Friendly and accommodating,"Convenient location, friendly staff and outstanding concierge service (thanks Daragh!). My friend arrived very early in the morning, and despite the early hour, the staff was highly accommodating and flexible. Our room was quiet and the beds ridiculously comfortable. The wifi isn't quite up to par for a hotel this size and standard, but I believe it's about to be upgraded capacity wise. Thanks for a great stay!",5,2013,02,24
202,Best location in Dublin City Center,"Ideally  located, quick  check-in formalities, friendly and helpful  front desk personnel, nice room, the best location just few steps from Trinity collage and shopping area, sightseeing tour buses, tourist information center, cafes, restaurants.",5,2013,02,20
202,Perfect stay,"A lovely historic hotel experience. Our room was perfect and overlooked the Trinity College area. Quiet, extremely comfortable, beautifully furnished. Absolutely worth spending a bit more to stay here.",5,2013,02,18
202,"It's nice, but...","This is a nice hotel. It's clean, friendly and well situated (assuming you're not driving).

However, it's stuck somewhere around 2002 - back in an era when, for example, it was ok to charge guests ‚Ç¨6 for ONE HOUR of Internet access, which carries the disclaimer ""Internet is set for speeds up to 512k"".

This kind of failure to adapt to the times, in terms of value and service for money is symptomatic throughout the hotel.

Makes it difficult to use as a business hotel. That said, its proximity to Temple Bar means the business traveller probably isn't the target demographic anyway.

(but the rooms really are lovely)",3,2013,02,18
202,Hotel experience will never be the same...,"We had an excellent, excellent stay here in October 2012. Booked a deluxe room. The room overlooked Westmoreland street, with a view into the Temple Bar area. Wonderful lively view from the room, but quiet enough with the window closed.
The hotel is really ideally situated, shops, sights, everything nearby.
The room was perfect, very nice beds, alarm clock with iPod connector so we could even listen to our own music in the evening hours.

Can't comment on the dining as we went out every night for a bite to eat. While on the subject, I can recommend Gallaher & Co Bistro on D'Olier street, less than 5 minutes away from the hotel.

All in all, we had a very pleasant stay, we are now officially spoilt.
Sure, it is not the cheapest, but it is well worth the money. I would stay here again, definitely.",5,2013,02,18
202,Excellent Location,My husband and I were in Dublin for the Ireland v England rugby match and stayed here for 3 nights.  We were meeting friends for drinks and dinner elsewhere in the city and found this location was really good to walk to anywhere.  We were lucky to be given an upgraded room when we arrived and found ourselves in a rather large suite with good views which was very comfortable.  The staff were very helpful and friendly.,4,2013,02,18
202,"Amazing sleep, service and location","The Westin was a great experience. The room (131) is a bit on the small and dark side for a 5 star, but very nice and just perfect for a weekend stay.
The bed was amazing. You can feel that good money has been spent on them. 
My only complaint (which isn't really a complaint) is that the bathroom floor was really cold, so the hotel should consider adding an extra mat to the bathroom.",4,2013,02,18
202,5 star experience in a fabulous hotel,"The Exchange Restaurant, Atrium and Mint Bar have excellent menus, amazing cocktails and best of all are totally accessible .

202,FABULOUS! fabulous! FABULOUS!,"After spending one night in the Harding Hotel(I booked a budget friendly trip to Ireland with Rick Steves guidebook recommendations), my mother, 3 aunts and I decided to change hotels due to terrible, terrible beds. This was a first ever travel situation for us. Luckily, the Westin Dublin had availability and we moved in for the last week of the trip.  Of course,  this was an increase in travel expense and an exchange of charm for a chain, but it was so worth it. And due to the hurricane in New York(Oct 2012), our stay was extended 5 days and it was nice to be at the Westin. 

This hotel is beautiful and everything one would expect from a Westin. The staff is very helpful and friendly. We enjoyed tea each evening in the atrium, a really nice retreat after a day filled with touring.  The Westin is centrally located to everything, a walk to most of the sights and inexpensive taxi fares to all of the others.  Next time I go to Dublin, there is no doubt, I will stay here!",5,2013,02,16
202,Lovely hotel,"Stayed in February 2013 a lovely hotel, room only basis, breakfast expensive at 19.50 euro so passed on that. Subway across street. Exchange restaurant food was very good, but like all over temple bar area drinks were very expensive. Basic bottle of sauvignon was 27.50 euro! All things considered and as it was my birthday they left a plate with 2 pieces of cake and happy birthday card and happy birthday written in chocolate on the plate! Nice touch.  ",4,2013,02,16
202,Excellent Dublin location!,"Top notch hotel with every amenity in a perfect location.  Right across the street from the mouth of Temple Bar, moments from the O'Connell Bridge crossing the Liffey to the North and Trinity College to the South and Grafton Street beyond that.  I will definitely stay here again.",4,2013,02,14
202,The best hotel in Dublin,We stayed here for a long weekend the Hotel is perfectly located for shopping. The staff were very attentive and helpful and concierge were extremely efficient and knowledgable. Best pillows in Ireland. Hope to be back at Easter. ,5,2013,02,13
202,Solo Traveler in Dublin,Picked the Westin for its central location and gosh I picked very well.  The hotel was in the center of everything but very secure and with exceptional service.  The conceriege team directed me to tutorist and local finds.  Simply had a great time and everything was within reach.,4,2013,02,12
202,Superb Refurbishment,"Westin Hotlel was amazing, on the fourth floor you can still smell the new carpets. Luxurious rooms, very attentive staff that genuinely wanted and could help with any query. We were in a party of 10, everyone in our group loved the experience. The Hotel Bar is very sociable and had live Music which was of high quality.",5,2013,02,11
202,Picture perfect,"I usually do not stay in this kind of hotels because they are way above  my budget. But because of the SPG points I saved up I could afford this night. I used 13500 points for a deluxe room with a kingsize bed.

When we checked in I felt like the prince of the Netherlands . They nicely kept the doors open for us and were greeted by the doorman. They wanted to carry our bags to our room and asked if there was anything they could help us with. 

After a lovely check in and signing all the required papers, the room was ready for us at 13:00 pm. When walking to the elevator I had a good chance to look around. I loved the interior! What a luxury! Very old style 1700-1800 era. Like I was wandering through a secret department of trinity college decorated with beautiful old paintings. 

Our room had a lovely sideview of the campus grounds of trinity college and a full view of the old national bank building. It was a leisure trip so I did not really care for the old bureau but I can imagine that the deluxe room would be great for businesstravelers. I told the hotel it was for an anniversary. And to our surprise they left a little cake for me and my girlfriend with fresh fruit and two spoons along with a personal greeting card from the general manager. A really nice personal touch! 

We had dinner on wednesday night in the restaurant which was bring your own wine night. They even gave us a cooler for our bottle and we felt very welcome. The food was gorgeous looking and the lamb was very tasty. A feast for my tastebuds. After a zombie cocktail ( which is REALLY strong! You are not allowed to take more then two!) in the bar downstairs which rocked my socks off I felt lightheaded and went upstairs. 
I slept like a baby in the bed which was probably the best bed I ever slept in.

All in all this was a great expierence provided by the lovely staff and hotel. I wouldn't reccommend it when you are on a budget, but for a nice weekend in dublin this is the place to go to feel like a royal.",5,2013,02,09
202,Good location and lives up to Westin brand,"Great location that is walking distance to a multitude of restaurants.  High-quality rooms and good service.  

My only tip... Have breakfast across the street at the coffee shop and save yourself a nice sum.",4,2013,02,03
202,Nice hotel.,"Nice hotel, good location, staff nice, food nice in the hotel, breakfast yummy. Only fault towels are not big enough, hand towels tand bath towels are tiny.  Air con/heating must get turned on at 6am every morning in the hotel, stayed two nights and both mornings this work us. ",4,2013,02,01
202,A class hotel!,"Excellent experience, superb customer service. Staff were so helpful. Dinner at the exchange restaurant was delicious. Would def recommend. Beautiful hotel and rooms are very comfortable! Centrally located, close to everything. ",5,2013,02,01
202,Questionable 5* standards,"My expectations for this hotel were based on review readings & many stays in Westin hotels, however I remain perplexed as to the hotel management decisions.
The music from the downstairs bar/disco/band is completely open to the hotel foyer & beautiful atrium lounge & upon inspection/ visit was more like a cheap bar/disco with questionable guests! The noise was awful throughout the hotel both Thursday & Friday until the early hours of the morning - even in our hotel room! The comings and goings of questionably attired visitors is a far cry from a 5* Westin hotel - a visit to the ladies was memorable! My husband was shocked at the language and clothing both in the hotels restaurant, lobby and bar. The only sanctuary for hotel guests was the atrium lobby upstairs although the music could still be heard! I was somewhat surprised to find my husband waiting outside the ladies here - my safety being his concern! The atrium glass ceiling was leaking onto very slippery marble flooring adjacent to the fireplace ( known to the staff apparently). I feel Gin & Tonic nights etc in order to make as much money as possible ruin the reputation of this hotel and undermine excellent staff.",3,2013,01,31
202,The Best of the Best,"I am a business travel and I stay in several dozen different hotels each year. The Westin Dublin is my favorite hotel in the world, bar none. It is elegant, sophisticated, and stylish, preserving the boutique feeling of it's Georgian heritage complemented alongside the exceptional service that you expect from the Westin brand. Every room in the hotel is different, with views of Trinity College or the spectacular city centre right on your doorstep. The suites are a particular treat - some are bi-level and have indescribable views. The food is standard Westin fare (delicious as always) and the service really is first class - Irish hospitality with an international reputation for excellence.",5,2013,01,26
202,Perfect stay for Business,"This hotel is perfect for a stay during your business trip. When you arrive at this hotel you are always well received by the front desk. Rooms are excellent, well equipped. As a Spg platinum member they mostly grade you up to a jun.- or suite. If you just want to do some shopping after work or have a nice dinner in the city the location is great. Also you do not to wait for a taxi always available and public transport is in front of the Hotel. Again if you need to be only for business in the city this is perfect place to be.",5,2013,01,25
202,Great help when our luggage was lost.,"We checked into two rooms at the Westin Dublin in late December before the Christmas holiday. My son's suitcase was lost by AerLingus. He was given a claim form and a website to check and a phone number to call. I could have easily spent the rest of the afternoon trying to get to the bottom of it, but we planned to see some sights. I took the claim form to the Westin Concierge and he made a photocopy of the form and said he would look it up online and also try to reach them on the phone. While we didn't get the bag until three days later (guess that's a story for another review...) I was impressed with their willingness to help out and to follow up on the issue. 

The rest of the staff was great and the location (right next to Trinity and a short walk from Grafton Street and Temple Bar) was outstanding. The hotel had some very festive decorations too.

We had two rooms, one overlooking the atrium and one overlooking Trinity. As we were only there one night, the atrium room view didn't bother us, but if you're there for an extended time (or time of year when it is lighter later) you may want to go for an exterior view.",5,2013,01,23
202,Great place: Ross & Ahmed are the best concierges in town!,"Lovely rooms & great location. Nothing was too much trouble for the fabulous concierges Ross & Ahmed. We particularly like that Ross demonstrated his passion for juggling for us! 
The only snag was that the trainee concierge messed up a restaurant reservation so we ended up waiting for an hour to eat. 
Otherwise, as very pleasant experience.",4,2013,01,23
202,Writer's Junior Suite,"Having stayed at the Westin Dublin a couple of years back at a Deluxe Room, we thought it would be nice to return as a Christmas treat. We found a special offer - book a suite, get 10 % off, breakfast and 3000 bonus points, when you are member of Starwood‚Äôs loyalty program, plus a welcome gift.

The Westin is located opposite Trinity College and the Bank of Ireland. The nearest Airlink Stop is College Green. From there the hotel is only around 200 m away. It is housed in a former bank building and was opened in 2001 by Mary Harney, the then T√°naiste and Health Minister.

When entering there is a foyer. At the end of the foyer and to the left is the Exchange Bar and Restaurant. When entering the lobby, there is a stair case on the right, leading to the Atrium Lounge, an open fire place with seating area and to the left the concierge and reception.

As the name of the Atrium lounge implies it has a very beautiful atrium and is my favorite place in the hotel.

In the basement is the Mint Bar - it's the former bank vault with the bar island in the center and tables placed around it. They serve some mean cocktails and snacks.

Our check in was quick, and after asking for a late check out at 2 PM it was granted after a short moment of hesitation. When inquiring what the welcome amenity would be, we were told it was either Baileys or Jameson Whiskey. Since we liked both it wasn't a problem.

There are some new room types at the Westin, like Writer's rooms and suites - named after a famous Irish author. Ours was located on the third floor and called Brian O'Nolan Writer's Junior Suite. When entering there was a small foyer with two double doors leading to the bathroom on the left and the bedroom to the right.

A few steps led up to the living room. We were surprised by the large size of the living room and that there was no wall between the bed and living room, only a balustrade. We also had a small terrace with two chairs and a table. It gave amazing views over Trinity College. There was a small barrier between our part of the terrace and the neighboring room's, giving some privacy.

The bedroom was medium in size with loads of storage space for clothing, the safe, a king sized bed and a medium sized TV, providing all international news and business channels needed. Sports was also covered with Sky Sports 1 to 3 and ESPN.

There were also regional channels. The Heavenly Bed was very comfortable, and we had a good nights rest. The furniture was contrasting with dark and light colors. The same color scheme continued in the living room. There was a huge sofa, coffee table with books by Brian O'Nolan (It's not recommended to take them with you, because there is a charge of 30 Euro applicable if you do), a writing desk and a huge TV.

Unfortunately that flat screen TV didn't get any signal. It didn't matter, because we were there to spend time together. Below the TV was a credenza, containing the minibar. A short background information about the author was also given and hanging on the wall beside the writing desk. There was also a chair with an ottoman. The carpet was very beautifully decorated too. A large photograph hung above the sofa, depicting a sea scape. There was also some other artwork placed in the bed and bathroom. We spent a lot of time on the sofa and testing also the writing desk and chair with ottoman. Everything was comfortable and the fabrics used very soft.

The bathroom had a shower over bathtub combination, a toilet, scales and a sink. There were also Heavenly Spa amenities including mouthwash. The bath tub was comfortable, the water pressure very good and no fluctuations in water temperature.

When I requested an additional soap and mouthwash we received two complete amenity sets only a few minutes later.

When our welcome gift arrived we were in for another surprise. Instead of receiving simply the whiskey or the Baileys, we got both including nuts and truffles. When we thought that was it, room service returned with a cheese board and a bottle of wine.

Since we know the restaurant, bar and lounge already and frequent the last two regularly we didn't use them during our stay.

We had in room dining instead. Our late lunch consisted of fish from the Superfoods RX menu, pasta with chorizo, fruit salad and an unexpected sticky toffee pudding, which hasn't been charged. We also had a bottle of still water, juice and a Rush Hour (cocktail) for my better half. The cocktail hadn't been on the menu, but when I asked the person from in room dining, if I could also order it, it was no problem at all. The meal was very delicious.

Later we felt slightly peckish and had the tomato soup and again fruit salad.

Because breakfast was included in our rate, we had the option to choose between the buffet at the Exchange Restaurant or anything from the in room dining menu. We choose the latter. Both of us had the Healthy Breakfast with oatmeal.

In room spa treatments were also available.

The time passed way too quickly and before we knew it was already 2 PM. The check out was efficient and warm.

We felt after our stay relaxed, happy and totally spoiled.

Every member of staff was very friendly, efficient and knowledgeable. Besides the space, design and comfort of the suite, we loved the can do attitude of the staff and would return in a heart beat.",5,2013,01,22
202,Good Hotel,"Excellent rooms,good food and water. Very good conference rooms and facilities. Very good stay overall and pleasing memories of stay.Centrally located with all public transport accessable, shopping and university in close proximity.",5,2013,01,21
202,Excellent visit,"We stayed recently in the Westin with our brood was slightly apprehensive but I didn't need to be, wonderful welcome at check in little step for smallest to stand on really nice touch! And what can I say about the atrium just fantastic especially Michelle gave us the recipie for the amazing gin Mojito in the most peculiar afternoon tea yum! Will definitely be back.",5,2013,01,17
202,Beautiful hotel,"The other reviews sum up the convenient location so I thought I'd concentrate on the hotel!

Our first impressions were great as reception upgraded us to a refurbished Deluxe Room which was really beautiful, extremely spacious and nicely decorated. Some luxury hotels can feel quite cold and uniformed but this hotel really had something extra. The bathroom was huge with a large separate bath and shower which is something I do look for in a hotel.

The staff were acommodating throughout our stay - I fancied a chair massage and although they were fully booked, they called someone from their sister spa in Temple Bar to come over which I really appreciated. We were also impressed by the Atrium Lounge and were served lovely tea and complimentary biscuits. I think the essence of this hotel is that although it is large, you do feel special and the little extra touches make all the difference.

The 'heavenly bed' really was heavenly and it made all the difference after a heavy night out in Temple Bar.

The Westin has everything you want from a luxury city hotel and it is good value for money. I felt really relaxed by the end of my stay and I would have no hesitation booking here again on my next visit to Dublin. I also would seriously think about booking another Westin hotel in another country.

Thank you very much!",5,2013,01,16
202,Must stay,"My fiance and I stayed at this hotel over New Years 2010-2011.  The facility was clean, professional, and courteous.  The location is within walking distance to all of the action packed areas of Dublin like temple bar and Grafton st.  The hotel has an onsite restaurant and bar which is really nice.  You are also within walking to tour offices which you can sign up for day trips to all over Ireland.  We  opted for the West coast day tour which was a lot of fun.  We also toured Guinness and Jameson factories- A must do.  A+ hotel.  Wouldn't hesitate to stay again.",5,2013,01,16
202,Keeps refreshing and getting better!,"It wasn't bad but they pre-emptively just renovated the gym now with all new equipment very nice!!

Rooms are fresh, good room service and great staff!

Food and drinks at Mint bar excellent...staff remembers you and oes above and beyond to make your stay terrific.",5,2013,01,15
202,Westin in Dublin--Great Hotel,The Westin is in a great location in Dublin.  It is right across the street from the Temple Bar District and down the street from Trinity University and Grafton Street Shopping.  The rooms were wonderful and the beds were so comfy!  The service was great--from the bar to the front desk.  We also visited The Mint Bar inside the hotel and it was wonderful as well.,5,2013,01,12
202,Great location and service,"The Westin is situated in the middle of Dublin and is in walking distance to most attractions. ¬† The staff if very helpful and ¬†welcoming. ¬† The room ¬†(an upgraded room for a SPG member) was rooomy for two and comfertable. ¬†The bathroom was spacious .¬†

Price was around ‚Ç¨170 per night for two w/o breakfast. ¬† ",4,2013,01,12
202,Location couldn't be better.,"Surely everybody is writing about the location but its just bang on in the middle of the city. You can roll into the famous temple bar area and Graffton street shopping yet there is no noise in the rooms. 
Rooms are in average not too large but I guess once you here you don't stay much in your room anyway. Bathroom is clean and sufficient. I always liked walked across to the Trinity college and enjoy the student buzz and lovely gardens. Didn't have breakfast since I had to leave early but wanted to mention the friendly staff at the reception. Small but high quality gym on the first floor, they have also local maps and water if you want to run outside. 
Good 5 star choice for Dublin. ",5,2013,01,12
202,An excellent hotel with even better staff,"We visited the Westin for our honeymoon over the new year. The location of the hotel is perfect, with a short walk to shops, bars ans restaurants but not at all hectic. First impressions count for a lot, and from the moment we arrived we were offered efficient and friendly service. The lobby is extremely impressive, also the Mint Bar and Atrium are beautiful spaces. 

Our room was extremely well fitted, and the beds really are as comfortable as I'd heard.  I loved the deep bath and spacious shower. We enjoyed the Very Peculiar Afternoon Tea, something really not to be missed. Exquisite! We also saw 2013 in The Mint Bar which has a wicked selection of cocktails.

The staff at The Westin are without exceptional outstanding. There was always a friendly smile and genuine desire to assist. Staff clearly take a great deal of pride in their hotel and in the service that they offer. As a newlywed one if the nicest things was to be addressed by my new name by staff.  

We hit small niggles during our stay, but if this happens to you, give these guys the chance to fix things. Duty Manager Ursula should be singled out for her customer care. We plan on visiting Dublin again soon, specifically to return to The Westin. Thank you so much for a lovely honeymoon.",5,2013,01,11
202,Fantastic Experience,"We stayed here over Christmas break, not realizing that most things would be closed. Daragh called around to different restaurants to find us reservations for Christmas dinner and the rest of the staff made our time at the Westin a very memorable experience.",5,2013,01,10
202,Beautiful hotel in the heart of Dublin - definately 5 star,"Travelled in September and although from the outside you cant tell anything, the hotel as you go in is pristine throughout - beautiful rooms and bathrooms.  Close and within walking distance to everywhere you need or want to go to in Dublin.",5,2013,01,10
202,Brilliant service,"What great efficient and customer friendly staff, lovely food (steak just melts in your mouth) and wonderful atmosphere. A cool place for a lunch or early evening drink. Central location, welcoming staff, lovely decor, perfect",5,2013,01,08
202,Excellent!,"we stayed here during Christmas and the staff was very helpful and accomodating. We got a very good room, spacious and the bathroom was big!. Breakfast buffet was also good. It is centrally located so most sights are within walking distance. Would surely stay again.",4,2013,01,07
202,Westin Dublin,"Location was excellent. Dublin Airport Coach stops directly opposite the hotel. Hotel is located within walking distance from major shopping outlets, pubs & restaurants. Hotel check in staffs were very helpful & informative. Provided us with an upgrade complimentary to SPG gold member. Room stayed in was excellent. Space was spacious, clean & a very comfortable bed. Toilet was immaculate, clean & big. iPod docking station was also provided in room.",5,2013,01,06
202,Great Hotel,Great stay at a great hotel. Central to everything and the service was amazing. Room was plush and the bathroom was spacious. Great hotel for our anniversary trip to Dublin. The breakfast buffet was delicious.,5,2013,01,04
202,Amazing service,"I know it's a late review but it's a must as it's not about one single stay and experience but about consistency. 
I had 57 stays & 142 nights at the Westin Dublin from 2008 to 2010 for business and I have never been disappointed. Great location in the heart of the city, near the bars and shops, great rooms and good food. I loved the Mint bar - amazing Mojitos there and decent food too. The staff was amazing and really looked after me every single time. Multiple room upgrades, basket of fruits in the room, handwritten letters. I even ordered room service that was not on the menu and they always tried to accomodate...they had it right every single time and really knew how to make people feel special. They never let me down a single time. 
Only downside to this hotel is a good gym (theirs is really really small) and no swimming pool/steam room/sauna.",5,2013,01,02
202,Terrific location and service,"The room was very comfortable, and the location was perfect!  Our room overlooked Trinity College and it was an easy walk to Grafton Street.  The staff was very helpful, and directed us to a great restaurant in town.  We had great WIFI reception available, which was rare on our trip, but much appreciated at the Westin!  

I am a celiac and have to eat gluten-free... the only note I might make for the staff is to be sure to keep gluten-free bread away from the regular bread when bringing breakfasts up to the room.  They were mixed together the second morning, which made the gluten-free bread useless to me due to cross-contamination.",5,2013,01,01
202,Superb Service,"For the past few years I have gone for Afternoon Tea over the Christmas in the Westbury but this year we decided to try somewhere new.  The whole experience in The Atrium was excellent, super sandwiches, scones and cakes.  This super food was matched by super service.  
After such an enjoyable Afternoon Tea experience we decided to book a table in The Atrium for a celebratory drink when my brother got engaged last week.  Once again the service couldn't be faulted.  There were two seperate tables reserved for us to choose from and from the moment we arrived till when we left the Atrium staff were fantastic.  Thanks to all at The Westin for making such a special occasion all the more special!
We will definitely be back!!",5,2012,12,30
202,"Great place to stay, perfect location!","In January 2012 my fiance and I stayed at the Westin Dublin for three nights. We received a nice upgrade to a junior suite at check-in. Staff was exceptionally friendly and accomodating. We even had one of their employees go get us a bunch of things from a drugstore late at night, which were promptly delivered to our room. The suite was very nice with a large bathroom that included both a bathtub and a shower. The king size bed was comfortable, all the electrical equipment one would need were in the room. Nothing we would have missed! 

To sum up: Outstanding service, convenient location, definitely a place to recommend!",5,2012,12,30
202,Great business stay at the Westin,This hotel is every bit as good as the other reviews on here suggest. My room was spacious and luxuriously appointed and I had a good night's sleep in the very comfy bed. Staff were friendly and efficient. The location was central and I was able to walk to the majority of my meetings from the hotel. A great hotel and I will look to stay here again next time I am in Dublin.,5,2012,12,29
202,Lovely stay,"We stayed in a Deluxe Suite for a weekend during the summer. The room was beautifully decorated, clean and bed was comfortable. It had a spiral staircase leading to a separate living/study with a nice big television. Staff were excellent and very accommodating. Definitely will stay there again sometime!",5,2012,12,29
202,Wonderful!!!,"These people are great. The staff most accommodating (especially Sam the concierge). Gorgeous rooms, good food, amazing service. Cannot brag enough about them. Didn't have to touch our bags or move the car ourselves. Lovely, lovely experience. We were there 2 nights.",5,2012,12,28
202,Nice location well trained staff,"Very good located Hotel, with well trained staff who make you feel home, they pay attention to every need. I went in a difficult time, being that Christmas and even tough is hard to work on that days the staff was very kind and polite and all the services of the hotel worked wonderfully.",5,2012,12,27
202,Avoid at all costs.,"Stayed here about 8 weeks ago. (That's how long I have been waiting for someone to get back to me about my complaint, still waiting!!) When we arrived at the hotel we first went in to find out where we could park the car for the night. Excellent service here. As the westin staff took my car keys and kindly parked my car. Went to check in. Very slow. Allot of running back and forth to an office in the rear. 

We were staying here as we were going to a concert. So when we eventually got our room key we  left our bags in room and hurried off into Dublin. 

We didn't return to late. By this time we were tired and just wanted to sleep. When we got into bed the covers were on upside down. However we were so tired we didn't bother turning them (thank god) and just went to sleep. 

The next morning whilst getting ready to Ho for breakfast I noticed something on the underside of the upside down cover - it was BLOOD, and it didn't belong to either of us!!!! 

We went down for breakfast. We waited a while at the desk to be seated. When the man came to seat us he asked for our room number. I gave him the room number and informed him as he scanned the list that we were booked ""room only"" and that he should add the cost of breakfast to our room. 

We were seated and off I went to help myself at the buffett. It was nearly finishing time for breakfast and I have to say this was evident by the lack of food and drink left. I had to ask for pure juice and eggs. 

Whilst I was eating my breakfast, a rather flamboyant young waiter came over to the table clutching our bill and loudly informed us that ""in actual fact"" breakfast was not included in our room. So loudly that the neighbouring tables stopped to listen. At this point I had to defend myself and tell him that I had already told him this. 

After breakfast we went straight to our room to collect out belongings and go. 

When we got to reception we were produced with the room account. Breakfast was there. Along with a parking charge of ‚Ç¨25 for the night. I imagine that on a square inch basis the car paid more to stay than me. I am a frequent stayer at the Conrad where parking is ‚Ç¨10 per night. 

We told the receptionist all about our complaints. He may as well have been somewhere else as he stood staring into space repeating the words ""I'll pass that on"". 

He then arranged for our car to be brought back. We were told they were busy and this may take 15 minutes. However, soon we were produced with the keys of a shiny new BMW. Lovely. However I own a three year old shogun. 

This place is a disaster. I complained at reception - no response. Then I posted my complaints on their Facebook page - they deleted it  

Do yourselves a favour. Try the Conrad folks. 

Oh. And.  I think someone else has already pointed this out. They charged us extra for a ""city view"" it's a block of cheap shops and a bus stop across the street.",2,2012,12,26
202,Liked this hotel!,"Great location for bus to and from airport, walking distance to Trinity College, Grafton Street for Shopping, National Gallery of Arts, Natural History Museum, and the Tram. Lots of good restaurants, and shops all close by. Fantastic city location to start and end your time in Dublin. What a great city! I was upgraded to a suite, 530, facing the interior of the building, but super quiet, and great for sleeping. This is a class hotel.....oh, nice area for tea and food on downstairs.",5,2012,12,24
202,"Location, Location, Location","Did I mention Location?  Westin sits (in our opinion) close to everything.  Me and my girlfriend visited in March 2012 and it was a pleasure to stay here. From check in to check out, we felt like VIP's.  

I booked us a suite and when we go back to visit Ireland, I will do it again. The suite was very spacious and luxurious.  Even through emails, the staff at Westin helped me out with surprise flowers for my girlfriend placed throughout the room, champagne and everything else to make it special.  They responded very quickly to all my emails and phone calls.  Service is top notch!

As I said before, we were within everything we wanted to do, from restaurant hopping, Temple Bars and the tour buses.  I can't say enough about this place, I would highly suggest it to anyone who passes through Dublin!",5,2012,12,23
202,"Nice hotel, great location","We stayed here last weekend as we were heading to a concert in the O2. The location is outstanding, mid- way between Grafton Street and Henry Street. However we were a little disappointed not to get a newly refurbished deluxe room. Also after checking in at 12.45am our bags did not reach our room until 5.30pm that evening and we had to ring down for them. Breakfast was nice albeit that it was a buffet and a lot of the hot trays were more or less empty when we arrived down at 9.40am. We would suggest to the hotel to remove the long table with the big plant in the Exchange restaurant which was causing an obstruction to guests and staff who were trying to get by the buffet counter. But all in all we did like the hotel and the heavenly beds are really comfortable.",4,2012,12,20
202,Wonderful stay,"Just returned from our trip to Dublin.  We stayed at the Westin and were glad we chose it.  First, the location is absolutely wonderful.  Close to Trinity College, Temple Bar, shopping, sightseeing, etc.  The staff were all friendly, from those at reception and the concierge to the waiters and bartenders.  Our room was on the 3d floor with a view of Trinity.  The bed was truly ""heavenly""-the shower was on the small side, but manageable.  The hotel was beautifully decorated for Christmas. We will stay there again on our next trip.",5,2012,12,19
202,excellent location but.....,"My husband and I stayed here last friday night and this was our second time staying at this hotel however our experience was not 5*.

As i said location is excellent. We arrived after 5pm and the car park was full so we parked in fleet st car park (‚Ç¨18 overnight which is reasonable) There was no conceigre on check in and we were not offered help with our bags at any stage.

However check in was efficient and staff were very nice.

After arriving in our room 443 we noticed the TV wasnt working so we reported this to the front desk and they said they would sent the duty manager right away. We had dinner reservations so waited 10 minutes but no one arrived. 
On return from dinner around 9pm TV had not been fixed so I reported it again and it was fixed within 15 minutes. but the maintenance man said initial fault had never been passed onto maintenace-hardly 5* service.

We also had mould growth on our shower-so not 5* cleaning!!

But the worst part of our stay was the extremely loud music (from bar in hotel) which kept us awake until 2am. We reported this at 11.30pm and were told it would be turned down but it wasnt. On check out we were told we would be allocated a quiet room on our next stay but I would be very reluctant to return to this hotel. We have stayed in other 5* hotels in Dublin and this is cerainly not up there with the best.

there was a good choice of food at breakfast but the cooked breakfast left alot to be desired-undercooked sausages and puddings and bland/tasteless scrambled egg. also no brown/wholemeal/soda bread. when i asked for some I was brought a multi grain roll!!!
Service was also very poor with our dishes not cleared for 15 minutes at one stage and the restaurant wasnt busy.

On a positive note rooms were nicely decorated and beds were very comfortable and the lobby area is nice but thats it im afraid.",3,2012,12,17
202,A Real Hotel,"We arrived four hours ahead of check-in expecting a  lengthy wait before our room would be ready but this was not the case . From the second we arrived at the hotel  i had a good feeling,a very friendly gentleman took our bags and guided us to the reception where we were checked in immediately by a very  efficient young lady.
We had a beautiful room on the fourth floor with wonderful views. The room was immaculate with a classic design and had an airy feel, no clutter.
We attended a function on the same night in a fantastic banquet hall. The staff were excellent as was the food.
The location is perfect and close to some wonderful landmarks, grafton street,o connell st, trinity college to name but a few.

The only negative think I have to add is that we did not have enough time to enjoy this fantastic hotel.

We will definitely be back.",5,2012,12,16
202,Warm and welcoming hotel in a great location.,"I had the pleasure of staying in this hotel on Friday night. The staff at check in were courteous, very friendly and helpful. The room was very tastefully decorated and had everything we needed. I particularly liked the music system and the tea and coffee facilities provided were excellent. There was a great atmosphere in the bar where we sampled some excellent cocktails. The bed and bedding was so comfortable I would love to have taken it home with me! ",5,2012,12,16
202,a very nice hotel,"This is a nice hotel in a central location in Dublin.  The staff are very helpful and the service is excellent.  i had a beautiful room but the heat was not on when I went to the room and it took quite a while for it to warm up.  This was on a very cold winters day.  It took a long time for the bathroom to get warm.  The beds are, as the Westin describe, just heavenly.  Breakfast was very nice and in general the food was very good.",4,2012,12,14
202,Great Boutique Hotel with Old World Charm,"Check in was warm and quick. The hotel has done a brilliant job combining the old and new to make a terrific experience. My room had an amazing balcony with a terrific view. The room had beautiful furnishings, a well thought out bathroom and of course the heavenly bed. Definitely will use them again.",5,2012,12,12
202,A1 service!,My friend and l called into the above hotel yest evening around 6.30pm for a quick drink while I was waiting for the coach home to limerick.we approached the bar and was greeted by a young friendly barman with a happy disposition.he served us our drinks and complementary bites.shortly thereafter my friend got a fit of coughing from swollowing a nut to fast.our friendly barman seeing my friend in distress rushed to get her a glass of water when I asked him.i can see our barman going a long way in the industry with the right attitude.,5,2012,12,10
202,"Great, comfortable stay in Dublin","The Westin is a well located very comfortable smallish 5 star hotel in Dublin. The room was great, plenty of space to move around and put stuff.  The beds at all the Westin's I have stayed in have been great.  This one was no exception.

The staff were good and friendly, well presented and helpful.  

The location is great, right next to Temple Bar and close to O'Connell street.

Breakfasts were good and filling, however I did not have any other meals there so cannot comment on those.  There are too many options nearby to eat at.

Overall I greatly enjoyed my visit to Dublin.  First time there in 25 years.  My stay at the Westin made it all the more memorable.",5,2012,12,06
202,Wonderful Westin!,"The only problem with the Westin is that the beds are so comfortable you will not want to get up! Girlfriend and I spent two fabulous nights here - it is just perfect. Staff are super friendly, lobby decor was just gorgeous, and our room was wonderful - we could people watch all night. Location is just great - walked to the Irish Film Institute the first night and took in a play at The Gate the second night. We'll be back again....and again.",5,2012,12,03
202,Perfect stay,"Got upgraded to a wonderful suite, notwithstanding some construction work in the parking garage and not having booked a spot they accommodated my rental car, very courteous staff, good breakfast.
The place is kind of homely.
The Spa and Gym are currently being rebuilt.",5,2012,12,03
202,Such an upscale and beautiful hotel,We spent our final night in Dublin at the Westin.  We were all impressed . .only negative is that the room was really warm.  Otherwise it was perfect.  Recently renovated and looks awesome.  Plus the location is incredible .. two blocks and right in Temple Bar!  My parents had dinner and said it was great and we all agreed that it was the best breakfast of our week long trip to Ireland.,4,2012,12,02
202,A+ location,"We were especially pleased with the Westin having stayed at two other properties on previous visits to Dublin.  The location was fantastic and couldn't be beat.  The hotel was also decorated for the Christmas holidays which made it even more charming.  The bellman was especially friendly and I looked forward to seeing him every morning.  Our room was spacious and quite lovely and the bed was very comfortable.  The only minor issue is that we were able to hear the ""sexy time"" noises from the people staying in the room next door.  Their bed springs were comically noisy and need a serious greasing.  All in all, I can't wait to go back to the Westin!",4,2012,12,02
202,Overpriced,"Firstly the location is excellent ,I should know I live in Dublin ,the entrance and lobby is very non descript ,featureless.the rooms are ok clean and a standard you'd expect from a five star hotel.Bar very expensive,ordered breakfast was an extra 40 euro all in all for one night with two drinks and breakfast 280euro ,a lot better value to be had out there and better quality I feel ,but for location great.",3,2012,12,01
202,A very Peculiar Afternoon Tea,"I was treated to A very Peculiar Afternoon Tea on Saturday afternoon at The Westin. A Victorian Mojito served in a beautiful china teapot (Hendrix Gin) The food arrived on 3 black slates balanced on a stainless steel frame, which looked amazing! Prawn cheek on a silver spoon in Stilton Aioli, Prawns in a Charcoal Cone, Spiced Roast Beef Wrap, Oak Smoked Salmon with Caviar Cream a wicked Black Olive Tepenade with Goats Cheese, Walnut & Banana Bread, Tarragon Cookie with White Chocolate & Lime Ganache, Popping Marshmallows, Fragipane Tart, Toffee Popcorn Crumble & a Chocolate & Sea Salt Brownie. The flavours were stunning! I could talk about this for day's! Service immaculate, surroundings in the Atrium second to none. If you want to impress someone this year or anytime this is the one. Amazeballs!!",5,2012,11,28
202,No free wifi,"A nice hotel centrally located but the rooms were quiet. The bedroom was a good size (and the bathroom had a great shower) and had everything you'd expect other than free wifi. 15 EUR for 24 hours.

If you step outside the hotel there is free Wifi all around and not sure why a supposedly good hotel could not provide the same.

I found it unusual that housekeeping didn't replace the shampoo & shower gel bottles but turned them upside down. The shampoo was terrible and left my hair in a mess (and my hair is not fussy about products normally) so if I go to a Westin again I would bring shampoo with me. With the limitations on liquids on flights the toiletries provided by hotels has become more important and they are often poor quality. I don't know why hotels don't just get Dove or similar brands and offer those.

Mint Bar had well trained staff who made a great cocktail. Food was so-so",3,2012,11,25
202,Gin and Jazz Thursdays,Myself and a few work friends recently enjoyed a lovley night in the company of Cary Posavitz and his band in the Mint Bar.  The music was excellent and it made for a most enjoyable night! I would recommend it as a nice night out to enjoy great music in a lovely venue!,5,2012,11,23
202,Great location,"My room was beautiful and even though I had a window looking down into an interior banquet hall where a wedding or some event was taking place, I couldn't hear any noise. The hotel's location is great. It is right beside Trinity College and a very short walk to the Temple Bar area and Grafton Street for shopping.",5,2012,11,20
202,Westin Westin Westin,Consistent Westin experience at a great location in the heart of a wonderful city.  The staff were very helpful and accommodating.  Five minutes walk to Trinity College and right next to Temple Bar.  They hotel allowed us to check in early which was greatly appreciated coming from the USA with a 2 year old who hadn't slept on the flight.  Room service was good.,4,2012,11,19
202,"Location, location, location","Your best location in Dublin for a Luxury Hotel.  You are in front of the Temple bar and the University.  Every buss stop in the fron of the hotel.  The staff is London friendly.  If you speak Spanish, look for the staff tha comes from Spain, you are going to have a blast with all of them.  Room are spacious (not the clasic small european room). We arrive early morning and they were very diligent to acomodate us.  Nightime walking around the hotel is a must. My only other choice is staying in a castle.  ",5,2012,11,18
202,Ideally located luxury hotel in Dublin,Very accommodating hotel with easy access to Dublin centre. Rooms are spacious and very clean. Ideally located and walking distance to conference centre. Lots of easy accessible entertainment within walking distance. Staff are very smart and professional and nothing is too much trouble.,5,2012,11,13
202,Spot On!,"This hotel is in a perfect location for exploring Dublin. We stayed over for an international ruby game at the Aviva stadium which we walked to from the hotel (about 35min walk). 
 
The service was good and we arrived on Saturday morning at around 12H00. Although check in is only at 15H00, we explained to the reception staff that we just landed after being on a flight all night and was very tired. The rugby game started at 17H00 and we had to get sum shut eye before the match or else we would not have made it. The bloke at reception did everything to try and get us into a room quickly. The hotel was fully booked and my father and I booked a twin deluxe room witch there are only a few of in the hotel. He phoned the cleaners to get the room cleaned and available a.s.a.p. We were in our room 20 minutes later! Excellent customer service as not many hotels would do this. 
We stayed in room 139 witch is big and roomy. Everything in the room(air-con, remotes, coffee machine, hair dryer etc) worked perfectly. The best part of the stay was the comfy beds and beautiful marble bathroom. 
 
We ate in the bar downstairs and both our meals were good! Breakfast the next morning was a treat as well and had everything you would expect from a 5star hotel. 
 
I feel that this was reasonably prised and would definitely return on my next visit to Dublin.",5,2012,11,12
202,superb hotel great position,"My wife and I stayed on Saturday night Sunday morning as we went down from the North for the Rugby .This is a truly excellent Hotel with really good staff who are both considerate and pleasant and not in an artificial way.I would highly recommend this establishment to anyone.The vallet parking was really good and highly efficient,the breakfast was great with top ups of fresh orange juice.Nothing was too much trouble.The room was emaculate and crisply clean.The bed was fit for a king and extremely comfortable,the headboard was something from a palacial mansion,really great!!The position of the Hotel is really what makes it so good ,you are two minutes walk from the entrance gate to Trinity and four minutes from the Dart to Landsdowne(Aviva)or a stones throw from the Hotel to the GPO in O Connell st.You are four minutes from Brown Thomas on Grafton Street which suits the wife of course!I have no negatives except one drunken Armagh man who let himself down a bucket full in front of his really embarrassed girl friend in the lift by rambling in a drunken state about something sexual.I could not blame this on the Hotel.Thankfully I never set eyes on this mupet again.",5,2012,11,12
202,"Wedding: Very happy with choice of Westin, Dublin","We had our weddiing at The Westin in September '12 and were very happy with the service and attention to detail before, during and after the day. The Westin's wedding co-ordinator Brigitte was fantastic  in the run up as were all the staff on the day. The food was of a very high quality and was served punctually (which is often a challange at weddings) . The room itself ( The Banking Hall) is one of the nicest in Dublin and added a huge amount the the day.

We stayed at The Westin for three nights and found the service excellent on a day to day basis also. Thanks again to The Westin Team.

Adrian & Katie",5,2012,11,12
202,Good location lovely room,"Stayed in a writers room, lovely spacious room, quiet and very well equipped and spotless. Not to mention the fabulous beds!  Staff friendly,helpful, and a relaxed feeling to the hotel. It is in an excellent location. This was a leisure trip but I travel a lot with work and its nice to find a hotel that gets everything right. Will certainly return & would recommend to anyone visiting Dublin.",5,2012,11,07
202,Charming centre city location with history.,"This hotel is a warm and welcoming, situated right smack in the centre of Dublin a few hundred yards into the southside. The fact that this was originally a bank gives it a unique history and some amazing architecture. The centre if the hotel is an open atrium with cosy seating around the balcony where you can sit and read while people watching. If you get a chance to see the great hall you will marvel at the ceiling and the architecture in this wonderful venue for functions.
Staff are warm and helpful as befits the Westin brand.",4,2012,11,07
202,"Great hotel in heart of Dublin, walking distance to many things","The Westin was a lovely hotel, excellent staff, centrally located in Dublin.  You could pretty much walk to anything, and the tourist center and hop/on hop off  bus is only a few blocks away. It is accross the street from Trinity College.  It is an easy walk to Temple Bar.  Rooms were lovely and very comfortable.  Would definately reccomend to those staying in the city, and I will definately stay there again if going to Dublin.",5,2012,11,07
202,Great Start to Our First Trip to Ireland!,"We spent the first four nights (Sept 11-15) of our first trip to Ireland - UK at the Westin Dublin and enjoyed every minute.  Both my husband and I were very comfortable and would definitely go back.  The location was perfect - close to Trinity College, the nightlife of Temple Bar, the genealogy resources at the National Library of Ireland, historic walking tours of Dublin, and the many stops of the Hop On Hop Off buses for expanded sightseeing.

We stayed on the SPG floor with a great view of all the activity on the street level but were high enough not to be bothered by noise and were able to see some of the historic buildings in the immediate area and distance.

The rooms were very nicely appointed with good lighting, plenty of space to store your luggage and clothes and well positioned mirrrors for enhancing the daylight into the room.  The beds were very comfortable which was especially nice after a full day of walking and sightseeing.  The bathroom was well appointed with a great soaking tub and separate shower  with plenty of hot water as well as good lighting. The television was also big enough and positioned properly for viewing from a variety of angles.  

The service upon check-in at the front desk was excellent and all our requests were met, including extending our stay one night on a very busy weekend without having to move rooms.  The concierge helped direct us to some specific locations we were interested in visiting. If we had any requests someone would come to the room very quickly to make sure we had what we needed.",5,2012,11,04
202,Beautiful but noisy,"This hotel is located in such an excellent spot, which made me so extremely happy.  The reception desk is stunning!  The reception clerk gave my children, ages 3 and 8 months, two little gift bags which made us smile.  We proceeded to our room and was pleasantly surprised at the side.  We had a Deluxe Twin with an extra bed and baby cot, but still had plenty of room.  The bathroom was brilliant!  Large with both a bathtub and a shower.  This hotel really put consideration into a family visiting.  There was an alligator tub mat, choices of baby soap, sponges, and small towels for each of them.  Another great thing was that they gave us a folder that contained information with recommendations for families visiting Dublin, several of which we did!  The beds are definitely heavenly.  My husband was excited about the HDMI and USB ports that the room which connects to the tv.  He also liked the safe in the closet.  Something that I thoroughly enjoyed, which definitely doesn't happen often in European hotels is that it had an iron and iron board with hand towels (this is freaking AWESOME!!!).   Breakfast was included in our room price and we were very grateful.  There was a great variety for all of us.  We loved our waiter...I think his name was Paulo (he's tall and thin from Venice, Italy).  He and the greeter were so thoughtful.  We were there for 6 days and 5 nights, so we were blessed to have them the first 3 or 4 days and someone else the last days.  We were not as happy with them. 

Now to the only thing that I can say bad about the hotel is that it has thin walls, doors, and windows.  We were in room 239, so we could hear a lot of the street noise especially the sirens...oh my goodness the sirens.  All times of the night.  Second was the doors.  The bathroom doors had to be pulled shut which was loud and the door into the room was heavy so it would slam shut again very loud.   I tried several times to catch it before it shut but it was too late, which means I know our neighbors were annoyed as we were with them.  Another bad thing was our air conditioner.  It seemed that around 2am to 4-430am it would shut off to fan only.  I woke up at this time every night sweating...annoying.  Last were he lights.  (something small but big when you have children).  There is one main switch for the lights.  You can switch off all of the lights in the room, but not the hallway lights.  So when I wanted my 8 month to go to sleep in her baby cot I would have to turn off all of the lights which left my 3 year old bored.  It made for long nights for us.  

Now",4,2012,11,04
202,Excellent location with amazing staff,"Greatly enjoyed our stay at the Westin Dublin. 

First off let me say that the location alone is worth staying here. Add on top of it a clean comfortable room, great staff and best of all, a SPG property where you can earn and redeem points, even better! Actually, the whole reason I picked the Westin was based on them being part of Starwood. 

Checkin was quick and easy and the bellman/doorman/evening concierge was terrific. I forget the gentleman's name, but he greatly took care of us during our stay and always had a list of suggestions of places to go and see based on what we had done that day. 

I know I have said it before, but the location of the hotel was perfect. it was across from Temple Bar and a block away from Trinity College. The hop-on/hop-off tour bus picked up either a block away in front of Trinity College or across the street at Temple Bar. One thing I wish I had known ahead of time was the airport bus also drops off fairly close to the hotel as well. (Next to Trinity College) So if your trying to save some $$ or ‚Ç¨ ‚Ç¨, take the bus to and from the airport.",5,2012,10,31
202,"Great hotel, great location","Our flight into Dublin arrived at 7:00am and after arriving to this hotel, we were greeted with a warm welcome and told our room was available.  However, we wanted to upgrade to a room with a window to the outside so unfortunately we wouldn't be able to check in.  No problem though, they stored our luggage and we were on our way to explore Dublin.  We went back to the hotel later in the afternoon and checked in and found the staff had already taken our luggage to our room.  Our room was really nice. With a view of the street.  This hotel is located very close to the Temple Bar area.  The bathroom is spacious.  The heavenly bed was a delight after a long day of traveling and exploring. After seeing how the standard rooms face inward, I was glad we chose to upgrade.  Everything was clean and staff very helpful.  Breakfast was included in our stay and consisted of hot and cold items.  Good coffee and food.  Overall, this was a great start to our vacation and I wouldn't hesitate to recommend it to anyone.",4,2012,10,31
202,Wonderful Service!,"I have platinum status with SPG, and since my travel is usually only in the US, I never really expect exceptional service, since so many others have the platinum status also. However, this hotel is incredible. The rooms are spacious and clean. The hotel staff is so nice and helpful. The atrium is a wonderful place for afternoon tea, as a gentleman next to me mentioned that it felt like a ""cathedral"" for a tea experience. The Mint Bar has some of the best cocktails I've ever had. There is nothing about this hotel that disappoints. I am here on a long stay for business, and I look forward to being here everyday. Everyone is so helpful and willing to help to make the stay very pleasant.",5,2012,10,29

Facilities: haven't used",4,2012,10,26
202,Not up to Westin standard sadly,"We stayed here for one night  we love the Starwood hotels and our owners at svo. Sadly the room we were located first overlooked the atrium and there was a wedding on and the noise echoed terribly. We are not people to complain but we asked to be moved. We were told they were full but they had a room on the 5th floor and these rooms had been renovated . The bedroom
 Was great much quieter unusual shape  so
It was quite quirky. The bed was smaller than the 'usual' Westin size bed but very comfy and lovely heavenly pillows. 
HOWEVER the bathroom was not good at all.  The bath sink taps and shower head were all great but the tiles grout walls and ceiling were not. It was di bad we didn't want to have a shower. It looked dirty.  Mould or dirty grout, paint perking off the walls and ceiling  , even finger marks on the barhrppm door. Such a shame and to be told this room had been recently renovated ??????  
We didn't want to complain But we did mention this to the reception staff and head of front of house and they were apologetic but it still Spoilt out stay. 
Location of the hotel is excellent for the city centre. ",3,2012,10,26
202,High price for what?,"Other than location to the centre of Dublin this hotel has little to offer other than it's high prices. You pay (and I mean ""pay"") for everything.
SPG members: Not worth it if you plan on exchanging points for stay! Like I said, ""you pay for everything"". There is no lounge, therefore you go to their bar. There is a breakfast, but since there is no lounge, you pay for their breakfast. For premium points, no spa of any sort (unless you call an expensive massage and pedicure as spa) it's not worth it. Instead, head to Athlone Sheraton where your actually rewarded for being a loyal SPG member. Read my report on it. 

If in Dublin and at this hotel, for bar service, walk 10 minutes to Templar Square and you will have no problems finding a good beer and reasonable prices. If your not entertained on the walk, you will be at the bar.",3,2012,10,26
202,Wouldn't stay here again,"It pains me to write that title because we wanted the end of our trip to be on a high note and thought the Westin would do that.

First, if you see a couple that is not handicapped, please don't put them in a handicapped room. Everything was obviously at a low height and it was irritating to have to bend for every little thing including making coffee. And to make me have to climb up on the tub ledge to move the shower head out was ridiculous (it was pointed straight down at the bath tub handles). I feel for handicapped people, but guests who aren't handicapped shouldn't be placed in those rooms. And no, at that point we had driven a while and lugged several bags upstairs through the halls for our 1 night stay - so going all the way back to complain and be moved wasn't exactly a convenient option either. Please consider this when giving rooms to guests.

I usually sleep soundly on Westin beds but not this time. It was too soft and my back hurt in the morning. The amenities were fine, tv was fine, and the ""city view"" I paid for was a side street view of the building across from us. Nice.

Checking out itself was fine. Here comes the incredulous part. I was walking to check out and came across a staff member to whom I said good morning. I was checking out and being handed my receipt when another couple went to the line next to us to check out. That same staff member I said good morning to literally RAN to that couple, grabbing their bags and saying, ""I'll go hold the taxi outside for you!!"" Well, I guess you mean the taxi that we would have been in, since I just finished checking out, because we were there first? I've never seen a staff member actually run past one guest to get to another guest.

Outside, we approached him and asked why he did that and he had the nerve to say that I was still in line checking out and they were done. Really? They *just* got there and I was actually finishing being handed my receipt. Nice job. Thank goodness the cab driver was really nice and friendly, otherwise the Westin would have been my final memory of Ireland.

The one positive about this hotel is its location. Right near all the sites, including Temple Bar and Trinity College.",1,2012,10,24
202,"Great location, beautiful hotel","I love SPG!  The Westin is a beautiful building which use to be a bank in it's former life, it is located in the heart of where all the action takes place. Exit the hotel and the magic of Dublin is at your fingertips, just steps away from Trinity Church, a couple of quays over from Grafton Street, cross the Liffey via Ha' Penny Bridge and a nice walk to Temple Bar, where all the nightlife takes place!

The staff was courteous and the room was spacious, and free WiFi, I'm assuming this was because of our Elite status with Starwood, but we were happy to call it home for 4 days!  The Heavenly bed was divine and just what our weary limbs. The bathroom was beautiful, with the white marble and great lighting! The water pressure was wonderful as well, which was hit or miss during our travels through Ireland.
The Atrium was a nice  and bright, arelaxing space where we got our irish coffee each morning and sifted through our  travel books for the days adventure. We wanted to come back for afternoon tea, but never made it back during the day.

The Mint Bar is a nice located in the vaults and the bartenders are nice and libations plenty. The dark bar set a nice mood for an evening drink, we were also lucky enough to spot some patrons doing the tango!

We had actually missed our flight back to Philadelphia that Saturday and there was not another flight available until the following Monday. We returned to the Westin and informed them of our situation. They immediately put is back in the same room with the same rate without any hesitation.

The staff here was amazing as was the accomodations. Should we ever return to Dublin, we will surely book our stay at the Westin!",5,2012,10,24
202,Comfiest beds,"This is the comfiest beds I have ever slept in. The pillows were just right, you sunk into the mattress, the covers were fluffy and light. In addition to that, at arrival the valet was friendly and smiling, the reception had some amazing cucumber and lime water, the television screen had a ""welcome!"""" with our last names tagged on the end, and finally, the shower shampoo, conditioner and lotion all had a beautiful smell. So good I tried to bring it back to Canada with me (unfortunately I had it confiscated due to lack of a plastic bag during security :( )
When we were checking out at 5:00am, valet service was not available at the moment, but in compromise we were personally escorted to the car park (just in the basement of the building) and were helped loading and departing.",5,2012,10,23
202,Westin Hotel Dublin,"What a lovely hotel. The Westin staff were helpful, friendly and always ready to go the extra mile. The heavenly beds were so comfortable and the Atrium lounge perfect for afternoon tea, pre dinner drinks or just relaxing. The hotel is central with the Trinity college just across the road and Temple Bar and Grafton Street just a few minutes walk away. Altogether a lovely base from which to explore central Dublin.",5,2012,10,23
202,"Great hotel, excellent service","Was met by a very friendly and service minded staff.
We were upgraded to a king size suite for free, and the room was great. Big, clean and comfortable beds.
Its about 1 minute walk to the Temple bar street, so the location is perfect.

If you choose to stay here, be sure to check out the hotel bar, Mint Bar. Good loking bar, with good drinks served by a friendly staff.

I will most likely choose a Westin hotel the next time i have the choice. This is one of the top 3 hotels i¬¥ve ever stayed in.",5,2012,10,22
202,Beautiful Hotel... Perfect Location!,"   I recently stay at The Westin in Dublin and had a amazing time. The location is perfect for anyone who wants to explore the city or is there for business. A lot of major sights are just steps from the door or a short taxi ride.
   For a room in Europe ours was big. The hotel staff was nice and friendly and our room was always clean when we came back from our day. 
  After being this spoiled I don't think I'd stay anywhere else!",5,2012,10,19
202,Not up to The Westin standards in all areas,"We are SPG members and stayed on points.  Our room was located on the Starwood Preferred Guest floor (#4).  

We had no problems with the check in process.  The concierge service was wonderful every time we used it, which was often for recommendations for restaurants, tours and directions.  The issues were mainly with the room, too soft of a bed, street noise and the room was very warm.  The lack of an outlet in the bathroom to dry your hair should be corrected.  Who wants to wake up someone else to dry your hair?  The internet fee is excessive, $15 euro per day/per device.  In this day and age with multiple i-devices that can get very expensive quickly.  The afternoon tea was a wonderful experience, I recommend doing it if you can.  We had breakfast at the restaurant on the main floor once, it was not worth it.  There are so many other cute places to eat.  

Overall, this is not the Westin standards that we have enjoyed at other locations.",3,2012,10,16
202,A very disappointing experience from this hotel.,"Stayed, for a weekend, in this hotel recently - very disappointing experience. 

Phoned ahead to enquire about the parking facilities. The receptionist couldn‚Äôt tell me if there was anywhere to pull up outside the hotel. Was referred to the concierge, that wasn‚Äôt available. Seemed like a ‚Äúits not my job answer‚Äù situation. 
On checking in, at 5pm, we were told that our room wasn‚Äôt ready. Not the end of the world, we could plan around it. Sought a rough estimate on how long we would have to wait. If 20 mins we would wait and let our event know we would be delayed, if 2 hours we go ahead to our event.  The receptionist couldn‚Äôt tell us. A very frustrating wait later we finally got checked in. Check in consisted of a swipe of the credit card, been given the keys and an attempt to sign up to a ‚Äúloyalty card‚Äù - that was it.
The courtesy, at check in,  of a basic orientation to the hotel and its facilities would have been very useful if not expected. Never the less we managed to find the elevator to the room ourselves. It did however limit greatly our utilisation of the hotel.
The check in experience tainted our weekend stay in the hotel. The smell of vomit that remained in the reception for over 6 hours on Saturday afternoon also didn‚Äôt help.
My understanding is that hotels get their star rating from a combination of facilities and service. The service experienced, as described above, was below what I expect from a 3 star hotel. The facilities available are still a mystery to me, as is the Westin retaining a 5 star rating.

My last minor bone of contention relates to their parking arrangements. When the hotel facilities are full they have an arrangement with a near by multi story car park. The preferential rate is a 3 euro reduction in the over night cost. From 28 euro down to 25 euro a night. I know that a 3 star hotel across the street has a rate of 10 euro a night in that very same multi story car park.",2,2012,10,10
202,Elegant Comfort,This is a can't go wrong hotel.  Centrally located warm and welcoming.  With all the amenities one would want of an expensive hotel.  The rooms a clean and superbly quiet.  A bar in the basement where local professionals hang out after work.  Everybody within the hotel is helpful.,5,2012,10,10
202,Poor Room,"Was very surprised to find that my room had two windows, which both opened onto an interior atrium - overlooking a mezzanine lounge.  Therefore, there was no possibility of opening the window to get any fresh air and worse, could not open drapes, as windows looked directly onto lounge.  Even as a Starwood Preferred guest, there were no other rooms available.  Hotel services were very good and breakfast was adequate.",3,2012,10,10
202,The nicer your hotel...,"The old adage is true; the ""nicer"" your hotel, the more you'll pay for your wifi.  Honestly, after dropping a decent sum on a room, a 15 Euro a day charge for in-room wifi is pretty fresh, particularly when it's free at any of the 3 nearby starbucks cafes.  

The main problem was that I couldn't get a good night's sleep here. There was constant street noise at this location, not pub noise, as you get in Temple bar, but traffic horns and sirens at least once an hour through the night.  The worst part was a very old, too soft and ""springy"" bed.  I stayed 3 nights and my back was WRECKED when I left.  Not to mention that I booked a double room with two twins and was given a double bed, in fact, a rather short double bed.  (I am 5""4' and my feet kept hanging off the edge unless I scooted all the way up to my headboard).  I feel as though the room was small and oddly shaped, thus a short bed was a compromise they made.  

Minor complaints were that there was no outlet in the bathroom for your hairdryer and the tile all needed to be regrouted.  It had been touched up in the shower itself, but the floor was a little run down and black in some spots in the grout.  The tub was also a bit discolored and grungy.  Finally, the bar was hit or miss; good fish and chips and a nice Spanish wine, hard to find in Dublin, but the most disgusting ""lamb burger"" ever.  

Good points about the hotel: Location, friendly staff, many ammenities inside the hotel so you don't need to leave if the weather is bad---except, of course, if you want to use wifi.

For the price, I can only go 3 stars.",3,2012,10,10
202,awesome hotel!,"Great hotel but it books up fast! First time going to Europe that we didn't get a room after an all night flight immediately, but they got us in as soon as housekeeping arrived & cleaned some rooms! Great location aross from Trinity College",4,2012,10,09
202,Really Good,"We had a great stay at the Westin. We were there for one night attending a friends wedding which was elsewhere and it was the perfect base from which to spend a lazy afternoon and night in the city. Our room was lovely and overlooked Trinity .  I thought there might be noise from the nearby fire station but it was totally quiet. Staff were charming and professional, clearly well trained and nothing was too much trouble.We will go back.",5,2012,10,08
202,well worth it,stayed there for 2 nights used to be a bank  central  in o connel street - this was 2 years ago - nice rooms  very good breakfast and restaurant. drinks can be at high end for prices but you do get nice surroundings and friendly staff. it has valet parking which is a good thing in this day and age.,5,2012,10,07
202,Perfect. Best location. Attentive service.,"This was our 2nd time staying at the Dublin Westin and we weren't disappointed.  Proximity to St. Stephens Green, Grafton street, Temple Bar, and all the major sites in the centre is unequalled.

The mattresses are first rate and linens were luxurious.  Bathrooms are fabulous and tiling in showers and floor appear to recently have been upgraded.

Big floor-to-ceiling windows allowed view outside and were thickly paned to prevent exterior noise from permeating into the room.

Tea service at late afternoon was a treat and a nice reprieve after a morning and afternoon walking.",5,2012,10,04
202,In the centre of Dublin history,"The Dublin Westin might not be the most posh hotels in the city, but its location is the best - a street across from Trinity, two blocks from the Liffey, 5 minutes of quick walk to Grafton Street, and at most 15 minutes walk to escape the crowd in Stephens Green. Like all Westin hotels, the Dublin Westin offers quiet and efficient service, clean rooms with heavenly beds (to which I have become addicted), and a general willingness to accommodate requests. However, I still find fancy hotels charging for wifi in the room an insult, since guests are already paying premium rates. Ask for a room facing out and not the Atrium Bar. Ours had a gigantic bathroom and shower stall. A real treat after some small bathrooms during our trip.",4,2012,10,01
202,The best night of our lives to date!!,"My husband and I stayed in the Westin on Fwbruary 4th. We had gotten married that day at a nearby historical venue without accomodation so had chosen the Westin to stay as it was nearby. How glad were we with our decision??? We had booked the junior suite and were upgraded without charge to the presidential suite which was truely the most amazing set of rooms we have ever seen. Including a gym, dining room, jacuzzi bath, living room, sauna etc - it was a night to remember. In addition we were made such a fuss of when we arrived at 3am by the staff that we felt really special. Another highlight was a brunch we had organised at 12pm the next day - the food and service were impeccable. The whole experience topped what was already an amazing day and we are so grateful to all at the Westin!!! Thank you!",5,2012,09,29
202,Odd Shaped Room,"So there is a lot of charm in staying in an old converted bank. One of the not charming things... a very odd awkward shaped room.  I don't even think there was a window in the room. 

Westin service was good, though we had some confusion/ problems with the wifi.

Parking is expensive, but no worse than most major cities, and location-wise you could walk to basically all of the tourist sites in Dublin",4,2012,09,26
202,Historical building turned into a classy hotel,"Arriving for the first time in Ireland we made our way to the Westin. We were greeted by a wonderful young man at the Starwood Privilege checkin. There was no wait and with our new friend at the desk checkin was seamless. We progressed to our upgrade mini suite and were overwhelmed by the layout. A large heavenly king size bed. Tastefully decorated bathroom. And then spotted a spiral staircase. Venturing upwards we discovered our own personal library and office space. A large flat screen TV made this a cozy relax spot after a day of touring. 
Friendly staff throughout the hotel has made this a very pleasant stay",5,2012,09,25
202,Needs to improve on service.,"Like many travellers have expressed in their reviews this is a great place, however as a frequent guest here I would like to comment on their lack of service.

Two times I have arrived in Dublin on short notice without any reservation. I have called westin reservation to make a reservation for the night and explained that I am a Starwood preferred guest. They have politely answered that that are fully booked for the night I have asked them to put me on a waiting list for a room and asked them to contact me either via phone or email if a room will be available.

During the day nothing have happened and no one from the hotel have tried to contact me. At this time I have looked at the hotel web site, found vacant rooms and booked it myself.

At the check in, hours later, no one have contacted me regarding my request or does mention anything at the check in.

One could expect more from a 5 star brand like this.

On my last visit I asked the night portier for the local newspaper to be delivered to my room the following morning. When no paper had shown up outside my door at 9am a call at ask where it was. The answer was that they had to check with the cornegice. Needless to say, I did never recive any paper, explanation or apology. To their defens I will have to say that I did not have to pay either.

",4,2012,09,24
202,"Great hotel, Great location!","We had looked at a number of hotels online before finally deciding to book the Westin as we had stayed in other Westin hotels previously (Shanghai and San Francisco).  We had a fantastic stay and would definitely return if travelling to Dublin in the future.  The room was large and comfortable - especially the beds! The bathroom was huge and the room had all the facilities you would expect including hairdryer, ipod docking station, robes etc.  

Breakfast was included in our stay and the selection was fantastic.  Service was great and nothing was too much trouble (soya milk was provided on request) and a special mention to Paolo who served us with humour and a smile every morning.

The hotel is extremely well located for shopping and eating with Grafton and O'Connell Street a short distance away on foot.  We spoke to the concierge who were extremely helpful and friendly (a special mention to Sam, Peter and Laszlo) and were able to organise taxis, dinner reservations, shopping trips and to recommend excellent places to eat.

I would definitely recommend this hotel to friends and family and hope to return for another stay in the near future.",4,2012,09,24
202,Irish hospitality at its best,"We spent a weekend at this hotel and I would give it full marks all round. The room, the facilities the food, the cleanliness and the service were all first class. The staff could not have been more helpful or friendly. When we asked anything of them they went out of their way to accommodate our requests and they were regularly proactive in ensuring that our needs were being met satisfactorily. I always feel that there is a balance to be struck between confirming that a guest has everything they need without making the guest feel that they are being badgered all of the time. The hotel staff did very well in getting the balance right",5,2012,09,21
202,dining experience,"i didnt stay in the hotel,i only went in the restaurant. was really disappointed. first time to have my dining experience in here was a lil bit disappointing.. would like to get a table for 2 and the waiter said that theres no table available at the moment but we can see that there is a couch in front of us. and i just ask if we could sit in there for a dessert he said yes. service was okay, really busy night id say. Second time i went with few friends didnt let us in. i asked if they have table for four and just said no. so we just went somewhere else. just a little but disappointed.",3,2012,09,21
202,good value for the money,"My husband and i stayed at the Westin for 5 nights on last august.The hotel situated in the middle of the ""right"" places. 5 mins from the tempel bar which is the area for the pubs and music,and few mins away from Grafton street which is a lovely area for caffes and resturants and shops.
The hotel facitilites are very nice and well kept. Service is very good and the persons who helped us at the receiption were very helpfull, and welcoming.
The room was spacisous,nice furnitures,coffe machine in the room,nice and big bathroom and the bed was very very compftable.The only small problem which bother us is that the coffee machine was not cleaned evry day..which i expect from this kind of hotel to do.
In overall this hotel was a good choice and i defently will come back to staye there when i will visit Dublin which i highyt recommend on !",5,2012,09,21
202,Great Location,"The Westin is a perfect place to stay in Dublin.  It has an excellent breakfast buffet.  Although, it is the same each day the variety allows for a different breakfast each day.  Ours was included with our room so it made it nice.  Otherwise it is quite pricey.

Location is the key to this hotel.  We took the AirLink from the airport and it dropped us off right across the street in front of Trinity College.  Super easy.  We bought the return ticket and the hop on hop off all at the same time and saved 4 Euro per person.  

Hop On Hop Off is the way to go on the first two days.  First off you will be tired so it is good to map out the city on the top of the bus (Bring a rain jacket).  Then you can go back to those places you want to later.  There is a stop right across the street from the hotel.

If you don't plan on spending a lot of time in Dublin you have to go to Trinity College and see the Book of Kells.  It is directly across the street.

The other things that were helpful was a blow dryer and an American plug.  It is under the desk and very helpful since my adapter didn't work.

They stored our luggage for us since our room was not ready when we arrived.  They have a secure location and we felt very comfortable leaving our things there.

Perfect vacation!  Thanks!",5,2012,09,20
202,Very nice most of the time,"I was a very regular guest at this hotel for 18 months. It's location is excellent, and the rooms upto the normal Westin standard. Food is good. Staff generally OK, but has been spoiled on one or two ocasions with inappropriate atitude.",4,2012,09,19
202,Great hotel!,"The Westin is a beautiful hotel in probably the best location in Dublin. The service is extremely friendly, just as it should be. Spacious rooms and delicious breakfast. Definitely 5 stars from me and I will have no doubt where to stay next time I'm in Dublin.",5,2012,09,19
202,Good central location,"I've stayed here a few times and the fact I'm a SPG member certainly sways my hotel choice on this. 
Location is good. 
Rooms are fine a little bland and Irish - particularly the bathrooms - single sink, twin taps, small shower. A nice westin bed of course and probably a big saving grace to the room. 
Club sandwich on room service is delicious and well worth having. I wish all hotel club sandwiches were like this. Even if all Westins clubs were like that would be a good starting point. ",4,2012,09,18
202,Wonderful Hotel - Fantastic Location,"Stayed in Westin Dublin for one night in September.  Wonderful hotel with a fantastic location.  All staff we encountered were welcoming, efficient and pleasant.  We were fortunate enough to be upgraded and our room (on the fifth floor) was one of the best and definitely the most quiet hotels rooms I have stayed in (although of course the rooms beside us could have been empty but I don't believe that was the case).  Extremely well thought out layout and all necessary amenities.  Very tasty breakfast.  The location of the hotel is second to none.  Just across the road from the entrance to Temple Bar which means you have easy access to all the pubs/bars/restaurants you could need but with the advantage of a quiet location.  Also about 5 minutes walk to the shops on both Grafton Street and O'Connell Street.  Would not hesitate to recommend a stay at the Westin and hope to be back soon.",5,2012,09,18
202,Exceeded our expectations,"My husband and I traveled here for a quick weekend getaway, and we were pleasantly surprised by this hotel; we knew that it was going to be a good hotel, and the location looked favorable, but once we arrived, we realized we were in for a treat.  The location is perfect - you couldn't ask for a better location in Dublin.  Everything is within a short walking distance - the Guinness Storehouse is just about a 20 minute walk.  Perfect location next to Grafton Street, Temple Bar and Trinity College - all just blocks away.  

The service was also great.  We enjoyed the Mint Bar each night.  Our room was larger than we expected and was extremely comfortable.  We didn't try the restaurant (too many great options out in Dublin), but we did order room service for breakfast one day, which was fine.

We'll definitely stay here again and recommend it to friends and family.",5,2012,09,17
202,"Pretty good, but some disappointments","I stayed here for a week during a conference in Dublin. Overall this is a very good hotel; the rooms are very well appointed, the furnishings are elegant and the location is very handy for most central Dublin attractions. There were a few minor disappointments though. The breakfast service seemed badly managed; various items in the buffet had run out without being replenished, the staff forgot to ask me if I wanted tea or coffee on a couple of mornings, and there was a general lack of attention to detail. The gym is tiny; thankfully I went at six in the morning so it was not crowded. Finally, when I was going to check out the line at reception was so long that I had to leave without checking out, because I was going to miss my bus. Having said all of that, I would probably come back during my next stay in Dublin. ",4,2012,09,17
202,"Great room, service & food!","I have stayed here a number of times, and the cleanliness, staff and location are top notch...have eaten lots of room service and at the Mint Bar (great staff) many times (terrific fresh fish and appis) but this time actually went with a colleague to ""The Exchange"" main restaurant...very surprised at how good it was, one of the best meals I have had in my years of traveling to Dublin (and get to go to some of the top business-frequented haunts.)  My cod over beans with herbed oil was pan done perfectly and my guests tenderloin of beef arrived on an impresssive butcher block, was thick cut and medium rare just as reqested...he raved and piled with grilled tomotoes and onion rings on the side, the deserts were sublime and reminded me of Aureole in NYC...a terrific meal, and staff there also great, refined but friendly.",5,2012,09,17
202,Service is not up to Westin standard,"The room was fine, really large and well appointed.  However I could not say the same for the service.  Something is seriously wrong in this hotel.  Breakfast service was very poor - coffee took ages to arrive and no butter on the table.  The toaster for the bread is stuck in a corner which holds up traffic for the breakfast buffet.  And not a great variety compared with other 5 star hotels which we have stayed in over the last two weeks.
The room hadn't been cleaned when we came back to the room at 1 p.m.  We know we were staying an extra night (and probably the other rooms were being cleaned for new guests), however it is quite rare to have rooms in 5 star hotels cleaned so late.
All in all, not up to the usual Westin standard that we have enjoyed in other parts of the world.
A big plus however is the location - right next door to Trinity College, and a few minutes walk to both the shopping and bar areas.",3,2012,09,16
202,Westin Dublin,Great position in the middle of Dublin with secure parking available.  Room was recently refurbished and very pleasant.  Breakfast was excellent.  Wifi available but there was a charge for it.  There was a gym which although small was perfectly adequate.,4,2012,09,14
202,Great staff but poor restaurant service,"I stayed here with two rooms on points. The welcome was great and my father, who was celebrating his 80th birthday, was delighted with his birthday cheesecake - Westins, in my experience, do birthdays well.

My one negative experience was dinner in the restaurant. Service was extremely slow and, even then, the waiter managed to get the order wrong. Having said that, when I intervened and spoke with the Maitre d' (Lewis), he personally served us from that point onwards.",3,2012,09,14
202,Excellent Hotel,"This Hotel was outstanding from the moment of our check-in to our departure.  Everyone and I mean everyone was pleasant, helpful and very attentive to all our needs.  The room (we had one overlooking the Atrium) was beautiful - they mentioned they had just been renovated.  There were robes, full coffee/tea service, safe and free WiFi and all without an extra charge.  They also have a business center with two computers for you to use and also no charge.
The full breakfast was wonderful - one of the nicest I've had - not a disappointment at all.  The dinning room was very nice as well - great service and quality of food was excellent.  We loved this Hotel and hated to leave - the location is perfect - close to -  all within easy walking to most tourist sites.",5,2012,09,14
202,Great location. Wonderful staff,Rooms were clean. Staff was ridiculously nice and helpful. Food was ok. Location was great - across the street from Temple Bar. I would definitely stay here again. They made a winter trip to Ireland very enjoyable,4,2012,09,13
202,Fantastic Location,"The Westin was an old bank building and the Vault Bar in the basement is a great place to have drinks before going out for the night or after you come back from a night out.  The staff are top notch and the hotel is appointedly nicely.  The room was very small and we were upgraded!  I can't imagine what the room would have been without the upgrade.  Though small, the room was great!  Wonderful bathtub that one could stretch out in after a long day site-seeing.  The beds were slightly bigger than a twin, but smaller than a full size (by American standards).  The AirCoach from the Dublin Airport sets down and picks up in front of the hotel.  Trinity College is across the street and Grafton Street a few blocks up.  The National Library is not far in the other direction.  Stellar location!",4,2012,09,12
202,Great Hotel in Great Location,We had a great stay at this hotel in July.  The location right by Trinity College couldn't have been better for us and the room was very well appointed and very comfortable.  All the staff we encountered were super friendly and helpful.,5,2012,09,10
202,Buyer Beware!!!,"Nice Hotel, Good location....Horrific service.  This supposed five star hotel would rarely answer phone calls from our room (rang ten-fifteen minutes at a time), missed wake up calls (even showed where the scheduled calls had mysteriously been scratched out by someone) and would receive unrequested room cleaning refusal slips under our door as an excuse not to daily upkeep the room.  It felt like we were in high school being systematically bullied by the cool kids.  There is a serious problem with the staffing of this hotel.  I have been traveling for thirty years and have never encountered anything this bad and/or childish.  My days of being a customer at the Westin chain have ended!!!",1,2012,09,10
202,Great location,"The rooms were great and well specified for the price. The location was stellar, right in the heart of the city with Temple bar, trinity college and o'connell street right on the doorstep, the reception staff were well informed for day tours and things to see and do in the city.

Highly recommend",4,2012,09,07
202,Great Location!!,"We stayed here twice during our trip to Ireland. 3 nights at the begining of our vacation and 2 nights at the end. 
Great location!! Right across from Temple Bar and down the street from Grafton Street and O'Connell which is where all the action is. It is also across the street from Trinity College. Yes, so close to everything but not a problem with noise at night... 
The rooms were big for Europe standard and full amenitiies including Facecloths which a lot of European hotels do not have. 
We had breakfast included with our room rates which was quite nice but not to worry, if you don't have breakfast included, you can pay for it at the hotel (pretty expensive) or there are lots of restaurants in the area where you can get meals.
The atrium bar was quite confortable and many people go in there for tea and scones during the day... Also, you can get wi-fi in the Atrium Bar
I must say that the first 3 nights, we stayed in Room 243 and.... the bathroom had like a musty odor to it so... try for a different room. I should have but was already unpacked.",4,2012,09,06
202,very nice stay,we stayed with a group of 14 rooms at ned of scotland ireland tour.  we chose hotel for good location and were not disappointed. we were able to walk to trinity and great restaurants. rooms are spacious and american standards. bathrooms marble. hotel breakfast was very lavish for europe. the bar was nice on second floor and good service. the only down side was we had arranged for porter service to unlad bus and there was onl one poor bellman on duty when we arrived with 24 people .,4,2012,09,03
202,Excellent stay at Westin Dublin,"We just had the true pleasure of staying at the Westin Dublin this past weekend.  Due to an ""American Invasion of Ireland"" for the Notre Dame/Navy Football game, hotels booked solid almost 5 months in advance.  We were originally set to stay in far south Dublin, but a room happened to come available at the last moment and we snatched it up.  The Westin staff could not have been more pleasurable during our stay.  They were as polite as any staff we've ever seen.  The location next to Temole Bar provided easy access once the all of the Guinness had been consumed :-)  It was roughly a 22 Euro cab ride and close enough to the train station that no walk was really out of the question.  Excellent all the way around.",5,2012,09,02
202,Extremely comfortable rooms and relaxing lounges,"Beautiful hotel, extremely comfortable rooms with high quality furniture and bathrooms.  Room amenities were excellent. 

Lounge on the mezzanine extremely comfortable place to relax and have afternoon tea etc  Good range of bars and restaurants within the hotel itself.

Great location, central for sightseeing.

Only bad thing to say is that I would have expected a 5 star hotel to have a pool. There is only a gym here.",4,2012,08,31
202,Excellent staff,"We chose this hotel because we often stay at Westin's in U.S. and like the high standards of the rooms, restaurants and public areas.  We were very pleased with this hotel.  The staff could not be more helpful, especially Sam at the front desk.  He spent time helping us plan our drive from Dublin to Glendalough.  He also provided expert information on Glendalough.  The location is great.  Finally, the Temple Bar features outstanding drinks.",5,2012,08,30
202,Great location,"Great location near Trinity College. Lovely decor and friendly staff. Highly recommend when in Dublin.  The Most comfortable beds ever which is great after flying in from Melbourne , Australia. The rooms are beautifully decorated. Would highly recommend this hotel if flying in from a great distance as comfortable beds, great furnishings, lovely staff and close to some great spots.",5,2012,08,30
202,"Staff very friendly, noisy room, be aware of the green choice","We stayed 3 nights in the Westin. We thought it would become one of the highlights on our journey in Ireland. The staff was very friendly and capable. We stayed in an executive room, because we wanted to have streetview. There was a lot of noise in our room, not from the street, but from the neighbouring rooms and the alley. We chose for the green choice. When you choose this programme, you get a 5 euro cheque. We obtained for the green choice, not for the money, but because we have respect for nature and natural resources.Unfortunately, we had a problem with our shower. A very helpful man came to repair the shower, but there was a mess all over the bathroom. Because we had chosen for the green choice, there was no room service available for the 3 days we stayed in the Westin. So we did not get new bath towels as well. So I had to contact the concierge to stop the green choice. In the evening our room was cleaned up.",3,2012,08,30
202,One of our favorite hotels,"We felt utterly happy with our visit to the Westin Dublin. We were in the city for a full week (while many people told us we'd be bored after a few days, we loved the city and have much left on our to-see list), and found ourselves enjoying the comforts of the hotel. Exceptional location, very friendly and capable staff, comfortable room, very good food, lovely public spaces. Tired the first day, we took meals in the hotel. They were exceedingly good, so we ended up eating all of our breakfasts there and a couple of dinners. The staff called the night before check-out to check in with us regarding our departure needs -- and to thank us for our stay. This may be standard in this quality of hotel, but it is a standard rarely met before for us (we usually stay in 4-star not 5-star hotels, but have had the chance to stay in 5-stars before, but have never felt quite so well considered by the staff). The city and the hotel were both first-rate.",5,2012,08,29
202,Excellent location!,"For my first time in Dublin this turned out to be a perfect location. We enjoyed a deluxe room on the 5th floor with views of Trinity College, and although this hotel is right in the centre of the city and only moments from Temple Bar it was completely quiet. 
We did not use many of the hotel facilities apart from the gym, which was well fitted out with the latest fitness equipment. The bars and lounges were airy and comfortable. And the service from the few staff we spoke to was quick, polite and always with a smile. 
For us it was the perfect base from which to explore the city. Our only disappointment is that after only 2 nights we had to leave. 
We definitely hope to have the opportunity to enjoy The Westin Dublin again and we will be bringing all of our friends. ",5,2012,08,29
202,"Perfect location, friendly staff--We loved it","Staff extremely friendly. This was so nice to check into after an overnight flight. We were feeling awful at 9 am after dealing with a long trip in from the airport and a typically Dublin rainy day. They let us check right in, which was a godsend. The room was spacious and nicely decorated. Bathroom was gorgeous. You really couldn't have asked for anything nicer (unless you like those European handheld showers). We made tea with the electric kettle, which really made us feel so much better, and then ventured out for breakfast at an amazing restaurant nearby  that the staff had recommended. the hotel also presented my daughter with special WESTIN gifts, as well as  the loan of a set of puzzles and bath toys that entertained her. We ate at the Mint Bar one night. The staff was wonderful at the restaurant and we enjoyed being in the vault of the bank that had originally been on site, but the food was not great. Still, we got 20% off as SPG members and it was relaxing and stress free to eat at the hotel, especially with a six year old in tow. We spent or third night in Dublin at another hotel that we did not like nearly as much. We will definitely stay here again on our next trip to Ireland.",5,2012,08,28
202,Excellent hotel in a great location,"The hotel ia excellent. While I did mot get an upgraded room with my 
Starwood Gold status, the staff was accomodating me with an early check in. The room itself was very nice facing Trinity College. The location could not have been better, centrally located to everything. 

I would definitely stay here on my next trip to Dublin",5,2012,08,28
202,Right in the middle of the action,"Great hotel .Stayed twice, a week apart .First room overlooking internal atrium was very good .Second time had a delux room overlooking office block next door .Would choose just a classic/internal room if staying again.Breakfast was superb.Very central location to all attractions",4,2012,08,23
202,Westin Dublin is an excellent place to stay,"We recently stayed at the Weston Hotel on Westmoreland Street in Dublin. As a frequent traveler I have stayed in literally hundreds of hotels over the last 10 years and to date this was the best stay ever!! Great location, amazing staff and the amenities far surpassed my best expectations. Thank you Westin Dublin, and for those traveling to Dublin looking for a place to stay, look no further. Simply the best.",5,2012,08,21
202,Superb hotel in great location,"We recently stayed here as we were visiting the Dublin for the Horse Show, as a birthday present for my wife. 
Right from check in all the staff were very friendly and efficient. We had a lovely room overlooking Temple bar, it was clean and well appointed, beds fantastic!! Coffee machine, tea etc. 
On check in I had briefly mentioned it was my wife's birthday, When we returned from our first afternoon of Guinness sampling, they bought up some delightful petit fours with happy birthday on them, a very thoughtful touch.
Salsa dancing in the Hotel bar on Friday night was great fun! 
Concierge efficient, organising a delicious diner for us.
Overall very pleased, 5 star!",5,2012,08,20
202,"great location,very nice hotel","very nice choice in a fun city. The rooms were comfortable and clean. service very warm and welcoming. Much higher quality than Westins I have stayed in in the USA. Perfect location for Temple Bar, Trinity college and other central Dublin sights",5,2012,08,17
202,Great location,"We stayed for a night last week and loved the hotel. Spacious, comfortable rooms, excellent service and great location. My only peeve- 15 Euros for wifi! When are hotels going to stop charging for wifi?",5,2012,08,17
202,Central to the best of Dublin,"Stayed three nights using SPG points.  Central to the best of Dublin is an understatement!  We were foot steps away from Trinity College, Temple Bar, O'Connell Street, National Museums, Liffey river, Parlament, Grafton street shops, and much more.  The exterior is somewhat Georgian looking.  The room we stayed had a poor view but the room was very spacious, clean, modern, bathroom was also very modern and marble with great shower.  Overall appearance of the hotel interior was very elegant and beautiful, yet warm and quaint.  Staff were very responsive and helpful.

This was a great introduction to Dublin and a comfortable place to get over jet lag while seeing the sights of the city.

We used the bar restaurant once and the food and service were excellent and the price was not bad.  A couple of doors down for the hotel is a Starbucks as well as many other casual and more formal places to eat.

Downside might be parking which was valet and about $25/nt.

I would very much recommend this hotel with any hesitation!",5,2012,08,16
202,Highly recommend,"Stayed here for 4 nights recently.  Love the atrium where you can get scones and coffee in am.  Rooms lovely.  Location across from Trinity College and adjacent to Temple Bar cannot be beat.

Stayed at Shelbourne same trip,and preferred the Westin.
Beth OKeefe",5,2012,08,13
202,Great Location,"Its not quite up to US standard Westin, but close. Rooms are very comfortable and roomy enough. The bar area is wow! Good. The staff, including concierge are young and not overly friendly or knowledgeable as you would expect; that's what brought my rating down. They Did well when asked, but not proactive in helping. The location is the #1 reason to stay here. You are right next to Trinity, can walk to Grafton / OConnell / Temple Bar easily and lots of buses. Right across the street is Starbucks, souvenirs and convenience store. ",4,2012,08,11
202,The perfect location for exploring Dublin,"The Westin is an elegant and comfortable hotel located right next to Trinity College, making it the perfect location for exploring Dublin.  The hotel has the intimate feel of a boutique hotel with all of the amenities you expect at a Westin.  The staff was extremely gracious and bent over backwards to accommodate any of our needs, including walking us 2 blocks to direct us to a restaurant.   Rooms are a good size by European standards and the bathroom was spacious.  I will definitely return to this hotel next time I visit Dublin.",5,2012,08,09
202,Excellent hotel in unbeatable location,"I really liked this hotel when we stayed there for 4 nights last October,  we had stayed in the Shelbourne the previous year which we also liked but I think it is staff who make or break a stay and the Westin staff are infinitely more friendly and pleasant than the Shelbourne. Its a beautiful hotel in the centre of Dublin, located across the road from Temple Bar (and importantly not in it!).  We had a good size quirky shaped room, view of a side street, best bed I have ever slept in. We got a great rate on a secret hotel website. Breakfast was not included but when we checked in we received these vouchers which meant we got it half-price, very tasty and good service.",4,2012,08,08
202,The Best!,"We loved the Westin Dublin!  Our room was L shaped and looked into the atrium, which made the fact that the hotel used to be a bank, making the hotel feel more special.  The bathroom was large and had separate tub and shower.  We loved the bar and ate there both nights of our stay.  The location in Dublin is unbeatable- walking distance to everything.",5,2012,08,07
202,location as well as style,"We stay here regularly on visits to Dublin, great location for shopping or to do business. The staff are very friendly and the rooms are beautiful and we would recommend staying here. The food is quiet good too so overall excellent and we are looking forward to our next stay here.",5,2012,08,04
202,Great location but poor check in practices,"the good: centrally located, clean
the bad:  Check in time. We arrived at 10am and while we realize we could not check in right away(although some hotels will accommodate you) we had to wait until 3pm on the dot. When we arrived the representative asked us if we wanted to upgrade for an additional fee of 40 Euros a night and as such we would have been able to check in immediately since that room was available. seems like bait and switch, but we refused since we paid $375 a night to stay there already. We went out and came back at 2:45 and our room was not ready, it  just seemed to us that because we didnt upgrade we were going to have to be made to wait.  Other then that it was a nice hotel and like i said earlier great location.",3,2012,08,04
202,Great Hotel with Great Location,Great experience here.  It's in a great location and I ended up walking to most of my destinations.  The street is busy but I was not disturbed at all.  Temple Bar area is super close and lots of places to eat and drink near by.,5,2012,07,31
202,"Great place, great service!",I was worried about staying at a hotel on a busy street in a busy city. I always like to have a quiet room to come back to after a busy day sightseeing. Our rooms were extremely quiet even though they were on the first floor facing Westmoreland. Our rooms were clean and comfortable. There was a running toilet in our room that was fixed immediately. The concierge was very helpful and friendly. There was a problem with our bill which was cleared up immediately with many apologies. I am impressed with the overall quality of service at this extremely well situated hotel in Dublin City. Great staff!,5,2012,07,30
202,Excellent choice,"Overall excellent. This hotel is in a great central location (walking distance to most things but taxis right in front 24x7) and is totally modern. The staff was very accomodating, stored our bags and brought them to the rooms while we were out the first day, etc. Our only dealing with the concierge service did show a bit of inexperience on the part of the people covering the desk at that particular time. Note: we reserved 5 standard rooms through Expedia. Price was very good for this quality level of hotel. However, the 5 rooms included one superb room with a large bathroom (shower and bath) and living area facing a side street, one facing the interior courtyard (similar with a different layout), two I would regard as normally sized, and one small one that had a small bathroom with only a tub (no separate shower) which some might regard as a modern version of the small rooms you typically find in an older European hotel. The upshot is that you probably should know what specific room type you are getting in the standard category if you are in a position to be able to select your room.",5,2012,07,29
202,"Great location, nice rooms",This is a good hotel in a good location. The rooms are nice and the staff is pleasant. my only complaint is the 'concierge' was a young kid who didn't actually know anything and just kept looking stuff up on the internet to answer my questions. i could do that myself! A concierge should have local knowledge.,4,2012,07,27
202,Tops in Dublin,"Friendly staff, unbeatable location and spacious, quiet rooms....  after three trips to Dublin this time I got it right by staying here.  I was hesitant as I typically prefer small hotels and was fearful that the Westin would prove to be just another anonymous business hotel, but was pleasantly surprised at both the friendliness and local touch.  The second floor bar, tearoom was elegant, warm and inviting.  The rooms themselves spacious and quiet.  Best of all was the location, central to shopping, sightseeing and nightlife--- Trinity College, Temple Bar and not far from St. Stephens Green.",5,2012,07,27
202,Nice accommondation in Dublin,Great hotel and great location. If you are staying in Dublin I would definitely recommend the Westin Dublin.  The rooms and overall hotel has the amenities and class you'd expect from Westin. My room was cousy and hotel was excellent.,5,2012,07,25
202,Great Option for a Dublin trip.,"Should say out front that I got very lucky booking this last minute off an online service that gave me an incredible rate - and usually when I do that I arrive at check in to groans from staff who then put me in the smallest, crappiest room they can find. NOT SO at the Westin yesterday - big grin from Neil who apologized that they did not have a twin contemporary ready at that time - 2:45 pm - but disappeared and came back with an even better solution (lovely deluxe room - see pics). Everything was splendid - and this might be the very best location of all Dublin center hotels because you are inches from O'Connell Bridge - where you can catch buses and trains in every direction and you've got trendy Grafton Street blocks away. See a lot of ppl complaining about the 15 euro internet charge but in the hotel's defense they give 20 minutes free for checking email etc. and you can sit with a coffee in the beautiful Mezzanine Lounge and get an access code to browse the net while you relax. I've got 5 star taste on a 2 star budget but everything's possible if you're flexible. Loved this short stay - especially the Heavenly Beds!!!",4,2012,07,24
202,Great location,"This is a great location for sight-seeing and or shopping as it is almost equal walking distance to Henry Street and Grafton Street and the tourist buses stop just around the corner. 
Our room was very nicely decorated although it only had two single beds and not a queen bed as we had expected. Although our room was on the first floor and looking onto a busy street (Westmoreland street), we had the a/c on so could not hear the traffic. 
Did not eat here so can not comment although we had a couple of drinks in the Mint bar before going out and that was a nice experience.",4,2012,07,24
202,Fantastic choice,"I'm so impressed. If you are staying in Dublin I would definitely recommend the Westin.

Perfect location to easily get around town.  The rooms and overall hotel has the amenities and class you'd expect from Westin.  Our double room was very clean (as was the whole hotel) and enough space to have our luggage out, move around, etc.  Desk, TV, coffeemaker, etc were all in the room (fyi hairdryer is hidden in one of the drawers inside the closet).   Only improvement there would be better option for Internet access.  Outrageous pricing on that.

Now for the staff - couldn't be nicer, more accommodating or helpful with directions, recommendations, etc. 

I had a bit of a dramatic story..  after arriving home I noticed my jewelry case missing.  Thinking back I had the thought that I hadn't even seen it when re-packing.  I immediately phoned the hotel to say I thought my jewelry had been stolen.  From the front desk to manager to then security, everyone treated the situation perfectly.  I felt they immediately understood and related to my anguish - and acted fast to investigate.  They kept me in contact and updated over the 24 hour period - again with a tone that made me feel they really were taking it very seriously.  36 hours after getting home I arrived back from work to see my puppy playing with the case (!!)  The bandit must have taken it from my bag when I wasn't looking and hid it.  Very funny but was very embarrassed to call the hotel considering what top priority they gave my frantic call.  Once again, they were extremely professional and understanding.  They did not get upset (at least in front of me) that I no doubt had the hotel turned around a bit in their search but genuinely seemed just happy that I had my case back.",5,2012,07,22
202,Something's missing....,"We arrived at the Westin on a lovely Sunday afternoon.  No one met our taxi to assist with bags, nor did anyone in the entry / lobby area offer any assistance.  After a short wait in line as one desk clerk and one ""Concierge""  checked people out, we were greeted for check-in.  We had two rooms booked with reward points.  One was ready and the other was not.  No problem, other than the fact that the very nice young lady checking us in was also answering the phone and using a hand radio to repeatedly request ""Service Express"" to no avail, all while we patiently waited to complete check-in. The fact that only one room was ready certainly occurs often enough and was not a problem at all.  After we carried all of our bags to the room, my wife and I decided to venture out while my daughter chose to rest for a while in the room.  Upon exiting we requested a map from the ""Concierge"" who dutifully reached under the desk and handed a map to us and promptly answered his phone.  Well, we got the map we asked for, nothing beyond. For the balance of our stay we found the rooms to be nicely fitted and many members of the staff to be very pleasant and helpful.  There were two additional items that failed to meet expectation; there is no express cleaning service (3 hour dry cleaning/laundry) as most higher end hotels offer and we had consistent issues with the wireless reception.  Upon check-out I mentioned both issues. Of course, not much can be said of the laundry service other than it was noted.  In regards to the internet, I was informed that they were very full these past couple of days and the internet did not have sufficient bandwidth to manage.  I have no way of verifying if this is accurate, but I can suggest that no hotel should be burdened by being full, unless they are in business to fill less than rooms than they have to offer.  
Overall we enjoyed our stay and felt that the location of the property was superb.  There were several staff members who did provide the service we expected and were most enjoyable to deal with.  In closing, I would suggest that the Westin Dublin is working hard to be a great hotel, but it has not met that standard just yet.",4,2012,07,21
202,"Amazing service, terrific hotel","Here are my top priorities in hotels: cleanliness, good beds, reliable wireless, AC that really cools, and a fitness center that is 24/7.   The Westin has all of those qualities, plus outstanding location, good restaurants, and a staff that recognize platinum members in a way that makes all other hotels pale.  The staff were attentive, helpful, acknowledged my status consistently and repeatedly.  One small gripe...pillows could be a bit more robust.  Otherwise, I have a new favorite place to stay in future trips to Dublin.",5,2012,07,18
202,Quality hotel,Utilized the stay 3 get 1 free promotion which was helpful.  Rooms are spacious and beautiful.  Hotel is in a wonderful location with relatively low noise levels coming from the streets.  Service is excellent and everyone was friendly and helpful from the concierge to the bar managers.  The mint is staffed by some younger people who don't show much motivation or attention to good service.  Go to the pub down the street instead for a drink.  Laundry service is also ridiculously expensive.  Exercise room is decent as well.  I would stay here again.,4,2012,07,18
202,Great (and quiet) place in center of action,"fantastic hotel. clean, spacious rooms. stayed on second floor facing main street (and Temple Bar) and still found it to be quiet. easy walking distance to everything, friendly, helpful staff. Food in Mint Bar was good and reasonably priced. I left my sweater in my room, I emailed them and they immediately took action. would stay again and recommend it to anyone.",5,2012,07,18
202,Excellent stay,"Lovely hotel, well situated for business and shopping.  I've stayed here many times over the past few years and never been disappointed with the room and facilities.  High quality hotel, usually at a very competitive rate and right next door to Trinity College and Grafton Street shopping.  Food is excellent and even room service offering is very good and rapid.  Sometimes in the enthusiasm for reception staff to help guests, check in and out can be slow.",5,2012,07,18
202,Lovely hotel,"Beautiful big room with amazing comfy bed. Very conveniently located for all the major sights, near the city tour bus stop etc. Perhaps slightly more expensive than I would normally go but very pleasant nonetheless.",5,2012,07,17
202,"Beautiful hotel, wonderful staff","This is truly a wonderful hotel!
The location is superb, right in the center, steps away from Trinity College, Temple bar and everything else. It's also very convenient because many busses stop by Trinity College, so you can easily get around Dublin.
The moment you step into the hotel you realize how nice and well kept it is. The reception area is large, the staff at the desk is very kind and helpful, and there are clear signs to find your way around the hotel. The elevators are fast, I never had to wait to get to the upper floors.
Rooms are wonderful, I was in a standard room overlooking the atrium lounge which was large and perfectly appointed. The comfort is what you can expect from a Westin - fantastic bed, beautiful bathroom with bath tub and a very large shower, and very good amenities.
The atrium lounge is a bar in the covered inner courtyard of the hotel. It's a great place to have a drink, a snack or meet someone before heading out. My room was on the first floor facing the atrium but I didn't hear any noise at all.
There's a business center just next to the lounge with 2 computers with internet access, and they are free to use. Very handy since wifi access at the hotel is rather expensive, alas.
The Exchange restaurant on the ground floor is great, the food is very good, reasonably priced (I had dinner there one night and I paid ‚Ç¨30 for an appetizer and main course plus a glass of wine, all excellent). They serve breakfast as well, and you can also just get some pastries to go for a few euros if you don't want to have the full breakfast. This is a great option if you want to have a small breakfast, and it's considerably less expensive that the full breakfast.
In the room there's a coffee maker and kettle, with different sorts of teas and coffee.
The hotel has also a good gym with treadmills, weights and other machines. It's not very big, but in perfect state and with enough equipment to keep you busy as long as you wish.
The staff and the service are excellent - I had a small problem with the switch of one of the lamps and it was immediately fixed by the staff.
So this is definitely a fantastic hotel in Dublin, highly recommended.",5,2012,07,17
202,Westin Dublin!!!!,"This is a great hotel from top to bottom. I have stayed in 5 star hotels throughout the world and this is truly a great hotel! The location could not be better. Located just across the street Temple Bar and a short 5 minute walk to Grafton Street. The hotel itself is fantastic! The rooms are all very nice, updated and big! It's not a huge hotel but much bigger than any botique hotel. As a result it is very comfortable with all the amenities of large resorts. The staff couldn't be more gracious, respectful and helpful. They seem to make it a priority to know your name and check in time to time to make sure everything is OK but not at an annoying rate. I've stayed at this hotel 4 or 5 times and I won't stay at a different hotel in Dublin. I've stayed at the Four Season Dublin and while it is a nice hotel, the Westin Dublin beats it in all aspects (staff, location, price, etc....) Don't miss this hotel!  Thomas Los Angeles",5,2012,07,16
202,To have wedding here or not??!,"Myself and my other half have been considering having out wedding at the Westin hotel but I am concerned by a couple of things. 

I have been reading reviews regarding service at breakfast and in the bar - I'm surprised this isn't fixed immediately as its a small thing and can make a huge difference. We went ourselves for lunch soon, we went to the bar downstairs and it was almost empty (with zero atmosphere) yet it took over an hour to serve us a bowl of soup. I was tryin to get the waiters attention for a good 10 minutes to no avail, the bar manager walked past us a lot of times but again we couldn't get his attention. He then processed to stand and read the paper. This service issue should be second to none in a 5* Hotel. As should a continuous atmosphere in the bar. Like the shellbourne has. 

I've also heard that the residence bar will not be open after the wedding?? 

Anyone any experiences regarding this? 

Thanks, 
Sharon

202,Amazing! One of my all-time favorite hotel stays,"Our family of four stayed here for two nights. The hotel has a wonderful location in the heart of the city, close to the Temple Bar area, the university, Grafton street, etc. It's a great base for exploring the city. There is a Tesco grocery store less than 5 minutes away (walking), with all the essentials for families with small children. 

The staff at the Westin Dublin was top-notch. We had reserved a suite to accommodate our family, and the helpful reception staff made sure we received a room that would be appropriate for our young children. Some of the suites in this hotel have stairs, so we were given a suite that is all on one level.

The suite itself was the nicest hotel room I've ever stayed in. The suite had a large bedroom and large living room. The suite was very recently renovated, with brand new-looking carpets with not a stain to be found on them. The marble bathroom was huge and spotless just like the rest of the suite.

Every detail about this hotel was just right. The towels were the fluffiest hotel towels I've ever encountered. The shower sprayed water at a constant temperature. The curtains were thick enough to make the room dark on a summer day with daylight at 10pm. I could have spent a week or longer here. It was that comfortable for our family.",5,2012,07,14
202,"Great hotel, terrific location","We loved this hotel.  It was well staffed and the accomidations were better than expected.  This was an ideal location just across from Trinity College and very accessible to everything.  We hopped-on-and-off the bus and toured everywhere we wanted to go.  I would definitely reccommend this location and overall experience. Being Americans, we appreciated the modern conveniences as well.",5,2012,07,09
202,Convenient location,"Friendly, clean, nice remodeled rooms.  Great breakfast buffet.  They charged for internet use.   Close to many of Dublin's sights.  They recommended Elephant and Castle restaurant which was excellent and only 2 blocks away.",4,2012,07,08
202,"Location, Comfort and Helpful staff = Excellent Stay","Our two night stay was in elegant, clean and comfortable surroundings. The friendly and helpful staff was most welcome after hours of travel. Desk and atrium personnel were helpful in assisting with global phone use and early check in. The very close proximity to Temple Bar, Hop On And Off Bus and Trinity College were pluses. We are returning for our last  two night stay  in beautiful Ireland.",5,2012,07,06
202,Wonderful service.  The saved our first few nights.,"Due to Number 31 denying our confirmed reservation, we were lucky enough to get rooms at The Westin.  One of the friends we were travelling with had points, and the bent over backwards to get and keep us in a room despite what seemed like all of Dublin being booked due to several concerts and a convention.  

Great job Westin!

It is very centrally located as well.",5,2012,07,05
202,Great location,"We stayed for two nights on our family tour of Ireland. Within walking distance to many of the area attractions.  We found the staff to be very helpful.  Even offering umbrellas for the daily rain event.  We did not eat at the motel, as we found a convenient store closeby for breakfast foods.",4,2012,07,04
202,Abysmal,"Very disappointing experience! If this was a school report, your teacher would write ""could do much much better!""
 I'm Irish and stayed here for two nights with my Australian girlfriend and I have to say I was embarrassed to see what passes as 5 star in Ireland these days...

Each of the following problems can be blamed on individual staff members but in truth I think the real issues are due to poor management, and as such can probably be traced backwards up to senior management level.

Breakfast - no bowls, we asked, we waited. Then, no plates, we asked again, we waited. While we ate our meal, not a single finished table was cleared. That's right, not one in 45 mins. The breakfast manager seemed to think it was beneath her to clear a table, so, we sat surrounded by an ocean of dirty plates all through breakfast. A breakfast incidentally that cost us an extra 40 euros even though we had paid 400 euros for a suite!

Wifi - not free? Seriously guys, have you heard about the Internet ? Again, what clientele are you expecting to attract? 15 euros a day for Internet? We stayed in 60 euro B+B places with complimentary wifi and 400 euro a night places like you try and extract an extra 15 euros!

Cocktail bar - billed as award winning! Then, I looked at your certificates and they were backdated 2004 and 2007. This bar was a disgrace. We attended on a thursday night. It wasn't busy yet we had 20 min waits for drinks. Also, again, like the breakfast experience, no glasses were cleared and the bar was stacked up with dirty glasses. Excusable maybe on a busy night, but not when the staff were sitting around chatting. My girlfriend works in hospitality and noted how clear it was that they merely lacked guidance and a proper bar manager to keep them on their toes.

Check-in - I had initially booked 1 night but needed to book a second night as our plans changed and I thought it would be a hassle to swap hotels, but as it turned out, it was a hassle to stay as I had to check out and then check in again as they couldn't seem to work the computer otherwise.

Look, I'm not saying there was cockroaches, or that the bed linen was dirty etc, but you can't call yourselves a 5 star hotel and then provide a 1 star experience. The building is centrally located but you can't rely on location alone. Let's lift our game guys and show the rest of the world how the Irish can do hospitality like no other!!!",1,2012,07,03
202,Comfort Heaven!,"My partner booked this 2 day break as a treat for us in May. I had never been to Dublin before and was looking forward to soaking up all that this fair city had to offer. The location was excellent, straight off the bus from the airport and within a short walk to all the major tourist areas.
We arrived early form Manchester and were so pleased that we could check straight into our room at 10.30am, a welcome relief after such an early start to the day!
I love everything Art Deco and marvelled at the wonderful marble bathroom!
The room was spacious, quiet, clean and very comfortable.... The heavenly bed was amazing!
I have a guest house in a very quiet part of the Lake district, and am spoiled by peace and quiet, so to find this on holiday is perfect for me to relax and unwind!
The staff in the bar were very professional, fiendly and helpful - We loved sampling the different gins and tonics! We fancied Tapas the first evening and the staff were very knowledgeable about the area and able to recommend a few places to us. The second night we booked to eat in ""Fire"", which was splendid, as was the Cafe en Seine on Dawson Street where we sampled our first Guiness!  
I wish we could have stayed longer to sample the delightful afternoon teas which looked very intruiging from the menus... was it a choice of traditional or quirky?!! 
We had croissants and coffee in bed the first morning but went to the restaurant for breakfast on the second day, which was a little disappointing....  
On the whole a very pleasant stay and I would stay here again when next in Dublin.....
We have since booked the Westin Grand in Berlin and can't wait for a good night's sleep in a heavenly bed and a nice long lie in!",5,2012,07,01

Wow! This is by far the nicest hotel room(s) we have ever stayed in. The furnishings, bed and bath fixtures were all top notch. There are 6 full height arched windows with a balcony. My impression is that this is by far the nicest and biggest suite in the hotel and we were just lucky to have it allocated to us. The twin room was also very spacious. Staff were friendly and accomodating. The bar and lounge were very nice.",5,2012,06,28

The Westin was located across the street from Trinity College, and was within walking distance of Temple Bar, Dublin Castle, Christ Church, and many other Dublin attractions.  Excellent service and buffet breakfast.  Only thing was that we were charged 30 Euros for Internet, where everywhere else we stayed in Ireland, the internet was free (even the small inns we stayed in)",5,2012,06,23
202,"""Rest Easy""?","My wife and I have been loyal Starwood Members since 2003 and fortunate to have Elite status for 4 years now. During this time we have enjoyed many fabulous experiences across their member hotels. The Westin brand has always been our favorite and the Westin Dublin lived up to most of our expectations.

I'll start with the positives: 1.) FABULOUS location, stumbling distance to the Temple Bar area 2.) the hotel's Atrium Bar is a beautiful spot to unwind or enjoy afternoon tea. (the Peculiar Tea menu is fantastic. Two words: Gin Mojito). 3.) Heavenly bed was indeed heavenly 4.) Helpful and courteous porters. They undertook the daunting task of moving our 7 bags of luggage. (we are relocating to Ireland for several months and Dublin was our temporary base)

Now onto the not so positives. Traveling to Ireland from Philadelphia, PA is a journey to say the least, and by the time we arrived at the Westin (approx. 9:30am on June 1st), my wife and I were a bit delirious from the jet lag. Despite requesting an early check-in with our reservation, we were told that there were no rooms currently available. However, if we PAID for one of their upgraded rooms we could check-in immediately. This was perplexing since one of the benefits of our Gold Status is an upgraded room based on availability. So clearly upgraded rooms were available, but only for a FEE. We challenged the front desk agent briefly about this, but felt the fight was not worth it since we were both beyond exhaustion. The front desk agent then told us we would be able to get into our room in about two hours. We again suppressed our rage because of exhaustion. The agent suggested going out to eat or tour the city, these options were not appealing since we only wanted a bed. We declined her suggestion and told her we would wait right there in the lobby until our room was available. We were making ourselves at home and settling in for a nap when MIRACULOUSLY a room opened up! (about 10 minutes later) Hmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm. The agent's reaction was ""You never know how quickly these rooms get ready!"" Her comment was simply not genuine...and I hope that for Starwood's sake that she was simply not well experienced/trained rather then being ignorant as it came across.

But our poor experience with the front desk did not end with our arrival; our checkout experience (June 4th) was also a disappointment. Our bill portfolio was handed to us in an envelope. Luckily we opened it and inspected the bill because we noticed that we were charged for a three-night stay, when our reservation was booked as pay for two, receive a third night free. When we notified the agent of the mistake, she offered no apology and seemed annoyed that we had questioned the bill. After making the fix, we received a new bill, but still no apology.

To add further insult to injury, a few days later, I reviewed the bill again and saw that we were charged 29.00 Euro for ""Refreshment Centre Bev."" I'm assuming this charge was from the bottle of wine, I slightly touched in the mini bar. We must have overlooked this upon checkout because we were too busy dealing with the room overcharge. So two words of warning: 1.) Review your bill thoroughly and 2.)Don't touch ANYTHING in the mini bar unless you are prepared to be charged.

Normally, the staff at Starwood properties (especially Westins) go out of their way to make you feel appreciated, either by offering a smile and enthusiastic greeting or recognizing you as a Gold Preferred Guest upon check-in. Neither of which occurred during our visit. Certainly, most Starwood staff would admit to a mistake or apologize when the experience is not ideal - we didn't get that ""warm and fuzzy"" vibe at all here. There were a few exceptions, namely the porters and the bar tenders. The trio on staff in the Mint Bar during the evening of June 3rd was fantastic! When I told them of my peanut allergy, they immediately came back and offered me a bowl of chips without me even asking. THANKS GUYS! I'm just sorry, I never wrote down their names.

This stay will by no means stop us from staying at Starwood properties; this was probably (we hope) a one off. But, I can't help but feel cheated a bit from my ""REST EASY"" experience that the Westin boasts. In addition, I'm a bit cautious about recommending this property to our friends who will be traveling to Ireland to visit us during the upcoming summer months.",2,2012,06,22
202,Five Star = Average.,"I had high hopes for the Westin, based on the price and the promised ""5 star classic luxury"", but was decidedly disappointed.  

There's no doubt it has a great location, the rooms are very pleasant, clean, comfortable and no one can deny that their ""Heavenly beds"" are fantastic but....I struggled to find the luxury.  Provisions in the room were fairly basic for example they don't provide slippers (personally these are a must for me, nothing as off putting as having to walk barefoot on a carpeted floor that has seen thousands of feet before yours), the standard of finish in public spaces needs attention and the breakfast, besides being expensive, was on the first day average and on the second terrible (service at breakfast was poor too). 

I have stayed in four star hotels where the standard of luxury is just leagues ahead of the Westin. Perhaps it is all down to my own preconceptions based on cost, (Dublin prices being what they are perhaps the Westin is already at a disadvantaged) but I was so very underwhelmed during our two night stay.",3,2012,06,20
202,"Nice Hotel, Good Location","Nice, Quiet, Clean and Very Good Location,close to shops, restaurants, pubs and bus.  Suggest taking bus to / from airport.  Helpful Staff.",4,2012,06,14
202,Very nice hotel and great location,"The room was very nice, the location was great, and the people were wonderful!",5,2012,06,11
202,"Perfect location, close to everything!","Chose to stay at the Westin Dublin as the starting point of our 8-day vacation in Ireland - great decision! The hotel was perfectly located - just a few minutes walk to Temple Bar area, Trinity College, O'Connell St Bridge, shopping/Grafton St, HOHO busses, etc. We knew it was close but maps didn't do it justice, having never visited the city before. Service was excellent, rooms were very clean and comfortable. We were able to check-in mid-morning after the night flight from JFK which was such a relief. Our atrium double room was spacious and very quiet.
The beds at the Westin were the best we had all week! We stayed at B&B's throughout the country for the rest of the trip and while they were spotlessly clean and wonderful in many ways, every one had beds like concrete slabs. 
Our only frustration was that we didn't know the lights in the room were controlled by a room key devise just inside the doorway - took us a while to figure it out and reception never mentioned it. 
Highly recommend the Westin.",5,2012,06,10
202,Not Treated Well At The Westin,"After reviewing photos of the Westin's rooms on its website, my husband booked a junior suite to celebrate our 25th wedding anniversary SEVEN months in advance of our arrival in Dublin. One week before we checked in, he also personally met with a representative at the front desk to reserve a parking space in the hotel's parking garage after we returned from our visit to Cork. She assured him that this would not be a problem, quoted him the nightly parking fee and verified the information under our reservation booking. Unfortunately, when we arrived at the hotel several days later, we were abruptly informed at curbside that the hotel parking lot was full, that it did not matter whether we had reserved a parking space in advance and were instructed to find a parking spot at another garage. While my husband scrambled to locate the garage, I waited in a long line at the front desk, which was only manned by one person. Instead of a junior suite, we were given a ""writer's room"" and were forced to pay the same rate as the much larger, individually decorated junior suite that we had looked forward to staying in. The ""writer's room"" was sub par with a non-functional layout. No explanation was given by the hotel; my assumption was that a large wedding party and their guests took over most of the rooms in the hotel before we arrived. When we departed, there was no one to assist us with our bags to the car. I ended up loading the car myself. The only positive comment I can give the Westin is its location. What a letdown. Next time we will stay at the Shelbourne.",2,2012,06,07
202,Great hotel in a perfect location,Staff was very friendly.  Hotel and room were beautiful.  Service was great!  PLUS!  You cannot beat the location as it is in the center of all the activity in Dublin!,5,2012,06,05
202,"Best place to stay in Dublin, but check in a bit of a hassle","We stayed in two other hotels and a B&B while in Ireland. This hotel was lovely. I travel a great deal for work and this is one of the nicer hotels I've stayed in period. We got an upgraded suite. I was told by a friend who had stayed here previously, that if you book a standard room, it will be an interior room without windows. So, we went with the upgrade. The room was huge and the bathroom was spa-like. It had a large jacuzzi tub and a glass enclosed shower. Marble throughout. The room had been a part of a recent renovation and you could tell. The decorative touches were right on the mark. The negatives- check in process was really chaotic. We drove up and were told we had to park at a city lot because the garage was full. Exactly what we wanted to hear after 3 hrs of driving and being at the end of the trip. As we waited for someone to help with our bags, two additional staff members proceeded to tell us the same thing. It took about 30 minutes at least to have our luggage brought in. We then had to wait for about another 30 minutes to check in and I was a preferred member but it was not much quicker than those who weren't. 

But, all in all the room was amazing. We stayed at the Conrad Dublin another night and this was above and beyond better than that hotel. Expensive---but the room was very nice. Excellent location right by Temple Bar and although we were abutting the main street, we didn't hear a thing. Sound proofing was excellent.",5,2012,06,04
202,Great place to stay in Dublin,Had a great stay at this hotel in early April.  We would highly recommend it to anyone looking for somewhere to stay in Dublin.  The staff was top notch and the rooms were beautiful.  It is very centrally located--great shopping was right within walking distance.  We would also recommend dinner at the Exchange Restaurant--be sure to order the Beef Cheeks.,5,2012,06,03
202,Great experience,Only stayed there one night but was pleased. Comfortable room and great service. Located near many restaurants and shops.,5,2012,06,03
202,"treated like royalty, even when redeeming points","We first stayed at the Westin Dublin for a weekend getaway while living in Belfast, using Starwood points. We were very impressed first with the rate (Priority Club charges about 3x the number of points for an equivalent hotel) and then with everything about the hotel. Having moved back to the states, we stay now stay at the Westin each year for one or two nights before leaving Ireland. What impresses me most is that we are treated with the same professional, friendly service as a paying guest. We have received upgrades, have had requests for rooms with outside views accommodated, have had complimentary fruit delivered to our room, have had excellent service from the concierge, have had quick, friendly service on check-in and check-out. Our experience with the breakfast buffet is that while it is quite expensive (around 20 euro), it is excellent. We are glad to hear that free wi-fi will be coming soon; like most pricey hotels, the Westin charges for that at present. In short, an outstanding hotel. 

This year we weren't able to secure a standard room and will be paying twice the points for a library suite. While we hope that a standard will open up at a lower point rate, part of me can't wait to experience the suite!",5,2012,06,01
202,Better alternatives in town,Asked for a quiet room but could not get to sleep until 2am because of TV noise through the vent. No slippers in room (!). ‚Ç¨15 for 24h wifi - in a business hotel! Location central but right on busy street. Breakfast v good. Room large enough. Complimentary water but no glasses.,3,2012,06,01
202,Wonderful,This hotel is in a fantastic location. It's a beautiful hotel. The rooms are nicely decorated and the staff are friendly and helpful. The food is great. Can't wait to go back.,5,2012,06,01
202,Great Location. Amazing staff,"This is the best location in Dublin. To our left is Trinity College. To our right, a block away is the major shopping district and across the street is the bus to the airport leaving every 15 mins for 7 Euros. Temple bar is a few blocks away from the hotel and you are close to many restaurants.
You can walk virtually anywhere from here.
Staff go out of their way to be helpful and obviously enjoy working there
Rooms are updated and very spacious for European standards",5,2012,05,29
202,Westin Hotel in Dublin,"The location of this hotel can't be beat. It's in the heart of Dublin and within walking distance to all attractions. The main shopping area is about 1/2 block away as well as restaurants and pubs. The bus station is across the street from the hotel. Rooms are very large and updated. We had breakfast included in our rate.It was a hot buffet with not just eggs and bacon. It was a large spread with all kinds of meats, cheeses and cooked dishes. The staff was helpful and attentive whenever we asked for directions or needed advice.I was not charged to print boarding passes for our flights as it was included. Not sure if other internet services were free. It was more than we wanted to spend but what we saved on taxis and bus fare was worth the money.",5,2012,05,28
202,Many good things but 15 Euro Wifi,"The location is terrific, the rooms are nice, staff friendly but...... At the end of a weeks tour of Ireland, the most expensive hotel wanted 15 Euro for 24 hours  of Wifi, no other hotel we stayed charged (and we stayed at hotels, Inns and B&B'sh . It just leaves a bad taste.  
On the bright side the location is exceptional, across the road from Temple Bar, Grafton Street, O'Connell Strret are right there. The Mint bar downstairs is a good hang out spot for a nightcap if you can tear yourself away from the fun at Temple Bar.
The Wedin group needs to look at their wifi policy, if you travel first class you should not have to be nickel and dimed. There are lots of good alternatives in Dublin!

202,Great location & fab staff!,"Love this Westin location, staff & dining. Would highly recommend & will stay again. Close walk to Temple Bar, Trinity College & hop on hop off bus stops.

202,Dublin Stay,"From the moment we checked in to the time we checked out, staff were very friendly and accommodating. All the staff members we encountered were approachable and always willing to answer any questions we had. The location was central and close to the tourist information center. We were able to walk to most attractions. Would definitely stay here again if visiting Dublin.",5,2012,05,24

202,Westin Dublin,"Excellent location close to shops, clubs, and Trinity University. The hub of the action if you are walking. Service is superb. Room is clean, bright, and cheery. My wife had a cold and the staff was very attentive to her needs. The bar actually knows how to make a mixed drink such as a Manhatten which is rare for European bars. The concierge was invaluable in planning excursions, etc.",5,2012,05,22
202,"Great hotel, location and staff","I stayed at the Westin Dublin in March 2012.  The location is perfect!  It is at the Temple Bar district, O'Connell Street, one block from the ""hop on-hop off"" bus stop, next to Trinity College and within walking distance to many restaurants, pubs, shopping and two Starbucks:)  The hotel itself is fabulous!  It is the nicest hotel I have stayed at in all of Europe so far:)  Very comfortable bed and spacious room.  The staff was fantastic as well.  Although we did not eat or drink at the hotel much, there was a nice restaurant and a couple of nice bars.",5,2012,05,20
202,A mixed experience....,"The hotel couldn't be more central; perfect for just a couple nights in Dublin without time to familiarize one's self with the rail systems.  I stayed here in November 2011, travelling with my parents who were to meet my husband's family who still reside in Ireland.  The hotel has a great door man, Peter who recommended seeing Trim on our way North to Donegal.  After leaving, I was disgusted to find that I had been charged 30 euro for a five minute phone call to a Dublin phone number.  As much help as the girls at the front desk were, they didn't have the authority to reverse the charges when I returned a few days later; nor was anyone willing to grant them the authority.
After leaving, I expressed my feelings on Hotels.com and was contacted by Diego Roggero, who is a manger there.  He was happy to refund the excess charges, and dealt with me directly in a very professional manner.  In the end, a very positive experience in customer service.
Thank you Peter and Diego!",3,2012,05,18
202,Terrific location and wonderful concierge service,The location of the Westin is within walking distance to all you need to see in Dublin.  From the moment we arrived the staff was pleasant and accommodating.   We were given an Interior room which was quiet from the street traffic but a bit warm. Concierge Michael Byrne's was  extremely helpful with his warm and delightful personality  he clearly loves his job and does it well.  My husband and I hope to return with our children in the future.  Overall the hotel offers exceptional service with a terrific location.,5,2012,05,18
202,Excellent Location and Service,"The Westin is in an excellent location next to Trinity College.  It is a short walk to sites, shopping and Temple Bar.  Check in was a breeze and the staff provided good recommendations for dinner.  The room was spotless and included an American plug at the desk.  The bartenders at The Mint downstairs were great.",5,2012,05,16
202,Afternoon tea,stopped by for afternoon tea on our recent trip to Dublin! Well worth the money absolutely amazing quality and taste! Will do it again when back in Dublin!,5,2012,05,15
202,GREAT location!,"This hotel is in the best location in Dublin.  You can walk to most of the major sites and the ones that are a bit further you can easily access with the Hop On/Hop Off bus tour.

Reception upon arrival was very friendly.  We were welcomed by a gal who was ""in training"" and she checked us in promptly.  We booked a deluxe room on Starwood points and were offered an upgrade for 25 Euros/night.  There was also a few options of freebies with the upgrade so we took the free WIFI access (which is normally 15 Euros/day).  The only problem we ended up having was we were told breakfast was included with the upgrade.  The woman told my husband this and then I asked a second time as this sounded to good to be true (the full Irish breakfast is almost 20 Euros/per person.  She did indeed say yes again when I asked her.

The variety of food offered at breakfast was very good but the hot items were lukewarm at best even though they were in chafing dishes.  When the bill was delivered the first morning, it showed a charge of 39 Euros.  I told our server that we were told our breakfast was included in the room rate and she said ""not to worry"".  It shows as 39 Euros just so ""they can keep track"" of how many people were served.  Fair enough - I crossed out the amount but added a 15% gratuity and away we went.

We had breakfast there the second and third mornings too.  The afternoon before we were to check out, my husband went to reception to have a look at our charges so we weren't rushing to do it in the morning when we were to check out.  Sure enough, we were charged 39 Euros each morning for three mornings for breakfast.  My husband told the woman at the desk (not the one that checked us in) that we were told twice that our breakfast was included.  She cooly said it was not.

Needless to say we grabbed a couple of croissants from TESCO that afternoon and had them in our room the morning of departure with our Starbucks instant Vias we had with us - there was a kettle in the room so it was easy to make an early cup of coffee until the actual Starbucks opened.  So for about 1.50 Euros we had a fresh cup of coffee and croissant instead of a lukewarm 39 Euro breakfast in the hotel.  You can do the math...

On that note, the service is excellent, especially in The Mint Bar in the basement (thank you David - you're a dream) as was the food in the bar.  Will stay again when in Dublin.",4,2012,05,15
202,We made the best choice by choosing the Westin,"Michael the concierge could tell just by talking to us what sites/restaurants we'd enjoy, even though we didn't know ourselves, being our first time in Dublin. He went out of his way to ensure we'd have a great trip. The room was roomy and gorgeous, and more importantly, very clean. There was always hot water and good  pressure in the shower, and fluffy towels. Breakfast was elegant, many choices and well worth the price.  The staff throughout the hotel was friendly and helpful. No complaints, couldn't ask for better, and the price per night was more than reasonable for an upscale, centrally located hotel. The hoppa bus stop was a quick walk, the tourist info shop was across the corner, also very close to Trinity College.",5,2012,05,14
202,Dublin great hotel -great location,"The Westin Hotel on Westmoreland St is in the perfect location; steps away from Trinity College and Temple Bar; walking distance to Grafton and O'Connell shopping areas and many other sites. (This location will save you on taxi fares);  Many daytime tour buses are one block away. Clean, with an attentive staff. Two restaruants with good food and good service; and an atrium lounge which serves high tea.  Also in-room dining with extensive menu.  I had an issue with my room and they moved me right away. In-room spa services. I highly recommend it.",4,2012,05,14
202,Old school glamour without being dated.,"From the minute we checked in we were happy. The day we arrived was cold and raining but when we walked in the hotel was warm and welcoming and the checkin was smooth.

The bed was amazing, so too the pillows and the shower. Our bathroom alone was bigger than our hotel room in Paris!

If you want to be in the middle of the action of Dublin than then this is the place to stay. Restaurants, pubs, tourist attractions are all on your doorstep.

Thanks for a great experience.",5,2012,05,14

202,3rd times a charm,"We have stayed at the Westin Dublin three times.  First and second with my husband and the third time with our two boys, ages 9 & 11.  This is a beautiful, classy hotel.  Most of the Westin's we have visited have been pretty amazing. The location cannot be beat, right in the heart of Dublin's City Center.  Trinity college across the street, One end of Temple Bar steps away and Graften Street only about a block and a half away.  
The bed is heavenly.  The rooms are open, spaceous and clean.  Bathroom beautiful.  You may be wondering why only a 4 star rating.  Well, on our third visit, we brought our boys.  I reserved a suite (larger and more $$) because I was told that the sofa that came with the room would fold out to a bed for my kids to sleep in.  When we arrived, they informed us that there were no fold out sofa bed in the suites.  But they would be have to bring in a roll away cot.  Initially they planned to charge me for the cot.  But I expressed dismay, as I had already paid for a much more expensive room in order to accomadate my off-spring, so ultimately, they did not charge me.  A big hotel chain such as The Westin really should make it possible for a family of 4 to travel together without so much hassle.  
The doorman at the front door is my favorite thing about the hotel.  He was there all three visits and he was charming, friendly and helpful each time.",4,2012,05,11

202,"Classical style, very friendly staff, excellent service, great location","This hotel is in a great location, close to loads of the main sights and bang in the middle of the shopping areas. We stayed here for 2 nights for a pre birthday mini break.
The check in staff were lovely and upgraded our room on arrival.
They also sent me up a little birthday cake and had iced the plate with a message.
Our room was spacious and the furniture is quite classic, but it's all beautifully decorated with good quality soft furnishings. There are also tea making facilities in the room.
Lovely big bathroom with seperate shower and nice toiletries. When we called down to reception to request extra tea, the service was very prompt.
Conceirge was also very helpful and booked some excellent restaurants for us.
On the second morning we asked if we could have our room past the checkout time and they 
Let us have the room for a few more hours.
We didn't have breakfast, because it wasn't included in our room rate, so would suggest getting this included prior to your stay. However, there are loads of great coffee houses and restaurants within walking distance. Would definately stay here again, only thing i would like to change would be the weather!",4,2012,05,07
202,Wonderful City Centre Location!,"We had such a wonderful time whilst in Dublin for our 5th anniversary!  The staff was WONDERFUL and helped us get dinner reservations at The Winding Stair on our last night in Dublin.  I'd definitely stay here again.  My only con is I wish they had free Wi-Fi, it went down for about 12 hours during out stay, but we were refunded for the down time.",5,2012,05,06
202,Great Place,"I stayed at the Westin Dublin in April. The loacation is FANTASTIC! Out the front door is the Green Hop on Hop Off, Trinity College, Temple Bar Area, Graffton St, and Starbucks.Great service, and room. I can't imagine a better loction. Book it if you are going to Dublin! Only reason I didn't give a five is because I very rarely do, but it was very close.",4,2012,05,06
202,SPG Member who?,"As a life loyal SPG member, going on 10+ years, the check in experience was nothing but neutral to bad experience at best. Thus asking,  SPG member who?
Traveling with a family and tow, and after a long day. I requested a simple upgrade (actually the upgrade request was in the reservation request-via Platinum concierage . Rooms were available for upgrade,  however they wanted to charge me 80 pds(?). I thought that was odd, since my experience when travelling on  business or pleasure an upgrade was typically automatic. 
Why the anger from the front desk? Possibly a bad day?
Regardless, you make the best in your stay. The staff at the restaurant, and cleaning was the best.",3,2012,05,04
202,A Grand Old Lady,"I love the Westin Dublin, The Staff, The Rooms, The Bar, The Doorman, The Bar Staff & The Housekeeping team I love you all. 

A proper Irish Welcome from the best hotel in Dublin, NO Contest.

High recommed this hotel to all.",5,2012,05,03
202,Raving about the Westin Hotel,"The Westin in Dublin is anything but a chain hotel.  It's gracious, beautiful and unbeatably located just steps from Trinity College.  We upgraded for $15 Euros per night to a penthouse room overlooking the college quad with our own little balcony.  Only negatives were the outrageous cost for internet access ($15 Euros a day -- crazy in such a wired country.)  We also didn't like being asked what newspaper we would like in the morning and then being charged for it!  
One tip which was news to us.  EVERYTHING in Ireland is closed on Good Friday -- all theaters, pubs, restaurants, museums and shops.  The only place to eat or drink is a hotel.  Be warned!",4,2012,04,30
202,Pure luxury,Just returned from a great four night stay with breakfast at this hotel. The staff were very friendly and helpful. Breakfast choice was excellent and we had a luxury room which was very nice. Also in a great location. Would recommend this hotel if you want a very comfortable stay in Dublin.,5,2012,04,29
202,Doesn't get any better.....,"After studying law for moths at UCD outside of Dublin, I had my girlfriend meet me in Dublin and we stayed at the Westin.  First off, the Westin is in an amazing part of the the city. Its right beside Trinity college and Temple bar area. Also all the shopping you could want, Grafton st., is right around the coroner. As for the room, it was very spacious and nice. Stayed on the top floor and had a wonderful be and bathroom with great views. Staff was done and helpful for the most part, no complaints here. Overall I had a wonderful stay and would recommend this hotel to anyway. ",5,2012,04,29
202,"Superior service, stunning location, stupendous room.","Check in was one of the BEST experienced in my many years of travel. A helpful staff member took the time to point out all the basics. Service with a genuine smile and willingness to help is the general theme of this property. I didn't come across any staff member who didn't want to be there. It is obvious micro management is in full swing at this hotel. I dont know how or what the managers are doing but it is certainly working. 

Rooms are of decent size and full size bath tub is really appreciated after a long flight from Australia.  The heavenly beds are just that - heavenly. Tea and coffee making facilities were sufficient and so were mini bar offerings. 

Previous reviews regarding Internet should be ignored as I was only charged 8 euro per day for 5 days. This is a very reasonable price and one complaining should go to Australia and see what expensive is!

A few small gripes would include the bath towel size is only Queen. A king bath sheet is normally standard at Westin properties? A large man/woman wouldn't enjoy the size of the towels. Also, security on Friday and Saturday nights are a little over zealous. The G.M informed me that the company is outsourced and profusely apologized for their behaviour. It didn't make sense only having security on Friday and Saturday? If a crazy wants to get in on a Tuesday what would one do? A small gripe that was sorted but should be looked into be management.

Thanks Westin and special thanks to Jacqueline, Craig, Michael and Lazol? (apologies if spelt wrong!)",5,2012,04,29
202,"Very nice hotel, some minuses regarding fitness center, internet and tv","I stayed at this hotel for 4 nights while on a business trip to Dublin. When I arrived, it was a bit chaotic as computer system were down, but it was settled a few hours later. I was nicely greeted by the staff and they took care efficiently of the checkin. Room was spacious and had all I needed (maybe an ironing board, etc, would have been useful). Beds were comfortable and I slept every night like a baby. I cannot comment on the bar since I did not got but the Exchange restaurant is quite nice and serves some nice food.

Minuses are:
- TV channels are a bit limited, would have appreciated something more complete, like Eurosport, Discovery, National Geographic, History, etc...

- Internet access prices is excessive and speed while OK is not exactly great (especially upstream) and can affect your ability to do work efficiently.

- Fitness center is ""small""..while there is enough equipment, there is just not enough space. It is virtually impossible to use this place efficiently with 3 people. If you happen to do some ground exercises, you're literally blocking the floor for the other members. As amazing as it sounds I had more floor space in my room ! This would really deserve doubling the space.",4,2012,04,28
202,"Overall a great hotel, minus one unusual experience","I just completed a four night stay at the Westin Dublin. The hotel itself is beautiful and the beds and bath are lovely. The location is convenient, and, for the most part, the Atrium Lounge is superb. I ate there twice, and I thoroughly enjoyed my meals, especially the scones and the tea. However, the second time I ate in there I experienced rude service from a waiter. I did bring it to the attention of management, and it is my hope that my experience will not reoccur for future guests, especially since it is not indicative of the rest of the staff in the Atrium. 

I do have to give special kudos to Michael Byrne, the concierge. Michael provided me with great tips for nearby historical sites. His knowledge of Irish history is impeccable, and he is incredibly friendly and helpful. 

I would stay here again, even with the minor faux pas in the Atrium Lounge.",4,2012,04,28
202,Excellent in almost every respect,"First, the only annoyance: charging for internet service. 

These are far outweighed by the good points:

Even though we arrived at 8:00 a.m. after a trans-Atlantic flight, our room was ready for us and we were able to move in

Clean, reasonably sized, well furnished rooms

Wonderful location, a few minutes walk from Grafton Street shopping and Trinity College

Friendly staff who proactively make sure that one's needs and expectations are met

Excellent restaurants each with a distinctive ambiance, reasonable prices (for a top hotel) and good menu variety (tip: book a table in the very pleasant Atrium restaurant because it can get crowded)",5,2012,04,26
202,Great weekend away in my home town,"We stayed in the Westin for a weekend on the occasion of my new Godson's Christening. This was our 4th stay at the Westin and it's my favourite hotel in Dublin at present.

This is a really nice hotel and the location could not be better.  It is right in the centre of Dublin and very close to Trinity College, O'Connell Street and Temple Bar. The staff are excellent and were really helpful at every turn. We had breakfast in the restaurant every morning. This was included in the rate we'd booked though not all rates do. If you don't book breakfast it can be expensive in the hotel.

Our room was under the eaves and we  could see over the roofs of Trinity College from the windows. It wasn't large by any means and the bathroom was almost as big as the room. It was however very well furnished and felt very cosy. We were very happy with it.

I have only one reservation, like many cities Dublin gets very loud on a Saturday night and the street noise from the well lubricated clients of neighbouring establishments along with the attendant sirens from the police kept us awake until the early hours. Miraculously it all went quiet at about 2 or 3am and we slept  soundly thereafter. If you are staying over a Friday or Saturday night it might be worth your while to request one of the rooms that overlook the Atrium rather than the street. Clearly, this is not the hotel's fault, but you should be aware of it. Otherwise we had a perfect stay and we'll probably be back.

One other thing, - this hotel charges for WiFi would you believe. That's quite astonishing for a 5* hotel in 2012. But it worked fine which is a plus.",5,2012,04,24
202,"Top quality, but charging for Internet??","We would have given this one a top rating but for our pet peeve:  charging 15 euros a day for Internet access just seems unconscionable in a country which is well wired for it.  In our 14 nights in Ireland, no other establishment charged for such a service, from moderately priced B&B‚Äôs to top end manors like Longueville House.  But otherwise, the place is near perfect.  We had a large bedroom, large bath (cramped shower like most of Europe), two writing desks, two closets, and great service at the desk.  Our third floor room had been recently renovated, so we were staying in an essentially newly constructed room.  The staff was friendly and helpful, as we found all across Ireland, and the hotel is very conveniently located across the street from Trinity College, within walking distance of nearly everything.  We walked to the National Museum, Gate Theatre, Jameson Distillery, and Patrick Guilbaud Restaurant for an out of this world lunch (and tab!).  A pub called the Oliver St. John Gogarty is a couple of hundred yards away, and if you are interested in live Irish music before 9 o‚Äôclock at night, this is the place.  We went there our last night, and the entertainment was first class on the second floor‚Äîand probably on the first floor, as well.  The food is standard pub fare, but we would have gone there every evening if we had discovered it the first night.  A musical pub crawl starts there at around 7:30, and a couple with banjo and accordion warmed up the crowd and led them out on what we suspect would be a fine time.  We will be recommending it to our travelling friends, for sure.",4,2012,04,24
202,Westin Dublin,"This is a lovely hotel and we stayed for three nights celebrating my husband's special birthday. A slice of cake and a card left in our room for him was a nice touch.  We had a problem trying to get a drink at the end of our evening when the bar had just closed but this was resolved when speaking to the duty manager the next day and a paper ordered did not arrive for us and for friends also staying but these were small issues.   The hotel is close to the sights, has a welcoming ambience and we would most likely stay there again.",4,2012,04,23
202,"Dublin,Ireland= Westin Dublin=Service Extraordinaire","If you want to experience a visit in Dublin, stay at Westin Dublin, worth the price.  You will experience a staff ready to help you in all aspects of your journey, whether it is just Dublin or the Countryside drive.  We worked with them by email and received outstanding service and all questions were answered within 24 hours. Rooms, restaurant, front desk were excellent.  I even received some advise on cd's to buy for local music from the restaurant manager!  I depend on reviews on trip advisor due to a bad hotel experience in Dublin about 10 years ago.  Therefore, now it is important to say due to Westin Dublin's service thoses memories are gone!",5,2012,04,23
202,Fabulous place to stay,"The service, room, food, availability of cocktails, was perfect.  Only thing missing is a pool but who cares.  This is such a great hotel in a good location.",5,2012,04,23
202,Perfect city stay,"Arrived at the hotel starving & frazzled from driving all day; next thing we knew we had a table booked, car parked for us and our stuff sorted, before we even made it to the room. The classic rooms are not huge, but they are very comfortable, and they don't have great views - but hey, you're in the middle of the city! The other room we had actually had quite an interesting view to the atrium lounge in the middle of the building. Rooms are stylish, modern and functional, the location and service hard to beat. Recommended.",5,2012,04,23
202,"Great Location, nice bar","Like others have said , this hotel is in a great location, walking distance to all the sites in Dublin, which is easy since Dublin is small enough that just about everything is walking distance. The hotel is clean our room was quiet 4th floor. The Mint bar is a nice place to go at the end of a long day sampling all Dublin has to offer. We would definitely stay here again",4,2012,04,23
202,Adore! Especially Cocktails!,I Have stayed in this hotel a few times on overnights to dublin! beleive me its worth every penny! complete central location but its so quiet you'd think you were staying in the country! cocktails are amazing! try the whole lot! staff are friendly and very kind! rooms are stunning! modern and comfortable! def a must if your staying in dublin!,5,2012,04,22
202,"Perfect location, great service","Really enjoyed our stay at the Westin Dublin.  Absolutely wonderful location in the heart of where you hope to be while in Dublin.  You're basically at the gates of Trinity College, Temple Bar, Grafton Street & St. Stephens Green.  Dublin is a pretty compact little city  - so it's easy to walk just about anywhere from the Westin. 

The rooms were snug, but well-appointed, clean and super comfortable. The beds were luxuriously outfitted and the bathroom spacious with a separate tub.  Our room had a nice view of the college across the way.  The Atrium has a nice tea menu and a bar.  Mint, downstairs, is good for a nightcap.  The breakfast buffet was satisfying enough, though you'd probably do better ordering a la carte.  All in all, a great property with a smiling, accommodating staff who seem truly happy to greet you and assist you with your requests.  We hope to be back soon.",5,2012,04,21
202,"Fabulous service, great room for the price","Found a great price online (not thru this site, but that was just bc I didn't have the app), and wound up using this as my 'hub' as I traveled around the country. A friend of mine had a room in another local hotel n was shocked at the difference in quality - the Westin was a much nicer hotel and a better value. Good food, nice wine list in the restaurant, valet service was KEY, and it was nice and easy to get in and out of Dublin from here. Everything in town I just took cabs or walked (cheaper to keep car in valet), but it was a wonderful experience. ",5,2012,04,20
202,The best hotel in Ireland,"I cannot fault this hotel, we were so impressed from our welcome to our departure, everyone was attentive but not overpowering, the room and facilities were clean and of a very high quality. The pillows came from dreamland, try them any you will know what I mean! ",5,2012,04,20
202,Marvellous hotel experience,"It was one of the best stays in my life (and due to work conditions I have to travel a lot, minimum of 150 nights per year out of my house...). I stayed there for three months (January-March 2012, over 50 nights there), and the quality of the service could not be better. They made me enjoy each one of the days I spent there, and I really felt at ""home"".

The location of the hotel is excellent (in the middle of Dublin), the workers are lovelly and the rooms are really comfortable (and beleive me, I tried more than 15 of them, one for each week I stayed there). Even the gym (although small) was nice!!

I strongly recommend it if you travel to Dublin!",5,2012,04,19
202,Nice stay on a perfect location,"I stayed with my family in this hotel for the 2012 Easter weekend and everything was arranged as it should be in a 4.5 star hotel . No hassle , clean and comfy rooms, serviceable staff , a delicious breakfast , an excellent room service and a nice bar . I surely recommend this hotel for it's unique location.This saves a lot of time to get to the great spots and transportation sites through the interesting city of Dublin. One small detail that should be taken care of is the fact that the toilets are not ""sustainable"" enough in my concept.They have a deficient flushing power compared to the quantity of water that's been used per flush. But that will surely not spoil a perfectly relaxed stay at this nice hotel.",4,2012,04,15
202,Beautiful hotel,"Absolutely love this hotel!  Beautifully decorated, comfortable bed, charming, helppful staff, good food.  We had continental breakfast every day which was more than enough food and plenty of food choices.  The hotel is across the street from Trinity college and centrally located.  We were able to walk easily to most sights.  We had a room with a queen size bed. It was quiet and clean.  The bathroom was as large as the room and nicely decorated.  Overall a really great experience.",5,2012,04,15
202,"Perfect location, friendly service, very good bar downstairs, but with bathroom errors","We were two adults and one child staying for four nights during Eastern. 5th floor (loft floor) in a very large and newly renovated room with plenty of space for a family. A plus for a free of charge, high quality extra bed. Limited roof space and small windows could be considered as a drawback. Air-condition gave us about 20+ degrees when adjusted to 16 degrees even-though the temperature outside was quite chilly. Generally good sleep quality. A big minus for the bathroom which was rather small, and impractically designed. The shower had only one fixed handle mounted well above head level, and together with an extremely low water pressure made it difficult to have a hygienic body wash. Especially difficult was there to shower a small child. My wife had to wash her hear at a hair dresser because the poor water pressure would have made it almost impossible to do it at the hotel. The rest of the hotel was pretty much like expected from a 5 star hotel except there were nobody to help with the luggage at arrival. Fair restaurant in the ground floor. Not very expensive, good service. The food was good, but far from culinary. The bar downstairs, however was excellent by all means. Great service and with inexpedience, well prepared food. Very friendly service at the front desk was a big plus. Generally a very nice hotel experience, unfortunately with a considerable minus regarding the poor shower possibilities. The breakfast was a bit too pricey for us to try, since they charge a full price for a small child.",4,2012,04,11
202,Great location!,"My boyfriend and I just recently stayed at the Westin Dublin. It is located right next to Trinity Church and Temple Bar. The room was beautiful and clean. The only thing negative I have to say is that I wish the hotel would of informed us when booking that Friday April 6th is a bank holiday and almost everything is closed, restaurants, bars and most attractions. We wasted a day in Dublin not being able to do much and it ruined part of our trip. ",4,2012,04,10
202,Fantastic Weekend Break,"Just back from an excellent weekend break in Dublin.  Stayed at the Westin, Dublin and from the moment we arrived, nothing was too much effort to the staff.  Perfect location for the airlink buses, all the tourist attractions and shopping.  Concierge gave lots of great recommendations (especially being Easter weekend).  Breakfast was great, an extensive buffet and great service, always with a smile.  The Atrium for Saturday afternoon G&T's was also a highlight, a lovely area to relax and catch up with friends.  Rooms were lovely and spacious.  Cannot recommend this hotel and a weekend in Dublin enough.  Will definitely be back.",5,2012,04,09
202,"A lovely hotel, in a fantastic location, with great staff but thin walls.","We stayed at the Westin in Dublin across the Easter weekend. We selected the hotel because of it's location very close to Temple Bar and The River Liffe and also as it is a Starwood property (we are members of Starwood Preferred Guest).

We had an early flight into Dublin and arrived at the hotel at 10am, and the reception team were kind enough to allow us to check into our room then, rather than making us wait until the 3pm check in time. This was greatly appreciated and the staff did not fall below this excellent level of service for the rest of our stay.

Our room was on the fourth floor and faced inwards onto the Atrium. The room was of a good size, with a very comfy bed and pillows, and a nicely appointed bathroom. The mini bar was well stocked with a variety of drinks and chocolates, but could do with a few savoury food selections!

My only issue with the room is that the walls are a little on the thin side and you can sometimes hear some of the more rowdy guests when they are returning to their room in the early hours. 

We had breakfast a couple of times in the Atrium restaurant, which was of a good standard.

All in all, a good stay and I would recommend the Dublin Westin.",4,2012,04,09
202,Superb!!!,"Stunning hotel, rooms were beautiful. Large hallways which I loved. Right in the centre of town beside trinity college. Beds were amazing. Helpful staff.",5,2012,04,08
202,Great Location,"Recently stayed at Westin Dublin for 4 nights with a group of friends.  The location of the hotel is perfect for the first time Dublin visitors.  It's centrally located - a short walk away from the Temple Bar area, Grafton street, and other tourist attractions.  It's also a few minutes away from the DART train stop(recommend taking short day trips to Howth, Dalkey, and Dun Laoghaire if you are there for a few days).  Rooms were big, modern, and clean.  The rates were also very reasonable for a 4/5 star hotel.  Staff was friendly and very helpful. They did seem thinly staffed at times (sometimes it was hard to reach front desk/concierge from the room), but overall, we had a great stay at the Westin.  You do need to pay for Wi-fi, but you do get free 15 minutes per day. You can also go to the Starbucks next door for free wi-fi.  I think the only nicer hotel is the Shelbourne, but Shelbourne is more expensive, and I think the location is better for Westin if you are a tourist. I don't think you can go wrong with staying here.",5,2012,04,07
202,Amazing hotel!,My friend and I stayed at Westin Dublin for 4 nights in April 2012 and we had a brilliant time! The staff were so friendly and helpful and the location of the hotel was perfect for shopping and tourist attractions. Room service was yummy too!  Looking forward to my next visit already!!,5,2012,04,05
202,Good Location,"Stayed with my sister. In a great location, across the road from Temple Bar area. From the moment of check in we were very welcomed, staff were excellent. Would definately stay here again",5,2012,04,05
202,unbelievable!,"We recently stayed at this hotel for a civil partnership, that we were attending. Upon arrival we were greeted by the staff on reception who were lovely, and very well spoken. We were accommodated to our request of being checked in earlier than the usual check in time, for no extra cost, which was brilliant!! When we got to our room, we were very happy, lovely sized room, equipped with a mini bar!!! The decor of the hotel was outstanding, and the food was superb! 5* accommodation at its finest!! My only annoyance would be was that upon arrival my credit card was scanned for authorization only, and upon leaving my partners card had to be swiped to be charged, they ended up charging both cards, and I've had to wait 5 days for my money to be refunded!! However, it still doesn't take away the beauty of the hotel, and visit we had at The Westin.",5,2012,04,03
202,Excellent visit on St. Patrick's Day weekend,The location of this property is excellent!  We arrived the evening of St. Patrick's Day after touring the countryside.  Michael at the door took care of our car -  he was excellent and sent us to a super gastropub in Temple Bar area.  Used Starwood points to upgrade our room -  was very large and was on the 4th floor overlooking a side alley just off the very busy main road.  Despite all the commotion outside with St. Patricks Day night time partying -  our room was still very quiet.  If anything there was more noise that could come through the door to the adjoining room (fortunately the party there ended early).  Enjoyed the bar downstairs -  they had live music.  On Sunday we explored Dublin -  was very easy to walk the city and see all of the sites in Center City from the Westin.  Would definitely stay there again when back in Dublin on business or pleasure.  Earlier in the week I stayed at the Conrad Hotel -  very nice but not quite as nice as the Westin and they don't have Michael!,5,2012,03,31
202,"Second Trip to Dublin, Second Wonderful Stay!","Recently, my husband and I found ourselves in Dublin again. After we booked our flights, there was no hesitation to book our room again at the Westin Hotel in Dublin. Not only were we looking forward to visiting our favorite city, we were also very excited about our stay at the Westin. 

Last June we stayed at the hotel for the first leg of our European honeymoon. Our first wonderful encounter with the Westin was repeated again with our recent stay. We had a gorgeous room with a huge marble bathroom. It is always very clean and the staff is super friendly. I can say with confidence there are few hotels with the quality, value, and the wonderful location that the Westin shares. 

Next time we are in Dublin, and there will be a next time, we will only consider staying at the Westin. Thank you for making our trips so special!!",5,2012,03,31
202,"Lovely hotel, perfect location","Just got back from a lovely long weekend for my husband's birthday at the Westin. The hotel was lovely. Room was extremely comfortable and fairly quiet although the sound proofing does not extend to the corridor which was unfortunate on one night! Staff were very friendly and we arrived back on our first day out to a lovely, completely unsolicited, cake and birthday message which was a delightful suprise! I booked a deluxe room which we loved - it was huge with a gorgeous bathroom although we were a little disconcerted at our 'view' - the window opened straight onto a sloping roof and that was all you could see! The hotel lobby and public areas were well appointed and spotless and the location is second to none! All in all definitely recommend",4,2012,03,31
202,Great Stay!,"We just returned from a great stay in Dublin at The Westin. The location was perfect in the city. Really close to all the major pubs and sights, especially the Tourist Centre on Suffolk Street where pretty much all the tours leave from.

The beds were very comfortable and the bathrooms were amazing with good water pressure. And just a note to anyone that usually packs a travel blow dryer, you really don't need it if you are staying here, it was a pretty quality dryer, I never even used the one I brought.

And they have a incentive if you don't want someone to clean your room, just leave this tag they give you on your door at night and they will leave you a voucher for 5 Euros. We saved up a few and had a nice night cap in the Atrium Lounge on our last night there.",5,2012,03,30
202,Highly Recommend - Business or Pleasure!,"I was part of a large business delegation that stayed at the for approximately one week in March (and returned the following week for pleasure). The hotel was incredible. The rooms are lovely. The common areas are beautiful. The Mint is a lot of fun! And the location couldn't be better. 

The service was second-to-none. From the front desk staff, to the catering staff, to the management...excellent.

I can't wait to go back again.",5,2012,03,29
202,Great hotel,"Not the cheapest but definitly great value for money , great location , great friendly stuff , we got internet and continental boufet included , nice gym room, SPACIOUS rooms, beautiful bathrooms very decorative , and they have TV speakers on them :D, well definitly recommended it go there again.",5,2012,03,29
202,Beautiful Luxury Hotel,This was an old former bank converted into a hotel. The current bar was the previous vault - very cool!! Luxury throughout the hotel and the service was as good as the decor. great location - just across temple Bar area and easy walk to Christ church.,5,2012,03,27
202,Absolutely lovely hotel with a world-class concierge,"This hotel is abolutely awesome! Marble bathrooms, balcony, amazing bed. But one of the biggest reasons I really enjoyed my stay here was the concierge. One of the people who works the concierge desk called Michael went above and beyond to make sure I had all the information I needed. He made the reservations for the bus tours, gave me great restaurant recommendations and not only was he very friendly, but he also made sure to tell me places to avoid while walking around. The hotel has this really nice fireplace and I wanted to sit next to it. There was some technical problem with the fireplace and it wouldn't turn on. Michael made sure to call the Maintenance and it was fixed 10 minutes later. I had a nice fire and a nice book to read. Really made my evening! I really wish more hotels could hire people like him to make hotel stays so much more enjoyable. Definitely ask for Michael if you're staying here(he works the evening shift)",5,2012,03,25
202,OK hotel with very bad service,"Having stayed at the Westin Dublin, my over all experience was ok, not out standing. On arriving at the hotel at 10pm in the evening there was no door man or concierge to help you into the lobby with the luggage, so we had to somehow get our cases around and through the swirl doors, not something you would expect from a 5 star hotel where door men are the doors night and day. 
Check in was ok, we were greeting with a smile by an Asian lady. We paid up front my maestro and she took an extra 50 Euros for a deposit as if we were going to steal the bed. Been a SPG Gold Member is received my free gift which I choose free internet. 

The deluxe room was nice with a nice view over looking Dublin; we were on the 4th floor. Even though the room and bathroom was nice, what I found extremely disgusting was the fact that they had an extra duvet on the bed as blanket not covered by any sheets which I guess they don‚Äôt wash often and the fact that the main duvet didn‚Äôt even have a duvet cover over it but two upper sheets and there you kept touching this duvet non stop. For me, in future if I would walk into a room and this was like this again, it would make be check out on the stop. 

In the morning, I found the shower pressure very soft and the service in the dining room for breakfast really bad. I had to get up and walk over to an area behind a curtain where all the service people including the manager were speaking between themselves rather than looking for guests, I think I made 3 trips just to get some attention. 

On check out, we didn‚Äôt use anything in room or any room service but getting our deposit back was very difficult, they didn‚Äôt have the pin code to the machine and would not give us cash, therefore we were very much delayed and missed out train.  Then they tried to bill me for the free gift I received apart of the SPG gold members program: free Internet. Then that led to more discussions. 

In my view having stayed at this hotel many times in the past, service is getting very lazy and I wouldn‚Äôt really call this hotel a 5 star hotel. More so a 4 star especially with the service and rooms.",3,2012,03,22
202,OK,Very nice location. The staff was incredibly nice and helpful the room was ok and the bathrooms were very nice. They even have a speaker in the bathrooms for the TV. The only problem was that the Wi-Fi was temperamental the whole time. I would recommend to someone who wanted to get away from everything but not to one who needs to be connected.,3,2012,03,18
202,Fabulous Westin Staff,"Best staff of any Hotel we have been to whether in the USA or abroad! Michael, the concierge , , first greeted us with a friendly smile and his knowledge and guidance made our time in Dublin the best yet! Michael made reservations to see live Irish song and dance it was awesome. Right in front of the stage. He also gave us a complete history of Dublin things we never knew. We have been to Ireland several times but never have we had such attention to our every comfort. All hotels would be wise to follow this model. Concierge's are a must in a Hotel. We will definitely go back to stay here. Room fabulous,clean,had a view of the city, quiet, unforgettable. The entire staff always had a warm smile on their face. AAAA+++++++++",5,2012,03,17
202,Amazing location,"We were given a balcony room on the 5th floor with a view of trinity college (I assume this was an upgrade because we booked a standard double!). The room was bright and clean. The staff were extremely helpful and looked after our bags until our room was ready when we checked in. 
I cannot say a bad word about our experience and would definitely stay again.",5,2012,03,17
202,Great hotel staff and concierge,The entire staff at the Westin Dublin -- including the Exchange Restaurant and Atrium Bar -- was excellent.  See Michael the concierge for great tips on dinner and sightseeing.  He knows the city well and made dinner reservations for us at a place that had a terrific live irish music show.,5,2012,03,16
202,Irish Hospitality,"We stayed here 2 years ago for the rugby weekend and were so well received that we returned for this year's match.  Unfortunately, despite being 3 hours after advertised check in, we were told our room wasn't ready and we'd have to wait - suggested an upgrade and watched while receptionist told this to another then got called across to be given a key - disappointing!

What made our trip was the concierge Michael Byrne - he was the one to make us welcome/laugh not only then but throughout our weekend - he is a great asset to the hotel in guest relations.  Also Karl, the Manager and his team in the Mint Bar also helped to restore our faith in irish friendliness.

As for the heavenly beds, the bed was comfy but the pillows.... but on a positive note, luxury is having a ""top"" sheet.

Shame about the result of the match but on the whole we'd probably go back as very central - would look for feedback cards for reception (asked but told just in their ""outlets""!).",4,2012,03,13
202,Perfect choice,"We stayed here March 3-5 and the hotel lived up to its ""tripadvisor"" reputation. It has an ideal location (next to the Temple Bar Area) and, we found the hotel personnel to be extremely friendly and helpful.  Michael, the concierge, gave us all sorts of assistance by directing us to different Dublin attractions and helping us build our itinerary.",5,2012,03,10
202,"Good business hotel with a ""boutique"" feel","Although the hotel is in fact in a modern building, the feel inside is like staying in one of the gorgeous Georgian townhouses for which Dublin is so famous. There is no ""chain hotel"" feel at all. The service both at the front desk and in the F&B outlets was consistently of a very high standard and the one meal I had in house was excellent. I am a Starwood Platinum and would normally get upgraded to the best room in the house, but as they were genuinely sold out I only got a deluxe (read ""standard""). To my surprise, the room was spacious and extremely comfortable - if I didn't know otherwise, I would have thought I had been upgraded. If I had one complaint it is that the music in the basement pub was a little too loud for a business conversation, but there are two other options - the Atrium Lounge and the bar attached to the main restaurant, so I am really nit-picking here. All-in-all an excellent experience. I would absolutely stay there again.",5,2012,03,02
202,Perfection,"We had our wedding in the hotel last summer, in which we stayed in the Presidental Suite for 2 nights. Everything about the hotel is perfect, from the location to the attention to detail from each and every member of staff. A special word of thanks should go to Bridgitte Condon who ensured our day was amazing. She made sure every single little detail was covered, therefore ensuring we had a stress free day. The ballroom is amazing.
The Presidental suite is just out of this world, what a room to spend our first night as a married couple. We cant wait to go back to the hotel for our 1 year anniversary.",5,2012,02,29
202,Didn't live up to expectations ....,"I've given it a 3 rather than a 4 because I had high expecatations of the Westin based on previous reviews and reputation.  It is generally a nice hotel in a GREAT location.  The public areas of the hotel are very impressive.  Staff were extremely helpful (my room was not ready when I checked in - fair enough, it was still quite early - but they took my number and called as soon as it was).  The beds were certainly comfortable, not sure they live up to the hype though!

I didn't eat there so can't comment on the food.

The disappointing aspects - the room was quite small, especially as I had paid to upgrade to a 'deluxe twin'  the beds were only about a foot apart.  The bathroom was quite grubby - particularly the grouting around the tiles which was grey and discoloured.  The TV didn't work (couldn't be bothered to report it until checking out though as we were going out for the night and didn't want the hassle).  The coffee machines have a US style plug - I had to call reception to find out where the adaptor was hidden - bit faffy.  No free water in the room and no vanity kit.  Ok fairly minor points but generally pretty standard at a 5*.

Would I go back?  Probably yes, especially if I got a good price.  But next time I would modify my expectations a bit!",3,2012,02,28
202,Not impressed,"I stayed here this past week, for one night to attend a breakfast meeting the next morning. I had been traveling throughout Ireland, and had some other hotel experiences to compare my stay at the Westin to. I found this experience to be far short of any of my other hotel stays in Ireland - including at small b&bs. There were some plus points, but in general, you can do a WHOLE lot better in Dublin (Radisson Blu and Fitzwilliam to name but a few) than the Westin.

From the beginning, my experience was not pleasant. I checked in (having booked weeks in advance and having requested on booking and via email a Queen bed) and found I had been given two singles. When I stated that I had requested a Queen bed, was told that they were sold out - I could, of course, upgrade (for a very dear sum) to a Suite ... or they would give me a deluxe room - but it would still have two singles. I was not happy, and said so. I was then shuffled around and given what seemed like the smallest tiniest room in the hotel, with a tiny window overlooking some office blocks. The room smelled musty and unused - but it had a Queen bed! The ironing board was broken. Room service was OK but the food I ordered did not match the description in the menu. Bed was comfortable. 

Upon check in, I had told the front desk that my business partner would bring my car to the hotel the next morning at around 730, in order to meet me for our business breakfast. When she arrived, they flat out refused to take the car, telling her that no one had informed them and they were full. This caused her great inconvenience. Once she finally made it into the hotel, they sent her to the wrong place for the meeting. 

I also informed the front desk that I would check out 1 hour late (1pm instead of 12pm). I was told that I had to check out ""not a minute later than 1pm"" or else incur extra charges (thats fine, but the way in which I was told made me feel like a beggar). When I returned to my room at 1230, I had been locked out. I had to walk through the warren of the hotel to get to the front desk where many people were trying to check out, in order to try and get my card to work again. It took me more than 20 minutes to get into my room!

Upon checkout, I was not asked if I enjoyed my stay (as is the usual for any hotel). Instead, I told the checkout receptionist that I had been disappointed in my time at the Westin. She looked at me, shrugged and said, thats too bad. She never asked me what the issues were, and seemed uninterested in my negative experience. I never received a receipt for my stay until I specifically asked for it. 

Plus points of the stay: Its central, though other hotels will give you that for a better price and better experience. Comfortable bed. They went out of their way to help me store some cold items. And finally, just as we were leaving, we met Pat (I think his name is) ... the tall doorman at the Westin. He was FABULOUS. Welcoming, open, funny, interested, kind and thoughtful. He personified what the Westin SHOULD be ... and is the ONLY reason its even getting 3 stars - otherwise, it would be 1 or 2.",3,2012,02,26
202,a calm oasis in the middle of Dublin city...,"this is my favourite place in Dublin, from staying ,to simply having coffee in th beautifully designed  atrium. staff are courteous and obliging.value was excellent, free newspaper and biscuits with tea or coffee for 6 euro. Cant fault it on anything except no pool.",5,2012,02,24
202,Outstanding Staff... Amazing Stay,"I spent two weeks at the Westin Dublin on a business trip and was extremely impressed with pretty much every aspect of the stay.  First off, the staff is simply incredible.  They pay extra special attention to every detail.  When asking for recommendations for places to eat, they were spot on with every ask.  Umbrellas were provided without having to ask for them on a rainy day and the concierge even offered his coat to me as a cold spell whipped through one morning and I had forgotten a coat.  Most importantly, the staff was sincere.  They truly wanted you to have a memorable stay.

The location of the Westin is fantastic.  Directly across the street is the start of the Temple Bar area. Quite touristy, but fun nightlife.  A must visit if it is your first time to Dublin.  Also important was the Starbucks two buildings down.  Great way to start the day.

The rooms were nice.  I was upgraded to one of the Westin workout rooms.  I found the room to be bigger than expected for Europe.  There is a separate shower and tub and nice attention to detail.  The rooms themselves will not blow you away, but the beds are great.  Wake up calls were very prompt and I slept well the entire trip.

The Mint Bar was great.  Nice menu, live music on some nights and a good crowd.  A little disappointed that it was dead on SuperBowl Sunday (also when there was an Ireland/Wales Rugby match), but everyone was at the local pubs. Again, staff was great.  Service was a bit slow, but I think this is just kind of ""the way"" here.  

All in all, a great trip.  The Westin is reasonably priced and I would certainly stay again. Kudos to the staff.  The best I've seen in awhile and I spend 120 nights/year in hotels.",5,2012,02,23
202,Falls Short of Westin Brand,"Having stayed at Westin hotels around the world, this one falls well short of the brand.  My stay wasn't terrible, but more like a mid-tiered hotel.
PROS: Centrally located.  Nice rooms.
CONS: 1) Lacks attention to detail, which is what makes a great hotel great; and 2) no club lounge

I try to avoid being petty on TA, but when you add up all of these things, it was disappointing, considering it's the Westin brand:
1. Waited 10 minutes to check in even though only one person in front of me (they had only one person running the reception desk at 10 am in the morning)
2. No Club Lounge or special amenities for Starwood Preferred guests (even Aloft and FourPoints do a better job of making me feel like a loyal SPG member)
3. No CNBC on TV (called their tech desk and was told as they migrate to new system, the channel is unavailable)
4. Dialed room service and the ""Service Express"" operator tried to take my order but she was clearly untrained in the process.  After muddling through the order, she had to call me back 10 minutes after placing my order to tell me they didn't carry an item I ordered (and then the food took 45 minutes to get to my room)
5. No bottled water in the room, which is standard at every SPG property I've stayed at over the past year.

I would look past any 1 or 2 of the items above, but all of them added up gives this Westin only a 3-rating from me.  If this was a Holiday Inn Express or Marriott Courtyard, I'd look past these shortcomings, but it's a city-center Westin.",3,2012,02,22
202,Great Location,"I spent three nights here on a long weekend trip with some friends. You can't go wrong with the location - it is across the street from the Grafton Street and the Temple Bar area with its bountiful selection of pubs and restaurants. It is close to the DART station (about a 10 minute walk) which you go to take the train out to the coastal suburbs. If you're here for a short time, this is perfect because it gives you access to just about everything you need to take in the sights. The staff and service at the Westin were also wonderful. Have tea in the atrium, it's quite delightful. You can get on the Airlink bus to/from the airport across the street or you can take a cab which is about 20 euro and just a short ride from the airport.",5,2012,02,21
202,"Not bad, but could do better.","Me and some friends stayed at the Westin Dublin Hotel february 2012. When checking in we were asked if we wanted a bigger room for 30 euros a night. We accepted the offer and got to our room. Spacious room, very comfortable beds and a big bathroom. The view was not what I was expecting, straight into a brick wall and another rooms window. Not more than 4 meters to the other rooms windows.
We decided to take a quick shower and then go out and eat something before dinner. There was a stop in the drain so all the water leaked out on the bathroom floor. Suddenly it started to drip water from a spotlight in the ceiling down into the sink. We called the reception and they told us that they would send someone to fix it right away. We got back to the hotel two hours later and the drain was still not fixed but the dripping had stopped from the ceiling. We called the reception once again and they promised us once more to fix it. We went out for dinner and when we got back at night the stop in the drain was fixed and they couldn't find a leak in the ceiling.
After some trouble getting to sleep at approximately 2 am some drunk person in the bar in the basement pressed the fire alarm button. Through speakers we were told to evacuate the hotel. We ran down the stairs. In the reception we were told it was a false alarm. It's not the easiest thing, to calm down at 2 am after running the stairs. At 3.30 am i finally got back so sleep.

Then the safety box started to fail on us. We were on our way out and the rest of our company waited for us down in the lobby. The safety box then decided not to open. It just said call securi1. So we called the reception and they told us that they would send someone to our room immediately. After 20 minutes a security guy came to our room and opened our box. We locked it and ran downstairs were the rest of our company had been waiting for us in 25 minutes.
Same thing happened three times more. The last two times I was not very polite and it only took 5-10 minutes for the security guy to come to our room. But still, it's not something that you want. Have to call the reception every time you want to get into your safety box.
The last time the security girl who tried to open the box failed so she had to ring for some extra help. I was so angry!
When do need to get in to the safety box? Yes, just before you leave the room. So every time our box failed on us we had to wait for the security guy to come to our room and open it. While he was opening the box the rest of our company were waiting for us down in the lobby.

When checking out I told them that I was not paying 30 euros extra per night which they accepted. I still think they got away quite easy comparing all the problems we had at our stay.

If our room worked properly, it would have been a great stay at a great hotel.",4,2012,02,21
202,Best Concierge Ever -- ask Daragh,"The concierge staff was spot on with every recommendation and extremely helpful.  Daragh was our primary source for info and reservations. He did spectacularly well steering us to the best events and best use of time and money!  The rest of the experience was 4-stars.  As a platinum member, I usually get a much nicer room and they were still being advertised as available during check-in.  The food is pricey and not worth the extra fee considering better restaurants are literally across the street for much less.  Everyone was terrificly friendly so I really have no other complaints other than it was just not 5-stars in my experience.",4,2012,02,20
202,City Break in Ireland's Fair City,"This was a surprise weekend break for my birthday.  So going to Dublin was brilliant and topped off by staying in this fabulous city centre hotel.  The reception staff were friendly and helpful, swift checkin and we were shown to our room.  We were on the 4th floor with a stunning view across Dublin's old roof tops and chimney pots, looking down Pearse Street with Trinity College to the right of our window.  A beautifully laid out room with an extremely comfortable bed.  The Bathroom was fitted with a generous sized shower and separate bath tub.   White fluffy towels and very nice amenities. 
The location is perfect too.  Just minutes form both the major shopping districts North and South of the Liffey.  It was also within walking distance of the great Dublin night life.I couldn't recommend this hotel more. The Westin Dublin lives up to the Brand's high standards in luxury hotels.",5,2012,02,20
202,A one night treat,"Being from Dublin my wife and I decided to treat ourselves to an overnight stay in a 5* Hotel as we were booked into Chapter One Restaurant for an evening meal and decided to make a day/night of it. Peter, the doorman, looked after our car and luggage and we were in our room within minutes which was great to have extra time to get out into the city and explore. Our room was adequate if a bit small. It was an 'internal' room so we had no road noise by ambulance/police vehicles. Our room looked into a beautiful Atrium housing a cafe/restaurant. We returned from our meal and headed into the Mint bar to try out a cocktail or two which didn't disappoint. It was extremely busy and lively with a band playing and the staff although few were serving people with no delay but had no time to chat to guests. There was a great buzz about the place and we headed up at 2am very merry. Next morning after a wonderful nights sleep we checked out and within minutes of doing so my car was brought around and parked outside for our short trip home. Overall we were delighted to of chosen the Westin over other hotels in the area like The Shelbourne or The Wesbury and would return without hesitation.",4,2012,02,20
202,Stunning well equipped hotel in the heart of the city,"The Westin is the second hotel from the Starwood group that I have stayed in (the other being the Sheraton in Sydney). It doesn't disappoint! 

Welcomed at the door, we had a completely hassle free check-in, and a choice of room - either a view of Trinity College, or a more spacious room. we opted for the spacious room - and still had a nice view.

we ate lunch in the bar in the basement - delicious food, friendly service, and nice atmosphere.

The beds were a tiny bit firm for my liking, but I still had a great nights sleep - very quiet, and a great powerful shower in the morning.

The location is perfect - right beside Trinity College, and across from the Temple Bar area. I can't imagine a better location for a weekend exploration of Dublin.",5,2012,02,20
202,Great Stay in Dublin City Center,"Just got back from a quick business trip in Dublin and had a great time.  The Westin Dublin is in the heart of it all, steps away from shopping, restaurants, guided tours, Trinity College, Temple Bar, etc.

The hotel was recently updated, and while my bed wasn't exactly a 'queen' (it was smaller), it was just fine for a business trip.  Not ideal for 2 guests though.

The room was clean, modern and nicely decorated.  For all practical purposes, it was huge.  The bathroom was fantastic with both a walk in shower and a fantastic bathtub.

The staff was great, from providing helpful quick tourist trips to pubs and restaurants to check out during my stay.

Michael, the Concierge, was especially helpful in getting me to a great dinner and night out in Temple Bar.

Great place to stay for sure.

",4,2012,02,19
202,Fantastic Place To Stay,"Upon arrival at the lovely Westin Hotel in Dublin, you will be greeted by Peter, the doorman.  This wonderful man was there everyday with a most genuine smile and a wish for a great day.  Not to mention the fact that he is very, very knowledgable about the area.  The entire hotel staff was amazing from start to finish.  Every effort was made to take care of any needs that came up. Front desk staff was just great-every one of them. The rooms are clean and comfortable, beds are kind of small in comparison to the US hotels, however, my husband and I are on the taller side, so....  But, that said, we found that Hotels in Ireland generally have smaller beds.  I do want to mention that the beds do have the signature SPG comfy, fluffy bedding.  Very nice.  The Westin in centrally located in the city and is within walking distance to most everything.  You can walk next door to Trinity College to see the Book of Kells, then go to the corner and get on the Hop on Hop Off Bus to tour the rest of the city.  I will mention that this time of year it was cold.  We all had layers of clothing to keep warm, but a winter coat would be appropriate here.  There is a lovely atrium in the hotel that is just picture perfect for a cup of afternoon tea and sweets.  You can also get bar selections here as well.  Really very nice.  The Mint Bar in the lower region of the hotel was the perfect place for all of our extended family members to gather.  Although we took up about a third of the bar, the place was packed on Friday night with dancing and fun.  I was impressed how the bartenders, as busy as they were, still looked out for the tourists and their belongings.  I was told a couple of times to watch my bag or someone else's bag as there were locals getting too close.  I was made to feel very safe by the staff.  I also want to mention that you can get some nice sandwiches at the Mint Bar.  I highly recommend this hotel as your choice in Dublin.  You will not be dissapointed!!",5,2012,02,19
202,Outstanding..,"I stay in many hotels throughout the world and this one, being true to the culture in Ireland has a warm & friendly reception, with a helpful dedicated team and prices that are very reasonable.  The food was delicious, and I ate in the Mint bar and the hotel restaurant. There are many very good hotels in Dublin and this amongst the best.",5,2012,02,18
202,"Elegance, Comfort and Service in the Heart of Dublin","We stayed here using our SPG reward points.  We did not pay a dime for this stay but felt we got a great value for the number of points we redeemed.  This is without a doubt a 5 star hotel.  Every staff member we encountered (check-in, concierge, door man and wait staff) was friendly, courteous and helpful.  The rooms are plush, clean, elegant and well-appointed.  We especially liked the signature Westin heavenly bed and the large marble bathroom with a separate shower and tub.  The room was stocked with a hair dryer, 2 robes, an iron, a flat-screen t.v., complementary bottled water and Westin's signature shampoo/soap/conditioner/lotion.  Internet is available in the room for a fee though there is a complementary business center with computers and printers.  

The location is probably the best in Dublin.  The hotel is surrounded by Trinity College, Temple Bar, O'Connell Street and Grafton Street.  Most tourist attractions are within a ten minute walk.  We were there only one night after staying a week in the town of Adare.  Due to the short duration of our stay, the location was a huge plus!  Returning to the airport was easy the next morning.  It is a 25 EURO, 20 minute cab ride to the airport or there are several bus/shuttle options.  Because we had a party of 4, the cab ended up costing about the same as the shuttle and it was much faster.",5,2012,02,16
202,"Great Hotel, Great Location","Had a couple of nights in Dublin on business last week and was lucky enough to be staying at the Westin.  Located slap bang in the centre of town it was a great location, just a short stroll to the bars and restaurants.  

My room appeared to be very recently renovated, with two double beds, and spacious room and very large bathroom.  The view was into an atrium and despite only being on the second floor there was no noise.  In fact if i were to return I would ask for the same room.  City Centre hotels can be very noisy for us country bumpkins but this was ideal.

The staff were excellent, from the receptionists to the very chatty porter who delivered my luggage.  Breakfast came in the shape of a small, yet perfectly formed buffet, with a wide range above and beyond the usual.  The Mint Bar had a great atmosphere and I even grabbed a meal in there one evening rather doing my usual of heading out to a local restaurant.

A great choice if you are ever in Dublin.",5,2012,02,14
202,Super Central Location,"What can I say that hasn't been said! I grew up in Ireland and fly back a few times a year - this past visit I decided to celebrate a friend's birthday with a night out in Dublin and booked the Westin. It was wonderful - staff are so friendly and helpful (why are hotel staff usually so snooty?), check in and out was fast and efficient, our room overlooked the street so we could people watch, but it must have a been triple paned window because there was no noise filtering up to us. Our room was in immaculate condition and spotlessly clean - loved the double doors into the bathroom...and the big bath...and the fluffy robe. I'm trying to plan my next visit around another birthday so I have an excuse to return to the Westin again.",5,2012,02,14
202,Excellent Hospitality.,"I stayed at the Westin Dublin for 9 nights this February. The facility is in a perfect location. You are able to walk almost everywhere and if a taxi is needed it is only a short ride. The bus system is also directly across the street. While the facility was great, the staff was even more impressive. I have stayed in many Westin's and this was the best so far. Every staff member from the house staff, restaurant service, bar staff and most impressive the concierge staff were there to meet your every need. I cannot say enough about their professionalism , friendliness and efficiency. This was by far the best hotel stay.",5,2012,02,14
202,Perfect Location ‚Äì Bring Your Walking Shoes! ‚Äì Friendly & Responsive Staff,"As I first time visitor to Dublin I would agree with all the positive reviews of the Westin Dublin. The location is perfect ‚Äì directly across the street from Trinity (make sure you see the Book of Kells!), or cross the street and walk up Fleet street for numerous bars & restaurants. We found the Palace Bar to be a wonderful place to sample an array of Irish whiskeys.  Grafton street is a short walk ‚Äì it is much more ‚Äòtouristy‚Äô, but still a pleasant place to walk. I was in Dublin for a conference at the Convention Centre which gave me the opportunity for a daily morning and late afternoon walk along the river to and from the Centre.
The hotel itself is great ‚Äì we upgraded to a Deluxe room which gave us a view of Westmoreland street. The room was very quiet, we were able to have a street view without any disturbing street noise.  Special shout out to Michael (concierge) ‚Äì he was very knowledge and helpful with activity planning and advice, as well as practical information (we needed to purchase inexpensive Pay-as-You-Go GSM phone).

My overall impression of Dublin is that is much less ‚ÄòDisney-fied‚Äô than many tourist destinations. While tourism is obviously an important part of the local economy, as I visitor I felt more that I was welcomed into an existing community, rather than dropped into an ‚Äòexperience‚Äô created for tourists.

Tip: Please be advised that Dublin is not a 24x7 city. It can be difficult to find a restaurant that serves after 9 pm during the week and most convenience stores close by midnight (?) and do not re-open until 7 am.",5,2012,02,09
202,Great base of operations for Dublin trip,"I stayed in the Westin Dublin for 8 days this past February, and had a very grand time.  I checked in at 3PM on a Saturday and per some TripAdvisor traveler tips, I made sure to request a room overlooking Trinity College so that I could avoid noise from the Atrium.  Luckily the staff was able to accommodate my request. This put my room in a nice location on the third floor, with a nice view, and I didn't have any problem with noise during my stay. That said, the hotel seems less busy in February, so things may be noisier in the summer months.

I didn't spend too much time in my room, but it suited my needs. The bedroom area is small and a little worn in places, but I found the closet space to be ample.  By contrast, the bathroom is huge, modern and bright--and I really appreciated being able to take a long bath after walking around in the cold Dublin rain.  The room included amenities such as a coffee maker, hot water maker, phones, hair dryer, iron/ironing board, flatscreen tv, alarm clock, bathrobe, thermostat, bathtub/shower, makeup mirror and safe (which was large enough to fit my 15"" laptop).   Most importantly it had the standard Westin heavenly bed...I thank that thing for helping me get over jet lag!

The service was great; housekeeping was prompt and the concierge answered all of my questions.  They helped me get cabs that took credit cards, and even loaned me a US > UK adapter for the outlets.  The breakfast service, although sometimes understaffed, was prompt once seated and I really loved the breakfast buffet!

Overall, here's my breakdown:

PROS
- Westin Heavenly Bed
- Prompt housekeeping and concierge
- Well located property--right next to Trinity College, Temple Bar and very walkable to most tour bus pickups
- Clean, large, well-lit bathroom with bathtub (the hotel is near a Lush store if you need to stock up!)
- Flatscreen TV and coffee/tea maker
- Bathrobe
- Quiet rooms
- Safe fits laptop
- Blackout curtains
- Windows open (some rooms)
- Breakfast buffet is very nice.  Get it included in your room rate if you can.
- Gym was cleaned and restocked often

CONS
- The gym was a little small, and quickly gets crowded.  No windows.
- Cost for internet per night is very high at 15 EURO.  Try to purchase the 4-night deal (4 for 40 EURO) to decrease this a bit.
- Although there are signs that indicate a Gift Shop is on site, it doesn't exist.  

TIPS  
- You can earn a 5 EURO voucher for every day that you decline housekeeping.  A good way to earn a drink or two in the Atrium!
- With the exception of a 24 hour 7 Eleven-type store down the street, nothing seems to be open before 7AM in Dublin.  This is important if you are looking for breakfast before an early tour.",4,2012,02,09
202,The warmth of Dublin (and I don't mean the weather!),"Fantastic hotel, centrally located with lovely rooms and elegant public rooms. Service is impeccable and the staff could not be more helpful. Only ate breakfast and lunch in the hotel but the food was delicious and the Atrium Bar is a relaxing place to eat.
All the staff on reception were extremely efficient and and Michael ( Concierge ) was particularly attentive - giving us lots of tips on how best to utilise our time in Dublin. We particularly enjoyed our visit to the Guinness Storehouse - use the hop on - hop off tourist bus to see the sights.  In the evening Temple Bar is very lively and the live music and Irish dancing in Gogarty's is a treat.The people of Dublin are what makes a trip here so special  - they are kind and welcoming and made our visit truly memorable.",5,2012,02,08
202,Outstanding for business or pleasure,"Stayed here a few days for business recently and it was outstanding all around.  Have stayed at the Conrad Dublin down the street (also very good) but found the Westin to be slightly more elegant and the location very good.  Staff was very helpful.  Rooms very comfortable.  Nice bar in the cellar (although you are in Dublin and need to take in the town, right?).  We walked to any number of outstanding restaurants and bars near the hotel.  Room service fine.  Etc.   Would highly recommend for both business and pleasure.",4,2012,02,07
202,Dublin for a Long Weekend,"Finding great airfare and the Westin in the center of Dublin made for a great long weekend.  The hotel was elegant and had a great central location.  Across the street was the famous Temple Bar area.  All the attractions (Jameson Factory, Guinness Factory, The Jail, The Dublin Castle, Trinity College and much more) were all easily accessible from a walk through the streets or using the great local transportation.  The hotel was convenient and hospitable.  I would recommend this location.",4,2012,02,06
202,"Wow, wow, wow (did I mention WOW!?)","Fabulous location. Luxurious rooms. Great meals. Reasonable prices. Perfect location for easy access to all of the sites. But what truly sets apart this hotel is its outstanding staff. Recently I stayed 6 nights and couldn't believe the service - on reception, Inaki greeted me by name each day; Laszlo (concierge) arranged taxis and wake-up calls; Daragh (concierge) made sure that I always got the best rate on my excursions; and Michael (concierge) spent a few minutes determining what my interests were so that he could recommend tourist stops that were best suited to me. Who needs a travel agent to plan a holiday when you have the staff at this Westin hotel? I will certainly go back and highly recommend it to anyone travelling in the area.",5,2012,02,05
202,Most comfortable bed ever!,"I stayed at the Westin Dublin for a business trip to Ireland.  This hotel is located in the most central location in Dublin.  I cannot think of anywhere that I went where I could not walk.  The service in the hotel was good.  The bed in the room was unbelievable.  It might be the most comfortable bed that I have ever slept in - it was that good.  Overall, I had a very good stay at the Westin.  Would recommend it to anyone visiting Dublin for business or pleasure.",5,2012,02,05
202,Great location and service,"Perfect location to know this amazing city. Room was spacious and comfortable. As in most Westin hotels, the bed was simply perfect. Breakfast should probably be improved: more and better products should be offered. Check-in process was a bit slow but they kindly accepted a late check-out at 3pm with no extra cost.",4,2012,02,04
202,Superb hotel in excellent location,"I stayed just one night in the Westin Dublin having booked it as a treat for my partner's 50th birthday. When making the reservation i indicated that, as it was his 50th birthday I would be in contact with the hotel to arrange a surprise for him. Pressure of work prevented me doing so but on arrival in the room my partner was delighted to find that there was a slice of cheesecake on a plate with happy 50th birthday written in chocolate!  Needless to say i was delighted & surprised by this also. The hotel is stunning in a very central location. Our classic room was lovely & the enormous bed incredibly comfortable. There was a separate shower & bath & the shower was excellent. If i have any quibbles at all the are, firstly, I hate when top class hotels, which already charge high prices, insist on charging for wi-fi. Secondly why not include breakfast in the room charge. We'd have loved breakfast i bed but couldn't justify the ‚Ç¨21.95 charge. However we thoroughly enjoyed our very brief stay at Westin Dublin",4,2012,02,04
202,Beautiful hotel centrally located,"My husband and I stayed here with our 22 month old daughter.  The hotel itself is very pretty.  The staff at the front desk could not have been more helpful.  They had made a mistake and put a bed in our room for our daughter instead of a crib and the effort and quickness to remedy the mistake was amazing.  They also noticed a chip in our rental car and fixed it for us.The hotel is perfectly located for temple bar, henry street and grafton street walking.  We actually walked all over Dublin using this as our base. The staff at the Mint Bar were also very nice and let our daughter walk around like she owned the place (with us following of course).   The Atrium bar was very nice but a little too stuffy for our family and I don't think the presence of a toddler would go over well but we never tried. I gave it only 4 stars because unlike the usual amazing Westin beds, our bed was so uncomfortable.  The room itself was quite large and clean. The linens were stiff and the bed itself was just not comfy. But overall it was a lovely stay.",4,2012,02,02
202,Well placed and good service,"A 5 star hotel and you pay for it, but friendly, attentive staff who remembered us from one day to the next.  We were given a beautiful room on the 5th floor with views over Trinity College.  Large, well appointed room with a very big bathroom, in fact probably the biggest I've had in any 5 star hotel.

The hotel is perfectly situated for Grafton Street shopping, Temple Bar eating and drinking and jumping on the tour buses.

Not 5 stars due to issues with the room.  There was NO water from the hot tap in the bath and none of the plug sockets worked.  The plug sockets were fixed quickly but we were told that the bath could not be fixed.  For a 5 star hotel this is very poor and I would have scored lower if it was not for the excellent staff response.

We were immediately offered a new room or compensation.  As we were all unpacked we chose the latter which came in the form of all-inclusive breakfasts in our room with glasses of champagne.

I always think that a hotel stands and falls on its service and this was handled very well indeed and certainly deserves the rating of 4/5.",4,2012,02,01
202,very central for all the attractions,"visited here using my starwood points, very central for all the attractions.  Rooms to the high standard you would expect from at Starwood Hotel.  Good entertainment in the bar several times a week.  Parked our car at the hotel  which was 24 euros a night but worth it, because parking is a nightmare.",4,2012,01,30
202,Excellent!!!! close of everything,Is in the center of the historical sites. Is very clean and confortable.,5,2012,01,29
202,Wonderful weekend in the Westin,"We have just stayed in this hotel and were absolutely delighted with everything! Our previous experience of a 5star hotel was the Shelbourne and we were so disappointed with that,we really didn't know what to expect.The difference between the 2 hotels was amazing and we couldn't fault the Westin at all.We ate in the Exchange Restaurant on Saturday and the meal for 8 people was both delicious and reasonably priced-especially for Dublin!! Our room was spacious,comfortable,and spotless-we were very impressed with the large bathroom.The highest praise,however,is reserved for all the Staff(hello,Kerryman Michael!)who were attentive,friendly and courteous-a credit to themselves and their Employer.We're really looking forward to our next stay.",5,2012,01,29
202,One of my favorite hotels,"The Westin hotel chain is one of my favorite and this is hotel is on my short list of favorite hotels.
Great location (across from 'Temple Bar'), small but comfortable rooms, wonderful staff, nice restaurant (I enjoy the breakfast there the most), Atrium lounge and bar (super place to relax and enjoy tea of coffee), basement bar / night club, cozy lobby with two fireplaces to hold back the cold during winter.
It is expensive $$$$",5,2012,01,22
202,"Excellent stay, great staff!","We just returned from a week at the Westin in Dublin, and we couldn't be happier! The room was spacious and clean, and the bathroom was so much more than we expected, with a tub, shower, and lots of room! The hotel was very quiet at night, which was a huge bonus! The building is very beautiful, and has its own bars and restaurant. We ate at The Exchange (their restaurant) for breakfast one morning, and the food was delicious, and we had drinks in the atrium, where the bartender went above and beyond to serve us!

The staff were exceptional! We arrived at about 5:30am, knowing that check-in wasn't until 3pm, but they took our luggage for us, and looked to see if they had a room available. They didn't, but told us to check back a little later, and we did end up being able to go to our room a couple of hours early (thank you!). They gave us a map of the city, and some advice on where to go. Throughout the duration of the trip, the entire staff was wonderful, always saying hello and seeing if there was anything they could do for us. A big thanks to Michael up front, who helped direct us to the Brazen Head and gave us some advice about getting around. He was extremely nice! At check-out, the employees were terrific as well!

They also do a lot to conserve, which I really appreciated. You get vouchers for 5 Euros or 500 Starpoints for days when you decline housekeeping services in an effort to conserve, and all the water bottles we received were glass. Also, I don't know if it was because we were ""Starfriends"", but we received complementary water and fruit!

Overall, this is a great place to stay! From the super friendly staff, to the beautiful building and many amenities, we would definitely stay here again!",5,2012,01,22
202,Super Luxury,"We've only spent one night of a two night stay here and I already felt compelled to write a review!
This hotel is the highlight of our visit to Ireland and we are so happy we decided to treat ourselves to the Westin. The welcome & service so far have been truly exceptional. 
I know Westin is an international brand but the welcome is as Irish as any other hotel we stayed in.
Our room is just beautiful & is luxury iteslf! I would highly recommend thsi hotel",5,2012,01,19
202,"Excellent accommodations, fantastic staff","Very pleased with the hotel accommodations, but the friendliness and helpfulness of the staff really made this stay special. From the bartender downstairs who gave me advice on Irish whiskey to the hostess at breakfast who packaged a bagel and coffee for me to take on a walk, to the housekeeping staff who never failed to greet me as I passed in the hall (you won't get that in the U.S.!) everyone has just been wonderful. Extra kudos to Michael in the front, who gave me a variety or choices on restaurants when I was in the mood for fish and chips. Then he flagged me a taxi, gave the driver directions and sent me on to an excellent meal.  The following night, he recognized me as I walked past, interrupted what he was working on, and came from behind the desk to make sure I had enjoyed my outing. All this, with a genuine smile and sense of humor, not a hand out, and a sincere interest in helping me enjoy my stay in Ireland. My entire stay here has been greatly improved by that level of service.

There is another hotel a little closer to our offices in Dublin, but next time I'm here, I'm coming back to the Westin.",5,2012,01,17
202,"Very nice Hotel, central location, friendly staff","We stayed at the hotel and were treated very well by the staff. My only reservation would be,,, do not book with lastminute.com as we did. The room you think you are getting is not guaranteed. It is only guaranteed you will get something like it. I did not understand this but was treated very well by the staff as we worked to find a solution.
Nothing is ever perfect but the staff at this hotel did everything they could to make my time in Dublin special.",5,2012,01,16
202,"Best beds, top location and great room","I was in Dublin for a play at the gate so the westin was handy. I was able to check in early as I had arrived early to do some shopping. Lady at check in was very helpful and I was given my room key within minutes. She even upgraded me to a deluxe room. 
I had booked my room on lastminute.com as a top secret hotel and had got an extremely good rate. 
The room was spacious and had large bathroom with seperate bath and shower. I had a lovely view of trinity college. I was a bit concerned that as i was on first floor the traffic noise might be too much but once I closed window there was very little noise. 
The best bit by far was the bed and black out curtains. Had a fantastic sleep. 
I did not eat in hotel but had a few drinks in atrium bar. I didn't get the chance to go down to the mint bar but have previously had cocktails there and they are top notch. 
The hotel is in a great location beside trinity so grafton street is only a minute away. Will definitely consider it for my next Dublin trip. ",5,2012,01,15
202,Fun in Dublin!,"The Westin truly speaks for itself. As two college backpacker students traveling on a mother's Credit card points, we were treated like ROYALTY. Wonderful experience. Very clean. Doorman, Peter really made our experience. He was very sweet and helped us get around the city. Also arranged for the Wild Wicklow Tour (An AMAZING tour of the Wicklow mountains) to pick us up at the front of the hotel on the morning of our trip :)

Would most definitely visit again.

Internet was costly. The only downfall.",5,2012,01,13
202,"Fine hotel, excellent location in city center","Located on the College Green square in the center of Dublin, the Westin Dublin is a fine place for a tourist.  It is walking distance from all the historic sites (Book of Kells, Dublin Castle, National Museum, National Gallery, Christ Church, St Patrick's Cathedral, Old Jameson Distillery, Guinness St James Gate Brewery, etc).  It is also nice and close to shopping and night spots (Temple Bar, Grafton Street, and Mary St / O'Connell St. etc).

The Westin is very new looking, even though it is in an architecturally beautiful old bank building.  The hotel has a nice bar in the lower level; it also has a comfy mezzanine level set aside for tea (drinks served there, also).  The hotel also serves a fancy breakfast buffet which we took advantage of only once;  we got tired of having breakfast at the Costa across the street.

The rooms were very nice -- very much like rooms a travel from the US would expect from a Westin.  The beds were extra plush and the shower was nice, but a little cramped.  Internet was 15E per day.  We picked rooms that had a view of the street.

We chose this hotel over the The Shelbourne -- we stayed at the Westin but we had tea at the The Shelbourne.  

We were surprised by the weather.  It wasn't as bad as we expected.  It was always above freezing and most days the Sun did peak through the clouds.    One of the days a really big gale blew over Ireland.  Dublin was nicely sheltered and it didn't interrupt our tourist activities.

The Temple Bar area was really close by.  We found it easy to get into most of the bars.  The entertainment was live and fun.  If you stood around long enough, you could get seating.  It wasn't crazy crowded.

The people at the front desk were very friendly and helpful.",5,2012,01,07
202,Stay at the Westin when in Dublin!,"Our family experience at the Westin in Dublin (at College Green) was simply wonderful.  The personable  and ever so helpful staff, the quality of the hotel, rooms, lobby, Atrium Lounge, restaurant and the food and drinks was superb.  We were there for three days over the Christmas weekend and then we were there over NYE and thoroughly enjoyed our stay.  I would highly recommend the Dublin Westin and we would always return there.",5,2012,01,06
202,Perfect Location,"I booked The Westin before Christmas because I had to meet up with friends in Dublin and I had to do some last minute Christmas shopping before returning home.
It was the perfect location, for meeting people, so central.
For shopping i could pop in and out all day.
The hotel was an oasis of order and calm from the chaos of the shops and streets.
and I had a long soak in the marble bathroom before going out that evening.",5,2012,01,06
202,Great hotel at a great location,"Stayed here on a business trip and everything about my stay was great (except for the weather but that's to be expected in Dublin).

The room size was good for an inner city hotel, bath room was luxurious and everything was well taken care of and clean. 

The bar was nice, had a couple of drinks there, excellent service.

Reception staff was nice, helpful and very efficient.

Very decent breakfast buffet

Location is perfect. Shopping and dining right outside the hotel. It's on a main street so very easy to get a cab.

Two minor dislikes:
- the number of pillows I had to throw off the bed before sleeping at night (apparently style gurus everywhere disagree with me so I will have to learn to live with that)
- I had a window that looked out on the building next door (a wall and part of the roof)
I must say I put excellent for value but I paid a contracted rate so I am not sure how pricing is normally.",5,2012,01,06
202,Must Try Harder,"Stayed here in mid-December for 4 nights booked through booking.com. The location is excellent and the rooms are nicely decorated. Classic rooms in this hotel (from a previous visit) face an enclosed courtyard- it is best to book the deluxe rooms which face onto the street. 

Here were our problems:

1. On checking in (admittedly at 1pm for a 3pm check-in) I was told that I had conformed a 'classic queen non-smoking.' In fact, I had paid extra when booking for a deluxe king room. I mentioned this to the staff member and he immediately became defensive: 'Can I see your confirmation please, he asked.' I stupidly forgot to print it but whipped out my ipad and started looking (in vain). I was offered a paid room upgrade which I declined. I said I would try to find the reservation during lunch and indeed I did. On returning, I presented the email confirmation (with room as described) to the person on the front desk (a different person). I was given the room but having to produce evidence of room booked left a sour taste in my mouth. 

2. The restaurant was full and had no space so we were unable to eat in the hotel that night. I guess it was two weeks before Christmas and the hotel was extra busy. 

3. The hotel was working on rooms on the floors above (we were on the 3rd) but were constantly being interrupted by hammering from the 'heavy maintenance.' We awoke to it even on Saturday morning. Were offered a bottle of wine as compensation but declined. A nice gesture, but no hammering would have been nicer in the weekend mornings!

4. A few days after checking out I noticed that my credit card had been charged twice. A quick email to the hotel rectified this and I subsequently received an apology for this oversight. 

5. Turn-down service, if it happens even when requested, excludes fresh towels.

All in all, not a great experience.",2,2012,01,06
202,Top hotel in a top location,"We stayed over at this hotel for New Year and had a great time, the staff were friendly and very helpful.  Couple of downsides, some temporary staff close to new year let the service down and rooms not getting cleaned until 5pm some days.  Would definately recommend it though.  Location is perfect, it is across the road one way for Trinity College and across the road the other way for Temple Bar.",4,2012,01,05
202,Best advice I can give is to stay somewhere else!,"The major problem here is this hotel is part of a chain and as such no-one takes any ownership of problems reported by customers.

 I made the booking via a call centre located in Cork and it was absolutely clear what the room rate was to be (book 2 nights get the 3rd free) and I booked 2 rooms for me and my colleague. But they overcharged me, and in the most underhand way, by making me pay up-front at the time of booking, so when I came to check out they said I had been quoted the mean rate. Luckily for me the booking was recorded by the centre and so I have eventually received a refund. However, I did not welcome being treated like a liar and a cheat!

We did not have an enjoyable stay. When we arrived late (having been on the road since 3am the morning before) we were initially disappointed with our ‚ÄòDeluxe‚Äô rooms. Mine was much smaller than I had been led to believe from thier website and my colleague‚Äôs was interconnecting to the room next door through which you could hear their television blaring out. There was practically no window, let alone one that opened and no stunning view of Dublin city centre. In fact his room looked directly into a set of glass fronted offices! The night duty manager said she would leave a note for her manager colleague the following morning suggesting we move rooms the next day. This was because there was nothing she could do on Friday night as, apart from suites, which she would give us but for more money(!), there was nothing more she could do. 

I have to admit that the bed was beautiful despite the fact that there was a large green bogie stuck to the headboard which I had to remove before getting in - yuk! But I could hear the man in the room next door on the telephone and every time people went in and out of their rooms in the corridor the walls and headboard in my room physically shook! This banging and shaking kept waking me up into the small hours until everyone was in their rooms. 

The following morning I went to reception, asking to see the duty manager as requested. I was kept waiting for over 15 minutes when eventually a member of the reception staff (Ahmed) offered to show me 2 alternative rooms. These turned out to be on the exact same corridor as the one I was already on and were just clones of my room - what was the point in moving? The duty manager failed completely to understand, or take on board, any of the points we had made the previous night and couldn‚Äôt even be bothered to see me! To help mitigate this experience on Saturday and Sunday nights I deliberately went to be very late so as not to experience the same problem with banging doors and general noise.

Whilst taking a shower the following morning the water went stone cold. Standing in a towel, with my waist length wet sudsy hair dripping down my back, I reported this to the lady on reception who had me toing and froing from the phone to the bathroom, turning various taps on and off! She eventually agreed to send up an engineer whilst I stood shivering in my towel. The engineer came as quickly as he could and he explained that sometimes the cold water entering the boiler could not be heated up in time and so the water would run cold for a few minutes and then come hot again! Surely the one thing you can rely on in any hotel is hot water? When I put the phone down to the receptionist the cable came out and the same engineer said he would come back in 3-4 hours‚Äô time to replace the flex because he was too busy trying to get around to other jobs that needed doing first.

On Saturday night after returning to the hotel we decided to go to the downstairs bar to enjoy a nightcap. The ‚Äòmusic‚Äô if that‚Äôs what you could call it, was truly horrible - a woman literally screeching out. We escaped that bar - driven out by the noise - and arrived at the Atrium only to be unceremoniously informed by a surly staff member that the bar was now closed. Undeterred, I explained we were resident but he still said no, they were closed. Venturing on, I then asked if we could have a drink from the downstairs bar up there and he eventually agreed. However we were still expected to fetch the drinks ourselves, so my colleague had to go back downstairs again to fetch the drinks. Such poor service in a 5* hotel!

Having stayed up late on Sunday night (to avoid shaking walls and headboard syndrome) I thought I would enjoy a lie-in the following morning before returning to the UK that afternoon. But even the heavenly bed couldn‚Äôt work when hammering started above my head from approximately 8.30am. After putting up with this for a couple of hours I phoned reception again to ask what was going on? Apparently there were some ‚Äòworks‚Äô taking place on the 5th floor! I appreciate that most people would be up by 8.30am but this should not be mandatory!

The hotel is in a good spot, and they do have heavenly beds and a very nice iPod radio, but other than that our experience tells us that we shall not be quick to return to the Westin. In fact I would downgrade this hotel to less than 3*. Being in business for over 30 years we have had the pleasure of visiting Dublin many times. Our hotel of choice is the properly graded 5* Merrion but to keep costs down we have recently been staying at the 3* Trinity Capital. I can tell you honestly that either of these hotels would leave the Westin standing.

Approximately 2 weeks later I received an apology from the hotel front office assistant manager who sent me a letter confirming that Starwood Customer Services, who taped my conversation with their booking clerk, had confirmed that after hearing the tape and the conversation, I was absolutely right so she arranged to refund the amount I was overcharged, 285.32 euros. This is all good and fine but in the process of seeking justice I had to suffer the indignity of being made to feel like a cheat and a liar!",1,2012,01,05
202,"Super staff, super location","We visited Ireland with our 1 year old and spent a week at the Westin in Dublin.  The staff was incredibly friendly and accommodating, our room was surprisingly large and very comfortable, and the location couldn't have been any better!",5,2012,01,05
202,Perfect!,"We found the Westin a perfect place to stay in Dublin. The location is second to none and is convenient to everything. We visited the Mint Bar on two occasions and enjoyed it immensely -- the prices are quite reasonable for a hotel bar. We also had excellent appetizers one night in the second floor lounge. 

We were upgraded to a ""Stay Fit"" suite upon check-in. It was a lovely room with a great view of Dublin and the hills in the distance. The room was spacious and comfortable. 

I would highly recommend this hotel to those visiting Dublin. I plan to return again soon myself!",5,2012,01,05
202,Westin - great city centre location,Stayed at the Westin for 3 days to attend a wedding (in the Westin). Staff are professional and friendly. The wedding arrangements were impeccable and the sit down dinner for c80 people was superb. Hotel is luxurious and plenty of spots to chill out and relax. The only negative was they charge guests for wifi access which in the 21st century is a bit anachronistic (bit like charging extra for your electricity usage).,5,2012,01,05
202,Very nice,"I really liked the Westin hotel. It's centrally located, has a great bar and a lovely homely feel. When we arrived there was a fire on and all the Christmas decorations were up. The room was average size and included a wardrobe, an iron, ironing board, and hair dryer (which I know seems like the norm but I've stayed in a few hotels recently that didn't have an ironing board and it really annoyed me).

The bathroom was great, the bath a little small but that's just me being picky as I'm 6ft 4. The shower was great though with great water pressure, which is rare in a dublin hotel.

The only reason I'm giving this hotel a 4 instead of a 5 is that I didn't really like the way the room was decorated. I know, I'm being picky but that's my honest opinion.",4,2012,01,05
202,Very good - but NOT 5 star,"Took advantage of some annual leave remaining and decided to nip to Dublin for 3 days just prior to Christmas 2011. After a ghastly Ryanair flight (well, what did we expect?) we checked in to the Westin. The room had been pre-booked on Expedia as a triple and whereas they had the booking, they did not have the triple set up. This was quickly and efficiently remedied by the friendly staff. Within an hour, it was time for us to start our holiday proper.

We had a drink in the cellar bar of the hotel (The Mint Bar) - this was very expensive at around ‚Ç¨6 per pint, around ‚Ç¨1 more than bars in the area, and the staff were not attentive. We had been told on check-in that the bar would stay open for residents until 1am however when we returned at 12:30, we were told they were now closed. We pointed out that we had returned especially for a last drink in the hotel before bed and were grudgingly  served more drinks while they 'mopped' and cleaned around us, making us feel very unwelcome at that time. Some retraining to be done here.

That evening we had been out in the Temple Bar area, Dublin's trendy area full of traditional pubs on the banks of the Liffey and cool and sophisticated bars - the hotel was in a perfect location for this area, with only Morgan's and The Clarence likely to better it in the same price range.

Two very comfortable nights sleep at The Westin, with very nice bathroom facilities and it was almost time to return. A trip to the Guinness Storehouse on our last morning, however, meant we needed to use the services of the hotel again. We had bought some brown sauce from Guinness without thinking (of course) that we would not be able to take this on our plane in hand luggage. We looked for a post office en route back to the hotel to collect our bags and head to the airport, however to no avail. So we asked the concierge if he would post the sauce back to us. This was as though it was the strangest request ever, with him questioning whether or not he would be able to get it back to us as it was technically a liquid. We pointed out that we didn't want him to fly back with it - just put it in a jiffy bag and post it. Eventually he agreed after I said I would pay the postage and he could use the same credit-card as used on check-out. I was very clear to stress not to bother if the cost was over ‚Ç¨5 - this was becoming the most expensive bottle of HP ever... We left the hotel not feeling confident that the sauce would be seen again, but it did - in-between Christmas and New Year - in the UK. So thank you for that - you saved our bacon (and sausages) so to speak, however I was a little disappointed that I was charged ‚Ç¨7.50 for this. Whenever I have asked concierge's to do this sort of thing previously (usually after leaving something like a phone charger in a room) I have NEVER been charged the postage. This is just an observation - i'm not sure i could expect this service for free, it just helps me form an opinion versus other true 5* hotels...

So overall - extremely comfortable hotel - spacious rooms, with nice facilities. It's not a boutique hotel, more traditional, but to a good standard. The front of house staff were very helpful, the Mint Bar staff need some retraining (as is often the way with younger 20 somethings in these places).

Good value - paid ¬£300 for two nights in a large triple room. Booking directly with the Westin would have been ‚Ç¨500 so shop around. They do have a price-match guarantee, but only if you show them the difference in rates within 24 hours.

Would stay again, but would probably prefer to try the Morgan Hotel or Clarence just for variety.",4,2012,01,02
202,"Great location, but could be better","As background, I have been to Ireland 6 times in the last 3 years, 2 for reconnaissance trips before my wedding at Dromoland Castle, 1 for the wedding itself and 1 for business. I have stayed at hotels with 3 stars, 4 stars and 5 stars. I stayed at the Westin during my last trip to Ireland, on business. By far, it was the most expensive hotel I stayed at in Ireland and in my opinion, it could have been better.

The location of the Westin is great. It's right next to the Trinity College and Grafton Street. It's also about 3 blocks away from the water. There is a very happening pub under the lobby of this hotel so do check it out on Fridays and Saturdays. During the day, it serves pretty good pub food. Service at this hotel is good. Checkin was a breeze, they didn't miss any of my wake up calls and the bed was very soft. I got upgraded to a corner bedroom with my personal gym in my room (stationary bike and weight machines), which was nice. The bathroom was huge with marble counters, nice tubs, good water pressure on the shower.

However, there is no free wifi anywhere in the hotel, not even in the lobby, which I have come to expect from all Irish hotels. The 8 or so hotels that I have experienced in Ireland have them at their lobby, at the very least. 

The reception area could have been bigger, I felt. This is important for check in (there is a crowd often) and when one has to wait for her colleagues in the lobby. There were just not enough room. The decoration for the hallways were also quite dark-colored, so the hallways felt dark and not light and airy, but that's a minor point.

The area outside the hotel is a little dark. By this, I mean, the lighting could be better and as soon as you get out of the hotel, the street is right there. In other words, there is no ""front porch"" area where you can, again, wait for other parties in your trip. This is a small point if you are not traveling with people though.

The business center is quite small - 2 computers, if I remember correctly. The desk in the room was quite large and comfy so you can do work there. The TV was flatscreen, very easy to use and there were all the US channels available.

I would recommend this hotel if there is a deal involved, like a discount. If not, compare this hotel with the Shelbourne and the Conrad. Both the Shelbourne and the Conrad is on the other side of Grafton Street, but that's only a 10 min brisk walk away from the Westin and you get to face St. Stephen's Green. If you have meetings by the water, however, the Westin would be closer.",3,2011,12,29
202,Centrally located hotel with a charming ambiance,"This is a must stay hotel if traveling to Dublin! The staff is friendly and helpful. The hotel is centrally located to Trinity College, shopping, Temple Bar and other cultural opportunities. The value is good for the location and proximity to services. Buy the bus fare to and from the hotel and the airport as the bus stops are within a short walking distance of the hotel. I took a point off for the room and cleanliness as there were a few stains on the hallway and room carpet that should have been cleaned as well as the fact that one of the two elevators servicing guests was out of service for the entire week we were there. Overall, however, this hotel is well worth the money.",4,2011,12,29
202,Love it!,"I have been staying in this hotel for the last 4 years just before christmas.  The staff are lovely and helpful.  They gave us great recommendations.  You can't beat the location.  By Temple Bar, trinty and O'Connell Bridge.  The rooms are lovely and if you have a Starwoods account, they will upgrade your room, if its available.  The only thing that the hotel does not have is, a bar that stays open late.  We were hoping to catch a drink at the bar after dinner, but it was closed when we got back to the hotel.",4,2011,12,28
202,Fabulous hotel.  Great central location.  Food outstanding.,"We stayed in The Westin as a treat before Christmas.  Would definitely return.  We got an upgrade on arrival, the room was spacious and beautifully decorated- massive bathroom too.  We hadn't booked parking, so had to park in a nearby multi-storey, but this was very close by.  Cost 25 euro per night, although we left the car here for most of the next day while we shopped which was handy.  Restaurant-' The Exchange' was beautiful.  Great menu, extensive wine list and excellent service.  Couldn't fault anything about the hotel.  It was a bit pricey though! But worth it.",4,2011,12,22
202,Best hotel in Dublin,"I stayed at the Westin Dublin a month ago and I wouldn't change it for any other hotel were i to go back. The room was spacious and beautiful with a great view of Dublin city. It definitely deserves its 5 star rating. The receptionist and concierge were tremendously friendly and helpful and made reservations for us as we asked them for directions! Anita, (receptionist) offered to upgrade us to a bigger room at no cost. The location of the hotel is perfect. Walking distance (2 blocks) from the temple bar area and from great restaurants, shops and sightseeing locations. I loved every minute of my stay there.",5,2011,12,14
202,Rip off Republic Still alive,"We were one one couple of 6 staying for one night. Hotel is nice, good location and the staff are Friendly. However, it is a ryanair hotel where you have to pay for every extra. We were charged ‚Ç¨25 for parking! Breakfast was extra. This is not the worst. we thought we would treat ourselves to a nice lunch in the Atrium bar. We ordered a Chicken Sandwich, a Beef Sandwich and a pot of tea. When I asked for no Onion in the Sandwich they told me that it might be a problem as it was prepared in advance! The chef However manage to scrap out the Onion!
The toasted sandwich was soggy! The chicken sandwich contained a large lump of fat. Both were served with a few crisps and a litlle bit of green lettuce. This was then served with a pot of tea that was stronger than coffee! ALL FOR THE PRICE OF ‚Ç¨37.50. You would of received better value and quality in a sandwich bar around the corner. Far fom 5 star! Will not be returning.",3,2011,12,11
202,Excellent Location,"We stayed in the Westin in Dublin over the fireworks weekend for 2 nights, i had booked the room via last minute.com and got an excellent deal (half the normal price). When we arrived we were very impressed with my choice, its a very grand looking hotel and definalty worth its star rating.
We arrived at around 9am but couldnt check in until 3pm, which was no problem as we could leave our bags in a secure room and was told we would be called as soon as our room was ready, so we went off exploring.
Excellently located to all attractions. 
The room was very small, but had luxury fixtures and fittings. The bathroom was very spacious (compared to the bedroom) and had both a shower & a bath, the fixtures were really nice but there was mould starting to grow on the ceiling above the shower & around the shower tray (which you wouldnt expect for the star rating). I did tell the receptionist on check out and she apologised. 
We were given a room overlooking the busy main side road, as we were right in the centre of Dublin, the noise was constant. We were woken up quite a few times on both nights when the emergency services went past or very loud people decided to start! I wondered if we were given this room as we were young (and they thought we would be out partying anyway & would be drunk enough to sleep through it) or because we had booked it through last minute.com (and paid less than other customers). 
Either way, i really enjoyed staying at the hotel.
We decided against breakfast in the hotel as it was quite expensive, there are alot of cafes close by at a resonable price.
Overall this hotel is lovely - just asked to be moved if you get one of those side rooms.",4,2011,12,09
202,We keep returning to this perfectly located Dublin hotel!,"Another 2 stays at the Westin Dublin went well! Rooms are usually ready early which is great after long flights and the perfect location never fails to please us. Staff is great about locking up your bags before or after checkout. We just love being so close to pubs and shopping and the train stations. A special kudos to Anita at the front desk for making us feel like welcomed friends... If you can afford the Westin, you'll be pleased with the beds, linens, tv, bathrooms, etc!",5,2011,12,06
202,Super location,"Stayed for 2 nights over the weekend for a bit of city shopping. Excellent location for both sides of town. Breakfast the first morning was excellent, second morning seemed a little less organised, the hot buffet remained empty & wasn't replenished while we were there. Also had to ask twice for coffee & toast, both of which arrived after we had finished eating!! Small things that can be so easily monitored & rectified. However, Very  friendly reception  &  concierge staff, and a very comfy bed really made for a great stay.",4,2011,12,06
202,A perfect end to our honeymoon,"We spent the last three nights of our honeymoon in the Westin and what a glorious end it was.  we were given a wonderful upgrade and offered a late check-out.  We dined in the Mint Bar one night and had afternoon tea in the Atrium, both were excellent in terms of quality, service and price.  The location of the hotel is second to none - a handy walk to all of the best that Dublin has to offer.",5,2011,12,05
202,"great hotel, located in the heart of dublin","We stayed 3 nights at Westin Dublin Hotel in november 2011. The hotel is just a 2 minute walk from Trinity College and 5 minutes away from the Temple Bar district or the shopping areas. Starbucks in eye sight! The hotel staff was very friendly when we arrived late at night, and our deluxe room was spacious and clean, the A/C was good, and the bed was amazing. 3 nights of quality sleeping! Nice bathroom with double doors and a bathtub. Robes. In room coffee maker and minibar. The breakfast was not included in our booking, but there are alot of choices in the nearby area - try for instance the bagel shop right across the street. Amazing bagels. All inn all a nice stay, the best thing is the location!",4,2011,12,03
202,Comfortable Hotel - Fantastic Location,Stayed at Westin for a long weekend and was very pleased with the hotel. The location is perfect for Temple Bar and the south of the city and Grafton Street's shopping area. The service in the hotel was very good and the receptionist and concierge were very helpful. This hotel is rated as five star but does lack the associated leisure facilities. Having said that the fitness suite isn't too bad and there is a pretty decent range of equipment. Furthermore the return air coach to the airport goes from right outside of the hotel. All in all a very pleasant stay and would definitely visit again if I could secure the same kind of rates. Would recommend to others....,5,2011,11,30
202,Great days in Dublin,"Just went home from 3 great days in Dublin.
Perfect location. Temple Bar across the road and shopping streets a few minnutes walk.",5,2011,11,30
202,best hotel,"this hotel is in the centre of town it is a beautifull hotel, very private, very upmarket, to go here after a days  shopping and relax in the atrium is like a haven the staff who are very very helpfull try to make you feel so comfortable  and relaxed you dont want to leave the restaurant  which serves very affordable food is where you want to bring your friends you will impress them with the food and the service .",5,2011,11,29
202,A Wonderful Weekend in Dublin,"My husband and I booked a very last minute trip to Dublin for a long weekend.  We booked the Westin only because we do try to stay in Westin hotels when traveling (we know they are typically a good quality hotel for the price).   I had 1 day to do some pre-planning for our trip, so I reached out to the concierge at the Westin.  What a wonderful, stress-free experience.  The concierge arranged everything for us from having a car waiting at the airport for us upon arrival to arranging for a private tour of Dublin for Saturday and made spectacular recommendations for restaurants for dinner.
When we arrived at the Westin, we were very pleasantly surprised at not only how nice and clean the hotel was, but also at the central location (across the street from Trinity College and within a very short walk to both Grafton Street and Temple Bar).  
The sleeping rooms were very spacious as was the beautiful marble bathroom.  
The staff at the hotel was extremely friendly and accommodating as well as professional.  
Excellent, first class hotel.  I would never stay anywhere else while visiting Dublin.",5,2011,11,28
202,"One night stay,amazing!!","Five adults checked into this hotel on a busy saturday,first off we just had to send in someone from our group to check where could we park. My mother went in and came out with this friendly Man who informed us that he would park our car as the parking was a bit away which is understandable because of the location of the hotel right in the city centre. We checked in at 3pm and headed to our room. I was staying on the 5th floor of the hotel with my sister and had a big balcony looking over Dublin city. My Parents were on the 3rd floor. We were attending a function in the city at 7 so we headed down to the lobby at quarter past 6 where there were a number of taxi's outside the hotel but not one that would be able to hold 5. The Concierage came straight over to us(the man that parked our car) and said he would get a taxi in a minute. he walked out on to the street and hailed one down for us which was lovely as we were all in dresses. The next morning we woke very hungry for breakfast,we went down to find a lovely spread,hugh choice and anything you could ask for. The waffels were lovely and the orange juice was freshly squeesed i'd say. All i can say is that it was a lovely one night stay. The only thing we would complain about is the room on the 3rd floor my father said it was very hot even with the thermostat to the lowest however there was only one window in the room,it would not open and the room was a bit hot during the night. only a minor thing really.",5,2011,11,27
202,Great Two Day Escape,"Decided to do a weekend stop-over in Dublin at the end of a business trip to Europe. Even though is was drizzling for the entire weekend, had an amazing trip due to the professionalism of the Westin Dublin.  Excellent first class hotel, highly recommend.  I will not bother staying anywhere else on my next visit.

Service was delightful, helpful, and genuine. Fun old converted bank building with lots of character.  Perfectly located within walking distance of everything you will want to explore in Dublin.  And to top it off, a great restaurant with the most amazing waffles for breakfast.  Have to share this story. I requested the recipe for the waffles.  The staff said the pastry chef was off that day, but would get it from her when she returned and then send it up to my room.  It never showed, but two days after I returned home, there is was in my email inbox with a very sweet note fromt the staff.  Love attention to detail like that, made me feel very special.

Rooms are pleasant enough, well equipped, and good size - with great bathrooms and comfortable beds.",5,2011,11,27
202,Very nice indeed,"We had an unexpected stay here as we were supposed to stay in another hotel but they had over booked us.  We definately got the better end of the deal.  Really close to Trinity College and Grafton Street. Rooms were really spacious and the bathroom is big enough to have a party in.  Added bonus of an Ipod dock, esp as I had forgotten my iphone charger!  Lovely and quiet. 

Only thing was the view from our room was an office block where you could see everyone and everyone could see you, so make sure the curtains are closed!",5,2011,11,27
202,Convenient luxury hotel in Dublin,"Luxury hotel in a wonderful location near Temple Bar and Trinity College.  We were upgraded to a suite due to Platinum status with SPG and it was a stunning two-level room with a spiral wrought iron stair case.

Staff was friendly and accommodating.  I'd highly recommend this location and hotel for a great visit to Dublin.",4,2011,11,22
202,"Great location, nice friendly staff","We booked the Westin for one night through www.lastminute.com. We pre-booked the car and pulled up outside the hotel and found someone who took the car for us and valet parked it.
The receptionist was very nice and friendly - not overly so.  Just enough to make you feel 
welcome.  Our room was on the first floor with a street facing view (we were given the option of
street facing or atrium facing).  The room was spacious and classical in style.  The bathroom 
was large with a separate shower - which is nice. The bed was very comfortable.  I didn't like the bedding - it was the sheet with two duvet and another sheet on top type of situtaion rather than an enclosed duvet cover.  So when I woke in the morning everything was separated.   Didn't eat in the hotel but had drinks in the 
Atrium bar - again found the staff to be very courtesous and professional.  Only negative and its a very personal view so wouldn't be an issue for majority of people.  We wanted to watch a rugby match in the bar downstairs.  However another guest had requested a soccer match and even though its a massive bar with multiple screens - they could not split and show both matches.  As I said - not really a negative but would have been nice if we could have stayed there to have food and drinks while watching the match.  The excellent location of the Westin meant we didn't have to travel too far to find an alternative.",4,2011,11,22
202,Great Location,"This is a first class hotel in a great location perfect for both a business trip and a short city break. The rooms are very well furnished and feature the superb Westin comfy beds. We did not eat in the hotel although we did have the afternoon tea in the Atrium Lounge and whilst it took a little while to arrive, about 30 mins, it was worth the wait. Within a short walk there are some great restaurants and bars ranging from the tourist traps of the Temple Bar to some friendly old fashioned ""proper"" pubs.",4,2011,11,20
202,Nice hotel and pleasant front desk.  Restaurant had very slow service.,Room was quite nice and clean.  Quiet.  Top notch amenities.  Had breakfast in the restaurant - service was very slow and the buffet table was satisfactory.  Not the place to go if you were in a bit of a rush.  Did not use other amenities that the hotel offered.  On a busy and very lively street but no street noise found its way into our room.  Ideally located for tourists and business dealings.,4,2011,11,18
202,Excellent. Perfect for business travelers,"I stayed at The Westin Dublin 2 times. High quality of service, courtesy, quietness, fantastic location in the city next to Trinity College and in front of Temple Bar, close to Airport and Business Centers. Large rooms well equipped and really comfortable. I would definitely recommend it to anybody but perfect for business travelers.

202,Top service,"Me and my wife stayed at the Hilton hotel  last week and we end up coming to eat at the restaurant in the hotel, we had a fantastic time, the host in the restaurant and our waitress made our day, my wife especially was impress with the deco and style of the restaurant, the music was too loud but overall we enjoyed the food and one of the best service we've had in our years of dining out,our waitress was very efficient and a lil star, her name is buckaola. She recommended Xmas day lunch as a must, me and my wife will definitely return for that. ",5,2011,11,14
202,Great location and lovely staff,"We stayed here on a last minute booking and loved it. We were sorry not to have used the hotel facilities other than The Mint Bar which had a good cocktail list but was very noisy. The bed as with all Westin Hotels was ""heavenly"".",5,2011,11,10
202,Excellent hotel in an excellent location,"We booked this hotel on lastminute.com and I was a bit concerned as previous reviews from customers booking this way were negative. Upon arrival at the hotel we were greated by the conceriege and our car was taken straight away. The staff are very pleasant and nothing is too much trouble. Check in was swift and we had a welcome suprise of an upgrade to a deluxe room. We were not disappointed, the room was decorated really well very old charm which is welcoming. The central location is second to none and the room although facing onto the street was very quiet. The bed was really comfy and the room was very clean. We were only at the hotel for one night so we did not eat there or have a drink in the bar but it looked really nice. I would not hesitate in recommending this hotel to anyone and we will definately be back hopefully next month!!",5,2011,11,07
202,First impressions count,"I am a regular traveller to Dublin and normally stay at a very good rival hotel whilst in the city. However on my last trip my usual hotel was fully booked so decided to try The Westin.
Upon arrival I was slightly concerned as I was driving and had to double park on a busy city centre road. However, within seconds the concierge was at the door of the car and taking control. After a warm welcome my bags and I were whisked swiftly into the lobby. My car was taken to The Westin car park.
Check in staff were very friendly and helpful. My room was very nice and the beds are extremely comfortable. The staff came up trumps when I ask them to recommend a restaurant for the evening. I took a drink in the basement bar which is a very impressive room with a great atmosphere, with a mix of residents and transient workers taking a drink on their way home. Over all a great hotel with superb staff and rooms. I will stay again!",5,2011,11,06
202,Renovated Bank now an amazing hotel,"Location of this old renovated bank is the best. Right downtown across from Temple Bar entertainment district and Trinity College. Happening spot but rooms are quiet and full of old Irish charm. Old bank vault is now converted jazz bar. Central location so within walking of shopping, bars, and nightclubs. Airport bus stops right outside and taxis are plenty.",4,2011,11,05
202,"Nice Location, Old World Charm",Location is definitely the best as it is in middle of all the hot spots. Airport bus also stops directly outside and neighbourhood is buzzing round the clock. Rooms are outdated and as per Victorian era taste but some rooms do have a nice view overlooking the main street. Overall not a bad bet considering you get all the SPG ameneties minus the free breakfast.,3,2011,11,04
202,Fantastic hotel - excellent location,"I stayed at the Westin Dublin for 2 nights this past weekend.  This property is in the perfect location for a visit to Dublin.  It is located just steps away from Trinity College and Temple Bar. Each and every member of staff was extremely helpful and kind.  The food in the Mint Bar was great and jazz night on Saturday evening was lovely.  My room, which overlooked the atrium area, was terrific and the bed was a slice of heaven!",5,2011,11,03
202,Spot On - Excellent Location and Comfortable Stay,"I stayed here with an overseas friend, and it was exactly what we needed. A stones throw from bars, restaurants and shopping areas. Didn't get any noise disturbances from neighboring rooms or traffic, even though there were bus stops and a crazy amount of traffic just below us. 

Gems - The bed.... absolute heaven.... could have slept in it for a million years! Concierge and reception went out of their way to suggest and book us in to a 'traditional Irish' eatery...silly us left it until late on a Saturday afternoon so it was not the easiest job! Everything you needed was in the room, including a lovely fluffy dressing gown (bizarre just one though and not one each!) Huge shiny bathroom, fast speed WiFi and yummy late night room service. Excellent music/live band in the Mint bar playing as we stumbled in late evening.

As I work in the Hotel industry it's easy to spot negatives, but nothing that really deserves a comment further than - yes, extras are expensive, but you are in a hotel, and you pay for a good service! The Westin Dublin certainly delivered.

We would definitely stay here again. The Hotel is grand, yet warm and welcoming. Everything works well to make it a comfortable and enjoyable stay.... After spending all our pocket money, even the cheap shuttle bus back to the airport was literally on the door step.

Spot on!",5,2011,11,02
202,"Excellent location, but not perfect","The location of the Westin is its main selling point. It's a stone's throw away from Trinity College and walking distance to Temple Bar, and all the main tourist/downtown areas of Dublin. It's everything that you expect at a Westin. Our upgraded room faced the center courtyard, which enabled a quiet evening; it was a bit of an odd layout, almost like an L-shape, with an office nook, which turned out to be helpful. I just wish there were more socket plugs! We had to rotate our charges for our phones and laptops... Internet is pricey, and there is no free internet anywhere in the hotel.. The bathroom was spacious, we had both a soaking tub and a shower (lots of marble).. The gym was adequate (treadmill, stairmaster, bike, elliptical, some free weights, and 2 weight machines) but far away from the elevator (I felt like I was in a maze wandering the hallways to get to the gym). 
It fulfilled all of our needs, and it worked like a Westin, which was great, since we were on business...",4,2011,10,31
202,Excellent but a few gripes,"Having stayed several times this year at the Westin it has become my hotel of choice in Dublin. Its location is excellent, next to Trinity and with the bus stop to the airport almost in front of the hotel it is not necessary to use a taxi. The rooms are comfortable and of good size and the overall service has always been excellent. However, despite my very positive overall view I do have a few gripes. Firstly, EUR 15 for 24 hour internet access is simply outrageous. Secondly, make sure that if you use more than one device that you check your bill to ensure you have not been charged per device. The front desk was unable to answer why they just cannot invoice the flat rate. On a positive note the cost of breakfast, especially the buffet, seems to have been reduced and it is overall excellent and nowadays much better value. The Mint Bar in the hotel is a rather dull place and there are much better and livelier pubs nearby. Overall, however, a very good choice.",5,2011,10,30
202,Perfect location,"I stayed here for business with a colleague.  The Westin is located perfectly for Temple Bar, Trinity and Grafton St.  Very clean and hard to fault.",4,2011,10,30
202,"nice hotel, but not 5 star","The Weston Hotel is certainly in an excellent location in Dublin, central and within walking distance of all the shopping ang nightlife areas of Dublin.

The reception staff are very friendly and efficient and the check in process was completed in a few minutes. Our room was not ready so we left our bads and headed out around the city. When we returned our bags were in our room.

The room was average size, clean , comfortable and quiet considering it was looking out onto the street. We had a good nights sleep with no noise interruption,. but the beds are far too soft. 

We are not fussy people when it comes to staying in hotels, but this is by no means a 5 star hotel. I would rate it was a middle of the road 4 star hotel. Some of furntiure in the rooms is cheap (chipboard table covered with cloth as bedside locker), bathrooms very dated, need modernisaiton and shower needed an overhaul (dirty silicon etc).

In a 5 star hotel you expect the wow factor, and apart from the amazing central atrium, this hotel does not have it.

We booked this hotel via a travel website and obtained at 45% discount on the list price of this room. Even at the reduced price, I would not consider it to be good value for money when you look at other hotels in Dublin.

To summarise, not 5 star, didn't live up to our expectations of a 5 star. Evern though it was a pleasant stay with no major issues, we won't be revisiting!",3,2011,10,24
202,"Staying at the Westin in Dublin, Ireland","Staying at the Westin in Dublin, Ireland was a great decision.  The hotel is located very close to all the services & sites within the city.  The staff was extremely helpful, the rooms impeccably clean, and the beds were extremely comfortable.  On the night of your arrival you get to your room after a day of touring to find a bowl of fresh fruit, and a decanter of chilled water.  What a pleasant and thoughtful touch!  You would not be disappointed should you decide to select this hotel as the base for touring Dublin proper.",5,2011,10,23
202,"Best Location Possible in the City Center, Yet Quiet","This was my first trip to Dublin. Stayed 2 nights at this centrally located hotel right in the middle of everything.  Pleasant staff, fantastic Mint Bar downstairs, wonderful high tea in the afternoon, and 2 free computers with printers in the business center.  I stayed on the 5th floor, and did not hear a single street sound even though I am sensitive to noise and there was traffic outside and bars in the area.   

The hotel was converted from a bank 10 years ago, so everything is relatively new.  Bathroom seemed brand new, yet I don't like taking a shower in a bathtub which is hard to get in and out of.

Downsides were no complimentary newspaper, or any newspaper about, no complimentary breakfast or club lounge for Platinum SPG members, small fitness center, much smaller room than I expected although it did have a balcony, and small lobby area to sit and watch people come in and out of the hotel.  Supber Irish food at Gallaghers just 1 block away in Temple Bar area - check it out.

Yes, I will stay at this Westin hotel again, and I do recommend it.",4,2011,10,17
202,I dreamt I dwelt in marble halls,"Spent 3 nights at the Westin while in Dublin for a conference.  Although I arrived at 10.30 am I was immediately offered a quiet room overlooking Trinity Collge.  The room was well appointed, with  a comfortable bed.  I was on a room-only deal but the 9,95 euro hot business breakfast was fair value for a posh hotel and was an alternative to going outside for breakfast, athough the overloud muzak can be painful the morning after a night of intensive conferencing...  The Westin has been open about 10 years.  The reception area is somewhat low key and ""club"" style. Presumably the building was - or some of it was - a marbled banking hall.  Its present usage probably serves society better.",4,2011,10,16
202,"Great Central Location, Nice Connecting Rooms for Families","I have stayed here many times on both Family trips and long rugby weekends. A great, central hotel with all of the amenities. Large bathrooms for a European hotel and big, comfortable rooms. Staff is very helpful and location is absolutely central.",4,2011,10,15
202,Highly recommend,"Just returned from a 5 night stay at the Westin Dublin. It's a lovely, clean hotel, very centrally located, close to Trinity College, Temple Bar, Grafton St., etc.; within easy walking distance to many restaurants, Dublin Castle and other attractions.

The room was a good size, with a very large bathroom. The beds were very comfortable. The concierge was very helpful too.

I would highly recommend the hotel.",5,2011,10,12
202,Westin Dublin,This is a great Hotel everything was perfect. Will definately stay again.,5,2011,10,11
202,Perfect hotel,"We were at the Westin for 3 nights. This was my fifth time in Dublin, but I've never stayed at a hotel this perfect. The location is great, you can walk everywhere within five minutes. The room was big, clean, classique and romantic - and with a huge and beautiful bathroom with both bathtub and shower. Great hotel!",5,2011,10,11
202,Great location - shame about the room,"Just back from a Saturday night stay in this hotel and unfortunately it was a big disappointment. We booked hotel through last minute.com (secret hotel) and I was delighted to get a confirmation for the Westin as it really has a super location just opposite Temple Bar and short stroll to Grafton st or Henry st. We were checked in straight away (1pm) which was a nice surprise but we were in for a big disappointment when we got to our room. It was very basic room definitely in need of renovation and situated at a very strange angle but the biggest dissapointment was the double bed. When staying in a 5 star hotel (have stayed in plenty) I would expect to have at least a kingsize bed if not a superking. My husband does not like complaining so we headed off for lunch and to see the sights of the city. On arrival back to the hotel while getting ready for a night out I discovered there was only 1 bathrobe in the wardrobe which then led me to the conclusion we were booked into a single room. As we had a table booked we has no time to approach staff to be moved so I did this on my return. I discovered there were other rooms in the same category with kingsize beds but typical they were all booked out and I could ""upgrade"" by paying a supplement to the next category. Needless to say I was not shelling out more money ( we paid ‚Ç¨140 for room only). The whole experience left a a bitter taste of rip off Ireland and needless to say I will not be staying in this hotel again so I am just writing this review to warn any other bookers of last minute. com....be aware of being squashed into a single room. Also you could not open the windows in this box room so we were roasted at the same time!!!",2,2011,10,10
202,Great time!,"The Westin has a great central location (ideal for sightseeing) in this fabulous city, king deluxe room was very clean and comfortable, bathroom great size. Restaurants and lounges were superb, I can't stop raving about the food. We had a 3rd floor room overlooking Westmoreland Street, a little noisy from the bus traffic. Concierge was a little ""rushed"" but he was legitimately busy, as in anyt trip take evrything witha grain of patience. All staff went out of their way to see we were at home, cheerful and helpful. Would return in a heartbeat! Thanks Westin Dublin!",4,2011,10,06
202,"Great location, nice hotel, small room","The Westin is in a fantastic location, close to the river, Grafton Street, Temple Bar, Trinity College and near several of the hop on-hop off tour bus stops.  Also very close to the airport shuttle bus stop.  Entrance and reception area very nice, with helpful staff.  Our room was very small, with a regular double bed, and only one robe in the wardrobe - it felt as if it was usually sold as a single room.  It did have a spacious bathroom though with both bath and separate shower.  All clean and tidy, but with no special touches that you expect of a 5 star hotel.  A nice surprise on the first night was a complimentary dessert delivered to our room as it had been noted on our booking that it was my boyfriend's birthday that weekend.  We did not eat at the hotel or use the bar or gym, so I cannot comment on these facilities.  Internet was 15 euros/night, so we didn't bother.  Having booked the room through Priceline we were fairly happy with the cost (¬£110/night in total), however if we had paid the much higher rate quoted by the hotel direct or on other comparison sites I think we would have been disappointed by the room.  Great location though as I say, and for that we would consider staying here again.",4,2011,10,05
202,Got what we paid for at ‚Ç¨150.,"Good 5*, location couldn't be better for city centre activities. Rooms a bit pokey, but decor is very nice. Beds are amazing! We slept like logs. Had an early am wake up call to watch Italy v Ireland rugby match on the 32' philip's tv. All the trappings of a 5*. Porter was busy surfing the web upon our arrival---no eye contact, dismissed us to his colleague---not good behaviour. Go to the back room if you're going to be enthralled by something other than your fabulous hard earned money paying customers! We found some food (from a previous guest) in the mini bar. Yuck! Also, there was only one robe in our closet upon our arrival. Tut tut. They gave us a small midnight treat as it was our anniversary. Nice. ",4,2011,10,02
202,Wonderful Westin,"Close to everything we wanted to see in Dublin. Great help from the staff in accommodating us to book a second night after we arrived. Peter the doorman is a jewel. He enjoys his job and knows everything! And the bed was comfortable, as expected.",5,2011,09,29
202,"very well situated, very comfortable and very elegant... very good!","I stayed here from Sep-22 to Sep 26 with my wife and as much as we enjoyed our short visit to Dublin we enjoyed staying here... We stayed at one of the new rooms, though the amenities are very modern the feel of the room was very classicly elegant and yet made us feel comfortable that we wanted to come back and rest for a few hours between our busy schedules. I would highly recommend it!",4,2011,09,28
202,Very bad value for money,"The list of problems with this hotel was seemingly endless:
- the kind suggestion of booking an extra night at the start of my stay when I asked if I could check in early - one of a number of notable opportunities were it felt the Westin was only there to get as much money from me as possible
- check-in staff who told me absolutely nothing about check-out time, breakfast, etc - though to be fair, the staff didn't seem to know anything about Dublin either.  No information in the room either incidentally.
- a fifteen Euro daily charge for internet use - having already paid over 200 euro per night for the room
- awful, lumpy, flabby pillows that led to a really bad night's sleep
- something red spattered on the wall next to the bath (I didn't ask)
- a television system that seemed designed to trick you into paying for stuff 
- a cooked breakfast (another fifteen Euro) with meat that was of such abominable quality you wouldn't have fed it to your dog

Other aspects were fine, but for a luxury hotel, this was a total shambles.  Wouldn't stay again if you paid me.  But because there is such a lack of accommodation in Dublin, they'll continue to rake in the money - a crying shame.",2,2011,09,27
202,"Great location, friendly staff","My wife and I have stayed at several Westin hotels in the U.S.; this was our first stay at one abroad. We loved it. The facilities and atmosphere were top-notch. Euro hotels are expensive, but the service and location were great for U.S. tourists. Nice bathroom and bed, too.",5,2011,09,27
202,Great location for a Dublin Centric trip,"I stayed at the Westin in July of 2011.  It is steps away from Temple Bar, great restaurants, bars and shopping.  The room was spacious, clean and the beds definately were ""heavenly"".  I had breakfast at the main restaurant each morning and the soda bread was authentic and delicious.  

I would stay at this Westin again in a heartbeat.",5,2011,09,26
202,"A brief, but delightful stay","Coming from the sunny south of France we were greeted by a cold, rainy Irish day on arrival at the Dublin airport, but the attentive, welcoming friendliness of the folks at the Westin Dublin provided all the warmth we needed to ease our return to the ""north"" in Autumn.  The rooms are spacious and beautifully appointed and the fine folks at the front desk couldn't be more gracious.  Great location for sights and shopping!
We will definitely return when we can stay a bit longer.",5,2011,09,26
202,Excellent base for business meetings,"Excellent facility, attentive staff, conveniently located in city centre beside Trinity College, parking taken care of very efficiently by hotel porter.

International business colleagues remarked on lack of local knowledge by some hotel staff.",5,2011,09,24
202,Perfect place in Dublin,"Great Hotel, Great food, Great bar in the basement which was a bank vault many years ago.  Great location, close to every thing.  Hop on a Double Decker bus to tour the city right across the street. ATM right out the front door. I will go back..Doug",5,2011,09,20
202,"Well located, with great staff","We stayed for three nights in September 2011. Greeted by Doorman Peter Nolan (who can easily charm your socks off with his ruddy Irish face, broad brogue, and utter enjoyment of his job) we were impressed with the professional and very helpful staff. Surprisingly though, many are from Eastern Europe, all with excellent English. Located just near Trinity College, the hotel room was modest in size and well equipped. We had a series of small problems with the room. When I brought this to the attention of Maggie, the Duty manager, we were upgraded to a beautiful suite for our last night. Overall, a very pleasant stay.",5,2011,09,19
202,Westin Dublin - Truly Excellent,"From check-in to check-out and everything in between, my stay at the Westin Dublin was truly excellent.  It is in a superb location, and the building itself is of historic interest.  The staff was extremely helpful, caring, and knowledgable.  The room was lovely, and the facilities were great.  The fitness center is small but very functional.  It is a five-star hotel and experience all the way!",5,2011,09,16
202,Disappointing,"The Westin Dublin is centrally located and makes imaginative use of the former Allied Bank building but in many respects our stay in the hotel was a disappointment. The ground-floor  entrance to the hotel is small and lacks any facilities in which to sit and wait for visitors. There is also no space at the entrance for cars to park briefly while meeting a guest in the hotel. Similarly the guest rooms are cramped and somewhat lacking in amenities. We found that the restaurant is unsatisfactory, with unappetising food and inordinately slow service. The compensation is that there are many better restraurants within a short walking distance.The nearby Westbury Hotel is considerably superior in almost every respect.",3,2011,09,14
202,Great stay!,"We stayed at the Westin Dublin for 5 nights and had a wonderful stay. Great location near Trinity College and the Tourist Information Centre where our tours started from, helpful staff, good restuarants. On the edge of the Temple Bar area but no noise. Would definitely stay again!",5,2011,09,14
202,City centre hotel - enjoyable stay,"Nice hotel, good central location. Only drawback is that car parking is very expensive in nearby car park and validation only gives a very small discount.",5,2011,09,13
202,Great Hotel & Super Location,"We thought this hotel was outstanding.  Perfect location close to Trinity College, Grafton Street, and Temple Bar area.  All these were within 2 to 3 blocks of the hotel.  Front desk staff was very helpful and friendly.  Would stay there again in a heartbeat and hope we get the chance.",5,2011,09,12
202,"Great Location, Wonderful Staff","Spent two nights at this great hotel.  Good location for first time Dublin visitors.  Room was very comfortable (although a bit ""stuffy"" one night).  Staff was wonderful, very helpful and professional.  Offered suggestions for good restaurants, sightseeing, etc.  Extremely helpful in getting us off to the next part of our vacation - cab was waiting with our luggage loaded when we got back from lunch.  We'd stay there again on our next visit to Dublin.",5,2011,09,12
202,Quiet comfort a block from Liffey & O'Connell Bridge,"My room overlooked the atrium lobby.  I had a Walk-in shower & nice tub.  There was a speaker in the bathroom so I could hear the TV.  Formal restaurant was closed the weekend I was there so I had a nice lunch in the basement pub.  There is formal afternoon tea in the atrium.  I walked to Grafton St, St. Teresa Church, Abbey Theatre, Stephen's Green, Trinity College, etc.  The Viking Splash was the best tour.  Airport bus stops across the street or take 747 (?) bus 2 blocks away near  College Green.",5,2011,09,10
202,"Great Hotel, Perfect Location","The Westin Dublin is a block from the gates of Trinity College.  My daughter and I were in Dublin for four days as tourists, and found the location perfect for what we were intersted in.  It was walking distance from Trinity College, Grafton Street, St. Stephen's Green, Temple Bar, O'Connell Street, the Archaeology Museum, and so much more.  Admittedly, we love to walk (we call it ""Endurance Tourism"") but we only needed one cab and a couple of tram and bus rides the whole time we were in Dublin.  Am Ex Platinum got us an upgrade and breakfast, which made the hotel a good value too.

What we really liked is the way the hotel went out of its way to accommodate our particular schedule.  Two of our four days we had to leave early, before the restaurant opened, and once even before regular breakfast service in the room was scheduled to begin, and each time, they brought breakfast to our room as early as we needed it.  That really helped to make our stay enjoyable.",5,2011,09,06
202,A Special Occasion,"My husband and I chose the city of Dublin and staying at the Westin to celebrate a significant anniversary, fifty years married. Our early arrival did not present a problem, we were anticipated with smiles, Celtic charm and cake! Our room was large, lovely overlooking Westmoreland Street with all of its bubbly activity. The staff was a delight always a good morning or good evening, we certainly felt welcome and safe as first time visitors to this friendly city. The Westin made a special occasion very special indeed.
I must mention that the Westin Dublin is not only centrally located to all that Dublin has to offer a visitor, but, it‚Äôs location is kind to people who enjoy getting to know a city by walking about. We walked and walked always knowing at the end would be our lovely room and comfy bed. 
A suggestion for people who would like to visit a well stocked food emporium, we suggest Fallon and Byrne on 11-17 Exchequer Street. Here you can make up a take out or go down the stairs for a sit down, casual and fun, tasty too.",5,2011,09,06
202,Unless you are in a suit don't stay here,"Great location, good rooms we upgraded to Oscar Wilde Suite it did cost nearly 300 euros a night which we happily paid but  we checked in on the Sunday with a lot of bags, we were dressed in jeans and jumpers and the concierge looked at us as if what are you doing here ( never judge a book by its cover} and I thought jobs were tough here in Ireland. He never offered to help. Then every time we go through reception no one speaks or smiles { this is unusual in Ireland everywhere else was great ) they are not rude there is no love here. We had a problem after I paid the bill the day before we left to go back to Tasmania and the girl at reception made a mistake and Diego the front office Manager was great he fixed the problem and by the way the young lady was lovely and we told him of our experience's. I came back to the hotel two and half hours later and I walked in and two of the male staff again one was a conceirge and I said good afternoon they didn't break their conversation with each other and did'nt speak , again I was in jeans and jumper. Westin Management send these guys back where they come from and employ some of the staff from pubs in the Temple bar area they are polite and they know how to look after the tourist and lets face thats what you need is the tourist dollar. Maybe we have been unlucky but we have just been in Russia and stayed at W Hotel in St Petersburg and the staff were wonderful and I thought the Russians were supposed to be very reserved and the Irish were supposed to be friendly, but maybe the are better trained, next time I will bring a suit.",3,2011,09,06
202,Great option for touring Dublin,"I had narrowed my hotel choices to four luxury hotels in the city center part of Dublin: Westin, Fitzwilliam, Westbury & Shelbourne. I eventually decided to go with Westin for their brand name and my SPG membership. We were not disappointed. The location just across from Temple Bar cannot be beat. Our room was very quiet, and I was particularly pleased with the bathroom and shower. Their service was first rate - I left the power cord for my shaver in their room, they mailed it promptly to my home address in the US.

Some useful tips for the travelers:
1. The aircoach stop is right across the street for the way back to the airport, although you have to get off a Trinity College when you come into Dublin from the airport and walk a block and half.
2. There is a Tesco right across the street when walking towards Temple Bar. You can buy basic supplies such as water and SIM card at a fraction of price that you would pay elsewhere.
3. Although Merrion Hotel's afternoon tea is the most sought after (you are paying a premium to have tea in the midst of their art collection), I would suggest going to the Westbury for the afternoon tea. Much nicer ambiance and more modern and trendy setting.
4. Recommended places for Dinner: Pig's Ear. Breakfast: KC Peaches, Lunch/Coffee Break: The Bakehouse.",5,2011,09,05
202,Loved our stay and will return!,"We booked the Westin for a (reserved) 'hen do' for 22 ladies. From booking to departure, every aspect of our experience was excellent. 22 guests on a weekend package with a number of different elements does require a lot of organisation but everything was great - every single member of staff was professional, super friendly and helpful. The rooms were very good, as was the food and service. Also, the whole package was terrific value. Ultimately, the Westin delivered everything that they promised and more. Well done!",5,2011,09,05
202,Noisy,This hotel is very noisy. The walls are paper thin and you can hear conversations people are having down in the street and in the other rooms which makes it difficult to sleep. This hotel charges 6 euro for an hour of wireless internet or 10 euro a day when other places offer it for free. Their prices for meals are outrageous. I asked for a wake up call at 5:30 am for an early tour I booked but the call was never made. I love Dublin and will visit here again but I will never stay at this hotel again.,2,2011,09,05
202,"Amazing hotel, great location, friendly people.","

202,Beautiful Hotel with lots of space to meet up with friends,"Hotel had great places to walk around and lounge. We were meeting up with other families and there was a great place to sit upstairs to wait. while we waited the staff brought us tea and scones.  It was such a beautiful surrounding.  The rooms were large and we had a connecting room for our kids. Plenty of space to unpack and relax. Clean and luxurious.
would go back there in a heartbeat.",5,2011,09,03
202,"wonderful time, really hated to leave","Beautifully appointed hotel, incredibly close to many attractions.  Lots of dining and entertainment options within walking distance.  Decided to pay for a suite upgrade -- very deluxe accommodations.  We will never forget our stay!",5,2011,08,31
202,A wonderful afternoon tea treat,"We didn't stay at the Westin, although we'd love to, but did enjoy afternoon tea in the Atrium.  There are two afternoon teas on offer, traditional and the Atrium which is more unusual, we ordered one of each so we could share.  The food was delicious and beautifully presented.

The Atrium is a beautiful space, light and airy, although there is no natural daylight.  It is quiet and very comfortable.

Service was discreet and friendly.

We'd certainly recommend it and would love to go back.",4,2011,08,31
202,Perfect Hotel in Dublin,"Westin Dublin is, without a doubt, one of my favorite hotels ....bar none. Perfect location, extremely professional and courteous staff, beautiful rooms, awesome marble bathrooms, incredible architecture. Don't waste your time looking elsewhere, if you want a grand hotel in a great location, convenient to Temple Bar, this is the ticket. Enjoy your stay!!!",5,2011,08,30
202,2nd time and counting.....,"The Westin is my absolute favorite place to stay when in Dublin. The location is great - right next door to Trinity College, Temple Bar and also close to St. Stephens Green and Dublin Castle.  The staff is incredibly friendly and accommodating. When you stay, definitely visit the 'vault bar' downstairs.  My husband and I loved the bartender (Lewis), who we remembered from our previous visit.  He was very personable and knowledgable of places to visit and the best restaurant to try.  The rooms are extremely comfortable; I actually slept better there than I do at home. I wish all places were as hospitable as this hotel. You will love your stay!",5,2011,08,29
202,Fantastic location,"My husband and I stayed at this hotel with our 21 year old sons.  We got this hotel for a very good price through Priceline - Name Your Price and were extremely pleased with it.  First, and foremost, is its location.  It is just over the road from Temple Bar and around the corner from Trinity College.  Both our rooms looked out on to the main road facing the start of Temple Bar and, admittedly we were there on a Sunday and Monday nights, but we did not encounter any noise at all.  

The rooms were very nicely decorated in a traditional manner.  The bathroom was large with a separate shower and bath.

All the staff we encountered were so very pleasant and helpful.  

If we return to Dublin we would love to stay at this hotel again.",5,2011,08,29
202,Return visit,"On arrival at Westin we were greeted warmly by the staff due to early arrival our check in was completed and bags stored for later collection and room allocation. Breakfast was in Bewlays fantastic hard to imagine you were sitting in the middle of Dublin Great breakfast and friendly attentive staff.

Twin room spacious,clean, beautiful bathroom,well ventilated. No great view but when you are staying such a short time nothing to worry about. Central location for ALL amenities and walking to and from venues very easy. Airport bus stops just outside Westin for return flights.

Viking tour splash NOT  to be missed - Fantastic. What a way to tour Dublin and the commentary was brilliant encouraging all on board to participate great gift. Plenty of street artists showing their products leaving you spoiled for choice in the purchasing department.

St Stephens green and park beautiful to work around place for children to play within sight of their guardians.

Aviva stadium impressive, great organisation getting fans in and out a credit to the authorities.

Overall a great weekend and the people of Dublin so friendly.",5,2011,08,29
202,"""Cozy and classy""","The Westin in Dublin is a great location and a great stay. Appreciated the choices in eating/drinking within the hotel, especially as I was there for business and not venturing out every night. Staff were friendly and polite and they did not forget my face as I was there for a week. Rooms were nicely sized and beds were super comfy. I appreciated their ""carbon footprint"" incentive to give 5 euros towards a beverage at the hotel if you opted to not have your room cleaned for a day. Great idea. Gym was small but clean with good selection of machines and weights.",5,2011,08,29
202,"""5 Star""  Says Who??","After a long trip from Cork Arriving at a so called ""5 Star hotel"" only to find no one is sight to park the car. we finally found someone and waited on line to check in.  After a LONG wait, finally got to the room to enter the bathroom and realize NO toilet paper.  none on a shelf , not in a cabinet, none in the room.  waited a good 15 minutes for some.    Than decided to shower and get ready for dinner.   Took out the iron and tried to press clothes only to find out the Iron leaks!!  All over the floor and all over my shirt on the ironing board and into my luggage!!  A call to the front dest again only to wait another 20 minutes. (I haven't called the front dest in a hotel in years),  2 problems in no time arriving  to this Hotel..  we finally got a new iron and made it to dinner to ask if they would take us now that we are late..  We wake up in the morning and try to check E mail....Not without a credit card!! a ""5 star"" Hotel that charges by the hour for WIFI    This was by far the worst Westin  I have ever been to and will never be back.  I don't want to bash much more there is no need   TRUST ME   there Has to be better places to stay in dublin that offer the convince of being close to things.",1,2011,08,28
202,We will definitely stay here again!,The Westin Dublin was in a fantastic location - walking distance to almost everything Dublin has to offer. The rooms were very spacious and the employees were so nice.,5,2011,08,27
202,A Fine Hotel,"Stayed in this hotel with my wife for one night while in Dublin and was very impressed. I dont know a lot about 5* hotels as have rarely stayed in one but managed to get a really good price from lastminuite.com as part of there hush hush deals for ‚Ç¨165 for the two of use. We arrived in our car and pulled up on the street infront of the hotel and handed my keys over and away it was taken. It did cost ‚Ç¨25 for the night but it would cost the same if you had to find parking and it avoided all that hassle.
Hotel is very lush and grand, plenty of yes sir no sir can I help you sir. We were offered the upgrade to the president suite for a cost of ‚Ç¨300 which we declined. The room overlooked the atrium on the inside of the building which was fine but no front of building room was available. The bed was fantastic and slept great. The step in shower was also top class and the room was very comfortable to be in. There is no late residents bar but room service was prompt and friendly and not to badly priced .One of the best things about this hotel is the loaction right in the center of the city, no taxis needed across the road from Trinity college & Temple bar and a couple of mins. from Grafton st. & O'connel st. We didnt have the breakfast as there was so much choice to eat at  your door step.All in all would recomend it if you can get it at the right price. 
The only thing I could complain at and it is only picking for something, is the ceiling in the Step in shower had mildue on it.",5,2011,08,26
202,Will not be back!!!!!,"5* - I don't think so!!!!!  Dreadful service!!!  Quite simply the longest check-in and check out process EVER!  Hotel is hugely under-staffed!  One elevator servicing all floors!  Breakfast was sooooooooooo average - no juice, water or sauces in sight - everything is 'policed' by the slowest staff in the world!  Could not even get a glass of water without first enquiring if it was possible and then waiting for 15 minutes whilst it was obtained!  But the icing on the cake .... has to be credit card payment for Wi-fi!!!  Seriously, in this day and age for a 5* hotel not to offer complimentary wi-fi service is a joke!   Whilst the Westin is perfectly located, there are much better value hotels in the area.  Will not be back!",3,2011,08,22
202,Perfect location,"Nice rooms, perfect location across from Trinity College and a short walk to just about everything else....don't miss the Palace Bar across the street",5,2011,08,21
202,"Comfortable hotel, great location","I thorougly enjoyed my 4 day stay at this convenient hotel. The room was spacious, the amenities were very good and the location was excellent. Restaurants were high quality, their specials were reasonable and spa treatments were available in addition to a small gym. I was disappointed that none of the staff were Irish, but they were reasonably efficient.",4,2011,08,20
202,Friendly Staff. Great location.,"We had a great 3 night stay at the Westin in Dublin the first week of August. The staff was very friendly and accommodating. Peter, the valet attendant outside the hotel, was very helpful. We took a day trip to Northern Ireland and he was very helpful with directions and recommendations. There were 6 of us so we had 3 rooms, all with ""single"" beds. The single beds were a little larger than most single beds and definitely very ""heavenly"" and up to full Westin standards. It seems that people experienced problems and were not happy with an internet charge but the major hotel chains charge for internet anyways, so that was not a surprise. Ireland is a very friendly and welcoming country, the most friendly and welcoming of any place I have ever visited, the Westin fits in with that nicely. 

The location to Temple Bar, Grafton Street, Trinity College, and O'Connell street were perfect. A great location and experience! We would definitely stay here again and recommend the hotel. There are many great restaurants and shops within walking distance.",4,2011,08,19
202,Good Hotel,"Nice hotel and in a great location.  Steps away from hundreds of pubs and restaurants. Rooms very tidy and well kepts.

Attention SPG Members: in spite of having Platinum status with Starwood and a frequent guest of this particular hotel, I rarely seem to get an upgraded room.  I'm not ""feeling the love"" when I check in.  

In spite of the above, it's still a good spot to stay.  I never eat in the restaurants so can't comment on the food.  The Mint bar in the basement is quiet during the week, but very busy Friday and Saturday evenings.

Bathrooms are very nice - separate shower and a full sized tub.  Lots of marble.

Front desk staff are friendly and helpful.  On one occasion I lost my passport while in Dublin.  The front desk staff were helpful in locating my embassy and coordinating with airport staff in attempting to locate the lost document.",4,2011,08,19
202,If location is all-important for you - There is nothing like the WESTIN,"If location is all-important for you - like it is for me - WESTIN wins hands down. I started off wanting to stay at the Westbury because of the great reviews on tripadvisor but couldn't get a booking because we are a couple with a child and expedia website wouldn't accept the booking for Westbury and Westin did and I am REALLY very happy it worked out this way. I think Westin is really in the middle of everything and especially it is across the road from the temple bar area which is where you want to be in the evening for your musical pub crawls. I later on saw where Westbury was located - off Grafton street which is ok during the day but then it is not as central a location as the Westin which is surrounded by all the delights of Dublin - Westin has the trinity college almost as their neigbour and you will be going there to see the book of Kells or you should and also the temple bar if you cross the road and also the museum just behind. Sorry to go on about the location but I dont want to walk more than I have to and it frustrates me a great deal that on trip advisor they do not have a special search criteria just for location.  
The plus points for Westin were also the HUGE size of the room - they dont make those kind of room sizes anymore and inspite of the third bed - we had ample space to move around - really really big room by any standards. I liked that too. 
I also liked the fact that my concierge was an Irish Dara - I really love meeting local staff and people with local accents - he was very helpful and as were all the staff. Their room service is quick and efficient and their internet works well but budget 15 euros extra per day if you need to access it. 
The look and fell of the hotel is comfortable and classy - loved their flower centre piece and beautiful wooden floors and would like to make a special mention of their bed quality - very comfortable. it does look a bit vieillot where they have carpeted areas. 
Their weak point would be their plumbing I guess. The shower just did not drain quickly enough and you sort of have sunken feet for a few minutes. but honestly that is a minor point. 
I would definitely ONLY choose the Westin again if I went back to the Dublin  and you should too because of the superb location. I also saw where the Hilton was - ouch - please.... 
After your musical pub crawl , believe me, you just want to get cross the road and roll into your bed and not go off all the way off  Grafton street  or wherever your hotel is located because Graftton street is dead anyway after 8 pm. Fleet street and Temple are the really happening places and that is where you want to be - Period. so Westin definitely was worth every penny - yeah euros. 
If you are planning a trip to Ireland and not just Dublin - please buy or borrow Rick Steeves guide to Ireland - superb tips on sight seeing and it is lively and chatty and opinionated and it will feel like a local is guiding you everywhere with tips and insight. Hope this was useful - Feel free to write if you wish to have further clarifications - also when in Dublin have meals at O Neils and Drewy Cafe on 78 Grafton Steet. Enjoy Dublin and the Westin.",4,2011,08,17
202,"Good, not great","The location and staff deserve high marks, but our appreciation was marred by some individually minor annoyances: a 15 Euro daily charge for wi-fi access, for example, for a not inexpensive room.  (Admittedly, the wi-fi worked fine for us, unlike on some other parts of our trip.)  There was a single plug available for recharging the various devices--phones, iPads, etc.--that we depend on, which was a real inconvenience.

Situated within a short walking distance of Temple Bar, Trinity College, Grafton Street and other destinations, this former bank building is a good base of operations for tourists like us.  We needed a rollaway bed for our daughter one night, and it was delivered and set up promptly--she found it more comfortable than the bed at her dormitory.  The room was fairly spacious, and the bathroom well-appointed with tub and separate shower.  We had one of the rooms facing in toward other rooms at the hotel--reduced light and privacy.

Overall, the shortcomings caused us annoyance and reduced our view of the value of this otherwise good hotel.",4,2011,08,15
202,Brilliant location,"We stayed here on a family vaction to Ireland prior to heading out the the country.  Perfect location for sight seeing.  just steps away from Trinity, Grafton Street and Temple Bar.  Easy pickup for the double decker tours of the city that take you to other sights like Guiness and Jameson.  The nightclub in the basemnet (Mint) was great for a grown up good time as an alternative to tthe much younger Temple Bar area.

Wonderful facilaty clean,  comfortable, nicely appointed rooms.  Truely exceeded expectations of a Westin based on my staying in many in the USA.",5,2011,08,13
202,"Wonderful experience, way too short!","We only stayed in Dublin one night on our way back from a week in Paris...  the hotel was great; the staff very helpful, attentive and friendly.  The hotel itself was beautifully updated, great Westin bed and updated bathrooms; we had a lovely view of the park and the square. 

The location was perfect, easy from the Airport via the shuttle bus and a walk to Temple Bar and the River.  Our only complaint was our stay was not long enough!",5,2011,08,12
202,Great central Dublin location and a good hotel,I was in Dublin for an event at Trinity College so I chose a hotel right next door.  I have lived in Dublin and very much enjoy Dublin 2 for nightlife and dining.  This hotel is very nice for a short or long stay.  I was there three nights and will stay there again the next time I am in Dublin.,4,2011,08,11
202,Nice Enough Westin but Noisy and Touristy Location!,"We stayed three nights. On the plus side - the staff were very friendly, the public rooms (renovated bank offices) are great looking,  the Westin ""Heavenly Bed"" is always comfortable, and we were able to walk to all of the main tourist attractions. On the down side - the streets around the Westin are mobbed and very noisy, and filled with young people imbibing the pleasures of the nearby pubs in Temple Bar!  When we checked in, the recepion warned us about the noise and advised us to take a room facing the small interior atrium, which we did - but it was a downer to have no natural light and to keep the curtain drawn so that people couldn't look in. And the room was very small, which the hotel says is a problem with many rooms since the building was a converted bank office and the rooms are awkwardly shaped.  We would not come back because the location is too zooey and touristy, and would prefer a quieter but central  area like the beautiful Merrion Hotel (where we stopped for lunch) in the Georgian neighborhood.  ",3,2011,08,10
202,Ideal city center location and exceptional staff,"My wife, her twin sister and I shared a room at this Westin hotel. After nearly three weeks of driving through the U.K. and Ireland, we were ready for some relaxing. Within moments of arriving with our rental car, there were people available offering help with luggage and parking, making our life a bit less stressful. We were given a room, though not large, but more than adequate for the three of us. The front desk staff, concierge desk staff and Peter, the doorman were all very friendly and more than willing to help. The location was ideal for exploring Dublin on foot and public transportation to anywhere was available just outside the main entrance. We enjoyed our five night stay here immensely and love to come back here again.",5,2011,08,09
202,Great location near Temple Bar area,"My wife and I stayed 2 nights at the Westin Dublin in early June 2011.  We really enjoyed Dublin and the hotel as well.  The hotel is right across the street from the road leading into the Temple Bar area.  So you have immediate access to that area but you are not staying directly there and have to deal with the crowds or noise late at night if you don't want to.  

The service was average during our stay.  No one was rude to us but only 1 or 2 of the folks at the lobby area were friendly and welcoming.

The bed was very nice as at most Westin hotels.  You could see that the building was older in certain areas of the room.  It wasn't bad but there would be small cracks here and there, especially in the bathroom.  We were surprised a little by this.  Overall though, our room was nice.  It was small but this seems to be the case everywhere in Europe.  If you are travelling with more than 3 people (4 or more), you will need 2+ rooms.

We did not eat at the hotel or go to the hotel bar as it was overpriced in our opinion.  There are better options just up the road in Temple Bar area.

We booked this hotel for `$130 on Hotwire and felt for that price, we got a good value.  We would definitely stay here again if it was available in that price range.",4,2011,08,04
202,Not as advertised,"Having booked two pre-paid rooms online at 214 euros per room per person, we were shocked on arrival to be shown into two grubby, run-down rooms with dirty carpets, old-fashioned furniture and old-fashioned and worn out fittings in the bathroom. One room had a kitchen moth on the ceiling and the other an exercise bicycle, which obstructed free movement in the room. Internet was not free and could only be obtained by paying an extra 15 euros per day. Breakfast was not included in the room rate. In our opinion, this was a three-star hotel claiming to be a five-star hotel. The pictures on the hotel website did not accurately represent the condition of the rooms. The rooms had an overall depressing feel and we decided not to stay.",1,2011,08,03
202,Would never return,"We just stayed at the Westin Dublin last night and we were very disappointed.  We reserved a king bed room and when we got there, it was a queen size.  When we called down to the front desk they alleged it was a king size bed.  They offered to upgrade us--- if we paid for it.  We declined.  

The hotel is located near the police (Garda) station.  Throughout the night, sirens went by our room and there were about 30 sirens.  It finally settled down around 4 a.m.  

Breakfast was mediocre.  The hallways were drab.  On every bill they automatically add a one euro donation to UNICEF.  The front desk said it was an optional charitable donation and they will remove it if a guest does not want to donate.  If it is optional, then why did they add it to my bill without my consent?  I  would never stay at the Westin Dublin again.",2,2011,07,31
202,"Very Disappointing experience, in spite of nice room","Although the room was nice enough and had a lovely view , the service was consistently very poor. Certainly not worthy of a 5 star rating, certainly not the customary service we have experienced at other Westin's. Staff attitudes ranged from haughty, to patronizing, to indifferent.  We maintained a courteous cheerful attitude during all interactions, optimistically hoping it would encourage a similar response.
       Our first clue was upon arrival:  there was no doorman or  valet available  - and it was not until we had already brought our luggage through the foyer, up the stairs into the lobby/reception area that the concierge  ""rushed""  from behind the reception counter to assist us the last foot or two of the distance. Once we were checked in, he actually asked if we wanted the bags delivered to our room, in a tone that said he would rather not be bothered helping us. 
     Everything was overall poorly organized - every morning (of the 3 nights we stayed there) we had to insist that we had prepaid for a full Irish breakfast and they announced they had to ""research"" this as we were not ""on the list"" and ""most certainly we were mistaken"".  Of course once they completed their ""research"" and discovered we were indeed supposed to be on ""the list"" for full breakfast,  they  did not apologize for being rude, and ill informed and insisting we were only ""entitled"" to continental breakfast.  
    On the 1st day, in spite of the fact that we left early morning with a sign on the door to have housekeeping service the room, we returned at 2:30 pm  to find the room had not been serviced. 
      We again had a disappointing experience upon check out when the concierge insisted we had used the telephone in the room to make calls, which we did not, we had used our cell phones for all calls. The concierge, who was ""in training"" was obviously annoyed at our insistence that we had not made any calls,  repeatedly questioning us and stating ""we were the only ones with keys to our room"". ( Hmmmm- doesn't hotel staff have keys to our room?)  In all of these situations we experienced embarrassment  - as if we would pay to stay at a 5 star hotel and then cheat them out of a  few sausages & eggs or a few Pounds  to make a telephone call. 
       During the entire  3 days, there was only one situation where experienced a staff member that seemed  interested in making our experience pleasant in a positive helpful manner.  
      We were visiting friends in Dublin, one of whom had over 20 years in the Hospitality industry, in many countries,  all at 5 star and Michelin starred establishments. He intervened  on our behalf the afternoon of our 2nd day, speaking directly with  Westin Dublin service management, requesting politely and professionally that they take the opportunity to provide a positive and memorable stay at the Westin:  the service did not improve.
   We will definitely not return to the Westin Dublin.",2,2011,07,31
202,Wonderful Hotel in a Great Location!,Everything about the Westin Dublin is first rate. I would strongly recommend this hotel to anyone traveling to Dublin. My pals and I were finishing up eleven days of golfing around Ireland.  We are/were all CEO's and sticklers for good service and first class accommodations. The Westin fit the bill in every respect. The location at the foot of the Temple Bar is tough to beat. Book the Westin and you will be glad that you did.,5,2011,07,30
202,"Very accomodating at Check-In, Great Location, Very Nice Bathroom and Room","We arrived in Ireland at 5 am Dublin time, not having slept all night. Even though check-in was not until the afternoon, they were able to check us in before 8 am, which we were so grateful for, as we were trying not to fall asleep in the lounge. Check-in was seamless, and they went out of their way for us. The hotel itself is in a great location, very close to the Temple Bar area with pubs and restuarants, and also near Trinity College. The hotel was beautiful, and the service was wonderful, with the exception of a very slow check-out. The gym is very nice and we used it each day. We had a great experience here!",4,2011,07,30
202,Better than home,"Beautiful hotel, fantastic location. Don't miss if you go in Dublin",5,2011,07,28
202,"Perfectly adequate, nice even","Stayed two nights last week while in Dublin for work.  The hotel is very centrally located, walking distance to just about everything I needed -- the office, the river, Grafton street, St Stephen's Green.  The gym is small but useful.  I didn't eat on-site so can't attest to restaurants but my first evening the hotel staff brought me two large complimentary bottles of still water and a very nice plate of fruit.  
My room (315) overlooked the atrium which gave good light and less noise than I imagine a room facing the street would have.  Bathroom had both tub and separate (very large) walk-in shower.  Two thumbs up, though a visible control for the extractor fan would have been useful.  Storage space for clothes was plentiful and the in-room safe large enough to hold my useless (so I thought) laptop.  Room had an ipod dock/alarm clock.
My only quibble is that I had access to free internet access through a corporate deal but wasn't told about it at check-in -- in fact the woman who checked me in specifically told me internet was NOT included.  I only found out at check-out, 48 hours too late...",4,2011,07,28
202,Location and history,"On our recent trip to Dublin (June 2011) , we were delighted with our hotel stay at the Westin. The location can't be beat: right across from Trinity College, a stone's throw from Grafton Street, and a short walk to Merrion Square and St. Stephen's Green. Nearly every Dublin sightsteeing stop is within walking distance of this hotel. The cab ride from the airport is very reasonable, only about 20 minutes and around 25 Euros. 

Perhaps the most charming aspect of the Westin Dublin is its history -- the hotel used to be a bank and has retained a lot of its historic charm. A visit to the Mint Bar brings guests to the old bank vaults, supplying interesting atmosphere (though the drinks themselves left a lot to be desired).

Rooms at the Westin Dublin are moderate in size, clean, and have modern furnishings, though the rooms retain their historic charm. There are framed etchings in each room, and pictures of the famous Georgian doors throughout the hotel hallways. Bathrooms are sizeable and feature lots of marble.

Service was warm and friendly, but would align more with 4 star expectations than what one might expect from other European 5 star hotels (i.e., the service was hospitable and gracious, but not highly personalized).

When in town, take the opportunity to dine at Chapter One and Pichet. If you fancy a pint, Stag's Head and Mulligan's both pour a good Guinness, have great service, and feature lively pub atmospheres. Near Merrion Square, The Cellar Bar (part of Merrion Hotel) has a decent wine list and a great historic atmosphere with its 18th century wine vaults. The people and parks of Dublin are really what make the city great, so take plenty of time to explore the green spaces and interact with the locals.",4,2011,07,27
202,Lovely hotel in a tourist-friendly part of town,"We visited Dublin for a couple of days prior to heading to the countryside for a friend's wedding.  We chose the Westin Dublin primarily because we had Starwood points and could use them for a free stay, but we would certainly stay there again.  The staff were all very friendly, and the location was perfect for tourists.  Easy walk to Grafton Street and St. Stephen's Green, right next to Trinity College where the Book of Kells is housed, and not a far walk to the Temple Bar area.   The bus stop for the airport shuttle (air coach)  is also located right across the street, so it's easy to get from the airport right to the hotel.

The decor was traditional, the room was adequate in size, and the bathroom was large by European standards.  The Heavenly Bed was wonderful, of course.  And there were fresh, fragrant flowers in the lobby.  

We enjoyed Dublin, especially the Guinness Storehouse, Trinity College (Book of Kells and the Long Room), Temple Bar, St. Stephen's Green and the National Leprechaun Museum (super cute folklore museum).",4,2011,07,27
202,Fantastic Hotel,"The Westin is located ina busy area of Dublin, close to nightlight, bars and clubs and plenty of great places to eat.  The staff were very helpful and check in was a breeze.  The rooms are excellent, very clean and very spacious.  Hotel is quiet which was great as we stayed at this hotel twice on our trip and the first night we checked in after a very long day and very late and needed a great night sleep. The hotel has a great fitness club but no SPG club lounge unfortunately.  Definitely recommend staying here.  

Getting to the airport was a breeze too with the Airlink bus stop just across the road from the hotel.",5,2011,07,27
202,nice place to start a trip,"Very central (across the street from Temple Bar, near the canal, Guiness, Grafton, St Stephens, St Patricks etc - all very walkable.) Good breakfast, very nice lounge atrium. They seemed to have trouble with the computers in the business center the day we were there, as there was a wait for use of the one computer available.
Accomodations were as expected. Service was good, and beds were comfortable.

I dont usually write about chain hotels, but this was a very nice spot to adjust to the timezone, prior to emarking on our tour of the country.",4,2011,07,26
202,Fantastic...Perfect...Delightful...I'm going back for sure...,"The Westin dublin is an excellent SPG Property and I am delighted to write a review...From the minute we checked in to the second we checked out, it was delightful..
We checked in very late on the 4th July night around 11:30 PM and the kids were exhausted after 2 flights DEL - LHR and LHR - DUB...Even at that hour, the hotel staff were very courteous and accommodating. the duty manager came out and welcomed us...smooth check in (not to forget the Westin Kids goodies)..We needed few things like help with Baby cribs, help with Feeding Bottles etc..They took care of it all.
Excellent Suite with a stone's throw view of the trinity college...
Nice sumptuous breakfasts, prompt in room dining with adequate variety..
A very aware and knowledgeable front office staff.
I've stayed at many westin properties globally. this was the best...
Dint get a chance to visit the Bar and Restaurants but then, I have to keep something unfinished to come back :)...
All in all, an excellent team working hand in glove is what I saw..great leadership,  percolating to the team level...I am going back again for sure..

KUDOS Team WESTIN DUBLIN.
Cheers.",5,2011,07,23
202,Excellent Location!  Highly Recommended!,"Excellent location & professional staff.
I highly recommend this hotel and will stay here again.  
The location is PERFECT...located on Westmoreland Street across from the Temple Bar area of Dublin, located close to Trinity College, and located on the ""hop on, hop off"" bus line.  The hotel is more expensive that other hotels in Dublin.  However, you get what you pay for.  If you are looking for palace-like accommodations, safety, an excellent location, professional staff, and want to be treated like royality, this is the place!",5,2011,07,23
202,The wonderful Westin will delight you,"The moment we stepped inside the grand Westin Dublin lobby, the distance traveled to get there melted away. The doorman and front desk staff where exceptionally attendant. 

Our room was ready 4 hours early and they had welcome beverages waiting in the lobby. We had requested a high floor and received a delightful corner room on the 5th (top floor) with roof top access. The bedroom was well decorated with crown molding and luxury linens complete with Westin‚Äôs signature Heavenly Bed (we were such fans that we own two such beds). French doors lead to marble bathroom with separate bathtub and shower. Take time to walk around the hotel and see the features of the banks that previously occupied this space. The ceiling murals, chandeliers, and ornate floor tiles are lovely.

Some of the hotel rooms encircle an indoor courtyard on the mezzanine level which serves as a lovely tea lounge. Tea is served until 6PM. You must try the mint chocolate, rich hot chocolate with mint flavoring topped with shipped cream. Breakfast is served buffet style or a la cart in the restaurant next to the entrance. The variety and quality were average. In celebration of our special occasion, we received a delightful note from the manager accompanied by a delicious piece of cheesecake and fruit during turndown.
Unfortunately, the Wi-Fi is 6 euro and hour. We used the business center for e-mail and boarding passes. The printers were both out of ink and it took over an hour on separate days to take care of our business. There was minimal assistance and the business center PC computers were unusually slow. The center did not charge for copies or printed pages despite the posted sign. 

Westin Dublin is perfectly located to visit Trinity College and Temple Bar. Cabs are readily available for transport outside the immediate area. We would definitely stay here again.",5,2011,07,19
202,Beware of taxis called by the doorman!,"We visited Dublin for our first time last week.  The location of the Westin was lovely, very close to Trinity College, Temple Bar, shopping on Grafton Street.  The hotel staff were very knowledgeable about Dublin events, restaurants, local sights and the public transportations system.  

Twice we asked the doorman to order a taxi for us.  Instead of using the first taxi in line he chose the taxi he wanted.  The first taxi driver put in the wrong code for calculating the fare to the train station.  I pointed out he was using an evening code and he corrected the code.  The second time we were going to the airport and again the doorman did not choose the first taxi in line.  This time the taxi driver doubled the price of the fare to the airport, when I asked why the fare was double he said fares were double on Sunday.  The taxi driver who took my sons to the airport 2 hours earlier did not double their fare.  When we went to pay the taxi driver at the airport he said we had to have the exact amount and would not wait  if I went to get change in the airport!  He took a very large tip as we were not prepared to pay with the exact change.   Always ask for the fare before you get in a Dublin taxi and do not use any taxi the Westin doorman recommends.",4,2011,07,18
202,"Great Location, Great Rooms, Great Hotel","Stayed at the Westin Dublin during a business trip. This was my first time staying at the Westin, not Dublin.  The location is perfect, across the street from Temple Bar...but without the noise.  Rooms are very spacious, clean and cozy.  The staff was friendly and made sure my stay was a pleasant one.  I didn't not eat at the hotel, but i did enjoy the Mint Bar downstairs which was great, has a bunch of beers on tap, mojito specials, etc.  This hotel will be my first choice when in Dublin.",5,2011,07,17
202,Convenient for tourists,"Excellent hotel location for exploring Dublin. The main attractions, except Guinness Storehouse, are in short walking distance from Westin Dublin. Also well located for good shopping in Grafton Street area. 
The hotel is near the action, but not inn the middle of the hustle and bustle. You can find peace and sleep well at Westin Dublin. 
Friendly staff and efficient service. 
Elegant rooms with very good lighting.
Easy access to the airport. Taxis always available outside the hotel. Aircoach stop across the street.",5,2011,07,17
202,Excellent...,"The Westin's location was excellent.  Central enough to go to the Temple Bar area, Stephens Green, Trinity College, etc.  The hotel staff were very helpful and friendly with directions and suggestions.  At check-in they asked if I wanted to upgrade to a luxury room.  I didn't take the option, but when we got to the room we couldn't figure what was not luxurious.  The bathroom was huge!!! with both a shower and a soaking tub.  The bed's were the best.  If this was their idea of standard, wish other hotels would pick it up.",5,2011,07,15
202,"Perfect location, friendly staff, charming room!","My husband and I spent 5 days in Dublin as part of a longer European trip. Our experience with the Westin began a month before we even went across the pond with an email to the concierge. Peter, one of the concierges, helped to answer my questions and then arranged a customized day with a driver to see the Cliffs of Moher. He was able to do something my hours of research (note there is nothing on tripadvisor for a private tour from Dublin to and from Cliffs) could not. The tour was one of the highlights of our trip and all thanks to Peter going over and above before he had even met us. Peter was a huge asset in Dublin as well. 
By the time my husband and I arrived it was late at night and at the end of a long trip. The Westin put huge smiles on both of our faces by treating us like gold. The hotel itself is literally across the Street from the Temple Bar area and Trinity College. Perfect location for walking all over Dublin. The room was large and very charming. Throughout our stay, the staff was overly accommodating. I can not imagine having stayed at a better located, nice, friendly hotel in Dublin. Thank you Westin, you really were amazing. (And a special shout out to Peter, he really is a huge asset to this hotel and was a huge part of our unforgettable trip!)",5,2011,07,14
202,The BEST Hotel Experience we've ever had!!!,"My wife and I stayed at the Westin for 10 days. The service was EXCEPTIONAL.During the course of our stay the hotel offered: great advice of Dublin, some of the best food we ate the entire trip (Exchange Restaurant), and some of the nicest staff. We truly felt at home while we were there! 
  The staff went out of their to make our anniversary special. They sent up champagne and strawberries, brownies, and deserts just to thank us over the course of our stay. 
   I can't recommend this Hotel enough! It is centrally located and the service is amazing!",5,2011,07,14
202,Westin splendor centrally located in Dublin,"Hotel was in a great location, walking distance to the grafton street shopping area, temple bar, and many other attractions.  Hotel staff was attentive and very helpful.  There is a small spa on the first floor with a single treatment room, the technician was extremely pleasant and the service was great.  The hotel had all of the amenities you would expect from a westin property.  

Tea service in the atrium was comfortable and not pretentious, with a wide selection of teas and snacks.  The bar downstairs is the gem of this hotel. Inventive cocktails, good selection of champagne and champagne cocktails, but most importantly very warm and friendly bar tenders.

This hotel appears to be very popular amongst US tourists and business travelers alike.",4,2011,07,14
202,Westin is no better than a 3 star hotel while paying for 5 star,"¬†Westin Hotel service is not great (3stars) yet you pay for 5 stars.¬†
Highly recommend Westbury Hotel instead in Dublin where the service is A1, you get free Wifi, shower caps, bathrobes for 2, Nespresso coffee machine, replenished twice daily. Clean towels twice daily if needed.¬†No mould in bathrooms.
Heated towel rail - great to dry washing.
Breakfast food and dinner restaurant superior to Westin.
Our group consisted of 38, single travelers had king beds, couples had queen beds. Wheelchair candidate requested walk in shower not bath , received bath tub with no shower. All could have been accommodated without problems had the employees done their jobs properly. Internet + Wifi costs were cheaper on my mobile roaming.",2,2011,07,13
202,Wonderful gem right in the centre of town,"We visited Dublin for the weekend and can recommend the Westin. From the outside is doesn't look much but the interior is beautiful.
The rooms are spacious and clean and there is excellent attention to detail - they have speakers for the TV in the bathroom and complimentary mineral water and even mouthwash!! 
If you want to be close to the beautiful College Green area of Dublin then this is the place to go. We walked everywhere very easily.
We also dined in their brassiere one night and were very impressed. If you get in early enough they do a great set menu on 2 or 3 courses and have a great wine and cocktail list. Book the Brasserie through Toptable for the best deal!",4,2011,07,12
202,Location can't be beat. Plus the Westin quality you'd expect.,"We've stayed at several hotels in Dublin over the years and, though the rooms are a bit small, the Westin Dublin is the PERFECT location. It's close enough to easily and safely walk home late at night from Temple Bar pubs (2 minute walk) and close enough to everything else during the day to avoid cabs or transit. Quality furnishings and bedding, nice bathrooms, all the normal Westin touches. Can be expensive some dates during the year, but they usually have good specials or packages on SPG.com for this location. (NOTE: If you are a space-hog and need extra room to spread out, consider an upgrade.) We are returning this month and have emailed a few special requests directly to the front desk who've been VERY accommodating and kind. Only thing that would make this hotel better would be a pool!",5,2011,07,12
202,"Awesome location, elegant comfort","The location of the hotel can't be beat: proximity to Temple Bar and Trinity College made it incredibly convenient to enjoy the city.  The hotel itself is elegant and comfortable. The only flaw is in the concierge service: gave us wrong/incomplete info about performance time for Irish dance at the Arlington Hotel (and booked a not-so-great table), and failed to follow up as promised when we inquired about a lost item.  For pure location and comfort of stay, however, it was fully satisfactory.",4,2011,07,10
202,The staff went out of their way to accomodate our every need.,"The room was extraordinary and perfect for our family of three.  Our spur of the moment birthday dinner in their restaurant was fantastic and accompanied by many birthday ""extras"" and lots of special attention.  All of the staff was beyond competent, welcoming, helpful and friendly.  Best place we've stayed in Dublin.",5,2011,07,07
202,Service was great!,"We booked our stay on Starwood points, which was very easy to do. We were fortunate that our room was available upon arrival after an overnight flight. We dined at the hotel as well and the food was excellent.",4,2011,07,06
202,1st class hotel in a great location,This was our first trip to Dublin and we loved this hotel.  It was easy to walk to the top attractions.  The service was excellent and our room was beautiful.,5,2011,07,05
202,"Great Hotel, super location, very comfortable","The Westing staff very helpful and accomodating, room  super and very comfortable bed. The location was perfect for all the local businesses and attrractions. Had a super ""Mint Bar"" beefburger, and the Gin and Tonic was perfectly prepared.",5,2011,07,04
202,Great Westin in a great location!,"The hotel is right next to Trinity college and a 2 minute walk to Temple Bar. Other attractions such as St. Patrick's Cathral and Duvlin Castle are within a 10-15 minute walk as well.

Rooms are nice and clean. The decorations are very nice and there's a great atrium for drinks or afternoon tea. Overall its a great hotel in Dublin!",4,2011,07,01
202,Front Desk personnel not professional,All Front Desk employees were in training.  No one knew how to answer simple questions or provide recommendation.,2,2011,06,30
202,Well worth a visit,We had a two night stay in Dublin and found the Westin to be an excellent choice.  Perfect location for walking around the city  The hotel itself was clean and comfortable. The bedroom and bathroom were a good size and the bed and pillows very comfortable.  There was a varied choice at breakfast and we found the staff very friendly.  A very comfortable stay and we would stay again on any return trips to Dublin.,5,2011,06,30
202,This hotel is in the perfect location for exploring Dublin.,"It is all about location, location, location. The hotel is next door to Trinity College, and the Book of Kells, down the street from the Temple Bar Area and many of the historic pubs and pub crawls. We were within walking distance of everything including the James Joyce Museum, the Guinness Tour, the Literary Pub Crawl,, shopping, etc.
I highly recommend the Trinitiy College Walking Tour, the Brazen Head Pub for music and Irish Folk Tales.
The hotel is small and blends into the local architecture. The rooms are pleasant and comfortable.",4,2011,06,29
202,Mediocre,"We stayed here three nights and the location was the best feature. The staff were okay...just barely polite and not overwhelmingly helpful. The room smelled of new paint and was strangely configured...as though nothing were really well-planned in a renovation. The plugs for certain things-coffee machine, hair dryer- only fit one random plug near the bed. The doors didn't seem to fit so that you had to slam them to get any thing closed. I've stayed at Westin hotels all over the world and this is the worst one thus far...doesn't have the usual comfort and friendly staff.",3,2011,06,26
202,Unbeatable Location,After an overnight flight from the US we arrived at the Westin about 8 in the morning. Our room was not ready yet - we did not expect it to be and wanted to just leave our luggage at the hotel. But the concierge was extremely nice and promised to have the room ready in an hour. So we waited on the second floor and after an hour the room was indeed ready and we were able to  go to our room and have a rest.  The room was spacious and the bed comfortable; the bathroom was huge with a tub and a shower. The hotel is within walking distance of many major Dublin attractions. We were able to do some sightseeing and return to have a rest when we got tired before heading out to the next destination. This made our visit to Dublin very enjoyable.,5,2011,06,25
202,Perfect location and great hotel,"The Westin Dublin is located within easy walking distance of OConnell Street and Grafton Street for great shopping and dining, Temple Bar for local pubs and directly across the street from Trinity College.  The location could not be any more convenient for exploring the city.  The hotel is beautifully decorated and features an atrium restaurant and bar.  The rooms are quite spacious with a large tub and separate shower in the bathroom.  As a travel consultant, I will recommend this hotel for all my travelers to Dublin.  I will definitely return to the Westin Dublin.",5,2011,06,23
202,Terribly overpriced,"Poor value fo rmoney. Hotel clean and staff friendly. Good food in Exhange restaurant. Ancient bathrom plumbing and mean supply of shower gel and shampoo for the price. Good situation in Temple Bar, but woudl not stay here again.",3,2011,06,22
202,Great location,"Hotel located near Trinity College---near Grafton St for shopping and Temple Bar for nightlife.

202,"Wonderful service, great location.","We recently stayed at the Westin Dublin (May 22 - May 27, 2011) and can't say enough positive things about our experience.  We had an overnight flight and arrived at the hotel very early in the morning.  We had some concern the hotel was booked solid and that we might not be able to get early check in, but not only did they have no problem accommodating our early arrival they gave us a complimentary upgrade to a suite because we were there for a family celebration (our daughter's first birthday).  The room was lovely with a multi-level layout, separate bedroom/living areas, and a large bathroom.  The exemplary service did not stop at check in either.  From the concierge's thoughtful recommendations, to the warm and friendly greetings, to the handwritten note from the General Manager, to the complimentary dessert tray for our daughter's birthday, the whole staff made us feel welcomed and special at every opportunity.  Additionally, the hotel is located in a prime location which made getting around incredibly easy and convenient.  We would highly recommend this hotel to our family and friends and the next time we come to Dublin we will be back.",5,2011,06,15
202,"Great location, nice hotel, mediocre service","We stayed here twice during our recent trip to Ireland.  Friday and Saturday night and then Thursday night.  We were allowed to check in early (7am) without an extra charge, but no one helped with our luggage even though there were a few people out front and the entrance had stairs to get to the reception desk.  The Standard room (Fri and Sat night) was extremely small.  We had trouble walking around the room once we opened our luggage.  In fairness, we did have 2 adults and 1 child in the Queen Standard room.  The Deluxe King room on Thursday night had much better space.  I do recommend the Mint Bar in the basement.  The building used to be a bank and the Mint Bar was the vault.  They even have some of the old lockboxes as part of the decor.  The hotel is charming and the location is great, but the service isn't as high as we expected.",4,2011,06,14
202,Excellent experience with Westin,"As a couple who live in Dublin, the Westin was a great destination for us to celebrate a birthday as we did not have the time to fly anywhere.  A treat of a couple of nights in one of the large suites of the Westin not only lived up to the reputation and expectations, but managed to exceed.

A great welcome, a surprise birthday treat sent to the room, excellent cocktails and Salsa night, and not to mention the Sunday Brunch - when they say unlimited champagne they mean it :o)

Great experience showing that there is plenty of hope in the Irish high end Tourist business... others should take note.",5,2011,06,14
202,Elegant Irish,"Smooth check-in, informative and freindly. Early check-in so I took whatever room was available rather than the upgrade that I was entitled to. Room was nice, clean, well furnished and bright. Staff very friendly and willing to help. Breakfast was good quality and environment friendly and welcoming in the restaurant. This is a hotel in an old building so no sweeping staircases or vast lobby but a good mix of old charm (small corridors, enclosed spaces) and modern service and quality. Location good for access to most attractions in Dublin, transport and restaurants and pubs. Tried the Spa, which is very small and wasn't that impressed but Dublin isn't the kind of place you go to relax! Good deal on Internet for 5 day stay.",4,2011,06,13
202,Best located hotel in heart of City,"I was thrilled that iIhad the opportunity to stay here - great service, spacious & clean bright rooms, amazing beds, fantastic bathroom with all amenities, a room safe & a secure hotel  (important for solo traveler).  The room price was really decent as well & well worth it.  Staff were extremely friendly and helpful.  This hotel was close to everything ! I only had 3 days to take in the city & was able to walk to all the attractions, Temple Bar,   2 mins.  to Trinity College,/Book of Kells -all the shopping districts  tour bus stops & hop-on-off etc. merely minutes away. No need for cabs to/from attractions and shopping as you are in the centre of everything (also saves you $$).  while there I saw other hotels I was considering when looking on-line & really glad I chose the Westin Dublin.  I will definitely return to this hotel !!",5,2011,06,13
202,A great stay....,"As a newlywed couple, my husband and I were looking for a convenient and comfortable hotel. The Westin met all of our expectations and then some!! Our flight arrived early in the day and the hotel made sure our room was ready for us. 

We booked our hotel room online and got a great deal because we booked early and paid in full.  The room was spaceous and very clean. We loved the location and the service. Everyone was very helpful and friendly. 

This hotel is within walking distance to St. Patrick's Cathedral, the Jameson Distillery, the Guinness Brewery, Grafton street, and temple bar. 

Be sure to visit the palace bar in Temple Bar across the street. Wonderful bar for new visitors and locals. We would recommend this hotel to all of our friends and family!",5,2011,06,13
202,Location great BUT,"Rooms,location and staff were great BUT the food was the poorest experinced in our Ireland holiday ordinary and not well presented . Establishment restaurant seems to open and close on the whim of management . Fortuanately the location made it easy to eat elsewhere. Breakfast limited and not very appetisingly presented Subway acroos the road would have been better",4,2011,06,11
202,Best stay in Dublin!,"This is a magnificent hotel that my husband and I highly recommend. It is centrally located to shopping, pubs, restaurants, anything you wish to do in Dublin. Easy access to public transportation too. Staff was very friendly and helpful. The general manager even had a signed card with a lovely dessert waiting in our room the first night we returned after dinner helping in our celebration of our anniversary! The room was beautiful with a nice view of Trinity College. Thank you Westin hotel and Staff.",5,2011,06,05
202,Great Location!,"You just couldn't ask for a better location in Dublin.  This 4-star hotel is right across the street from Trinity College/Book of Kells, only steps from Grafton Street, Temple Bar, the Liffey, O'Connell Street.  Our room had a view of Trinity College.  Nice big rooms, courteous staff.  Doesn't exactly have that ""Irish charm"", but we got plenty of that later in our trip.  Would recommend.",5,2011,06,01
202,Nice but nickel and diming hard to take.,"We booked the Westin because we've always liked the chain, they have a great location and most of the reviews on this site were good. In general, we'd agree. The rooms are large and comfortable, the location is prime and the staff is friendly and helpful. Only gripe is that virtually all services are added to the room rate, which is hefty already. Hard to understand why a hotel charging $400 a night can't roll internet and tv into the bill, but they don't here. They don't give you newspapers in the morning unless you pay extra either. The only thing that's free is the well-equipped fitness center, which we've enjoyed. We'd probably stay here again for the positives, but travelers should be aware that the sticker price may not be the amount they see when they check out.",4,2011,05,27
202,"Excellent customer service, friendly and accommodating staff, and a great location!","The Westin Dublin is an excellent place to stay.  For tourism, it is about one block to the information center and hop on/off bus tours.  It is within walking to wonderful shopping and excellent restaurants.  The conceirge gave several recommendations which were outstanding.   For business, it is relatively close to the new convention center.  The staff was exceedingly accommodating and very friendly.  They definitiely went out of their way to make the stay outstanding.",5,2011,05,23
202,A Relaxing Hotel in a Vibrant City.,Our short stay in Dublin was enhanced greatly by the superb location of the Westin.  This hotel compares favourably with Westin Hotels in the USA which in our experience have the very highest standards.  The service was friendly and unquestioning.  A totally relaxing  hotel in the heart of this wonderful City.,5,2011,05,13
202,"10/10 for location, service, luxury, bars, restaurants, staff etc.","If you stay in Dublin, this is the ONLY hotel you need look at.  DO NOT stay in temple bar, this is across the road from Temple Bar without the noise!! I stayed there with my 3 girlfriends, we are all in our late 30's and from Australia.  This hotel offered everything you need, luxurious bathrooms.  The beds, sheets and pillows make you want to take them home with you, dark curtains, sound proof windows, hairdryers, ironing boards all supplied.  The staff are so friendly, the mint bar downstairs has the best cocktails and is so lively and classy with salsa dancing as well as jazz bands.  The restaurant offers superfoods breakfasts, they have a business centre and a mezzanine level that does the must try chocolate menu sensation. We all used the hotel spa for massages and again, the service and experience was 10/10. I can not imagine even considering another hotel based on our experience at The Westin Dublin.  We all know what makes a good holiday is an outstanding hotel - you wont find better.  We booked staright through the hotels website - they offered the BEST rate, paid in advance and it was worth every penny and more.",5,2011,05,12
202,"Ideal Location, Beautiful Building","We traded in some Starwood points, and we were very happy with our stay. The staff members were very helpful when we had questions, and the property is really beautiful. 

We chose this place, however, for the location. Just a block up from Trinity, a block down from the O'Connell Bridge, and across the street from Temple Bar. We could catch a bus to just about anywhere (Dublin Castle, Kilmainham Gaol, Guinness Storehouse, etc.) on that street, too. Perfect!",4,2011,05,12
202,An elegant hotel in an ideal downtown Dublin location,"For a rewarding brief stay (2 nights) in a delightful and elegant building in Dublin, with attractive rooms and very attentive service everywhere, one probably couldn't surpass the Westin.  Across from Trinity College and down the street from superb shopping, near Temple Bar and very close to the Liffey and O'Connell Street, the location is exellent.   The hotel has a nice restaurant for breakfast and for dinner when you don't want to go out, and there's also a pbb-like bar and a mezzanine lounge for ""tea"" or whatever.  The staff is helpful in steering one to desired locations and making arrangements if requested.  It's a bit spendy but certainly comparable to other good hotels in the city price-wise, and one gets one's money's worth here.",5,2011,05,10
202,nice for the price,"brill location very clean ,nice staff [who speak good english] great reward scheme the only bad review would be in room243 the tiles on the bathroom floor are very uneven you would stub your toe[i did] the toilet is way to close to the wall and the loo roll holder was hitting my shoulder im sure all rooms are not like that ,would recommend.",4,2011,05,08
202,Hotel was great until my belongings were stolen,"My stay at this hotel was great until I discovered that my belongings were stolen. I contacted the hotel about this, and they basically told me that they don't guarantee anything that is not stored in their safe at the front desk or inside a closet.  They were basically non-responsive with my complaint until I contact the Starwood Corporation when I came back to the US, then they took me slightly more seriously. However, my issues were not resolved and approximately $1000 worth of my belongings were stolen by their staff, and they told me that they will do nothing for me and told me to contact the Dublin Police which I did.  I will not recommend nor return to this hotel again and I seriously question their policy in making sure their guest's belongings are safe.",1,2011,05,06
202,Amazing Service - what a fantastic hotel,"My husband and I stayed in this hotel last weekend and I can honestly say I have never experienced service like it. The staff were all excellent and nothing was a problem for them. As it was our anniversary we got upgraded to a deluxe city view room and when we arrived back to our room after shopping there was a plate left with cheesecake and chocolate dipped strawberries for us. 

This hotel is directly opposite the entrance to temple bar and so close to Grafton Street. Location was superb.

Our room was a great size and the bathroom was brilliant with a bath and a massive walk in shower separately. 

In the Atrium Lounge you get delicious scones with jam and clotted cream. It is so luxurious and the staff here were also really helpful. The bar was great with entertainment on both nights.

I loved this hotel and would say that it is the best hotel I have ever stayed in and I have stayed in loads of hotels as I have a little bit of an obsession with them. We go to Dublin once every 2 months and will definitely be going back to the Westin.

I would recommend this hotel to anyone.",5,2011,05,04
202,A first class hotel especially for business.  Definitely would stay again.,"I stayed here for 3 nights in early April with my colleague on a business trip.  We checked-in late on Sunday and received a very warm welcome from the check-in person who very kindly upgraded us to a Deluxe room which was very much appreciated.  Being a SPG member possibly played a part here.

The room was spacious, clean, tastefully decorated, quiet, and the bed was very comfortable to sleep in.  It usually takes me a day or so before I can sleep normally in a new hotel bed however I had no problems sleeping peacefully in this one.  Especially important when you are there for business.

Due to our late arrival on Sunday only the Mint Bar was able to cater for hot food which initially was a major negative point however the selection was pretty decent, pricing was reasonable (except for the large Coke which was more expensive than most places in London), but most importantly the staff were friendly, professional, and extremely efficient.  We had some interesting requests and the staff were willing to go out of their way to accommodate them.  We could not believe how quickly the food took to arrive, and this was not just a one-off, as we finished late every night so ended up eating there all 3 nights, all with the same result.

Check-out was a bit slow considering how efficient the rest of the service was but this was probably more due to the customer in front of us who seemed to have issues.  There were a couple of other staff around the reception area who did not appear to be serving anyone else so it was a bit of a shame that they did not offer to serve us especially since we were running late.  Nevertheless this did not really spoil what was an extemely nice stay at a beautiful hotel.

I would definitely stay here again.",5,2011,05,02
202,Elegant rooms; service ok; chargeable internet,"The Westin room was very elegant, with an incredibly comfortable armchair and bed as well as a truly beautiful bathroom.

The hotel's 'Atrium Lounge' is a nice spot, which serves really good quality teas - the bar has some interesting whiskeys!  For me though, the 'Atrium Lounge' can't compare with the sheer sleekness and elegance of 'The Gallery' at The Westbury Hotel where we stayed the previous two nights.

Other 5-star hotels I've used provided free in-room internet; The Westin charges. Smacks of profiteering when a 5-star place charges.

Service was just ok, though the Concierge was very good; helpful and friendly.

Exchange Restaurant nicely styled but food not outstanding.

Overall, I found The Westin Dublin just a little lacking in a number of areas compared to other 5-star places I've stayed.  Still a good hotel though, and I'd certainly stay there again given the right rate.",3,2011,05,01
202,"Absolutely fabulous hotel, service is second to none - highly recommended","The Westin is a top class hotel, with top class service to match. The rooms are always perfect and the decor is beautiful. I can honestly recommend this hotel without hesitation.",5,2011,04,30
202,Disappointing,"Having stayed in other Sheraton hotels before, we had high expectations when booking and arriving at the Westin Dublin. Unfortunately these expectations were not met - this is a good hotel, certainly deserving of 4-stars, but it does little to justify its status as a 5-star hotel.

Arriving on Bank Holiday Monday, which you would expect to be busy for hotels, we expected to be greeted by a doorman as you would at a 5-star hotel. No doorman was present, so we were forced to carry our bags up the steps that greet you at the entrance of the hotel. There is a ramp at the side through another door but we were not aware nor directed to this. 

The staff are friendly and the reception is smart, but as with so much of the hotel, there is nothing outstanding about it, nothing to differentiate it from any good 4-star hotels. 

We booked 2 rooms, and bizarrely one was significantly bigger than the other. Neither was much bigger than a room at a chain such as the Holiday Inn, and the decor was not anything special either. Another disappointing feature was the lack of complimentary toiletries in the bathroom - staying at a 5-star establishment one would expect a wide range of high quality toiletries. Disappointingly though all that wass offered are the bog-standard miniatures (just shower gel, shampoo and conditioner) you find in every other 3/4-star chain.

We did not take breakfast at the hotel as we often left early for sightseeing, but primarily due to the high price. 

Another disappointing feature was the lack of free wi-fi in the hotel. Surely customers should expect free internet access when paying a large sum to stay at the hotel?

If you are looking for that 'wow' factor and an exceptional hotel, I'm afraid you will have to look elsewhere. Overall, this is a good, well-located hotel, but it is certainly not excellent nor worthy of 5-stars.",3,2011,04,28
202,"Great Location, Pricey, Food Poisoning","My girlfriend and I stayed at the Westin Dublin at the beginning of April, the hotel itself is located in the most central, fantastic spot in the city.  It is within walking distance to virtually everything worth doing.  The hotel looks nice from the outside.  The lobby is very nice.  The staff were nice.  The room's are small and have a lot of road noise, I thought they were even a bit small by European standards, especially for a 5 star hotel that commands a 5 star price in every respect (Pricey food, pricey interenet, pricey movies, pricey everything).  On the 3rd night of our stay my girlfriend ordered room service and got violently ill from eating their apple pie.  I contacted the staff, they were concerned but in the end took no real responsibility for their kitchens screw up.  I won't be returning and am not sure if I'll be continuing my time as a loyal Starwood customer.  FYI for SPG members, I'm gold and you get nothing at this hotel for that level.",2,2011,04,28
202,A little expensive but great location,"This hotel is the average high end hotel. Everything is very nice and clean, the staff is very helpful and polite. The price is high for the area but because you are close to everything to see on a short trip to Dublin, the cost is balanced with the location. You are at walking distance from Templar bar area, Trinity college and the main shopping and bar scene streets. You are close to grocery stores and little restaurants. Also you are close to tourist information and bus departure areas.",4,2011,04,22
202,Great location with attentive staff,"The room was fine; typical Westin property....good beds, etc. which is important after a long flight.  It was the staff that made it most pleasant.  Everyone we encounterd was friendly and helpful; quick to offer suggestions and give directions.",5,2011,04,22
202,Rugby in Dublin,"My wife and I were in Dublin for the first weekend in April as part of a group travelling to support Leicester Tigers in the Heineken Cup. Tigers Events arranged, as usual, for accommodation at the Westin Hotel - with its superb central location giving easy & quick access to central Dublin on foot. Yet again the Westin gave us a stay to remember - from the warm welcome,  friendly front desk and concierge, excellent restaurant facilities and fun bar staff. Well run hotel with great staff.   Whats more its an easy 30-35 mins walk to the amazing new Lansdowne Road AVIVA stadium.  Definitely a hotel to be recommended.   The only downside was that one of our group had a handbag stolen from the hotel bar at the busy Salsa Party on Friday night .... but I understand that the hotel management were very helpful and the establishment is now tightening its security procedures.",5,2011,04,22
202,"Friendly, efficent, perfect location","Stayed in the Westin for one night over New Years Day. I had no problem arriving early in the morning for check in. Check in process was effortless and the receptionist nice and cheerful. Room wasnt huge but for one person it was perfect and the bed v comfortable indeed. My only gripe was the lack of a bathrobe or slippers, but this is a minor issue. 
Couldnt recommend this hotel enough, and have rebooked for a Easter stay",4,2011,04,18
202,"Love this hotel, great location, great service-perfect trip!","Hotel is beautiful, staff is very accomodating.  
Loved the huge atrium/bar area. 
Expensive breakfast, but very good with great service. 
Loved Dublin-perfect place the stay!  We could walk everywhere.

We stayed here the first 3 nights of our trip and the last night before flying home.  The first leg we were upgrading to a great 2 story suite with a spiral staircase.  It was a fun room, but sort of useless really because it was just a sitting area with no bathroom or anything, but fun to have the extra space in a hotel room.",5,2011,04,10
202,"Excellent Hotel, in Fantastic Location","Have just returned from an absolutely lovely stay at the Westin, we booked through Expedia.  It should be rated much higher in the reviews.  The Hotel is situated in the heart of Dublin and is close to everything, the area is vibrant and feels really safe.  The rooms are spacious and extremely comfortable with high quality furnishings, spotless clean etc. just  as you would expect in a 5*.  The Atrium Lounge has a feeling of opulence and relaxation.  Staff were very welcoming and nothing was too much trouble.  We ate in the Exchange Bar on the early bird offer, this available until 7.30pm. (that is 25 Euros  for a 3 course meal).  The meal was excellent value for money, high quality food and good portion sizes which we did'nt expect considering it was so competitively priced, set in a lovely relaxed informal atmosphere,  in fact the Restaurant was cheaper than some of the dingy restaurants elsewhere in the city, well worth eating there, and if you want a change we found another nice Restaurant around the corner.  This was called the Millstone on Dame Street, its only 5 minutes from the Hotel, turn left outside the Hotel.  Once again, do stay at the Westin, you won't be disappointed, it deserves its 5* - enjoy",5,2011,04,07
202,Excellent location and five star staff,"We arrived early and a room was not ready. The hotel upgraded our room to a suite.  They were so helpful with directions, very gracious any time we needed them. The food in the hotel was great, a bit pricey for breakfast though. The location was fantastic, around everything, Trinity College, bars, shopping, there is a grocery around the corner.Go to the Temple Bar, great place. Also try Lou Bourdock's Fish and Chips  (Bobby Flay recommended them-excellent).",5,2011,04,05
202,A Comfy Bed in a Fabulous Location!,"The Westin Dublin was a great base for my vacation in Dublin. I stayed for 7 nights in an upgraded room from March 21-28 (I used Starwood points, so the room was free - and I was very, very happy to use my points for this hotel and room!). When I arrived at 7 am on Monday morning, I was pleasantly surprised that I could check in and go to my room. A really nice way to start my vacation! The bed was comfortable, the room quiet, the staff very friendly and helpful. The public areas were always very clean, my room was very clean and the bathroom roomy and very functional. The Atrium lounge area is a quiet and comfy spot to sit and relax after a day touring the city. And you really can't beat the location ... I was able to walk to everything. There is a Luas station only about 2 blocks away and a DART station about 4 blocks away. I would most definitely stay here again!",5,2011,03,31
202,Dublin's Best Hotel,"This hotel was great! Located just across from the Tempe Bar area with great dining options. Walking distance to everything. Staff was so wonderful, we will return!",5,2011,03,29
202,Good Hotel - Better Location - Great Staff,"Wife and I arrived after all night plane travel and checked bags and ventured out into Dublin. The staff here are great, GM tried to get us into room early, accomodated us to clean up in bathroom and called me on my US cell phone to advise when our room was ready. All are very helpful throughout the stay and the hotel is right in the heart of Dublin. Great beds and furnishings.",4,2011,03,26
202,Centrally located,"The Westin is located close to just about everything, making travel by cab nearly unnecessary.  The hotel is nice, and the staff was very helpful.  The rooms were only average, and the bathrooms are in need of updating.  Given the location though, I would gladly stay here again.",4,2011,03,24
202,Excellent service,"Probably the best hotel in Dublin.  I stay here regularly as the hotel is central, furnished wonderfully, excellent gym for a hotel, but the service is usually very good and on this occasion it was so excellent that I am prompted to write a review.",5,2011,03,20
202,Quality tranquil hotel,"Dublin is busy at the best of times but The Westin provides a retreat from the nearby hustle and bustle of the city, particularly on a rugby weekend. Its not a huge hotel which makes it reasonably intimate and still has all the facilities, which are good. The staff are friendly and very helpful as we had a celiac in our party and nothing was too difficult. The Mint bar provided a good place to end the night and the location is great and its very easy to get around.",5,2011,03,20
202,When you have a perfect location and add this Westin--it's heavenly,"My husband had a business trip and I tagged along for an extended stay in this lovely hotel.  We prepaid the rooms, so the price was reasonable. The location is perfect: directly across the street from the Temple Bar district, next door to Trinity College, very strategically placed between two wonderful shopping districts. The decor is elegant...the building was an old bank building and the Westin has retained a lot of pieces from that life. The rooms are large and even though we were facing the main drag, it was very quiet. I used the Fitness Center each day and the Mint Bar each evening as a quiet place to read (and sip a Guinness). The concierge recommended several great restaurants...no bad meals! The staff was extremely friendly and are proud of their commitment to being a ""green hotel"".  We highly recommend this Westin.",5,2011,03,16
202,"Great location, very nice hotel","My husband and I stayed at the Westin in Dublin this past weekend for our anniversary. It was in an excellent location. Easy to get to and from the airport with the air coach bus service. Location is right between Grafton St and the Temple Bar area. We were able to walk everywhere we wanted to go. The rooms were very nice. We paid a bit extra for an outside view instead of an inside view of the mezzanine restaurant. 
Rooms were very comfortable, nice and clean. There were even speakers to hear the television in the bathroom as well as a separate tub and shower. The only drawback was that breakfast was not included but we found plenty of other places to eat very close to the hotel. I would highly recommend this hotel. ",5,2011,03,16
202,"Good location, some niggles","On arrival at the Westin we were asked if we wanted to upgrade our room at extra cost.  We said we would and were told we could have 'the library room' (I think it was called).  When we got to the room, the actual sleeping area was quite small and there was a spiral staircase - quite high - up to a sitting area, it was very dark.  We decided that it was not worth paying the extra as we would be unlikely to use the sitting area.  So returned to reception and requested the original standard room.  This was very claustrophobic with a non opening window looking over the guests lounge/bar area. So from the room you could not see outside, so no way of knowing what the weather was doing.  The air conditioning did not seem to be able to cope with cooling the room and the room was very narrow.  It  a standard  double bed and the bedside tables were wedged against the walls, the ceiling was low, it felt like a cell.  So back my husband went and agreed to pay extra for a suite on the fifth floor.  This at least was brighter and more spacious, though quite cold as the heating did not seem to cope with heating the large space.  The room was generally clean enough and the bathroom was nice.  However, my gripes were that even though a hairdryer was provided there was nowhere, where it could be plugged in near to a mirror.  The light switches were dirty as were the switches and sockets in the bathroom and the pedal bin would not open unless prized open by hand. There was a  missing champagne glass in the cupboard, we stayed two nights used other glasses but still the champagne glass was not replaced.  The bed was extremely comfortable and it was very quiet for a city centre hotel.  We did not eat at the Westin, as the breakfast was expensive we preferred to breakfast at Bewey's in Grafton Street.  We have never before checked into a hotel and then asked to change rooms, this was a first for us.",3,2011,03,15
202,"perfect location, nice hotel","This hotel is in the most perfect location in Dublin. It is right across the street from Temple Bar, about a two minute walk to Trinity College, about two minutes to O'connel Street, and so close to many of the great dining options in downtown Dublin. The hotel really is about as most central of a spot you could find. The rooms are very traditionally decorated, and overall the hotel is very nice. The only real drawback to this hotel is the room doors are very heavy, which means if you want to sleep in in the morning it probably won't happen, mainly because as soon as housekeeping starts they are constantly opening and closing every door, making your whole room shake and sound like someone is slamming doors in your face. but it is a great hotel, in a great location otherwise.",4,2011,03,14
202,"Great Stay, Fantastic Staff","Sorry it took so long to review this but we stayed in December and January.

Our stay was great, fantastic buzz about the place, Mint Bar was busy and had a great atmosphere. Gillian in the bar was great, and Magda on reception. Rooms were comfortable, and they accommodated me (as a smoker) with a balcony. Only gripe I had was that the Westin Mattress are a little too soft for my taking, I'd prefer the Sweet Sleeper mattresses as they are a little more firm.

I must commend the staff here, they are excellent and they really made the stay. I'll definitely be back.",5,2011,03,04
202,"great hotel, even better location",located literally two blocks from temple bar area (all the nightlife) but far enough to be quiet. Walking distance from everything in a great area. Was on a two week backpacking trip through europe and this was our favorite place to stay. Wish we had extended to stay another evening!,5,2011,03,03
202,Disappointing,"I's forgotten why I'd stopped staying here, but the Merrion was full so had no choice. Was given 5th floor suite. But every hour or so, loud noise erupts from the roof. Reception - when I could find someone English-speaking - seemed surprised. Yet concierge who showed me to replacement room seemed au fait with the problem: the air-conditioning unit. New room - as with all others I've stayed in here - overlooked the street. Was woken up by foist guests in corridoor, and street-cleaning lorry at 4am. 

Gym is nice, and staff are friendly. But this hotel is a major disappointment, especially compared with other Weatins eg Sydney, Rome, Madrid.",3,2011,02,28
202,Nice hotel,"I'd certainly recommend this hotel to someone who goes to Dublin. this is located in the city center, has a historic feel to it, great staff and service and free breakfast. The hotel feels like a historic site from the outside, but is well done and maintained inside.",4,2011,02,25
202,A great place to stay!!,"Took my girlfriend to Dublin for her birthday and decided to stay at The Westin.  Didn't know exactly what to expect as there are some bad reviews but after staying there myself I can't understand why anyone would be negative about this hotel.  It is in the perfect location with Grafton Street a couple of minutes walk off to your left, and Temple Bar and O'Connel Street a couple of minutes to your right.  The concierge is luxurious and provides a real welcoming start to your stay.  We stayed in a standard room and this was more than adequate... room was large enough for the two of us, bathroom was really big and spacious with a nice deep bath and marble tiling as well as a very pleasant shower... and the bed, oh yes the bed!  If I had a couple of grand lying about spare I would most certainly consider buying the bed... it was an amazingly comfortable sleep, one which I would definately want to experience again.  We thought that our bed at home was comfortable however it now seems like we are sleeping on the floor of a cave in comparison.  The staff were very friendly and helpful as well and in fact, when we were down in the mint bar (which is in the basement of the hotel and used to be the old bank vaults) on my Girlfriends birthday the bar staff brought out a lovely piece of cheesecake with the words 'happy birthday' written in chocolate on the plate.  The Atrium is lovely as well... especially handy if it is raining outside, as it sort of feels like you are sat in some kind of Mediterranean courtyard while at the same time having all the comforts of your own sitting room.  I would definitely recommend this hotel... if you want comfort, great service and an excellent location then this is definitely the place to stay.",5,2011,02,21
202,relaxing and pleasant,"a big thank you to all the staff for making my trip a peaceful, delightful one. my whole experience was top class from the reception to the restaurant to the bar. amazing. top star hotel, i love the decor in the restaurant and the cocktail bar, there was a particular girl in the restaurant, really nice and helpful, beautiful smile and shows lot of passion and dedication to her job, a must keep waitress, cant remember her name, but she said she was from Nigeria i believe. 
overall my experience was fantastic.",5,2011,02,16
202,pleasure,"I booked the Westin hotel in Dublin for my wifes big birthday  cant say which one but its between 39 & 41.
We arrived around 130 pm and when we got to reception we where pleasently surprised by  the reception very nice indeed.
We checked in and where told for a small fee we could be upgraded to the presidental suite as it was free and as I said this was my wifes 40 th .
The room was unreal  it had its own gym sauna jacuzzi library and so on.
I cant thank the hotel staff enough.
Location is fab directly opposite temple bar two min walk to Grafton st and O Connell st.
The hotel has a cool bar which is a converted bank vault and there was a great atmosphere late into the night.
I have stayed in Dublin on many occassions and would say the Westin is as good as it gets.",5,2011,02,11
202,Fantastic Hotel,Stayed here for two nights for my wifes Birthday.  Booked this hotel over the phone with what must be a separate booking system which was not in the hotel. The girl could not even give me directions to the hotel !!! But after a few wrong turns made it :-) The hotels location is perfect. walking distance to great shopping and walking distance to many restaurants and bars. The atrium bar is fantastic - although a little expensive but thats Dublin Prices. I brought a lovely bottle of Dom Perignon with us to drink in the room and found that it cost over 350 in this hotel !!! 150 in good off licence. But I could not fault the hotel at all - breakfast was fantastic and room was perfect.,4,2011,02,07
202,Got to be one of the best in Dublin,"As William Dillard famously once said ''location location location''
this hotel is slap bang in the middle of Temple Bar. 5 mins walk to a number of shopping centres, famous bars of Temple and Capel St.
The rooms are tasteful well stocked and one of the biggest bathrooms I‚Äôve seen. 
The staff are friendly and have good local knowledge however like most of Dublin not native Irish so sometime a little hard to communicate with.
The only complaints are the ""heaven beds"" are way, way too soft your head is lower than your feet, fine if your pregnant or have poor blood circulation, a nightmare if you used to not sleeping on a bag of jelly!!  Also the internet is slightly over priced at 30 Euros a day (12pm-12pm) considering its extremely slow (like dial-up) and many sites blocked including my companies by what must be an overzealous catholic engineer (I work for betting company btw).
Make sure you include breakfast in the price of hotel like others on here have suggested otherwise its 20euros for what, is really, some bread and jam. if you have already booked without breakfast may I suggest across the road down temple bar rd ""Elephant and Castle""  great choices and half the price of the hotel.
These are just a couple of personal niggles though, you pay the price and receive a hotel that delivers everything a hotel in this class should.",5,2011,02,01
202,Lovely hotel in the heart of Dublin.,"Great choice for a stay in Dublin.  You can't beat the location - steps from Grafton Street, St. Stephen's Green, and Trinity College.  Our room was comfortable and fairly large for a city hotel.  The staff was helpful and courteous.  We really enjoyed our stay!",5,2011,01,31
202,Great Location,The Westin's main feature is the location. We saved a lot of money and time staying here as we were able to walk almost everywhere throughout the city. The rooms are comfortable and clean. Nothing to complain about! Breakfast was good (we did not eat any other meals here). Temple Bar is the place to grab lunch and dinner which is very close. We really enjoyed a musical pub crawl from Golightly's pub. We also enjoyed the hop on hop off tour. Trinity College is a must see but go first thing in the morning.,4,2011,01,27
202,One of my favourite Westin's in the world,"Stayed here on business in November. As hotels go, this is one of my favourite Westin properties. A converted bank HQ, it melds a grand style with the modern conveniences which Westin is well known for. My room was upgraded as an SPG Gold, and was comfortably appointed. Dinner in the restaurant was most enjoyable - though the wine list is a bit pricey.",5,2011,01,27
202,Very Comfortable,"This hotel use to be a large old bank building which has been converted into the Westin. It is in the central part of Dublin in a great location opposite the trendy Fleet Street and Temple Bar amd also in walking distance to the two main shopping streets of Grafton and Henry.

The hotel has a lot of character remaining from the bank days and The Mint Bar in the basement is a load of fun. If you have a chance check out what use to the the main customer area of the bank which is now the ballroom with its ornate decorations and chandeliers - exquisite.

The bedrooms are a good size and the bathrooms are large with seperate shower.

The only negative is that the breakfast selection is not great and the service in the dining room is pretty poor. But overall a really good hotel - and the Irish are lots of fun and know how to have a good time!",4,2011,01,22
202,"Nice stay, excellent location","My teenage daughter and I stayed at The Westin Dublin from 12/26-31 for vacation.  This property is located in an excellent, central location in downtown Dublin.  The staff was very friendly and helpful.  We had breakfast each morning at The Atrium restaurant, which was lovely and the food very good.  The staff at the restaurant were very pleasant, but the service was oddly slow despite being almost empty...if you're in a hurry, this might be a problem, but I enjoyed sipping coffee and reading the newspaper, so it was okay for me.  My only complaint was the bed.  The mattress was worn and uncomfortable.  I've never encountered a bad bed at a Westin, so maybe I just got unlucky on an old mattress nearing replacement.  Also, the room looked a bit worn, but fairly typical of what one sees in European hotels....nothing drastic though.  

Overall, we had a very nice stay, and I'd feel comfortable recommending The Westin Dublin to friends or family, and I'll likely return.",4,2011,01,21
202,"Central Location, Fantastic Staff, Outstanding Value","Gem of a hotel!  Central location near all major attractions in Dublin.  Celebrated New Years Eve in Dublin and I could not have picked a better hotel.  Staff is well trained and very attentive. The Concierge, Ivars, was top shelf and went far beyond my expectations for a 4 star hotel. Check in and checkout was quick, seamless with no hassles - very rare for a European Hotel.

Obvious that this is a well run Hotel. The Hotel GM actually reads and responds to the reviews on Trip Advisor - that's rare and shows he actually listens and responds to his customers.  I am a SPG Platinum so I got an upgrade to a Suite. I travel globally to China, Europe, India, South America - This Hotel is now among my very top favorites and we will return again soon.  

 Only criticism is the hotel restaurant/mini bar prices are slightly high, but not out of line for a City Center European Hotel.   Also, there is no Platinum Club Lounge. With all of the wonderful pubs and restaurants nearby this is a non-issue.

Book well ahead for popular dates; let the staff know of any preferences or special needs. This team goes far beyond expectations to please.",5,2011,01,04
202,Excellent Hotel in a convenient location,"Typical of your big city Westin hotels.  The Front desk staff, Concierge, and bell stand staff were very helpful, courteous, and friendly.  The room was also very nice and well kept.  There was a separate shower and bathtub.  The room was ‚Äúsmallish‚Äù, but nonetheless very nice and well kept.  We ate breakfast in the restaurant, and the service was poor.  Its obvious they mostly serve the buffet In the morning.  Otherwise a nice stay.  We stayed on points, so the rack rate is like 500+Euro.  Although I don‚Äôt know what a hotel in the tourist area of Dublin costs I wouldn‚Äôt pay that much for this room.  Check out staying maybe a little drive from the action for MUCH better prices.",4,2011,01,03
202,Home in the city,"We returned to the westin en route to a family christmas in ireland and were welcomed as though it was our city townhouse.  We are spy gold members which always ensures a great welcome here and a room with a good view.  Rooms are generally modest in size, however the spg preferred 4th floor makes up for the size with enchanting city views.  Our room had slight bay which allowed us to see everything from trinity college right up O'connell street (417).

Although westin are quite american and corporate, the staff here manage to make it feel classically irish; friendly, professional and efficient, without being pompous.  our car disappeared with the valet and was waiting for us on check out without the usual concierge hanging around for tips in both directions.

Great hotel, the best location in dublin!",5,2011,01,02
202,Fantastic Location and Large Rooms,"We booked the Westin Hotel very last minute to stay for new year and got a great deal of ¬£118 per night, through lastminute.com. When we arrived at the Hotel the friendly bellhop took our  luggage through to reception. Check-in was quick and we received an upgrade to a Deluxe Twin room.

Our Deluxe Twin room was very spacious as was the bathroom. The room has a large wardrobe with plenty of hangers, complete with Iron and Ironing Board. The room also has a smaller wardrobe with 3 large drawers and a safe. Another bonus was having three full length mirrors in the room, 

The Bathroom was really large with a separate shower which was powerful and a large bath. The style was classic and was a change instead of the cream marble you get everywhere else. One feature that stood out was the French doors to enter the bathroom.The toiletries where Westins own brand but had I been paying the full ¬£199 per night I would have expected a better selection and brand. Another thing lacking was the room did not have bath slippers, seen as the bathroom is full marble it was very easy to slip. The room also had two bathrobes.

The bedroom was lovely and had two large twin beds a desk and a cabinet with the mini bar in. The mattress was extremely comfortable and you sunk into it although I found the pillows to be slightly uncomfortable although I find this in most hotels,(I should bring my own).  The mini-bar had plenty off drinks although there was an awful smell of horse manure for some reason, we didn't complain, as it probably saved us money not using it :). The view out the window was not the best just an office block and a street, this made the room a bit dark seen as it did not have any ceiling lights. Although not the hotels fault when looking out the window we saw people urinating on the office blocks across the road which was really not a nice sight when staying in a 5 star hotel.

We visited the Atrium Lounge for a pot of tea which was brilliant. It was  served lovely with a selection of biscuits and the staff were very friendly. It was very cosy in their and comfortable to relax by the fire.

We booked Dinner in the Mint Bar and really enjoyed it. The Sirloin steak was great value for money at around 20 Euro and tasted excellent. A meal for two with 1 glass of wine,soda water,2 cokes and two sirloin steaks costed 53 Euro which we thought was good value considering it was Dublin.

We were quite dissapointed not with the Hotel but with the New Years Eve celebrations in Dublin. We thought that there would be some kind of Fireworks Display but when asking the concierge she told us there wasn't any. 

The Hotel is in an Excellent location for O'Connol street and Grafton Street  both about 5 minutes each way from the Westin. 

To finish our stay we had Breakfast in the Exchange restaurant which was reasonable at 19 Euro for a Full Irish. There was a great selection of hot and cold food, breakfast cereals,smoothies and fresh bagels and bread. The service was great and our waiter was fantastic. The breakfast at the Westin is 1000x better than the Westbury,

We will definitely return to the Westin but not Dublin for New Years Eve.",4,2011,01,02
202,great beds,"Stayed for one night which I booked through last minute.ie and did not know what hotel. Very happy with choice.  Rooms are nice, beds are great so comfortable. Staff were all lovely, from the receptionists to the guys in the mint bar. Location is great.",4,2011,01,01
202,Fab Hotel..great location and the comfiest beds.,"Visited Dublin for the first time for my partners ""big"" birthday. Reviewed TA for a recommendation and founfd the Westin, and glad that I did.
Firstly the location was brilliant. Only 5-8 mins walk from Grafton Street, Temple Bar and numerous restaurants and about 10 mins from O'Connell St. The airport bus drops off just outside Trinity College (on opposite side of junction) and picks up for on the other side of the street, so really handy.
There were 3 of us, me, my partner and 17 year old daughter. I booked a flight/hotel package so was unsure if I'd have to pay extra for the additional bed in our room - i didn't. A bonus though, it was a full sized single exactly the same as our beds. If I hadn't been on a tight schedule, I probably would have stayed in bed all weekend. It was probably the comfiest bed I have ever slept in. The room was very spacious, with a seperate wardrobe area, lovely large bathroom with bath and shower, free safe, plasma TV and a mini bar.Even though we were on the main road, there was very little, if no, road noise. 
Due to poor planning and lack of Saturday night restaurant booking, we ate in the Mint bar at short notice and the food was really good. 
One word of warning, Dublin is really expensive, but then I guess that's due to the economic climate there and low pound to euro exchange rate.
I would certainly go back to the Westin and hope to, in the very near future.",4,2010,12,14
202,"Stunning, Special, & Thoroughly Enjoyed.......","My friend Teresa & I had travelled from England to stay in Dublin for 2 nights, and  arrived at the hotel at  10.30am.  The reception staff were very helpful and instantly we were given a room upgrade and access to our room which was fantastic as check in is normally 3pm and within minutes the concierge had carried our luggage up to our room and we were in and settled by 11.30am, with bags unpacked and ready to start our mini break of shopping and relaxation......, so a big thank you to the all the staff  as we found them to be most pleasant and helpful with ideas on where to go to dine, drink and places to see.  We had coffee's, cocktails in the Atrium Bar, which is beautifully decorated with the most gorgeous comfortable furnishings, with the added touch of lushous Christmas trimmings and decorations draping from antique tables around the hotel.  The night door man was very chatty and full of common knowledge of Dublin in general.  This is the second time we have visited Dublin this year and we will be staying here at The Westin Hotel again next year as it's location is in a prime spot and cannot be beaten as it is the centre and surrounded by so many attractions, and lovely shops and restaurants.  One restaurant in particular called Shanahans on the Green....We went there on the evening of  Friday 10th Dec, The Oval Bar downstairs was perfect for pre dinner champers, and our meal was out of this world, lots of food, so too much to finish and the service was 5* class served by very experienced staff and with a smile.......a truly beautiful evening out..  So Thank You for all for making our stay with you a truly wonderful experience......oh, and The Mint Bar......in the basement....don't miss it.......great place",5,2010,12,14
202,Loved the location and style of this hotel,"I needed airline miles to keep my silver status so, on a whim, I flew round trip from Philadelphia to Dublin in December 2010. I'd never traveled to Europe before, so I did not know what to expect. I selected the Westin Dublin because it is a familiar brand hotel to me. I was not disappointed at all. In fact, I would rank the Westin Dublin up with any of the quality hotels in the United States. My room was clean and comfortable. It was quiet and felt very safe. The location is right in the middle of everything. Go one way and it's Temple Bar; go another way and it's Grafton Street shopping and the parks (greens); go another way it's Guinness Storehouse; go another way and it's the downtown area. The staff members were courteous and kind. I will be planning a return trip to the Westin Dublin in the near future. Loved it.",5,2010,12,10
202,The Westin Dublin was charming!,"The Westin Dublin is in the perfect location!  Close to the shopping district, a two minute walk to Trinity College, the Temple Bar area and convenient to the Hop on-Hop off bus stops.  We took that bus from the airport to the hotel since there is no hotel shuttle service.  We got the 3 day Freedom Ticket for only 26 euros (adults) right at the airport information desk; well worth it.  We not only had our transportation to and from the airport, we were able to tour the city, including a must see, the Guinness Factory Tour and with our bus pass, we received a discount on our admission fee.  Even though it snowed the entire time, the warm fireplaces in the lobby and my Heavenly Bed was toasty and comfortable--the rooms were spotless and the bathroom, a beautiful marble tub with a separate shower.  I would highly recommend this hotel.  Since I used my Starwood Points, I'm not sure about the value, but the Deluxe Rooms are definitely worth 10,000 points/night.",5,2010,12,09
202,Not 5 Star,"We booked through lastminute.com so I wasn't expecting one of the top rooms but our room was tiny and so hot it was uncomfortable just to be in it.  There were a few nice things, the bathroom was lovely and it was nice to have a coffee maker but those things were overshadowed by the fact that the room didn't have windows onto the street but rather into a lounge area.  Added to that, the windows didn't even open which made the hot, airlessness even worse.  We had the air conditioner on blasting at the lowest temperature all night long and even in the morning it was still stifling plus we were so dehydrated from the A.C, that we were like leather husks!  Really horrible experience and I'm so angry because we could have paid the same money for 100 other hotels in the area and I'm positive that none would have been worse.  I dont think a hotel can call itself 5-star as long as it is selling rooms like this one.",1,2010,12,07
202,Absolutely Horrendous Experience,"The overall, staff, management, and individuals that run this hotel are particularly, rude, obnoxious and pretentious as is the air in most of Dublin. However, at this particular hotel, I was treated with absolute disrespect by the management while even being a Starwood Platinum Preferred Guest. I was nearly assaulted by the night time security manager, cursed at, and shunned by the staff and general evening manager of the hotel. 

If you're planning a visit to Dublin my recommendation (with over 180 stays of hotels per year on average the last three years) would be to stay clear of this hotel.",1,2010,11,30
202,Very good hotel - very central,"Stayed here for second time. Spacious rooms, Excellent food. Friendly staff. Reception a bit slow both on check-in and out. Very centrally located 3 minutes from O'Connell St, Temple Bar and Grafton Street.",4,2010,11,24
202,Reception staff ruined our stay here.  Definitely not up 4 or 5 star standard.,"Myself and my friend arrived on Saturday lunchtime to check in.  We had been looking forward to this night away together for months, and as mothers of very young children the thoughts of an uninterrupted nights sleep in a fabulous hotel had us fizzing with excitement.  When we arrived at reception and gave our details to the receptionist we were informed that there were no twin rooms available and only doubles left.  I had rang the hotel twice to confirm my booking in the run up to our stay and on both times my request for twin room with twin beds was confirmed and yet here we were being told this was not possible.  When we argued our case she told us that the best they could offer us was a pull out bed, we were paying ‚Ç¨200 a night to stay in this hotel and she offered us a pull out bed, as you can imagine we were open mouthed with disbelief.  We requested to see a manager and so the receptionist disappeared to a back room for 10 mins, returning alone to tell us that surprise surprise they had found a twin room for us, and out of the goodness of their hearts they were giving this to us, excuse me for a moment, but were we not paying good money for this room, which i had confirmed on the phone to be a twin on two occasions??  We felt we were shown a complete lack of respect as customers and as people, and it was completely unprofessional to deal with customers in this way.  Our room was standard enough, not that amazing.  There was one tiny bottle of shower gel, shampoo & conditioner of hotel variety, no nice branded products here, and heaven forbid you want to shower twice during your stay, towels were very used and threadbare.  There was two tiny capsules of milk and two tea bags.  We ordered drinks from the bar on roomservice while we were getting ready to go out for dinner, after an hour of waiting we had to cancel and were told other requests had come in AFTER ours and so we were in a queue. The mind boggles.  Overall what should have been a fantastic stay was very very very average and definitely not worth the hefty price tag.  On the upside location is excellent and the doorman was lovely and extremely helpful but somebody needs to send their receptionist on a hospitality course, Ireland is after all suppose to be the land of ""a hundred thousand welcomes""...not in the Westin.",3,2010,11,22
202,Right next to Temple Bar,"Stayed here with my husband and our friends for two nights.  The location was ideal being right next to Temple Bar, literally not even a block away.  Our room faced the busy street, but you couldn't hear anything while being able to people watch and see the hustle and bustle of Dublin.  I was thoroughly impressed with the size of the room.  It was huge!  The bathroom could have been a room of it's own.  Loved that the sound system was throughout the suite as well.  The only complaint was the internet connection.  They charged for each different device being used, which racks up quickly as the connection fee is pricey.  However, when asked about this at the front desk we were told they work with an outside provider so there really isn't any flexibility.  Overall, great location.  The prices are more affordable if you can get the low season deals.  Would definitely stay here again simply for the convenience of location and comfortability of the rooms.  Also, the staff was very friendly and gave great suggestions for local eateries.",4,2010,11,19
202,"Great service, perfect location","We had a great stay for our anniversary. We were upgraded to a suite for a reasonable fee. Adrian from the concierge desk gave me great restaurant suggestions as well as recommended a local florist. The room was very comfortable, with a great view.  The hotel location was perfect, adjacent to the famous Temple Bar area, and next to Trinity College. Even though our window was directly across the main street, the noise level was very manageable. I would definitely recommend.",5,2010,11,18
202,not five star quality,"I got a good rate on Lastminute.com but would be a bit put out if I had paid their advertised rates.

On the positive side, the building is beautiful, the location is wonderfully central and the cocktails in the Mint bar are excellent. However, I am very surprised that they still hold onto a 5 star rating as I've stayed in many 4 stars that were better.

There was no offer to take our bags at check in, the in room facilities were basic enough, they were stingy with the tea bags, only provided 2 uht milk things (I hate UHT milk!), not even a biscuit, the socket beside the kettle didn't work, the ceiling in the bathroom was very low making the shower uncomfortable (and I'm not even tall!). We requested a newspaper and it wasn't delivered and the charge to use their wifi was exorbinant.",3,2010,11,16
202,"Good Location, details could be better","The Hotel is in a great location, well placed for exploring the city.  The reception area was very nice and the staff were friendly.  Room 313 overlooked the street which was handy to check the weather and watch everyone passing by.  Small details in the room let things down.  The sheets had a few holes, which was a shame when the hotel prides itself on it's beds.  Also the bathroom needed a good scrub.  The grout was dirty and the shower smelt bad, which I think was from mould on the ceiling.  If the room had been squeaky clean, the stay would have been perfect.",4,2010,11,15
202,Excellent Hotel,"I stayed in the beautiful presidential ""College Suite"" at the Westin Dublin and found everything about the hotel to be above and beyond from the food in the exchange, the cocktails in the Mint to the warm welcome and fond farewell. A great city centre hotel",5,2010,10,31
202,"Wonderful hotel, amazing staff, couldn't ask for more","We stayed at the Westin for an anniversary weekend.  The hotel was brilliantly located for Grafton Street and Temple Bar.  We had a wonderfully warm welcome and we were offered an 80e upgrade to a suite, which we took up - and it was so worth it.  The rooms were enormous, very comfortable with a luxurious bathroom.  The bed was soooooo comfy!  
We were presented with a platter of cakes in the hotel with 'Congratulations' written on the plate in chocolate, and 2 cards from the hotel manager and the lovely lady who checked us in.
The staff knew it was a special occasion and offered to source a restaurant for our evening meal - we had a call within a couple of minutes to say a table was booked for us at a local Italian, which I must say I found a little pushy - but when we arrived, we had the best table in the restaurant, a free glass of champagne and amazingly attentive service. First class.  We slipped in to the salsa evening in the downstairs bar at the Westin on our return and it was fabulous - a very young crowd, but welcoming and friendly.
The staff couldn't do enough for us - the consierge and the turn down service were excellent.
Couldn't recommend the hotel more, I wouldn't stay anywhere else for our next visit!",5,2010,10,30
202,Grand hotel in the heart of temple bar,"My husband and I booked a long weekend in Dublin for labor day weekend as a treat for our extended family, and our goal was to use Starwoods points for his parents and aunt.  The hotel was more than accommodating about exchanging points for rooms, and with the location, we figured this would be a great hotel for us.  Checking in, the hotel was even nicer than I expected with a grand old lobby and beautiful common areas.  The building is the site of an old Irish bank and they've kept that feel in the common spaces, and the hip ""vault"" bar.  Having been to Europe many times, we expected the rooms to be a bit smaller than American hotels but we were pleasantly surprised at the spacious and well-laid out sleeping rooms.  And the soaking tubs were a hit with our family!  The entire staff couldn't have been nicer to us, and were happy to fetch cabs, make dinner recommendations, and ask how our stay was.  The surrounding area can get a bit raucous at night (and especially on weekends during the summer) but it was worth it for the older members of our group to be able to easily and quickly walk to so many of the tourist attractions.  I'd definitely go back!",5,2010,10,27
202,Great hotel,"Lived in the Westin for 2 months while my spouse was working in Ireland.   We checked out every weekend so stayed in a few different rooms.  

The location of the hotel is perfect for exploring Dublin and all major attractions are within walking distance.  I recommend if you are a light sleeper that you request a higher floor or an interior facing room as the hotel is sandwiched between Trinity College and Temple Bar (most famous nightlife area) so the street noise can be fairly loud. 

Our rooms varied in size and layout because of the hotel being constructed from already existing buildings.  Cleaning is on point, although some of the carpets and furniture are a little worn.   The library suites with the spiral staircases up to their sitting room are quite unique. 

It‚Äôs a very comfortable hotel and outside of their host at breakfast, they have a very helpful and friendly staff.  He, on the other hand, was the one dark spot in what was really a lovely extended hotel stay.  His manner is quite rude. Even after weeks of going to breakfast every morning he acted as if he had never seen us before and once made quite the issue with me when his list stated our room was only for 1 person.  Even after I told him he could feel free to charge me for the breakfast and I would work it out with the our hotel account contact myself he felt the need to interrupt my breakfast to state again that he didn‚Äôt think I was correct.  I had already been coming for breakfast every morning for a month .  I think it‚Äôs just his personality, but in comparison to the other staff members (the concierge hugged me upon our departure) he‚Äôs far from an asset to the hotel.  Dublin is such a warm welcoming place his attitude just seems really out of place.

The breakfast buffet has all the normal choices as well as an ala carte menu.  The atrium area is a nice place for an afternoon tea and the downstairs restaurant is great point for a pint to start the evening. 

We were very happy with our stay and would definitely recommend for the convenient location, wonderful service and nice accommodations.",4,2010,10,26
202,Perfect Location,"We chose this hotel  because of its location it was perfect in the heart of everything and most places were walking distance.Stayed in a  junior suite, clean and spacious. Reception were helpful with directions and suggested areas to visit and restaurants to dine in. Only issue was cost of parking but the stay in the hotel overall was great, would recommend to friends.",4,2010,10,25
202,Best positioned hotel in Dublin,My husband and I stayed at this lovely hotel on a 2 night trip to Dublin. The hotel used to be the allied Irish bank and has all the grandeur you'd expect. The location is perfect for any trip to Dublin. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay.,5,2010,10,22
202,"Great location and service, but old plumbing.","We stayed 2 nights.  We couldn't have been happier with the location.  Reasonable price too.  Busy and safe at night.  Easy to walk to everything.  Temple Bar and Ha Penny Bridge are 5 minutes away.  St Stephen's Green and Grafton St are that close too.  Trinity College is across the street.  Merrion Square is 10-15 min away.  St Pat's and Dublin Castle 15-20 min walk.  Guiness about 20-25 min walk away.  Great service and wonderful beds.  Only downside was the toilet plumbing, but the building is very old.  There was plenty of hot water and a great tub though.  Even loved the toiletries.  The AirCoach from the airport drops off around the corner and picks up across the street every 15 minutes during the day.  We'd stay there again in a heartbeat!",5,2010,10,16
202,Excellent location!,"My husband & I stayed at the Westin for our trip to Dublin. The hotel was in an amazing location - right in the middle of everything. We were within quick walking distance to tons of shopping, lots of great bars, and a quick cab ride to the train station to visit other parts of Ireland. The hotel staff was very friendly & the concierge had lots of suggestions for places to eat & things to do. They gave us a discount for the on/off bus (which I highly recommend) and they made reservations for us for dinners and shows. They also have a very nice tea that they do, but unfortunately we never had the time. If you are visiting Dublin and need a hotel this is the place to stay - it is seriously in the best location - right next to the college. I also recommend taking trains to Cork, Galway and Waterford - we also did a tour of the Cliffs of Moher - and make sure you go to the Blarney Castle and kiss the stone!!! Just an FYI the rooms in Europe are a little smaller than you might be used to, even the upgraded suites - but we weren't in our room much, we were trying to see as much as possible! Also make sure you bring plug adapters for the outlets!",5,2010,10,13
202,Comfortable stay in a great location,"First time to Europe and wasn't sure what to expect in a hotel.  We truly enjoyed our stay at The Westin!  It was comfortable, clean and quiet.  Walking distance to almost every place we intended to go to.  Restaurants and attractions were all nearby.",5,2010,10,08
202,Very good place to stay.,"Me and my partner have stayed in Westin for 2 nights when visited Dublin in February 2010. The hotel is beautiful and has a great atmosphere. Hotel stuff is very nice and friendly (apart from a doorman who was in charge at 3am on Saturday night, but who wouldn't be a little bit grumpy if had to work on that time). The location is perfect. Our room was huge, very clean and with a great view. Bathroom was very clean and the minibar full of treats. We really enjoyed our stay and if we go to Dublin again, we will surely stay there as we tried another place before and it wasn't good at all.",5,2010,10,01
202,Great location & what you expect from a Westin,"This Westin is very well located in the center of town and next to Trinity College. It is in walking distance of great restaurants, museums and shopping.  It is very clean, and even when the hotel was completely full during our stay, it was very quiet.  The international staff is well-trained and helpful.  Great linens and comfy bed.  We used Starwood points for our stay.  Otherwise, expect to pay typical 5-star hotel in big city price.  We loved it, and would stay here again.",5,2010,09,24
202,"Cosy, Classy, Chique","I found the location of this Westin to be ideal. Not more than 3 minutes walk away from Grafton street on one side or the bigger shopping malls on the other it has all the convenience with none of the noise. Furthermore a bonus point on location is that the Bus which takes you to the airport stops directly in front of the Westin, literally 5 metres away. 

The foyer and entrance are elegant and appropriate given the Westin name, the concierge and welcoming staff are all serious yet helpful. A point of note being the wonderful doorman, Peter, who is even more friendly than your average Irish person (and that is saying something! )  

The rooms are cosy, if perhaps a little dark, and the beds fantastically comfortable. However the wireless internet is not free which is a shame, however this is to be expected. Another bonus point would be the mezzanine where you can have a wonderful stack of pancakes or even the traditional tea and scones with that sinful clotted cream! 

Overall a very enjoyable experience and will definitely be returning!",5,2010,09,22
202,"Just ""OK""","I was not impressed with the Westin Dublin.  The location is just OK, right across from Temple Bar which can be rowdy.  As you walk back to your hotel at night there are men urinating all over the walls right across from the hotel.  Teenage girls so drunk they are falling down.  If you go up a bit and stay off Grafton Street or closer to Stephens Green the prices are comparable but the location is so much nicer.  If you stay off Grafton street you can still walk to the Temple Bar area if you want but you are in a much nicer area.

For a Westin this was just OK.  They had the heavenly beds which was nice but the rooms were old, run down and the lobby felt like a motel more than a hotel.  I wouldn't say anything terrible about the Westin, I would just recommend staying somewhere else.",3,2010,09,21
202,Excellent Location,"We chose this hotel over others in town because of its location and we weren't disappointed  The location of this hotel is perfect!  It is within easy walking distance of major sites.  It was very near Temple Bar but without any of the noise you might expect. We were able to upgrade to a junior suite. It was spacious, clean, quiet and full of light. Service was less than attentive. When we arrived, no one offered to help us with our bags and service in the atrium lounge was slow and perfunctory.",4,2010,09,19
202,Expected More,"Our group of 6 stayed 4 nights in 3 rooms. It was the second hotel we used in Dublin since we took a side trip to Edinburgh. We selected it because it appeared to be comparable to the first one, and in a better location to explore the city on the other side of the Liffey. It certainly had a great location for this.
The initial lobby experience did not produce any sort of great to be here satisfaction. The fact that we were arriving sort of late, and it was rainy outside may have contributed to this. The check in experience was business like, where it could have been a bit friendlier.
The hotel decoration is more traditional. You noticed in many locations the nicks and scrapes on the walls, etc. that you would expect not to see in a hotel of this rating. These shortcomings in the rooms were more evident.
We found only one bar of soap in the room, and it was awkwardly shaped. In our room with my wife, not so much of a problem, but in the other rooms which my son/daughter shared with their friends traveling with us, it was not very hygienic. There is no excuse for this type of economy.
We reported a problem with the toilet in one room. It did not function as those in the other two rooms. Twice the maintenance department note left in the room said that it was working fine. We had two rooms which indicated otherwise, and have stayed in many hotels all over Europe without any problems. The on-duty manager that came up to the room after we received the second note was apologetic and asked what else he could do, but my daughter chose to stay and work around the problem rather than move say to another room. We also asked him to replace a burned out bulb that was in the room when we checked into it. I mentioned the soap issue as well, and he stated that it was the hotel norm to provide only one bar.
Our wake up calls were handled ok except the last day when we were leaving for the US. The first call requested went to my daughter's room rather than ours, the follow up call 15 minutes later came to our room.
Our room, 525, was large, but it had a small wall hung LCD TV. The others had a larger TV not wall hung. The small TV looked out of place for this hotel's category.
The day before we left, we left a tip and note for housekeeping asking for more soap. The tip was not taken, and the soap was not provided. When we checked out of the room, all that was left of the soap we had was about the size of a penny.
We used the concierge to set up a restaurant reservation, and they did this for us. They slipped a note in our room regarding it, and mentioned the person at the restaurant that took the reservation.
Friday night is Salsa night at the hotel, and although we come from where Salsa is common, we did not check it out. It did sound quite lively.
I think with a little bit of effort and more attention to details by the hotel our stay would have been significantly more satisfying than it was. Our recommendation for it is conditioned to awareness of some of the shortcomings we experienced.",4,2010,09,18
202,Great location but the room needed a good scrubbing!,My husband and I are big Westin fans yet we were disappointed with this hotel.  Although the location can not be beat we felt that the service and attention to detail were lacking.  We  reserved a King Bed but that was not available when we arrived.  They only had a Queen sized bed which was very inconvenient as my husband and I are both over 6 feet tall.  The staff made no appologies for the error.  My biggest issue was with the cleanliness of the room.  The couch and carpet were filthy with visable stains.  The doors and windows had dirty hand prints which I cleaned with handy wipes!  My husband also felt nickeled and dimed by the Internet and parking fees.,3,2010,09,16
202,VERY BAD VALUE & SERVICE,"We booked the hotel via Lastminute.com and were really looking forward to a 5 star hotel in town.
The first thing when we got to the hotel was were were charged ‚Ç¨25 for using the car park (meant to be a 5 star hotel!). They then charged us ‚Ç¨30 extra to ""upgrade"" the room.

The upgraded room was smaller than any room I have ever stayed in in any hotel, when we complained about the extra charge for a tiny room we were told we could go back to an even smaller room!

There was no swimming pool in the hotel, the spa have no treatments available.....

We felt ripped off and as though the hotel policy was to just squeeze as much as possible from customers.

Many other proper 5 star hotels in Dublin to stay in!",1,2010,09,15
202,STANDARD OF SUITE FOR SPG,"I am a platinum SPG member and have been faithfully staying with this chain of hotels for almost every trip.  Since SPG chain of hotels are 5-star hotels, i always expect the best from it, that is from the room, quality of bed to the food, served in its restaurants.  I have enjoyed my recent stay in Westin Seoul, Westin Tokyo and Pulitzer Amsterdam last week.  All these exceeded my expectation and i am truly proud of staying there.  However, i must say that i did not enjoy my hotel stay at Westin Dublin.  It is really disappointing to find the room lack of many essentials.  Foremost, i paid for a good upgrade but was given a normal suite that i could get without paying extra.  The suite is rather small, toilet is not flushing well, there's no tissue papers, no complimentary water, etc.  Breakfast served is limited to small selection of dishes and only 2 cheeses!  I thought Ireland is a country of plentiful cheese since i saw many cows and sheeps roaming around happily?!
I hope the management will take a serious look in the matter and improve on the quality of this hotel.  It's 5 star after all!  Thank you for your kind consideration.",3,2010,09,14
202,Not really 5 star,Superb location for visiting Dublin as a Tourist.  All the guides and tourist buses are just around the corner. Trinity College Temple Bar & Grafton St Shops all so near.   Bedroom not the biggest although bed cloths towels carpets all very clean and good quality.  Hotel staff were all friendly.  Breakfast was not part of the deal so had to pay seperately but on seeing the prices not prepared to pay 27 euro per person!  Went across the road to a cafe every morning and for 5 euro had a nice breakfast and coffee.,4,2010,08,29
202,Luxurious! Exactly what you would expect from Starwood!!!,"I stayed at The Westin for 25 nights on Business and they gave me a Deluxe room. Its a starwood hotel and that is exactly what you pay for and get!

I enjoyed every bit of attention I was given because of the length of my stay and by the time my stay ended, it felt like a home away from home. I was down there during the summer so it was nice to take advantage of the long days and short nights. I got a room facing the Temple Bar so it was busy until late at night. However, that didnt disturb my sleep.. the room had a comfortable bed and the noises were buried out from the french windows. Ask for a room facing the Trinity College when you get here.

It is 2 mins walk to Grafton street; the shopping district of Dublin. There are plenty of vegetarian choices with a few Indian places too. Although when down there, I didnt try any Indian restaurants. Its located right on college green and possibly every place you want to visit as a tourist with either within walking distance or a bus ride away (under 3 EUR per person). 

They gave me free internet since they had a tie-up with my company, but otherwise I think it is charged. The speed was pretty good.

Since I went on business, the company paid for the 25 nights. However, the price is hefty for me if I went on a holiday. But given a chance I would love to splurge at the Westin and relax with my hubby on a long holiday in Ireland.",5,2010,08,26
202,Westin Hotel Dublin - great bar - great Sunday brunch - great rooms!,"Spent a lovely weekend in my home town - in the Westin - for my birthday. Had a lovely one bedroom Suite (kinda) overlooking Trinity College (if you strained to see it!) with a great lay out. Bathroom (well stocked) to the left, separate bedroom (behind double doors) to the right, with really comfy huge bed and tv)..straight ahead and up couple of steps - the living room (fully equiped) Can't fault the room!  The Mint bar has very well trained staff, excellent cocktails and on Fridays there is live music with Salsa/ Latin dancing, which appears to attract a lot of South American local community. Very entertaining and inspiring to watch!
The Sunday brunch in the exchange is worth every penny. For a price per head (I think about ‚Ç¨45?) you can eat from any of the food stations..in a lovely restaurant setting..and the selection of food is fab! A really nice little hidden 'great value' gem..in the centre of Dublin..for a special occasion.",4,2010,08,25
202,Nice Hotel,"The rooms are nice. Upgraded to have a city view. I am not sure it was worth the money since we had to close the curtains in order to cool the room down. My one complaint was that the A/C didn't really cool the room and you could not open the windows.

The beds were wonderful, and enjoyed having a large bathroom with walk in shower. 

I give the Westin extra points; there were two luggage racks in the room. A rarity",4,2010,08,24
202,centrally located in an old bank building,"we had two interconnected rooms for a family of 4. the buffet was ok. the staff helpful. the beds heavenly like all westins. the location just amazing with trinity college 3 minutes away and O'Connell Street 5 minutes in the other direction. The Mint Bar and Lounge is nice although on World Cup Finals evening, it was dead probably because it has no TVs. We enjoyed our stay here a lot.",5,2010,08,20
202,Pretty good,"Excellent central location, reasonable rooms, good service from both lobby and bar staff. Would definitely recommend it",4,2010,08,17
202,Insulting Staff...Nice rooms...Very little useful space in the hotel,"Pros:
Daragh is a super concierge. Helpful beyond expectations. The bright spot on the staff...
Nice rooms. Clean, modern, and comfy.

Cons:
Insulting staff. Rigel was very rude. I have never felt less welcomed at an SPG property, ever. And I have been to dozens. She made me feel like there wasn't even a room available for me, and I would think there would be for a Platinum SPG member that made the reservation 6 months ahead of time. She had a pin that said she had been with Starwood for at least 5 years, but did not know whether Platinum members got free internet access. She had to ask. How can you be there for over 5 years and not know simple things like that. She twice had to go to the back room behind the Front Desk to find out things...the first time it seemed like she went back there to see if she even had a room available. The way she treated me as a guest was odd, socially inept and strange for an SPG employee. It set a very bad tone.

There is very little common space in this hotel. It felt like it was just a nice building with a lot of rooms. I would expect more from a Westin in terms of space to be able to sit and relax outside the rooms...It just felt like a 2.5 star hotel where you come into a small lobby and go straight to your room.

I would recommend if you want to spend a large sum of money for a nice room and nothing else, and you don't mind rude service.",3,2010,08,15
202,Great location,"We stayed in The Westin in Dublin, Ireland.  It was so centrally located that it was close to everywhere we went.  The National Library of Ireland is just two blocks away.  We walked down Grafton Street to the Gaity Theatre and felt safe.  There are taxis waiting right outside to take you to the airport or where ever you need to go.  Since we did not have a car, I was glad we spent the money for the stay.  It was well worth it.  
On the down side- $30 Euros to watch TV is a bit expensive.",5,2010,08,10
202,Perfect location and very nice staff,I loved everything about this hotel.  The concierge was very nice about restaurant recommendations.  The location is also ideal.,5,2010,08,03
202,"Central location, consistent with top Westin properties, will return","Perfectly situated, clean, modern and functional.  Adjacent to all the action (Grafton, Temple Bar etc.) but far enough to get away from it all.  Top marks all round and will be back.  If you're ""in season"" don't miss the GAA games (football & hurling), a highlight of our trip.",4,2010,08,02
202,Wonderful Stay - Coming Back Again,I love the Westin Hotels and this one lives up to the reputation. I spent 2 nights here last summer before heading on to ferry across to Wales and continuing to London. I am meeting up with my daughter and son-in-law on the 13th of August. I refused to stay at the hotel they are booked in because I must return to where I received such lovely treatment and service. The rooms are exceptional - the beds wonderful - the staff is charming - and room service was prompt and courteous. The location is ideal - right across from Trinity College. I am a Church musician with little time to travel. I want to make my vacations memorable and the Westin Dublin helped to make that possible.,5,2010,07,30
202,A weekend in the Westin,"We spent an enjoyable weekend at the Westin. Reception was quick and friendly. We received an ""irresistible"" offer to upgrade our booked room for the ""Presidential Suite"" for only 100 EUR/night/person - which we declined. This offer came accross rather rehearsed and it was a little bit irritating. 

Our room was small, but nice. Lots of charm. The window was facing a side street and could be opened (trading in fresh air for street noise). Very clean hotel, courteous staff, excellent location (only 1 minute from Temple Bar and Trinity College). 

We would recommend this hotel when you are willing to pay its price. The overall quality is high. The Concierge and Reception Services were good. Breakfast can still be improved, we had to ask for additional butter (only a tiny bit was standing on each table) and we had to ask for toast to go with our ""Full Irish Breakfast"". We would have expected the waiter to offer this.",4,2010,07,29
202,Really excellent.,Giving the Westin both thumbs up. Perfect base for our city break. The bed was really wonderful. Loved the afternoon tea too. We got a good deal that included an upgrade to a Junior suite for a small supplement.,5,2010,07,26
202,Heaven in Dublin,"I had the pleasure of winning a prize of two night stay at the Westin Dublin, and booked it for a weekend in July to coincide with my 50th birthday. I mentioned this as the time of booking and when checking in, I was delighted to find that the hotel management had given me a suite. 

Not only that, but there was a bottle of wine waiting for us along with a birthday dessert! What a nice touch it was.

And what a suite it was......themed on G.B Shaw, spread over two floors, the living area was sumptous: armchairs with huge cushions, ottomans for tired feet, and the best coffee I have had in a hotel room for a long time.

The bed was great, lovely soft pillows and a balcony too. 

The hotel is actually an old bank and the basement bar is what used to be a vault. Very nice and the upstairs bar is in a 5 storey atrium which is the perfect place to have a coffee and relax. The bar menu is good and offers good value too.

The hotel is a short stroll form all the main shopping areas and the aircoach express to the airpost stops literally across the road. 

Breakfast is served in the main restaurant which is decorated in are deco style. The large tables and very comfy chairs make for a very relaxing meal. The food is excellent both in range and quality. 

There is a business centre for those who need to work with complimentary internet access and printer.

My wife and I thoroughly enjoyed our (too short) stay in the Westin Dublin.  All staff we encountered were very friendly and helpful. The management went out of their way to make this a special time for us, and we are very grateful for this. 

If anybody is staying in Dublin city centre, there is no better place to stay.",5,2010,07,25
202,Excllent location and fantastic beds,"Stayed for two nights.
Excellent location and close to everything: Temple Bar, Trinity College, O'Connell street and more. The Westin beds are fantastic as usual.
Our room faced the inner courtyard and was very quite. The marble bathroom is great, with a shower and a bath.
The fitness room was very small.
Breakfast (not included in our rate) was not bad.",5,2010,07,19
202,Dilemma,"I stayed in the Westin twice, I found the beds comfortable, and the hotel location excellent.  On one visit I had to move rooms until I was actually in a room which I considered quiet, but apart from that things were generally good.  My main issue was with the staff, my best friend lives in Dublin and he was treated very rudely when he came to visit me on one occasion, I actually complained I was so mortified by the treatment of a dear friend.  I'm actually planning to be in Dublin again in September and I am more likely than not going to stay at the Westin due to my previous experiences.  I am in Dublin a few times a year and have yet found a hotel to call home...",2,2010,07,12
202,"Good Stay, Close to everything.","Hotel was very convienient. Not too close and not too far from temple bar, great for pub hopping. Right across the street from Trinity college. Also close to St. Steven's Green. Friendly staff and clean hotel. Rooms were a little old but clean enough. Club in the basement was fun, good drinks.",4,2010,07,07
202,Lovely Hotel in a Superb Location.,The Westin Dublin is in a great location between Grafton Street and O' Connell Street so is perfect for exploring the city. The bedroom was rather plain and had very generic furniture; nothing special in general. It could have been a hotel room in any part of the world! The bed was very comfortable and I slept very well. I had breakfast and dinner in the hotel. The food and service was very good and I can certainly recommend eating there. The pub is a pleasant place to spend a few hours but expect to pay top prices for the drinks there! I would certainly stay at the Westin Dublin again!,4,2010,07,06
202,Visited family in Dublin,Have stayed many times at The Westin...wonderful hotel and all the staff is brilliant.,5,2010,07,02
202,Service and location superb,"We stayed at the Westin Dublin for 40,000 points for 5 nights; considering it was essentially free we were delighted by the exceptional service we've come to expect from Westin.  My husband and I both have some experience in the hospitality industry (hence all those points) so we appreciate consistency and service above all else.  In this, the Westin couldn't have been beat.  We were greeted at every turn, no matter at what hour; restaurant reservations were made for us when we asked and received follow-up phone calls regarding those reservations, and...most importantly...in no way did we feel as though we used points instead of paying in Euros.  We used the fitness center (excellent, and a great place to fill up water bottles btw) as well as the aforementioned concierge services.  

The only place I'm docking points is the room. At check-in we were offered a queen bed instead of our reserved king, but with a view of Trinity College. We took it not because we cared about the view (which was more noise than special and through one narrow window) but because we did feel a little bit of pressure to change our reservation because we were on points.  The room was large but oddly shaped; the bathroom was, however, exceptionally sized.  The bed also seemed to be a full size instead of a queen and we suffered through the week from it.  Additionally, the temperature control didn't work and the windows were sealed shut.  Yeah, I know, we could have said something and changed rooms, but after changing locations over the past week in Ireland we eyed our bags as enemies and the small-ish bed as a friend.  I certainly don't hold this against the hotel; again, they would have done anything to keep us happy (hence, our brand loyalty).  But, as a 4 or 5-star property, each room should retain the same comfort standard as others despite the particular footprint of the room.

Aside from the hotel's particular accommodations, the most important aspect of the hotel is the LOCATION.  I can't say enough positive things about the hotel's situation; it enabled us to eat at some of the finest restaurants and going to the best attractions while being able to go to the bathroom in comfort. Yes, I went there.  Plus, there is a clock on the bank next door (I think; it's been a few months) which stands as an excellent landmark from the street; you can easily locate the hotel from there.  Once the bellman opens the door and you smell the signature white tea Westin scent, you immediately feel calmed from the busy streets.  It's a haven from busy Dublin life.  Overall, I'd highly recommend this property most particularly because there are a few things you can't put an adequate price on: location, service, and your sense of well-being once you're inside.",4,2010,07,01
202,perfect stay,"Just back from a week in Ireland and 3 days at the Westin in Dublin. What a wonderful stay in a great hotel. The staff was very friendly and helpful. My teenagers stayed in a roomy, bright  twin room and we were upgraded for a very reasonable price to the most gorgeous suite I have ever stayed in. Best location in Dublin with a very short walk to the Temple bar area as well as shopping and Trinity college. The hotel recommended two wonderful restaurants and made all the reservations as well as arranging transportation to the airport. I looked at many hotels before I booked the Westin in Dublin and I am so glad that I picked it. One of the best overall hotel experiences I have ever had in traveling.",5,2010,06,28
202,Great Hotel in the Heart of Dublin!,"My son and I recently traveled to Ireland on a golf trip.  We arrived in Dublin because we wanted to experience the ""pubs"" and do some sightseeing.  We stayed three nights at the Westin and the quality of our room and level of service we received was fantastic.  The hotel is also conveniently located at the beginning of the temple bar area, and near the shopping of Grafton Street,  but is not subject to the noise you would expect from the bars in the area.  We found the Westin was a convenient walk or short taxi ride to all of the local places of interest as well as golf.  Our room was nicely appointed, clean and comfortable.  I highly recommend the Hotel for anyone staying in Dublin.",5,2010,06,18
202,Ideal location for city sites,"We chose the Westin because of its location and it didn't disappoint. The hotel is directly across from Trinity College and Temple Bar area. The tour buses pickup just a block away and there are many fine restaurants nearby. The Atrium lounge is very pleasant for a light meal;  the Irish breakfast, included in our room rate, was excellent. The staff was very attentive, friendly and knowledgeable. Our son became ill while there and they had a doctor to us within an hour!  If you have time, take a cab out to Howth (30 min. drive) for dinner at Aqua. The harbor is beautiful and the restaurant is excellent.",4,2010,06,03
202,Outstanding location and service,"We stayed at The Westin for a total of six nights during a two week period. Our overnight flight arrived early and we were so very grateful to be able to get into our room early in the morning having been traveling for hours with multiple flights. The location is idea, next to Trinity College and close to major downtown attractions. The staff was helpful in arranging tours, printing boarding passes and dealing with luggage. The doorman, front desk staff, laundry service and housekeeping were all top notch. The Mint is great if you are too tired to venture out to eat. Kudos to all.",5,2010,06,03
202,"Location, location, location.","Stayed here as a birthday treat for 2 nights. Very good location for centre of dublin, temple square and shopping. 
arrived early and was checked in easily into nice clean but fairly average room. Small bed, but very comfortable.
Bathroom clean and good towels- although the shower was powerful it was far too low and couldnt be adjusted-and im 5ft3!!!
cant really comment much about food or staff as didnt eat in or really see any staff coming in and out. 
Over priced- but find me somewhere that isnt in dublin!!!!
Nice hotel but stayed in nicer, location is the key here.",4,2010,05,24
202,"Loved it, but it lacked something","Stayed for two nights in January for a busy few days.
Check in was good and valet service good and also punctual on checkout. 
 While I love the location for convenience, I hated it for the traffic noise. We had a lovely room, spacious, comfy etc The bathroom, while large (entering through double doors), was a little dated. The shower, when running, was backing up with a blocked drain. Service was excellent; we requested a champagne bucket to the room as we checked in, and staff came immediately with it. He looked after the champagne for us, filling the ice bucket and suggesting how long it required to chill. He was right! We went out to our function and came back to a perfect bottle. The first night was a late night, socially for us, so we weren't in the room long that night for sleeping, but the second night I really noticed it....I was counting Dublin buses! 
I like the Mint bar, downstairs,(I'm a sucker for the cocktails) but the night we went in, it was hopping with loud music; I don't know what it was, possibly Afro-Caribbean music, with lots of very sweaty dancing people! I have to say, with the low ceilings, it was unbearable..we left without a drink (unusual for me!)
 Had afternoon tea the second day. It was good but I've had better..Irish coffee was good, but overall a little expensive, although I'm mad about the location in the Atrium. Didn't have breakfast or dinner in hotel as we had a hectic social schedule that weekend",4,2010,05,20
202,"Great - location, cost, quality and all the extras","took me a while to get on and upload this short review. Cost us abuot 20euros in cab from Dublin airport, not a far journey. Arrived and efficient staff, very elegant hotel with grand entrance right opposite Trinity College and great location for all teh areas and sights of Dublin (good base). Room was large and clean (internet not free though) sep shower and bath, molton brown toiletries. Good restuarant, great room service, livley bar in lower basement. Not much else to say (or that I can remember now). I'd defo stay there again when go back in June (for a wedding) and would recomment - although haven't stayed in other hotels so can't compare it. (ps they ahve a gym that you can use and a lovely courtyard bar that has a glass roof)",4,2010,05,10
202,Heavenly sleeps,"The Westin Hotel is located just around the corner from Grafton St and the Tourist Information Centre. It is opposite Temple Bar, close to Tara St DART station and a few minutes walk from O'Connell St. So it is in a brilliant location!

Staff on reception were efficient and welcoming. There are a wide range of choices for eating and drinking within the hotel itself, and lots more close by. We would recommend MJ O'Neills pub in Suffolk St for good food, live music and a good choice of what would be known in Britain as real ales!

After a meal and a few beers it was a lovely hotel to return to. The beds are described a s heavenly beds and they certainly are! My partner described it as the best sleep she has ever had in a hotel. The robes were very comfortable and there was both a bath and a shower! Little touches were everywhee, there were lights in the wardrobe that came on when you opened the door, beautiful toiletries and a quality TV!

We were very sorry to leave, and would stay there again ina  flash! The only small negative is that you have to be lucky to get a good rate, and there is no pedestrian crossing outside the hotel - you have tow alk to the end of the street to cross the road! But these are small points that don't detract form the quality of the Westin.",5,2010,05,07
202,Great,"We chose the Westin Dublin for one reason...location, location, location.....and let's be honest here, the expectation of quality that went with the price.  It did not disappoint.   Thank you for a lovely stay.",5,2010,05,06
202,Truly Royal Treatment,"This Weston was fashioned using 3 historical buildings that were combined and then beautifully remodeled in an ""old money"" style. If you prefer a  contemporary ambience, this may not be your hotel. But, if you enjoy plush surroundings, muted colors, a hushed atmosphere, and some of the most respectful and caring staff you have ever met, this hotel will meet your approval. It is located 1 block from from Dublin's upscale shopping street (Grafton), and if you walk to the LAUS (light rail) station at the end of that block(St. Stephen's Green) you can get a train to the Dundrumman  Mall, which is a huge contemporary shopping mall with trendy stores like Harvey Nichols. The Luas is a very clean/safe mode of transport that snakes through the southern portions of Dublin, and runs every 3-8 minutes.
Overall if you want to be tenderly cared, for in very plush surroundings, with some of the best shopping at your fingertips, this is your hotel!",5,2010,05,04
202,Excellent Location to visit Dublin,"The Westin Hotel is located in the Dublin city center, near the trinity college and to all bus stop (also airport bus stop).
The room was cosy, but the relationship quality price is not satisfactory: not a four star room!
I also heartly recommended the hotel beacuse the location is excellent for day and night.",3,2010,04,27
202,"Great Location, Good Service","We stayed at the hotel over the Easter weekend.  The hotel is perfectly located next door to Trinity College, right across from Temple Bar and within a short walk to most major sights.  We walked everywhere including to the Guinness brewery which was the farthest of the sights we saw.  We ate at the Atrium Lounge and the Exchange restaurant the first day we were there as Good Friday is a ""dry"" day in Dublin.  As a guest of the hotel, you could have a beer or a bottle of wine with a ""substantial meal"".  Also, a lot of restaurants were not open that day.  Both restaurants were very good, although the Atrium lounge service was a bit on the slow side.  We also enjoyed a couple of cocktails at the Mint lounge and enjoyed the live music that was playing on Saturday night.

Our room was spacious and clean but we could not seem to control the temperature of the room.  It was quite hot and dry and made it a bit uncomfortable to sleep.  The bathroom was also very large and clean though sometimes the shower was slow to drain.  However, neither of the above overshadowed our stay.

The staff was friendly and very helpful.  As SPG guests we were upgraded to the SPG floor at check in and they were very helpful recommending how to get around town and provided restaurant recommendations.  

Some other things of note:  One rainy afternoon we found ourselves at O'Neills pub and ended up having a wonderful meal.  Its sort of buffet style but great Irish comfort food.  Also, the concierge recommended Peploe's and we ate there on our last night.   Great food, very good wine list and excellent service.",4,2010,04,18
202,"Amazing Location, good but not stunning","Will have to agree with many here:

PROS:  Amazing location - center of all the tourist sites, can easily walk Dublin from here.  Comfy bed and well serviced.   Good gym by European standards.   Lovely common areas of the Mint Bar downstairs to the Lounge on the Mezzanine under the skylight.  Enjoyed the full bath in addition to a separate shower.  Tea/Coffee making facilities.

CONS:  Over priced for the property.  Very small rooms, No clock and low lighting and yes the heating dials are not the easiest to figure out - this are small issues but with the price, expect these to be well provided.",4,2010,04,17
202,First rate Dublin Hotel,"We stayed in this hotel for an Easter holiday getaway, and stayed in a Junior Suite.

From the moment we arrived the impression was positive.  The outside of the hotel is impressive, as much for the fact that it blends in so well to the surroundings rather than pretentiously shouting out ""5 Star Hotel!"".

The ambience of the hotel continued in the foyer, where the staff greeted us in an efficient and welcoming manner.  The duty manager could not have been more helpful, and the upgrade, to a Junior Suite, that he offered for a very reasonable cost made us feel even more welcome.

The quality of the room was spot on - and it matched my previous experiences of the Westin Brand - a genuine 5* experience.  In every respect the room was faultless, in particular there was not a spot of dust or grime anywhere either in the main room or the spacious bathroom.

The location is peerless in Dublin if visiting for tourism:  The hotel overlooks Trinity College, home of the Book of Kells; it is 5 minutes walk from the National gallery; it is steps away from Grafton Street the main shopping area; and is on the doorstep of Temple Bar's non-stop nightlife.  Dublin tour buses depart 50m from the door, and if walking is no problem, with a map you can easily walk to almost all the top attractions in Dublin.  In London you would pay double the cost to get such a well located hotel.

Parking is a real issue in City Centre Dublin, so don't be surprised at the valet parking fees, it is ‚Ç¨25 a night.  If you're arriving into Dublin airport go without a car for the time you're in Dublin.",5,2010,04,07
202,A lovely hotel in a great location.,"Westin Dublin - Stayed at this hotel in December 2009 for 2 nights with my teenage sister.  Hotel staff were lovely, friendly and helpful.

The bedroom was very spacious but we had an 'inside' room with no views and a non-opening window but it didn't feel claustrophobic.

The TV had loads of channels including a few British channels, and the beds were very comfy.

My only faults were the lack of a view and an opening window, and the marble bathroom floor which was FREEZING in December (no underfloor heating!).",4,2010,04,04
202,Great place to stay,This place was a great hotel to stay for the week. The service was excellent. The breakfast was if it was homemade. All the waiters were cooperative. The rooms had a decor like no other hotel i have stayed in. The bathrooms were clean and organized. The hallways and the scenery was pleasant. The staff members were all kind and helpful. I will defiantly come here next year and stay at this hotel.   Bye   Thanks John,5,2010,04,04
202,Great location virtually faultless stay,"I stayed here for the Ireland v Wales rugby weekend and I love the place. 

Great welcome from the doorman, reception desk wasquiet so I was promptly checked into a deluxe room on the 6th floor. Bellman was hovering and offered to take my bags but I was travelling light and prefer to carry my own.

The room wasvery large with nice furnishings and a stunning bathroom. My only negative about the whole hotel was that I found my room a bit dark, I wasn't in it much so it didn't matter. If i was working I would have needed some extra light. It was however really quiet, and with the heavenly bed I slept well. (that could have something to do with the Guiness)

I didn't use the restaurant but breakfast room service arrive spot on time and was of a very high quality.hot and fresh.

The mint bar in the basement is absolutely brilliant. Even on a busy rugby weekend the service was efficient and friendly with virtually no waiting time.

All in all this hotel has a great location, ideal for Temple Bar or the city centre,and I really enjoyed my stay.",5,2010,03,30
202,"Nice, but...","I agree with reiewers about the room inconveneiences-- no outlets in bathroom for hairdryer, a cofee pot with a two prong plug when there were no two prong outlets in room (save for a high speed line that said DO NOT REMOVE), no clock in room, limited drawer space, crazy reading lights and weak amenities ( shamoo, soap, etc),, no daily paper.  Expect more fron a hotel of this class. In fact, one day my room wasn't even cleaned.   Given a great location and overall decor, I would  stay again, but these little annoyances are not what I would expect from a hotel brand of this caliber/ Plus, 45 euro for a rollaway bed?  Thjat's offensive, particualry  when you're SPG.",3,2010,03,29
202,"Can't beat the location, but the service had a few hiccups.","The Westin, Dublin is an excellent hotel for a working vacation in Dublin!  Located in the heart of City Center, sights and activities are just minutes away.  We had an excellent room with a great view of Trinity College and a very large bathroom.  The beds were incredible and the housekeeping staff does a wonderful job.  The in-room internet access and business center made keeping up with meetings and clients effortless.  We were impressed with the quality of food in both the Exchange and the Mint Bar.  Overall, it was a wonderful stay.

However, while the hotel staff was always friendly and willing to help, the service left much to be desired for a hotel of this class.  The largest infraction was a missed wake-up call, which is almost unforgivable on a business trip.  Luckily, it happened on a weekend and so only our ten colleagues had to wait in the lobby for us, and not clients.  While the staff and managers were extremely apologetic, we felt that sufficient recompense was never offered (we were given breakfast one morning).

It seemed that communication within the hotel staff was weak.  For example, we waited five hours for requested extra towels before having to ask a second time.  Another time we ordered dinner in the hotel bar and waited 45 minutes before discovering that the order had never printed in the kitchen (even though we had checked in with the server a few times and he kept telling us our food was on the way).  Since we had an appointment, we had no dinner that night.  Finally, when I gave them my Starwood rewards number, they actually signed me up for a new account, instead of crediting my current account.  These inconveniences, while mostly small, should not happen in a Westin.  I hope that the management can smooth out the wrinkles to make future stays more enjoyable.",4,2010,03,29
202,Hotel is fabulous and wonderful staff.Worth staying even if its just one day,"Hotel is one of the most recommended places to stay at.A little costlier, but its well worth the bucks paid for! Bed is really heavenly along with the mint bar which rejuvenates the tired soul.",4,2010,03,19
202,Best 4-Star Location in Dublin,"There isn't a hotel with a better location in Dublin. Right in the City Centre, next to Trinity College, easy walk to most of the sights of the town. Fantastic bed, roomy accommodations, no street noise, full wi-fi, flat screen TV, etc. Thinks it is a 5-Star and has 5-Star prices, e.g. martini for $15.00, room service breakfast for $45.00, etc. 

But the poor maintenance of the facility negates its supposed 5-Star rating. Our room had a shower whose water temperature fluctuated radically, a sink that wouldn't drain, a bathroom fan that ran 24/7, a thermostat that did not function, a crazy system of lights where you couldn't read in bed with your bed lamp without an overhead light on, no plug in the bathroom for a hair dryer so you had to use it over the work table. The lobby had two welcoming hearths, but they were only lit 25% of the time in the evening; the concierge was a rookie; and they wanted to charge a 5% commission on a traveller's cheque in euros (that's 1800% interest!). Great place to stay, but only if you get it for a big discount as otherwise you will find it doesn't measure up to a true high class hotel.",4,2010,03,06
202,Superb hotel!  So glad we found it!,"Just back from a romantic weekend in Dublin and I couldn't be happier with our hotel selection!  From the minute we walked in - I was impressed.
The location is perfect for everything - Temple Bar, Trinity College, and Grafton Street for shopping.  I was constantly surprised at how close it was as we arrived to the door!
The rooms was great - we changed rooms as our reservation was for a King and we were initially put in a double.  It was rectified immediately and we stayed on the 4th floor (SPG Gold members).  The 2nd room was ACE - spaciious, very clean, loads of mirrors and plugs, the bathroom was massive with a separate shower/tub.  Very luxurious.
And the reason we always choose a Westin didn't disappoint - the bed!! By far the most comfortable (consistently) bed in any hotel (and I travel all the time.)
Service overall was pretty good as well.
We didn't eat in the restaurant nor bar, so can't comment there.
Definitely recommend!!",5,2010,03,04
202,Worth writing a review for...!,"I have never bothered to review anywhere I've stayed but thought this time I should. The hotel was beautiful and not too big so you didn't feel like 'just another guest'. 
The staff were all very friendly and we were made to feel very at home.
It was our first trip to Dublin so wanted to see all the sights, many of which were on the doorstep which was ideal. Temple Bar is just across the road which was fun to see but very expensive to have drinks anywhere - tourist prices I guess!
We didn't have dinner in the hotel but had a great breakfast (didn't need lunch after that!!) and I was treated to afternoon tea before we left which was fantastic. They have it in the Atrium which is a beautiful place to sit. Only negative - delayed flight on the way home. All in all, a great weekend break.",5,2010,02,23
202,"Wonderful stay, fantastic location","Thoroughly enjoyed our stay at The Westin. We had a finely appointed room overlooking the atrium. The room itself was well decorated and spacious. The hotel is pleasantly bright and the bar downstairs is a lot of fun (there was a salsa night when we were there).
It is a fantastic location right in the heart of the city centre.",5,2010,02,22
202,Wonderful hotel and wonderful staff,"We spent 4 nights at this hotel.  The staff was so nice and so helpful with my lost luggage.  The rooms are very clean and spacious.  The convenience of the location cannot be beat.  I loved this place and always enjoyed returning to our room before running out to see more of the wonderful city.  Stay here, it is worth it!",5,2010,02,10
202,"Great Service, Location and Comfort","The hotel is wonderfully located at the junction between all major Dublin attractions and points of interest. The hotel staff is welcoming, firendly and helpful. The room was clean and comfortable, but nothing too exceiting. Only shortcoming could be some street noise during the weekend if you get a city view room.",5,2010,02,07
202,Loved it!,"I usually write lengthy reviews, but I'll keep it short here as I do not need an awful lot of words to describe this place.

Location: great. Steps away from attractions and main shopping areas
Staff: good, what you expect from a Westin. When we didn;t find any toiletries in our room, the person at front desk almost looked shocked (now that's service ;-)) Congierce had very good knowledge of nearby restaurants and did some excellent recommendations.
Room: was wonderful. Quite romantic even. Great shower and bath, big enough room overall(OK some US tourists will call it small but two reasonably sized people plus luggage fits easily), great bed. Our view wasn't the best but we're out a lot anyway.
OK one small point: it rains a lot in Ireland. Couldn't find any umbrellas when we went out. Would be great to be able to borrow one at a hotel of this class.

We took breakfast at restaurants in the area instead of at the hotel. Across the street there's a nice sandwich bar and there are good Irish breakfast options just minutes away.",5,2010,01,31
202,It's only OK-The Westbury is the way to go!,"the room was spotlessly clean.
the staff are pleasant and helpful.
the location is good.
Power shower separate from bath-great!
a/c which you can control rather than the hotel minimum settings-good!

However:

For the money- The Westbury beats it hands down.I agree with other posts that it is essentially at three/four star standard when it comes to decor. I didn't eat in the hotel, I was only in Dublin for the day so I ate out...as it happens we took afternoon tea and drinks at the Westbury and the consensus was that the Westbury beat the Westin hands down. It's location is better, it looks like an international five star, unlike the Westin which has traditional Irish decor. The staff are just as nice, the bed was in fact nicer and the room itself (we stayed in october of 2009 in the westbury).

If you are going to pay for the Westin...Pay for the Westbury instead!",3,2010,01,26
202,Three star hotel for a five star price,"Very central and so great location and base to tour around Dublin from. Common areas are impressive. We stayed in the classic room. It was small, oddly shaped, with a view of a huge, ugly  ''To Let'' sign. For a five star hotel there was no kettle in the room. Be sure to book  the car park space in advance at the hotel booking stage- there are only about 15 spaces. Staff were very helpful and pleasant.
All in all I've stayed in three star hotels with the equivalent standard.",3,2010,01,19
202,Good Location,I stayed here when I went to Dublin on a business trip.  The hotel itself is beautiful and centrally located...I was able to walk everywhere I wanted to go.  My room was a bit small but it was clean and functional.  The staff was also helpful and friendly.,4,2010,01,12
202,Great location for tourists,"As this was our first visit to Dublin, the Westin made a great base for exploring the city.
The lobby was warm and welcoming on a cold winter's day, bedroom and bathroom were spacious with powerful walk-in shower as well as bath, Coffee maker (ground coffee) and complimentary mineral water (on Preferred Guests floor). Suprised to find no handbook of hotel facilities, but then discovered all details (including restaurant times) available on a channel of the flat-screen tv (would have preferred hard copy, especially since tv sometimes took some coaxing to display main menu screen). Good choice at breakfast (including black and white pudding).",5,2010,01,05
202,romantic evening away - put in to a twin room!,"drama no. 1 - arrived here to be told that because we'd booked through a 3rd party (lastminute.com) we had unfortunately been allocated a twin room by mistake and as it was the last room available (it was new year's eve) they couldn't change our room! due to the nature of the beds the singles couldn't be pushed together! luckily the single beds were pretty big so we managed to snuggle up, but not a good start. my advise - check the small print when booking with lastminute.com. 
drama no. 2 - after showering and cleaning my face in preparation for getting ready to go out for our slap up dinner i realised i'd left my make up bag at home. argh!!! no emergency supplies at reception so concierge sent me off to 2 different pharmacies which he assured me were open til 10p.m. and both were shut. so new eyars eve was spent with a bare face! for a 5 star hotel, perhaps they should have a few bits and bobs for the girlies?
all in all, lovely hotel and good sized room, but reception services could be better!",3,2010,01,02
202,Disappointed after previous great stays here,"Stayed here for a Christmas package. This was our 3rd time to stay at this hotel. In the past I've been very impressed with it.I was disappointed this time though. We booked two interconnecting rooms. Our king sized room had not been cleaned  or made up and the previous occupants bed linen was thrown on the floor. Our kids room had clean bed linen but the table surfaces had not been cleaned and were full of crumbs. The duty manager was apologetic and we received a bottle of wine. However it spoiled the stay for us. Christmas dinner was a buffet and very much of the same standard as a pub carvery. Very disappointing  experience compared to previous stays. I always thought this was a 4 star and am surprised to see that its actually a 5 star as it does not have amenities such as a swimming pool.

On a positive note, all staff are extremely and helpful.",2,2009,12,26
202,Not up to standard,"This is an expensive 5 star hotel, however the rooms and service are definitely not up to standard. I stayed in this hotel several times for business and had issues to the service and cleanliness of the rooms on multiple occasions. The hotel isn't bad, but I expect a lot more from a hotel of this class.",3,2009,12,26
202,Claustrophobic room,"The good:
Beautiful building, chic interiors, comfortable beds, spacious room, clean+modern bathrooms. Pleasant enought staff.

The excellent:
The location is one of the best in the city, being central to both Northside and Southside, near shopping areas, nightlife, restaurants and easy access to sights.
The Mint Bar is the best cocktail bar in the city, pricey, but the it is a 5 star hotel.  You have to wait for them, but when they arrive, sheer bliss....

The not so good:
I lost a personal belonging and thought I may have left it in the room.  I rang the hotel the next day and was told that they would have to put me through to housekeeping.  I was kept holding for ages, so I hung up.  I rang back again and the staff member on the reception desk told me that he would have to get someone from housekeeping to ring me back..... That was 3 weeks ago and to date I have heard nothing.  As this was not an expensive or sentimental item I have let it go....but NOT good customer service.

The AWFUL:
Myself and my friend got a great rate, and booked a twin room. We were advised the room would be non smoking, as is the hotel.  This is fine as we are both non smokers.  We checked in and when we went to the room we felt it was a bit warm, so turned on the AirCon to cool it down before we went out for the night.  When we got back later, the room was stiflingly hot.  As it was quite late, we felt it was too late to see about being changed to another room, so we tried again in vain to fix the AirCon, but no matter what way we turned the dial, only hot air came out of it.   We then tried to open the windows, but the windows were neailed shut, as we had an interior view room....ie. a room overlooking the mezzanine and interior of the hotel.... So we both tried to sleep the best we could in a room with no air and it was awful. Neither of us got much sleep at all, and both of us are semi-claustrophobic, so you can imagine how distressing this was for us.

When we checked in (at different times) neither of us were advised that the room was an interior and there might be a problem with the heat/air con.  When we checked out the next morning we advised the staff member on the reception desk who said ""Oh, sorry about this, yes, sometimes the internal rooms can be warm""........ 
This ruined our stay in The Westin, after such an enjoyable evening in the city and after enjoying the ambience on the bar in the hotel.
My advice, make sure it's an external room you have booked, or else go somewhere else....",3,2009,12,02
202,okay,"I was at a function but do appreciate the central location of the Westin, howvere I really didn't think it was up to 5 star standard. Minor things like: no hairdryer in room, very few toiletries for use, no complimentary water, musty smell in room. On check in we were headed straight to finction, and weren't told what time breakfast was at, next morning found no detail of time in any of the room literature - headed down, only to be told at 10:04 that  breakfast was finished at 10:00am and we could eat in Atrium area. Nice food, but more like light lunch types, not breakfast-y at all, so quite disappointing.  
the food for the function again, was just ok, which I put down to the fact of ~150+ people there, but I would say that service was appalling, dreadfully slow..
Overall - hotel was okay, probably because we got a good rate because attending large function...don't think I'd be happy if I'd paid full price!! I have stayed in most of the hotels in dublin: shebourne, merrion, dylan and certainly found westin not up to this standard....",3,2009,11,22
202,"Great location, well appointed rooms","You can't really go wrong at the Westin in Dublin.  Typical Westin 5 star service in a great location in the heart of Dublin. 

Cab fare is about EUR22 (on a good day) from the airport, and is about 20 minutes without traffic. Beware though - it can be anything upto 60 minutes at the wrong time of day!  

Rooms well appointed, spacious and clean.  Bed extremely comfortable, and good size flat screen TV with numerous channels.  Check-in and check-out very efficient.  

Breakfast was taken in my room, which was excellent.  Lovely scrambled egg - just like my nan used to make!!!  Good selection of pastries and fruit was fresh.  And it arrived in the 15 minute time-slot I had requested - which is not necessarily the case at all hotels I have stayed in.",5,2009,11,20
202,Good 5* hotel,"Great hotel, excellent location, rooms very comfortable,staff great",5,2009,11,15
202,A Very Comfortable Stay,"I stayed at the Westin for a couple of nights and was very pleased with the attentiveness of the staff and the quality of the room.  Although my room overlooked Westmoreland Street it was very quiet. 

The room was larger than in a lot of 'chain' hotels, the bed was very comfortable and the bathroom was well appointed with both a shower cubicle and bath. There was no soap in the bathroom when I checked in but this was quickly rectified. There was a comfortable armchair in my room although this was not the case for a colleague also staying at the same time on the same rate. If you are a smoker (I'm not) then this is probably not the hotel for you as all rooms and areas are not smoking and there's a very hefty deep clean charge if you are found to have smoked in your room.

Breakfast is quite pricey at EUR 21 and that's only for a continental. 

Location wise the hotel is very convenient for O'Connell Street and Temple Bar. I'd recommend the Asian Orchid restaurant immediately across the road.

This is a hotel I would return to on any future trip to Dublin.",5,2009,11,14
202,Excellent Westin Dublin,"An elegant property right in the heart of Dublin. 
It was our home for 3-days towards the end of October.
A skip, hop and a jump away to Trinity College, Grafton Street shopping. Directly across Temple Bar where there are rows of bars and restaurants to enjoy.
Anita at the Front Desk epitomize customer service. She's efficient, friendly and seem to care, no pretenses. Although, everyone at the Front Desk seem to have done a great job.
Our room overlook Trinity College campus. The bed was luxurious and comfortable, bathroom was huge with a shower and a tub. It provided all the amenities and more. The chambermaid/s did a fantastic job with daily cleaning service.
Restaurant offered sumptuous buffet of Irish delights.
Spa service is simply divine.
Overlooking the fact that the fire alarm went off at 3am on our first night at the hotel (getting over our jetlag), the hotel is simply lovely.",5,2009,11,03
202,Not the best experience with a Westin...because of poor concierge service,"Went to Dublin to run the Marathon.  The Westin is indeed in a good location, and mile 1 of the marathon route passes in front of the hotel entrance, which allowed my family to cheer me on from a convenient location.  The hotel met all of our expectations of a Westin, with the glaring exception of the concierge's level of service.  For example, one of them gave me bad bus directions, and told me to walk half a mile to catch a bus, even though there was a better stop a block away.  Another one incorrectly told us that we would have to wait in line even if we bought on-line tickets ahead of time for the Guinness Storehouse tour (he was wrong, and luckily we checked the website, which not only allowed us to skip the long line, but also allowed us to buy tickets on-line at a discounted price).  How could a decent concierge not know that?!  On a third occasion, my wife asked whether a certain street had any shopping or sites, and the concierge said no.  She went anyways, and found tons of mainstream shopping and activities.  It really upset us that the concierge desk had such lack of pride in their profession.",3,2009,11,02
202,"Great Location, Comfrotable Room, Meets Westin Standards","I have stayed at a number of Westin's throughout the US and used Starwood Points to stay here for one night during my recent trip to Ireland.  The hotel is very expensive, and I probably wouldn't have spent the money on it, but it is in a great location has a posh feel to it, the beds are indeed Heavenly and the bathroom/shower/tub is lovely.

The staff was very helpful when I needed bus directions and when I actually forgot my room number (it was the third hotel I'd been at in 4 days and just blanked).  

Trinity is right there and you are at the very beginning of Temple Bar, a minute walk to Grafton Street and O'Connell Street.  There are more expensive hotels in Dublin and there are cheaper hotels, but this one is a good option in the mid-high range.",4,2009,10,30
202,"Lovely Hotel, a real treat","Lovely city hotel , in an excellent location. Staff are really great and very well trained. 
Food was lovely , we ate in their cellar bar and very happy with food and service.
Cant wait to return, Oh I nearly forgot, The beds are truly Heavenly!",5,2009,10,26
202,Great Hotel for a Trip to Dublin,"We stayed there using Starwood points and we were quite pleased with the Westin.  It is in a beautiful historic building that is well kept, and our room was cozy and well appointed.  The location is great, and I highly recommend grabbing lunch at the nearby restaurant GRUEL, which is fantastic.  Our only complaint is that the service was mediocre, but considering we stayed there for free using points, it didn't trouble us much.  I'd stay there again if I returned to Dublin.",5,2009,10,24
202,Center of Town,"The Westin Dublin is fabulously convenient to everything one wishes to see in Dublin and extremely noisy, most noticeably in the wee hours of the night.  This is due to being on one of the streets opposite the Temple Bar area.  We were there during the off season and even on weekdays there was revelry beneath us at 2 and 3am.  I counted about 4 wailing sirens one night.  Everything else was great.   Soaking tub was nice- read James Joyce in there when I couldn't get back to sleep.  Jet lag had a lot to do with that.  Beautiful breakfast buffet, but you are right down the steet from the famous Bewley's Cafe on Grafton.  Loved the ambience of the Mint bar down in the basement.  Trinity College is just across the street and you can see the book of Kells there as well as eat at the Buttery... which serves a nice inexpensive meal.  
Business accomodation are very good although we had a hard time with internet at this location.",4,2009,10,21
202,Where you want to be in Dublin!,"The Westin, located in an old bank building is situated right where you want to be - within walking distance of almost every tourist and shopping or business site in Dublin (you'll need a cab or city bus to the Phoenix Park).  The hotel is lovely.  The room was large enough and the service perfect.  The bed was the best thing after a long flight and certainly after a long day of sight seeing.  It is a perfect Westin.  The staff are knowledgeable and helpful.",5,2009,10,18
202,Great location but bait & switched on both stays,"My wife and I stayed at the Westin Dublin on the first & last nights of an 8 day vacation that we took driving around Ireland.  I was eager about staying at this hotel having read all the great reviews, and as SPG Gold individual had high expecatations.  Well, I must say the location is fantastic as others have pointed out.  But outside of the great positive of the location, there were just too many other issues that still resonate with me.  First, valet parking is 25 euros.  Unfortunately there is no real choice for self park nearby, so we were a bit handcuffed by their fee.  Second, I booked a KING size bedroom for both nights, but each time I was instead given very small QUEEN bedroom.  I complained both times and both times I was told that they did not have any remaining KINGS.  I even showed a printout of my reservation indicating the bed was a KING, but I was still turned away.  How could this possibly have happened?  I was never given an adquate explanation or provided with a resolution.  Third, I wasn't given a room on the Starwood Preferred floor with the extra perks (complimentary water, free paper, turndown service) even though I am Gold.  When I asked about this the front desk simply told me that they could bring me free waters.  This did little to appese us.  Fourth, my reservation also indicated atrium views of the interior of the hotel (looked beautiful from other member photos), yet we were given a view of construction at the ajacent building for our first stay.  Overall these factors left me with a negative impression of the hotel.  Besides the location, the service, the rooms, and the bait & switch tactics were all dissapointing and unpleasant.  On my next trip to Dublin I'm tempted to opt for the Shelburne.",3,2009,10,17

I arrived before the room was ready for check-in (I was really early) and the staff were really great getting me checked in, taking my baggage into storage for a few hours, and helping me figure out how to get to Temple Bar (it was Saturday so there was a great farmers market to try). The location was amazing - right next to Trinity College, Temple Bar, and near the top of Grafton Street. The rooms are all interesting - not cookie cutter at all since it is an old bank building. It was clean, luxurious, and had character. We had a drink at the bar one night in the old basement area - and they were doing swing dancing and music that was really nice. I didn't eat at the restaurants at all - but overall, it was a really great experience.",5,2009,10,08
202,Highly recommended,"We attended a business dinner at the hotel and stayed the night.  Excellent location, food and spacious and comforable rooms.  Everything you would expect from a five star centrally located hotel in Dublin and a little bit more.  

Had a cocktail in ""The Mint"" bar which is supposed to be a good place to hang out in Dublin at the weekends. It was a bit quiet but it was a Monday night.  Cocktails were good as was the decor. Young vibe about the place. 

Beds were really comfortable and there was no noise which is surprising given that the hotel is right in the center of the city.",5,2009,09,29
202,Excellent location; comfortable hotel,"I cashed in some Starpoints to stay here for five nights.  I doubt there is a hotel with a better location anywhere in Dublin.  It is across the street from Trinity College in one direction, and Temple Bar area in another.

The hotel itself is what you would expect from a Westin.  One thing I would say is that the concierges here are not particularly helpful.  They're not bad, I just wouldn't rely on them to provide you with restaurant / tourism advice.

One helpful item:  There are express buses from the airpot that drop off directly across the street from the hotel (not the Airlink buses).  Don't go to the tourist info desk at the airport to buy tickets.  Go straight out the airport doors and you can get tickets there.  Again, this is NOT the airlink or airpass buses.",3,2009,09,27
202,The staff here are great!,"All the employees we encountered at this central Dublin hotel really went out of their way to assist and to answer questions.  Front desk staff was especially helpful.  We had a few special requests, and they were all handled swiftly and cheerfully.  It made our stay there highly enjoyable.",4,2009,09,24
202,Excellent Hotel and Location!,"I utilized Starwood points to stay at this hotel, but if you have the budget to stay here it's absolutely worth the price. The location is perfect - you are literally steps from Temple Bar and Grafton street, as well as Trinity College (100 feet on either side of the hotel). O'Connell and Henry streets are about a five minutes' walk as well. 

We stayed in a deluxe room, so we had a little extra space, but the bathroom was larger than any I've had in Europe and the beds were very comfortable. TV and electrical amenities were up to par, and the staff were very friendly and helpful.  With the colder weather in Dublin, it was great to have heating and a/c that worked well. 

I can't say enough - hotel was great and made the last leg of a long trip very relaxing!",5,2009,09,15
202,Comfort and Location,"I am picky about where I sleep.  I stayed in a room with a queen bed which overlooked Trinity College on the third floor.  The room was spotless.  The sleeping area is a bit on the small side but since it was just me, it was fine.  The bed was VERY comfy, the decor was lovely and the temperature of the room was easily regulated.  The bathroom was large with a large tub and seperate shower.  That tub was a godsend after a long day of touring the city. The in-room coffee/tea maker helped me get going in the morning.  This hotel became my temporary home away and I loved my stay here.

This is a beautiful hotel and the staff made me feel welcome.  They were all very helpful each time I bugged them with one of my questions.  If I go back to Dublin.  There is NO question that I will stay here again.

Location:  As far as I'm concerned, you cannot beat the location of this hotel.  Walk out the front door:  to the left (2 blocks) is Grafton street with fabulous shopping and the St Stephen's Green Park.  to the right is O'Connell street where you will meet most of the tour busses in the morning (about a 3 block walk).  Across the street is Fleet street which takes you into the Temple Bar area roughly 2 blocks down.  The airport bus Air Coach makes regular stops just across the street and other tour busses stop 1 block away in front of Trinity College.",5,2009,09,13
202,Great Location But Not very helpfull Front desk!,"We stayed for three nights. On arrival we experienced problems with our booking. We wanted to contact the travel agency in Dublin who made the booking but the front desk was not prepared for to assist us in contacting them. We were just told to sortout the problem with he agency. Not very helpfull staff. 
Great location.  Restaurant was closed in the evenings - they refered us to the bar for supper. Rooms was ok.",3,2009,09,11
202,Seriously my favourite hotel in the world,"From the second you walk in the door, you feel like you're escaping from the craziness of College Green and Temple Bar and into a sumptuous relaxing place. The staff made every moment of our anniversary weekend special - we were also married in the Westin and the staff are incredible.  Beautiful function rooms and amazing, if expensive, hotel bar downstairs.",5,2009,09,08
202,Top Notch!,"An absolutely TOP NOTCH hotel. I‚Äôve never experienced such amazing customer service! After only a brief exchange with Marlene Buckridge, the Events Manager, I wish I could have an event there just to have her plan it! The rest of my staff encounters were all wonderful as well.
I booked the Classic room each time and both rooms I stayed in were beautiful. They overlooked the atrium, which gave me plenty of light. The bed and linens‚Ä¶ wow! When they say ‚ÄúHeavenly Bed‚Äù, they mean heavenly!!! The bathrooms with big tubs‚Ä¶ sigh.
I had a few meals via room service and was not disappointed. Even used the workout room, which I found kind of dark, but supplying everything I wanted. 
As a fresh off the plane traveler, first time in Dublin, I can‚Äôt imagine being happier anywhere else. This place put my trip off to a great and relaxing start.
I‚Äôm ready to move in!",5,2009,08,29
202,I wish I could live there..,"We stayed at the Westin Dublin both and the start and at the end of our Ireland trip.  We arrived in Dublin after an overnight flight from the US and went directly to the hotel.  We did not expect our room to be available since it was just 8am but the front desk staff assured us they would try to check us in as early as possible.  With that, she took our bags, gave us a map of the city and suggested numerous places to grab breakfast.  By the time we got back to the hotel after breakfast and walking around a bit, our room was ready with our luggage already in it.  And, it was just after 10am.   The room was very nice and very updated. 

At the end of our trip, after driving around the country we checked back into the Westin Dublin.  Just as great of an experience as the first time.  Room was very nice and again very updated.  The bathrooms were spacious and I fell in love with the toiletries they had there. 

I have nothing but positive things to say about the hotel and the staff.  I would definately recommed this hotel and if I get the chance would absolutely stay there again without hesitation.   It was a great location too!",5,2009,08,28
202,"Outdated decor, unfriendly reception",We stayed here for 3 nights.  The bathroom and decor looked much better in pix.  They are in desperate need of an upgrade.  We stayed in a deluxe room.   We initially checked into a room with a strong cigarette odor.   The receptionist grudgingly moved us into a room on the second floor facing the main street despite requesting a quiet room.  We then changed into a smaller room on the 5th floor.  The concierge was friendly but not very knowledgable.  This hotel should not be a 5* and looks and feels more like a 3+* hotel.   We travelled to 6 countries in Europe this July and this hotel was by far the worst place we stayed in.  It is way too expensive for what it offers.,2,2009,08,18
202,Great Location,The location was excellent and the hotel was very nice.  I would definitely recommend staying here.,5,2009,08,17
202,Great Place,"We stayed at the Westin Dublin for six days starting July 23rd, 2009. The hotel was clean, the staff were great, and the room was nice and comfortable. We have no complaints. It is located in a perfect location right across the street from the Temple Bar District where the shops and pubs are. It is walking distance from most of the Dublin attractions. We would stay here again if we returned to the same area.",4,2009,08,04
202,Central Location -- OK Stay,"My partner and I stayed for three nights at the beginning of a two week trip to Ireland.  I'm a gold level Starwood Preferred Guest and usually try to stay at Starwood properties. While the Westin was comfortable, we might very well consider another hotel in Dublin on our next trip to Dublin.  

While the best feature of the Westin is its location--right across from Trinity College and steps away from Grafton Street, Temple Bar, and the river--the truth is that central Dublin is really quite compact.  Unless you don't like to walk at all, most of the better and highly rated hotels are within easy walking distance of just about everything.   

The Westin is a boutique-style hotel in an old converted bank building, and this probably explains why, as other reviewers have commented, everything about the the hotel seems hidden away.  The Mint Bar is in the basement, the restaurant is hidden off to the side of the entranceway, and the small atrium with another lounge area is up one flight of stairs.  It's easy to not see any of these as you walk through the entrance and lobby to the elevators.  I made a point of going down to see the Mint Bar, and, frankly, didn't find it attractive since there were no windows or natural light.  With Ireland's long summer days (rain or shine), why would you not want to have a view outside while sipping a libation?

PLUSES:
1) Location -- Aircoach airport shuttle stops right outside the hotel.
2) Quiet, comfortable average-sized rooms.  Traditional decor that differs from Westin's usual modern style.  Westin's Heavenly Bed, however, is a mainstay.
3)  Breakfast buffet offering an elegant assortment of cereals, pastries, irish breads, cheese and cold cuts, and hot dishes.  Quality was remarkable!
4)  Complimentary PC internet access in the business center.  Expensive wireless access elsewhere throughout the hotel.

MINUSES:
1)  Breakfast environment is quiet--almost subdued.  Our breakfast was included in the room rate; otherwise, it would have been a whopping 27 Euros (approx $40/person).
2)  Westin Workout room barely worked!  Four out of six machines (treadmills, rower, cycles and cross-trainer) were malfunctioning in some way.  After alerting the front desk on my first day, nothing was different by our third day.

Given that everything is expensive in Dublin, the Westin, in my opinion, provides questionable value.",3,2009,08,04
202,Center of it all,"Excellent hotel. Clean and well staffed. Always able to answer our questions and went out of their way to ensure that we were well taken care of. Room was average size but plenty for two people. The bathroom was large, clean, and well stocked with robes and plenty of soaps/lotions etc. The location was key. We never walked more then 10 minutes to all the major sites. Will definitely return.",5,2009,07,28
202,"Very pleasant stay, AWESOME location!","This hotel was worth every penny. It was very clean, the location could not be beat and the staff was very accomodating. I traveled with my two sons (14 and 16) and we had two singles with a rollaway...all beds were very comfortable, even the rollaway!

Hotel restaurant is somewhat pricey, but quite frankly, anywhere trendy and delish in Dublin will be. 

Would definitely stay here again.",5,2009,07,27
202,I'd move in if they'd let me!,"We were thoroughly tickled with our stay at the Westin Dublin.  The staff were exceedinly helpful on a number of requests both relating to and not relating to the hotel itself, going out of their way on more then one occasion.  The bed and pillows were just a delight to fall into at the end of the day.  We slept wonderfully.  The room was the basic 'Double/Twin' and yet amazingly spacious for a european hotel and we felt right at home.  The bathroom had a tub and a shower both of which exceeded our expectations in size and water pressure.  It was very centrally located, an easy walk to almost all parts of Dublin.  And the price was quite competitive.  The only downside of a stay at the Westin I can think of is that its a hotel chain and not independent.  But I still think we got plenty of the Irish hospitality in our hotel!",5,2009,07,27
202,Great location and good quality hotel,The Westin is centrally located in Dublin City. It's a good quality hotel. The hotel has a car park but can be full very quickly. There's a very nice cocktail bar in the hotel as well. Highly recommend it.,4,2009,07,21
202,Fantastic location,"We had 3 nights at the Westin Dublin in a classic room.
Overall the stay was good but we had room only and did not use any of the facilities.

Check-in was not as smooth as I would have though from a Westin.  Yes, we arrived at 8pm but no one greeted us at the door and we bought in our own luggage.  The guy who checked us in was so pushy about getting us to join their Starwood Preferred Guest club that I wanted to swear at him. (We were member years ago but dropped it.)

Our room was on the first floor facing the busy street at the back.  Our view was of scaffold and construction so I instantly thought ‚Äònoisy‚Äô.  But I could not be bothered asking to move.  Surprisingly though, the room was quiet, with a little construction noise through the night but nothing to keep you awake.  The double glazing worked well.
Bed was comfortable and everything worked. Only complex item was the coffee machine which is the only way to boil water for tea but the plug has European points so you have to use the adaptor in the room to plug it in.  Yes, the adaptor is there for you to use, but they advise that if it is missing you will be charged for it.  Hence, as I like a cup of tea in the morning before heading out you either have to pack everything away or be charged (and trust me it appears on the bill if you dont put it back!).

The mini bar also is sensor controlled so if you don‚Äôt wish to pay the exuberant prices for drinks and put one of your own, you are charged for this on the bill too.   Thankfully, after a discussion upon checkout my 50 Euro bill from the mini bar and power converter was dropped.

Our bathroom was enormous and beautifully presented with lovely toiletries.  Only thing is, for a bathroom that is as big as a spare bedroom the shower would not take someone over 100kg.  It would be about 80cm by 80cm.  I mean, I am tiny, and I struggled to move without hitting my arms on the walls/glass - dumb!

I cant comment on the bars and restaurants as we didn‚Äôt use them.  Why would you when Temple Bar is across the road.  It is strange though as they all seem to be hidden away.  The bar is downstairs seemingly under street level, the ‚Äòatrium‚Äô coffee lounge is surrounded by rooms, and the restaurant is off to the side of reception, so guests are hardly encouraged to become passing traffic users.

A few reviewers have said the Westin is expensive.  Were you in Dublin?  Did you eat or have a beer?  A panini and coffee is around 10 Euro.  2 beers around 12 Euro.  Dublin is expensive!  Compared to that I found the Westin cheap - although we did book and pay before we left Australia and through Expedia.com so we got a good rate of about 400 Euro for 3 nights.

The location, as other reviews have said is fantastic.  Less than 5 minutes walk to anywhere.  The green airport bus goes from O‚ÄôConnell St outside the Post Office about 10-12 minutes walk away.  Its 6Euro pp one way and we used this on the way back and it was good.

All up, the Westin is great for the location and I found the rooms very good.  The shower, although small, is good (although warning you are in Ireland so hotter means colder and colder means hotter in the shower!!), there is a safe in the room, heaps of English tv channels through Sky and the rooms are clean and quiet.  I would stay here again.",5,2009,07,19
202,Fantastic location - everything else just average,"This is a tough one to review as we had a horrible first night due to being in an oddly arranged room across the street from a large construction project, and the bed was not heavenly, but rather the worst bed we've ever had at a major hotel.  The bed was hollowed in the middle, severely sloped on both sides to the floor, and was so soft there seemed to be NO bottom.  Very very uncomfortable.  However, after complaining the next morning, we were switched to a much nicer room, away from the construction, and with two much better beds (we did have to sacrifice a queen bed for two twin beds).  The bathrooms in both rooms were adequate, but there was only one pedestal sink and a small shower, my guess would be 30x30.
   Now to the good things.  Location, location, location.  We have never stayed in a hotel more centrally located to what we were there to do (sightsee) than this Westin.  It is right across the street and down a 1/2 block from the entrance to Trinity College and the Book of Kells, three minutes in the other direction you are in the heart of Temple Bar, and two minutes going the other way you are at the bridge to Connelly Street.  The air coach with service to and from the airport picks up just across the street from the entrance.  We also saw a show at the Abbey Theatre and that walk was only probably 5-10 minutes.  The ease of getting everywhere and the fact that Dublin is such an enjoyabe city really compensated for the first room fiasco.",3,2009,07,16
202,Perfect way to end our trip,"great location, great room that is all that you would expect of a Westin.  Clean and well appointed, it was a great relief to stay here after the chaos of trekking around the country.  We enjoyed their afternoon tea service in the atrium and drinks in their bar with the live jazz band. 

My only non-raving review about this hotel is that there are no outward facing windows (the hotel is between two other buildings) so our room window was over the atrium - which was nice, and let in enough light, we just couldn't tell what the weather was like by looking out of our window.

Oh, there's no pool either, that was a bummer... but there's a gym at least.  I couldn't have been happier with the location of the hotel relative to Temple Bar and Grafton Street and Trinity College!",5,2009,07,14
202,Quiet hotel with great location,"Excellent hotel with great rooms -- internet slow/likely depends on where your room is in relation to wireless router.

Dinner suggestions not great/ found better on trip advisor.

Fantastic location!",4,2009,07,06
202,great hotel pity we could not stay longer,"We stayed in the hotel for just one night as we were attending a wedding elsewhere.
We literally fell into the bed and where gone a few hours later.
However, our short stay was excellent.  The rooms were spotless and very well fitted out and the beds were extremely comfortable.  The staff were very polite and friendly.  Next time we will stay for longer.  One of great things about this hotel is its location right in the heart of the city.",5,2009,07,04
202,good hotel great location,"i ahve stayed in th e westin dublin 11 times now. it would be my choice in dublin for a few reaqsons.  1)the location is second to none right in city centre, 2)the hotel is beautiful and completely to my tastes it is also very clean 3) this hotel does seem to be one of the cheaper 5 stars in dublin but still of a high enough quality. 4) most comfortable beds EVER.  however despite this the hotel isn't perfect my big problem is the staff. for the most part they are friendly but some of the receptionists are down rigt useless. even down to me having to advise one girl how to use the atm machine.  taking pre auths for 2,500 instead of 250..  giving me a twin when i booked a double.  sighing when you ask for a request. ask for a taxi you are told to wait outside and flag one yourself.  however once you get past check in the hotel is wonderfull. and i will stay here again i just hope they would sort the staff out",4,2009,06,29
202,Wonderful experience,"We arrived at 5:30 A.M. from our overnight flight and they were able to accomodate us with a room immediately.  The  room was comfortable, although not very large, the bedding ""heavenly"".  The bathroom was beautiful and almost larger than the sleeping/living area!  Top of the line toiletries, plush towels and robes were provided.  The location of this hotel is PERFECT.  Across the street from Trinity college, Temple Bar starts out the front door and best shopping streets are around the corner.  Many good restaurants to choose from in the area also.  We will stay here again on our next trip!  It is a higher priced property so look for a ""break"" before booking as I did!",5,2009,06,25
202,Beautiful hotel in the perfect location,"The Westin Dublin is a beautifully classic hotel in a great location for seeing all the sights of Dublin. The staff are all very friendly and knowledgeable especially Peter the doorman who is an absolute delight! Great food and cocktails in the Mint Bar and a beautiful Atrium for a coffee. The rooms are big enough, even the interior rooms have daylight from the atrium, with very comfortable beds. Bathrooms are spotless with lovely toiletries. I'll be back!",4,2009,06,18
202,"Incredible location, very comfortable hotel, very expensive","The rooms, and especially the beds, linens and pillows, are outstanding at this hotel. Also, the location is fantastic, as you can be at Trinity college in 1 minute. The service was pleasant. Breakfast was just okay. The major downside was the cost. This is a very expensive hotel, and what really irked me is that they charged me an extra 15 euro per day for internet access. No other hotel/guesthouse/B&B in Ireland charges for internet accesss. Seeing that someone accessing the internet doesn't actually cost them anything, I think it's out of line charge extra for it, after spending more than 300 euro per night for the room.",4,2009,06,18
202,Comedy of Errors or Just Because It's Expensive Don't Mean It's Good,"Unlike most people here in Tripadvisor land I did not enjoy my stay.  This is the most expensive hotel I've ever stayed and was the most trouble.  Second night there someone activated the fire alarm at 2am and instead of checking it out first management simply evacuated the entire hotel.  Fourth night there the security person visited my room twice for a TV turned on too loud.  I turned down my TV only to find out there was an unlabeled volume control for a speaker in the bathroom which was turned up all the way.  Other aspects of the hotel were nice.  Should I have realized what the control was for?  I don't know but it wasn't labeled.  Bottom line, my vacation was ruined because I never was able to adjust to the time change because of being disturbed so much.  Again, most expensive hotel ever and most trouble ever.  From now on I'll stick to three star hotels and leave places like this to people that find it worth it.  I don't think it was worth it.  Oh yes, small rooms compared to what I'm used to.  Yes, it is comparably priced to other 5 star hotels in the area.  Here the key is it was expensive and my stay sucked!",1,2009,06,15
202,Excellent & Classy Hotel. I wish we could've stayed longer.,"The hotel and service were magnificent, what you would expect from a 5 star hotel. My fiancee and I were only there for my birthday weekend so we didn't take full advantage of the hotel, but it was perfect for everything we needed. Highly recommend and the location was the best for any tourist type adventures.",5,2009,06,06
202,"Unbeatable location, beatable rooms","You really couldn't hope for a better, more central location. From the front door, turn right and in less than a block you're at the Liffey. Turn left, and it's a short walk to Grafton Street, Temple Bar, or Trinity. So go out and walk around - the rooms aren't anything worth staying in for. There was nothing wrong with it, especially. At any Westin, you can count on great bathrooms and comfortable beds. At this particular Westin, our room was so small, you had to turn sideways when you walked between the end of the bed and the dresser - very small and cramped. However, very quiet: through the dead of night from Saturday into Sunday (ah, jetlag), I didn't hear a sound from the street. The basement bar is pretty cool; used to be a bank vault I think. Food unremarkable, but service great. Finally, the Atrium looked like a great space to hang out and have a drink it - it was closed early-ish on Sunday evening when I got around to trying that. The staff were attentive and very polite. Overall, this is a really good place to stay, but I do think that for the money, you may be able to find a commensurate room at another place with a little more space and character.",4,2009,05,31
202,Would Stay Here Again in a Heartbeat,"My husband and I just returned from a 5-night stay at the Westin Dublin.  Location is ideal -- we basically walked everywhere, yet were never bothered by street noise or the crazy Temple Bar action.  AirCoach from the airport stops less than a block away, and picks up across the street.  Really, just made our stay in Dublin so nice.  Every (yes, every!) staff person we encountered was unfailingly polite, friendly, and helpful.   Just one example: when we wanted some walking directions to a pub I'd read about here on TripAdvisor, we were asking the concierge about it, but I blanked and could only remember ""it's a pub with a microbrewery and they have music some evenings.""  He was able to figure out (correctly) the name of the pub, the address, and give us directions.  Nice.  We stayed in a standard room, which I would describe as large by European standards.  Nice bathroom as others have mentioned with a separate shower and tub, sound system in the bathroom, and nice white tea bath products.  Room always made up well, and finished promptly.    Nice flat screen TV, very comfortable bed.  We had the breakfast included in our room rate, so we ate at the Exchange restaurant for breakfast each morning.  Holy buckets, that's an expensive breakfast if you're not getting a deal on it.  But, nice fresh foods (fresh fruit buffet, fresh breads, cheeses, smokied salmon) along with the typical breakfast stuff if you want that (bacon, omlettes, etc.).  Great coffee.    Also, we really liked going to the Atrium Lounge to relax with a drink after a day of sightseeing.  Beautful room, very nice service, great food.  We also tried the Mint Bar one night -- had a nice platter of a variety of appetizers that my husband devoured.  Interesting historic space, pretty dead on a weeknight.   My husband loved the workout room -- individual TVs on the machines for people to watch; he never had a problem getting a machine in the mornings.     To sum up: nice historic hotel with all the modern updates, perfect location, great staff.  Would most definitely stay here again!",5,2009,05,28
202,"Excellent Location, Elegant, would love to stay here again.","My colleague and I stayed for two nice and were VERY impressed. The lobby is magnificent and impressive and our respective rooms were refined and spotless (if not slightly on the small side). The bathrooms were a good size with separate shower and bath and very modern decor. The beds. The beds!!! SO comfortable we overslept both days, absolute luxury and the fantastic ""blackout blinds"" that I so love. 
A fantastic choice for breakfast (which was included in our room rate) arrived on time and was delicious. That was the only meal we at at the hotel, choosing rather to eat out in Dublin. 
The gym was small but perfectly sufficient, Kept immaculatley clean with fresh towels and water, I always managed to time it so that no-one else was there!
The basement bar was full of ""trendies"" we went a couple of times, there's an extensive cocktail menu worth trying, but prices are quite steep. All in all, loved the Westin and if the company were paying again would love to return!",4,2009,05,20
202,Fantastic stay,"What a lovely hotel, really sharp rooms, very friendly and helpful staff.  The business lounge has two computers for free use.  Perfect location.  Never ate at the hotel's restaurant, but many restaurants in the neighborhood (the Pig Ear's was great, 4 minute walk).  Would definitely stay here again.",5,2009,05,17
202,Our Dublin Home from Home,"We regularly stay in the Westin when we visit Dublin. Most recently over the first weekend of May. It is a beautiful hotel, well located and has a homely feel, to us anyway. 

First things first, the rooms are generally of a high standard as would be expected of a Westin. The views are not always great, try to get a high floor and the front of the hotel, although these may be all upgraded rooms. Toiletries have changed over time but they have always been of a high standard, with shampoo, conditioner, shower gel and lotion always provided and restocked daily. Currently they have a White Tea range which my wife raved over. I love Westin's beds but that could be a personal preference. Loads of hangers in the wardrobe and both Irish and American sockets in the room. Some bad points, I think the Westin could stretch to free WiFi in its rooms and my wife would have liked room slippers which weren't there even though robes were provided.

Check in is always a pleasant experience and the concierge will take the time to help you with anything you ask for. One cautionary note, as with most Irish hotels the staff are generally not Irish themselves so you may need to be quite precise in your requests as misunderstandings do occur. 

We haven't tried breakfast or the Exchange restaurant so I can't comment but there are two good bars in the hotel. The Atrium is a great place for a coffee or an early drink. A relaxed luxury kind of space. Down in the basement the Mint Bar is a cool cocktail bar. It is expensive though for the prices you get table service and a great atmosphere.

As mentioned earlier, it is the location which makes this hotel so attractive. Moments from the party areas, the shopping areas and walking distance to all the main theatres and venues in Dublin. Whatever we are doing in Dublin, it always seems to suit.",4,2009,05,07
202,Great European Hotel,"Stayed at the Westin for 4 nights in mid January with my sister. We had a King room with an interior view. While the room didn't have any ""natural"" light it didn't feel stuffy. I occasionally get hot though and it would have been nice to be able to open a window. The bathroom was spectacular. Great tub with separate shower, it felt very large for a hotel bathroom. Two separate closets and a nice desk area. The location can't be beat. Right in the heart of Dublin but far enough removed from Temple Bar to not have to deal with that mess. Within walking distance to everything but also close to the Tara Street station if you want to take the train to the coast. Ate twice in the hotel and was pleasantly surprised, expensive but not outrageous and actually pretty good. The staff was friendly but the concierge didn't seem that knowledgeable. Would stay here again.",5,2009,05,04
202,Classy retreat in centre of city,We stayed for three nights before driving throughout the south and west for a week.  It was then great to return for one last night before leaving Ireland.  The rooms were very comfortable.  Both rooms overlooked the atrium so street noise was not an issue.  Our welcome to the hotel was outstanding.  The staff took time to explain all the features and how to easily access all the facilities.  Very central to all inner city attractions as well as bus and taxi options.,4,2009,05,03
202,Greatest hotel that I've stayed at in Europe....,"I spent six nights there in April 2009.  Standard double room overlooking Trinity College.  Large bath with separate tub and shower.  Veruy ""COMFY"" bed.  Spacious room.  Extremely courteous and honest staff (We accidently left the safe unlocked one day and nothing was missing!).  The largest hotel elevator I have seen in Europe.  Excellent location. Almost everything is a short walk -- Trinity College, Grafton Street, Nassau Street, Connoly Street, Henry Street, St. Patrick's, Christ Church, Connoly Station, Hop On - Hop Off Busses, Temple Bar, Brazen Head and many more sights.  This 5-Star hotel priced out cheaper than 4-Star hotels I have stayed at in Rome, Paris and Prague.",5,2009,05,01
202,Very nice with a few small reservations.....,"I can't really fault this hotel; the location is fantastic ( pretty much anywhere of interest is a walk away ), the staff were friendly and helpful, my room was spotlessly clean and large enough for me.

My small gripes are the lack of an alarm clock, I had to call front desk every evening to arrange a call for the following morning - not a big deal but got annoying after a while - and while i didn't eat in the hotel restaurants, I had room service once or twice and the food was alright but then it was room service after all but yet was somehow disappointing. There are plenty of restaurants nearby though. 

Otherwise it was very nice and I'd definitely stay again.",4,2009,04,28
202,With some work could be a better hotel,"I stayed at this hotel in Dublin, Ireland on April 2nd and again on April 8th. About a week before arriving for the first time I called and requested an early check as I was arriving at
 about 10am after flying all night. I know early check in is a request and not guaranteed, but I was quite annoyed when the front desk clerk had no record of my request. They don't seem to do any maintenance with the filters in the room as I had to call and have the room checked as it was so warm. They pulled out the filter and there was an inch of dust and debris on it. Disgusting. The hotel itself was so stuffy and hot you couldn't bear to be in there for more than a few minutes. And no alarm clocks. What hotel in this day and age doesn't have clocks for it's guests? They also had signs posted for a gift shop which doesn't exist. I went around the hotel looking for that. Will not stay here again.",3,2009,04,22
202,Lovely old hotel next to Trinity College,"My teenage daughter and I stayed at the Westin Dublin while visiting Trinity College.  It is a beautiful old hotel.  We arrived early afternoon and our room was ready.  We had a deluxe twin with a street view.    We had been upgraded as Starwood Members so had expected something on a higher floor or a bit larger.   The room was comfortable however and we thought the beds were great.   The rooms have the original windows which I find very charming, but it did mean there was some street noise.  As others have said, this hotel is about location.   We were in and out several times and day and we walked to all the historic sites. Very convenient.  We did not eat in the hotel.  I would return again for the location and because it is a good clean hotel.",4,2009,04,20
202,Good thing we brought our confirmation papers...,"We stayed at the Westin Dublin in April 2009, for 4 nights over Easter weekend. For starters, we arrived at the hotel after 15 hours of air travel from the US, to find that our reservations we had made through their online website did not exist! Good thing we had our confirmation papers with us, but even better, when given the confirmation code on our printout, they still had no record!!!

We booked online via their website, with an excellent deal of 107 Euro per night, for two people in a standard deluxe room.  If we had not brought our receipt from our reservations online showing this, lord only knows what kind of rate we would have gotten from them at the desk! Going rate is around 199 Euro per night.

We had a room facing the atrium, so it was nice and quiet.

Hotel room is nice for Europe standards, nice big bathroom, separate shower and bath tub, however our tile and grout in shower looked liked it needed a good scrub, thought we saw some stuff moving on there!!! The beds are queen size and hard, so if you are into that right on, you get 5 pillows, kind of lumpy, but they get by. 

Flat screen tv on wall with about 20 channels or so. Free coffee pot and coffee in room, bathrobe (only 1????), hair dryer, safe, etc. 

The staff is overall friendly and willing to help out. Rooms cleaned well on time. Fresh linens and towels when requested.

This hotel is about LOCATION though. This is the best location to check out everything in Dublin. The aircoach from the airport will drop you off about a two min walk from the hotel, and you get picked up from across the street. Trinity College is next door, Grafton street 5 min walk, O'Connell St 5 min walk, Christ Cathedral and St. Patrick Church are 10 min walk. The DART station is 7 min walk. 

The hop on/hop off bus tour has stops 2 min away from hotel. This is the way to go, buy a Dublin pass with the bus pass online to see all the sites, bypass the long lines as save money!!!

There are a TON of places to eat right by the hotel. Do not bother with the hotel food, WAY over priced. Go to the Bad A** Cafe, or Elephant Cafe 3 min walk and get a great Irish Breakfast for 7-10 Euro. 

Overall, not too bad. There were definite issues, but the GREAT location makes up for a lot of it.",4,2009,04,17
202,A high price for a super location,"The location is the main selling point for this hotel - right in the heart of the city, minutes from Grafton Street, Trinity College and Temple Bar. My husband and I could not help be slightly disappointed with the level of service and comfort that this 5* hotel had to offer, particularly considering the price we paid for the room (without breakfast). In summary, the room was comfortable although nothing special. The bathroom had good facilities, but could have been cleaner and we were let down by towels not being replaced on two occasions. We were disappointed by the concierge staff who failed to confirm our restaurant booking, however, we were impressed by the quality of the food when we did eat.! All in all we had a great weekend in Dublin but the hotel was nothing to write home about.",3,2009,04,14
202,Ideal location,"Ideally located, gorgeous hotel in a converted landmark building. I was on a 30th bday trip to Ireland where I was going to spend the first few days alone before my boyfriend joined me, and I am so glad I ended up at the Westin because a full service hotel with a nice bar and restaurant, adjacent to Temple Bar was perfect for solo travel. I often travel for work and will stay at a Four Seasons or a Ritz. Typically, I do not pay for luxury hotels during vacations, however, I managed to find a fantastic rate days before my trip - which is the main reason I ended up there as opposed to the Radisson. My one critique would be that the room is small compared to an American Westin.",5,2009,04,08
202,Funky Hotel in the center of Dublin - Building used to be a bank...,"Stayed in this hotel 2 weeks in November 2008. Nice, Plush, centrally located. Good restourants.  Small (but nice) Gym.  Rooms are on the small side. Good experience",4,2009,04,07
202,Great location if this fits your budget...,"My husband and I stayed here along with my mother and her husband.  200 euros per night is usually above our budget but I didn't make any of the plans for this long weekend in Ireland.  We were only staying one night, anyway.

The staff was super friendly.  The concierge even helped me find the name of a bar I remembered from my last visit in 2003.  The maps they have at concierge aren't very good though.

The room was spacious and comfortable.  Just what you would expect from a westin.  And the location really can't be beat. It's JUST across the street from the Temple Bar area and Trinity College.",4,2009,03,17
202,Excellent,I was working with colleagues at Trinity College and booked the Westin Dublin for three nights for the location and also based on previous reviews.  By pre-paying the room I saved a considerable amount on the rate.  The hotel is first class in every respect.  The bed was as comfortable as my own at home and the room was very quiet.  I will absolutely stay here again.,5,2009,03,16
202,Great hotel but a little on the expensive side!,"An over night stay.

The hotel lobby is spectacular. It was my other half‚Äôs birthday. The hotel very kindly gave us a bottle of champagne on the house and a lovely note welcoming us to the hotel.

The room was a little small although we had been upgraded. The bathroom was lovely, separate bath and shower. Our room also had a balcony but the door did not open, I assume this was down to the fact that it was on the roof of the building. 

Unfortunately the main restaurant had closed so we did not get to eat there however breakfast was served in there in the morning. I could not fault the breakfast, as lovely as the surroundings. 

There is a bar downstairs which was very trendy they did also serve food. 

The hotel is very central so it is only a walk to the local shops. On another note the bus that takes you to the airport stop directly outside this hotel much better getting this than paying 50 Euro in a taxi!!",4,2009,03,03
202,"We loved the Westin, its staff and the perfect location!","I just spent four nights at the Westin Dublin with my 16-year-old daughter. This is one of only two or three perfect hotel experiences I have had in my travels. First of all, the location can not be beat. It's next door to Trinity College and a VERY short walk to O'Connell Avenue, Grafton Street, Temple Bar and Nassau Street. The hotel is beautiful and homey, and the staff are universally excellent. Our room had two twin beds and was quite large and comfortable. The marble bathroom had a tub and separate shower. Every time we returned to our room after sightseeing, our room was clean and beautifully made up. The concierge was happy to make reservations for us and just like every other employee we encountered, he was so very nice and so competent. I can not think of one thing I would like to change about our experience. We did not eat at the hotel, so I can not comment on the food. The Mint bar downstairs is quite a hot spot with well-dressed young locals on weekends. I would heartily recommend this hotel and I will definitely stay there again!",5,2009,02,23
202,Fantastic Location,"The location of this hotel is fantastic.  Eveything you want to do and see is walkable from here.  Westin Hotels ""heavenly beds"" are the best.  The staff is knowledgeable and extremely helpful.  I love the foyer with the fireplaces and the Mint Bar - which used to be a bank vault.  My only suggestion, would be to go out for breakfast if it is not included in your stay - you can get a meal about 20 Euros cheaper if you eat outside the hotel.",4,2009,02,19
202,Location + Service + Amaizing building + the best Hotel Bar,"I love this cozy Hotel. The rooms were really nice and comfortable. The Mint bar at the Hotel is awesome. It is super well located, a few blocks from Temple Bar streets and a walking distance from other Dublin attractions.",4,2009,02,19
202,Great location!,"Booked this hotel for a weekend away on the hotel website, as they were offering 3 for 2, which made this great value for money.  We got the aircoach from Dublin Airport and the hotel is a 2 minute walk from the bus stop.  We couldn't fault the location of the hotel - across the road from Temple Bar, yet no noise; 2 minutes from Grafton Street and from O'Connell Bridge.  Room was very nice, although no view.  We had one meal at the Mint Bar, but drinks are very expensive (12 euros+ for a cocktail!).  Breakfast was also expensive and service was slow (does it really take 20 mins to prepare muesli?), but staff were very attentive and friendly.  Would definitely recommend this hotel and have no hesitation staying here again.",4,2009,02,17
202,excellent location evn better staff,this was my third visit at this hotel in the last year.  the location and standard of the rooms are excellent. i would highly recommend this hotel as it is the staff  at that hotel that makes this hotel a real 5 star hotel.,5,2009,01,18
202,Nice Hotel,"Stayed in the Westin over Christmas for 2 nights. Arrived on Christmas eve and left on the 26th of December. We booked it on Lastminute.com under the secret hotel but it was pretty easy to figure out that it was the Westin so got a really good deal. I wouldn't have booked it for the full / normal price. And for the price I paid I was happy. Maybe I'm too picky but I cannot say it was fantastic, just good. But I'm the type of person who appreciates unique hotels with old world charm and character and not so much the service. The rooms were nice but my partner thought they were bland. Don't think they were bland, just impersonal which is the norm in big chain hotels anyway and a lot of people seem to appreciate it (I don't). Anyway I have nothing bad to say about the hotel. Our room was overlooking the atrium and didn't have much daylight as other people have pointed out. The only complaint I have is that when we checked in we were given a leaflet with the opening times for the Restaurant, the Mint Bar and the Atrium Lounge, it being Christmas, which meant these weren't the usual times. It stated that the Mint Bar would stay open till midnight on Christmas Day. We went there on Christmas Day and the barmen closed the bar much earlier (10ish). Some of the customer kicked up a fuss (we were just observing the whole thing) and asked to speak to the Manager. The Manager arrived and told the guys behind the bar to open the bar again. We spoke to a couple of barmen and they said that they had been previously told that the bar would be closing at 10pm and that's why they closed the bar - it made them look really bad but it wasn't their fault and they were obviously and understandably not happy. That happened again about an hour later because the Manager had told them to keep the bar open for another hour. So the customers kicked up a fuss again... and asked to speak to the manager again. In the meantime the night duty manager had started and the manager they spoke to previously had left. So the new manager told the guys to open up the bar again....!!! It made the poor guys behind the bar look really bad and I felt sorry for them cause they were just following orders from management. There was obviously a complete breakdown in communication between the bar staff and the management for some reason. It didn't bother me personally too much but at the same time did make them look like a bunch of amateurs instead of a professional 5* hotel. Other than that everything was fine. If you like the room on the photos (standard room) and like nice service (I hope this is not the norm in the bar and only happened because of christmas time) you'll probably like this hotel. And it is a very good location indeed.",4,2009,01,14
202,Perfect location,"We booked a 3 night stay at the Westin Dublin because of its central location in City Centre Dublin.  We were not disappointed.  Easy strolls will take you to St. Stephens Green, Grafton Street, Temple Bar, and O'Connell Street.  Trinity College is directly next door.  A 20 minute walk gets you to the National Museum and 10-15 minutes more will take you to Phoenix Park.  An Aircoach stop is directly across the street from the hotel for a cheap (7 euros) and easy ride to the airport. 

The hotel itself is impressive but much smaller than we thought - perhaps 5 stories at most.  Staff was excellent at all times.  We would certainly return.",5,2009,01,11
202,Does not look like the picture!!,"What a major disappointment. Our two room suite was okay, but it does not look like the picture. We couldn't get anyone to help with our bags. The first day of five, the tea pot broke and we never got a new one. The room was never cleaned. We spent so much money and it was just a horrid experience. Best book somewhere else. I would not rate this as a luxery hotel. It is one step over a motel. Stay at the Shelbourne. We were lost and they were more helpful than any of the staff at our hotel. Westin charged us for a newspaper!! We paid for a suite and they couldn't even comp us a news paper. I went with the hotel based on these reviews. Hopefully, I can save another traveler looking for an upscale  hotel from being greatly disappointed. The food was expensive and horrid too!!!!",1,2008,12,18
202,"Right hotel, right location","I don't often get it exactly right the first time I visit a new city when it comes to hotels. This time was an exception. In terms of a hotel perfectly located to visit all of the downtown Dublin attractions and superb accommodations at a reasonable price, I got it right this time. Or, the Westin did.

First - getting there from the airport. There is no train to a central hub. This is a ""bus"" city.You can take the ""Airlink"" to Dublin, a short trip. (6 miles?) Everyone takes the bus to go everywhere, or so it seemed. Big ones that block a good number of photo opportunities. However, I took a taxi. I arrived on a Saturday morning. Not busy so the fare was 20 euro (with tip). The cab driver said it's busier weekdays and usually twice that. On the way back, I paid 35.

I was an early arrival, really early. No problem. The room faced the atrium on the fourth floor. Well-appointed, comfortable, and the bathroom was larger than I expected. I received an ""internet special"" price: the value was exceptional.

Might be worthwhile mentioning that the food was exceptional too. I haven't had a lot of luck lately with meals ""at the hotel:"" average food for high prices. The Westin's Exchange restaurant was expensive but worth it.

The central location of the Westin made the prime attractions literally right out the door: Trinity College, the Book of Kells, Grafton Street shopping street, the River Liffey, and the old ""Temple Bar"" section of Dublin. And St. Patrick's Cathedral (Cathedral District) was walkable as was Dublinia (Viking/Medieval section).  It may be important to some to note that while I was there, the Book of Kells was ""out"" having some kind of work done. Reproductions were in the display case and they only charged half price the admission price. Still worth seeing. Not sure how long they were to be ""out."" You can still see the Great Hall, which is quite impressive.

It appeared the number one activity in Dublin is ""having a pint at the pub."" Plenty of pubs, plenty of pints. My cab driver gave me the complete rundown of the best pubs including the price per pint. More information than I needed but illustrates how friendly and helpful everyone was during my visit.

Final notes on the hotel: the Westin Dublin was showing some signs of wear in places but not to the level of being irritating. The overall excellent experience with the staff and the hotel made these very few details ""not a factor.""  It was mostly in the common areas - the room was perfect.",5,2008,12,17
202,Good hotel but lousy suite.,"We booked a suite & were given two seperate rooms on the top floor. The small bedroom had no windows at all & the adjoining lounge had permanently locked ""windows"" that were directly above the Atrium restaurant & within the fully enclosed interior of the hotel. No access to fresh air or even a view of the street. Reminded us of staying once in a claustrophobic  interior cabin on a cruise ship.
After complaining at reception & a long wait we were given a conventional suite on a lower floor overlooking Trinity College.
The hotel location, staff, food & general facilities were otherwise up to 5 star standard & we would recommend the Westin but just be sure you don't end up in a room or suite like ours.",3,2008,12,15
202,Brilliant location - for shopaholics !,"Stayed a Friday night recently as we were attending a show in Vicar Street. Room only rate for standard double for around ‚Ç¨169 on the hotel website. Terrific city centre location - beside Trinity College and a minutes walk from Grafton Street - also a short walk in the other direction across the Liffey to O'Connell St & Henry St etc. Thanks to a previous review here on TA we had pre-booked the car parking which costs ‚Ç¨25 per night. Watch out for the set down area - it appears to be a very small taxi rank so space is at a premium. Check in and valet etc were friendly and efficient. I had requested the usual stuff in advance if available - free upgrade, quiet location, balcony etc and in fairness while we didnt get the upgrade we did get a top floor room with balcony partly ovelooking Trinity. But be warned the top floor rooms seem to be quiet small. The reception areas were bright and clean and the open fires (so rare these days) were really inviting. We didnt wat at the hotel as we had dinner reservations elsewhere and normally go to Avoca for the breakfast buzz. The hotel's Atrium Lounge is beautiful and a lovely way to end the night with a couple of nightcaps. For shopaholics (like my other half) this location is pure heaven. The standard room as already stated was small but immaculate with lovely bathroom and seperate shower. We were allowed a late check out to enable herself to do even more shopping and there was no hurry in collection the car or luggage even after check out. Concierge was extremely courteous and helpful. Would highly recommend but get a good rate !",4,2008,12,08
202,Top hotel in perfect location,"Spent a pre-Christmas weekend in Dublin and booked the Westin due to its luxury status and central location.  It didn't disappoint in either respect.  We had a fabulous weekend with friends, which was enhanced by this great hotel.  The staff were very helpful in every respect and the hotel was everything we had hoped for.  We had afternoon tea in the Atrium, which was fantastic, and the hotel's attention to detail was obvious -  right down to the linen table cloths!  Our friends were (kind of!) celebrating their 5th wedding anniversary and the hotel acknowledged this fact on a number of occasions - even sending a complimentary bottle of bubbly to their room!  Highly recommended.",5,2008,12,08
202,Quality Hotel with a Great Location,"My partner and I stayed at the Westin for a week while visiting Dublin. We both work in managment positions at hotels in New York City so we are perhaps more critical than others and see things others may not. Having said that, the Westin did not disappoint. The location is central to almost everything you want to do, we walked everywhere. The property itself is beautiful. When we were there it was chilly out and it was great to come in from the cold and see the fireplaces blazing in the lobby, it was very welcoming. The staff was attentive and helpful, with special mention of Victor the bellman who was so proactive it made us both wish we had him at our properties. The only reason it is a 4 and not a 5 is our room was not cleaned one day and we had to call for service when we returned at night . We also had an issue for a few days with the morning newspaper delivery. Those minor glitches aside, the property and staff make this a destination property when visiting Dublin.",4,2008,12,02
202,Excellent location,"Location, location, location!  This hotel was within walking distance of most tourist sites.  Just a short and easy bus ride to those that  were not.  The staff was always friendly and helpful.  The room was nicely decorated and very clean.   Overall we had a great experience.",5,2008,11,19
202,"Westin Dublin - Perfect location, nice stay, a bit pricey","We stayed at the Westin Dublin for four days, at the beginning of our two week visit to Ireland. The location cannot be beat - within walking distance to many major tourist sites, but not directly in the noisy Temple Bar area. It is still in a busy part of town, though, so some street noise is to be expected - ask for a high floor to reduce this. If coming straight from the airport, I recommend using the Aircoach bus service instead of a taxi - only seven euro per head, and it drops you off a short city block from the hotel. The staff were very friendly and helpful, although you shouldn't expect to hear too many Irish voices amongst them - the staff is very multicultural (a reflection of Dublin itself I suppose). We were able to have an early check in, which was greatly appreciated after an overnight flight from the States. Our Taste of Dublin room package included a hot breakfast each day, which trims costs and helps you get your day off to a quicker start. Under no circumstances should you attempt to drive in Dublin centre, unless you just have a masochistic streak or death wish. When leaving Dublin we took a short taxi ride to a Hertz auto hire, from which leaving Dublin was much easier, even in mid-morning traffic. We had a deluxe room, which was very clean, quite comfortable and plenty spacious for two people - I did not get a chance to see what any other rooms looked like but have heard from other reviewers that the ""standard"" rooms are rather small. But the deluxe room was fine, with a large bathroom including both tub and shower (and even a speaker with volume knob for the telly - nice touch). Really, the only negative thing I could say about the Westin was the cost - even though we enjoyed our stay, it is a bit on the pricey side (our package cost about 300 euro per night - roughly $450). Location, location, location I suppose. But if you are not being too cost conscious, it's a great place to enjoy a stay in Dublin city centre.",4,2008,11,15
202,Pleasant upgrade at the Westin,"My wife and I stayed at the Westin Dublin for 2 nights in mid-September the weekend of the Gaelic football final.

Upon arriving by car, we had some difficulty communicating to the staff (doorman, bellhop, valet) as their English was not too good.  Then upon check-in we were told that there was no room in the parking garage for our car that we tried to valet (we had to reserve that separately online - but we called Westin directly to book our room), and that they only had a room with a queen size bed (we reserved a king).

So pretty rough start...

After voicing our displeasure, the manager came and told us that they will find room for the car and that we would be upgraded to a two-floor suite.  

The suite was marvelous.   On the first floor, a spacious bedroom with a large bathroom, complete with a bath tub, shower stall and plenty of amenities. The bed was typical of a Westin with several pillows to choose from and a nice soft mattress.  The second floor, which you can enter from the floor above us as well, had a nice comfy living room with a couch and two love seats.  The floors were connected with a spiral stair case.   Both floors had large flat screen TV's with plenty of cable channels. 

We immediately ordered room service at around 10:30 pm since we were starving.and they delivered our food in about 20 minutes.  Pleasant meal.

The hotel is perfectly situated in Dublin right on the outskirts of Temple bar, a block away from Trinity College, and a block south of the Liffey.  Almost all the main sites in Dublin are within a 15-25 minute walk.  

The Westin also had a lovely central atrium with ceilings all the way to the roof.  In this area,  you can enjoy a drink or a quick meal.

Regardless of the English language issue mentioned above, all the staff we encountered were courteous throughout our stay.  

Would definitely go back to the Westin if and when we visit Dublin again.",5,2008,11,09
202,Excellent base to explore the city!,"We stayed at The Westin for 2 nights as a last minute short break to Dublin. It was my first time in Dublin and I was very impressed with the hotel and the city. The hotel is mainy occupied by Americans and is fully non smoking.

We arrived at Dublin airport at 8.30pm and I had rang the hotel a few days before to inform them we would be arriving late. They advise you to do this if you are arriving several hours after the check in time. 

We got a Taxi from the airport to the hotel which took about 15/20 minutes and cost 22 Euros. We also got a taxi back to the airport on our depature this cost 18 Euros. The rate is slightly higher at night and on a weekend.

When we arrived at the hotel we checked in very smoothly and the reception staff were very polite and helpful. The reception area is very nice with real wood fires and a wooden floor. We were offered an upgrade on our room to a suite for an extra 100 Euros per night. We declined as didn't think it was worth it for the amount of time we would spend in it.

We had booked a classic room which is the basic room. It was very nice. I asked for a twin room as I had read on trip advisor that these rooms are slightly larger. It was a good size with very comfy 'heavenly beds'. There was a LCD tv on the wall, a mini bar, desk, big built in wardrobe and a lovely marble bathroom. The bathroom was very clean and well decorated with a 'heavenly shower' (2 shower heads in 1).

The location of the hotel couldn't be better. It is just across the road from Temple bar where all the bars, pubs, clubs and restaurants are. There are many dining options in Dublin and we didn't eat in the hotel. There are pubs serving traditional Irish food, sandwich bars and the usual chain restaurants (Hard Rock Cafe, Wagamama etc!) The hotel is also next to Trinity College which is worth a trip if only for the architecture. We paid 8 Euros each to see 'The book of Kells' I felt this was the biggest waste of money, unless you're really interested in it. No photography or video is allowed inside and it was very crowded.

If you come out of the hotel and turn left, It is about a 3 or 4 minute walk to Grafton Street which is the main shopping street with all the usual shops: M&S, River Island, Office, Next etc! It is a pedestrian area with many street entertainers which are worth seeing. If you come out of the hotel and turn right, it is a 2 or 3 minute walk to the river liffey.

We went round the main tourist sights (Dublin Castle etc.) and found 2 nights was plenty of time to see what we wanted to.

Back to the hotel, although we didn't dine in the hotel restaurant we did spend an hour or so, both nights, in the hotel bars. In the centre of the hotel is The Atrium Lounge which has a bar and serves coffee and light food. Our room overlooked the Atrium and it is a pretty area. There is also The Mint Bar which is in the basement of the hotel. The hotel used to be an old bank and this bar is the old vault. The decor reflects this. The drinks are more expensive than in the pubs but the cocktails are well worth it. Most cocktails are 12-15 Euros which a pint of beer costing around 6-7 Euros. A small glass of Chablis wine was 10 Euros. Dublin is quite an expensive city so the prices are in line with this. I'm sure if you venture out of the main tourist area things would be cheaper but we enjoyed relaxing in the hotel bar after a busy day of sightseeing.

Overall, we found The Westin to be an excellent hotel and would definately return. 

If you have any questions please feel free to contact me",5,2008,11,02
202,Memories are made of this,"I booked the hotel for a little getaway for my husband and I on a last minute website not knowing what hotel I was booking, I had an idea it might be the Westin from the description and the price was very good so went ahead with the booking. When we arrived there was no parking available in the hotel so we had to park across the street but it wasn't a hardship. I presume if we'd booked with the hotel directly they would have advised of pre booking the carpark. On checking in, we were asked if we'd like to upgrade our room to a suite for an extra 80 euro. As we'd paid very little for the room we jumped at the chance and how glad we were when we did. The room was huge with a separate living room and opened into a gorgeous bedroom and bathroom. There were magnificent views looking into Trinity College. We went down to the Mint bar for a drink before getting ready for dinner and when we arrived back to the room the management had left us a bottle of champagne and a card saying they hoped we enjoyed our stay. We were very overwhelmed with the gesture. We'd booked Fallon and Byrnes for dinner which was also amazing and then we came back to the exchange bar for a drink. We ordered breakfast to the room for the next morning and cracked open the champagne. We felt very spoiled indeed. And what a breakfast the next day. Easily the nicest way to wake up on a Sunday morning in Dublin's fair city. We thoroughly enjoyed the stay and have joined their Starwood Preferred Guest scheme so we can hopefully start availing of some more nights there. We'll definitely go back. Hopefully very soon.",5,2008,10,15
202,Nice hotel with great location in central Dublin,"Stayed at the Westin Dublin for 3 nights in Oct 2008.  

Pros-The location is excellent-1 block from Temple Bar area (nightlife, restaurants, outdoor markets, shopping), and 2 block from O'Connell street (did not spend much time there but seemed to be a lot of shopping).  Lobby, hallways and rooms lovely.  the heavenly bed is just that-heavenly.   no ice machine, but concierge will bring free ice to your room upon request.  concierge provided directions and made hotel reservations for us.  they had a book of menus for us to review before they made us a reservation.

Cons-Did not seem to be turn-down service, which surprised me.
Also-this pertains to 3 Westins i have stayed in in Eurorpe-this hotel did not provide any toiletries other than shampoo/condidtioner/soap/shower gel/body lotion.  where are the cotton swabs, combs, toothpaste & brush, razor kits?  there is also no sign that says to call housekeeping ro request ameniities.    i am a gold spg member and was not recognized as such, nor provided a room upgrade or late checkout option.  this was disappointing.

did not eat or drink at the hotel so can't comment.  

live irish music at the palace pub right across the street from the hotel, even on sunday night.

for sightseeing-recommend visiting dublin castle, guinness storehouse, phoenix park, dublinia & viking world, and of course eating & drinking throughough temple bar area.",4,2008,10,15
202,Perfect city centre hotel,"I booked a night here for myself and my fiance. It was his birthday and we had theatre and dinner plans and a romantic night in a luxury city hotel seemed to me the perfect way to round it all off!

We weren't disappointed.  I went for a package that included a bottle of champagne and fresh strawberries and they were delivered as promised. Ripe and juicy strawberries and real Champagne, not sparkling wine, were there for us on return from our evening out.  

The room itself was a double, up on one of the higher floors overlooking one of Dublin's busiest street.s It was incredible- during the day we couldn't hear a thing! Nearly perfectly soundproofed and just as well, as we found ourselves in the very early hours of that night watching the drunken hoardes stumble out of pub and clubs searching for taxis and late buses while dodging speeding police cars, sirens and lights blaring along with the usual Dublin street scuffles and rows.

The Westin Heavenly bed is world famous and this one was no exception- deliciously comfy and made for languid lie-ins.  A beautiful warm marble bathrooms with seperate walk in shower and large tub comprised my dream bathroom and all completely spotless.  The Molton Brown toiletries were very nice.

After dinner and theatre, mojitos in the basement Mint Bar were required. Their cocktails aren't for the faint of wallet but worth it, especially if you can draw them out a bit! After an couple of hours or so, we made our merry way back to the fab room where we launched into the champagne and strawberries, a planned trip to the zoo the next day now completely out of the question. Next morning, lashings of steaming fresh cofee were required and after that the breakfast spread could be faced! It was great and we indulged in warm waffles with maple syrup and tons of fresh fruit.

Great location, wonderful rooms, friendly staff and surprisingly quiet, we're planning a return for the next birthday- mine!",5,2008,10,11
202,Great Meal,"A colleague had a surprise birthday party here for her partner in August and booked dinner at this hotel, it was a wonderful meal, the food was superb.  The staff were wonderful, very attentive and even organised taxis home for some of our group.

Higlhy recommend this for any occasion.",5,2008,10,10
202,Simply excellent stay at the Westin,"I had been looking for an opportunity to stay in the Westin for some time, and spotting a great rate on lastminute.com I found myself here on a Friday night. A small queue had formed at check-in as I arrived, but an additional desk was quickly opened and I had to wait no more than a few minutes to be checked in by a friendly member of staff. I declined the opportunity to upgrade to a larger room, but my standard queen room was wonderful in any case. I was impressed with the attention to detail and high standard of finish, the bathroom was spacious and elegant and the bed was one of the most comfortable I‚Äôve slept in. 

On the spur of the moment I decided to have a late breakfast in the Atrium after checking out (I was on a room only rate). This is a lovely space, quiet and relaxing and such a contrast from the hustle and bustle outside on College Green. Service from the sole member of staff on duty was impeccable, the latte was one of the best I‚Äôve had (and served with a plate of biscuits, a nice touch) and I was able to order some delicious pancakes from the breakfast menu even though I was a few minutes past the cut off. I read an interview with the manager of Le Gavroche in London recently where he said that good service should be discreet, based on eye contact and that the customer should never be interrupted ‚Äì the service here was all of that and more, and I spent a very relaxing hour and a half there with the Saturday papers. 

Overall I was delighted with my stay in the Westin ‚Äì recommended!",5,2008,09,22
202,Fantastic!,"The Westin is a fabulous polace in a great location!  The staff were incredibly helpful and plentiful.  Our  room was large, well appointed and spotless.  The Atrium Lounge is a very comfortable place for afternoon tea or cocktails, and they serve a very nice breakfast there.  The Mint, the bar/restaurant in the basement is very cozy and serves good food, but the service there was a little slow both nights we stopped there.  We had one morning's breakfast in the Exchange restaurant.  It was overpriced and not great.  We wish the receptionist had told us the Atrium served breakfast.  We discovered that on our own later in our first full day at the property.  We liked the breakfast in the Atrium much better.",5,2008,09,21
202,One of best vacations ever !,"I have always believed that it is NOT a hotel's number of stars that determine the level of service - it's the staff and their efforts.  The Westin Dublin staff members are excellent, some outstanding and deserve a rating of over 5 stars !!!

It was my first trip to Ireland, I traveled alone and had many, many questions, often several times a day.  Not once did any front desk staff or concierge make me feel like I was bothering them - all of them always greeted me by name and with an eagerness to help.

I enjoyed great service too, at the Atrium and Exchange restaurants.  

I'm a Starwood Platinum member and I've stayed at many different hotels.  The Platinum level doesn't guarantee good service - it's the individual hotel's management and staff members that determine the level of excellence that a guest receives.

Thank you to all the Westin Dublin staff for one of my best vacations ever !!!",5,2008,09,02
202,overrated,Great location. Staff gave me wrong information a few times. Laziness me thinks. They are not as friendly as other reviews make out and all not Irish which sort of spoils the Irish experience.,3,2008,09,01
202,Wonderful Experience,"Stayed at the Westin Dublin for a conference. We received wonderful service from all staff (especially Kieran). It is wonderful having personalized service whenever you went anywhere in the hotel, whether it was the restaurant, Mint Bar, Atrium, etc. 

I would recommend this hotel to anyone wanting to visit Dublin, especially if you are looking at this place for a small conference. Also, if you get to see the Presidential Suite...all I can say is WOW!!!

The hotel is very close to Trinity College (across the street) and within walking distance to St. Stephens Green, Grafton Street, many stores and restaurants.",5,2008,08,28
202,Top-rate hotel in Dublin,"We stayed at the Westin for a friend's wedding, and I must say, considering what we paid for the room, it was probably the best-value hotel I've ever stayed in.

The location is great - the absolute centre of Dublin, close to Trinity, Stephens Green, and all the shopping to be had in Grafton & Henry Street. Check-in was a little odd; they insisted on photo ID. As this was a domestic trip I didn't have a passport or drivers licence, so I promised to go get my drivers licence later, (but never did!) We also got offered a 4-pm check-out for the next day; really great!

The hotel really impressed me; they did a spectacular reception for the wedding couple, and the (very noisy) Mint Bar downstairs has a great cocktail menu.

Our room was very large, extremely comfortable, with great room service.

The buffet breakfast is famous in Dublin; just keep going up for more of whatever you want. I've had the buffet before as a non-resident diner, so it was great to have this feast included in the room rate.

In rip-off Ireland I'd expect to shell-out 350+ Euro for a room in this place, but it was a very reasonable 180 - great value for what we got. I lived in Dublin for 6 years, and I remember when this building was a bank - a theme they play on throughout the hotel.

Usually when we stay in Dublin we stay with family or friends. However the Westin would definitely tempt me back for a sneaky and luxurious week-end break on our own. Great spot.",5,2008,08,27
202,"Great hotel, great location","I can highly reccommend the Westin dublin, The location is ideal, across the road from the Temple Bar area, a block from the Liffey river, and very close to Grafton st and St Stephens green.
Also alongside the Trinity College. We also walked to Guiness factory from the hotel, about 20 minutes.
The rooms are well appointed the bed is amazing!!!, Very soft and comfy. The bathroom is great too, with seperate shower, marble etc
The staff are very attentive as are the concierge and bell men all very polite,
I parked our car in the valet 23 euros a day, with in and out priviledges.
We did not eat at the restaurant or bars, there is a lounge bar for tea and drinks on the first floor.
the gym is very nice, modern and well equipped.
All in all, well worth it and highly recommended
Restaurants:
Gruel
Avoca
Nude
elephant and castle
bewleys for coffee, grafton st
leon, coffee
queen of tarts
mulligans pub for Guiness
Fallon and Byrne market- amazing treats, breakfast coffee",5,2008,08,14
202,Great location and good experience,"We booked the Westin with our Starwood points due to a 24-hour layover.  We took the 748 from the airport and were at our hotel within 20 minutes.  The bus literally drops you off within a 5 minute walk.  The location is perfect- couldn't have asked for anything closer.  The college is down the street and across.  You could walk to the brewery, which is about 30 minutes.  The staff was great and went out of their way to assist us with locations and maps.  Our room was located on the first floor and overlooked the atrium.  The room was spacious, very comfortable and very quiet.  I enjoyed tea in the atrium which was very pleasant.  We really didn't have a chance to spend too much time at the hotel but would definitely come back here again.  There were several restaurants in the area all pretty affordable- depending on what you're looking for.",5,2008,07,15
202,great location excellent service,"Great experience overall!!!
The location was perfect and the staff were incredible to us. They really made you feel welcomed and went out of their way for you. The hotel and guestrooms are a bit small but still very manageable, plus you find that at most city hotels especially in European countries. I was so pleased I wrote a letter to the hotel upon my return praising the treatment we received while in the hotel. I would without question stay here again the next time I travel to Dublin as well as highly recommend it to friends, family or anyone!",5,2008,07,01
202,"Good Location, Poor Service & Tired Rooms","We spent three nights at the Westin Dublin 6/11-6/15.  We booked a jr. suite at the rate of $400 Euro plus tax per night.  The hotel is located near sites, shopping and the tram.  The location was perfect for our quick trip.

Unfortunately, the location isn't enough for us to return.  Service was slow to poor (room rate included bed and breakfast), rooms were tired and dirty.  The furniture was filthy...the table still had drink rings from previous guests.  The carpet hasn't been deep cleaned in years.  

The coveted atrium view was dark and claustrophobic.  The bedroom had no windows.  

The bathroom was spacious with a soaking tub, stand alone marble shower and one sink however no outlet for a hair dryer so we had to use the small desk in the living area.  There was a large closet and safe that easily fit two laptops and other personal items.  The in room glassware had lipstick from previous guests and was downright unsanitary.

On our first morning, we attempted to order breakfast and were told only one breakfast was allowed for two people.  It took three calls from management to resolve the issue.   Breakfast arrived almost an hour and half later and was missing various items such as juice, toast and had the most horrible smoked fish I have ever seen or smelled.   Breakfast on the following mornings was slightly better but still had one or two items missing.  On both evenings we ordered late room service only to be told the kitchen was closed (before the cut off time noted in the in room dining literature).  

Service at the Mint bar was terrible....there was a complete lack of customer service. On both occasions, we waited more than 30 minutes to be acknowledged and another 30 minutes for drinks to arrive.  

We find it hard to believe that this is one of the best in Dublin.  It is certainly not 4 or 5 star rather a standard 3 star Westin with 4/5 star prices.  Starwood management needs to review this property and bring service and amenities up to that of other Westin properties worldwide.  

If we return, we will choose another hotel.",2,2008,06,29
202,Good Hotel in Excellent Location,"This was a bargain break for us through a Lastminute 'Secret' Hotel deal.  Through the write up of the hotel it wasn't difficult to work out that it must be the Westin....

The first room allocated to us was on the top floor and was looking a little shabby, the bathroom in particular was disappointing.  The receptionist couldn't have been nicer about our request to move.  The next room was much better with a great bathroom - also Moulton Brown shower gel, shampoo etc rather than the Westin own make in the first room.  So well worth moving rooms.

The location was great, close enough to all the sights we wanted to see, with the bars and restaurants of Temple Bar just a minute away.

We would definately stay here if we were visting Dublin again.  

One comment I would make is Dublin is much nicer outside of  Friday/Saturday nights when it is over run with stag and hen parties. The sight of group after group of girls (most old enough to know better!!!) in pink cowboy hats and 'hen'  t shirts just became depressing - the Wednesday and Thursday nights were still really busy but without these large groups a much nicer experience.",4,2008,05,27
202,excellant location,"hotel location is excellant,  was a bit disapointed with the rooms not great very small and simply furnished.  we were at the bruce concert and went bact to the mint bar which is below street level service wasnt great!!",3,2008,05,26
202,Nightmare with a car,"Clean, comfortable, luxurious hotel - no problem if you arrive by taxi or on foot.  Try arriving by car and it is a nightmare.  Firstly you can't get parked.  The road is very busy and there is a taxi rank just outside the hotel entrance.  Double park if you dare or even try the footpath.  Porters no where to be seen so carry in your own luggage.  Park your car in an independent car park as the hotel's small car park is full.  Retrieve your car in the morning and take about 20 minutes getting back to the hotel for your luggage through Dublin traffic and the notorious one way system.  On check out, be charged E10 for an adaptor which you never ordered and which you didn't even know was in your room.  Run up to your bedroom, locate adaptor, and bring to reception to have the E10 charge refunded.  Check your bill and find there is a donation for charity.  Have this refunded too, if you are bold enough to ask.  Starwood's interest in UNICEF is wonderful so why not take the donation out of shareholder profits rather than from the customer?  There must be better ways to run a luxury hotel than this.",3,2008,05,20
202,"Outstanding service, perfect location","As Dublin is a city with adequate but not particularly convenient public transportation, I consider it more important to be centrally-located here than in other European capitals.  Fortunately, The Westin is the best address in town!

From DUB airport, you can take bus 748 to O‚ÄôConnell Street.  Then it‚Äôs a five minute walk south across the river‚Äînot difficult, but also not something you would want to try in the rain.  The return trip is even more convenient.  The AirCoach (a private bus line) picks-up directly across the street from the hotel (in front of Boyle Sports).  The fare for each is quite reasonable:  ‚Ç¨7 one-way.

Upon entering The Westin, I was greeted by the doorman, then the porter, then reception.  It was friendly and professional yet unobtrusive and without the unnecessary small talk.  In fact, the service throughout my three-night stay was outstanding.

I stayed in a Classic room that was large by European standards.  As expected, the room had a comfortable bed and nice furnishings and was very clean.  Because this is a Starwood property, hotel literature covers just about every flat surface, to the extent that it becomes an annoyance.  The bathroom is nice‚Äîno shortage of marble or space.  The closet also had plenty of room, certainly adequate for two guests.  A sofa would have been a nice touch, as the room could have easily accommodated one.

I did have a few complaints‚Ä¶  Internet access costs (approx.) ‚Ç¨15/day, and while this is not unreasonable for Europe, mostly luxury properties in Dublin offer free Internet to their guests.  Second, the thermostat wasn‚Äôt too effective, and unfortunately there is no means for fresh air, as the windows don't open in Classic rooms.  Finally, if you want an alarm clock, you'll need to bring one with you.

But these inconveniences were minor, and overall The Westin is an excellent property.  While there are other nice hotels in the Temple Bar area (The Clarence, Brooks Hotel, The Morgan and The Morrison to name four), for both its ideal location and outstanding staff The Westin is my favorite.",5,2008,05,19
202,Nice hotel..with one small omission,"I agree with most of the other reviewers - this is a very nice hotel.  It's in a great location if you want to be near the Temple Bar area, Trinity College (with the Book of Kells - underwhelming) and the bottom of Grafton Street shopping.  

Rooms are standard high quality Westin - Heavenly beds, nice furnishings, etc.

A couple things to note:

1.  There are NO clocks in the rooms, aside from one built into the TV which turns off when you turn the TV off.  So bring your travel alarm clock!

2.  The showers are small.  I was in two different types of rooms - a ""Deluxe twin"" which is an upgrade from standard with much more room, and a King room.  Rooms vary greatly in size, even within the same category, but every room I saw had the same small shower.  I'm a big guy, and it was okay, but most definitely not roomy.

3.  If you're used to having an ice machine on every floor - there isn't one.  But you can easily call room service and they'll gladly bring you one.

I have to say as well that the service in the hotel was outstanding.  Every person I had contact with addressed me by name, was very professional and very friendly.

Recommended!",4,2008,05,15
202,"Nice hotel, Great location","This hotel was formed from a collection of several old buildings in the center of Dublin (including one bank - the vault is now the hotel bar).  The rooms are large, classically appointed and have large, marble bathrooms.  The service is only adequate and the room service is OK at best, but the location makes up for these minor problems.  You are literally within walking distance to the most popular Dublin sites and directly across from Temple Bar, which is an area of town with lots of restaurants and pubs.  You are also within a short walk to Grafton Street, where there are many nice shops and more restaurants.  This area leads you right to St. Stephen's Green Park, which is a great place to relax on the rare sunny days.",4,2008,05,05
202,Oasis of calm in a busy city,"We've stayed in the Westin on a couple of occasions now, and will do so again.  We last stayed for a long weekend before Christmas. It was great to do some shopping, come back to the hotel to dump our bags, and relax in the Atrium for an hour or so before heading back out to the shops.  It's centrally situated between Grafton Street and the Henry Street shopping area, and a five minute walk from loads of excellent restaurants.  The hotels own restaurant is also very good.
The rooms are not huge, but very well equipped, as you'd expect at the price, and well serviced.  Staff are helpful and polite, and plentiful - you rarely need to wait more than a few moments for service in the bars or at reception. All in all a relaxing place to stay.",4,2008,05,03
202,Great hotel - if you can afford it !,"Probably repeating much of whats whats been said before, in summary, without price considerations, would definitely reccommend. 
I found the staff very helpful (better English than some English people I know!)..I did need some help with one or two things so I dont just mean they were pleasant, (which they were) but genuinely helpful. 
Great location right in the centre of things.
I had an atrium room which, yes, didn't have natural daylight,  but colleagues who have stayed there before chose these as well, they said that rooms facing the street could be very noisy and atrium-facing was far preferable.
Very comfy bed.  Room was a little small but I have stayed in much smaller.  
Spacious tiled separate shower cubicle, better than the usual 'bath with shower curtain'.but there is a bath also.
Free internet access (apparently) but I didn't use it so cant comment on how well it worked.
Luckily, I wasn't paying for this myself. I would characterise this as a great business hotel, and a good tourist one (for facilities and location) if you can afford it or can get a deal. Breakfast was pricey as well, cooked breakfast was 27 Euros.",5,2008,05,02
202,Great Hotel,"Spent a weekend in April at the end of a business trip at the Westin Dublin. GREAT HOTEL! No question about it, this is a luxury hotel at a competitive price. I've stayed in the area before and checked out other hotels, none compare. Great bed, beautiful bath, even the closet space is superior. Can't wait to return!",5,2008,04,22
202,Westin - Amazing.,"From the minute we arrived at the Westin, our experience was first class and worth every penny.  Our room was ready for us within an hour of arrival (at 9AM!) and was fabulous.  While not the largest room on our trip to Ireland/NI, it was the most luxurious with a fantastic bath (tub and separate tiled shower).  On top of the excellent accomodations, the service was impeccible.  We were greeted each of our 3 days by name, were helped with hints and tricks for a great stay, and assisted without a second's wait with cabs, dinner reservations, etc.

The location was, well, perfect.  Across the street from Temple Bar, next door (literally) to Trinity College and the Book of Kells, a 5 minute walk to Grafton Street shops, and a 10 minute walk to Christ Church, the history museums, and another couple of minutes to St. Pat's Cathedral.  It was a 9 euro cab to Guiness and 10 euro cab to the Gaol.  We never used the bus or LUAS but they were everywhere -- convenient and inexpensive.

The bar at the Westin (The Mint Bar) in the basement was great too -- excellent drink list, poured a great pint, and was a welcome escape from the crown on St. Patrick's night.  They had a great band one night and traditional Irish music another.

It was a classy, luxurious stay and we'd love to return again some day.  Dublin is a great town, more European than Irish (like the west of the country) but had excellent food and plenty of sites to enjoy.  A couple of dining hints -- try Monty's of Kathmandu in Temple Bar...that's right, Nepalese food...outstanding!  For traditional Irish, we loved Gallagher's Boxty House, again, in Temple Bar.  There are plenty of touristy spots in that location but all in all, you can find what you want...all within a minute's walk of the hotel.

Try Dublin for St. Pat's Day once in your life -- it was very fun and an experience to remember...",5,2008,03,28
202,Fabulous Westin,"Immaculate, spacious rooms and courteous staff all right in the perfect location.  My husband and I stayed here on vacation and have nothing but positive things to say about this hotel.  From the moment we walked in the door, we were impressed.  I was worried that our room would be small & shabby as we had booked through a discount hotel web site and I couldn't have been more wrong.  The room was spotless and spacious, with an amazing bathroom and comfortable bed.  

What makes this hotel perfect is the location.  Walk out your front door and the city awaits.  There is a bus stop for the airport shuttle directly across the street and Temple Bar and Trinity College are just a few steps away.  There is also easy access to Taxis and the hop on-hop off bus tours.  

We ate at the Atrium restaurant one night and were pleasantly suprised at the quality and value of the meal.  Also, the staff was great.  We had been overcharged for our dinner in the restaurant and had no problem when we contested the charge on check-out.  

We would definitely stay here again and recommend it for anyone planning to travel to Dublin.",5,2008,03,25
202,Westin did not disappoint & we got our money's worth,"Stayed here for a week and had excellent experience, as well we should have, as this is an expensive hotel.  The room was large, esp by European standards.  The location is perfect, right next to Trinity College and basically within walking distance of everywhere one would go in Dublin.  The concierge staff are really friendly and helpful, obviously well-trained.  
A couple of quirks: no clock in the room that lights up all time, so no way to tell in the dark what time it is.  The TV clock only lights up when the TV is on.  The pillows could use a bit more stuffing.  Breakfast is very expensive, even for continental, but there is a Starbucks in easy walking distance.
Anyway, I have nothing even remotely resembling a horror story to tell re the Westin.  I would definitely recommend the Westin is Dublin for anyone who is willing spend some money on an upscale hotel.  We got what we paid for!",5,2008,02,10
202,Good Experience Overall,"My sister booked this trip to Ireland for us, and I cannot say enough how much I LOVED Ireland, and Dublin.

The Westin was a good experience.  The staff were friendly and knew us by name.  They helped us with all our questions.  The doorman was also great- gave us little tidbits of advice on our way out and was just a friendly, knowledgeable man.  He seemed to be one of the few Irish people working at the hotel.

We had tea in the mezzanine level.  The initial service was good, but we could not get anyone back to help us when we needed more cream.  The price was high, but not unreasonable compared to what we paid at the Dorchester in London.  

Our room was very nice, and the bathroom was truly superb.  HOWEVER, the fixtures had scum around the base of them.  That was both the sink and the shower faucet handles.  We had a room that overlooked the area where we had tea.  It made the room kind of dark with no proper outside window, but we turned on all the lights and it was fine.  

We did not use parking.  We did buy some postcards in the tiny gift shop and they mailed them for us as well.  

There were all kinds of amenities in the room, and the room was well stocked with toiletries and towels.

The lobby is tiny and not really designed for sitting and chatting, but the mezzanine was nice and no one even suggested we leave at any time, even when we were not eating/drinking.  

The second we walked in, and each time we re-entered the hotel there was someone there watching.  The first time they rushed up to help us.  Every other time, they greeted us, usually by name. This made me feel that the hotel is fairly secure, with the doorman also keeping an eye on things.

The location could not have been better.  A minute's walk to Trinity College, to Temple Bar, and 3 minutes to the river.  

This Westin was nicer than the one I stayed at in Charlotte.

I do not know about the value because I do not know what my sister paid for the room.  I am sure it was not inexpensive.

Whoever hires staff at this hotel does a good job at judging the genuine niceness of the people they hire.",5,2008,02,10
202,Westin- What a Waste!,"We stayed in the The Westin, Dublin for three nights a few weeks ago while attending a family wedding. It was expensive but we wanted to stay at the wedding venue for convenience and didn't mind paying the money as we were expecting a 4/5 star experience at a 4/5 star hotel. We decided not to bring the car as there is an additional charge for hotel guests of 20 Euro per day for the use of the hotel carpark.

We stayed in room 320 which was a narrow L shaped room and the only windows over looked the building's internal atrium. Which gave us a view of the hotel bar and no natural light. When I tried to unpack, I had to move an armchair repeatedly to facilitate the closet doors opening.

The hotel provides in every room, the use of an international socket adapter, It has a little card attached saying, ""The Westin Hotel"", if  and when you pick it up to read the reverse side, you're informed that a 10 euro fee has been automatically charged to your room unless you then bring the adapter down to reception. 

When I queried this with reception, I was told "" Not to worry, you don't need to bring it down, we trust our guests"". We found out later that family and friends had been charged unknowingly. Goodness knows how much revenue is generated by the "" Guest Convenience"" of the international socket adapter.

Also, just be aware, there is no hotel residence bar, and if you have a problem you might run into language fluency difficulties with the staff, who are otherwise helpful . 

Overall, it  was a very disappointing weekend.",2,2008,01,30
202,First-class stay in superb location,"I stayed one night during the busy holiday season at the Westin Dublin.  Excellent location, and the city centre was beautifully decorated for Christmas. 

Westin service and staff performance was spotless, very helpful and accommodating.   The public spaces in the hotel are small (not surprising for a historic building), but elegantly appointed.  There was a manager's reception in the Atrium Lounge in the evening, and I peeked in on it but didn't get to join; I don't usually bother with those evening receptions but I was sorry to miss that one, as the atmosphere seemed cozy and people were enjoying wine and snacks.

Due to SPG status, I received a Platinum upgrade to the Westmoreland Suite.   This is an enormous two-story suite with split-level sitting room and period furnishings and art.  There is a seating area, work space and credenza with mini-bar.  There is plenty of room for catering service. If you need to entertain guests or meet with clients, this would be an impressive setting to do so.  

The Westmoreland Suite is on the second floor so the windows are very high creating quiet and privacy -- but nor can you see the city scene below.  And, this suite is right behind the enormous clock mounted on the Westin's exterior wall, so there is a wee bit of noise from the clock machinery in that area of the sitting room.

The bedroom was of average size for a Westin -- so, not too big by American standards but nice size for a European property.  Flat-screen TV in the bedroom, nice linens, all what you'd expect for this brand and price point.  Robes and slippers in the closet were handy on the cold wooden and tile floors.

The bathroom was nicely appointed:  marble, full glass shower, separate full tub, two vanities, lots of light.  

I didn't avail of any of the hotel's dining services, other than a cocktail with some colleagues in the Mint Bar.  (It was a posh setting, but  since the place was packed due to xmas parties, we didn't stay long.)  I didn't use or see any of the spa or health facilities.  

I would definitely return; this would be just the place for a romantic evening or a luxury getaway in the city centre.",5,2008,01,20
202,"NIce rooms, good location.  Disappointing overall experience...","I booked 2 twin rooms for a Sunday night at the start of December.  The plan was that my sister, mother, aunt and I would go to Dublin for a Sunday of shopping in the city centre followed by a Monday of shopping in the Dundrum centre.  We decided that as I was just 8 months pregnant it would be wise to take the car up to Dublin so that we could drive to Dundrum and from there continue in the direction of home. It would also allow us to leave any purchases we made in the Dundrum centre in the car; I wouldn't have to carry them around for the day.  As I had previously stayed in this hotel on a number of occasions I was aware that they offer valet parking for a reasonable fee and I advised my Mum (the driver) of this fact.  

When we arrived at the hotel we organised to have our car parked, the valet stepped into our perfectly functioning car and we proceeded into the hotel.  We were greeted very well at the front desk and were assigned two very nice twin rooms side by side. Both had clean, bright bathrooms.  Previously, when I had stayed here with my husband, we had always had a double room.  In my opinion the twin rooms were probably nicer.  They were certainly more spacious - the double rooms are quite small.  We spent the afternoon exploring Grafton St. which is nearby. The hotel's location is extremely central.  We ate outside the hotel so I can't comment on the dinner and followed our meal with some drinks in the hotel's atrium lounge which was fine.  

My main problem with the hotel and its service arose the following morning when checking out at 10.30 am. we asked for our car to be returned so we could continue on to Dundrum.  There was some muttering behind the desk and we were told that there was a problem with our car.  It had a flat battery and would not start.  In a circumstance such as this, given that you are dealing with a five star hotel, you would expect the problem to have been rectified before 10.30 am., or if it was just discovered you would expect an explanation/apology along the lines of: 'we have just discovered that we left a light on/door open in your car and the battery has run flat, we're very sorry and we are doing everything to rectify the problem'.  While I appreciate that these things can happen to anyone there were a number of factors in the way the hotel dealt with this matter which have affected my opinion and thus my rating of this hotel.
Firstly, we were told that they were aware of a problem with our car since that morning - yet nobody contacted us until we looked for the car.  At this point my opinion of those working in the front line fell rapidly, no one seemed to be in a position/able to show any initiative.
Secondly, it was implied that our car was somehow  faulty as if the car we had handed in the previous day was not in perfect working order.  The impression we were given was our car was 'broken', now how were we going to 'fix' it.  Not very good approach to customer relations!
Thirdly, for a five star hotel offering 'valet parking' not to possess a set of jump leads beggars belief.  Even more incredible was the fact that they were unable in an entire morning to locate a set of jump leads and instead rang my Mum's insurance company to come and jump start the car. 
Fourthly, when my Mum wrote a very civil letter expressing her disappointment at the hotel's managament of the matter they did not have the manners (or possibly manager competence?) to reply.  For an establishment in the hospitality industry to fail to respond to a balanced letter of complaint shows scant regard for the customers they are hoping to attract.
While the matter of parking may not pertain to everyone staying in this hotel, the hotel's lack of customer service when a problem arose would make me wary of recommending this hotel to visitors.",2,2008,01,16
202,"Great location, limited food options","We stayed for a night around Xmas. The rooms must be really small as the standard room would not fit a cod for our baby and hence we needed to upgrade to a Deluxe room. 
The location is great, the entrance area is very impressive and our room (after the upgrade) was very nice and spacious.
The atrium is nice enough but not as good as shown on the internet pages. We tried to eat just after 9pm, which was almost impossible. The atrium area was totally deserted and stopped serving at 9, the restaurant takes last orders at 9 and the large bar was freezing as the doors were open for some open-for-public event and only had very limited bar food.
Parking is a bit of an issue, better pre-reserve some space with the hotel. Overall a good alternative to the other up-market hotels.",4,2008,01,03
202,Excellent location with great service.....,"A short trip prior to Xmas and we found Dublin really in the festive mood.  Reception could not have been slicker and the room was of the usual Westin standard.   Overlooked side street but with good view.  Unfortunately woken at  2am on first night by boisterous youths going home from a night out. This was despite full double glazing.
The interior of this old Victorian bank is most unusual and the Atrium is particularly beauiful.  The conversion is a triumph.
We reserved in the restaurant for our first evening with some trepidation as we often find hotel food whatever the status tends to disappoint. This could not have been further from the truth.  A truly superb meal, costly but worth every euro !  Impeccable friendly service with excellent local ingredients crafted into imaginative and attractive dishes combined to make a memorable occasion.  Not far off a Michelin award.
The Mint Bar downstairs in the original Bank vaults caters for residents and non-residents alike, young and old.  Trendy cocktails on offer but we never got past the great Guiness.  Good well presented food compliments the drinking.  Service highly proficient and very friendly....mostly eastern european staff who worked their socks off!
All in all a really good visit......the only negative was the taste of the tap water.....in the restaurant and in the room.....a nasty musty aroma and most unpleasant taste.  This is not a Dublin problem as the water at lunch in a pub very nearby  was perfect. I'm sure the hotel will address this as I mentioneded it on departure.",5,2007,12,24
202,"Superb location, what there is of it is excellent!","I'd stayed at Cassidys Hotel booked through Priceline.com on my previous visit to Dublin and after a shambolic experience with the reservation decided to do things directly through the hotel, on SPG.com.

The Westin has an unbeatable location right next to Trinity College, the Liffey and the Temple Bar area. Staff were great and kindly upgraded me to a Junior Suite, apparently on the back of my SPG Gold status, even on my cheap 250 euro/night rate! 

The room wasn't that big for a Junior Suite but it, like the rest of the hotel felt very nicely put together. 

As for the hotel they have a proper bar downstairs and unlike most chain hotels it is reasonably priced and used by locals. We spent an hour or so there before venturing out into Dublin.

Would certainly return here!",4,2007,12,04
202,Modern hotel in the greatest of historic locations,"The Westin Dublin gets added to the list of our favorite hotels in the world.  We had a simply splendid time on a quick weekend getaway.  I can't overestimate how great the location is.  It is right down the street from Temple Bar in one direction and Trinity College and Grafton Street in the other.  In three days there we didn‚Äôt need to catch a cab or a bus once.  The hotel itself is just what you would hope for, in that it is a historic old bank building that has been transformed into a state of the art hotel.  Our room was, I believe, a platinum upgrade.  Not what I would call huge, but nice sized.  Fantastic bathroom with premium amenities.  Concierge was very helpful, and the Mint Bar is one hopping place on a Saturday night with lots of locals, which was fun.  Great place, up to the best of Westin's standards.",5,2007,12,04
202,Pleased with Westin,"We arrived at noon and received a room right away.  The staff realized it was American Thanksgiving and helped us find a nice restaurant right away.  Our room was on the Atrium courtyard.  It bothered me a touch that there was very limited natural light, but the room lighting was adequate.  The room was large enough, the bath enormous.  There was a separate tub and shower.  The bath had the beginnings of mildew problems and I used one of their washcloths to clean around the tap.  Other than the mildew, which I think should never be in any hotel, let alone a 5 star, everything was correct.  The rest of the room was immaculate.  There was a flat panel TV mounted to the wall.  There were large toiletries, enough for both  of us each day.  More than enough towels.  There were bathrobes and slippers as well.  The mini bar was very sensitive and when my daughter slipped a drink in, it must have set off the mini bar and we were charged (on screen bill).  However, the next day they must have seen we did not consume anything and the charges were removed without having to say anything.  Concierge (there were several) were very helpful.  The desk and porter staff were cordial and helpful.  Peter the doorman was WONDERFUL.  I wanted to talk to him just to hear his friendly voice and Irish accent.  We asked for a late checkout and were told 2:00 would be fine. However when we tried to get back into the room after 1:00 to get our luggage, they had locked us out.  It made me feel like a criminal, although the desk clerk did his best to gloss over the problem and apologized sincerely.  The tea in the Atrium was very nice, although the service was not.  It was 24 euro, a good bit less than the other hotels.   I would stay at the Westin again, although the price on Priceline was more than the hotel's own website, so checkout Westin's site first!  I have to say I do not think you can get a better location in Dublin and the staff were genuinely polite and helpful.",4,2007,11,28
202,the best staff and hotel in dublin,"without doubt having stayed here again this has to be the best hotel in dublin. booked once again for my girlfriends birthday and upon checking in didnt have the champagne and strawberries on arrival;. upon checking with reception they said that this would be in the room at 4pm. just as i was giving up they arrived with a birthday cake for my girlfriend and a card for me welcoming me back from the hotel

that in all says everything about the staff, the most polite and courteous i have ever come across. this is the best hotel ever!",5,2007,11,08
202,Great luxury hotel,"We had 2 rooms at the Westin Dublin for 2 nights in early Oct 07. The hotel is beautiful and very centrally located - between Trinity College & the River, across from the entrance to Temple Bar area. They were very helpful during the booking process and worked diligently to get our rooms early since we arrived in the morning after an all night flight from the States. One of our rooms was ready around 10am. One of the rooms was the handicap accessible room, which was huge with an  oversized bathroom - perfect for my parents, one of which is in a wheelchair. Our room was also lovely with a beautiful marbled bathroom. The restaurant is also great - we had breakfast there upon arrival and they even accommodated some special requests that were not on the menu. The staff were approachable, gracious and helpful - especially the front desk & concierge. The only downside is you have to pay 20 euros per night for parking. Highly recommend the Westin Dublin.",5,2007,10,30
202,"Nice hotel, great location",We spent three nights in October at the Westin.  Got a good rate on line and later accepted their offer to upgrade to a junior suite.  The room was very nice with every ammenity we would want.  I am getting into this trowser press thing.  The staff was excellent.  Everyone was very friendly and efficient.  The concierge was very knowledgeable and helpful from finding Irish music and dance to recommending a great restaurant (The Eden on Temple Bar).  We were there three days and by the third day the staff was greeting us like old friends.  The Vault bar is a lively place to stop and have a drink in the evening.,5,2007,10,29
202,"Nice hotel, good option in Dublin","Stayed 2 nights at the Westin in Dublin on a family vacation.  Details...

GOOD:
--Elegant, wonderful building
--Common spaces, while not large, were pleasant
--Staff was friendly and very helpful
--Rooms are comfortable and well-furnished

BAD:
--Rooms are very small
--As with all the good hotels in central Dublin, its pricey

I don't know Dublin too well, but, I do recommend this property.",4,2007,10,26
202,"Great location, nice hotel","The Westin is in one of the best locations in the city, halfway between the main shopping streets in the north and south sides of the river Liffey. I have stayed here several times and could not fault it. The service is always friendly and professional. The rooms have always been clean and well laid out. Breakfast is good but a bit on the expensive side.
Its not a 'wow' hotel, but it is a good option if you are staying in the city and I have got several good rates from booking over the web.",4,2007,10,22
202,Heavenly Bed - hardly!,"The Westin's web site boasts of their  ""Heavenly Bed"" in each room.

It's more like the Hellish Bed. While the mattress is the pilllow top style, they are so weak that you roll towards the center.  I had to hug the edge of the bed to get any support.

This wasn't a fluke.  We were in two different rooms (two floors apart) during our stay and both beds were a nightmare.

Plus, many staff members don't speak English very well,  and their understanding of Western culture is limited.

To be fair, the location is great , breakfast is better than average and the staff is friendly and attentive.

202,Solid 5 Stars,"Great location in Dublin with great access to Temple Bar and to Grafton Street. We were lucky enought to stay in a Junior Suite which had a great view of Trinity College and superb facilities (see pic).
 
Staff were also extremely helpful at all times and concierge was able to provide a lot of helkp in organising restaurants and travel. Only issue we had was a problem when we ordered breakfast in our room which ended up being the wrong order and took over an hour! Having said that, the duty manager called to apologise and we enjoyued as complimentary bottle of red wine that night!
 
Only reservation is that it feels more oriented to the business traveller than to the family but we nevertheless had a great stay.

202,"Amazing hotel, excellent location!","The Westin Dublin is located in the heart of Dublin, right next to Trinity College.  We were able to walk everywhere; the location just can't be beat.  There are convenience stores, restaurants, shops, Trinity College, etc. surrounding this beautiful property.  Westin Dublin is an old bank, and we stayed in the highest floor in a deluxe room that was a good size.  The room was always kept clean.  We had a balcony overlooking the city.  The staff could not do enough for us.  Whenever we requested for something, housekeeping was at our door within 5 minutes.  We did not get a chance to eat at the hotel restaurant, so I cannot comment on the quality (there were too many restaurants in the area to sample).

202,Classy hotel close to all the action,"Luxurious hotel, which you expect for 5 stars.  Wonderful lobby, atrium and a fantastic bar underground in an old converted bank vault.

Right in the heart of Dublin next to Trinity College and opposite Temple Bar.

If your budget stretches this far you won't be disappointed, however breakfast was an expensive extra.
",4,2007,08,21
202,Great Location,"Stayed at the Westin during the weekend. We were swiftly given our rooms on the 4th floor. The hotel facade was a little dark so the hotel was somewhat difficult to find. I am assuming there was something wrong with the lighting. Anyhow, the reception area is beautiful and well appointed. Our rooms were very comfortable but perhaps on the smaller side. The bathroom was large marble with both a shower and a tub, this was very nice. The room itself was your standard westin/starwood. The bed was a little sunk in and the room started to show some signs of wear and tear. Nothing really major but enough to notice if you paid attention. The staff was great and very service oriented. They arranged everything we requested and gave off a very positve attitude. Our only complaint during out stay was the breakfast. It was in the restaurant and was standard buffet style. The biggest problems were that the trays were always empty and you had to ask them to refill them. I guess this is to keep the food fresh at all times but eating became somewhat annoying. The selection was not impressive and the hot food items were not very tasty. There were no selection of cheese, eg Gouda, Emmentaler Cheddar etc and almost no cold meats such as ham, salami, etc. We did special order a few omelettes during our breakfast and these were fine, but it took forever to cook them. I summary, the westin is a very nice hotel in the best location. Only thinng that was a big minus was the breakfast. However, if you drop the breakfast its great

202,Wonderful Stay!,"We stayed here two nights in June 2007 as part of a Tauck tour.

The stay was excellent in every regard.

Checkin was amazingly efficient.

The room was wonderful - it wasn't exceptionally large, but had plenty of room, with a nice, oversized bathroom.  The bed was big and extremely comfortable.

Our room overlooked Trinity College - we didn't notice any traffic noise from outside at all.

We ate breakfast and supper in the restaurant, and all meals were excellent - the service was top notch.

The location of the hotel couldn't be better - two blocks from Temple Bar - Trinity College right across the street - two blocks from the Ha'penny bridge - about 5 blocks from St. Stephen's Green.

Checkout was quick and efficient.

The hotel does not have a pool, which was not an issue for us, but might be for others.

My wife is a runner, and they even provided a small plastic card with running routes with defined distances.

All in all, I couldn't imagine a better stay - everything was top notch.

202,Great Hotel,"We booked this hotel on Last Minute.com as a secret hotel. We didn't know which hotel we were going to stay in until we had paid. We went for my 21st birthday and it was fantastic.

The hotel is in a perfect location, really close to everything but still quiet. The room was immaculate with views into the hotels atrium lounge. The bathroom was very spacious with a walk in double shower and bath.

We didn't eat in the hotel but it was great as a nice place to relax with a drink. The Mint bar is a great place for cocktails and guiness and the atrium lounge is a great place to sit. All the staff were really friendly and helpful except for the male receptionist who was quite rude.

We would definitely go back to this hotel.

The location is so close to almost everything fun to do and see in Dublin. You can walk to dozens of fascinating places, shops and restaurants.  It is across the street to the Trinity College and the walking mall.  Surrounding restaurants were incredible.  The beds were delightful.  One of our rooms was massive.  The concierges were so supportive to make recommendations for restaurants and entertainment.

202,A fine hotel with an excellent location - just don't expect anything different..,"I stayed at the Westin on business.  The conference I was attending was also held at the hotel.

The Westin is a perfectly pleasant 5 star hotel.  As others have noted below it does the things you expect such an establishment to do well, well.  Check in and out was fast and efficient, the staff were friendly, the food and drink was decent (the Mint bar in the basement was particularly lively) and the conference facilities were first rate (the banking hall is an especially spectacular room).

My room was on the top (6th I think) floor and faced the hotel‚Äôs atrium.  As such there was no view which was a little disappointing.  On the plus side this did mean that it was quiet.  Some colleagues with rooms facing the street did note some traffic noise but nothing too horrendous.  My only other criticism would be that the bathroom was a little tired.

The hotel actually suffered a boiler breakdown on my second morning there resulting in no hot water.  This was generally well handled with a letter of a apology in our rooms accompanied with a miniature bottle of whiskey.  

The location of the hotel can‚Äôt be faulted either.  It is located right next to Trinity College and opposite Temple Bar and a 5 minute walk away from Grafton Street.

All in all a fine place to stop ‚Äì just don‚Äôt expect it to be different from any other European five star hotel.

202,Fabulous!  We'd stay here again,"Alrighty, the best parts are that the Heavenly Bed, Heavenly Bath and Heavenly Shower are absolutely TRUE!  The room was on the small side, but I'm an American, and on our standards it was small, but for Europe, it was completely decent.  I've stayed in many Westin hotels, W's, and Four Points which are all part of the same conglomerate.  The thing with the Westin is you can count on them being CLEAN, with a big bathroom and iffy service.   The service in the Westin Dublin was fabulous!  But I did have to complain by email in order to get their advertised rates.  That kinda sucks, and I think they gave me an extra yucky view just because they could.  I loved that the hotel was so central and an easy walk to get milk, water, and great shopping.  We're planning on taking my husband's parents on a holiday and since they won't fly to America or anywhere else, we'll take them to Dublin (they live in Cork).  It will be great because they are older and being so central we can go for a short walk and still see quite a lot.  After 14 hours by plane and hanging around airports for connecting flights it was absolutely WONDERFUL to arrive into such a pleasant clean room.  We're delighted that we chose to go with the Westin Dublin.

202,"Elegant, centrally located hotel","We loved the Westin Dublin!  The hotel is perfectly located in Dublin.  It is extremely convenient to sights, restaurants, shopping and bus service.  The interior of the Westin is lovely.  The lobby is elegant and we really enjoyed the light-filled and spacious Atrium one level above the lobby.  It‚Äôs a great place to have a drink and read the newspapers which are provided.  We also liked our room, which looked just like other Westins we have stayed in and was quite comfortable.  The huge bathroom with separate tub and shower is a big plus.  Our first floor room had a nice view of Trinity College and the busy city streets, but our room was completely quiet thanks to double window panes.

We didn‚Äôt try any of the hotel restaurants (there are so many other great choices nearby), but we did have the concierge help us check on tickets to a sporting event and he was very helpful and informative.  We also valet parked our car at the hotel with no problems.  We notified the hotel in advance that we‚Äôd be bringing a car and they parked it for us at a charge of 20 euro.  From the valet to the bellhop to the staff at the front desk, everyone we encountered at the Westin was warm and welcoming.  We couldn‚Äôt have asked for better customer service.  The price tag at the Westin is steep, but this hotel is a class act through and through.  We would absolutely choose to stay here again if returning to Dublin and definitely recommend it to others.

The location is great, too - right at the Trinity College end of Grafton Street. We booked on Priceline and got the room for $200 a night. All in all, an extremely comfortable and enjoyable stay.

202,What a location,"My daughter and I have just had a weekend at the Westin, staying in a twin deluxe room, and it was excellent. The plus points of the room were the beds (amongst the most comfortable we have had), bathroom very spacious (with separate bath and shower), plenty cupboard space. However the view from the window was very disappointing (it looked out onto a very small internal courtyard) and there was only a coffee machine, no kettle. We could use it to boil water but our cup of tea tasted of coffee!
The hotel couldn't be in a better location, just at the foot of Grafton Street. We had breakfast in the Equinox restaurant and chose Continental as the choice was very varied - plenty fruit juices, large selection of fresh fruits, cereals, pancakes, waffles, cheeses, smoked salmon, breads, muffins and pastries. We had drinks in the Atrium which was delightful and all staff were very friendly.
We took the airport coach and it stops 100yards from the front door of the hotel. We didn't eat in the hotel in the evening but can recommend both FXB Steakhouse and Acapulco Restaurant. both within 5 minutes walk from the hotel. 
Would definately return to this hotel.

202,Gret location. Great hotel.,"In terms of city centre location, and in terms of 5 star, (in my opinion), there is either the Westbuy or Westin for Dublin City. Although the Westbury probably (slightly - they are basically at opposite end of Grafton Street area) pips the Westin in terms of location, the Westin scores better in terms of rooms, staff , dining, lounging areas and fitness centre. 
Earlier poster described the Westin as a generic 5 * hotel, which personally, I feel is unfair. Atrium lounge is unique, as is the bar in the cellar. Bedrooms are fresh and quite large, and ensuites are anything but standard.
However, it is the staff that has really won us over from other hotels in Dublin City. The staff  treat children with the same friendliness / professionalism as they treat the business traveller, which, for me, is indicative of the purest style of hotel management. Well done Mr. Mullins! Hope you continue to manage in your unique style.
",5,2007,03,16
202,"Comfortable, boring, generic 5-star hotel","The Westin Dublin is impressively straightforward. What do you want from a 5-star hotel? Good view? check. Clean, elegant rooms? Check. Attentive, friendly staff? Check. Good dining? Check. Impressive bathrooms with complete toiletry set? Check. In-room entertainment system with multiple films? Check. Terrific location? Check.

I was in Dublin visiting friends, and chose the Westin for the location and the three-for-two day deal on offer. And indeed it's a beautiful building, close to Temple Bar (for drinking), Trinity College (for culture and magnificent architecture, especially the Long Room above the book of Kells) and St Stephen's Green (for just wandering through).

On my first night I ventured downstairs to the hotel bar and found myself in a Salsa night. This kinda cheered me up and I went to bed with a huge grin on my face.

On the second night my friend and I drank the entire top shelf of irish whiskey, with recommendations (and freebies) from the manager.

On the third night a new friend came to stay, so I had an early night.

Overall experience? It's opulent and comfortable. It's not particularly stylish; it doesn't have anything unique about it. Something tells me that the facilities are designed by a marketing department that's ticking off the boxes. Given the nature of my trip I was just fine with that approach. However, if I were staying in Dublin again I might seek out a more boutique place to stay.

202,Classy...,"Based in the centre of this historic and upcoming city, The Westin is ‚Äúthe‚Äù hotel in Dublin. It‚Äôs also a hotspot for the locals who want that serious business meeting or special supper. What was once an 1800 century monastery is now a fully loaded 5 star hotel oozing with class.

Being in a city centre location the views are not that of exotic beaches or golf courses but more of busy traffic and some rather old Irish buildings. The rooms are richly furnished and the beds have the Westin trademark of extreme comfort. Formality ‚Äì I find ‚Äì plays a huge role in upper class western European hotels so although Westin hotels are usually very modern and boxy/flat screen/chic orientated; this one was ‚Äúa formal Westin‚Äù. 

I found navigation in the hotel quite complex; the layout is a kind of maze thus when looking for my bedroom I found myself ‚Äì suitcases in hand ‚Äì in the middle of a wedding reception. Comfortable room with all the extras including the trouser press, robe/slippers and umbrella, big bathrooms all stacked up with Molton Brown goodies and a separate walk-in shower. 

I prescribe minor decoration updates to some carpets and wallpaper but definitely a nice, classy hotel.

202,A Perfect Romantic Getaway,"We visited Dublin for a weekend for my wife's birthday and the hotel was chosen for two reasons: location and quality.

The location is excellent it has to be said.  You are situated to the north end of Grafton Street for the shopping, a 2 minute walk at most from Temple Bar; and to the North and across the river Liffey is O'Connell street for even more shops!!  Furthermore, you are a couple minute walk at the most from the nearest stop for the open top bus tour of Dublin.

The quality was there to be seen.  The separate bath and shower to the bathroom help a relaxing experience.  The rooms are a good size, each with their own individual character as the building used to be a bank.  A nice touch was bringing water round of an evening with the weather forecast for the following day.

The Atrium bar was very relaxing and a nice place to enjoy a pint or two.  The mint bar has an excellent atmosphere, good food and live entertainment including salsa and live bands.

We found Dublin to generally be expensive for food and drink, although the staff were always friendly, not only in the Westin, but everywhere we visited.

Overall the hotel has a fantastic location, is good value for money, and not a hen/stag party in sight!!

202,Great,"We have just returned from a two day break/Honeymoon in Dublin so I thought I had better make it a good hotel.  WE had a fantastic time in Dublin city centre made good by the experience of our hotel 'WESTIN' .  The hotel was perfectly situated at the foot of Grafton Street for shopping and was close enough for walking distance to The Temple Bar for good Irish pubs and a wealth of restaurants.  Make sure you go to The Porterhouse Inn up the road from Westin for top Irish beers with a difference.  The attention to detail in the Westin was what you would expect from a 5 star hotel, the breakfast was indeed 5 star.  The room was great despite being upgraded to a junior suite which we didn't want to leave!!
Overall nothing was too much bother for staff who were only too willing to help guests.

202,Great location and beautiful bathroom!,"This is an excellent hotel.  My only reservation is about the price.  It's high end and you pay for it, esp. with the weak exchange rate.   In this case, I used Starwood points to stay here since I normally wouldn't have spent the money.

When we arrived, check in was easy but there was some inital confusion about our room -- I upgraded to a King and we were not assigned to that type of room.  They CALLED it a King Bed Room, but it wasn't a King bed.  I actually had to take someone around to a Queen Bed Room and show them that they were the same size.  They compensated, however, by upgrading us to a two floor suite (with a King bed).  Needless to say, I was pleased with how they resolved the situation and we were flexible enough to wait for the cleaned suite.  The bathroom was HUGE and the toiletries very classy.  We had two televisions as well.

The hotel is in a perfect location, right in the center of the city and essentially across the street from Trinity College.  The staff were very polite and I would stay here again.  It's just a bit pricey given the US$ exchange rate.

202,Serious Housekeeping issues!  Not 5 star standard,"Period of stay 31st Dec-02nd January 2007

As a frequent visitor to Dublin and somebody who has stayed in about 5 different Dublin City Centre Hotels, we decided to treat ourselves for New Year and stay in this so called 5 star Hotel.
First impressions were very good, we had been allocated a room on the 3rd floor overlooking West Moreland Street so I was very happy and the hotel itself looked very nice, staff seemed very friendly.
On choosing which bed I would take I happened to glance under mine and noticed a yellow carrier bag, I didn't think too much about this and just left it where it was.
Anyway, that evening staff were knocking on every door giving out a small bottle of Rose wine and some chocolates which I thought was a nice touch, and my sister even commented how she would probably stay at this hotel again.
On New Years Eve we had popped into a couple of shops for some toiletry items namely expensive Shampoo's & Conditioner and some sweets & bars of chocolate which were in a large white Boots paper carrier bag, this was left next to our suitcase.
It was only on Tuesday morning, the day of checkout that my sister noticed that the bag had vanished. We know it was still there on New Years Day before the room had been cleaned because I had removed one of the Shampoo bottles to take in the shower.
We searched every nook & cranny of our room and it was nowhere to be seen.  Worse of all was when I told my sister to check under her bed, she called me over as she said "" there is an empy can of beer under here with god knows what stuffed inside it"".  When I looked I was disgusted, I don't know if it was tobacco or what the substance was but it became clear to me that Housekeeping  do not do their job properly, particularly with me also finding an empty bag under my bed on arrival.
On Checkout we informed the man on reception how unhappy we were that :-
1) Housekeeping had taken our bag which had items inside, thankfully they were only toiletries & Confectionary, but the bag was not placed near the bin in our room and they had no right to take it. A quick look inside would be clear to see that it was not rubbish. This has never happened to me in any other hotel and I've stayed in many around the world.
2) Housekeeping do not clean underneath the beds, and I may add when we went to have a coffee on the Tuesday morning our supply of milk & sugar had not been replenished so we had to have black coffee.
3) Also we changed some money at reception on Monday evening before we went out, the lady on reception was very pleasant and asked if we would be needing a wake-up-call on Tuesday morning, with us checking out I said yes at 10.30am please.
Tuesday morning and no wake up call at all, luckily I woke myself up but imagine if I were on Business and was relying on that call or if I hadn't woken up on time and missed my flight, it's simply not good enough for a 5 star hotel.

As I stated to the man on reception this is simply not good enough for a hotel which is supposed to be 5 star, I would expect to find old beer cans with rotting substances in them if I were  staying in a Hostel not a 5 star Hotel.

The man on reception apologised and knocked 40 euro off our in room dining bill, he said he would try to find out from Housekeeping what happened to our bag, but I said they had probably chucked it in the rubbish. I told him we were going out for something to eat and would be back in about 1 hour, he said he would go up to the room himself to see the beer can and get back to us.
When we arrived back at the hotel he wasn't on the reception and we had to get a taxi immediately to the airport as we were running late, so we never enquired as to the outcome, but it has definitely put us off ever staying at this Hotel again, which is a shame as for the first night I thought I would be giving it a great review.   

Please see my photo which I took of the revolting beer can, as a non-smoker I would just like to say to the previous occupant of room 314 use the rubbish bin that's what it's there for!

This Hotel should have had an excellent review but advice to the Westin, Housekeeping is dreadful and serious training needs to be undertaken!

202,Much Better Than the Reviews Made it Sound,"My fiance and I stayed in Dublin at the Westin for two nights during our week long vacation in Ireland. It's not like the Luxury Collection Westins in Italy but it's still a great, clean, luxury hotel.  The concierge made us last minute reservations at a restaurant I was unable to reserve before we left the US and they went out of their way when we decided to leave the day of the Dublin Marathon (anyone who's been there knows the city shuts down).  The bell hop walk us all the way across the Liffey with our luggage and stayed with us the 10 minutes it took to flag down a cab.  

The beds aren't the most comfortable of all the Westins I've stayed in, but that wasn't a big deal.  I'd definitely recommend.
",4,2007,01,04
202,Great Stay,"Normally, my friends & I don't stay at a place this expensive when we travel to Europe (preferring to spend our money elsewhere & we're hardly ever in the room), but one of our friends had a discounted rate for one of the nights we stayed, so we figured why not, let's splurge.  

Everything was great.  Great location.  The pictures of the lobby, bathroom & bar that are posted on this site are exactly what they look like in person (those are the only places we went in the hotel.)  The check in staff and bar staff/service was good.  Everyone friendly.  We arrived early in the morning & were able to check into our rooms right away.  That was unexpected.  The bar was packed late Saturday night.  They must have good sound proofing because we were surprised you couldn't hear it on the upper floors (there was a band).

The only bad thing was...we had requested roll aways (we had 3 people in a room) & it showed up for 1 of the rooms, but not the other.  That ended up being fine because it turned out we didn't need them.  The beds were bigger than expected.  So we canceled both.  They ended up not taking the roll away out of the 1 room & charged us for it on both rooms, but once it was explained that they were canceled, etc...the charges were taken off, no problems.

Overall, great stay.

202,Really memorable-for good reasons!!,"I stayed here with my partner on a 3 night break, and despite staying in many 5 * hotels, we both agreed this is our favourite so far. We were greeted wonderfully; friendly and professional without being pretencious. We were given an upgrade to a deluxe room that was really super, and were given the expected help with luggage etc. Rooms are unfussy but elegantly decorated; it feels like a quality room. Ours was at the front of the hotel from which we had a grand view of bustling Dublin. The TV is a very good size. The Mint Bar (it was never crowded when we stayed there) is amazing; a unique experience. The barman was a fantastic laugh and gave us some complimentary 'baby guinesses'. The Atrium is a perfect Oasis in the heart of the city and serve lovely afternoon tea. Concierge were ever so helpful with directions etc. The gym, although small, has everything you need, inc a bowl of apples! Nice touch we thought. Everything about the stay was enjoyable, thanks to the luxurious surroundings and the warm, friendly staff.
",5,2006,12,13
202,Classy business stay,"Stayed here one night on a lightning-fast visit to Dublin, so didn't get to experience many of the hotel's amenities, but the check-in was professional and friendly, the lobby attractive, and the room good-sized, quiet and clean. The bed was particularly comfortable.  I found the bathroom to be a little odd in the choice of materials, and the room overall had some odd uses of open space. The breakfast was pricey but good, in a classy setting.
",4,2006,11,28
202,A bit better than average business hotel,"Second time I have been here. The hotel is comfortable, the food and service is satisfactory. The main bar is however over run with pub goers.

202,Westin Dublin: a favorite property.,"Our visit to Dublin was right before the Christmas Holiday 2005. After a lost day due to bad weather in the USA arriving at the Westin was a relief. Our room was ""quirky"" but spacious and luxurious. The staff was pleasant and professional. It remains a favorite property for me, and I have stayed at rougly half the Starwood Luxury Collection properties in Europe.

Arriving quite early from the airport, 9am or so, and expecting to wait, the reception clerk was warm and courteous. She put us up right away, offering to guide us to the room, she was very professional and kind. Before I forget, the small lobby is a welcome sight for any traveler, especially on a cold December morning. Fires (a bit too hot at times) roaring in the fireplaces, and comfy seating.  This aspect of the hotel they did right.

Our room, I believe it may have been designed for handicapped guests, was oddly shaped and had one small window looking at the narrow but very busy street next to the hotel. Not much of a view, but the constant bus traffic below, I mean constant, was a non-issue noise wise. The room was spacious but really much of it was wasted space, a large entry way...just a bunch of carpeted floor, no real purpose. Still, I liked the decor, the bed was comfy, it was all kept up very well. The room was fine, but the trek to the elevators did take a while. There are only the pair if I recall and they are fairly distant from that far corner of the building.

We ate many meals at the hotel between restaurants and room service and enjoyed it immensly. The restaurant (Exchange?) was really quite good. The young waiter we had was just right. Friendly enough, but still professional and courteous. We did enjoy the welcome ""taste of Guinness"" offer at the small bar. The Vault was enjoyed for a pair of lunches. It is quite popular and can get loud, especially with some moron's musical cel phone always ""ringing"".  Good food in the vault, nice room, worth trying. We tried to get some service in the atrium, but that was a failure. This aspect fo the Westin was the only real downer for us. I think there was one server working, and she ignored us past my allotted wait and wait some more time. Nice area of the hotel though, again very popular.

Overall, the Westin is a delight. The reception staff and concierge were helpful. The front doorman is a classic. That guy is worth the visit alone. The location can be a bit noisy, with all the traffic (bus!) and Temple Bar right...there. Still, it is centrally located and a great property. I'd go back again, in a second. Westin Dublin, while not perect, is a strong deluxe level hotel.
",5,2006,11,07
202,Excellent in every way,"My fiance and I stayed three nights at the Westin in Dublin, following a cruise.  The hotel is beautiful and elegant.  the staff was professional, friendly and helpful, and the room service was very prompt.  we had a comfortable, nicely decorated and well equipped room on the 5th floor with a beautiful view overlooking trinity college.  the location of the hotel is excellent, and we were able to walk to many of the most popular sites in the central and old city areas, such as temple bar, castle, christchurch, pubs, etc.  the hotel is right near major bus lines for city tours.  there was a wonderful  and peaceful atrium lobby on the second floor, for light refreshments, drinks and newspapers.   it was a pleasant place to read and relax.  the bar, in a former bank vault below ground, was large and lively.  we had a farewell dinner at the restaurant, which was absolutely top notch.  we have stayed in many five star hotels, and this was right up there with the best.
",5,2006,10,16
202,It could only happen in Dublin !,"My recent stay at the Westin was disastrous. I am a Gold level Starwood Preferred Guest and this was not acknowledged at any point throughout my stay. I have stayed at the hotel on several occasions, the last occassion was also a poor experience, however I just put this down to a one off. On my most recent stay when I was cheking in I was told that I had not booked the deluxe room I had confirmed on the phone, I was told I could get a smoking traditional room. Eventually I succeeded in getting a a non smoking traditional room. On entering the room it was grubby , small and the paint was peeling in the bathroom. I requested another room and this was accepted. I had requested  3 sunday newspapers but were told these were unavailable. I walked across the road and bought them myself. When returning to my room later that evening my room had not being turned down I notified housekeeping and they sent up some fruit and water. The next morning I ordered room service, but ther was no knife on the tray to butter the soggy toast. On checking out I was treated with contempt and not even asked if I enjoyed my stay. I will not stay here again.
",1,2006,10,10
202,Stay somewhere else,"Very disappointed with the standard of service and facilities we received at the Westin. On arrival we were told rudely that we should have reserved car parking, then had to wait in the lobby for too long while the reservation staff eventually decided to stop chatting and eventually check us in . Our room was small - only space for one bedside table and no room to leave our case out on the luggage rack. There was a layer of dirt round the base of the taps in the bathroomand the bathrobes were frayed and tattered.
At breakfast the tea and coffee were cold as was most of the food on the 'hot' buffet and even after asking it took ten minutes to get empty plates of melon and pineapple replenished!
We will certainly not stay in the Westin Dublin again, as other 5* hotels offer better value and standards.
",1,2006,10,08
202,"5 star hotel, but lets itself down","The hotel itself is a very grand building and undergoing some repairs on the outside at the moment, but they don't cause any problems inside.  The reception is very grand, but it's not what I would call a spacious reception area with little seating in that area.  The rooms are well decorated, but are in need of some maintenance.  

The shower did have some mold between the tiles and the soap tray was loose.  I originally believed the coffee maker in the room was broken, when I spoke to reception they apologised and offered to send some tea to my room, however the issue was that the coffee maker was under the television and I assumed it was already plugged in, but you have to take it out and plug it into the wall, but the staff did not tell me that.  I would have expected the staff to have told me that I needed to take the machine out of the cupboard and plug it in elsewhere in the room.

The staff were generally very young and as such did not have the general experience in customer care and knowledge of the hotel or area.  The concierge did not seem to know what were the best things to do in town and did not really do anything to make our weekend better.  Although they did try their best.

The Mint bar was a very pleasent area and definitely somewhere worth just popping in.

The prices of drinks and food in the hotel (excluding the minibar) were very good and in fact I would say they are less than a lot of other bars / restaurants in the area.

All in all, it is a very dissappointing hotel for a 5 star rating.  I would stay again, but only if I could not find another hotel in the area at a competitive price.
",3,2006,09,04
202,Jacuzzi broken,"Booked a night in the Westin, Dublin. It was our 10th Anniversary so I emailed the hotel to ask them to to give us their best available room. Unfortunately no one knew anything about any email when I was checking in. I repeated my request but nothing was available but the Presidential suite. Since it was a special occasion and we were promised a jacuzzi bath I paid for the upgrade. When we were shown to the suite the bell boy didn't know where anything was. 
We were pleased to see a complementary bottle of champagne in our suite later that evening but disapointed when the jacuzzi didn't work. We reported it to maintanance. We were informed that it was ""probably the fuse again"". The fuse was duly reset and immediately blew again. I complained to reception on check out and received an apology. I feel I could have left it at that had I not been left with the impression that the hotel had already known of the problem. We had brunch next day which was very nice.
",2,2006,08,28
202,Not the same standard as other Westin's,"I've recently being doing business in Dublin and have stayed several times at the Crowne Plaza at the Airport.  This has been very pleasant.  However, this time I had some more time and thought I would stay downtown.

I ruled out the Hilton after reading some of the reviews here and opted for the Westin.  I'm a big fan of Starwood, however, I have to say I was a tad disappointed.

Check in
=======

Relatively quick, although I was a bit surprised to be asked for my passport, which as a European Citizen is unusual.  When I asked why, it turned out there was no need to complete it.  So why ask?

The room
========

I was, apparently, upgraded to a Superior Room on the Preferred Guest floor.  It was on the fourth floor overlooing the main road.  There was some road noise, but nothing terrible, even in the Monday morning rush hour.

The room looked as though it needed a paint and a general sprucing up.  Lots of bits of the paint on the woodwork was chipped and the main paintwork looked as if it had just been slapped on without any thought.

Other than that, it was clean and a decent size.

The bed
======

I was so looking forward to the Heavenly Bed.  Not sure that was what they had in the Westin in Dublin or if I was just unluckly with the bed I had.  It was ok, but not what I have come to expect from Westin.

The refurbished rooms in the InterCon on Bloor in Toronto was far superior to this one.

The bathroom
===========

The bathroom was huge with a separate shower, which I always think is a nice touch.  However, the way the shower was designed meant there was no easy way of getting the temparate correct before stepping into the shower.  So, you had to risk an icy blast or stand in an odd way to let it get hot but without getting wet.

The top of the shower looked as if it needed a good clean as it had that ""shower mould"" on the ceiling.  Not what you expect from a 5 star hotel.

Check out
========

Check out was uneventful (no extra charges on my bill from the Mint bar!) although no ""did I enjoy my stay"" or general enquiry if I would stay again.  

Which, when I am next back in Dublin, I will try elsewhere.
",3,2006,08,27
202,Beware the raffle bowl by the Mint Bar,"Definitely what you can expect from an expensive hotel that's steps away from Temple Bar.  The bathroom opens with double doors and the sink has elegant fawcets.  The internet line charge is very expensive (came to US$25 per day). 

What surprised me on checkout was that a huge bar tab from the Mint Bar was added to my bill.  Of course I asked the front desk clerk to show me the receipt that I signed that authorized this charge.  When I thought about it, the only way it could have happened is that the night before I dropped my business card into the typical glass raffle bowls that offer free such-and-such. Someone visiting the Mint Bar must have just taken my card and told the staff to charge their tab to my room. What daft people must this staff be to allow people to do that without asking for a signature and/or checking that the signature matches my signature on check-in. In any event, I didn't get charged for the bar tab.   I would look around for other hotels in the area, because this kind of sloppiness is not what I would expect from a Westin.
",3,2006,08,23
202,"Great location, worth the money?","First off I live in Dublin and stayed in the Westin for a company meeting. The actual hotel building is very nice and couldn't be in a better location. Meeting rooms for business are fine. Lunch in the hotel bar was good but service wasn't exactly friendly. We also had some pre-dinner drinks in the atrium area which is very nice but again service wasn't brilliant. Very good bedroom and food and service in the Exchange is very good but you do pay for the privilege. Not sure if I''d be prepared to pay for the stay personally as it's expensive but if your company expense a/c would stretch that far or if you're looking to treat yourself while in Dublin I'd recommend the Westin.
",4,2006,08,23
202,Loved the Westin,"We stayed at the Westin, Dublin over Easter week in April. The hotel was very nice. The airline lost our luggage and the concierege took care of everything for us- which was a nice touch. I emiled the hotel prior to our arrival and mentionedd that it was our anniversary trip. We were upgraded to an executive corner room with a very nice balcony. The hotel room was one of the nicest that I have stayed in and I travel quite frequently in the United States.  The room was very spacious and I think an executive room was probably worth the extra money. If you are interested in being in the middle of the action this is the perfect place to stay. It is right across the street from Temple Bar and I wouldn't have stayed any closer. The hotel was close enough to be accessible to everything but not noisy and crowded. We took the air coach to and from the airport and the stop is right across from the hotel so that was very convienent and cost effective- I wouldn't have used any other transportation.
The rooms were all redone as was most of the hotel. The staff was very nice and accomodating and we were very happy with our stay. I am a very picky traveler and I don't think that there was anything that I was not happy with at this hotel.
",4,2006,07,18
202,Full of celebs,"Very unimpressed from the moment I was met at the lobby. Reception seemed to be full of celebrities and all of them were wearing what seemed like staff uniforms... mega into each other and their social lives and none interested in joe bloggs.Very poor guest relations by many of the front of house staff. Check in and getting the luggage to the room was such a struggle I guess it would be easier to land a man on the moon.This is the hospilatity business after all not the airline transportation business.Its got to be hard to lose 2 suitcases over 3 floors or is it? I would not be impressed if an airline did it but Westin can. I am going back to a real 5 star hotel on my next trip to dublin. The room service took an age and the food was bland and expensive...for bland food, about normal for room service. The heavenley bed was good and it was dificult to fault the service when I was asleep.

202,highly recommended,"The location is one the best in Dublin if you want to walk around the city centre, although you pay 5 star prices you get 5 star service. The room was a decent size with a city view, clean & well equipped. I didn't use the restraunts only the bar but the service was good . The negatives include no complementary or adjacent parking, there was a small fitness room but no pool was available.The staff wwere polite & efficient.

202,Very good standards,"My wife and I stayed here for one night in June and enjoyed our stay.  The main reason we chose there was its location ‚Äì right in the centre of town, so we could valet park the car and avoid Dublin traffic and parking problems.  Everything is within walking or bus distance.  

As for the hotel itself, it meets the high standards one expects from the Westin brand ‚Äì very polite, skilled, and friendly staff (including a barman who could make off-menu cocktails without blinking an eye!), well appointed and well furnished rooms (perhaps a little on the small side), and a comfortable bar.  We didn‚Äôt eat in the hotel, but the restaurant has a good reputation.  The only quibble we had was the small business centre (a printer and two computers, one of which was out of order); aside from that, it was a good value and enjoyable stay.
",4,2006,07,02
202,Great Location and Service,"From arrival to check out the staff was attentive. The concierge is not as experienced as we expected from a hotel of this level. He was knowledgeable for visiting sites, but lacked well rounded knowledge of fine dining in Dublin. When asked for a recommendation they sent a very well tailored group in dinner jackets to a restaurant only requiring shorts and tee shirts. Rooms were immaculate and room service was superb. All around a positive experience.

202,Enjoyed our Stay,"Very much enjoyed our stay at the Westin. The rooms were very comfortable, the staff we found to be very helpful, and the location couldn't be better, We plan on returning!
",4,2006,06,06
202,Great hotel,"I am very surprised to see that the Westin in only rated as 4 and a half stars. I've stayed in many 5 star hotels around the world and the Westin could easily be a 5 star hotel. The room was very spacious and the  bed was fantastic. The room had nice touches like robes in the cupboard and a drawer with crystal glasses for drinks from the mini bar. Bathroom is also large and spacious and is a complete bathroom - i.e seprate bath and full shower. There are also ironing facilities in the room with an iron and board provided. 

The TV was good and the hotel's own channel of Blockbuster movies has latest hollywood releases at affordable prices. There was also a broadband unit in the room and a full size keyboard available as well.

The location is superb. It is right in the heart of the city centre, just minutes away from Temple Bar and Grafton Street. Also the hotel is situated on West Moreland street and most bus routes stop across the road from the hotel.

I travel to Dublin a lot and will now only stay at the Westin due to the lovely rooms and more specifically the location.

The only areas that can be improved is that I made my booking telephonically direct with the hotel and the receptionist could not understand English very well which resulted in a lengthy reservation. Secondly the breakfast is very average and well below a 5  or even 4 star standard. It is also extremely overpriced at approximately 20 euros per person.",5,2006,06,02

202,Great time at the Westin Dublin,"I stayed at the Westin Dublin for four nights and loved it.  The location is great with alot of sights within walking distance.  I took a ""Hop on Hop off"" bus tour which you can pick up right next door in front of Trinity College.  My room was a ""Mini Suite"" with a separate sitting area with T.V. and a desk; the bedroom also had a T.V.   I had breakfast every morning in the Exchange Restaurant.  It had a good selection of hot & cold foods and since breakfast was included in my rate, the price of breakfast (which I believe was 25 Euros) was not an issue, but is expensive if you are paying separately.  My waiter each morning was a young man from Estonia (I think his name was Andy) who was very friendly.  Since I was usually the only one there at 7 a.m., we would sit and talk before the restaurant became busy.  He was very well informed, spoke perfect English and was one of the most memorable things about my stay.  I hope to get back to Dublin soon and will make sure I stay at the Westin.

202,Mixed review,"Stayed for 2 nights at Easter.  Have to agree this hotel is in a good location with lots of bars and restaurants within an easy walk.  But... and here it is.  On the second day returned to our room late afternoon to find ourselves locked out.  Having activated the key again, we found a room that had seen no housekeeper all day (maybe they were lock out too!) When we enquired at reception we were told 'the housekeeper starts late on a Sunday'.  Someone did eventually come up and ask if we wanted the room cleaning, but not really convenient when you are in it.  

Have to agree with other reviews - nice hotel, good location but definately not 5 star.

202,Excellent hotel,"This is my third stay at the Westin.  The location, standard of accommodation, service, food and cleanliness are outstanding.  I would recommend this hotel without hesitation, and wouldn't consider staying anywhere else!
",5,2006,04,16
202,Confusion at the Westin Hotel,"While the hotel itself is very nice, the service is extremely poor.  When we checked into the hotel, the front desk clerks said they did not have our reservations because they had been canceled by central reservations.  This did not make sense, but we did not worry because they said they had room and would just re-do the reservation and check us in.  The next day we received no-show charges on our bill.  After touching base with the front desk, we were told they probably could not remove them, and then asked in a very polite tone if there was anything else they could help us with.  After attempting to explain again, that we obviously should not be charged a room charge and a no-show charge again, because we were standing right in front of them, we did not have much success.  It took several attempts to clear that one up.  The best part was we had two rooms and each day they checked one or both rooms out, would lock us out, and then we would have to go back to the front desk and explain, again, that we were staying for a week and would not be checking out that day or the next, etc.  Still was not fixed.  We did that everyday until we left.  Each day we received charges on our bill that were not ours, and we had to attempt to fix them each day, because they would check us out each day.  The final straw was when they could not get our room rates correct and kept asking if we had proof of our room rate.  Luckily, I had brought a copy of our reservation, because each day I had to show it to them, so they could make yet another copy, and then not fix it when they checked us out incorrectly that day.  It got to be a joke that we would just stop by and visit each day, ask for a new key, have them check us in again, and argue over the miscellaneous charges and incorrect rates.  It would not have been so bad if they did not have such an attitude about it, as though we kept making the mistake, not them.  The other problem was the concierge who could not help us with anything.  Anything we asked (example, where is a good restaurant nearby), he had no idea.  On the positive side, the bartenders Paul and Colin were excellent, extremely helpful and gave us the best advice.

202,wouldn't recommend,"Stayed here in early April mainly due to the Westin name...hadn't gone wrong with them before in other places.  Not so in this case.  The service was at best lackluster, the rooms were hot and stuffy and no way to control the air flow.  The resturant and bar were overpriced with slow service.  Wouldn't stay here again and wouldn't recommend.

202,Great Location and Great Service,"My husband and I stayed at the Westin Dublin for 5 nights in March and had wonderful time.  The staff was more than helpful and service oriented.  We had a wonderful room on the 4th floor (435) that overlooked some of Trinity College (other views were of the roofs below and a LOT of cranes with all of the construction going on in Dublin).   We absolutely LOVED the Atrium and would end our days sitting on one of the couches enjoying a Guinness and reading.  We walked everywhere in Dublin except from the airport (obviously) when we arrived and to the train station on our last day due to luggage.  The Westin is in a great location with wonderful service and extrememly friendly staff.

202,The Westin was great!,"My husband and I stayed at the Westin Dublin for two nights earlier this month.  We had a lovely stay.  We arrived from the U.S. and checked into the Westin at 9:30 on a Monday morning.  The staff was gracious enough to give us a room on the spot!  Needless to say, we were thrilled after having taken an overnight flight from Chicago.  The room was of a fine size and was very clean.  Additionally, all of the staff we encountered were very pleasant and helpful.  As far as the location, it cannot be beat.  It is literally across the street from the Temple Bar neighborhood which is replete with pubs and excellent restaurants.  Enjoy!

202,A Birthday Treat,"Have just returned following a two night stay at the Westin. Booked a Shoppers Delight package staying in one of the deluxe rooms (No.535) at a price of 270 Euros per night. Have had a wonderful stay and the service was very good.

When we got to the room, it appeared a little on the cool side and it did take a couple of telephone calls before we got the room to a more comfortable temperature. Prior to booking I had mentioned that the trip was a birthday present for my wife. On returning to the room on the Saturday evening, there was half a bottle of champagne awaiting us, chilling in an ice bucket. This was a really nice touch on the hotels behalf and one we thoroughly enjoyed. Afternoon tea was part of the package and this was delightful. Breakfast was included in the price, the orange juice was out of this world but I would say that keeping the food hot is something that could be improved upon as some of the hot food was looking a little bit frazzled by the time we sat down to eat. 

Nevertheless we had a great time in Dublin and would certainly return to the Westin.
",4,2006,03,28
202,Great Location and Great Room,"Hotel prices in Dublin are, as my Irish grandmother used to say, ""dear"" and I was happy to get the Westin Dublin by using Priceline because of the hotel's great location across the street from Trinity College and the Temple Bar area.  The lowest price on the Westin's own Web site was (without breakfast) Euro 192 plus tax (which is around $235 plus tax). The room was very nice with a comfy and very heavenly bed.  There is a small healthclub that is open 24/7, which was great for me--a person who six months ago decided to focus on personal fitness.  The rate I paid did not include breakfast, which was fine since it gave me the chance to check out some of the local breakfast joints.  Also, the basement bar was jumping on the weekend nights that I was there and seemed to be a local hotspot.  Interestingly, the Radisson Dublin offered a rate of Euro 108 (around $130) just a couple of days before my scheduled arrival. The Radisson hotel is not in the center of Dublin and a fifteen minute train ride outside the city center--though might be worth a look. The AirCoach between the airport and Dublin city center has a stop right across the street from the Westin and is just Euros 12 for a round-trip ticket (around fifteen bucks). The Westin was great for the price I paid!  Used the A-B link, of course.
",4,2006,03,25
202,Excellent stay,"Could not have been happier with recent stay: 3 nights at the start and then one night at the end of a 10 day trip to Ireland. The staff was professional yet very warm, welcoming and helpful; the rooms were spotless and most comfortable and the location could not be better. I would skip the breakfast as it is overpriced and not exceptional. But everything else about the stay was absolutely great. I will look forward to a return visit and would highly recommend the hotel.
",5,2006,03,22
202,"Great Location, Wonderful Staff","Just returned from a week long business trip to Dublin and had a wonderful stay in the Westin.  After reading some of the recent negative reviews of this hotel, I was apprehensive but those fears were  put to rest immediately.  From the moment we checked in, the staff was friendly and attentive.  The Concierge was particularly helpful in recommending dining locations.  My co-worker's room was a tad smaller than mine due to layout but the bathroom was perfect with a spa tub and separate shower stall (a big plus).   Bottled water and filled ice buckets were provided each evening which was another bonus.   You could not have a better location in Dublin, directly across the street from the Temple Bar District (Don't miss Oliver St John Gogarty's), Trinity College and a block from Grafton Street.    I would highly recommend this hotel and plan to stay here again.
",4,2006,03,15
202,Absolutely fantastic stay at the Westin...,"We booked our 2 day stay at very quick notice online....but from the minute we entered the hotel, it was just great from there on!  Our room was average size but the bathroom was very nice with a fantastic shower....that was just like a mini sauna when you went in!  We had a quick bite in the Mint Bar on the Fri nite and had a really nice snack there and the staff were very quick....even though the bar was very busy.  On Sat night we booked the restaurant and i must say, it was by far the nicest meal i ever had...the beef was the best!  Our German waiter was very chatty and very professional.  We had a lovely tea and scone on the sun morn in the lounge and read the sunday papers, and checking out (which was a relief that it was 12 for check-out and not 11am!!) was so quick and our car at the front door and ready to go!  The 20 euro a day for the parking wasn't mentioned at check-in but the stay was so nice...it didn't really bother us.  Being so close to Grafton street and O'Connell st....it was a perfect location..
Can't wait to go back!
",5,2006,03,07
202,Only good thing here is location,"Spent a night here recently.  Have tried out almost all the good hotels in Dublin and had been put off the Westin becuase it did not have parking facilities on site.  However, was in Dublin by air so decided to try it.  For the price it was very dissapointing.  The only good thing was it's location in the city centre.  However, I would definitely recommend the Four Seasons or Merrion over it.  

No staff to greet you when you arrive.  Nobody offered to help with bags.  Room was very small, extremely low ceilings, and heating could not be controlled.  

There was a fire alert during the night and while this was executed efficiently, I had assumed that on check-out the following morning, it would at least be apologised for.  However, when nothing was mentioned I questioned what happened and the checkout staff were unaware that the whole building was evacuated at 3 am in the morning!!  Surely they should have been briefed on this.  

For the money - stay in either of the above hotels - Four Seasons is best but slightly out, Merrion is almost city centre.
",2,2006,02,28
202,Westin on Priceline Rate,"My wife and I stayed at the Weston from Feb. 17-20 and were very pleased with the room and service. We found the front desk staff to be quite helpful and responsive. However, we did not eat in the hotel so are unable to comment on this aspect of the hotel. The location was excellent for all of our activities. We took several tours. The Wild Wicklow tour was great fun and quite informational...our guide was Ita (sp) and she was a real hoot. Once again, our stay at the Weston needs to be tempered by the price we paid on Priceline...200.00 U.S..  Very fair we felt !!
",4,2006,02,27
202,great bed- bad food,"This Westin had great beds and bedding. The rooms were very, very small and when I used points then it was 30-40000 on American Express. When I looked recently it was 90,000. I would rather pay and would for another hotel. The location is good but how ridiculous to think it was worth 3 and then some flights in-country per night. The service in the bar was absolutely awful. 15 minutes to get some sodas. One hour and change for food. The staff in the lobby was very full of themselves except for Patrick who helped us pre-trip and during with arrangements. My room was clean and not worn but the lobby was very active and could have been more up to date.",3,2006,02,21
202,Excellent Hotel,"Having recently stayed at The Westin Dublin for our 1st wedding anniversary we would highly recommend the hotel. We booked a four night stay in a deluxe room and were delighted with the room, service and hotel generally.

The service was attentive and polite, but not overbearing as found in many American hotels, and we found the staff to be very friendly. The hotel was very clean and smart, and we enjoyed a few drinks in the bar (at comparable prices to local pubs - which was great). We didn't eat in the hotel, but had so much choice within easy walking distance - would highly recommend Jacob's Ladder.

Our room was lovely with a very comfortable bed, and large well appointed bathroom with both bath and seperate shower. We had a street view but the double glazing kept the noise out.

Don't be put off by the negative reviews, but maybe consider a deluxe room if possible.

Would definitely go back!
",5,2006,02,13
202,"Dreadful, dreadful, dreadful","Further bad reviews of this hotel are hardly necessary but...... The hotel is dingy, the staff were at best incompetent and at worst, downright rude. The hotel seems to concentrate its efforts on passing trade (bar and restaurant) rather than hotel guests. The food is inedible and all complaints were either argued aggressively or ignored. Here, the customer is never right. Don't be fooled by the Westin name. We have stayed in other Westin hotels across the US which are of a very good standard. The Dublin hotel doesn't come close.

However, what is most distressing is that a weekend in this awful hotel cost us more than a subsequent stay in the elegant, luxurious and truly 5 star  Dublin Four Seasons Hotel.

To be fair, if the hotel was rated 2-3 star and charged accordingly, this review would be less vitriolic. We have never left a hotel anywhere in the world feeling more ripped off! Avoid this place like the plague.
",1,2006,02,03
202,Not a five star hotel!,"I stayed in the Westin for 10 days on a business trip to Dublin in January.  The hotel was booked by our corporate travel center at the negotiated company rate.

Rooms: My small room was facing the inside courtyard of the hotel which meant: no natural light and windows could not be opened.  The room had a musty smell and was always so warm that I had to put on the loud air conditioning to get any air moving at all.  The carpet was dingy and warn in the traffic areas.  The bathroom was basicly clean but the tile grouting was yellow.

Breakfast: I found it was was very poor.  The fruit salad tasted like it was fermenting. Waffles and eggs were cold.  Pancakes were not replenished. Lots of sugary sweets.  No cheese and the cold cuts looked old. I spoke to the service staff which were painfuly embarassed but did nothing.  I had breakfast at the hotel only twice in the 10 days I was there although it was included in the rate of my room. Go to the many friendly cafes in the area. 

Public Areas: Were OK but no great atmosphere. Carpets were warn, upholstry was thin in areas and used. Poor lighting not suitable for reading.  

Service: Lacking the professional service expected at an internatonal worldwide chain.
",2,2006,01,31
202,Outstanding Hotel,"This place is great!! I read a bunch of reviews about poor service but experienced just the opposite.  The staff of this outstanding hotel did everything in their power to make my stay memorable.  They were prompt, friendly, and went out of their way to make me feel welcome.  The hotels location is probably the best in City Centre.   You are across the street from Trinity College, Temple Bar, Grafton Street, and nearly everything Dublin has to offer.  I cannot recommend this hotel enough to anyone looking for a great hotel in Dublin.  

The rooms were a good size and the beds were great.  The bathrooms were large and very tidy.  Choose the Westin Dublin if you want a great hotel experience when visiting Dublin.
",5,2006,01,17
202,Expensive breakfast!,"After reading reviews on the Westin on this site, we didn't have very high hopes and it was too late to change our booking, so we went anyway. 

Our room was tiny, with an interconnecting door to the room next door - we heard every sound our neighbour (who we didn't know) made. From her zipping up her bag, to the drunken row she had with her boyfriend at 2am in the morning! Our room service breakfast was a total ripoff and cold and they'd forgotten the butter for the toast. I'd highly recommend Bewleys for breakfast instead (five minute walk away on Grafton Street) for a heavenly breakfast for half the price.

The newspaper we ordered never came on the saturday or the sunday and when we complained about all the above, all we got was a flimsy apology from a foreign staff member. The couple next to us checking out were also complaining!

Generally very disappointing, we won't be returning.
",3,2006,01,11
202,Bigger bed next time,"Even though we are Dubliners, we stayed in the Westin on New Year's Eve. We checked in in the afternoon and the service was very good, plus we got a glass of champagne which was very nice. I rang in advance to book a car parking space, but I wasn't told over the phone that the charge was ‚Ç¨20 for the night! Only when my car was being parked did they mention it.

Anyway, the room was nice, not huge but comfortable. I expected a little more from a five star hotel however. The view looked over Trinity and College Green, which was great. 

The bathroom was nice but the shower kept going cold and hot and cold again which was annoying. We headed to the Mint bar before going out; watch out for those cocktails as they cost nearly a tenner! And the beers are generally over 5 euros.

We returned late after ringing in the new year, looking forward to our ""heavenly bed"". However, heavenly was the last thing that crossed our minds. The mattress was so soft that anytime one of us turned over, we risked rolling the other off the bed! Being a queen sized bed, we found it quite small as we are used to a king. I would've expected big beds to be the norm in a five star hotel. We had a very bad sleep.

We got breakfast in bed the following morning, and, like every hotel I have ever stayed in the world over, the toast was cold. Is there no one willing to invent something to keep toast hot?? Paying ‚Ç¨20 each for the privilage of breakfast (about 6 slices of cold toast, two crossaints, two danishes, a small cereal bowl and a pot of coffee) didn't exactly make me feel any better. We should've gone to a local cafe and got something we knew would be good.

So we checked out and our car was waiting at the front, however I had to adjust the seat back to my own driving position and turn the radio off when I started the car. I didn't really expect staff at five star hotels to start fiddling with your seat and your radio as they park your car. As I drove off home I was slightly irritated that we had paid nearly ‚Ç¨300 for what amounted to a fairly average stay.

202,Don't stay over christmas,"We stayed at the Westin fromm DEc 26 to Dec 31.  We had come in to see Christy Moore sing at the Point.  We found out later in the week that the head concierge had given all his front dest Irish staff four days off.  The concierge we tried to deal with was a traine with poor command of english who knew nothing about Dublin..  My wife asked if he could arrange a trip to the neolithic tomb at New Grange, and he asked if it was a restaurant in town.  WE used internet access to make arrangements until the other staff returned.  The internet access was 28 euro ($35) a DAY.  On leaving, our bill included 20 items from the mini-bar, when we had used two.  I was told the refrigerator had electronic sensors, that charged every time an item was picked up, even if it was just moved or returned.  They removed the charges, but it made a distastfull end to the stay.  The positive is that the physical facility is excellent, but the other problems left a bad overall impression.  Won't stay there again.
",2,2006,01,01
202,Westin Consistency in Ireland,"We recently had a long weekend at The Westin Dublin.  It was great.  We flew in early Friday morning and arrived at the Hotel around 9:30 AM.  They did not have our room ready for us (as we expected) but promised that they would do their best to have it between 12 and 1.  We checked back at 5 minutes to 12 and they had it ready and had our bags sent up.  We had booked a Junior Suite and it was very nice, on the top floor (5th) of the hotel.  It was a very large room with a nice sitting area with a sofa, armchair and 2 large ottomans.  The bathroom was huge and had a separate standup shower (which was rather small by American standards but over the top by Euro standards) and more than usable and nice.  It also had a large soaking tub and lots of space to spread out.

Naturally, the Heavenly Bed was as advertised - Heavenly!  Everything else was great, our chambermaid did an excellent job and always seemed to get in to do her work as soon as we left in the morning and get out by the time we were back.  

The Mint Bar was pretty cool although the service in there was pretty bad on Sat. night.  It was crowded but we were pretty much ignored at the bar for 20 minutes while others were walking in and getting served.  Finally one of the waitresses came over and served us.  

Overall, the Westin is solid and as nice, if not nicer, than any other we have stayed in other parts of the world.  It is luxury but not over the top.  Very comfortable and easy to relax in.  A bit expensive but you do get what you pay for.
",5,2005,12,15
202,"Excellent hotel, room and service","We stayed at the Westin for 3 nights in early September. About a week before arrival, we upgraded our room to a deluxe. Checking in at 11.00am was not a problem. I advised the clerk at check in that we had our 6 month old son with us, so the bigger the room the better. He graciously checked us into a huge room with 3 separate seating areas, and views of the rear of the hotel, which partly looks onto Trinity. The marble bathroom was spacious and luxurious. The bed was as good as any other Westin. We did not eat in the hotel but did try the Mint Bar in the basement, which was very nice, and not too badly priced for a hotel bar. We had originally planned on staying two nights, but liked it so much we asked for a third night, which they gave us at the same price, even though the hotels in the city were at capacity due to Ireland v. France match. Overall the staff were extremely professional and polite. We will definitely be staying at the Dublin Westin again.
",5,2005,11,03
202,Perfect location!,"After nearly two weeks traveling around Ireland we ended our trip with 3 nights at the Westin.  Our stay at the Westin and the City of Dubiln were the highlights of our trip,  The hotel could not be more perfectly located, next to Trinity College (be sure to see the Book of Kells!), and within minutes of Temple Bar and Grafton Street.  The rooms are equipped with everything you could possibly need, robes, coffee maker, mini bar, hair dryer, safe, internet connections, in room movies, etc.    Our first night complimentary slippers were left for us, and each night two bottles of mineral water and glasses were supplied.  There was a nice reception one night with a sample of Guinness and seafood.  Staff was very helpful as well.  Would definitely stay here again.
",5,2005,11,02
202,Nice Stay,"We enjoyed our stay at the Westin from October 20-24. Service was very nice - everyone at the hotel was friendly and helpful. The Atrium is a nice lounge for tea in the afternoon and drinks at night and The Mint has a happening bar scene, although the Friday night latin music and dancing feature is not my cup of tea.

We stayed in a standard room - tried to get an upgrade for months to no avail. Our room was a strange shape and looked over the Atrium, so no great city views. The bed was comfortable, but the room design was really strange and there was no closet space at all until we moved the terry robes and ironing board to make room for a few hanging garments.

We did have one interesting incident - when we asked the concierge for a restaurant recommendation, he gave us a suggestion for Brownes. When he tried to make a reservation for 7:30 p.m. he was told they had a 6:30 seating or a 9:30 seating. Then he told us that most restaurants in Dublin only have two seatings. Never having visited Dublin, we thought this was true and made our reservation for 6:30 p.m. As it turned out, we were the only people there at 6:30 and had to wait until they opened the doors. And, the restaurant was not busy, and others arrived at 7:00 and 7:30 and 8:00, so clearly we received incorrect information. So, clearly there was an issue with the validity of this information. 

Overall, this was a nice 4 star hotel, and I would recommend it for it's location and service, but beware of the information provided by the concierge.
",4,2005,10,25
202,Wow...fantastic place!,"Just come back from a weekend at the Westin. Beautiful hotel, good location and one of the best I have stayed in..

Walking into the reception, you are blown away with the grandess and beauty of the roaring fires. The staff are polite, make you feel at ease and very helpful. The rooms are a nice size, very clean, lovely furniture and a delight to stay in. The bathroom was lovely, large cubicle shower and seperate bath! only slight grunt with the room, that mine didnt look out into the outside but only into the atrium of the hotel, but nothing to worry about.

If you go, try the Mint Bar.. a bar in the old vault of the hotel. Very contemporary, relaxed and great cocktails.

Overall, one of the best places i have had the pleasure of staying in. Dead opposite is a stop for the ""Air coach"" to the airport, only 14 euros, so saves a few shillings on the taxi ride.

Try it and enjoy the luxury.. makes a wonderful city even more gracious.

202,"Nice gaff, odd location","There's an air of calm the moment you walk into the elegant reception of the Westin - which you'll welcome, having put your life on the line to reach the front door. I can't think of an odder location for a five star anywhere: in the midst of Dublin's unique take on traffic madness. 

The charming multi-national staff soon put you at your ease, however, and can't do enough for you. The upstairs lounge bar is a particularly nice place to chill. One gripe: breakfast just ain't up to scratch for a five star. Cold scrambled eggs, at that price? Please.
",4,2005,10,17
202,Westin no more!!,"The standard of the rooms and the quality of the service fell way below what you would expect of a 5* establishment. We phoned ahead and advised them that we would want to check in at 12.30 approx. We were told no problem yet on our arrival we were informed that we couldn't check in until 2.30. The hotel does not have adequate parking facilities despite boasting 'valet parking'. We were informed that the hotel car park was 'full' and were directed to a public car park 2/3 streets away. We had a deluxe room which was not very spacious and extremely stuffy. The windows were locked shut and couldn't be opened despite our room being on the 5th floor. The final straw was when we arrived for our breakfast in the morning at 10.20 to be told that they had stopped serving. None of the staff apart from the gentleman who opened the door for us on our departure were pleasant. The reason we booked this 5* hotel is because when you book 5* there are not meant to be any problems..............we experienced nothing only problems.
",1,2005,09,13
202,An experience to be had...,"It's not often that I go on a business trip and come away with fond memories of the hotel.  Usually as long as the sheets and bathroom are clean that's enough for me.  Lets just say the Westin Dublin met that basic criteria and then blew me away.
When I checked in my room was not ready but the front desk was willing to go the extra mile and search for another room.  When was found she was honest enough to tell me that my original room was better and worth the wait if I wasn't in a hurry.  Since I wasn't in a hurry she kindly took my bag and told me it would be in my room when I was ready to move in.
I needed to use the internet to get a phone number and she actually allowed me behind the desk to login to hotmail and get the number.
Dinner was superb.  The staff was attentive, friendly, and eager to please.
Breakfast had an amazing selection and everything was fresh and delicious.  And the service was just as pleasant and attentive as the evening before.
I'd recommend this hotel to friends, family and colleagues making their way to Dublin.
",5,2005,07,21
202,fantastic hotel,"The Westin hotel is in an ideal location, opposite to Temple Bar and seconds from Grafton Street, where all the shops are. We chose to take the aircoach transfer service to and from the airport, which we would recommend as it stops directly outside the Westin. The hotel was very clean and provide a comfortable stay. We didn't use any of the hotel bars but they looked very nice. We stayed on a bed and breakfast basis, the restaurant where breakfast was served was pleasant and there was a variety of different types of breakfasts to choose from. The staff were helpful taking our luggage to our room for us, although this should be expected from a 5 star hotel anyway. I would recommend that you take a map with you and the address of your hotel as bus drivers tend to confuse it with the Best Western Hotel. If I was to return to Dublin again I would stay at the Westin hotel without hesitation.
",4,2005,07,09
202,"Ohhhhhhhh ""The Westin"" big deal.........?","The location of the hotel is really great.  Go to the corner cross the street and you are heading into the Temple Bar area.  I just don't feel that for the money the Westin was worth it.  We had contacted the hotel many months in advance and had requested an early check-in because we would be traveling for almost 15 hours.  They of course did not have our room ready and there was nothing open that time of day.  Our room was very hot and stuffy in the evening when we would return and we would have to call down to get them to turn on our air conditioning that took 30 or more minutes to even get the room cooled off so we could relax with ease.  I just think that with a 5 ***** hotel like this you should be able to expect more than that!
",3,2005,06,13
202,The Westin Is Wonderful,"Went to Dublin for a brief vacation after business in London.  The Westin was an outstanding hotel choice.

From what I can tell many of the rooms are unusual in shape and size, and we had one of the smaller ones.  Despite that, it was very comfortable and clean.  If you have the chance, go for one of the suites named after famous Irish writers, they seemed to be of the best size on the map.  

The Heavenly bed was just that after walking around this fine city all day.  The bath was very nice, powerful shower, and nice marble throughout.  We avoided eating in the hotel, as breakfast, lunch and dinner could all be had within short walks at a fraction of the price.  Example: breakfast at Westin was 25 Euros, same breakfast at Wolenskys two blocks away was 9 Euros.

For those who care like I do, the hotel has high-speed wi-fi access, which is good, but pricey at 28 Euros per day.

The location of the Westin can not be beat.  Right near Trinity College and Temple Bar, it seemed like we were in the middle of everything.  I recommend one the Dublin City Tour buses when you arrive, it helps you get your bearings and helps you figure out what you want to do in this fabulous city, all in about 2 hours.  Also highly recommend pub crawling through Temple Bar, grab a pint of Guinness and listen to the live music.

We loved Dublin and loved the Westin.  Would stay here again for sure.

202,Great hotel in a great location!,"My friend and I just returned from a 4-night stay at the Westin in Dublin and we were very pleased with the entire experience.  We originally booked at the Temple Bar Hotel, but after reading the reviews from this web site, we changed our plans at the last minute and chose this hotel - thank goodness because when we saw the Temple Bar Hotel we were very happy we changed.  Here are some of the take-aways we have from our stay at the Westin Dublin Hotel:

1.  We requested an early check-in, and in fact arrived at 6:15 a.m. - they had no problem accommodating the request, thankfully because we had zero sleep and needed to get in a couple hours sleep before hitting the Temple Bar area!

2.  The accommodations were very nice, clean and good quality- we had a room overlooking the Atrium and it was very quiet and we had 4 nights of uninterrupted sleep (very important!)

3.  The heavenly bed is, well......HEAVENLY!

4.  Water pressure was great, lots of room in the shower for spreading out all the various toiletries (I'm sure you can tell this message is coming from the female gender!!)

5.  Mint Bar/Atrium restaurant - very nice!

6.  Concierge staff was very helpful and offered good suggestions of the ""must see"" things during our short visit.

7.  If ever in Dublin again, I would definitely stay here again...

202,Great Location but better value available in Central Dublin,"We stayed in the Westin for a weekend recently, combining business and pleasure.
Although the location is second to none and the staff very friendly there were a number of problems.
Firstly, the language barrier, although the staff are no doubt superbly trained we found problems communicating our needs to the housekeeping staff who are mostly Eastern European/ Asian. Although they all spoke some English there were a few confusing episodes when our requests were not understood.
Also, we needed to use the business centre but apparently there isn't one.. unusual for a business hotel.
Thirdly, it is not immediately apparent that a 21% tax will be added to the bill on checkout. This is not usual in Irish hotels and we would have appreciated if it had been transparent from the beginning.
These things aside, the Mint Bar is great and the Cosmopolitans were expertly made by very friendly and helpful barmen. The rooms are well equipped and the bathrooms are excellent. And the restaurant is very good with a great view of bustling dublin outside.
In all this is a good hotel but overall I think there's better value available in other 5 star hotels in Dublin.",3,2005,05,22
202,"Fantastic hotel, super location, great rooms, what more do you want?","My fiancee' and I decided to visit Dublin for a romantic break. We selected the Westin as the reviews on the site were very good. We couldn't have wished for a better hotel, the staff are very friendly, location fantastic and the rooms are excellent. We would definitely recommend this hotel to any couple wanting to find a hotel for a super weekend away.

202,"Great location,excellent service,average accomodations","My husband and I stayed one night on the 30th April,the staff could not have been friendlier or the location better.  However, I stay regularly in 5 star hotels in Dublin and the bedrooms of this hotel are just not up to standard... they are more of a four star and a tired one at that! 
The only real complaint was the car parking fee which was neither stated on the web site nor were we informed when booking in that one would be incurred.

202,Westin Hotel,"My husband and I have just returned from a great weekend in Dublin - we were there for a rugby match.  The Westin Hotel was excellent and the staff could not do enough for us and were extremely friendly and efficient.  We had a very late check-in (9.30pm) because of a flight delay but that didn't cause a problem.  

We would heartily recommend this hotel to anyone.  It's not cheap - but you get what you pay for!  Plus their restaurant is just great too.

I notice that another review mentioned that this hotel seemed to be corporate-orientated but I totally disagree.  

This hotel is also central for visiting everything in Dublin - easy walking distance to virtually everywhere you want to visit.

202,"Great Hotel, Service","Concierge was excellent! Room and shower was very, very nice. Good food in the restaurants. No complaints. Stayed during St. Patricks day with no problems. Great location too.
",5,2005,03,31
202,ok hotel and bad service!,"We booked and paid more for a deluxe king room. When we arrived they told us that the beds were not guarentee and they but us in a queen room that was very small and oddly shaped. The bed was smash in a corner between the window and the nightstand. You couldnt even get out of bed unless you exited at the foot of the bed. Manangement told us we had no other option because of the price we paid and we booked it online!
   The next day we got the true story. They were overbooked and since we didnt arrive until later that day, they gave our room to someone else.The mgr advised them the night before not to upgrade us to other available rooms but to make us stay in the bad room (we were told by staff).  Only because I'm 6months pregnant did they switch us the following day to the room we paid for. 
   The hotel was nice but not quite up to Westin standards.
",2,2005,03,29
202,Comfort in a Great Location,"If you are looking for very nice, comfortable hotel located in a perfect spot in Dublin, this is it.

We stayed there in September of 2004, and the experience was great.  The staff was extremely helpful and directed our group to several outstanding restaurants.  The location is literally next to everything one wants to see in Dublin  - Trinity College, Grafton Street, the Temple Bar area, St. Stephen's Green.   Plus, there is a great pub in the basement.  Some rooms have great views of Trinity College while others do not, but its in the middle of an urban area so most buildings, including most other hotels, will have their views obstructed by other buildings.

Finally, the Westin Heavenly Beds and Heavenly Baths make this one of the most comfortable hotels I've visited in Europe.  I'd highly recommend it.
",5,2005,03,16
202,Westin is not the Bestin!!!,"I live in Dublin and surprised my wife for her birthday.I paid a lot of hard earned money to get a very small room overlooking a ROOF!!!.Staff were o.k. but if I arrived in a bentley they would have been so much nicer!!!!get the drift!!! No late bar! Only good thing was the late checkout as we were in no hurry home to the children.Book in to a bed and breakfast and go to Chapter One in Parnell Square and have a decent meal!!
",1,2005,02,25
202,Most enjoyable,"Just returned from a weekend break at the Westin. I am a regular at their Starwood Partner Hotel in London and I was certainly not disappointed in Dublin.

Very central location at the end of O'Connel Street and adjacent to Trinity College. If arriving by air, around 30 Euro's ($38) by taxi from the airport.

Also very convenient for Dublins NightLife as the ""Cultural Centre"" - Temple Bar - starts literally across the road. 

Despite a very busy street outside, the hotel is a haven of calm with extremely comfortable public areas and well furnished and presented rooms (Molton Brown toiletries) and every convenience. 

Staff were very helpful and in typical Irish fashion, very friendly with good advice about places to visit and pub's to try.

Have no hesitation in recommending this for either business or pleasure, and I can confirm that room service breakfast is a ""must""!
",5,2005,02,21
202,"great location, nice place","My husband and I stayed there last November.  He is a Starwood Platinum member, so we did get an upgrade to a suite overlooking Trinity College.  The rooms were nice, staff very nice, and the location was great - right near Temple Bar, Trinity.  There is also a cool pub downstairs that was fun.  Definately recommended!

202,Excellent Hotel and I was not corporate,"Excellent hotel and I was not there as a corporate business guest. Stayed over the weekend No complaints. Food great room service great and very friendly staff always there and ready to help no matter.
",5,2005,01,25
202,Very nice hotel,"I stayed here on business for a few nights in Cctober 2003.  It was a very nice hotel and consistent with the standards of other Westins.  Check-in was friendly and efficient although we had just flown for 28 hours from the Land of Oz to get there!  Rooms were on the small side though which made it ia bit tricky to get a big bag in and opened etc.  Decor was on the fussy side for me but ok.  Meals in the restaurant were good.  I'd stay there again.
",5,2005,01,14
202,Brilliant room service!,"I stayed for one night back in September 04 and enjoyed my stay so much I am taking my hubby there over hristmas for a long wekend. Nothing was too much bother - not even a vanila milkshake late at night, served on a silver tray with a couple of strwberries!
Did not have time to try the bars or restaurant (will do next time) but breakfast was of a high standard.
",5,2004,12,13
202,"Unfriendly, unless you're a corporate guest","We were just in Dublin for a long weekend.  Stayed at the Morrison and the Merrion, which were both excellent.  We found ourselves walking past the Westin, so we decided to pop in and have a look -- for future reference, in case we decide to visit Dublin again.

As we walked into the lobby, a woman hotel employee immediately followed us and asked if we needed help.  This was NOT said in a friendly way -- she was obviously posted there to discourage people like us from walking around the hotel.  She then told us in no uncertain terms not to loiter about, as there were some corporate meetings going on!

As the previous reviewer said, there were some large conventions in the hotel that weekend, so (apparently) scum like us who walked in off the street, as well as the non-corporate guests, were made to feel like poor relations.  I don't recall ever being made to feel like a trespasser in a Westin hotel.  We were dressed well, so I don't think that hotel employee could have mistaken us for homeless people looking to use the restrooms.

Walking out of that horrible hotel, we gave thanks that we had the luck to choose the Merrion instead.  Even aside from that unfortunate experience, the Westin feels very corporate -- and the fact that they will happily place their corporate guests' needs over those of leisure travelers proves that's where their real interests lie.
",1,2004,11,30
202,Extremely unimpressed,"We are writing to complain about our stay this weekend at the Westin in Dublin. On arrival Friday night, we asked what time we could eat in restaurant, only to be told that the restaurant was shut to hotel guests for both Friday & Saturday night for private functions!!! We were directed to the Mint Bar downstairs as an alternative source of food. However being Friday night it was absolutely heaving with people and it was not the ambience required by us after a 15 hour day and flight. I have to say that our idea of a 3 course meal at a 5* hotel does not include burger, or associated bar snacks as per the Mint menu, nice though I'm sure they are! We were told we could go out, but again, what we wanted was a nice meal in a 5* hotel not fight our way through the weekenders out for a wet Friday night in Temple Bar!! So on Friday night, we ended up sharing a sandwich and a cheeseboard in the Atrium bar. Saturday morning after excellent sleep in lovely bed (one of main reasons we go to Westin hotels), came down to find we had to wait in a queue for 20 minutes to even be allocated a table-not exaggerated- we timed it!! When we went to get our cooked breakfast-there was no sausage or bacon left, so my husband had mushrooms and potato, and i had a croissant! The pregnant woman in the  queue by us was none too happy at this state of affairs either. Anyhow, we went into town, came back at 3.30 pm to have a lie down to find the room had not been cleaned nor the bed made!! At this point, we asked to speak to the duty manager. He came out to talk to us and he informed us that rooms are cleaned any time between 9am and 5pm!! We have stayed at a number of 5* hotels over the past few years and have never walked in at 3.30 pm to find the room untouched!! We then asked him why we could not eat in the restaurant on either night, and was informed that someone had booked the whole ""Exchange "" restaurant for a function- he said 120 people, and that as this was good business sense then they got the booking. He said it was better to have 120 people eating in the restaurant like that, than 30 or 40 people, which is what they might normally get from hotel guests!! We asked what about the other residents staying in the hotel-surely it is not good business sense to turf them out if they have paid good money to stay in a 5* hotel?- hardly likely to be singing the praises of Starwood hotels as a result we would think! Firstly, why should we have to go out to eat? The Westin prides itself on being a premier hotel-how can it possibly call itself this when the facilities that are on offer on the internet and its advertisements, are not actually available to guests staying at the hotel?!!  We said to him that although we thought Dublin was lovely, there is no way we would consider staying at the Westin there again, and we would not be recommending it to our friends and business colleagues either- we were appalled at how the guests were treated-in a 5* hotel, there should be no reason to complain. Anyway the room was then cleaned within about 40 minutes and we carried on. We booked a meal at another hotel,(Morrisons Hotel) which by the way, cost us 8 euros each way in a taxi and prior to going, my husband went down to order us a cocktail in the Atrium Bar, to find that not only was the Exchange Restaurant shut, so was the Atrium Bar for ""a private function!!!!"", although the sign outside the Exchange Restaurant stated that although it was closed the Atrium Bar was open!! So now, we have no nice quiet cocktail bar and no restaurant!!!!  The Mint Bar was as usual, heaving and not we came to the Westin for-peace and relaxation!!!  We had a lovely meal at the other hotel,and were given some names of quality hotels in Dublin by the taxi drivers, for when we return. This morning (Sunday), we queued yet again for breakfast, and after 10 minutes we were offered to go through to the Banking Hall for breakfast as an option rather than stay in the queue. There was a limited breakfast selection there, and when I asked if I could have some fruit, I was pointed in the direction of 8 slices of watermelon and half a dozen berries!! (The previous day, when we were finally seated the choice of fruit and compotes etc was excellent, which at least part made up for the lack of bacon and sausage- which did eventually turn up but not until we had even seated for about 10 minutes, by which time, we had assumed no more was forthcoming).
On arrival we had asked if we could keep the room later on Sunday as our flight back was not til the evening. The hotel had said we could stay until 4pm free of charge, which was fine by us. We therefore went out Sunday morning, and on return at 3pm, found a message on our TV reminding us we should have vacated at 12pm. I phoned down to say that we had arranged this on Friday night, and the receptionist asked me(bearing in mind we had dealt with this on Friday) ""Was  I a Starwood Preferred Guest and if I was, what level was I?""!  I replied that yes I was but could not remember what level,as I had not taken my card. She then asked ""Have you a name?"" which I presume referred to who I spoke to on Friday-her whole manner was again inappropriate for any hotel-let alone one of this supposed calibre.
Although we had a lovely time in Dublin, the whole weekend was marred by this stream of petty annoyances from the Westin. We maintain that if someone has booked a function for 120 people, surely they should be using the Banking Hall, and leaving the Exchange Restaurant for the other hotel residents? Or as happened in other quality hotels we know, if the main restaurant is booked for a function, then an alternative room is turned over to a restaurant for residents instead?Surely although we all acknowledge coroprate business is important,it is equally important to look after your ""bread and butter"" customers who return year after year? The Westins are hotels we hold in high regard, and we would hope that is not indicative of the change in standards in general.

202,Perfect!,"Stayed at the Westin in Dublin for one night in October.  Could not have asked for more.  Perfect central location, wonderful conceirge,  beautiful lobby and common areas. Requested an early check in and late check out, done.  Being a Starwood Preferred Guest, we were upgraded to one of their ""Library Suites"" .  Nicely appointed king bedded room with a spiral staircase up to a spacious sitting area complete with TV, desk, couch, chairs and many books (hence ""Library Suite"").  Large bathroom done in tasteful marble.  Separate shower and tub.  Our room faced a busy street but yet we never heard any traffic noise.   I'm hard to please when it comes to hotels and I recommend this one very highly.
",4,2004,10,19
202,"Overpriced, small rooms, High Tea in Atrium was highlight","I booked a Delux double room as the normal rooms were fully booked. I got a twin room which was very cramped. The amenities in the room were not of a 5star level either. The room was very hot and stuffy also and the Fan did not make any appreciable difference. If this was a delux room I would hate to see the normal rooms.
When I arrived I was told that I should have reserved car parking space and that there would be a charge of E19 per night. I was not made aware of this in advance and the hotel car park was full. At more than E300 for a night the least I would expect is complimentary car parking.

The best thing I can say about the hotel is that the staff are friendly and High Tea in the Atrium is not to be missed.

Conclusion - this was definitely not a 5 star experience.

202,"Great Hotel, Great Location","Fantastic location, 2 minute walk from Grafton Street, 5 mins from O Connell Street, opposite Temple bar area.

All in all a great hotel, great location....best in Dublin

202,"Not the best, but OK","I stayed at the Westin during the first week of October, 2004.  I found a special rate (buy 2 nights, get 1 free) on the Westin web site.  When I checked into the hotel, I realized that this rates puts me in a special category - for example, when I asked about turn down service, the person at the front desk told me that was for ""special guests"" only.  When I requested it anyway, they merely placed a room service menu on my pillow.   They also put me in a very small room, although it did overlook Trinity College which was nice.    The room was lovely overall (except for the size) with a great big bathroom.  The so-called heavenly bed was not heavenly and was in fact uncomfortable.  The service was OK - not the friendly Irish service I found at the Westbury or Clarence though.
",4,2004,10,09
202,A Great Hotel!!,"We just returned from three nights at the Westin Hotel in Dublin.  The hotel was fantastic, and you should not even think of staying anyplace else if this hotel is in your price range.  The location is perfect, and the service is as friendly as you'll find anywhere.  The hotel itself is a reconverted bank, and the rooms are modern and spacious.  We had a standard room and were afraid that it might be lacking in amentities.  Actually, the standard room at the Westin would be a deluxe room anywhere else.  Try to get the full Irish breakfast included in your rate, since it's expensive.  The breakfast is excellent, and will probably hold you till dinner.  The concierges were all great--we worked with David who was one of the friendliest and most helpful concierges we've ever met.

On a related note, we took a fly-drive package so we could tour the countryside after visiting Dublin.  If you are considering this, I would recommend getting a ground transfer from the airport to the hotel and then having your rental car delivered to the hotel when you're ready to leave.  We ended up paying for a car that we had to keep in the Westin's garage for a couple of days, and the daily rate for the car and parking was expensive.

Have a great time in Ireland!  It's a wonderful place.

202,Good location but messive housekeeping,"Just stayed there for a long weekend in late August 2004.  Very good location, easy access to Temple Bar & other interest points in the city.  Rooms are ok, but not as good as expected, I would say - just average hotel's room.

Service from Front desk and Concierge were good, but the housekeeping was a mess.  Our room was on the 5th floor which is the roof top, the room was bright and view was good-overlooked the city.  But we found the room was dusty and my wife bang her head many times due to a 45 degree roof angle.  The bed was comparative small though it is a so called queen size bed.  We moved to a room on 2nd level the next day.  Similar snags were found, bed side tables and other amenities in the room were dusty.  We never have such experience with other 5* hotels we had been stayed.  We stayed there for 4 days 3 nights, no refill of bathroom amenities and milk/cream for coffee (coffee/tea facility is complimentary).  Cups' size were not unique, one big and one small, look like the hotel was run out of cups.  Tea spoons & mugs were not cleaned or replaced after we used it, just left it there as long as our stay.  Obviously the house keepers didn't cleaned the room properly, except replaced the towels and fold back the bed linen daily.   We have suggested the hotel management to re-train the house keepers if necessary.

Express check-out is fabulous, just press few buttons on the TV remote control during we were packing, then pick up the receipt from the front dest when we leave.  Easy and smooth.",3,2004,09,09
202,Fantastic,"We stayed at The Westin in May 2004 and had a fantastic time.  The hotel was lovely, the staff were great and the beds were fantastic.  I can fully recommend the room service for breakfast, it was the best I've ever had!

202,A fireplace to warm up your soul,"Stayed there in November 2003 and the warmth of the fireplaces in the lobby was a panacea from the winter chill outside.
Beautiful room and a superb bathroom, with separate tub and shower; upscale toiletries and remarkable white granite tiles.
Internet and tv on demand and, of course, a minibar.
It is in the very center, right across Temple Bar (where all the pubs are) and the Trinity College.
None of the bars is really expensive (‚Ç¨ 6/7 for an alcoholic drink).
Breakfast, uhm.. just good.
Have a nice stay there!

202,Good Hotel but not as good as other reviews suggest,"Very well located right on major shopping street. Easy walking to temple bar district, too. Comparing reality with the photos on starwood.com the hotel did not visually meet our expectations (however, the atrium, up the stairs, is really nice), especially the advertised sumptous room decor is a marketing joke. The rooms are good, but not sumptous. Service was acceptable but not impressive.  Overall, expensive hotel in a generally overpriced city.

202,What a great hotel!,"We went to Dublin for a long weekend and stayed at the Westin.  We booked a deluxe room w/king-size bed.  The room was huge!  I paced it off at over 450 sq. ft. - of which 100 was bathroom.  Not much view, but 4th floor so lots of sunlight (hotel is five storeys).
The hotel must have great management because the staff continually exceeded expectations.  The perfect balance between privacy and service.  Darragh, the concierge, was immensely helpful.  The quality of the rooms was unbeatable.  I've traveled extensively, and this was honestly one of the best hotel experiences I can recall.

202,Worth the Trip,"Fabulous hotel in the center of it all in Dubllin.  Very quiet yet across the street from the Temple Bar full of nightspots.  Short 5 minute walk to shopping.

This hotel overlooks Trinity College and is in a central location, yet is not in the middle of Temple Bar and all of the riffraff (i.e., falling-down drunk tourists) that one encounters in Temple Bar. Service is professional; the concierge staff is engaging and extremely helpful; the front desk staff is top notch; room service could not be more accommodating. Rooms are beautiful. The two suites that I have occupied were spacious, very nicely appointed and extremely comfortable; great bathrooms.

202,Excellent five-star property,"I just spent one night at the Westin Dublin and found it to be everything described by other people at tripadvisor.com. I stayed in deluxe room which was very nice. The size was just right, not small as is the case with most European hotels but not so big there is wasted space. The decorations were very nice, just like the picture of the room on the Westin site (www.spg.com). The hotel is relatively new and that shows in the carpeting and furniture. The bed is extremely comfortable and the bathroom very large. My only complaint is no hairdryer!!

It is absolutely worth a stay here.",5,2003,11,28

202,Best part of Ireland,"The best part about Ireland was our trip to Dublin and our stay at the Westin Dublin. The staff couldn't of been more gracious and accomodating and it certainly was welcome sigh of relief to finally have waterpressure.

After travelling the countryside and experiencing overpriced tiny B @ B's and being gouged at smokey pubs for less than average meals I have one thing to say ""you get what you pay for"". Convienently located to all the wonderful restaurants and shopping of Grafton Street and strategically positioned across the street from Trinity College (the book of Kells is a must) the Westin Dublin revitalized my spirits and completed our trip on a high note. I highly recommend it.",5,2003,07,26
202,"Westin Hotel, Dublin, First Rate Experience","Our recent visit to Ireland was highlighted by our stay at the Westin Hotel, Dublin. The service is what we have become accustomed to in a first class hotel: efficient, prompt and courteous. The rooms were well appointed and the heavenly bed was as advertised, a pleasure on which to sleep. The hotel staff was most polite, and the restaurants served wonderfully delicious dinners. As nice as the amenities were, the location was even better. Trinity College is virtually next door, Grafton Street and Temple Bar a two minute walk. It was a pleasure staying at the Westin, and I would highly recommend this hotel.",5,2003,07,07
202,An impressive package,"There are some lovely things about this hotel.  It is amazingly central, opposite Trinity College and Temple Bar, and 1 minute from Grafton Street shopping, yet is very quiet.  It only opened in 2001, and the furnishings and decoration are of the highest quality.  The bar is a proper bar, cheap and used heavily by locals and with live music on Saturdays.  There are two good restaurants, but you can also buy very cheap high quality snacks in the Bar and the beautiful glassed Atrium. If I have any criticism, it is that my room was a little small, especially for a junior suite.  The quality of the furnishings did compensate, however.  It was also a shame that there was no CD player and that the TV sound did not play through to the bathroom.  Apart from that, though, this is a great place to stay. You may want to call direct and ask for the best rates.  I know that the hotel was offering Euro 230 / night at reception, but the best rate on the website was Euro 246. However, I would trade up to a junior suite if you can - I paid Euro 337 which is not that much more. PS.  Handy hint - the windows do open, but you have to ask reception to do it for you.  You have to sign a disclaimer first!  They will also supply an extra light in your room if you want them, as I did.",5,2003,03,25

The hotel itself seems super elegant to me and has an interesting history. The location is good, right in the center of Dublin. The room was tidy and impeccable, the beds super comfortable and large. The bathroom was also spacious with a shower and tub. The view from the room was very nice.

Es wird sich bem√ºht auf jeden vom Gast ge√§u√üerten Wunsch einzugehen, sodass der Aufenthalt angenehm und erholsam wird. Sollte ein Problem auftreten- wird dieses sofort angegangen und eine L√∂sung gefunden.
Hier m√∂chten wir uns besonders bei Rhea und Jack bedanken, die sich mit freundlicher Ruhe und enormem Engagement darum gek√ºmmert haben ein passendes Zimmer f√ºr uns zu finden.
Insgesamt haben wir nur positive Erfahrungen mit dem Personal in diesem Haus gemacht. Es gibt dem Gast das Gef√ºhl ernstgenommen zu werden.

La atenci√≥n desde el momento en que llegas a la puerta es exquisito, la atenci√≥n es muy destacable.
El servicio de recepci√≥n es r√°pido y servicial, nada que reprochar.
Las habitaci√≥n son perfectas, amplias, ordenadas, bien decoradas, silenciosas y con una climatizaci√≥n muy lograda.
Los ba√±os son completos, con ducha y ba√±era, los complementos quiz√° podr√≠an ser un poco m√°s amplios, solo hay un bote de champ√∫, uno de jab√≥n y un acondicionador. Quiz√° ser√≠a recomendable ampliar el n√∫mero y la variedad. 
La dotaci√≥n de toallas y albornoces es suficiente, faltar√≠an unas zapatillas.

202,"Kleines, dunkles, lautes Zimmer f√ºr 350 Euro am Tag, unkompetenter Service","Das Preis-Leistungs-Verh√§ltnis im Westin Dublin stimmt √ºberhaupt nicht. Ich hatte ein kleines, lautes und dunkles Zimmer mit 2 Fenstern, die auf H√ºfthohe endeten. Auch bei Sonnenschein muss man Licht anschalten, um das Zimmer bewohnbar zu machen. Das Bad ist altmodisch, m√§√üig sauber und hat eine extrem niedrige Decke. Der Service war nicht sehr aufmerksam und die Rezeption gab mir und anderen G√§sten seltsame Ratschl√§ge (""am Sonntagmorgen dauert die Taxifahrt zum Flughafen 90 Minuten"", tats√§chlich waren es keine 30 Minuten). 

Da ich selbst pro Jahr ca. 60-80 Hoteln√§chte in 4 und 5-Sterne H√§usern verbringe, kann ich deutlich sagen, das war das schlechteste Preis-Leistungsverh√§ltnis in den letzten 12 Monaten. Ich werde sicher nicht wiederkommen.",1,2016,05,19

Das Bad war f√ºr kleine Menschen gemacht. Ich bin wirklich nicht riesig, konnte aber nicht einmal aufrecht unter der Dusche stehen. Die Deckenh√∂he in der Dusche ziemlich genau zwei Meter, entsprechend deutlich niedriger der Duschkopf.

Das Fr√ºhst√ºck ist qualitativ sehr hochwertig. Nespresso-Maschine sorgt f√ºr guten Kaffee, Orangensaft ist frisch gepresst. Die K√ºche hilft bei di√§tischen Anforderungen. Etwas irritierend ist die umfangreiche Liste an Kosten f√ºr Zusatzbestellungen (z.B. diverse Eierspeisen), nie wirklich klar, bei welchem Fr√ºhst√ºckspaket was enthalten ist oder eben nicht.

Ottima come al solito l'organizzazione Expedia. Ottimo l'hotel Westin Dublin posizionato in zona centrale strategica a pochi passi da Temple Bar e da Trinity College. Molto bella e vivace la citt√†. Impegnativo per la distanza il viaggio organizzato da Daytours (non troppo bene, praticamente pranzo saltato causa poco tempo e molta coda) alle scogliere di Moher ma ne vale la pena. Impegnativo e male organizzato il viaggio a Kilkenny anche perch√© effettuato il giorno di pasquetta con notevole traffico. Aeromobili della Aer Lingus scomodi anche per taglie medie. Ritardi di oltre un'ora sia in partenza da Linate che al ritorno da Dublino. 
Nel complesso un piacevole soggiorno.",4,2015,04,24
202,Dublino ai tuoi piedi,"L'Hotel √® uno dei migliori di Dublino, situato in una posizione perfetta per scoprire la citt√†.Insieme a mia moglie per 4/5 gg. abbiamo potuto visitare, complice anche il costante bel tempo trovato, tutte le zone pi√π interessanti del centro e della periferia.Il personale √® giovane e molto professionale. All'arrivo siamo stati accolti con molta cortesia e simpatia che non sono mai mancate neanche nei giorni successivi; sempre pronti ad esaudire ogni tuo desiderio o almeno a fare il possibile in tal senso. La camera era la n. 218, deluxe con vista nell'atrio centrale, molto accogliente, spaziosa, con un bagno molto grande e comodo, un letto King e munita di tutti i confort. La pulizia √® giornaliera ed all'altezza del luogo.
L'unico piccolo fastidio, ma questa √® una pratica tuttavia consueta nelle strutture di lusso, √® il blocco sulla carta di credito di 50 E. a notte per eventuali spese e necessit√† durante il soggiorno che vengono calcolate al ceckh-out, ma che ovviamente non vengono prelevate se non si sono effettuate spese ulteriori. Altre piccola pecca forse √® la mancanza del wi-fi gratuito nelle stanze, il quale √® tuttavia free nelle sale comuni e funziona regolarmente.
l'Hotel √® a un minuto a piedi da Temple Bar dove poter andare a mangiare nei numerosi pubs e nei quali poter sentire ottima musica tradizionale e non. Locali che possiamo consigliare Porthouse ed il Boxty (quest'ultimo un p√≤ pi√π caro ma ne vale la pena).
Appena atterrati abbiamo acquistato direttamente in aeroporto la Leap Card (19,50) la quale ci ha permesso non solo di giungere direttamente vicinissimi all'hotel prendendo il 747 che gi√† da solo costa 6 E. ma anche di usufruire dei Bus, del treno Dart con il quale abbiamo visitato le cittadine di mare Howth e Bray, e del linea Luas, per tre giorni (72h) senza pagare altro. Al ritorno abbiamo preferito prendere un taxi per goderci ancora un p√≤ l'atmosfera di Dublino durante la mattinata, il quale alla modica cifra fissa di 22 E. ci ha condotto in 20/25 min. in aeroporto. 
Certo non √® un albergo economico, ma il rapporto con la qualit√† del servizio √® giusto.
Non potevamo scegliere di meglio.",5,2015,04,22
202,Sehr sch√∂n,"Wir vergn√ºgten uns wirklich hervorragend in diesem kurzen Wochenendeurlaub. Die Lage des Hotels kann gar nicht hoch genug bewertet werden. Das Fr√ºhst√ºcksbuffet war okay, das Personal hilfsbereit, die Betten waren himmlisch wie in allen Westins. Die Lage ist einfach super, mit dem Trinity College 3 Minuten entfernt und der O'Connell Street 5 Minuten in die andere Richtung. Das Hotel hat eine wunderbare Lage,sehr zentral.

202,ottima sistemazione,"confermo quanto scritto nelle recensioni precedenti, albergo davvero bello e confortevole, in una posizione perfetta. Personale attento e professionale, colazione gustosa e molto varia. Abbiamo provato sia l'Atrium per il tea nel pomeriggio, sia il Mint bar la sera, in entrambi abbiamo gustato degli ottimi cibi a prezzi accettabili.Lo consiglio senza alcuna riserva.
Unica critica, se proprio la si vuole trovare, √® il mancato riassetto della camera la sera.",5,2015,04,06
202,La colazione √® da Re,"Premesso che parliiamo di un luogo top, con consti conseguenti, l'unica cosa che manca √® uno spazio sportivo adeguato, nel resto rasenta la perfezione.
Situato nel centro pi√π centro che c'√®, un Hotel che merita le 5 stelle che non espone.
Nella hall due camini vi consentono di leggere in pace in un ambiente decisamente confortevole
Le camere sono ampie, spaziose, ben accessoriate ed illuminate
Ottimo il bagno, pur senza il bidet riservato solo alle culture ed ai popoli superiori, armadio diviso in pi√π parti, sempre illuminato e ben accessoriato, letto comodo. Molte coperte, troppi cuscini, camera silenziosa, vista inesistente.
La struttrura ha una corte ampia coperta all'altezza del tetto, dove si trova uno dei ristoranti, ed ha un altro ristorante interno estremamente raffinato. 
Colazione da Re, ad un prezzo tra l'altro estremamente contenuto.
Impossibile raccontare la variet√† e qualit√† delle materie prime, che spaziano dai formaggi alle uova strapazzate, alle marmellate, pani di vari tipi, latte yogurt caff√® e capuccino, certo con le cialde ma decisamente bevibile, salumi cotti e crudi succhi e spremute di tutto ci√≤ che volete, e frutta di ogni tipo, tutti prodotti di qualit√† molto elevata. 
Se volete girare per Dublino potete tranquillamente tirare sera con la sola colazione, la migliore che abbiamo mai trovato nei pur numerosi hotel frequentati.
Unico neo, le tessere delle camere, che servono anche per l'ascensore, si smagnetizzano troppo facilmente, in 24 ore ce le hanno dovute cambiare 2 volte.
Sicuramente un posto in cui andare, e dove non potrete fare a meno di tornare.",5,2015,02,09
202,Lussuoso e centrale,"L'hotel si raggiunge comodamente con l'autobus che arriva dall'aeroporto, la fermata per il ritorno √® proprio dall'altro lato della strada.
E' in posizione centrale e quasi tutte le attrazioni si raggiungono a piedi. Temple Bar √® vicinissimo, a pochi minuti.
Check-in veloce, come anche il check-out.
La hall √® molto bella, i due caminetti la rendono accogliente e calda. Alla sinistra del banco della reception vengono offerte delle bevande e della frutta secca.
Tutto il personale √® gentile, sorridente e professionale. In caso di pioggia, se sprovvisti, √® possibile trovare un ombrello alla conciergerie.
La mia camera, una deluxe, era molto spaziosa e pulita, silenziosa, il letto era molto buono, un po' meno i cuscini, la biancheria di ottima qualit√†. C'era anche la radio sveglia, il ferro e l'asse da stiro.
Scomodo per√≤ l'armadio che, al suo interno, aveva un mobile con cassetti abbastanza alto e largo che limitava lo spazio per appendere altro oltre ai cappotti. Non c'√® attaccapanni in camera.
Il bagno era pulito e funzionale, dotato di vasca e di una bella doccia, a parte. Buoni i prodotti del set cortesia, √® fornito l'accappatoio.
Bella la sala dell'Exchange Restaurant in cui √® servita la colazione, con ampie finestre che danno sulla via principale. L'atmosfera √® calda e il personale √® accogliente e gentile. I tavoli sono ampi.
Buoni i prodotti della colazione che comprende sia il dolce che il salato, frutta fresca e succhi di frutta molto buoni. E' possibile prepararsi anche un caff√® all'italiana.
Abbiamo cenato al Mint Bar. I prezzi sono abbordabili considerando lo standard qualitativo dell'hotel. Buono il piatto a base di pesce e la cheese-cake.
Nel complesso l'hotel mi √® piaciuto e lo consiglio per la posizione centrale, la pulizia, buona anche nei luoghi comuni, la buona colazione.
La connessione dell'wi-fi, gratuito solo nei luoghi comuni, √® difficoltosa.",4,2015,01,03
202,Elegante e centrale!,"Hotel particolarmente elegante con tutti i confort delle stelle che offre, unica pecca wifi a pagamento eccetto nei luoghi comuni. Camere molto belle, spaziose e pulite. Il personale √® molto cortese e sempre disponibile. Valore aggiunto di questo hotel √® la sua centralissima collocazione, puoi raggiungere con pochi passi ogni angolo pi√π caratteristico della citt√†!
Gradevole l'Atrium, spazio riservato al tea time con un superbo assortimento di dolci e salati.
Lo consiglio caldamente! ",5,2014,12,08
202,Unser Hotel in unserer Stadt,"Ein Hotel wie wir es erwarten von einem Westin.
Perfektes Personal, immer bem√ºht dem Gast das Gef√ºhl zu geben, er sei einzig artig.
Die Lage ist sehr gut, alles was man in der City von Dublin sehen will ist problemlos erreichbar.
Das Einzige was wir das n√§chste Mal √§ndern w√ºrden, ein n√§chstes Mal gibt es bestimmt, wir w√ºrden uns f√ºr ein Zimmer Richtung Atrium entscheiden, Strassenseitig ist es trotz Isolierfenstern am Morgen doch recht laut.
Die Bar fanden wir etwas k√ºhl, gross und mit vielen Leuten laut, da in einem Gew√∂lbe",5,2014,11,04
202,C√©ntrico y tranquilo,Situado cerca de Trinity College y a escasos minutos de la zona peatonal y de la comercial al otro lado del r√≠o. Servicio atento y eficaz. Entorno tranquilo y poco ruidoso.. Una buena experiencia tal como ha sucedido en otros hoteles Westin.,4,2014,09,27
202,auch Fr√ºhst√ºck und Afternoon Tea unbedingt geniessen.,"Das Hotel hat unsere Erwartungen voll erf√ºllt. Speziell ber√ºcksichtigen sollte man unbedingt das Fr√ºhst√ºck und zwar das Irische, d.h. Irish Breakfast mit dem tollen Angebot und auch der Crepe-Maschine sowie etwas, welches vom Hotel verschwiegen wird: Im verglasten Innenhof gibt es jeweils einen sehr ausgiebigen, ausgezeichneten Afternoon Tea. Man muss daf√ºr unbedingt einen Tisch reservieren. Es sind dort meist Damengesellschaften versammelt (wie z.B. B√ºro-/Club-Teams, Tanten/M√ºtter usw. mit T√∂chtern, Nichten etc.), aber es lohnt sich auf jeden Fall. 

Auch die Ausk√ºnfte punkto Veranstaltungen, Restaurant usw. waren sehr hilfreich. 
Die Lage usw. ist sowieso auf jeden Fall OK. 

Einziger kleiner Minuspunkt war, soweit ich mich erinnern kann, eine fehlende Aufh√§ngevorrichtung f√ºr z.B. nasse Regenm√§ntel.",5,2014,09,19
202,Hotel muy c√≥modo y c√©ntrico.,"Me aloj√© en una suite juniors por 3 noches. La habitaci√≥n es muy c√≥moda. El desayuno es muy bueno. Su ubicaci√≥n es excelente, a pasos de las principales atracciones.
Solo tuve un problema en el ingreso en donde a pesar de tener un early check in (sujeto a disponibilidad), a la hora indicada de tomar la habitaci√≥n (15 hs), la habitaci√≥n o estaba disponible y tuve que esperar media hora m√°s. Hicieron todo lo posible para contenerme, pero es un detalle impotante que debo resaltar ya que no deber√≠a ocurrir.
De todos modos recomendar√≠a este hotel.",4,2014,08,18
202,Veramente ottimo,"Veramente un bellissimo Hotel, fornito di tutto, e con grande attenzione ai particolari... Vicino al Trinity college e alle zone pedonali della citt√† ma abbastanza appartato da consentire una certa tranquillit√† una volta tornati in stanza, la colazione al mattino era veramente copiosa, piena di ogni ben di Dio... E anche se non si va a Dublino per guardare la Tv, √® piacevole poter scegliere tra Rai 1, 2, e 3 .... Veramente un week end rilassante!",5,2014,07,03
202,Historisches Hotel direkt am Trinity College,"Wir waren im Oktober f√ºr 2 N√§chte im Hotel The Westin Dublin.

Das Hotel liegt direkt neben dem Trinity College. Gegen√ºber liegt die Fleet Street, wo ein guter Pub mit gutem Essen neben dem anderen zu finden ist.

Das Hotel befindet sich in mehrere historischen Geb√§uden, die miteinander verbunden sind.

Der Empfang war sehr hilfsbereit und zuvorkommend und hat uns sofort einen late check-out f√ºr 15:00 angeboten. 

Die Zimmer sind mittlerweile alle modernisiert und haben eine moderne, ansprechende Einrichtung. Die Betten sind super bequem. Die B√§der sind mir Marmor ausgestattet. Obwohl die B√§der anscheinend nicht renoviert wurden, sind diese noch in einem tadellosen Zustand.

Das Fr√ºhst√ºcksbuffet ist f√ºr irische Verh√§ltnisse sehr gut.

Ich kann jedem nur das Hotel in Dublin empfehlen.",5,2014,06,24
202,"Gute Lage, schoene Zimmer, netter Service","Ich war hier fuer 4 Naechte. Fusslaeufig zum Buero, der Fussgaengerzone und vielen Attraktionen. Personal war sehr freundlich. Nette Bar im Hotel. Die Preise fuer Wifi im Zimmer sind eine Unverschaemtheit wenn man die Zimmerpreise bedenkt. Allerdings geht es in der Lobby umsonst. Gut gefallen hat mir die Aktion von new balance, Sportschuhe und auf Wunsch auch Trainingsklamotten gegen eine sehr geringe Gebuehr auszuleihen. Keine Ausrede, auch auf der Geschaeftsreise nicht ein wenig aktiv zu werden.",4,2014,05,27
202,"Gutes Hotel, tolle Lage, nicht modern","Das Westin hat in Dublin die perfekte Lage. Es ist alles in Walking Distance. Das Hotel ist sch√∂n eingerichtet bzw. gem√§ss dem Sterne- und Preisstandard. Das Personal ist sehr freundlich, jedoch ein bisschen unbeholfen. Die 4 Sterne kriegt das Westin von mir nicht, da man als Gast stark das Gef√ºhl kriegt, das Hotel wolle √ºberall Zusatzverk√§ufe machen: WLAN im Zimmer kostet Euro 15 pro 24 Stunden (!), das ist heutzutage eine Frechheit und nicht gerechtfertigt. Es gibt nur gratis WLAN in der Lobby, welches auch noch langsam ist. Als Weltneuheit wurde uns Late Checkout angepriesen, selbstverst√§ndlich f√ºr einen Aufpreis.",3,2014,02,11
202,Wunderbar,"Am Westin Dublin ist wirklich alles gut. Sehr freundliches Personal. Sch√∂ne, sauberer Zimmer, gutes Fr√ºhst√ºck und sehr bequeme Betten. Dazu kommt noch die ideale Lage mitten in der Stadt. Klar, dass so ein Hotel seinen Preis hat. Budget-Reisende sind hier an der falschen Adresse.

Einziger Kritikpunkt aus meiner sich die Zimmer zum - √ºbrigens sehr sch√∂nen - Atrium, in denen sich die Fenster nicht √∂ffnen lassen. Wer das nicht mag, sollte eine h√∂here Zimmerkategorie buchen. Dort kann man die Fenster √∂ffnen. 

Wer eine Reise nach Dublin plant und √ºber eine ausreichende Reisekasse verf√ºgt, sollte im Westin absteigen. Besser geht es nicht.",5,2014,01,01
202,Ubicaci√≥n muy buena,"En mi ultimo viaje a Irlanda me he quedado en este hotel. Tiene una ubicaci√≥n muy buena, el servicio bien, la habitaci√≥n un poco rancia en cuanto a decoraci√≥n, demasiado inglesa. El precio un poco caro para la lo que ofrece.",3,2013,12,28
202,"Excelente situaci√≥n, aunque una 5¬™ planta ruidosa","Situado en pleno centro de Dublin, excelente como centro de operaciones para visitar la ciudad. Tiene instalaciones sobresalientes y las habitaciones son espaciosas y limpias. La calidad del sue√±o tambi√©n es buena, pero los que tuvimos la desgracia de ser hospedados en habitaciones de la 5¬™ planta (fuimos un grupo de amigos) coincidimos en lo ruidoso de las mismas. Siempre hab√≠a alg√∫n sonido de fondo (posiblemente las m√°quinas de A/A en lo alto del edificio). La cuesti√≥n es que si tienes un sue√±o ligero el ruido se convierte en una verdadera molestia).
Otro punto que a mi personalmente no me gusta es que las habitaciones est√°n enmoquetadas, aunque s√© que es una costumbre muy extendida en Europa, me resulta poco higi√©nico.
Respecto al trato de los empleados, en todo momento fueron muy atentos, a pesa de nuestra torpeza con el ingl√©s.",4,2013,11,10

Ottima la pulizia in camera, nelle parti comuni e nella palestra. Gentile e disponibile il personale, soprattutto quello alla reception. Bella la hall e l'atrio centrale con il tetto di vetro, dove affacciava la nostra camera al secondo piano. Ottimo anche per la vicinanza alla fermata della linea Aircoach (Bus 747 che collega l'aeroporto con il centro citt√†) e per la convenzione che hanno con il servizio taxi (‚Ç¨ 22,00 dall'hotel all'aeroporto pagati direttamente in hotel).

Leider wurde das Zimmer erst um 16.00 Uhr gereinigt - das arme Personal scheint ""understaffed"" zu sein. Gep√§ck wurde auch nicht auf unser Zimmer getragen.

202,hotel imperfetto,"Posizionato proprio alle spalle di Trinity College e apochi passi da Temple Bar, premesse importanti. Il tentativo di arrivare alla perfezione c'√®, con ambiente ricercato senza eccedere. L'imperfezione sta tutta nel personale, secondo me mal gestito o forse giovane. Le disavventure sono state troppe per essere una coincidenza, Premesso che viaggiavo per lavoro e tutto, come solito, mi viene prepagato dalla sede, mi sono visto decurtare dalla mia carta di credito una cifra pari all'intero costo del soggiorno, con la promessa di cancellare l'addebito a fine soggiorno. E nel frattempo quella cifra risulta indisponibile sulla carta di credito. Ma siamo impazziti? La sera dell'arrivo, quindi, nulla da fare, la ragazza della reception √® irremovibile. Il giorno dopo protestone dal direttore con tanto di sue scuse per l'accaduto.
Poi nella stanza Frigobar con porta bloccata, essendo sera tardi e gi√† incavolato per l'episodio della carta di credito decido di dormire nella camera molto ben tenuta.
All'indomani, tornando in stanza dopo la giornata di lavoro trovo un altro frigobar fuori dal mobile, ma sorpresa:vuoto. E in giro, sebbene tutto in ordine, un aria di LAVORI IN CORSO. Alle mie proteste per la poca gentilezza di lasciare una camera con un frigobar, vuoto e per giunta rumoroso (posto fuori dal suo mobiletto), mi √® stato risposto che avrei potuto togliere la spina.

202,"Super Lage, sch√∂nes klassisches Geb√§ude und angenehme Einrichtung","Lage: 
Das Hotel ist mitten in der Innenstadt, zentral gelegen. Zwischen dem ""Zahnstocher"" (Sichtweite) zur Graf Street (4 Minuten zu Fuss). Taxistand direkt vor dem Eingang und diverse Bushaltestellen in der N√§he. Tesco ist direkt in einer Nebenstrasse, Subway gegen√ºber und diverse Restaurant zwischen Table Bar und der Graf Street laden zum denieren ein.
Die DART (U/S-Bahn) Stationen sind in ca. 5 Minuten erreicht.

Hotel: 
Das Hotel, so wie ich h√∂rte, ein ehemalige Bankfilale, ist sehr gem√ºtlich eingerichtet. Ich f√ºhlte mich beim betreten der Lobby sofort heimisch in Irland. Im Empfangraum flackerte ein offener Kamin. Die ""Schalter"" sind so gestaltet, dass die Mitarbeiter jederzeit sich neben einen Stellen k√∂nnen um einen die Fragen bspw. auf der Karte direkt einzu malen.

Es gibt eine Bar, ein Restaurant und ein ""Tagesrestaurant"". Der Zimmerservice verf√ºgt √ºber die Sheraton Gruppe √ºblichen Gerichte und Preise. H√∂chste Gaumenerwartungen werden sich nicht befriedet, daf√ºr jedoch ein guter Hunger mit solider Nahrung.

Es gibt einen angenehm eingerichteten Fitnessraum, in dem man sich durchaus etwas bewegen kann. Neben 4 Cardio Ger√§ten, gibt es noch eine Freihantelbank mit einer guten Auswahl an Hanteln (leider keine Langhantel ;)). 

Die Zimmer sind durch die G√§nge sehr verwinkelt gelegen. Ich hatte immer das Gef√ºhl mich zu verlaufen, fand dennoch stets mein Zimmer.

Mein Zimmer war sehr ger√§umig, weit gr√∂√üer als ich bisher aus Dublin und London gewohnt bin. Verf√ºgte √ºber alle klassischen Standards: WiFi, LAN (selbe Rate mit mehreren Ger√§ten betreibar, bspw. iPhone und Laptop), Telefone, MiniBar, Dusche und seperate Wanne, LED TV mit zum Teil dt. Fernsehen, Teekocher + Kaffeemaschine (complimentary).

Das Bett fand ich super. Ich konnte hervorragend in meinem Queensized Bett schlafen. zu Zweit w√§re es mir jedoch zu Klein und w√ºrde ein King Size Bett oder zwei Twin Betten anfragen. Kissen gab es F√ºnf.

Das Hotel hat eine wunderbare Lage,sehr zentral. Die Zimmer und das Fr√ºhst√ºck waren in Ordnung. Das Angebot erhielten wir von HRS im Internet.",4,2010,10,28
202,Super Lage!,"Das Westin in Dublin ist super gelegen, man kann alles wunderbar zu Fuss machen, Temple Bar  und Trinity College sind nur zwei Minuten entfernt. Unser Zimmer war etwas dunkel, aber sehr gem√ºtlich. Das Personal ist au√üerordentlich freundlich, und auch der hauseigene Pub ist empfehlenswert, wenn man schnell etwas essen m√∂chte. Wir waren rundum zufrieden und k√∂nnen das Westin nur empfehlen!",5,2010,09,06
202,Perfektes Wochenend-Hotel,"Aus meiner Sicht ein sehr gutes 4-Sterne Hotel, und bestimmt eines der besten in Dublin.
Einfach vom Flughafen mit dem √∂ffentlichen Bus zu errreichen....von der Haltestelle 2 Min zu Fuss. Die Lage des Hotels ist sehr zentral und das meiste zu Fuss zu erreichen. Das Hotel ist elegant ( aber nicht zu √ºbertrieben), das Personal freundlich. Unser Zimmer war ein ""upgrade"" ( als SPG Platinum Member ) zu einer ansprechenden Suite ( jeweils nach einem mehr oder weniger bekannten irischen Schriftsteller benannt..nette Idee )  Zimmerservice war schell, das Club-Sandwich gut. . Das Fr√ºhst√ºck vorallem irisch / englisch ( w√ºrstl, speck, bohnen )..nicht mein Geschmack, aber trotzdem reicht der Rest f√ºr einen guten Start in den Tag. Insgesamt ein gutes Hotel mit einigermassen stimmigem Preis-Leistungverh√§ltnis. F√ºr ein paar Tage absolut zu empfehlen..Privat genauso wie gesch√§ftlich.",4,2010,08,06
202,Indimenticabile.,"Superiore alle aspettative. Ho prenotato attraverso il loro sito una superior a prezzo scontatissimo, vista sull'amato  Trinity (per me la sola cosa che contasse!!). Ho ottenenuto una camera deliziosa, spaziosa,  arredata, come tutto al Westin, con  classe e con gran  cura.  Atmosfera  cordiale e rilassante. Idem il personale. Unica pecca: nessuno parlava l'italiano: per un hotel a 5 stelle e di tale calibro  l'ho trovato un p√≤ demod√®. Struttura consigliatissima perch√® stupenda nel suo complesso, centralissima e funzionale ai mezzi pubblici. Torner√≤  sicuramente. Anche per  constatare di persona se hanno assunto un interprete italiano....",5,2010,07,29
202,"Ausgezeichnete Lage, super Service","Das Westin Dublin liegt sehr Zentral in der N√§he des College Green, dem Trinity College mit der ber√ºhmten Bibliothek und dem Spire of Dublin. Das Hotel wirkt vornehm aber trotzdem gem√ºtlich mit einem sehr sch√∂nen gedeckten Innenhof wo man Nachmittags Kaffee und Kuchen bekommt. Gegessen haben wir im Hotel nicht, denn das Stadtzentrum hat kulinarisch mehr zu bieten als man von Irland generell erwarten w√ºrde. Das Ausgehviertel Temple Bar beginnt wenige hundert Meter vom Hoteleingang und auch sonst s√§umen diverse Restaurants die Gassen der irischen Hauptstadt. Die Zimmer de Hotels sind sehr sch√∂n gestaltet und das typische Westin Bett sehr bequem. Das Personal war jederzeit freundlich und hilfreich. Insgesamt ist das Westin Dublin sowohl f√ºr Business als auch f√ºr die spontane St√§dtereise sehr empfholen.",5,2010,06,08
202,Me quede enamorada de dublin ..,"Bueno yo no trato bien con el idioma ingles pero encontre en la ciudad mucha gente que no habla ingles , en la recepci√≥n esta sebastian y una chica espa√±ola , pero si pueden manejense con sebastian , existen ciertos tours pero hay que tener dias sino al salir lleguen hasta el espiral gris que es la parada de los buses rojos subansen por 15 euros mas  o menos y van bajando y subiendo son baratos yo lo he hecho en otras ciudades y son los mas baratos ahi , lugares para cenar cientros pregunten en el hall igual hay un restaurante hay un salon de tea por una escalera al hall la chicas son buena onda pidan el menu , el bar habia un chico bastante mala actitud pero yo no me mosqueo con esas cosas . Se pueden encontrar a bono ah√≠ , el suele ir a tomar alguna bebida yo lo encontr√© como plus sirve ,  siempre guiensen con el espiral gris a la izquierda a unas cuadras una excelente jugueteria en la esquina y recorran si pueden comprar alg√∫n boleto en 02 arena vayan. Yo vi a rod steward en el inicio del tour europeo as√≠ que excelente.
Cuidado porque siempre hay alguien atento al descuido de otros , la gente es muy amable muchos policias . pidan cuartos que den hac√≠a la calle principal si pueden no hacia el colegio ese para atr√°s yo era cliente vip y mucho el vidrio sucio no me gusto . pero no dije nada estaba en el 103 por cierto. El ba√±o excelente me encanto tiene un lugar para masajes alucinante si pueden haganlo.
Es uno de los pocos hoteles 5 estrellas , a contrario de lo que dice alg√∫n personaje que comento yo viajo diariamente dir√≠a cada d√≠a de mi vida.. y este hotel cumple con todo tipo de pedido.

lo unico que la hora de internet sale 6 euros deberian de brindarlo gratuito , seria el consejo porque a mi me gusta ese tipo de servicio en especial porque es caro ya de por si la estad√≠a. Y pidan abajo adaptadores tienen sino en el gabinete del mini bar completo aviso.",5,2010,06,01
202,sproporzione costo-servizio,"Abbiamo passato una settimana al Westin nell'agosto scorso. Sicuramente una bellissima struttura e centralissima. Le camere venivano rifatte solo verso le ore 18 di pomeriggio!!!! Il bagno schiuma insufficiente per 2 persone. La colazione non certamente da albergo cinque stelle. Rumori sino a tarda notte nei corridoi da un gruppo di tedeschi e cattivi odori. Unico conforto una dipendente italiana molto gentile alla reception che ha capito, ma solo questo, tutti gli inconvenienti. Pentiti della scelta.",3,2010,05,23
202,che freddo ma....,"Giornate freddissime a Dublino ma questo hotel centralissimo, curatoe raffinato come una bomboniera di classe ci ha consentito di rientrare spesso..",4,2009,02,02
202,Para darte un lujo!,"Nos alojamos en el Westin durante un fin de semana y lo elegimos por su ubicacion y porque queriamos algo especial. Este hotel es una maravilla desde que entras por la puerta, se respira tranquilidad, nos atendieron muy amablemente, como es de suponer en un 5*. El desayuno fantastico, tipo buffet  y de todo para elegir. La habitacion deba a una calle secundaria y era tranquilisima. Todo muy limpio y con muchisimos detalles. Si quieres algo especial y te puedes dar el lujo de vez en cuando te lo recomiendo.",5,2008,12,16
202,Perfekte Abrundung eines Urlaubs,"Dieses Westin ist seiner Philosophie wirklich treu. Der Service angefangen beim Check-In, Restaurant, Bar etc., sowie Housekeeping und Check-out waren wirklich professionell und √ºberaus herzlich. Wir haben jeder Zeit die richtigen Empfehlungen erhalten und viele Unannehmlichkeiten, wie Flugumbuchungen, Gep√§ckaufgabe wurden schnell und unkompliziert gel√∂st. 
Wir haben zweimal im Restaurant gegessen: netter Service, tolle und gut verarbeitete Produkte. Sonderw√ºnsche wurden stets beachtet!...allerdings auf Grund der N√§he zur Templebar und den anderen Sights und Restaurants nicht so gut besucht. Das Preis-Leistungsverh√§ltnis stimmt, man darf hier unbedingt einkehren. Das Highlight: die Bar: es gibt einen italienischen Barkeeper, der durch einen kurzen Smalltalk die tiefsten Cocktail- und Getr√§nke- W√ºnsche der G√§ste erkennt und erf√ºllt. Ohne aufdringlich zu sein besticht er durch seine offene, unaufdringliche Art. Meinem Mann servierte er den besten Cocktail seines Lebens (passte zur Stimmung und dem pers√∂nlichen Geschmack). Unbedingt testen! 
Ich finde, dieses Hotel ist eine Ruheoase in Dublin und dennoch ist es in der N√§he aller nennenswerten  Highlights von Dublin.
Wie in meiner √úberschrift erw√§hnt: diese Hotel war der perfekte Abschluss unseres Urlaubs!",5,2008,09,30
