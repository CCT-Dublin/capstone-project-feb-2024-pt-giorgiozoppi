248,Top class experience,"I stayed in the Camden court on the 19th of October. I was welcomed by David Hughes who was an absolute professional. David helped at every step of the checkin. Looking forward to staying in the Camden court again. 

Make sure this man get a raise.",5,2024,10,18
248,"Great Staff and Beautiful Building, but Some Cleanliness Issues","We stayed at Camden Court Hotel in Dublin as a family (parents and a 1.5-year-old), and while we enjoyed some aspects of our stay, there were a few issues that affected our overall experience.

The Good: The staff at the hotel were incredibly friendly and helpful, making us feel welcome from the moment we arrived. The building itself is beautiful, and the central location is convenient for exploring Dublin. We also appreciated the family-friendly atmosphere, and the room was spacious enough for the three of us.

The Downsides: Unfortunately, there were a few issues with cleanliness and convenience. The breakfast was the same every day, which became repetitive. During our stay, we also found hair in the bathroom, which was unpleasant. Additionally, the breakfast area wasn’t always properly cleaned between guests — we noticed dirty cutlery, milk jars, and food under the tables on multiple occasions.

The baby chair provided for our child was also a concern. The tray was easy to tilt, making it somewhat dangerous. Another inconvenience was that only one elevator in the main hall was working, which led to delays during busy times.

Overall, while the staff and the building were lovely, there are some areas where the hotel could improve, particularly with cleanliness and maintenance.

248,Lovely place to stay,"Spent one night here and was satisfied with the service, cleanliness, and atmosphere.  Not uncomfortably hoity-toity, but pretty nice.  Front desk was friendly and helpful.  The breakfast that was included was really good!  Not sure about the value because the price was included in our Gate 1 tour.",4,2024,10,08
248,Well situated ,If you don't mind a little walk this hotel is really well situated. It is also close to the tram line.  The rooms are comfortable though not overly large.  It has been refurbished since my stay here 12 years ago.  Great shower.   The staff are friendly and helpful.,4,2024,10,05
248,It was a great place to take stock,The room was spacious and well-organized with all kinds of amenities.  I made my first pot of tea with the supplies they leave in the rooms.   It's located downtown and there's a lot of shopping nearby.  The bathroom is luxurious and the beds were comfortable.  We ate in the lounge and the food was delicious.  A great place to stay.,5,2024,09,22
248,Good hotel but poor dining room hygiene practices,"I was really excited to revisit staying at this hotel after a 9 year absence.  I lived in the hotel for a year in 2014/15 during a project.   It was really striving to reach the 4 star status; and the staff really reflected that in the service they provided, particularly in the dining room.

The hotel and rooms have been renovated since and it's really nicely done.   No issues there.   The breakfast service and the hygiene around clearing tables have taken a nose dive.

I was at the hotel for 9 days in August 2024 and had breakfast everyday because it was included with the room.  Trying to get some coffee was usually a waiting game and many times, I had to go and ask someone.

My biggest issue was how the servers and supervisors of the servers at breakfast would allow so many tables to remain dirty for so long before clearing them; and then during the cleaning process would decide what utensils, dishes and paper napkins were clean enough to be used for the next person.   I am attaching a few pictures of what I'm referring to.   If you look at the before picture and the after picture, you'll see where sometimes everything except or a saucer, napkin and one utensil; or a single utensil was left for the next person to use.

Using the spray and clean cloth seemed to be an option rarely used and if it was, they would go around the remaining items on the table.

I did speak to the Duty Manager about this and asked for the email address of the F&B Manager, which I did send an email along with more than these pictures.   I got the standard, we are busy and try to do our best response.   I did email the Deputy General Manager and got another similar response.   No discounts were offered or asked for on my part.   I just wanted better training of the management and servers; these concerns were not addressed.

I did send a complaint regarding this to the Food Safety Authority of Ireland, who did get back to me stating they were referring this to the Inspector for Camden area of Dublin restaurants.   That gentleman did send an email to me stating that this was a serious concern and he would be arranging for a full inspection and review of the practices.    

I have not, as yet, heard back from him; but at least I feel confident that FSAI will make the impression on the F&B manager that things are not being done according to the standards a 4 star hotel dining area should be.

I still really like the hotel and perhaps one day might return, but I would encourage everyone who experiences similar situations, to not just accept the discount they seem to be willing to give to most people who bring this to their attention, knowing that the issue doesn't need to change, but to follow up and ensure that change does happen.

As I stated to the Management of the hotel, it seems that they have become reliant on the fact that the tour groups that come in for one or two nights and use the facility won't notice the practices and therefore change doesn't need to happen.   That shouldn't be the case, but sadly I feel they have accepted that training is too difficult for them, unless forced to do so.

Good hotel, nice rooms (even without AC) and great location....dining room, you may be putting your health at risk based on the hygiene practices.",3,2024,09,08
248,…..a few staff issues?’,"A nice hotel in a great location, but they seriously let us down on our stay. The desk/reception are great. The room was spacious BUT had no air con and it was pretty warm the weekend we were there. So, alot of money spent and fairly sleepless nights. There were a few glitches, but everything came back to lack of staff. Breakfast a case in point. We missed the first day and duly rolled up on Sunday. Again, very courteous on entry. Sat at table surrounded by uncleared tables from 2+ hours of service. No coffee or tea so went to reception to get some. No fruit juice, dirty trays, hot food intermittent etc etc. One poor young kid was trying his best to serve people, but he had no idea-I felt so sorry for him. After breakfast  sic,! I saw the Duty Manager and calmly explained what had happened. He was mortified, but was honest enough to admit they were short staffed. The next day he was serving in the restaurant himself…so, much respect. He also authorised a substantial refund. Because of these last two things I am happy to give a 3.
The hotel has in my mind done serious issues to address-I would like to think this may have already happened?",3,2024,08,31
248,Nice hotel near bars and restaurants,"A warning for Americans. This hotel does not provide washcloths so you need to bring your own. No, I’m not kidding. And if you are new to traveling in Europe, this is common at hotels.  For some reason this is a secret that no one but me talks about. Now for the review.

Check in was quick and luckily our room was ready early after our overnight flight from the USA. Don’t bother providing a credit card for charges unless it easier for your partner. Just use your credit card as you go. They will accept a card for room charges but it is not their normal practice at the front desk so it takes a while. Also, the bar and wait staff are not used to that so it takes longer. Just use your credit card.

WiFi was decent. I would suggest Americans use a VPN service like Hotspot so that you aren’t constantly nagged about privacy and blocked by the EU. The TV was big but I never turned it on so I can’t comment on the HiDef picture quality.

The Irish breakfast was good and the scrambled eggs weren’t runny! A first for me in Ireland. The fried eggs were also great on the brown bread. You will need to grab one of the wait staff for coffee or tea. Unless you can grab them they won’t bring it or come to the table except to clear plates.

The bar is relaxing but again if you want more drinks or the check you will need to get up and grab a waiter. 

Sleep quality in the room was good. There is no A/C but the nights were cool so with the window open and the provided oscillating fan the temps are good. The only danger is if you are the side near the street. It can get noisy from late night partiers. Luckily our window faced the courtyard to the hotel so noise was minimal.

We were assigned a handicap room. The good news was the toilet was high, The bad news the sink and mirror was very low which required me to squat down to see myself in the mirror and use the sink. The shower just has a curtain but there was a high nozzle and water didn’t splash around the bathroom from the lack of a lip in the floor.",4,2024,08,29
248,Very happy customers,"Really impressed overall with this hotel. Special mention to duty manager Chloe. She went above and beyond to make our recent stay so enjoyable. We arrived very eagerly 24 hours early by mistake, we were well looked after and it was no issue to the hotel and Chloe put us as ease. 
Service from all staff was so lovely. Room was stunning, immaculately clean and beautiful interior. Pool facilities were lovely, very hot, hot tub. 
Location excellent. 7 euro taxi to trinity. 
Food for breakfast and lunch so nice. 
Would recommend and would definitely return.",5,2024,08,14
248,Wish all hotels had coffee machines in the room!,"I really liked my stay here. It's a very nice hotel. Comfortable, modern rooms. Great shower. Loved the coffee machine in the room and the breakfast was lovely. Really nice stay for a recent business trip.  Will definitely be booking again with my family.",4,2024,08,14
248,Great location!,"This hotel is in a great location, steps from bus and streetcar lines, not to mention two of the loveliest parks in the city. The main downtown tourist area is just a 15 minute walk if you are so inclined. 

Great English breakfast if you are in to it. Big pool and nice exercise area. Mediocre ground floor lounge area. 

Comfortable room. Fabulous bathroom with non-fog mirror and ceiling rain shower!

Traveler hint: purchase a 72 hour Tourist LEAP card for 16 Euro. It gives unlimited access to TFI public transportation. Google maps is great for mapping your routes and bus timetables.",4,2024,08,14
248,"beautiful hotel, outstanding stay","Very comfortable stay.  Beds were great, room was spacious and clean, pool/spa was exceptional, and the staff were very helpful and kind.  This is a busy hotel, right in the heart of Camden area.  Very convenient to get around - right next the The Bleeding Horse bar!  I would highly recommend this hotel.  Just be sure to validate your parking pass at the front desk and save $20.  The man in charge of parking talks very fast and very Irish and I didn't understand the first time he told us to validate at front desk.  Made for a frustrating trip back inside after husband was stuck at the gate in garage.  But it all worked out. 2",5,2024,08,13
248,Family night away,"Great Hotel, very accommodating to all our needs. We stayed in a very large family room, it was very nice. We travelled as a family of 5 and had loads of space in the room. The lady who took our reservation was so helpful and made sure we had everything in the room we needed. A special mention to Chloe McGrath, who looked after us on the evening of our stay, even supplied some colouring books and pencils for our 3 children",5,2024,08,13
248,Great Hotel for a Family of 5,"We really enjoyed this hotel. It's hard to find hotel rooms in Europe for a family of five, and this worked well for us. Our room had two double beds and a chair that pulled out into a single. The room was clean, comfortable, and stylish. The location, not too far from St Stephens Green, was a good, safe jumping off spot for our family. The breakfast (included with our package) was really good every morning. We enjoyed this stay and would come again.",5,2024,08,08
248,Recommended hotel,"Really clean and well presented hotel, a bit of a walk into town, but nice if you go through the parks. The breakfast was excellent, lots of choices, the staff were very helpful and friendly. I would mention that they did seem harassed on occasion and the way that the deputy manager presented himself was not pleasant, which may explain why there was a bit of an atmosphere. On one occasion he and another suited individual took a member of staff into the middle of the restaurant to reprimand them (very bad management practice) and on a second occasion he stalked through the restaurant pointing out ‘errors’ that he at that moment could see, most of which were minor and one had just occurred. It’s worth him understanding that in the middle of a busy service that if a guest leaves a plate behind with bread and a knife on it and the team haven’t seen it straight away, they soon will, and pointing at it with an annoyed face is purely facile and unhelpful. His management style should be addressed as you will loose very good team members, it was evident his style was not working for some key people.",4,2024,08,08
248,Nice hotel but don't expect much sleep,"So the good bits....easy check in, very helpful staff, fabulous big room with dressing gown and slippers, beautiful pool area and the hottest hotel jacuzzi I've ever been in. I didn't have breakfast so can't comment on that but did have coffee and cake in the afternoon which was lovely.

The downside was no air conditioning in the bedroom, which meant keeping the windows open and as it's a very noisy area we had hardly any sleep with both late night revellers and early morning deliveries. We also had seagulls tapping on the windows at 5am! This time I was staying for pleasure but it's a shame as this hotel is right near my office, but there is no point staying somewhere that noisy if you have to work the next day. I wish I'd spoken to my colleagues before I booked as several of them have had the same experience.",3,2024,08,07
248,A Wondreful Stay at Camden Court,"I have just returned from a three night stay at Camden Court Dublin and cannot recommend this hotel highly enough . From check in to check out the staff could not have been more helpful and pleasant . Every member of staff was lovely and the service was perfect . Being able to have breakfast until 10.30 am made for a more relaxed start to the day and my daughter , who is vegan , was very well catered for . The bar area is a delight to sit in with very pleasing decor and a calming atmosphere . 
The room was very clean and comfortable and the only negative comment I would make would be that the pillows were far too soft and not great for sleeping but I suppose that is down to personal preference .
At the hint of a queue a member of staff would appear from nowhere to take care of the situation and prevent guests from having to wait . I hope to return to Dublin for a break and will not bother to look for a different hotel because this one is so good . It is also very close to the town and Airport pick up . 
This hotel is so well managed and our stay was just wonderful !!!",5,2024,08,04
248,Lovely hotel made by the staff,"What a great hotel.From the moment you arrive you are made to feel special.

In my opinion the hotel is ideally situated with just a 10/15 minute walk into the city.

The hotel is very clean,our room was very comfortable,the shower was great,the bed is huge & im sure are on different time zones !

Nice touch with the dressing gowns also.
My only complaint is how hot the rooms get even with the little fan & the window open.We found the little fan did virtually nothing so I would possibly suggest a bigger stand fan or as others have suggested installing air con in the rooms,not sure if this is a plausible solution due to the cost etc but on our stay it was mainly cloudy but was 19/20 degrees so not exactly cracking the pavements but it still made the rooms uncomfortable especially on a night for sleeping.

It was great having the leisure facilities & the pool which my partner & I enjoyed.

Now the breakfast…………wow ! Compared to places you can go for breakfast the price you pay is really very good.
The choice & standard are exceptional,all very fresh & very tasty.Make sure you read the menu as you can order omelettes,pancakes,poached eggs & so unless you read the menu you wouldn’t know that these are available.

The staff are very attentive & special mention has to go to Joy;wow what an amazing lady! She just couldn’t do enough & we so looked forward to seeing her on a morning from her beaming smile,warm welcome,her attentive service & even though she was extremely busy she always had time to speak to us about our day ahead & would also recommend places or bars for us to visit.I hope our comments get passed on to Joy as she really is a credit to your team-Thank you!

Overall a fantastic stay so thank you Camden Court Hotel

Paul & Jan",5,2024,07,28
248,Great location in Dublin,"6 of us friends stayed 6 nights @ the Camden Court Hotel. It is a lovely hotel with a great location & ample space around it. The rooms were comfy & breakfast was very good. It had a large seating area around the lobby with a bar & various options too. It even had a sitting area outside with benches to sit in the summer. The only drawback was that the bar did not stock enough Irish whisky. Otherwise,  a great stay. ",5,2024,07,22
248,Some improvements needed - breakfast service,"Constructive: 

Unfortunately the tea and coffee service at the breakfast buffet still hasn't been rectified, though I can see this mentioned in other reviews. I have also explicitly mentioned this to the manager on shift. Some days they offer it while seating you and other days it's like getting blood out of a stone. Suggestion: either have a station where guests can help themselves, or have someone going around just giving the guests tea and coffee. It shouldn't be hard!

There is a tall slim older chap with greyish hair who could do with some customer service training. When I asked politely for tea and coffee he muttered something under his breath and my husband heard him on a separate occasion swearing about something. He is also quite starey and served my husbands breakfast badly at the buffet (doorstop of roast bacon anyone). 

The milk and cereal station seem to run out quite frequently and more attention is needed in that area. 

The rooms really need to have aircon installed. We used the two fans provided, but for some reason the hotel is hotter than external temperatures in summer. We were sweltering and it's quite hard to sleep.

The staff on the gym facilities also could do with some training. Other than one lady, they all seemed like they had given up and did not care that the jacuzzi was hotter than was bearable to use. 

Positives:

The pool, sauna and steam room facilities were a nice bonus.

The general presentation of the hotel is high.

The location of the hotel is convenient.",3,2024,07,20
248,Great spot for a family city break in Dublin,"We stayed here on a family night away in Dublin this week and were really impressed.    The location of the hotel is perfect, a 3 minute walk to Harcourt Luas (tram) stop or a 12 minute walk to the top of Grafton St.   Very nice room with a large TV (Netflix etc. available to log into), fridge and great pillows!  Swimming pool was perfect as well. 
It was the staff though that really added to our impression of this hotel.  My daughter was feeling sick and, although we had already checked out (early), a very efficient guy on reception let us back into our room and extended check-out by an hour.    Also noticed him spending time with some tourists giving them great information and details about the city.   All in all, a lovely stay.",5,2024,07,20
248,Loved it,"This is just a lovely hotel from the moment you enter. What sets it apart is the staff. They cannot do enough for you. So attentive.
Would like to highlight a young man I think was called Jack at the front desk he could not have been more helpful. Not just to me but I observed him with other guests, what an asset to the hotel. The rooms are fab, bed is huge and so fresh clean and comfortable. Breakfast was lovely with baked gammon and a whole host of hot and cold options. Most of all I liked the atmosphere in the hotel, apart from a creepy staff member who tried to sell me cigarettes in the smoking area 🤦‍♀️ the staff genuinely appear to really like working there. Which is a rarity these days. Thoroughly enjoyed my stay 👍",5,2024,07,20
248,"Nice Hotel, good location. Could work on customer service.","We enjoyed our stay at Camden Court Hotel. The room was very nice. The location was perfect for us as we were attending a music event at The Iveagh Gardens. We had some small issues but nothing that would prevent us staying again. The website has a FAQ section which says ""Room service is provided 24 hours"", however, this is incorrect and should be removed from the website. We could not get room service at approximately midnight. Some of the staff members could use some customer service training such as the breakfast greeter & the staff in the breakfast room. We were in the middle of two tables that were offered tea/coffee but our table was skipped. It was hard to get their attention to get coffee after that. I found the main greeter fairly rude. But I think these are minor things and would stay here again. The breakfast itself was lovely and the reception staff were friendly and helpful.",4,2024,07,07
248,Lovely!,"This hotel was a short bus ride out of the city centre and a perfect choice for Dublin. The rooms were updated and clean and very comfortable.  The hotel itself had a beautiful  lobby, breakfast and pool. The staff was friendly and cheerful. I would absolutely  stay here again!",5,2024,07,06
248,Quaint hotel about a mile from downtown Dublin,"Very nice breakfast choices and freshly made coffee variations as well.  Staff is very helpful.  A bit of a walk to downtown Dublin (especially during the rain).  Room was a bit tight, but very clean.  Quiet at night except for the seagulls.  No air conditioning but they had fans that helped.  Had to live with the seagulls and fan to cool the room down.  Interesting because it was cold outside.",4,2024,07,02
248,Great experience,"Great hotel. Clean, modern room and easy access to the city. Nice toiletries, comfy bed and soft fluffy towels. We had both dinner and breakfast and both were excellent. We were particularly impressed with the breakfast. Staff were great, Chloe went out of her way to make sure we enjoyed our stay. Thank you!",5,2024,06,23
248,"Nice room, hot spa, great breakfast and lovely staff who went above and beyond!","Just had a stay at the Camden Court Hotel. Lovely hotel with comfortable rooms. The staff are really friendly and nothing seemed too much of an ask. We had breakfast which was great. The selection on offer is vast including continental cold meat and cheeses, cereals and fruit. The carrot juice was a nice alternative. The hot meal was lovely. Chloe the manager in the restaurant was especially great and was able to cater to my medical dietry requirements. 
Also enjoyed the added bonus of using the pool and sauna after a fun night out.

We would definitely come back to stay again next time we are in Dublin.",5,2024,06,23
248,It was okay ,"Stayed here with a group. Room was tidy but a bit small for two people. I found the lighting a bit too bright. Especially the TL light wich enveloped the mirror in the bathroom. I didn't find a switch to turn it off. Breakfast was okay and varied. I love that they had sourdough bread.   We had some time left to spend in Dublin before flying back to NL.  After check-out we could leave our luggage in the hotel for free, wich I appreciate. Overall I can't complain. ",4,2024,06,17
248,Nice stay with the exception of one rude housekeeping staff member,"The hotel  was nice  with a spacious clean bedroom and en-suite  ,the  beds were very comfy , nice pool and lobby area  to relax with a drink .The location was handy for local pubs / restaurants and only a short Uber ride to others . The Only downside to our stay  was we that encountered one extremely rude and argumentative female housekeeping staff member upon leaving our room to check out .",3,2024,06,15
248,Great stay,"We both loved this hotel very much, it was In a great location that suited us, the hotel is impressive, very well maintained and presented, the staff all do a great job, we found them all so helpful, we also very much enjoyed the outstanding breakfast served, bar prices pretty much the same as other outside bars on some things  except for when I ordered 4 shots of baby Guinness to my horror they charged me a staggering 38 euros, this was daylight robbery we paid half of that at temple bar and that's still expensive, do feel I was ripped off and did not use the bar during our stay again after this, overall I would return but stay clear of the bar area, lovely bar next door called the bleeding horse at much more sensible prices. Don't be put off the hotel overall is excellent.",4,2024,06,11
248,6 Nations,"Fab hotel. Our first room was very noisy at night but the lovely staff very happily moved us & couldn’t have done enough. Lovely rooms, clean, comfy, tidy. The leisure facilities are good and again staff were fab. Great breakfast. Defo be back here. Half hour walk to the Aviva and not to far either  whiskey museum and shops.",5,2024,06,07
248,Beyond the call of duty,I want to acknowledge the wonderful support I received from Duty Manager Chloe and Reception Supervisor Melissa who helped resolve my car park query today (June 5th). I couldn't have asked for more helpful / supportive ladies. My thanks to you both!,5,2024,06,05
248,A nice stay,"Nice hotel in a good area close to town. Can easily walk into town from hotel. The hotel has a great pool which is lovely. Enjoyed my stay and would stay again. Rooms are very nice. Voya products and coffee machines. Nice and helpful staff. Nice area in general with nice little cafes, shops and pubs.",4,2024,06,04
248,Thoroughly enjoyed the CC!,"Pros:
- upon arrival, the attendant outside was friendly and helpful in leading us to the parking garage into an available spot.  He was the best employee at the hotel that we encountered.  
- location - near St. Stephen's Gardens, a hop-on hop-off stop and a <30 min walk to all the major attractions.  
- the room was nicely decorated and had a coffee machine, kettle for tea, complimentary water, fridge, the plushest robes, slippers and I always appreciate a bathroom with a make-up mirror.  Our room didn't face the street so found it very quiet.
- the shower pressure was great!
- enjoyed the use of the pool, hot tub (not hot enough), steam room (my fave) and sauna.

Cons:
- seemed to only be one elevator which we only used upon arrival and checking out.  We were on the 4th floor so we would just take the stairs.
- parking is 20 euros/night but I guess that's the norm in the Dublin city centre.
- the person at the pool/fitness centre area really hated her job and always looked sour.",5,2024,05,23
248,"Great Location, Wonderful Service","We are absolutely thrilled with this hotel.  From the front desk staff to the restaurant staff we have received nothing but good and very cheerful service.  The safe in our room wouldn’t close so we made the front desk aware.  Someone was at our room in minutes.  When Carmen couldn’t fix the problem she called Chloe, the manager.  She was here instantly. Not being able to solve it either she let maintenance know about it.  Two lovely guys showed up to fix it and all that was needed was a new battery.  From start to successful finish we received great customer service.   As for the previous comments from the guest on the 2nd floor, our room is on the street as well.  We heard the footie fans celebrating last night as well, but this is a city!!  You have to expect some nighttime noise.  If you don’t want to open your window there is a fan provided in the room.  We would highly recommend the Camden Court to anyone travelling to Dublin",5,2024,05,23
248,I genuinely hope there is better than this.,"I really wanted to like this place. There was a lot of building/renovation work going on, which  obviously took the shine off, because of the noise etc.

But the thing that really bothered me was, I went down to reception to ask for a bottle opener, and was advised to go to the bar for one. 

I duly did this, and was told by the flamboyant man behind the bar, “No.” No explanation, no apology, just “No.” I wasn’t sure what to say: I could see a bottle opener on the bar behind him, so I’m not sure what the issue was. He had a poor command of English, so was that it? I don’t know. Embarrassed, and flanked by American businessmen, I skulked away. (Would they have been refused?)

I brought up the issue upon leaving, and was told I could have a free coffee to make up for it. (????) Not really a solution. I run a business, and would be affronted if my customers had had such a basic and easily rectified issue.

Just another situation where blatant rudeness trumps basic everyday decency, I suppose.",3,2024,05,21
248,Don't expect help or empathy you won't get it.,"Despite contacting the hotel to say I was hospitalised and couldn't turn up, I was informed it was within the 24hrs needed to cancel and defer my stay for a week. The response was  I'd have to pay the full amount as per the cancellation policy. I have stayed here on numerous occasions over the last number of years including during lock down as an essential worker when they were happy for my custom in a near empty hotel and it appears they will help until you have a problem.",1,2024,05,21
248,Great location but noisy,"Great location if this is your first time to Dublin. 
Very busy hotel with lots of tour, conference & corporates.
We were roadside on the 2nd floor & and unfortunately, no other ventilation other than leaving the very small  window open to get some air flow, & street noise from rowdy resellers to the small hours had us awake a lot every night.
Paper thin walls. We could hear Barry's partner groaning his name to stop twisting her arm. 
Big shout out to Chloe, who we met at the restaurant on our last morning of our stay. 
The food in the restaurant was good.

248,When can I come back?,"This hotel is amazing, so clean and the bed is very comfortable, perhaps too comfortable, don’t forget to set an alarm! Everyone is kind and friendly. I was really impressed with the leisure facilities, I had forgotten my swimming costume but no problem they have them for sale, Klaudia who was on duty at the time was wonderful, so helpful, she made my experience very positive, thanks Klaudia!

I also had room service, that was quick and the food was hot and delicious.

Breakfast excellent and bar food also. Room and public areas spotlessly clean. Our only issue was traffic noise but that didn’t cause huge problems 
Overall very good hotel for a city break.",4,2024,05,13
248,Good location and great hotel!,"A really nice Hotel with excellent service and delicious breakfast. The location was perfekt for us, around 15 min Walk to tempel bar. We highly recommend this hotel, it was modern, clean, comfortable beds and very helpful staff. We didnt have time to try the pool but Will definitly do so next time.",5,2024,05,12
248,Home from Home Hotel,A regular user of Hotels in Dublin for work for many years the Camden Court always gives a very homely feel to it which is a big positive for those of us away from home for work . Lovely Pool to unwind and gym for the more energetic . Location is excellent just to the south of Stephens Green/Grafton Street and also close to the vibrant rathmines village the other direction. Rooms are very comfy . Staff are always friendly with Andjelka on the front desk a particulary efficient & Friendly staff member !,5,2024,05,09
248,Lovely hotel and so clean!,"The hotel was clean, staff was so kind and caring, and the free breakfast was delicious and a lot to eat. It’s located close to everything in Dublin. Staff was so helpful to give advice. Sign up for the Do Dublin Hop on Hop off bus to help get around.",5,2024,05,01
248,Very good stay,"Stayed here on a Saturday night in April. This is a very busy hotel but check in and out was smooth. 

Room is a good size and double bed (which was 2 singles pushed together) was very large and comfortable. The black out curtains in the room work well and although a very busy Saturday night there was no noise. Bathroom is ok size and shower worked well. 

Breakfast was very good which a large choice. We had breakfast around 9am and wasn’t overly busy at that time. We didn’t use the hotel bar or restaurant. 

Hotel has a good leisure centre which was quiet on a Sunday morning. The hotel has parking but we did not use. 

Location is great but lots of bars and restaurants near by. There is also a Luas stop very close to hotel. 

Only small negative is fact that there is only 1 lift in hotel and is very slow to get one. You would be better on a lower floor so you could take the stairs. 

Overall very good visit and would stay again.",5,2024,04,21
248,Great Dublin Hotel with Indoor Pool,"Great hotel with caring, efficient staff. Rooms were clean, included breakfast was amazing,and bar served good drinks. Nice location on Dublin, and an added bonus, a great indoor swimming pool, sauna, hot tub & workout area!  A special shoutout to Cloie, the evening manager, for helping tired tourists!",5,2024,04,19
248,Comfortable and good location,"We stayed over Easter weekend in this modern and excellently located hotel. Easy to get to from the airport as the Dublin Express stops right around the corner, the hotel is also surrounded by lots of lovely cafes, restaurants and brunch spots, and within walking distance of Trinity and other city locations.

The hotel has been recently re-styled and its decor feels modern and stylish. Rooms are well appointed and clean, with lovely toiletries, plenty of towels and robes / slippers giving a luxury feel. The room was warm and beds comfortable. My friend found our room at the front of the building far too noisy to sleep, so bring earplugs. The hotel were able to move us to an internal courtyard room when requested with no issues, and this was quieter.

We didn't opt for breakfast as there are so many nice cafes nearby, but did have a coffee one afternoon and an informal supper on the first evening. Both were good, and priced in line with other places in Dublin. Staff were friendly and attentive.

Though there is a pool / spa this was the biggest disappointment of our stay. The three loungers were 'reserved' by towels for our whole visit by people who never actually sat there. And the pool itself was not usable for a swim as there were around 12 unaccompanied children in there the whole time, bombing, splashing and generally treating the spa like a kids club. Whilst this is again more down to the selfishness of other guests than the fault of the hotel, the 'no unaccompanied children' signs could have been more effectively enforced and monitored.",4,2024,04,06
248,They should shut the restaurant,"There are no words to describe how bad the restaurant is within the hotel. On our second night we went to book a table for two only to be told that the kitchen is open but everyone has to eat in the foyer. I asked if there was a discount on the menu due to having to eat in the lobby and was told it is full price. We decided to head into the city instead of eating off our knees. 

The next morning we had a lovely late rise and decided to head down for breakfast (we hadn’t book)
The young man at the door happily took the €36 off us for 2 breakfasts and proceeded to guide us through the restaurant to see if he could find a single table that wasn’t filthy with dirty plates, food, drinks, serviettes. Finally we were seating right at the back and off we went for food. The egg was nice, the toast was ok, and the beans were good. Everything else was below what you would expect in this type of establishment. We had to ask 3 different members of staff for a hot drink and then when we went up to sample the fresh fruit, they had cleared the hot, and cold bars down. Obviously closing down for the morning. We arrived at the restaurant at 10:20am, if we had been told that there was a limited service, we would have walking into the city as the night before. 

Hotel its self is ok, good walking distance to main attractions. 

Restaurant was disgusting and a complete waste of money. You are better off eating at the amazing food places all over Dublin.",2,2024,04,04
248,Excellent loved it,I stayed here with my mum in March 2024 for a special birthday. I emailed the day before to ask for an early check in which was obliged and they also left her some chocolates which was a lovely touch. There was some building work going on above my room which woke me at 8:00am...maybe start the work at 10:00am? I did bring this to the attention of the hotel and we were offered a free lunch which we were pleased with. This is a lovely hotel and the staff are very helpful. The food is beautiful and well worth it. The spa was also nice although people shouldn't be allowed to reserve the loungers if they are using other facilities. There was only 3 to choose from so I think this is something the spa staff should enforce. I come to Dublin a lot as I have family here and normally stay somewhere cheaper but I wouldn't stay anywhere else again as I loved this hotel. ,5,2024,04,01
248,I'll be back,Really enjoyable hotel. Rooms lovely and clean and the eco shower is fabulous. Close to Stephens Green and Camden Street itself was nice and vibrant with lots going on. Food is delicious especially the buffet breakfast and Chloe the duty manager was wonderful and couldn't have been more helpful to us during our stay. We will definitely be back for sure,5,2024,03,30
248,Definitely recommend,"Another fantastic stay at this hotel... 3rd time to come here with my husband in 2 years we pick this hotel everytime we go to the city. Beautiful decor, lovely atmosphere best location close to all the bars & shops. Relaxing stay with carpark, pool everything you need. Chloe the duty manager was excellent very friendly, went above & beyond to make sure we had a good time during our stay! Definitely recommend 👌",5,2024,03,30
248,Disappointment turned to frustration,"Booked two rooms for a couple of nights for a milestone birthday and celebrating a serious health thing being over.

I was supposed to be in a King room (the person booking mentioned why this was a special stay etc), but it was two singles pushed together (not the best sleep). The room was also very hot and there was no air con. The other two guests had a twin room on a different floor. They also mentioned it was stifling in their room.

At around 7am, I was woken up by builders in the hotel (banging, thumping, drilling etc). When I went down to breakfast, the other two guests reported the same thing and asked to change room away from the construction work. I told them I was woken too, so the person who booked the rooms asked for my room to be swapped as well. The receptionist we spoke to seemed totally unaware of the building work and was a bit, erm, 'sulky' at us for asking to change both rooms (we were polite about it). 

We were told we could get new keys in a couple of hours for new rooms, so we thanked them and went into the restaurant to have the breakfast we paid for. That said, no one apologised to us for the noise and we were treated as if we were lying which wasn't great...

Breakfast was an interesting experience. The food was lovely and the hot food server was nice and friendly. However, the chairs were dirty and trying to get some hot tea was a mission. We asked one of the waiters if we could get a pot of tea. She went away for a few minutes, then came back out onto the floor and ignored us. She clearly forgot about the tea. They also weren't busy in the restaurant but lots of tables had reservations signs on them but I suspect that's because they hadn't been cleaned yet. Anyway, we asked her again about the tea, she nodded her head and went away again, coming back 15 minutes later without a word and plonking it on the table.

We had a thing to go to so quickly packed up and left the hotel to explore the city centre etc. We came back a couple of hours later as they said to do, to new reception staff and asked for our keys. They said they weren't told about the room change so we had to go over again why we were changing rooms and wait while the receptionist went into a back room to speak to a manager, again, no apology olfor the faff or anything, and it felt like we were the problem. They also didn't have a king-size room, so I took a room with two singles (to be fair, the younger lad on the front desk did ask if I wanted them pushed together, but I just wanted to get in a room without anymore waiting around and lie down for a bit so declined the offer). The room I was now in was a cheaper rate so I did kinda want some money back for the difference but that wasn't forthcoming. Instead, we were offered a 'free dinner at the restaurant' and were told the evening manager would be informed. Not looking a gift horse in the mouth we canceled the off-site dinner reservation we made for my birthday and stayed in the hotel for dinner.

However, the evening manager didn't seem to know anything about this and, again, there was just a bit of an attitude vibe happening which again made us feel we were the problem and asking too much for their muck ups.  We were then repeatedly told we'd only get a main and dessert, everything else we pay for. Like, we understood but it really did come across as if we were out for a free ride, when actually the hotel was at fault and we'd spent a lot of money on getting certain rooms that should've been decent and well equipped for a supposed 4 star hotel (only one lift servicing the floors, no air con, singles pushed together and sold as a 'king', dirty seating areas etc)

We were also told we couldn't sit in the restaurant, so they brought the food out to the general seating area. After eating, the manager came over to us again and said in quite an arrogant tone something about free food tasting better as if she'd done us a favour. The food was nice and our server was also lovely but some of the extras we paid for didn't come out to us until a long time after eating the main meal - steak and then broccoli by itself 25 mins later.

I also had a late check out arranged for the following day. I checked it twice and both times the different reception staff said they had it on their records. Next day, after breakfast I went out and came back to pack and leave, but my card had been deactivated two hours before I was due to check out so I had to go back downstairs and explain again that this was already arranged (the manager on the front desk already confirmed it early - again, no apology or anything.)

Overall, I wouldn't say this is a 4 star hotel. Some of the staff were rude (others were super nice though), the handover communications were poor, and I don't think some of the staff knew how to say sorry when they mucked up, rather it was us being seen as the problem. Having worked in customer services, I get it - you're probably underpaid etc, but it wasn't as if it was a busy period or we were being rude. In fact, we were embarrassed at how many times things went wrong.

The facilities generally weren't that great for how this hotel markets itself either. So yeah, disappointed on the whole with day and evening 'sales managers' and some of the staff.

We also noticed halfway through our stay that they did change the lift advert to mention about the refurbishment, but there was nothing on their website and it was a little too late.

Also, in my new room, there was a very loud electrical sound coming from the wall between the bed and shower room which started in the early am of my check out day - not sure if that was part of the refurbishment works or some other kind of electrical fault.",2,2024,03,22
248,Clover Thai Massage,Amazing Experience one of the best I have ever had she was very hard in a nice way loved it really amazing I would acc recommend I had so much pain in my neck Back and leg and she made sure she attended to all my pain and the price was decent as well deffo come again,5,2024,03,21
248,Always a great experience,"I stay here about twice a month and I must say that the staff are amazing. No matter where I'm working in the city centre I stay in the Camden court hotel. Ample parking and ease of exit from the city 
Chloe is a diamond and always so helpful. Nothing is a problem and she's a font of local knowledge on where to go and what to do with your spare time. 
Thanks a million Chloe

248,Pedro at Camden was Superb!,"Staff was friendly, courteous, attentive and accommodating. They made me feel at home and helped me with my travel. Kudos goes to Pedro. The place was modern and clean. It reminds me of an old quaint times where inns were inns. Prompt service was provided immediately. Thank you much so the friendship and hospitality.",5,2024,03,10
248,Nice location and amenities,This hotel is in a great location to walk around and explore Dublin. We landed very early and they were very accommodating in trying to get us into the hotel early despite it being very full. Breakfast each morning was lovely and I was impressed with the hotel amenities.,5,2024,02,25
248,"Unhinged Late Night Receptionist on Superbowl Sunday (February 11th, 2024)","After the superbowl, we had tried to get a room but the late night receptionist rudely said no without even checking. He would not even let us wait in the lobby while we were waiting for a taxi, and threatened us. It seemed this unhinged individual was looking for a fight perhaps because of our skin colour. He did not even allow us to wait outside the hotel. He pushed us off into an unsafe area. WE ASKED FOR HIS NAME AND HE WOULD NOT TELL US. THIS INDIVIDUAL SHOULD BE FIRED AND SHOULD NOT BE ALLOWED TO WORK AS A HOTEL RECEPTIONIST AGAIN OR ESPECIALLY SINCE THIS IS A HOSPITALITY BUSINESS. THIS WOULD NEVER HAPPEN IN NORTH AMERICA, WITH THIS KIND OF SERVICE HE WOULD BE FIRED. All other hotels in Dublin have been great",1,2024,02,12
248,Worst hospitality and customer service,"I witnessed the worst hospitality and customer service by the night staff on Feb11/12th towards two boys. The person was extremelely rude and abused his position of Power and authority. He then went on to show true intentions and further targeted the innocent boys. It was obvious by the conversation why he targetted them (sad to say but it was probably because they were coloured). My last post was deleted probably at request of the hotel but this behaviour, lack of service, lack of humanity and abuse of power should not be ignored and future customers booking should know.",1,2024,02,12

248,"A Great Place to Stay, but Too Short a Visit","I returned to the Camden Court Hotel after four years last October, and I am glad to say that the hotel is still as good as ever. The staff, as before, were very helpful and accommodating, and the room was quite comfortable. The hotel is not far from several landmarks, historical sites, and quite a few spots in Dublin's nightlife. They also have an excellent breakfast that I was able to have before heading out. I only wish that I had been able to stay longer this time.",4,2024,01,22
248,Wonderful Service,Booked in at 3pm but the room was not ready. Duty Manger immediately offered us an upgrade to a suite plus a free drink on the house. Suite was superb with excellent coffee machine and two Tvs. If you liked heat then this would suit you very well.,5,2024,01,08

248,Xmas party what a waste of money,"Had our Xmas Christmas party food disgraceful, turkey n ham was pre packed  that was cold on night. Dessert was not much better must have been left out as the pastry didn’t taste right. The service was disgraceful we where told to be there for 7 seated at 7.30pm our starter didn’t come out till 9 our main nearly 10.pm which had to be sent back due to cold one potato lump which had the processed turkey n ham lump with two sprouts n I stem of broccoli and the desert came out at 10.45pm what a miserable night for 89euro a head . Don’t book for a Xmas party waste of money n a let down.

248,Camden Court Hotel Christmas night avoid,Myself and my work colleagues booked here for the 16th December 2023. For Christmas staff night. We were seated at 7.45. Order taking immediately. Starter arrived hour later. Main meal another hour later and was cold We returned all 10 meals. When they replaced the meals one had been already partially eaten so we know it was either one of ours or someone else's. Dessert arrived at 11. People left to actually get something to eat.!!!! A round of drink was offered as way of an apology which is not good enough. After paying 89 euros for this disaster of a night would never recommend here. Abysmal service and avoid at all costs ,1,2023,12,18
248,Great hotel would stay there again,"Great location close to restaurants, shops and transport.  The hotel is well decorated, clean and bright.  Swimming pool and spa clean and staff professional and friendly. Great choice at breakfast and staff throughout the hotel were polite and professional",5,2023,12,17
248,Best coffee,"Cloe, the manager, impresses with her exceptional coffee skills. Her precision in crafting each cup reflects a true artisan. The rich aroma and nuanced flavors showcase her dedication to the craft. Coupled with her warm demeanor, Cloe creates a delightful coffee experience that keeps customers coming back.",5,2023,12,01
248,Ok,"We've stayed in the Camden Court a few times. This time we stayed for the Marathon. We booked well in advance. No issues with the room or checking in.

The bar was under pressure dealing with the crowds. But staff were lovely to deal with.

The room was lovely and clean. We were in 222 and you could hear the traffic outside. Luckily it didn't impact our sleep.

The breakfast was delicious, great selection and quality.

We paid €445 for two nights bed and breakfast, we were extremely disappointed to contact the hotel to book in for the 2024 marathon to be given the price of €628 (not including breakfast) €692 if we want the pleasure of adding breakfast. That's a huge jump of €247. Dublin hotels are really losing the run of themselves and it's so disappointing. Shame on them. We won't be staying next year.",3,2023,11,06
248,The staff make this hotel great.,"I found the staff friendly and professional. Hotel was clean and modern. Price was very reasonable. Location is excellent for visiting Dublin City. Pool and facilities were excellent. Next time I’m visiting Dublin,this hotel will be my first choice.",5,2023,10,31
248,I wouldn’t stay here again.,A big disappointment.  The good news - nice bar and restaurant area for gathering.  The lifts were operational and always available.  Breakfast was good but overpriced unless you want full Irish. The bad - very poor attention to detail.  I had a non operable “taped together” lamp that I complained about but nobody came to fix.  My plumbing made so much noise I thought the room was haunted.  The heat blasts whether you need it or not - no individual controls.  And a workman started renovating the room next door at 8 am.  The first night I had “face cloths” but never again.  The room was tiny of course.  The staff was very nice.,3,2023,10,31
248,GOOD LOCATION,"Location is great for seeing the main sights in Dublin, very close to the Luas, 2 minute walk.  St Stephens Green and the main museums all within walking distance.  Breakfast was good, all the usual choices, good continental selection and all seemed very fresh.  

We booked dinner in The Iveagh hotel restaurant one night and that was disappointing.  Only about 6 other tables dining at 8.30pm told the story.  Service was poor, waitress did not understand what drinks we ordered, a club orange and a bottle of Orchard Thieves, a second waiter came to check the order.  My wife ordered the burger and she was asked if she wanted the beef burger, there is only one on the menu.  I ordered the lamb.  We had no starter and the wait for the mains was too long based on very few customers in the restaurant.  When we finished the mains, which were all acceptable but not outstanding, we sat and finished our drinks.  No waiting staff came to check on us to see if we wanted a desert or tea and coffee.  

Our suite was advertised as including tea/coffee making facility, water and biscuits and complimentary newspaper.  There were no biscuits and no paper and no hair drier.  When queried at the desk we were told the newspapers were at the front desk and they did not provide biscuits. We asked why this was advertised as part of the benefits of booking a suite we were met with a shrug of the shoulders by the staff.  When we arrived back in our room we found 4 cookies and a hair drier had arrived, very welcome.  However, we only ate 3 that night and the next day room service removed the 4th cookie.  

I used the swimming pool every day, unfortunately there was building work ongoing in the changing rooms which meant no showers available, but the pool area is very good and well maintained.

When we checked out after 3 nights stay no one asked about our visit and we found the staff aloof and not very welcoming, no Cead Mile Failte.  

We booked one of the top rooms in the hotel and it was fine, but not special, with a 4 star rating we were expecting something a little better.

248,Superb hotel and staff,"Excellent hôtel, excellent staff, location perfect and nothing bad to say…..thoroughly recommend the hotel for when you visit Dublin…..bravo to Eoin and the whole team who all went out of their way to look after us and make our stay a pleasant one ",5,2023,10,27
248,"Hotel is lovely , needs a bit of tlc","The location is brilliant,  we came from heuston on the red then the green luas. The hotel itself is lovely, staff are very friendly. What let's it down badly is the breakfast and the leisure centre. The breakfast was probably the worst I've ever eaten. The rashers were so hard they were inedible, the sausages tasted awful , the pudding was rock hard , the scrambled eggs were soggy and the mushrooms were covered in over powering herbs. What saved the breakfast were the pastries and coffee.

We went to the pool - sorry we did. The pool itself was a nice temperature but there was a hose running through to the back of the building , easy to trip over. The jacuzzi was out of order and the walls of the pool need a good clean. 

We had a good night sleep , beds were comfy. Lovely shower , all facilities in the room hairdryer , TV etc. Would stay again and use as a base but room only",3,2023,10,17

248,AVOID AT ALL COSTS! The worst hotel we’ve ever visited.,"Shocking standards, rude staff and very unhygienic. There was no air conditioning throughout and not even a fridge in the room to cool our bottle of water. The curtain net had dirt up them and holes throughout. The room didn’t match what we were sold. It looked like a room from the 70’s. It was dirty and unhygienic (womens long black hairs in the bed, on my bath towel and in the sink. There was dirt on the carpet and up the walls. It had literally never been dusts, there was thick untouched dust on the top of the bed head. Wires dangling down.  We went down to reception where we quietly asked to raise a complaint.

Later that day we were moved to another room by one of the managers (Fernando). Fernando then promised us a full refund for the day/night we had in the previous room and asked that we brought my bank card to reception for him to return the refund to the next day and that he was working 7am-3pm. We were happy to do so and carry on with trying to enjoy our couples break in Dublin. However, the new room that we had been moved to had a light out in one of the main down lights and Fernando apologised saying “sh*t, what are the chance of this. I am very sorry, a hotel of the price should not be having all of these issues”. Fernando then told us it just needed a new bulb and he left to get one. Once he returned, he quickly gave my partner a new bulb at the door and dashed off and left her to fit the bulb herself (which is clearly unsafe and a hazard). There was also men’s hair in the bathroom of this room and dirt in the shower, what on earth were the cleaners actually doing in this hotel?!

Later that day, Fernando knocked at our door and proceeded to tell us that he had spoken with another manager and the other manager had told him we wouldn’t be given the full refund which had been promised to us. He was apologetic and shaking his head as this was clearly above him and he didn’t agree with this decision. He then took me down to the reception to have a conversation with the other manager. I didn’t get the name of him. The second manager was incredibly rude and arrogant, he just outright declined the full refund and walked away from me. We are still without! Booking.com are trying to recover our money but the hotel will not respond to them. Shocking!",1,2023,10,16
248,Great hotel! Great location. Lovely spa and pool! ,Loved this hotel. Comfortable beds. Clean room. Bedroom was massive and we got upgraded! Swimming pool and spa was lovely. It didn’t bother me but be aware it’s a very popular hotel and in reception it will be loud if your room is there. Luckily we were high upstairs so it wasn’t an issue. Great location too! ,5,2023,10,06
248,Amazing!!,"Fantastic!!! Couldnt rate the Camden Court Hotel more highly. The hotel itself is gorgeous, appears newly renovated, so spacious, clean, great location & just overall fantastic. The staff couldnt have looked after us better. Jamie who looked after us months in advance for a group reservation - i’ve never dealt with anyone as accommodating. He made everything completely stress free & so enjoyable. All the front desk staff, and concierges were fab. I, and so many others in the group will most definitely be booking here again.

248,Great hotel but skip the breakfast,"Good hotel, great location, very comfortable beds in rooms, rooms always very clean, nice products in rooms(voya) appreciate the water bottles in rooms, but very slow check in (I’ve stayed several times and always mass confusion when checking in) and, do you self a favour and skip the breakfast. 
I generally go for a corp room only rate. But decided to go with B&B the last couple of times. Never again. 
The breakfast is truly the worst I’ve ever had in any hotel- I’ve had it both in the room and in the restaurant. When having it in the restaurant  - I realised after having a spoon of yoghurt with fruit that the yoghurt was completely sour, which put me off having anything else. 
Next time staying, I decided to have room service, and avoided the yoghurt.  The bacon was rock hard, the sausages were pretty much raw- they were served both white and cold- completely inedible, beans, hash-browns and eggs were  all stone cold, and no toast or pastries arrived. I called down for some toast and after 15 minutes, someone knocked on the door bringing ONE single slice of “toast” - it was actually a single slice of white bread,  definitely not toasted. So the breakfast couldn’t even be redeemed by simply having tea and toast (and why just come up with one slice??!!). Truly the worst breakfasts I’ve ever had.",3,2023,09,30

248,An average experience,"The hotel is pretty well located for tourist attractions, office areas and public transport. My room was pretty dated but the bed was comfortable. The hotel is pretty noisy inside until late at night. It's right next to a few bars and so there's a lot of outside noise, my room didn't have AC so meant having the windows open and having to put up with the noise from outside.

248,"It was not a great start, but Ivan from the front desk put things right!","My best friend and I stayed at this hotel for a weekend getaway in Dublin, last weekend between Friday and Sunday. It was not a great start as we were given a king size bed despite requesting for two single beds via our travel agent. However, Ivan from the front desk helped us to put things right by asking the housekeeping to separate the bed into two. This was done promptly and when I came down a few hours later, Ivan came and asked whether the issue was sorted. Great customer service. The hotel concourse has a nice flow and we spent our final night here for late night drinks. The hotel room was nice and the breakfast was good too. The hotel was busy with tourists from different parts of the world, but the hotel staff helped to deal with the traffic smoothly. Perhaps the hotel management can consider reducing the noise coming from the vehicles and guests at the back of the hotel. We stayed in room 333, and when we opened the window, the noise from the back of the hotel was echo-y during midnight and early morning. Otherwise, we look forward to coming back to this hotel. Thank you for making our stay pleasant and enjoyable.",5,2023,09,11

248,Perfect City Hotel,"The best location for walking around Dublin & being close to the major areas, but far enough that there is some calmness! Beautiful hotel with well appointed rooms. They are small  but well turned out, clean, and felt very upscale. 

Breakfast buffet is plentiful and the lobby area is the perfect spot for a drink in the evening. 

Loved the area around the hotel-lots of more 'local' feeling spots. Restaurants are a quick walk, many 3-5 minutes away. We were very impressed. Lots of tour groups seem to come through-can feel busy at times, but that didn't take away from the experience at all. 

Staff was lovely-service was 5 star. ",5,2023,09,08
248,Perfect stay,"We have just returned from a 3 night stay at Camden Court. From the moment we booked, (directly as it was much cheaper than 3rd party sites), the staff could not have been more helpful. They were friendly and attentive and nothing was too much trouble. We only had 1 breakfast in the restaurant as we wanted to explore the restaurants that Dublin had to offer but the one we did have was lovely! The hotel is well positioned for Dublin but not to close to the centre so is quiet and the centre is just a few stops on the LUAS, there’s a stop at the top of the street. 

The spa and gym are well equipped and we both had massages which were fantastic! We won’t hesitate to book here the next time we visit Dublin!",5,2023,09,07
248,very nice business type hotel,"Stayed here for 4 nights - booked on our own a year prior.  Many Notre Dame and a few Navy fans here for the football game.  Great location - 10 to 15 walk to central downtown.  We opted for the Charlotte Suite - had a separate living room and TV, and even a table and 2 chairs outside on the roof veranda.  We did breakfasts on our own.",4,2023,09,06
248,Lovely hotel + amazing pool facilities,"Stayed at the Camden Court Hotel for one night and really enjoyed our stay. The hotel is clean, modern, and welcoming, and the room came readily equipped with hair dryer, ironing board, fan,  coffee machine etc. The hotel is also very central and in close walking distance to all of Dublin's attractions. We especially loved the pool, sauna and steam room! Highly recommend!",5,2023,08,25
248,Lovely stay,"My boyfriend and I had a lovely one night stay at the Camden Court Hotel. The hotel left a card and some chocolates in the room for his birthday, which was a nice touch. Check in was seamless, car -parking was available on site. Hotel room had everything we required, huge bed, water, coffee etc. Hotel was in a great location, a short walk to St.Stephen's green. We really enjoyed our stay :)",5,2023,08,22
248,Would stay again,"Camden Court was a great property in a perfect Dublin location. Very nice well appointed and large rooms, ours had a king bed. One nice feature was about eight usb ports to get everything charged up. 

Only downside was the wifi wasn’t that good in our room. 

The breakfast was very good with a varied selection of hot and cold items. Staff were all super friendly. I would highly recommend staying here. ",5,2023,08,21
248,Dublin treasure - Fab hotel,"Great hotel with friendly and very helpful staff.  Particularly Daniel at reception wha made us feel completely at home.  Comfy beds, clean and great decor.
We used the lovely spa facilities and had one of the best Thai massages with Anne.  Best massage ever and would definitely recommended making a booking for a massage if you stay here.  Lovely steam room, sauna, jacuzzi and swimming pool.  Never used the gym but very well equipped.  Also had the breakfast which caters for all appetites. Would definitely stay here again.",5,2023,08,13
248,Honeymoon perfection,From the moment we arrived nothing was too much trouble for the staff … it was our honeymoon and the chocolates and card in our room was so nice… the room was lovely with every facility you could wish for … including an iron!! …the pool is amazing and much bigger than expected.. I was treated to a wonderful Thai massage .. please visit the lovely girls you won’t be disappointed..Thank you all we had a perfect stay and will see you next year on our first anniversary,5,2023,07,27
248,Great Staff,"I think the staff at this hotel are fantastic. Very helpful and considerate if you need assistance. We were looked after really well. Rooms were lovely. Would definitely stay here again in the future.
",5,2023,07,25
248,Mostly very good,"The front desk and housekeeping staff were top notch and immediately responsive to any need.  The room (recently renovated was neat, clean and well-appointed). Note for Americans: the rooms are not air conditioned.

My only complaint was the complete lack of attentiveness by the wait staff in the lobby/mezzanine restaurant at dinner time.  We waited an unacceptably long time before being greeted and at the end of the meal, we sat with empty dirty plates and drink glasses for more than 20 mins before finding our server to present us our bill.",4,2023,07,22
248,Camden court hotel. A salubrious hotel,"We stayed in the Camden court hotel on a busy Saturday night & we were welcomed straight away by the friendly, welcoming staff. Our room was so clean & the decor amazing. The food was excellent as was the location, which is close to all the nightlife. We will definitely stay here again & would highly recommend it to anyone who wants a fabulous hotel in Dublin. ",5,2023,07,02
248,Bit of an early 2000’s throwback hotel,"Room and hotel was clean and spacious. Unfortunately the room lighting is poor and furniture very dark so not great to work in and makes the room gloomy. No A/C so rooms very hot as well. 

Breakfast was utter chaos. Appreciate they were busy with American tour parties but there were not enough staff present at the restaurant metes de to prevent the tourists barging through when everyone else was doing what they were supposed to do and check in with their room numbers and be shown a table. To get food you have to join a huge queue and get served by one person from the buffet which is so slow. It’s not COVID anymore, be more efficient and let people help themselves. What should have been a quick breakfast took about 25 minutes.

Was here with work, and wouldn’t stay here again to be honest.",3,2023,06,27
248,"Clean room, great food & service","Great room with much needed fan for hot weather. Hotel was clean, staff friendly, breakfast exceptional. Afternoon drinks in the lobby completed the people watching - staff we're on hand to provide great service. Stayed for a concert and had chips in the chip shop opposite the hotel which was also excellent!",5,2023,06,25
248,Satisfying short stay,"I stayed one night at this hotel on my own after I was in the region for a work trip. Overall, I thought the hotel was great and wish I had a bit more time to experience the amenities. The location is great. It’s a close walk to sights and there are good restaurants, bars and convenient shops nearby. The hotel had nice decor and design and the room was pretty spacious. I liked the bathrobes and having both a kettle and coffee maker in the room, along with a mini fridge. The bed was really comfortable. The only uncomfortable part about the room was that it was really warm. The window was fully opened when I arrived, which I assumed because the staff knew it was hot and I couldn’t see or find an AC control. It didn’t affect my stay too much and I appreciated that the window opened. While I would have liked to use the gym, it didn’t open until 6:30 am, which was too late for me. All in all, I would stay again, especially because it was a good price for the space, included amenities and area.",4,2023,06,19
248,Camden court,The hotel was centrally located near Camden Yard and east Tram access.  More of a modern hotel concept with a very nice lounge area in the lobby that served as a bar as well. The Iveagh (ivy) restaurant was the hotel breakfast area and served a full Irish breakfast as well as cafeteria style a la crate.   Staff was very helpful with baggage and restaurant recommendations,4,2023,06,13
248,Sleepless at Camden Court,"The rooms and the hotel appear to be very clean and new.  The rooms were comfortable. The is no A/C so you must leave the window open.  Between the seagulls, crowds leaving the pubs, and doors slamming we didn’t get a very good nights sleep.  
The staff is not very well trained in customer service either.  I stood in line for 20 minutes attempting to check in. There were 5 or 6 people behind the counter with only one person attending to the customers.  All others were either talking to each  other  or checking their computer screens.  Frustrating.  
The restaurant was also late opening in the morning.",3,2023,06,03
248,I didn’t sleep well so can’t recommend staying here,"The good: I guess the location is ok. Everywhere is clean. Bed was comfortable. The foyer is lovely. 

The bad: staff attitude wasn’t great (I asked to change rooms and was told not possible in no uncertain terms when I called Reception - I understand that it’s not always possible to change room types but the manner of being told was poor)

Shower was uncomfortably hot on two of my three days at the hotel, and dangerous at anything other than the lowest temperature. 

My room faced an office block and I was woken early on two mornings either by bins being emptied or car horns beeping

The hotel room doors don’t soft close. Everything slammed at all hours

It was warm and there is no air conditioning 

Summary: an average hotel where - because of the room temperature, the loud doors and outside noises - I didn’t get a good nights sleep once.",2,2023,06,02
248,Wonderful stay,"My friend and I had a wonderful two night stay at the Camden Court Hotel. I contacted the hotel in advance to request a refurbished room and the request was kindly added to my reservation. We arrived around 4pm and was told our room wasn’t quite ready but to take a seat in the lobby and have a drink on them. We ordered a glass of  Prosecco each and by the time the drinks arrived a member of staff told us our room was ready. We stayed on floor 4 and our room was facing the road but the road noise didn’t bother us. The room was modern and nicely styled, and had everything we needed; mini fridge, bottled water, iron and ironing board, toiletries and even a coffee machine - although some complimentary biscuits would have been a nice touch but no biggy at all. 
Just a note, the rooms don’t have air con and we went the end of May which was quite warm and the rooms were a bit stuffy so could be an issue in the summer, however, fans are provided. 
We made use of the pool one morning which was lovely and clean (a little dated but I can imagine that will take some refurbishment).
All in all a great stay in a great location with everything in walking distance.",5,2023,05,30
248,Ideal city hotel,We really enjoyed our days here. The staff are so helpful and professional. The twin room was ideal  and very clean. There are lots of restaurants nearby. We eventually worked out the tram stops. Iveigh Park is nearby and it leads through to the Museum of literature and is super coffee shop.,5,2023,05,29
248,Fantastic massage!,"I have been multiple times at this salon and I always book Diana. 
Diana is a very talented therapist. I had the traditional thai massage and the deep tissue massage with her and she is fantastic! 

The salon is inside the Camden Court hotel located near the Spa area. There are only 2 massage rooms that are small, clean and cost. 

I am looking forward to my next appointment! ",5,2023,05,21
248,Exceptional service that turned an unfortunate incident around,"Rebecca and the operations manager were phenominal.  They displayed excellent customer service.  The hotel was very clean and the breakfast was great.  Thank you both for taking responsibilty for the bad taxi service, when it really was out of your control. ",5,2023,05,18
248,Somewhat comfortable.,"The noise street was a really down. Also the electrical configuration for the room was outdated. And let’s not talk about the room safe at ground level. For a 66+ not too safe,  the lobby and restaurant are nicely decorated and comfortable.  Staff, very friendly.",4,2023,05,15

248,Nice clean hotel,Nice clean hotel.  Room was warm.  Restaurant on premises for sit down dinner and buffet breakfast.  Free wifi.  Elevators are a little slow.  Staff was very helpful.  We arrived with damaged luggage and needed to buy replacement before next journey segment.  Staff directions were spot on.,4,2023,05,09

Breakfast was very good, hot & cold buffet , plenty of staff on hand. 

We have stayed here individually and as a couple on numerous occasions Overall super hotel, great location, reasonably priced, clean with good food and always welcoming staff.",5,2023,05,06
248,Clover Thai Massage,"Went to Clover Thai Massage with 3 friends for full body massages. The ladies were so lovely and friendly. The massage was an hour long. The ambience in the room was relaxing and the massage was amazing, one of the best I've ever had. The lady I had really worked out some tough knots I had but made sure I was completely soothed and relaxed by the end. I floated out the door afterwards!",5,2023,04,26
248,Busniess trip!,"Stayed at the Camden Court Hotel for a Busniess trip for 1 night as I have meetings in Dublin tomorrow morning! The staff in this hotel go above and beyond for you! Especially the Duty Manager Chloe she went above and beyond for me and I cannot thank her enough. She also gave me her Busniess card which I will be passing onto my company & friends to stay in this hotel even though I wasn’t staying as a leisure guest I was looked after by all
Staff members extremely well. I will be back and I will also be spreading the good word! ",5,2023,04,18
248,Wholly satisfyingly stay,"A hotel in a great location close to Grafton Street and an ideal base for exploring the city.

Check in was quick and easy, rooms were spacious and clean and breakfast was terrific

We ate once at the bar and no complaints there either

There was one night we ordered close to 10pm and although it was our through by staff it didn’t reach kitchen and result was no food

However the staff sprang to action with cakes, nuts, crisps, and the manager even offered to go into the kitchen and make us a sandwich, remarkable customer service

Stayed in the Gresham, Westin and this hotel beats them hands down for customer service, no doubt about it.",4,2023,04,16
248,Fantastic stay,Brilliant stay this hotel is not far from city centre just a short walk.spacious rooms very clean beds were comfy we stayed in a family room. Staff were very friendly. We loved the bar plenty of screens showing sports. Thanks we look forward to staying with you again in the the future 😃,4,2023,04,13
248,Love this hotel ,"Visited this hotel for a girls trip away. There is a bus stand at Dublin airport and we asked directions to Camden court, got shown to a bus to Camden court by an incredibly helpful man. Bus cost 8 euros each and was around 30 minutes to get there. The hotel is opposite a Wetherspoons and next door is a lovely bar. There was no noise at night and had a restful sleep. There are plenty of shops nearby the hotel and it’s around 20 minutes walk to temple bar area and the main shopping centre. The hotel was clean and nicely decorated. All of the staff from the reception staff, bar staff, swimming pool reception and cleaners were so friendly and helpful. One lovely man from reception even took us to our bus stop to get to the airport home. Thank you again! The rooms were nice and comfortable and the breakfast very nice too. Take plenty of euros for your visit to Dublin as it is very expensive. ",5,2023,03,28
248,I would definitely recommend!,"Fantastic stay. Lovely designed hotel with a gorgeous pool area, including a shallow pool for babies and toddlers. Very comfortable, cosy and clean, with friendly staff. It was also very close to the town centre, Dublin castle and St Patrick's Cathedral. The only issue we had was that the restaurant at the hotel was very overpriced, with average food (over 100 euros for 2 adults and a toddler), but the staff in the restaurant were lovely, welcoming and very polite. It was also very close to a lot of shops and restaurants on the same street (for example, Tesco was less than a 2 minutes walk)",5,2023,03,25
248,AMAZING HOTEL,Myself and partner came over for our belated honeymoon to explore Dublin. Camdon Hotel is one of the best hotels Iv ever stayed in and Iv been to some very expensive popular ones in the UK but this one ticks all the boxes from friendliness to cleaness ! You have all the equipment In your room and hotel you need and the spa is a great bonus !! The food it's just to die for and the service is amazing. Felt like a first class customer all along for our 5 days . Definitely will be revisiting and booking this hotel again. Thanks for our stay :) ,5,2023,03,24
248,Great hotel ,"We stayed here 20/3/23 -24/3/23 

The 4 nights we stayed were superb, right from check in until check out! The staff all really friendly, polite. The rooms were amazing, as well as the whole hotel from top to bottom, great location and highly recommend to anyone who is looking for a really good hotel in Dublin. Will definitely be coming back to stay at the hotel",5,2023,03,24
248,Bed for the night!,"Busy hotel. Noisy at night, heard a lot of commotion on the corridor. Fire alarm went off during the night. Expensive for what it is on a room only basis, typical for Dublin at the moment though unfortunately! Bedroom warm and a lot of street noise when windows open.",3,2023,03,20
248,"Excellent hotel, great staff and good breakfasts","Stayed at Camden Court for 3 nights whilst on a cultural visit with friends. We all had refurbished rooms which were excellent. Spotlessly clean and kept that way by daily housekeeping. Reception/lounge area a nice place to enjoy a drink and chat.
All staff were very pleasant and a slight problem with the bill was efficiently resolved with a refund and apology.
The breakfasts were lovely, good quality and friendly chefs. Slight delays in getting tea sometimes as you need to catch the attention of a staff member who were busy clearing tables but this did spoil a good experience.
One of our group used the gym daily and rated it excellent.
Looking forward to my return trip to the Camden Court in May for the Heineken Rugby finals weekend.",5,2023,03,14
248,Pool & Gym,The pool and Gym area at the hotel is very good and the staff that work there are very friendly i met a girl called Chloe who was very kind and offered us coffee. I got a massage and oh my lord it was incredible.,5,2023,03,12
248,Chloe Manager,"Lets Begin

From check in to check out was amazing.

We were greeted by Chloe when we arrived and it is true what the reviews says about this amazing young woman my sister stays in the Camden court hotel very often and my sister gifted me this hotel stay. Chloe went above and beyond for us. Is there anything this lady cant do? she checked us in she was also in the bar/ lobby looking after guests she also helped putting our electric car on charge which is an extra bonus for this hotel .She was also in the pool area and showed us around. I will be returning thank you to also the staff at the breakfast it was very nice.",5,2023,03,12
248,Incredible…so thankful!,"This hotel went absolutely above and beyond to make sure that we had a comfortable stay. We had a family emergency in the days leading up to our travel date, so we reached out to them to allow just a little more time on our cancellation, not expecting any bend as policies can be strict. This hotel were so sympathetic and accommodating and allowed us extra time so we weren’t in a position having to rush into a decision. 
Thankfully we could travel so not only had they been so amazing with the cancellation policy, once we notified we would be coming, they upgraded our room so we were more comfortable whilst there.
We can’t thank them enough for what they did for us. What an incredible place that puts peoples emotions and feelings before their own policies. Would book here again in a heartbeat if we were to travel to Dublin.
The room was absolutely gorgeous. So clean, beautifully presented, bed was very comfortable, location was great. Could not fault a single thing!
Thank you so much again!",5,2023,03,08
248,Lovely hotel,"Lovely hotel with easy checkin
 Excellent location. Bedroom very clean. Nice warm pool and jacuzzi at 39degrees which was brilliant! Pool area nice and warm! Staff very pleasant and helpful. We will be back",5,2023,03,03
248,Beautiful hotel. Lovely staff,"Stayed at the hotel- beautiful room, amazing location. Was given an upgrade for breakfast and also a card and chocolates left in room for boyfriend’s birthday. Staff couldn’t do any more to help, and were great all around. Hotel room was gorgeous and very spacious. Had a massage which was very good- and all staff were knowledgeable on recommendations. Would definitely recommend",5,2023,02,26
248,3 star at best,"From reading all the lovely reviews written about Camden Court, it is disappointing that we didn’t have the same experience and also makes me wonder did we even stay at the same hotel?!

From looking at pictures it is clear that the hotel has undergone refurbishment of some rooms, although we did not stay in one of these and it was not made clear to us that the price we paid was not for a one the newly refurbished rooms. I booked our stay based on these new pictures, so to arrive and not have on of these rooms was disappointing so say the least. The room we had was dark and very worn - there were marks all over the walls, the laminate was peeling in the bathroom and the tap had become detached from the basin, making it hard to use.

The amenities in the room were very basic, although we did enjoy the large smart TV and the bed was very comfortable. The bed, although advertised to us as a king, was actually two beds pushed together. 

The leisure centre was tired and shabby, not how it looked in the pictures at all and I would even go as far as to say the changing rooms were dirty - we spent as little time in there as possible.

Customer  service also left something to be desired - we dropped our bags at reception in the morning before checking in at 4pm, and upon asking for our bags were actually asked to go behind the reception and find them ourselves!! Not the level of customer service I would expect from a 4 star hotel.

Overall, a disappointing experience, made up for only by the great location and proximity to Temple Bar.",3,2023,02,22
248,Very nice hotel,"Very nice hotel. Good facilities, breakfast very tasty. Modern bathroom and bedroom with a walk in shower and ring light mirror. Can’t think of any faults. The gym is a bit small and cramped but we only used it once so doesn’t matter. Great location only 20 min walk from Temple Bar area. Would stay again. Only negative is the late check in time of 4pm, but they hold your bags so you can go out and explore the local area.",4,2023,02,15
248,Excellent Thai Massage,Clover Thai Massage is located beside the leisure centre. I had a really excellent massage here. The therapist located all my aches and knots and expertly massaged them away. I would highly recommend this place. If you are staying in the Camden Court treat yourself to a massage.,5,2023,02,13
248,Amazing,"We have stayed in CC many, many times and we keep coming back for more. We love it, we have two young children and the staff go above and beyond. I can't speak highly enough of Chloe, Chloe McGrath. She is so so friendly, kind and gives  the best advice and info about Dublin. We will see you all again very soon I hope!! 🤩😀😁",5,2023,02,07
248,Thank you,"Many thanks to everyone at the Camden Court hotel for your hospitality over the last few days. You were very understanding and nothing was too much to ask you. 
We will certainly return when in Dublin again.",5,2023,02,06
248,Weekend in Dublin ,"Lovely hotel in a great location,Camden Street is full of bars and restaurants.The hotel had friendly staff and the room was great with comfortable bed and on the smart TV you can log in to Netflix and watch a movie.

Rooms are really lovely and very comfortable .  Breakfast was delicious and our friends also used the pool, which they were delighted with. Staff were excellent, so friendly and helpful. Highly recommend this fabulous hotel and we look forward to returning.",5,2023,01,17
248,Back Again - And For Good Reason (s) - including Solid Pool and Amazing Massage,"I hadn't been in Dublin for a while but stuck to the Camden for my 2 day business visit and it delivered in all aspects once again. I looked over my review in 2017 when I noted an excellent rehab and guess what - they are at it again. This time the lobby has been brightened and a lot of color added which sparkles up the place a bit in the new 'Paris ' style of decorating, which is fine. They are also doing a rolling renovation of all the floors, common to hotels, and in a really professional way even with more style than when I last stayed here for a considerable length of time. The renovated rooms have fresh muted carpets, excellent beds and linens, very spacious bathrooms and closets and sitting and work spaces which are essential for business travelers and good desk chairs with all the plugs, wifi and etc which  you need. Also the TV has connection you can log into your own Netflix and Prime. The hotel also has a great health spa with gym and pool long enough for laps with a solid sauna and steam room and frankly in the same club the best darn Thai massage I have EVER had from Ann at Clover Thai Massage in the club itself, who knows her stuff and how to uncrack a really bad set of tight back and hip muscles undoubtedly from road warrior stress. - she's a complete professional and brilliant. Covid offed some of the very good restos nearby unfortunately it seems,  but new ones are cropping up if you want low end high end try the first Persian you come to caddy corner across the road and try the veggie wrap which is actually a veggie pizza - astonishingly fresh perfectly cooked and outstanding. You have also Grafton Street in walking distance and right near the heart of the business community - a great deal in a short walking distance ; also with easy airport connections. Special nods to Chloe McGrath and Pablo at the front desk who were extremely helpful in finding a quiet room for this weary traveler. You may want to call in advance to make sure you get a room away  from where some renovations are taking place- the work doesn't interrupt the hotel but if that's an issue, they should be able to sort you as they did me. All in all perfect location for an extended Dublin visit - solid as the big building itself in all ways and it manages to serve both a significant number of guests AND business clients seeking quality and amenities at the same time. As they say in New York - what's not to like ? Enjoy.",5,2023,01,10
248,Chloe’s a superstar,"Fantastic experience from check in to check out, we were greeted with gifts from the lovely manager Chloe who couldn’t do enough for us, she went above and beyond to make our stay special! She booked transport for us, chatted to the kids, she’s a very special lady. The entire staff were lovely! Excellent food, amazing spa, we can’t wait to stay again!!!",5,2023,01,09

248,Best Thai Massage,I had an amazing Thai Massage with Ann who is located downstairs in the Camden Court Hotel. I couldn’t recommend Ann enough - she was excellent! 10/10 experience! I have never felt such relief from back pain like I did after this massage,5,2022,12,14
248,Excellent massage,Staff excellent. Great location. The Traditional Thai massage down stairs with Ann was excellent. One of the best massage I've ever had. Highly recommended to anyone that wants t to unwind and finish with a sauna and steamroom ,5,2022,12,05
248,Good would recommend,Lovely hotel nice room’s friendly staff great modern decor. Central to lots of places. Very nice food including breakfast and coffee. Would stay here again. They supply umbrellas and look after your bag’s safety if you check in or out early. The hotel had a nice feel about it decorated lovely for Christmas,5,2022,12,05
248,Great night staff!,"Stayed in this hotel in September with a group of friends as we were going to a musical in the bord gais. When we arrived back to the hotel after dancing our socks off (making the most of our night away!) we were met by fantastic staff at the door. The night manager Eoin was so accommodating and very professional. He has super customer service skills and is an asset to the hotel. Would stay again purely based on the warm welcome from Eoin, to both myself and my friends. ",5,2022,12,04
248,Not great,"Average experience. Rooms are comfy but small. Bathrooms need some upgrade. Very noisy. Breakfast like in any other chain hotel - quite limited options to chose from. Leisure area - outdated and a bit dirty. Check in experience -very poor. After arriving quite early the receptionist told us that check in at 4, when we tried to ask for some options (like extra paid breakfast, use of hotel pool, etc) she didn’t seem to care giving any advice and just said “see you at 4”. I mean it’s obvious that there are rules in the hotel but a little care like “you can try out restaurant or chill in the lobby, bla bla” would be nice gesture. We felt not welcome in the hotel until the official check in time.",3,2022,12,04
248,Clover Thai Massage amazing,"Stayed in the Camden Court Hotel in December.  It's a lovely hotel. I got a hot stone massage in Clover Thsi massage at hotel. It was amazing, I highly recommend. Very relaxing and authentic experience 😌 ",5,2022,12,03

248,Lovely Staff but very noisy,"Staff were lovely, very helpful. However, the room we were in overlooked the courtyard and even though we were on the 3rd floor the noise outside in the early hours kept me awake until nearly 2am. I did mention this to the staff when checking out and they apologised but it was too late at that point. While the choice for breakfast was very good, some areas need improvement - my scrambled eggs were cold and the rashers/bacon were not nice. We were in a rush off so I didn't get to speak to anyone about it. I feel that a few things let the hotel down and that they should let people know that on a Saturday night that side of the hotel might be noisy - or invest in some soundproof windows.",3,2022,11,28
248,High recommend to stay in Dublin,If you want somewhere in Dublin  to stay I highly recommend this hotel they have a professional service all of stuff are great of them job very good selection of breakfast  and in the hotel you will fine everything you want in Leisure Centre you will enjoy swimming pool gym stream room and sauna and you can treat yourself with a great message you must try .

ALL the staff were very professional and couldn't do enough for you, which was very much appreciated. We could both see how hard working they all were and being on our honeymoon we appreciated how special they made us feel. Also for the price of our stay it was  exceptional value for money and wouldn't hesitate to return to this hotel when next in  Dublin.",5,2022,10,27
248,Beware of strangers entering your room while you sleep,"We stayed in Camden Court hotel on Wednesday 12 October 2022. We had booked a night away as we really wanted a relaxing night away with a lie in and nice breakfast. However, we were awakened at 6.44 a.m. by someone actually coming into our room. Obviously that was our chance of a lie in disturbed...you do not expect to wake up to see a stranger in your room! To say it spoiled our trip is an understatement. We reported this at the reception desk and were told they would look into it but still have heard nothing from the hotel (we sort of expected at least an apology from a manager).",1,2022,10,26
248,Dining in the reception area!,"After a long hards day work I went to the camden court hotel after work while I was waiting for the rain to stop I had a club sandwich and it just hit the spot!
I got talking to a lovely young woman called Chloe who works in the hotel! She was very chatty and very kind! This is just what you except from a 4 star hotel and the gentleman  who served me unfortunately I didn’t get his name he was also very kind and chatty I will be passing on the good reviews to my colleagues in the office so we can pop around here for lunch sometime!",5,2022,10,04
248,Visit,I stayed at the camden court hotel on the 1st of October are meal the right we stayed was amazing! We made full use of the leisure centre & then went for breakfast we’re we met the duty manger Chloe we were greeted by her as she showed us to a table in the breakfast area and fully explained how the buffet breakfast worked all I have to say is credit is due to this young lady her manners and kindness is out of this world I will definitely return to this property without a doubt the service is just outgoing.,5,2022,10,02

The leisure centre is amazing and has everything you need",5,2022,10,01
248,Great Place to Stay,Very accomadating staff and the restaurant was fantastic! Got there at 11 am which is way before check in time. Girl at the desk came and found us in the lobby after she got us an early check in. Went to restaurant in motel and the lamb cut like butter and was sooo good. Monk fish tasted like lobster and was wonderful. Well worth it!,5,2022,09,26
248,Great lunch - try the goats cheese salad - Wow !!,"We flew into Dublin T1, arriving 12:30 and caught the 784 bus - the stop is literally outside the terminal. A quick and efficent journey straight to Charlotte Way, across the road and into Camden Court for lunch. The hotel staff were friendly, but what really blew us away was the goats cheese salad ..... WOW...   sadly we didn't stay at the hotel, but instead caught a 5 minute cab ride to our hotel...",5,2022,09,26
248,Clean and close to attractions,"I wouldn't want to drive here.  It doesn't seem to have much parking.  I am amazed at how the buses are able to back into this hotel space.  The entrance to the hotel is hidden away.

Rooms are clean.  FYI.  unless you put the sign out to ""clean your room"", they will not come in.  We found that out the hard way.

Their maps of the city are okay.  The maps give you names of the big roads so you still have to do a bit of guessing of where you want to go.

Food here is okay.  It's not something that I would write home about.

It is relatively quiet",4,2022,09,24
248,Disappointed,"The amenities were  good. Though some of the staff, including the manager, were not willing to assist us when we had difficulties with the booking company  they set us up with. They knew we were on a time limit and didn't seem to care that we were not going make it to the tour meeting site in time.",2,2022,09,21
248,Disappointed,"Although the accommodations were perfectly fine, the apathy of some staff and the manager was very disappointing.When we requested transportation for a prepaid trip well in advance and it never showed they simply didn’t care and we were told to to try and flag a taxi. Suffice to say we won’t be back .",2,2022,09,20
248,CX enjoyed Retreat at Camden Court Hotel,"We could recommend Camden Court Hotel, the service is perfect and very friendly, The bedrooms are very comfortable, the meeting room was perfect for us (13 people). The food at Iveagh Restaurant was great. Nice Lobby and bar. Small Sauna (fits for 3 people) but a very big indoor pool for a hotel.",5,2022,09,20
248,Ticks all the boxes,"Once again, another enjoyable experience here. This hotel ticks all the boxes. Great location, reasonably priced , a little on the high side if i’m honest, never the less, a fine hotel with great facilities and pleasant staff. Always love visiting 👍",5,2022,09,17
248,Excellent Location - Comfortable Rooms,"We stayed at the Camden Court in Dublin for two nights. The hotel is in a very good location with many restaurants and bars within walking distance. There is an onsite restaurant with bar and also a pub right directly in front of the hotel (essentially attached to the building).

Our room was comfortable, the bed and linen were of good quality. The washroom was a good size with modern fixtures and large showers. The room had a fridge which was helpful along with a fan that sat on the desk.

The hotel had a very nice breakfast included with many choices available. Also had a pool and sauna.

The staff were really helpful and accommodating - always checking with us and assisting in any way possible.

Would recommend this property as an excellent place to stay and reasonably priced for Dublin standards.",5,2022,09,15
248,Great location,This is a hotel that is in a good location. It is a little loud at night only because there is no air conditioning and you need to keep the windows open . This is only because Ireland is so hot this year. Other than that this was a great place to stay. Easy walk to everything.,4,2022,09,11
248,Wonderful staff and an excellent restaurant,"This review applies to the restaurant only. The staff were exceptionally friendly and were very accommodating to us when asking if dining outside in the courtyard area was possible (even when the weather was not ideal). The food from the brunch and lunch menus was delicious and arrived very promptly. We continued to order items for several hours with the staff always being very helpful. Particular kudos to Gerard for being so flexible on the day. I would highly recommend visiting here for the service, the excellent food and keen value. Many thanks.",5,2022,09,04
248,"Lovely, clean hotel, great location","We stayed here for two nights and have no complaints at all. Very welcoming. Bedroom was clean, bed very comfortable, had everything we needed there. No noise and we had a good sleep. Lobby area was grand and a great place to relax with a drink. Breakfast was nice and plenty of choice. Nice pubs and restaurants in the area, e.g Bleeding Horse, The Porthouse Cava and lots of other places that we didn’t get a chance to try.",5,2022,08,28

248,Did us fine,"Visited for one night with my daughter.
Twin room was clean.

248,Best Hotel- super staff,"My husband daughter and I stayed on Sunday 7th August. The room was perfect- great size, clean and comfortable. Breakfast was excellent.

248,Nice Accommodations,"Checked in at Camden Court. Large room with a queen bed and nice linens. Large work desk with sufficient outlets and a table lamp. In-room safe, small refrigerator, coffee  and tea pot. Only one luggage rack and that was built-in and only wide
enough for a carry-on bag. Had to set the second bag on the round table. The bathroom was very large with a long shelf behind the commode for toiletries. Walk-in shower. The room was a little stuffy so we opened the window to let in some fresh air. Breakfast was included with our room. Large selection of food to select from. Coffee could have been better.",4,2022,08,01
248,Weekend trip away,"Myself and my boyfriend came here for a weekend away and I have to say I was very impressed by the service provided.

When we went for a drink at the bar, the lovely bar lady Trish made us some nice drinks and had a great laugh. Overall great experience, very impressed with the customer service.",5,2022,07,17
248,Dirty showe,"OK ish !
Our room comfortable even though our outlook was dull..bathroom was dated..no walkin shower as I was expecting from this hotel..
Staff on reception pleasant and helpful.
My biggest complaint was the leasure centre...dirty dirty dirty !
I complained to pool attendant about shower area..blocked drains with long hair floating about..water not draining away..dirty tiles..
I was told that many people had made the same complaint. 
After 24 hrs I expected them to have been cleaned but no..still dirty !
I made a complaint to reception but doubt anything has changed!
I chose this hotel for its pool & jacuzzi..left feeling very dissapointed!",2,2022,07,13

248,Good location and clean room,"Went to here with friends, nice location a very busy street in the city center on the weekend.

248,Pre concert meal,"Popped in for a meal before a concert at the nearby Iveagh gardens.  Restaurant not open so we dined in the lobby.  My partner had burger and chips and I had fish and chips.  Both were very tasty and service was ok , if not a bit slow . We were not asked if we were happy.  Ordered a coffee that didn't arrive and was ordered again . Hence the 4 out of 5.",4,2022,07,07
248,Construction Noise without Warning,"My mom and I landed at Dublin airport early on Tuesday morning and immediately went to the Camden Court hotel. We arrived at the hotel at about 10:30 AM and checked in. During check in, there was no mention of construction happening on the 5th floor of the hotel and we were placed in a room directly beneath the construction. We did not know about the construction until we heard drilling above us. I called to ask  if there was construction going on in the hotel and was told by the front desk for the first time that yes, there was but it wasn’t supposed to bother anyone because check in is at 4 and we checked in “too early.” During this conversation, I was told that the construction would be over at 3:00 p.m. My mom and I had been traveling for over 24 hours at this point and needed to sleep. My mom was not able to sleep in the next four hours that we were in that room. The noise was unbearable. My mom called the front desk again and complained about the noise. When she asked if the construction would be ongoing, the front desk clerk then on duty said that construction would be ongoing from 8:00-6:00 every day. My mom got very upset and said that we wanted a refund because I had prepaid for our stay and had not been informed about construction at the time I booked the Camden Court. The hotel manager came to our room and brought us to a room on the third floor away from the construction. He told us that they don’t tell the hotel guests about the construction because 90% of guests are not affected. He also kept mentioning that we had “checked in early.” However,  he did admit that the room we were in originally was directly beneath the construction. As stated above, they also kept changing the time when the construction would end. We did switch to a room on the third floor and the manager gave us a free dinner that night and breakfast the next two mornings, which was admittedly generous. Nonetheless, the two big notes here: When we have stayed at other hotels that have had ongoing construction, we have ALWAYS been notified ahead of time and then made the choice to stay there; I made the reservation through American Express. The hotel’s reasoning of my mom and me somehow being responsible for being affected by the noise because we checked  in “too early” is not valid in my opinion because according to AMEX, as a card holder I am entitled to an early check in. Also, there was nothing preventing them from notifying us of the construction at the time we were checking in, especially as they knew they were putting us in a room they knew would be affected. Additionally , don’t blame patrons for mistakes obviously made by staff. One final note: any guests of the hotel should not request the front desk call them a cab. The wait times were 30 minutes to an hour with the hotel’s cab company. I ordered a cab through Uber and the longest I had to wait was about 20 minutes because the driver was dropping someone else off first. The other times I called a taxi through Uber the wait time was 2-7 minutes.",3,2022,07,07
248,"Good location, clean rooms","We had a two-night stay in Dublin in early June at the Camden. 

Pros: Hotel offers luggage storage if you arrive before check-in, which was very helpful. Close to many restaurants and convenience stores (even farther establishments are within a ~20 minute walk). Room was clean, quiet. Responded promptly to emails about booking.

Cons: Heater in room wasn't working properly. 

Tips: Having the hotel book you a taxi will take at least 30 minutes (as the concierge informed us), so it's best to ask them to call one for you well in advance or to pre-book on FreeNow. Could be hard to get a taxi if you are making the booking during peak times.",4,2022,07,04
248,Disgusting,"Room was vile.  Had horrendous smell, damp carpets and damp all over ceiling.  Room looked nothing like advertised. Parties going on in rooms throughout the night.  Food was disgusting and overpriced.  Renovation going on during day time.  Jumped up little duty manager called Stephen should be kept in the back rather than dealing with customers.  He is rude unprofessional and hasn't a clue to do his job.  Overall I would rather stay in my car than stay here and will never ever again step foot inside. I am a celebrity should use this hotel as a bush tucker trial to see can they make it through the night in this kip ! 
I felt I needed to be dowsed in bleach after staying here, so disgusting. AVOID",1,2022,07,01
248,Just OK!,"Hotel is spotless, pool is lovely & very central. Stayed on a Saturday and was awoken most of the night by people leaving clubs and pubs. Food is dreadful, save your money and go to some nice restaurants in Dublin. Big shout out to the manager Goron (may not have spelt this right) he was a gentleman.",3,2022,06,30
248,Disappointed,"Really disappointed, thought the hotel was lovely, really nice hotel, except for the fact that when me and my boyfriend walked in after a night out the man on the reception judged us when he saw us, he asked us our room number, we told him and he immediately said there was no one staying in that room without checking. The second he saw my boyfriends key card he got flustered, told a blatant lie and said “oh, it’s not showing up on the system” pretending he knew the list of everyone staying and letting on he thought no one was staying in our room. he was extremely rude and just presumed we weren’t good enough to be staying there. Made us feel very uncomfortable!!",3,2022,06,27
248,Dont expect much sleep,"Booked into camden hotel for sunday evening after finishing my 3rd night shift the sunday morning. Luckily I had packed ear plugs as i had to get up at 1am and put them in the hotel is that noisy and you can hear everything both outside and inside. I was woke at 8am to construction work going on hammering and drilling 2 floors above me but i was convinced they were in the room next door it was that loud, even with ear plugs in. I think people should be made aware at check in they will be woke 4 hours prior to check out by construction work. If I had of been told this I would certainly not have stayed. When I rang reception to complain all i was offered was a late check out, not sure why they thought I would want to lay and listen to the noise any longer. needless to say ill not be back",1,2022,06,27
248,Good location in city,"
In Dublin for a long weekend as we had tickets to the Duran Duran concert at St Annes Park. 

We chose this hotel for its good central location in the city, walking distance to Temple Bar and direct buslink to the airport, and found it to be clean, very comfortable and modern with friendly helpful staff. 

Couple of downsides in the room though.  

The ceiling spotlights in the bedroom, bathroom and hallway were few and far between, and being soft lighting provided dimly lit areas where it was almost impossible to see to apply makeup as the lighting created blind spots.  I'm short sighted and have to remove my specs to apply eye make up and need to be up close to the mirror to apply it. Maybe the hotel should consider installing brighter lighting at eyeline level on both sides of the hall and bathroom mirrors - maybe ask for a female opinion on the placing. I had to resort to standing on the bed to utilise the ceiling lighting above the mirror installed there.

And whoever decided it would be a good idea to hard wire the hairdryer into the desk drawer beneath the TV needs to ask themselves WHY?   Hairdryers are used to blowdry hair into a style not just for drying hair and I feel the hotel setup was totally impractical as the hairdyer could not be used near a mirror, and with the black backdrop of the wide-screen TV it was difficult to see what I was doing in the mirror on the opposite wall.

Whilst this weekend trip was a relaxed event if I had been on a business trip or going to a wedding or other celebration where appearance was more important then I would have been disappointed.  I'm not physically disabled just have a visual impairment and I don't feel the room lighting was designed for anyone other than those with 20/20 vision.

248,Nice stay at Camden Court Hotel,"Stayed at Camden Court Hotel for two nights and enjoyed my stay. There was:
-a big bed with VERY comfortable mattress and pillows 
-decent sized bathroom with a nice shower (the mini toiletries were nice too!)
-good coffee/tea making facilities 
-very friendly staff

We did not have the opportunity to try the restaurant/bar but whenever we walked passed it was busy so I’m guessing it is good!

Also to note, the bathroom tap is very powerful and did take us by surprise! 

However there were some downsides:
-the fire alarm was tested at 8.20 in the morning, which seems counterproductive considering the majority of guests would be asleep at this time and it is disruptive 
-there was construction work ongoing in the morning which was somewhat of a nuisance 
-there was a lack of mirrors with good lighting which made it difficult to get ready. The mirrors that were in the room were in a weird position (one was directly behind the bed)

Regardless, I still enjoyed my stay here, would recommend and I would definitely consider staying here if I ever get the joy to visit Dublin again!",5,2022,06,23
248,Don't ask for a sandwich!,"This hotel looks very swish and the rooms are great. However my experience when I wanted a snack was unbelievable.  I looked at the menu but everything was too heavy. I asked the waitress for a simple cheese and onion sandwich.  Her response was ""the chef won't understand "". She tried to persuade me to have a ham and cheese toastie off the menu. I didn't want ham! She went away and came back saying I could have an open sandwich which I said was fine. Then I waited and waited. Over the next 40 minutes I asked three different waiters/waitresses where my sandwich was. Each time they'd go off to the kitchen then come back and apologise. Eventually a sandwich arrived. It was made using those awful orange cheese slices you see on burgers. It looked vile and tasted awful. To add insult to injury, I'd asked for a gin and tonic which didn't arrive. I asked the waitress about it when she was collecting glasses and she said ""oh I forgot, I'll do it when I've finished this"". Getting good staff with some common sense seems to be a major issue.",3,2022,06,21
248,Very Relaxing,"Great hotel in very handy location. Easy transport links, very near a great selection of bars, pubs and eateries. Good selection for breakfast. Staff were all helpful. The room was nice (it's on a main road so expect traffic noise and peaple walking past) the bed was massive and room was epuiped with huge smart TV. Bathroom was clean and everything worked. Would I stay again? Yes!!!",5,2022,06,10
248,VERY NOISY,"The walls are paper thin, very loud patrons in the hallway during the night.  The doors close with a bang.  I wear ear plugs while sleepng. They aren't helpful at this place for a quiet night's sleep.   The room is overheated.  Polyester comforters without a top sheet make it impossible to sleep at a comfortable temperature.  The man running the breakfast was rude and abrupt.  Instead of waiting for the question to be spoken and he just talks over you to tell you what he wants to say and clearly does NOT care what your question is as his news has NOTHING to do with your question.  Food is medicare.   The room has a hair dryer which is hard wired in a desk drawer without a mirror??? Very limited storage space in the bathroom. Hot water is scalding hot.",3,2022,06,10
248,Great stay,The staff at the hotel are so friendly and helpful . The rooms are very clean and comfortable. We had lunch in the restaurant and it was good value for money. Good central location would definitely recommend this hotel and hope to return in the future,5,2022,06,07
248,"Amazing hotel at a decent price, defo worth a visit!","Stayed here for my special special birthday and it did not disappoint! 
Fabulous hotel! 
Close to all the places you want to be but a short walk away so away from the huddle and bustle of Dublin’s famous temple bar! Defo clears the cobwebs and the hangover the morning after. Would Absolutely stay here again! We have been going to Dublin for the last 15 years and like to try new hotels, to mix it up a bit. 
Food gorgeous! 
Super clean and comfortable 
Bed comfortable 
Staff fabulous
Great value for money! Cheaper than our flights! 
Amazing",5,2022,06,05
248,Would be 5 stars if they cleaned up the leisure centre,"Lovely stay at Camden court, we was in Dublin for a short break. It’s about 20 minute walk to temple bar but the hotel was surrounded by various bars if you wanted something more low key. Breakfast was fine, rooms were nice & big beds. I chose this hotel as we like to have a swimming pool/ spa type thing. The swimming area was lovely, definitely more of a leisure centre but we knew that and got what we paid for. However what struck me was the state of the changing rooms they were so messy and unclean it made me feel a bit gross. Apart from that perfect location, great staff, good food. Would return if back in Dublin!",4,2022,06,01
248,Home away from home!,"We were early to check in on arrival and they jumped through hoops to accommodate us!  We had a giant van and had a young man spend a lot of time helping us park the monster in the small parking lot.  They were just so  happy to see us, probably my fifth or sixth stay there.  Very clean and bright.  We couldn't have been happier with our rooms and the wonderful service at the desk.",5,2022,05,31
248,Dublin 2022,"We arrived early and left our bags with reception. Really nice hotel and kind staff. Some issues with the room in regards to booking in and having a nap - vaguely remember someone coming into the room, in short there had been a mix up and we’d been given a hotel room that someone else was due to have. After several phone calls, packing and un packing we were told we could remain - there seemed to be a lack of communication between the staff members but overall good experience and we’d come back.",3,2022,05,30
248,Lovely Hotel - Good Value,"Stayed here for one night for a concert in The Olympia. First off, it’s very close to The Harcourt Luas line so easy to get to without the car. Was immediately impressed with the large spacious lobby area where you can enjoy a drink or food.  We had both and had no complaints and the service was very good and efficient. Our double room had a lovely comfortable king sized bed, 40in flat screen Tv and walk in shower. It was a decent size and on the 5th floor so away from any ground noise. Again we had no complaints. I booked this on Agoda.com through Trip Advisor and considering hotel prices in Dublin City Centre that weekend were between 200-300 for some hotels, this was a steal at 143 for the room. We paid separately for breakfast which was a little expensive at 17eur each but was very good and everything in the buffet was very fresh. I always like freshly squeezed orange juice too which I got. The Bleeding Horse pub is directly underneath the Hotel and is a decent bar and Camden Street itself is full of lively bars and restaurants so it is well located also. We did not use the leisure centre or gym on this occasion. Overall though we found the hotel hard to fault. ",4,2022,05,22
248,Our recent trip to Dublin with two stays at the Camden Court Hotel,"We recently stayed twice at the Camden Court Hotel in Dublin. The entire staff were a pleasure. We had three lovely meals in the restaurant with outstanding service by Isabel! Please express our appreciation to her! She was very patient with our group and was prompt with her service. If you are a light sleeper, I would ask for a room that is not on the street side of the hotel, there is a lot of traffic and noise from the street below. This hotel is very conveniently located to business and shopping on Grafton Street.",5,2022,05,21
248,"Great location, Lovely Staff","We enjoyed a 3 day stay at Camden Court Hotel.  The hotel is welcoming, with spacious, open lobby area to enjoy a drink and conversation.  The Reception Staff were all  so very helpful and kind with questions and guidance we needed.  All were upbeat and pleasure to deal with.  Extra thank you to Stella and her kind  help when we needed! We loved the location of the hotel and enjoyed many nearby walkable neighborhoods and sights to see: Dublin Castle; The Christ Cathedral; Grafton ST.; St. Stephens park;Trinity College; Temple bar area- all wonderful to walk to.",4,2022,05,20
248,"Nice hotel, very good for short stay","We liked the room and breakfast. Pool area was not realy clean at 7 pm and the same can be said for the reception area and lobby bar.
Location is perfect, just 5 mins on foot to Grafton Street and St Stephens park. Price is oretty high, but given the location and other hotels' prices, it is good value for money.",4,2022,05,19
248,The Iveagh Resturant - Camden Court 🏨,"Went to Iveagh Resturant, very accommodating for Gluten Free and before we ordered our dinner, the waiter provided GF bread to snack on while my husband had Brown bread, its the little things,I had a steak dinner and it was fab, with a GF sauce. ",4,2022,05,19
248,Second time here and wonderful support from staff,"I love the Camden Court and am here for the second time on a trip to Dublin. Clean, comfortable, friendly and helpful staff in spite of being so busy. I want to give a shout out to Stella at the front desk, who went above and beyond in her kindness to my friend and I when we had to extend our stay in Dublin. Thank you, thank you, thank you!",5,2022,05,16
248,"Lovely hotel, great location & immaculate","Hotel is a perfect location for many of the tourist things in Dublin. Around 15 minutes from the airport. We got the bus to the hotel on our first day (Bus 700) - €8 per person. It took around 35/40 minutes and stopped a 5 minute walk away from the hotel. 
The hotel, room and facilities are immaculate. Our room was cleaned daily. We used the pool/spa facilities every day too.
The hotel is in a great location for pubs/bars and is around 15 minute walk to Temple Bar. We also walked to the Guiness Brewery which was around 25 minutes.
Due to an early flight we pre-booked a taxi to the airport which reception organised. It was there early and cost €28.80 at 4am",5,2022,05,09
248,Wellness and spa - amazing service,"Great location, near the St. Green Park and the city center. 

The hotel has a great wellness area, great size pool (16m), a jacuzzi, a sauna, and a steam room. 

Manager Robert Haugh went above and beyond to help me with my request.",5,2022,05,02
248,Has Went Downhill ,"Booked the Camden Court Hotel for a 2 night stay as we had stayed here pre covid and thought it was a good hotel.

I booked about 8months ago and asked when booking to give us a nice room as we were celebrating our anniversary, On arrival the guy checking us in was nice, I asked in a jokey way "" Where u putting us in a nice room"" to which he replied ""of course "" so I as delighted.

Well I am sorry but u must of put us in the smallest room u had, u literally could not walk past each other in the room!!!!!!! Very disappointing!!!!!

We couldn't wait to get out of it, we headed out for a few drinks on the sat night and decided to come back to hotel  early and have a drink at the lobby and we were met by a very rude guy named Eoin. Defintely not an asset to the hotel, extremely bad attitude.

Overall I felt the hotel has got grubby, not a happy camper and came home really disappointed and would not return. 
",2,2022,04,27
248,Great 3 night stay,"Stayed for 3 nights over the course of a long weekend. Had tickets to go see a show at the 3arena with our Dublin friends.
Hotel was clean, comfortable and the room was incredibly spacious. 

Modern rooms all well equipped and very clean. 
Location was perfect as was central to everything (anything too far away you could take the tram) 

Good selection of drinks at the bar. 

Breakfasts was great with a varied choice and catered for everyone. 

Took a visit to the hotel spa ( you need to pre-book) 
Looked a little dated but was clean and had everything you could need (gym, pool, steam room. Sauna, jacuzzi) 

All staff were incredibly helpful and friendly. They even looked after our bags after our checkout ( we had 4 hours to kill before our coach to the airport) 

Overall had an incredibly lovely stay and will definitely be back the next time we are in Dublin.

Thanks to all who work there",5,2022,04,25
248,Noise levels unacceptable,We stayed for 4 nights over the Easter weekend and will definitely not stay there again as every night the noise from party goers was ridiculous.  For the first 3 nights it was until 3am and on the Sunday it was 6.30am before we could get some sleep. Not acceptable for what we paid,1,2022,04,19
248,Do not book this hotel if you would like a good night's sleep,"Hotel has a courtyard and booked a party until 3am which was so noisey my
Wife and I got little sleep. The courtyard faces the front of the hotel and noise can
Be heard on all floors with rooms facing this courtyard.",1,2022,04,17
248,Family Camden Court,"From the first moment great welcome and great hospitality the whole time. Family room slept the 6 of us in comfort. The chef greeted us at breakfast like we were family. We had 2 lovely meals the both evenings we ate in the hotel, portions. We enjoyed the swimming facilities. Highly recommend.",5,2022,04,15
248,"Nice for an April stay, looks more expensive than it is!","I booked our trip, and this hotel was the one recommended by my travel company as the best value. When we walked in the door, my husband asked me, impressed, ""HOW much was this hotel?"" I didn't realize The Iveagh restaurant was literally inside the hotel (I'd had it on my list of well-reviewed dining options nearby). Breakfast was too pricey for us, but I was bummed to see the breakfast cafes across the street were not yet open at 9 a.m. (seriously??? Not the hotel's fault, of course), but it was only a few blocks until we found The Ebb and Flow, which was not much cheaper than The Iveagh in the end but had a better range for a la carte versus the flat fee back at the hotel. The rooms are VERY large for Europe. No refrigerator (con) nor air conditioning (it was freezing outside so we never needed that!), but well appointed rooms otherwise. Huge TVs with digital cable. Helpful staff. Convenient location.",5,2022,04,07
248,No Air Conditioning,"No air conditioning in rooms made for a sweltering nights sleep even in March. Completely unacceptable really. 

Also the pillows were to hard and uncomfortable. 

On the plus side it's well located and reasonable value. But the air con for me is a deal breaker and I wouldn't stay again.",2,2022,03,28
248,Lovey place to stay,"We visited here on Valentines weekend and it was lovely, really nice hotel with plenty of facilities and the staff were extremely helpful.

We had an excellent meal in the main restaurant and the breakfast buffet is amazing too with plenty to choose from. 

Really great visit and will be back.",5,2022,03,20
248,Perfect stay .,"We stayed here on st. Patrick's night of course Dublin was crazy busy this day and so was the hotel but that did not stop them been ever so professional and welcoming to us as we checked in . We arrived before midday and didn't expect to have the room ready just yet we just wanted to drop our bags but to our surprise the room was ready and we could check in early it was fantastic , the room was beautifully designed with modern bedding and various options on the television for Netflix YouTube etc, the bed was extremely comfortable. Breakfast was absaloutley devine and the staff couldn't be more attentive. The swimming pool was my toddlers favourite . Thank you for a lovely stay we can't wait to come back . Also this hotel is very central and in walking distance to shops and restaurants in the city.",5,2022,03,19
248,Made feel very unwelcome in the morning,"Hotel is very nice and the reception staff are lovely, but from 9:20am the cleaning staff kept knocking on the door and calling into the room asking us when we were leaving. I was worried check out was at 10am because they were knocking so much so I checked online and it said 12. I could hear them in the hall grilling other guests on if they were leaving as well. It was the day after paddy’s day first thing in the morning and it felt like we were all getting booted out. At one point they knocked again and when we called out asking what they wanted they said “oh. You’re still here?!” Wouldn’t touch the Camden court hotel again, not if that’s the reception you’re going to get as a paying guest first thing in the morning.",2,2022,03,18
248,Overall good but with something which could be improve,It was a very good stay. Good clean room and helpful staff. Negatives were room wasn't made up despite having my care on the door and mentioning it to a member of housekeep when I left. Wifi very poor on 2nd floor. No aircon only open window which let in loud noise.,4,2022,03,13
248,The Pub with no beer,"Visited the hotel bar last night.
Called in for a pre dinner drink and was waited on by a helpful young man called Jack.
Returned after dinner for digestives...no floor staff available.
So we went to the bar and asked for a creme de menthe and 2 brandies only to be told they had neither in stock. We also asked for Bulmers light it too was not in stock.
The barman seemed to be new to the job,the gins had no lemon or lime in them and he struggled to put our order together.
We will not be recommending this bar.
",1,2022,02,27
248,Almost great!,"Lovely hotel with very friendly staff. Check in was seamless. Had drinks in the bar and it was very comfortable woth good service. Breakfast was delicious and a great selection. Cooked breakfast was hot, fresh and very tasty.  Room was clean but there was a musty smell and we noticed a damp spot on the ceiling. Didn't let it impact our stay. Net curtains were dirty and unfortunately the windows did little to block out the noise from the revellers on Camden Street that night. Could have been an amazing stay if the room issue was addressed.",4,2022,02,25
248,"A great base to stay in Dublin, for business or pleasure. ","What a great place to stay when visiting Dublin, for pleasure or business.  Excellent accommodation and food. The main restaurant, Iveagh Restaurant has great staff who deliver the food with grrat interaction. Rooms exceptional and well decorated. Can recommend it highly for anyone looking to stay in Dublin.",5,2022,02,11
248,Short break,"Lovely room, welcoming staff, great breakfast. If you’re from the UK, pay in euros, a lot cheaper as we found out after we’d paid in pounds, we should of checked but some info from the lady at the desk would have been nice. Highly recommend here and would love to come again.",4,2022,02,11
248,All you could want and more.,"We had a wonderful overnight stay in the Camden Court Hotel. We were attending a wedding in the city centre and desperately needed to check-in to our room early, so that we could get ready, which was kindly accommodated by Stella and her team. We stayed on the 5th floor, which was recently renovated, and the rooms were lovely. Obviously we were at the wedding all day / night so we didn't see much of the hotel but we did use the leisure centre in the morning and found Robbie and his team to be very helpful and professional. What more could you ask for? 
We will return when next visiting Dublin City Centre.",5,2022,02,09
248,Luxury,"Amazing food, staff are happy and helpful, rooms were lovely. Even the little touches were nice like the Orla Keiley toiletries in the bathrooms and the Robert Welch cutlery. We will definitely stay again!",5,2022,01,30
248,Chaotic communication,The Munch and movies deal is a bit chaotic since nobody explained us how it works and we didnt get any pizza at the time we ordered because of a miscommunication. The hotel is nice and has a good restaurant. The spa was a bit busy. The communicatie could be improved,2,2022,01,28
248,Wouldn’t go back.,"The hotels location was fantastic, rooms were okay but the staff were unbelievably rude and snobby, besides one waitress called Isabel who was very friendly and helpful. There were about 15 staff in the restaurant and only Isabel acctually took and brought our orders the rest were to busy standing around. Food in restaurant was cold, slow and very limited options and incredibly overpriced for the quality.",2,2022,01,17
248,Family visit for new year bed and breakfast,"This was our second visit in 2021 for myself and my two teenage daughters and as usual the Camden court hotel  was a great choice of hotel and went the extra mile to make our stay even more enjoyable as Andjelka and her team on reception upgraded our room to a three bed family room for more comfort , the restaurant provided wonderful food and the pool and gym facilities were excellent. We will definitely be returning for another visit . Well done to all at the Camden Court Hotel.",5,2022,01,01
248,Bring sleeping pills!,"Being sleeping pills !!

The noise levels in this hotel is something else.  All night long the noise levels increased. Three times I phoned down about the unbearable noise levels, and the Porter eventually told us we could switch rooms but we must totally pack up our original room first. At 1am in  the morning, was he hoping to sell the room? This  seemed extremely unfair particularly since he said he couldn’t  guarantee the other room would be quiet either. No I do not recommend and no I will not return.",1,2021,12,01
248,Beautiful Hotel,"I stayed here with my 5 year old son because it was near an appointment and had on-site parking and an EV charger.  

The hotels location wasn’t its only asset the staff were definitely its best.

The bedroom was spacious, comfortable and most importantly very clean, had a decent hairdryer as well as the usual facilities, even a coffee machine!

The pool area was lovely, clean and warm.  I was with my son so I didn’t get to use the jacuzzi which looked very inviting or the other amenities.

Must not forget the food!  The menu choices are great, I didn’t eat on the restaurant but had lunch in the beautiful and well laid out lobby lounge area and highly recommend the goats cheese salad, it was well priced, delicious and very filling.  The snack I ordered to our room later was more like a dinner it was so plentiful.

The car park attendant and reception staff were so helpful getting me a spot at the EV charger the morning before I left as it had been busy since my arrival.  And I was allowed to leave my car safely parked and charging after checkout while I attended my sons appointment.

I can’t rate this hotel and staff high enough, everyone was so helpful, polite and kind especially to my young son, he wasn’t charged for breakfast and even got to have a conversation through Irish with a lovely waitress, it’s always nice to hear our native tongue outside the Irish speaking communities.

I will be back with the rest of the family on tow!",5,2021,11,27
248,business,"Hotel services, cleanliness, check in etc all spot on. Nothing pretentious, just solid service. Food spot on also.
Leisure centre could be a bit cleaner - regular wash down and clean seemed to be missing - possibly a staff issue in these times as we climb slowly out of COVID",4,2021,11,12
248,Perfect for a weekend break ,"Excellent location on the busy Camden Street where you have great Guinness bars and Michelin restaurants. 
The staff in the hotel are friendly and helpful. 
Parking is below the hotel and charged at €20 per night. 
The room was very clean. Excellent shower and very comfortable bed.
Easy walking distance to Dublin Castle, Stephens Green and Temple Bar.

248,Lovely hotel,"Stayed here on Saturday night. We were a bit early for check in but our room was ready. Lovely, room nice a spacious and nice bathroom.

No need to book a time for breakfast so you can go anytime between 7-11am. Is a budget breakfast. Probably one of the nicest breakfasts I have had in a hotel. 

Lovely lobby area you can sit and relax in. Would definitely recommend and stay again. Great location.",4,2021,10,17
248,Our Go-to in Dublin,"Camden Court has undergone some major upgrades to the rooms and lobby, but the service is still spectacular.  We arrived well before check-in time and were greeted warmly and allowed to move into our rooms.  They just could not have been nicer.   One gentleman spent a half hour helping our driver try to park our monster van in the parking lot.  Great location for easy walking downtown.  We thoroughly enjoyed our stay there....again!",5,2021,10,09
248,Pull your socks up Camden Court,"Sorry that I’m only getting around to writing this now for my stay back in Mid-August. Can I start with saying the Camden Court used to be a fantastic hotel. So much so, that back in 2001/02, I practically lived in the hotel Mon-Fri for a year while working in Dublin. So having not stayed in it for some years I was really looking forward to staying a couple of nights after lockdown.
Upon arrival, we were lucky enough to be able to park the car in the hotel car park, always a major bonus in Dublin if you drive. The car parking was complimentary if the hotel was booked using their own website, but has limited space so beware. Reception staff could not have been nicer. Even though we were earlier than the check-in time we were given our room straight away. 
Unfortunately, it went downhill from there. Bear in mind that we are still in the midst of a pandemic with the promises of extra cleaning made by hotels. Our room was disgusting. There was hair in the shower tray, hair on the bathroom floor and worst of all, nail clippings on the bathroom floor. We reported this to one of the housekeeping staff, who stated that even though it wasn’t her room, she would clean it for us straight away. When she seen it, she agreed that it was disgusting and asked for our permission to report it to her supervisor. 
However, it didn’t end there. We had to use a wipe to clean a stain off the headboard and when we pulled the quilt back to check the bed, there was also long hairs on the bedsheet and a stain too, suggesting that the sheet hadn’t even been changed, in this day and age? At this point my wife went down to reception to complain.
Again, reception were fantastic, and so mortified that they called the manager. To the manager’s credit, he didn’t even try to talk his way out of it or offer excuses, but upgraded us to a suite with a personal guarantee that he would go and check the new room for cleanliness. They say “all’s well that ends well” but even the new suite had dirty marks up the walls and I certainly wouldn’t have been happy with it had I paid the full cost for a suite. The hotel just seems like they’ve given up. And even though we spent very little time in the main foyer, we witnessed a few other complaints being made at reception too, although I’ve no idea what these were about.
My wife and I visit Dublin for short stays, usually 2 or 3 nights, about 6 or 8 times per year. We’ve been doing this for 20 years and in all that time, this was the first time I was ever happy to be checking out and coming home.

248,Convenient hotel for access to central Dublin,Recently had a 2 day stay at the Camden Court Hotel. The hotel is convenient to city Centre. The environment is spacious and clean. The staff were friendly and most helpful. The bedrooms were serviced daily and very clean. We really enjoyed the breakfast with all possible options available. The leisure centre was spacious and as a guest we were given gowns for wearing to pool area.,4,2021,09,30
248,Terrible Food,"This is more a review of The Iveagh Restaurant in the hotel. Food was just shocking. Starter was bruschetta..hard to get it wrong you would think, but they did. Menu said sourdough with chopped tomatoes, olive oil, torn basil and fresh garlic..sounds lovely. What we got was just chopped tomatoes on 2 small slices of bread. No fresh garlic, olive oil or basil. They had also added parmesan which wasn't in menu and shouldn't be on bruschetta. 
I ordered quinoa in a coconut curry sauce for main. It was just a pile of dry bland quinoa with some burnt veg with the merest hint of an Indian curry coating on the veg. No lovely coconut curry sauce.  My partner asked for steak medium rare. It was well done. We sent back our mains without eating them. Very disappointing experience.",1,2021,09,21
248,Great Hotel in Dublin,"Booked the Camden Court Hotel for a long weekend. Well situated in the city the hotel is well maintained. The staff are friendly, polite and very helpful. Rooms are very comfortable and of a high standard. The food in the restaurant is excellent and we certainly recommend a meal at the hotel at least once. The health spa is great and kept very clean and is time slot managed due to Covid restrictions. In the surrounding neighbourhood there are plenty of bars and restaurants and the hotel is only a 15 to 20 minute walk from the main centre of Dublin and the river. We would certainly stay here again.",5,2021,09,19
248,Noisy,"Am still here at present. Its 7 am , have been woken again from 6am with lorries, deliveries etc. Came here for a two day break. Can't wait to leave, if I had car I would already be gone. BTW,  I stayed in 527. Would feccomend for hotel to leave earplugs in every room.
Def not be back.",2,2021,09,16
248,"Beautiful, clean and a genuinely friendly hotel.",Stayed here overnight Sat-Sun at the beginning of September. Check-in was seamless and very professional. Stay purpose was a meeting with family from overseas. Had room service for both dinner and breakfast. Lunch was in the lobby the next day. All of the food was really good. Reception very helpful in getting me a taxi. Great service all round. Will definitely be back.,5,2021,09,08
248,Great place to stay,I have stayed at the Camden Court many times on both business and pleasure and each time I have had a great stay. The hotel is in a great location on Camden street with lots of pubs and places to eat and a short walk to Grafton street. A lovely comfortable hotel with a great lobby bar for drinks and food. Breakfast has a great selection and the rooms are simply lovely with everything you need. Staff are always warm and welcoming.,5,2021,09,08
248,Fantastic hotel,"We stayed three nights in the Camden Court Hotel and had such a great time there.
The breakfast was fabulous with a massive thank you to Robbie the chef who served us a delicious full Irish breakfast every morning.
The pool facilities were lovely and the room we were allocated was on the sixth floor with a lovely view. 

The street that the hotel is located on is full of bars and restaurants, along with the Luas stop around the corner and shopping streets such as Grafton street and St Stephens Green only being a 10 minute walk from the hotel. 
Overall, we had a fabulous stay and I would recommend this hotel to anyone!",5,2021,09,08
248,A Dubliner's perspective: a great place to stay!,"My husband and I returned to Dublin to see family and friends who live on the southside and northside of Dublin. I am originally from this area so please don't think this is bias - I am VERY fussy about where I stay and what I do in Dublin ;). The Camden Court is perfectly positioned for access to the Luas tram (Harcourt stop) into the city centre and there are plenty of buses that locally serve the area too. The walk from the hotel is 20-25 minutes from Grafton St. The hotel is very clean, friendly, attentive staff. Our room as positioned on the 4th floor facing the back where there is the 'Camden Yard' restaurant. This can get a little loud at night up to 11pm but with the window closed its not a problem. The swimming pool is lovely and  the veggie food isn't bad (well, that's the salads) & Guinness at the hotel is really good. I have found a new place to station myself for my future home visits - Thank you Camden Court!",5,2021,09,02
248,"Ok for 1 night, but i’d stay somewhere else next time.","We stayed here for our wedding anniversary. The hotel does have basement parking for free for hotel resident. 

Our room was not ready by 14:00. My husband loves the spa facilities, he said it was the best from this hotel. We booked to use the steam room 1 week before but we only got 1 slot to use it on Sunday 12.00. After my husband went there, I asked him was it full? He said, nah it was empty. 

The room was small compare to Holiday Inn Dublin Airport we stayed on previous nights, maybe because Camden is located in the city centre so they tried to save space. The room had no AC which we knew when we booked but doesnt realize it’s very much bothering when you traveling in summer + pregnant + cant get any breeze even when you open the window + youre the type of person who cant sleep if its too warm. They provide a fan, though which is very thoughtful. Although we kept the fan running at night but the duvet cover was a winter duvet so it’s still warm at night. 

The breakfast was okay, i don’t like the gloomy looking restaurant maybe because the hotel is old. Staff reserved us 1 table, we went to get our food, when we came back to our table some other group already seated there so we were like “huh??” Seems the staff doesn’t care about table reservation. 

Camden team was very thoughtful on leaving us a wedding anniversary card with a box of chocolates which was very nice of them.",4,2021,08,31
248,Disappointing Family Break,"Stayed in Camden Court from Monday 23 - Wednesday 25 Aug 2021. On arrival at hotel car park was full so not a good start. At checkin the young guy provided me with a WiFi code that was not required but did not advise me that if looking to use swimming pool it would be good to book. When I tried to book the pool later it was fully booked and kids were disappointed. Breakfast was another disappointment where food was thrown on the plate and the staff were unfriendly and did not listen to what you wanted. On the last evening the hotel and area had a power cut - not the fault of hotel. Checking out on Wednesday morning the desk manager never asked how my stay was, mentioned or apologised for the power cut or made any customer chat.  In relation to Covid-19 I was disappointed as the room still had magazines and cushions in the room where every other hotel had removed such items. Items at breakfast table were not removed or replaced between customers so risk of infection 
but hand gel was available at arrival and at lift.  Overall the hotel lacked any customer service, lacked air conditioning in rooms so rooms noisy due to windows open and was a real disappointment having previously stayed and enjoyed the hotel a few years ago.  I would not recommend the Camden Court to friends or be returning soon.",2,2021,08,28
248,Great midweek break,Stayed here with my son onba Wednesday and Thursday for a short break. Right from the start at reception the welcome was great from Stella. We had a small lunch and a couple of drinks served by Katie first day and Ali the second young people but their service was much appreciated and very good. We had dinner one night amd it was quite good again the staff were very helpful and they were under immense pressure as are all hospitality staff. Well done i will be back thank you. ,5,2021,08,22
248,Great gym,"Epic gym & spa facilities and brilliant staff. Very well organised booking system for gym and spa was on point. They do memberships for non hotel residents too!!!

Definitely recommend this even if you’re not staying there!",5,2021,08,19
248,Lovely stay,We stayed for 1 night and had a lovely time. Room was great and we got to check in early. The pool and facilities were great...only downside was having to book a slot. Food was really nice and service very efficient. The location is very convenient. Would definitely visit again.,5,2021,08,15
248,Honeymoon,"We booked here last minute for our honeymoon it was amazing 😍 there was a lovely card and a box of chocolates in the room when we arrived. On our first night we ate in the restaurant and what a meal, we decided against a dessert but 1 of the staff came out with 1 to celebrate our wedding day 😍. Staff were amazing and so helpful. Would highly recommend a stay.",5,2021,08,15
248,Fantastic hotel,"We visited this hotel on the 8th August for three nights. The hotel is absolutely fantastic and the staff are very friendly, courteous and polite nothing was every any trouble they are an credit to the hotel.  The room we were allocated was on the fifth floor a stunning and modern room with a fridge and large TV and bed and cleaned to perfection. If you require the leisure facilities I would advise to book these before your trip.  Book through the hotel and the car parking was free. It is a central hotel only 10 mins by foot to the city centre.  The street itself that the hotel is situated has a lot going on with bars, restaurants and shops.

The only one criticism I would have about the hotel is in the restaurant in the evening it was very disorganised. They could not find our booking table service was slow, the food for the cost was just ok very tiny portions had to request the drinks menu twice we were left sitting for at least 20 minutes before anyone took are order.  The restaurant seemed more focused on serving the customers in the court yard and not inside the restaurant we asked if we could order off an alternative menu and we were told we could not however the table opposite us had ordered from the other menu but we had been refused.  I could understand if the restaurant was running to full capacity however it was not even a third full.  Staff are very slow in cleaning tables at breakfast and in the evening.

This was only one small thing we had not liked it was not a huge problem and it's something that could be easily sorted.

I would have no hesitation in booking this hotel again and would bring the kids the next time it seems like a very family friendly hotel.  Over all it is an absolutely fantastic hotel and I would recommend this hotel to anyone.",5,2021,08,15
248,Anniversary,"We had a super break away in a spotless comfy room . The spa area had to be booked it was lovely . Staff were so nice and gave us a box of chocolates and a card . Breakfast was exceptional , we were so central snd I highly recommend this hotel .",5,2021,08,13
248,Lovely hotel - hidden gem,"Really enjoyed our stay here. I’ve passed it a million times and never thought to stay before. 

Location is great, ample options to eat & drink. Yes, there’s some noise outside, but it is a city centre location.

Pool is a great bonus, if a little small but good fun & well managed. 

Órla Kiely Toiletries a lovely touch.

Staff professional & communicative.

We didn’t eat but menu looked nice.",4,2021,08,11
248,Ok,"Stayed for 7 nights. Overall we enjoyed but some things need attention and consistency . 
Pros. Room was adequate , but two people staying in room , had one cup . Tea bags , no milk on some days- had to request more each day.  Rooms very hot - no air con. Rooms very noisy as on main road and had to sleep with window open due to heat . 
Good power shower, comfy beds.
Gym was good, 
Cons:- breakfast very slow and ‘food just adequate’. Large breakfast area, few staff who worked very hard but could not keep up with pace or amount of people. Some days dirty tables were not being cleaned and people made to queue up whilst they waited for clean tables. Most days had to request tea/ coffee, only on one occasion were we brought tea/ coffee at breakfast . Waiting for over 30 minutes on a few occasions . Some foods weren’t replenished fast enough in buffet. Just didn’t appear to have many staff which resulted in poor service . 
Had to book pool day or two in advance . Some days no availability . Pool hot tub , sauna all good if you got in.
Not guaranteed a parking space in underground car park which was very small given size of hotel . 
Food at dinner very average , again had to get a member of staff to order food , drinks or pay bill- poor attention to customer or again could have been too few staff on duty . 
Ten minute walk from city centre",3,2021,08,06
248,Ok if you don’t want to use the food and beverage services within the hotel,"A few staff members were quite rude and abrupt. I understand the frustrations of the industry but the service my friend and I received was deplorable. Left waiting for 20 minutes and then when I had to shout across the lobby to get the attention of one of the staff members i was asked if I wanted menus. I was then served an “Espresso Martini”, which was watery and generally not up to standard. My friend ordered a mojito which was also not nice. We went out for dinner and on our return it was the same thing staff walking around and it felt they were ignoring our table.To be honest I probably wouldn’t stay again but if you’re looking for somewhere to sleep and plan on being out of the hotel for most of your stay then I suppose it would be fine. Just to note rooms are very warm and no fan provided in our room. Overall a disappointing stay.",2,2021,08,04
248,Not what I expected ,We stayed here with my husband and kids looked lovely on the web site I don't know where those nice rooms where that they have up because we didn't get one .  Very old run down the walls have marks and are dirty there's bits gone off the door holes in the curtains lamps old and yellow stains on the carpet very disappointing. . Couldn't believe it when we arrived   The staff were nice very slow to bring out lunch I had mine gone before my husband's was out . Probably wouldn't stay here again the rooms definitely need some sorting out,3,2021,08,04
248,Okay but expensive,Bedrooms are adequate but no air conditioning. WiFi drops in and out constantly so you cannot work online in applications. Breakfast buffet not bad but an expensive extra. Good location 15 mins walk to main bars and restaurant area where locals go.,3,2021,08,04
248,Bridesmaids!,"We came from cork for a trip to purchase bridesmaid dresses with all my bridesmaids. When we arrived we were welcomed by a lovely gentleman on reception he was absolutely fantastic!! 

We came back later that evening about 10.30 for a few drinks in the lobby which is stunning. But it was a pity the girl serving us was particularly rude “we aren’t serving anymore what do ye want before we close” not the friendliest at all and let the place down a bit. 

Orla kiely toiletries were a gorgeous touch!!

Will return!!",4,2021,07,31
248," Too noisy will not be back ","Very central hotel, good parking but so noisy that we could not come back. Heat in rooms was as usual in Ireland ridiculous.
Pool was booked out so we never even saw it.
Clean rooms but no won't be back.
Noise was from people and music in outdoor dining area. ",2,2021,07,30
248,Avoid if temperatures over 20 degrees,"Stayed here during the middle of July. Temperatures outside were in the late 20s. This made the room very uncomfortable as there was no air conditioning in the room. There was a fan in the wardrobe but this made little or no impact to the room temperature. Our room looked very ‘tired’ as there was a lot of marks on the walls and dust on the windowsills and bathroom door. I noticed a previous poster write about a sanitised sticker on the door, perhaps our room hadn’t been used from last year. There was also fingerprints and hard marks on the mirror. We have stayed at this hotel in previous years and we were let down by the condition of the bedroom when we visited this time. In bad need of a refurb. The image used in the main trip advisor photo couldnt be further from the truth!!
We ate dinner 1 night at the hotel as this was included in our rate. The meal was nothing to write home about. I certainly was glad we didn’t have to pay for it. We also had use of the pool. If you are staying please ensure to book your time slots before you arrive as booking the day before left us unable to get a slot. Overall the hotel is in a useful location and the free parking was also a plus. Not that we will be back to use it again!",2,2021,07,29
248,"Very Disappointing, Do NOT support breastfeeding mothers.","Before our trip I had requested a fridge in our room via email, I was confirmed that this would not be a problem. on arrival I asked at reception to confirm that I had one in my room and was told no. I explained I had breast milk that needed refrigerated as I had defrosted it for my trip & brought with me on a cool bag. The lady on reception just said there was none available regardless of my previous request.
The next day I asked again, as I knew people would be checking out & the guy on reception basically told me no, but I could use a fridge in the bar, which would have been fine if I was offered this the day before as I already had to dispose of all my milk!!!!! Disposing of good milk to a breastfeeding mother is heart breaking, ruined our break away.

The man who appeared to be in-charge of breakfast was an very rude individual, arguing with other staff members in front of us and was not approachable or friendly.  It appeared waiting on tables was beneath him.

We noticed all other rooms had sanitised stickers on the door on arrival, ours did not, which made us feel uncomfortable. Staff didn’t really give a damn about this either. 

The waiter staff in the restaurant, the chef at breakfast, the staff in the leisure centre & the cleaners could not have been nicer! Very friendly and helpful. Credit to your hotel!

It’s a shame about the rest of the staff. Will not be back and certainly will be letting all family and friends know if the disappointment and poor service we received. ",2,2021,07,26
248,Brilliant from start to finish,"We stayed here for 1 night midweek and cannot find fault. From the moment we walked in the staff were friendly and efficient, the room was spotless (and thank God for the fan!) The location is great - a 10 minute stroll to Grafton Street.  We had dinner in the lobby as it was too warm for a big meal in the restaurant- the food was lovely and the staff brilliant.  The next morning we had a dip in the pool and breakfast after - the breakfast was 1 of the best we've had in a hotel.  Altogether just a fantastic night away. We would definitely stay here again. Make sure to book through the hotel website for the free parking.",5,2021,07,22
248,Fantastic Hotel for a family break,"We booked Camden Court Hotel for a family break with 3 teenagers.  The hotel was brilliant from start to finish. The staff in all departments are very efficient and friendly, the food was so tasty and the rooms are very clean and comfortable.  We used the swimming pool and it was easy to book a slot for it and for the gym.  There was a great atmosphere in the hotel with families, couples etc.  This is not the first time we have stayed here and it won't be the last - thanks very much, we have been highly recommending it to family and friends.",5,2021,07,19
248,City Break,"Stayed here last week for four days. B&B, three evening meals, use of facilities and free car parking all included which was fantastic value. We were on 6th floor, super views, room well maintained by the staff, in fact all the staff throughout the hotel were lovely and polite. The hotel is very central and within walking distance of everything which we certainly did! Only fault was the coffee in the morning was not that hot but every hotel has that problem! The food was perfect in fact the breakfast was right up there with the best! Even with restrictions we weren't inconvenienced too much. Can't wait to return and without doubt if this offer is still on will be back in a heartbeat. Will certainly be staying here again!!",5,2021,07,19
248,Great,"Great value for money and very helpful staff great place for the family.   

We stayed with 2 children 8 and 4 and the loved it the pool was great the food was better.

Located perfect for city walking and visiting anything you want to do highly recommended for a family stay.",5,2021,07,14
248,Great night,"We had an amazing time here last night, check in was quick rooms are so clean and modern, food was delish and id like to give Aaron the waiter a big shout out he only started a few weeks ago and he was amazing so helpful will definitely visit again",5,2021,07,11
248,Recommended,"I stayed at the Camden Court for four nights in the last week of June 2021 and it was a great experience. The hotel is modern, bright and centrally located, around a 5-10 minute walk to Grafton Street. The complimentary underground parking was the reason I decided to stay here travelling from NI. All of the staff were helpful and courteous for the duration of my stay, they are a credit to this hotel. I was given a room on the sixth floor, and the check-in staff advised this was part of their newly refurbished suite. The rooms are modern, comfortable with a very large TV. They were cleaned every day by the housekeeping staff which was a pleasant surprise during COVID restrictions. I had breakfast and an evening meal each day in the hotel and the food was consistently excellent. The service was prompt, and the restaurant staff were pleasant. There were a few issues, for example the WI-FI in the room didn't always work, it seems to be intermittent at the best of times which was annoying. Also, hotel guests are allowed to use the swimming pool/sauna etc but not allowed to use the changing rooms meaning we had to walk through the hotel soaking wet in a bathrobe with water going over the lift etc. This is a daft measure to have in place when guests are mixing in the pool anyway and hopefully removed soon once the COVID restrictions ease. Anyway, I found there to be a good atmosphere in the Camden Court and with very comfortable rooms and great food and facilities, I hope to return soon. Highly recommended.",5,2021,07,07
248,Absolutely brilliant,"We stayed here for one night, location excellent. Restaurant, reception, rooms, leisure centre,  are  excellent. We will certainly be back here. Tip book through the official site for best price, and free parking. Also check the bar menu before booking the restaurant, as the meals there looked amazing.",5,2021,07,05
248,Camden Yard,"Camden Yard is a fantastic set up and the staff, particularly Jasmine, were extremely helpful and accommodating. The food trucks were a great touch. High recommend going here on a Friday (no booking necessary).",5,2021,07,05
248,Great hotel in a central location.,Helpful friendly staff. Great food and value for money. If you are nervous about socially distancing this hotel is perfect plenty of big open areas inside and out. I will definitely be recommending this hotel to family and friends. ,5,2021,06,29
248,Amazing,"Amazing staff, leisure facilities are lovely, the rooms could do with a bit of updating. The staff would go out of their way to help you. The complimentary parking was amazing, that was a deciding factor as it’s so difficult and expensive to park in Dublin centre.",5,2021,06,25
248,Amazing and Comfortable.,"it was so clean and staff was so helpful and nice. The room was lovely and comfortable. The food in the restaurant or in the lobby was both gorgeous so nice. Me and my partner went there for a weekend to celebrate our birthday, We had such a good time here and the leisure centre was amazing so relaxing.",5,2021,06,21
248,Fantastic stay,"Highly recommend, would definitely go back.

Great pool/ jacuzzi/ facilities, delicious breakfast,  comfy beds,
Reasonable price, 
Rooms abit loud, & bar service could improve 
",4,2021,06,14
248,Terrible rude staff,"The manager us terribly rude and miss represent the hotel and Ireland horribly. They won't want to cooperate and arrange a rescheduling of my reservation and fully charge me for the days i couldn't arrive at the hotel because mu trip was cancelled. I understand in this unprecedented times hotels should be more flexible, however the stuff in this hotel has no training on costumer services whatsoever, neither a little bit of sympathy",1,2021,06,10
248,For a Dubliner's real staycation - and a tourist's vacation,"Great hotel in a great spot. Lovely staff, comfortable beds, and  spotless. My daughter and I have stayed here before, last September, when we had the hotel pretty much to ourselves. A very different atmosphere this time, very buzzy ",5,2021,06,08
248,THE IVEAGH RESTAURANT,"Felt embarrassed for the staff who had to deal with people tonight.  Everything was perfect until we went for our meal, Their kitchen had a meltdown, I'm 99% sure everyone got Mc Donald's fries with their meals as the potato option.
 I should have realized that the kitchen was not 100% when I arrived at my table at 7pm and the people at the adjacent table were earing a pizza from a box. They weren't even busy, less than 15 tables the whole night.
  I was embarrassed for the staff,  it was uncomfortable,  the staff were professional but the management should never have put them in that position. 
  Everything was perfect except the dining.",5,2021,06,07
248,..,"Very nice hotel room and pool was lovely, how ever 1 of the managers was so rude, service was terrible left waiting an hour for a drink nearly the same time for our meal. Definitely wouldn't be going back again. The new girl jasmine was absolutely amazing done everything she could for us",3,2021,06,07
248,Wonderful stay,"Excellent stay at the hotel - very relaxed atmosphere, while also feeling very safe and comfortable. Great dinner in the dining room. Beautiful breakfast! All staff very helpful, friendly and accommodating.",5,2021,06,07

248,Christmas Eve stay ,"Myself and my partner booked last minute for a one night stay on Christmas Eve. 

Check in was was very quick and I was greeted my a lovely man at the reception who was very friendly and helpful. The room and hotel overall seems to be very modern and decorated beautifully.

We ordered room service that came quickly and again staff were lovely again while bringing up the food. 

The only downfall was that you could hear people chatting in the hallway, although it wasn’t a major issue.

Overall a nice hotel and great staff in a very good location.

I would highly recommend !!",4,2020,12,25
248,Overnight in Dublin,"Great location, very friendly staff, the hotel has adapted well to Covid-19.
We were, however, unfortunate with the location of our room, as the neightbouring rooms guests revelled through the night, leaving us with very little sleep.",4,2020,12,22
248,Great food,"Met my friend and had a great lunch service is quick and food was amazing, tasty and fresh.we had chicken goujons and chips, we had a choice of chunky or skinny chips they were fab... the staff are great and place was spotless ",5,2020,12,21
248,Guinness top notch,Excellent check- in. Room adequate. It was oddly laid- out with a tight shower and general lack of attention to finer detail but this is a minor and perhaps a subjective gripe. Barry’s tea in room a great find as were the nice toiletries. Food in bar/ foyer freshly prepared and very tasty. Exquisite Guinness ( did not expect such a perfect pint in a hotel) and perfect temperature brandy. Staff most efficient and professional. Bathrobes in room. Huge TV. Thank you Camden Court!,5,2020,12,15
248,Nice stay,Had a nice stay at the hotel and the rooms are fabulous and modern. Cleaning in rooms could be slightly better and food also. But the overall stay was enjoyable. Enjoyed a lovely bottle of prosecco on one of the nights. ,4,2020,12,13

248,Amazing hotel,"The hotel is absolutely gorgeous, with a beautiful lobby and spacious rooms.

248,Great Hotel in Good location!,"Very happy with this place and it's consistently good overall quality. Staff is very friendly and helpful, Rooms are clean and confortable.

248,Highly recommended ,"We couldn’t have had a better stay at Camden Court Hotel. Very child friend and they put a cot in our room for us. Our room was very quiet but I had requested that as we have a 11 month old baby.  Room was stylish and most importantly clean.  Even tho sauna, jacuzzi and stream room was closed due to cover the warm swimming pool made up for it, was booking to reduce timber (was 10 in when we were in) we called the night before to get a slot.  Staff are the best part of the hotel,  couldn’t have been more helpful and welcoming.  Coffee machine in room and massive tv were great touches!  Area was busy with lots to do and 20 min walk to the centre of Dublin.  I will 100% be back in the near future and it was the best part of our Dublin stay.  ",5,2020,09,04

Bed was very comfortable, very good shower. The location is prefect - Luas stop around the corner and very central - walking distance to the beautiful St Stephen's Green. There is a swimming pool which is unusual in a city centre hotel. We didn't eat so can't comment on the food.  Parking was included in the very reasonable cost of the room. Very spacious foyer/reception which may social distancing very easy so we could relax.",5,2020,07,30

Decided to have breakfast in room only 3.50 I have been charged 10 euro in other hotels. Lovely breakfast  great location so handy for Luas, I will be a regular from now. Thanks for a lovely 2 day break.",5,2020,07,22

Customer service was outstanding. The best I have ever experienced.  Room and hotel were spotlessly clean. Location was perfect. Only a 15 minute walk to city centre. 
Had dinner here the evening we arrived. The food was not good at all. Very poor standard compared to the rest of the hotel. The worst food I’ve ever eaten from a hotel. I would definetly stay here again but never eat here again. There are fantastic restaurants, pubs and cafes on their door step.

248,Fantastic Anniversary Stay,"We have just checked out from a 2 day stay and can't compliment the hotel enough! 

The room we were given was fantastic, the staff were so attentive and friendly, the phone call from the head of sales Denise was warm & welcoming and the breakfast both mornings was 5 star!

This hotel is in a great location, the lovely Camden bar down the street is a great spot & it's just a 10 minute walk to Grafton Street & St Stephens Green & a further 10 minute stroll to Temple Bar.

The hotel has a swimming pool, we didn't make use of it this time but we will be returning as a family and I'm sure the kids will make great use of it.

Thank you so much for making our stay so enjoyable Camden Court especially with the backdrop of Covid19 not diminishing our stay at all.

See you soon.",5,2020,07,01
248,Overnight stay.,"We booked this hotel for an overnight stay as part of our wider trip to Ireland. We were driving so it was important to have somewhere with ample car parking. The location is very good, particularly for the main tourist sites south of the river. You can walk to St Stephens Green and Grafton Street in less than 10 minutes. There is a good choice of restaurants, bars and pubs within the vicinity of the hotel.
Check in was very quick and friendly. 
The room was great, very spacious and modern with all the facilities you would expect from a 4 star hotel. 
We had drinks in the bar on the first evening and really enjoyed it, it was lively with very friendly bar staff. We did not use the restaurant.
Breakfast the following morning was great, a really good choice and ample space.
We did not get a chance to use the health club or swimming pool as our time was limited but we did have a look and the facilities looked great.
Overall a fantastic choice of hotel, modern, very friendly and helpful, great facilities, ample parking and a great location.",5,2020,04,22
248,Rugby weekend,"Visit here as part of a rugby weekend 
Room clean and comfortable, breakfast good ; great location. we attended the match and on return attempted to log on to return flight - as due to strong winds many flights were cancelled 
I opened safe to find iPad missing ; both myself husband and son - who lives close by searched room and safe 
No sign reporting the incident to duty manager - His reply you sure you brought it could you be mistaken- not sure why would have reported if not brought !
Next morning same story different manager - not saying your lying but !!
So we attended the local Garda station and reported bathe item missing- returns and rechecked room still no sign
We booked out I informed manager had reported and left hotel to wait to be picked up just outside 
Here comes manager with iPad - was in your safe vertical an iPad ina typical hotel safe - impossible 
Happy to have it back. But an unsettling experience which spoilt a great weekend 
Just unsettled by experience- anyone experienced similar 
Would iPad have returned had we not reported to Garda?",3,2020,04,05
248,"Brilliantly Priced, well looked after","I'd happily visit the hotel again were I to visit Dublin again - but felt it was a really good hotel rather than exceptional (iyswim).  Everything was as expected.  Service great, room comfortable, facilities fine.  We didn't breakfast here as we wanted to try elsewhere - so can't comment on the food.  However I try to reserve 5* for places that are above and beyond - but as I've said in my opening comment - I would happily return.  Its also well placed for the tram to everywhere - so convenient.",4,2020,03,05
248,Great hotel,"Lovely hotel. location was great. Close to grafton Street, which we wanted. Room comfortable and clean. Breakfast was lovely. Bar in the reception area was nice to sit and have drinks and night. Would stay again",5,2020,03,04
248,Wow.....Irish hospitality,"We went to this hotel for a Birthday treat for me set up by my Wife.
The service we received was exceptional. 
Steve was the duty manager who went above and beyond from the moment we arrived until the moment we left. 
The food is excellent and reasonably priced for a quality hotel in Dublin.
Breakfast was excellent and you get a lot of choice. 
As I have to use a walking stick the waitress even came up to the hotplate to carry my tray. I can honestly say we received the best service than any hotel we've ever been to, Irish Hospitality at its very best.
The rooms are very good and I understand they're all getting refurbished this year.
Thank you for an excellent weekend and we look forward to returning very soon.",5,2020,03,02
248,Great Stay,"Overall good quality service and facilities , with breakfast buffet being superb. Cleanliness and all round cleaning of the rooms was of the highest order. My bed was also very comforatble and food was of highest quality",4,2020,03,02
248,Great hotel in excellent location.,"I stayed in a twin room. Lovely clean hotel. Friendly staff. Nice Orla Kiely products in bathroom. Also hairdryer, TV, coffee machine and kettle. Ice machine on the corridor. Hotel was quiet which was surprising as our room was facing out onto busy Camden St. It is very well located for all the city centre attractions. We had our main meal in the bar on the evening we arrived, the  food was ok. We had room only booking but decided to have coffee and scones following day for  breakfast in the foyer, this was lovely and perfect for a light meal. I will definitely book here again.",5,2020,03,02
248,Beautiful hotel,"My husband and I stayed here for the weekend as we were here for a concert.
We arrived very early and check in wasn’t until 2pm but since the room was ready they let us through as early as 10am, which was fantastic. The staff at reception were very friendly and efficient. They provided us with a map of the area that had something for everyone, from pubs to the best jogging routes. 
 The room was beautiful and clean. That pillows were decent which is a great bonus. There was a kettle as well as a coffee maker. The bathroom was spotless and the towels were whiter than snow. The staff were on hand for anything and everything.
Our only set back was the food. We ordered room service, which came very quickly but the food was lacking and they didn’t take our order right. That’s the only thing we could say wasn’t perfect but other than that it’s an amazing hotel, in a perfect location with fantastic staff. Would definitely recommend to anyone visiting Dublin. If we ever find ourselves here again we will absolutely be staying here 😊",4,2020,03,01
248,Excellent!,"Excellent hotel in every respect. Staff were friendly, efficient and helpful. Rooms are modern and fresh. The bar food and breakfast were delicious. Everything was to a very high standard. Will definitely be staying again.",5,2020,02,29
248,Excellent staff but too noisy to sleep,"While the staff were very helpful, our street facing room was relentlessly noisy with traffic and no good glazing; we had to move rooms after midnight as the buses continued to rumble and cars to rev.  Then, in our quieter room, we were woken by drilling above us at 7.45 am, and this happened the next morning too as they are doing work. Ask for a quiet room when you book and ask about renovations. 
Public areas and bar food are nice but the bedding is a bit tired for a 4 star and it is time to move to refill bottles not plastic individual ones if the hotel genuinely wants to be more eco. 
The staff were very helpful and pleasant and it’s a good central location if you can sleep through anything,",2,2020,02,29
248,Excellent location,"Close to bars and restaurants. National Concert Hall 5 min walk. and City Centre 10 - 15 mins Walk.
Rooms extremely clean and fresh. Warm welcome from all on the reception desk. I did not use the leisure facilities available in the hotel so I can't really comment on them. The hotel is bright and airy and has a large lounge area with a well stocked bar.",5,2020,02,25
248,3 day break,"We wanted something central and that is what it is, nice hotel although service was more miss than hit and had a room roadside, which if you didn't have enough Guiness was noisy. Gym and swimming pool were a nice touch.",4,2020,02,21
248,Good swimming pool,"I spent three nights here and enjoyed my stay. The room was spacious and well equipped except other than coffee in the room there was only one sort of tea. To be fair I didn't ask if peppermint or green tea was available for the room. Luckily I had brought my own supply of hot chocolate. The room and bathroom was spotless. There was a nice big TV although I didn't have time to explore what channels are available - I watched the Champions League games in the bar. As this hotel has a very good swimming pool, sauna and steam bath it would have been nice to have had a bathrobe and slippers provided. I only ate one evening meal in the hotel but it was very good (fish and chips). The breakfast buffet had a good selection but I think the tea/coffee service could be improved. On the second morning my order was forgotten and I had to ask another waitress. On the third morning I had to ask a passing waitress. Usually in hotels you are asked for your tea/coffee order as soon as you sit down - this wasn't the case here. However I would stay here again just for the swimming pool alone.",4,2020,02,21
248,"Good location for bars, eateries & sight seeing","This is a nice 4* hotel in a pretty lively neighbourhood with plenty of bars, cafes and restaurants nearby. Also walking distance to Temple Bar, Dublin Castle, Trinity College etc.

Locally, we went to Devitt's pub, Cracked Nut cafe, Mad Egg restaurant and Cherry Comedy at Whelans - all recommended.

As for our stay, check in was swift, polite staff and clear info on breakfast, health club facilities etc. We went to our room on 3rd floor and unpacked. There was constant drilling and hammering coming from hotel renovations. Called reception who swiftly moved us to another room on 5th floor at other end of hotel. From here, no noise. Pleased it was dealt with so promptly. Decent range of Freeview channels plus Netflix in room was handy. Coffee machine was decent. Shower was nice and powerful.

Used the pool one evening, steam room and sauna good - jacuzzi was out of action which was disappointing. Used gym once, decent hotel gym (also used by locals as a member's gym). I'd not want to have this as my only gym if I lived locally, but it was better than a lot of hotel gyms, 4 treadmills, various free weights and a few machines.

Paid for breakfast for last day. This is €13 if you pay the night before or €17 if you pay on the morning. It is probably worth €13, no more though. Had a nice selection, cooked breakfast and some fruit, pastries yoghurt etc. Enjoyed it. One major downside was the attitude of the woman serving the breakfast. Didn't catch her name: a larger, older lady with a scowling expression - reminiscent of a school dinner lady. When my wife went up the server said ""Jesus Christ, everytime I go to walk away someone else comes up."" Absolutely unacceptable and unnecessary as it was actually really quiet, midweek in February. Probably about 25% capacity in the restaurant. Also unclear as to why she is needed to serve you the cooked breakfast when this is normally self service in hotels, and everything else was self service? Other staff were all friendly.

Overall, this is a hotel that I would be happy to return to when next in Dublin. A few negatives did not prevent us from having a really good break and the room and facilities were good overall.",4,2020,02,20
248,Great stay,"Great hotel and highly recommend. Great staff with free access to the spa. Clean rooms, good breakfast great location and good access to the Luas/trains/Dart and city centre is walking distance. Would stay again.",5,2020,02,18
248,Nice hotel,"This was a lovely stay. We had 2 rooms - one of which was really nice. The other one smelled of smoke and had a cracked toilet seat, however the very friendly staff were more than happy to change the room straight away and the second room was lovely. Nice fresh breakfast in the morning and proximity to some great pubs and eateries! Would definitely stay again. ",4,2020,02,18
248,Great stay,Stayed only one night with my girlfriend but enjoyed the stay. Room was clean tidy and comfortable. Vibe of the hotel was nice relaxed and friendly. Bathroom was spotless and the leisure facilities were great quality. Would stay again,5,2020,02,17
248,"Comfortable Stay, Great Service","Good location, really friendly and welcoming team who were super efficient and professional. Nice bar with great service and a really good pint of Guinness.

Rooms comfortable, quiet and well equipped. Bed comfortable and clean. Bathroom and shower super clean with good towels and toiletries.

Room decor a bit dated, but it looks like they are refurbishing?

Breakfast good value and plenty of choice. Service at breakfast was excellent.

Great value for money and a handy (limited) car park.

Would stay again. 

",4,2020,02,12
248,Great hotel,"Stayed here for 6 Nations weekend, group of 10 blokes. Hotel used by organised travel company. Having said that, good quality hotel - friendly, helpful staff, decent sized clean rooms & good quality breakfast (plenty of choice). Location just fine for town & Aviva stadium. Would recommend a stay.",5,2020,02,10
248,Good Hotel,"Stayed two nights over the weekend Friday to Sunday. The hotel is not far from Temple Bar or the AVIVA Stadium. There are plenty of pubs, bars and eateries nearby. 
The staff are friendly and the breakfast staff even more so and very efficient. The breakfast food very good. 
The rooms are well appointed, clean and well sized.  Ours had a bath. They have their own radiators that can be easily controlled for warmth. 
Overall a pleasant stay. ",5,2020,02,09
248,We'll be staying again but not on lower floors ,"A group of us stayed at this hotel last weekend for the six nations. My wife and I had a great experience, really enjoyed the hotel. Our room was well maintained, comfortable and clean. We were on the 6th floor and only having 2 lifts did slow things down a little but this was minor.

Our friends stayed on the 2nd floor. Maybe due to the volume of guests but they found their rooms to be too noisy. In one instance the safe wasn't working  and despite being assured of it being repaired they had to go back to reception on numerous occasions to complain. So book a room in a higher floor.

Having said this the food at the hotel was brilliant. Breakfasts were ample and set you up for the day. I had fish and chips at the bar and it was probably the best I've had for some time. So minor issues, well worth staying at this hotel. My wife and I will be going back again.",5,2020,02,07
248,Six Nations,"We were provided with this hotel for our six nations package. As others have mentioned it is an excellent hotel helped out greatly by the all the staff who were all very friendly and efficient.
The rooms are everything you would expect from a four star hotel in Dublin, spacious and plenty of room for putting cases etc away.
Breakfast was good with a mixture of fruits and cooked breakfast!
Ideally located for the city, and an easy walk to the Aviva stadium.
Only issue was the late opening of the leisure and spa area.
A good choice.

",5,2020,02,03
248,6 Nations,"Fab hotel. Our first room was very noisy at night but the lovely staff very happily moved us & couldn’t have done enough. Lovely rooms, clean, comfy, tidy. The leisure facilities are good and again staff were fab. Great breakfast. Defo be back here. Half hour walk to the Aviva and not to far either  whiskey museum and shops. ",5,2020,02,02
248,Excellent Stay,"Excellent location, good staff, clean well appointed rooms. The hotel is conveniently located with access to all types of transport, eateries etc. The restaurant is very nice and the choice of food is diverse.",5,2020,02,01
248,Weekend break. Dublin,"For the second time have had a great weekend break experience in Dublin in the Camden Court Hotel. Excellent value, great service and great location. Rooms are very clean and comfortable. The hotel staff offer a warm welcome and a good range of food on offer. Generally a great choice of venue to be close to city centre and walking distance to the most popular shopping areas. Will stay again in this hotel. ",5,2020,01,27
248,Girls night,"We had a great night. Hotel lobby and common areas are very well kept and they are very modern and up colourful. We had a triple room and it was big and bright. Location is the best in the city. Plenty of lively bars, clubs, restaurants and only up the road from the best shopping area of Ireland. Very highly recommended ",5,2020,01,27
248,Excellent Experience at Camden Court Hotel,"I stayed at the Camden Court Hotel for 5 days/4 nights. It was a work-related trip. My room was clean and comfortable. The shower was wonderful. The staff was professional and very accommodating. I ate quite a few meals during my stay, including breakfast, lunch, and dinner (one evening). I really enjoyed the lounge/casual dining space, as it allows guests to relax in comfortable seating while enjoying natural light through the numerous windows. I had special food requests, and the restaurant staff was very accommodating to my needs. All of the front desk staff were gracious and efficient. Also, during my stay, I enjoyed a massage in the spa. I was running late from a work-related event, and the spa staff went above and beyond to make sure I was able to get the massage - the massage therapist even stayed a few minutes over/past closing and only charged me for a 45-minute massage instead of the 60-minute massage (since we only had time for the shorter one). This is the best experience I have had; I highly recommend this hotel.",5,2020,01,25
248,Fresh and Ready to Go,I really enjoyed the stay and while on business the experience was excellent. The gym was very good and that means a lot to me when travelling alone. The bar staff were friendly as were all the staff. Great nights sleep and the double window closure kept it very quiet. Very Happy! ,5,2020,01,24
248,Impressed with the quality of this hotel,"Was attending conference in Dublin, chose this hotel based on review and price. Was very impressed by quality of staff, room and food. Everything worked, wifi was decent. The location was central to the business district and will stay here again.",5,2020,01,24
248,Old style hotel with a modern twist - definitely recommended,"Having had to change from my usual accommodation which was full this one came up - and I'm so glad it did.
If you're driving this place has plenty of parking or a city centre hotel
If you're hungry the food is ample and well presented
Breakfast is - well breakfast - it does what it says on the tin
From the great welcome by the reception staff to the bar staff who couldn't be more helpful I'm certainly putting this place on the map for future visits.",4,2020,01,23
248,Great location,We enjoyed a very comfortable stay in this clean hotel. The staff were very friendly and helpful and the service in the bar and restaurant was very good. The hotel is in a great location close to good bars and restaurants. We will definitely return to this hotel in the future.,4,2020,01,21
248,Pleasure,"Clean spacious rooms, delicious breakfast with lots of choice, friendly helpful staff and a  special Thank you to Manager Steve and Receptionist Angelica who went out of their way to make our visit a pleasure.",5,2020,01,20
248,Lovely comfortable hotel in great location,"The staff were warm and welcoming, the room was modern and comfortable, the bathroom and toiletries were fab, and the breakfast was tasty. I'd recommend this hotel to anyone visiting Dublin city centre. The location is fantastic, just off the main shopping street, near multiple great bars and restaurants and right by St. Stephen's Green park.",4,2020,01,19
248,Nosy - Staff didn't care.,"We had stayed here before and had no issue with the hotel but on this occasion we were not impressed. We were attending a show and decided to head back to the hotel early. It was the run up to Christmas and the bars were  very busy. When we got back  to the room we discovered that there was what I imagine was a Christmas party in the room bellow which was causing loud music to be heard in our room. When I say loud I mean you could hear the lyrics perfectly. After an hour of not being able to sleep (Now 12.30 am) I called reception. The man on the phone said. ""There is nothing I can do about it, it will finish at 1am"". Next morning at checkout when asked if the stay was ok we said no and gave the reason and they didn't even try to apologize.  I understand the hotel may want to run a party but It is wrong to charge the full price for a room that you can't actually use it to sleep in because of the noise.  If you want to have a party invest in the proper sound insulation or sell those rooms at a reduced rate. €150 euro (not including breakfast) for a room you can't sleep in. Never again.",1,2020,01,19
248,Not Impressed,Stayed at this hotel last night as had a very early start in Dublin this morning. First of all the room was very stuffy and had a lingering stale smell as did the bed sheets and pillows. Very little sleep due to the noise (even though I was on the 5th floor) there is obviously an issue with the windows as I felt like there was a party In my room. Wouldn’t stay again or recommend to anyone. The reception staff where the only positives for me.,1,2020,01,11
248,"Great pool, great service, great food, great place.",Lovely swimming pool. Loved the Milton Brown toiletries and the big fluffy towels. Really tasty food. Great room service and superb service throughout. The room was always cleaned impeccably and I really enjoyed my stay.,5,2020,01,11
248,Good but could have been better.,"A few minor niggles. Cold room on arrival, leaky iron, corridor ice machine not working but, the staff were friendly and helpful. Very good choices offered for breakfast! Including a fresh comb of honey straight from a hive, impressive! ",3,2020,01,08
248,Great hotel.,"Clean and location was good. No hairdryer at room and quite crowded hotel. Too much noise.

Pool was cold and quite small for so many people. Housekeepers are great but you can hear every sound they make in another chamber at 8 am. Can be stressfull",4,2020,01,07
248,Great stay,"The hotel is close to several interesting locations of Dublin, and the staff of the hotel has always been prompt and kind for any needs or requests.
Very good quality of food (at the bar and at the restaurant of the hotel).",5,2020,01,05
248,Great stay!,"Awesome hotel, great location (approx. 10 min walk to city center), room were spacious and nice and clean, a bit cold and a little noisy from the neighbours but nothing too bad. All staff were very friendly and the breakfast was a pleasant surprise with a wide selection! All in all very pleased with our stay!",5,2020,01,03
248,Very poor service in the bar/reception  Not the staff!!! Management 😳,"My partner and I returned to the hotel after an afternoon exploring Dublin. We decided that we would like something to eat. The hotel restaurant and lobby area were reasonably quiet so we requested a menu and then we had to ASK for someone to take our order and then we ordered two fish and chips. The food was very good but when we finished our meal no one came to clear the table, no one asked if we wanted dessert or if we wanted drinks! We then asked to speak to the manager (BRIAN) his response was he was sorry but we were not Al la Carte!!
Very disappointing for a 4 star hotel - that said - the hotel staff (apart from the totally ineffective manager) were excellent and should be highly commended as they showed professionalism and courtesy all the way.",3,2019,12,27
248,Terrible Customer Service,"We had the worst experience ever when we went to this Hotel for some refreshments ,We had parked in the underground car park and got the lift to reception to see if we could get some tea or coffee ,the receptionist quickly told us we cannot sit at any of the  tables because the hotel does not open until 12 o`clock , he advised us that we could get some tea or coffee somewhere on the street before telling us we cannot sit anywhere in the reception area for a second time,the sad part of all this is I had my mother in law with me who was in a wheel chair and had an oxygen tank on her knees ,we were in the area visiting the undertakers on Camden Street to see her husband that had just passed away and had decided to pop in to the hotel for coffee before bringing her to see him, the receptionist could not get out from behind the desk quick enough to make sure we did not sit at any table ,what an absolute disgrace, Where is the Customer service ,Where is the common sense, Where is peoples kindness , Nobody should treat anyone like this especially pensioner in a wheelchair ,If this is how people are greeted at reception I would hate to see the rest of the Hotel",1,2019,12,27
248,Very Disappointed on this visit,"I have stayed here many times but my most recent trip was so disappointing. When we checked in we were told that the hotel was closing the following morning at 12pm for refurbishment and for Christmas. We had no issue with that, but found it funny that the check out time was also 12pm. Myself and my husband went down to meet my sister and her husband for breakfast the following morning at approximately 10.40am with breakfast due to finish at 11am. On arrival to the breakfast room, we were met by a very rude employee. His duty was as normal, to check what room you were in, see if it was included in the price you paid for your overnight and then direct you to your table if needed. When we arrived at the breakfast room, he asked us what our room number was and we told him. He said that breakfast wasn't included and that if we wanted it, it would cost us €18 each per breakfast. I thought this was very expensive and looked at my husband. I asked my husband what did he think about spending €18 each on breakfast and he said he didn't know. As we were discussing what do you, and I must point out that there was nobody standing behind us in a queue, the rude employee just said ""I have one question - do you want breakfast or not?"". I didn't know what to say and was still looking at my husband. I could see my sister and brother in law waiting for us at their table and said look yes we will go ahead and get breakfast. So we paid the €18 each, which we both thought was extortionate. We were asked then if we wanted tea or coffee and we replied tea. My husband went to get some cereal and I went to get a cooked breakfast. When I got to the counter for the cooked breakfast I was told that there were no sausages, beans or pudding! I asked the man standing there if they were coming out and he said no because they were closing early today. I have to say I was absolutely so annoyed by this, by the fact that not only were we treated rudely but the fact also that we paid €18 each per breakfast - and three of the main items not available. I was highly disgusted. I always stay in the Camden Court when I am in Dublin, and I always book it for myself and my friends that we go with. I have to say that after my last stay, I don't know whether I would stay again. I love the hotel and the people there are normally so friendly. I know that they told us that they were closing early but still feel that if we were being charged the same rate as normal for breakfast, then the same service should be supplied?????",2,2019,12,25
248,Great hotel,"Lovely hotel was sad it closed early on Sunday as would have loved to use the pool again 
Room clean and everything you need
Reception very attentive 
Location not to bad
Pubs nearby were great had a lovely time celebrating my birthday ",5,2019,12,24
248,Fantastic city centre hotel,"The hotel is centrally located with great facilities and a wonderful welcome from the staff. The new suites are stunning, spacious and luxurious, the perfect place to unwind - i would highly recommend a stay in them. ",5,2019,12,23
248,"Top quality, would recommend and will be staying again","Incredible overall, room was perfect, I called reception a number of times and they resolved all questions I had to ask, and they did so in an incredibly polite manner. Restaurant was lovely and food was exquisite.",5,2019,12,23
248,Lovely Hotel,"Lovely Hotel, friendly and warm welcome, decent facilities, clean and cosy rooms, very good breakfast. Only issue we had as a group of 6 was that the baths in the rooms where to shallow, and we are average sized people. ",4,2019,12,17
248,"Excellent hotel, with great rooms and faciltieis","Hands down one of the best hotels we have stayed in!
- great location, lots of cafes, restaurants and bars across the street and pub right next door
- walking distance to Grafton Street, Christchurch and into town
- spotlessly clean rooms and bathrooms
- lovely amenities in room, bottled water, tea and coffee and orla Kiehly toiletries 
- very pleasant staff
- great pool, hot tub, sauna and steam room with good changing facilities and towels included free for guests 
- room itself was very quiet - no noisy aircon which for a light sleeper was just amazing, thought something was wrong it was so quiet (except for some disturbance, see below)
- room was spacious enough for two, huge comfy beds, best pillows and duvet we have had in a hotel room (forgot to check labels but want to order them for ourselves!)

I only marked the hotel down a point for a couple of reasons- one it was so busy with Christmas parties that we weren’t able to use the restaurant for two of our three nights and this wasn’t pointed out at booking. This made the bar very busy too and we found the staff pleasant but too busy also. This also resulted in one very disturbed nights sleep with party guests coming down the corridors singing at the tops of their voices and arguing right outside our room in the middle of the night.  Not the hotels fault, but if the hotel is booked out with party guests the odd check on different floors might be good. We ordered a hot chocolate from the bar which came and had been made with water, it was tasteless and not very good at all, but the bar was too busy to be going back and changing it. Only a really small gripe. 
Second, I felt that the free fitness facilities were great but could do with an upgrade, they are upgrading the hotel (which I found to be fabulous on every level!), and I felt that it was lovely but just a bit grubby, not as clean looking as the hotel itself. The jacuzzi and steam room were packed, one day we were there with people there for parties and for the size of the hotel we found it might be quite small. On a regular visit I think it would be wonderful and it did feel very relaxing overall though. 

All in all one of the best hotels we have ever stayed at, really highly recommended. ",4,2019,12,17
248,Excellent Hotel!,"Overall excellent Hotel. Staff went above and beyond - it was raining when we arrived but the lady on reception gave us an umbrella to use for the duration of our stay (even though we didn't as for one). Hotel very nicely decorated with Christmas decorations and room was spot on with good amenities (tea/coffee etc). Use of the pool/sauna etc was a nice bonus. Location of the hotel is perfect. Camden street is full of great bars and places to eat, Pub next door The Bleeding Horse is great for a nightcap or two. All the main tourist sites (Temple Bar, Castle, Guinness Factory etc) are walking distance from the hotel. Overall cannot recommend enough.",5,2019,12,16
248,Lovely overnight stay,We had a lovely overnight stay with breakfast in the Camden Court Hotel. The double bedroom was comfortable and spotless. Staff pleasant and helpful and the location is great surrounded by pubs and restaurants.,5,2019,12,04
248,Quick trip to Dublin,"I traveled to Dublin with four co-workers for a familiarization trip sponsored by our company.  The hotel was beautifully decorated for Christmas.  When we arrived at 7:30 am, our rooms were, of course, not ready.  The front desk staff was extremely helpful and offered us the showers, in the gym, to freshen up and stored our luggage for us.  We did some touring and came back to the hotel around two in the afternoon.  Our rooms were ready at that time.  Our room was nicely decorated and comfortable (although, the twin bed seemed really small).  The hotel is under going a face lift and our floor was being painted when we were there.  The bathrooms are really in need of an update as they seemed out of place with the rest of the room.  We really enjoyed our stay but I feel I should point out two small complaints.  I do realize it is the holiday season, however, I feel we should have been advised that the restaurant had two parties booked for Friday and Saturday night.  One of our rooms was on the second floor and the noise from the party was pretty annoying at 1:00 in the morning.  I think the front desk could have warned us that the noise might be a problem.  We checked in early enough that I feel we should have been given the option to select a room on a higher floor.  We were told the party on Saturday night would be over by midnight, however, we were in the hotel lobby until around 1:00 am and the party was still going on.  ",4,2019,12,04
248,"Great stay in a lovely,  central hotel.","We had a really nice stay at the Camden Court hotel for the second year in a row.

We ordered light brunch & it arrived in minutes with a smile .
and very good quality & tasty 
All staff very professional ,well trained and a credit to the Hotel ",5,2019,12,02
248,Could be better,"Hotel itself looks so good but staff is all over the floor and to order one coffe you have to wait 20min or go by yourself to order. A bit of improvment would be great because the place looks amazing. Also, I was doing some interviews in hotel and one of the receptionist was just starring at me and talking to oder guy on the reception. Its just not nice to see that in any place but specially in 4*hotel. ",3,2019,12,01
248,Weekend trip,"We can definitely recommend this hotel! 
Great and spacious clean rooms, good service, awesome location.  central, close to everything. 
If anything to improve : the coffeemachine in the breakfast area.
We had a lovely weekend!!",4,2019,11,30
248,Fine discovery,"Fine hotel with helpful service, good bar and resto in the hotel and good location in a lively neighbourhood but without disturbance thanks to the inner court location. On walking distance of Stephen's Green as entrance of the city centre.",4,2019,11,30
248,Avoid this horrible place,"The place is extremely noisy at night so don’t expect to relax here at least till 1 am. 

The staff was not helpful at all. 

The room was stuffy and smelly. 

Camden Court is one of the worst places in Dublin. Just avoid it and get a better hotel in the area.",1,2019,11,29

248,Relaxing hotel in a great neighborhood,"Great service and a lovely hotel in a very great and restaurant/bar dense neighborhood. Loved it! The pool is an extra treat after a long day. Good beds and a very rapid 24 hour room service. The hotel is little bit worn though, and there was some renovating going on but we had a great stay and it did not bother us.",5,2019,11,27
248,Family Trip to Dublin,"Great location, nice and relaxed place to stay but didn't blow me away. There was a party going on in the next room to me but I didn't really mind. Car park was ideal €10 overnight. stayed with the family but we didn't see many families there so unsure if it's widely used for family stays. Our room was a little tight for space. Did request a fridge in my room prior to my trip but this didn't happen on the night. Had stayed here 2 years previous but didn't get the same vibe this time round at the hotel. ",3,2019,11,26
248,James Saunderson,"The hotel was everything that we needed, and the staff at reception were more than helpful, notably Ellio in the bar, a real friendly barman and an asset to your hotel, thank you for a lovely time. We will be back",5,2019,11,24
248,Great location,"I was attending a course here and we had coffees lunch etc provided! 
There was plenty of tea and coffee with delicious biscuits!

",5,2019,11,22
248,As described,"As described in internet, ideal location, lots of restaurants around, good service, good facilities parking and pool. Breakfast was a bit restricted in options but good enough. Totally recommend it for short or long stays.",5,2019,11,22
248,Disappointing as currently undergoing renovation,"Some floors are undergoing renovation & for some reason I was given a room right in the middle of the painting when other floors were not affected, they did move me once asked. Location is great, other than that relatively standard.",3,2019,11,21
248,Excellent stay,"Fantastic as always.  Fresh new look, great atmosphere, friendly and welcoming staff, comfy top quality rooms and facilities.  The bar area allows for relaxation as well as entertaining - TV always on and play the football matches.

248,Pleasant Stay,"We stayed in the hotel over the weekend in early November. Enjoyed our stay. Friendly staff, nice room and decent food. I made use of the swimming pool, steam room and sauna.

248,Fantastic hotel,"Friendly and helpful staff

248,Great hotel in super location,A really great hotel in the heart off Dublin city. Staff were extremely friendly. Would definitely return as it was also good value for money. Room was very spacious and clean. We didn't have breakfast so unable to comment on it. The bar area is very nice.,5,2019,11,12
248,Rude management despite gracious staff,We arrived a little past 2. The staff said there were plenty of rooms available and manager refused to allow us into a room until 3. We were forced to sit with all our luggage for an hour until they were willing to give us a key. Absurd.,1,2019,11,10
248,Great Experience,Excellent stay at the Camden Court.  Staff friendly and efficient and the facilities at the hotel are excellent.  The reasonably priced carpark is a great bonus in the city centre.  The quality of the bedroom was excellent - all facilities working and the rooms were exceptionally clean and well appointed.  The leisure facilities are another bonus whether staying for business or leisure,5,2019,11,07
248,Great location,"Location - Perfect! Bus to/from airport stops directly opposite the hotel, and the tram to/from the City Centre is a short 2 minute walk away.
Rooms - everything you would expect from a 4 star hotel - large TV, tea/coffee maker, lovely toiletries, and an ironing board. The hotel is in a busy area, and there is a lot of noise most of the time. However, we asked for a room on the 6th floor, and were hardly disturbed by any noise.
Staff/Reception area - the reception area is more like a bar, and is great for relaxing in before check in/after check out. You can get drinks and snacks served to you, and watch TV if you are wanting to kill some time.
All in all, I would thoroughly recommend this hotel for a short stay in Dublin. If we are ever in the area again, we would definitely stay here.",5,2019,11,05
248,Nice Hotel,"Nice place with gym, pool and sauna but expensive. The rooms are very confortable, and the bathtube was awesome too. I would say to improve the breakfast, because it was not worthy considering the price of the hotel. And, you don´t need to serve people with hot plates... mainly because the tray didn't fit in the table...",4,2019,11,05
248,Lovely hotel,"The Hotel was lovely,  the staff were so friendly, breakfast was delicious, beds were extremely comfy with no noise at night. The location is great, 1 min walk to the luas or 10 min walk to Stephen green. I would highly recommend.",5,2019,11,05
248,Top Class Hotel,"Drove from Donegal to stay in the Camden Court for a Cher Concert.  
Swift friendly Check In in a  beautifully designed modern lobby. 

Room was huge. Extremely clean and nice city centre decor.  
Plenty mirrors amd lighting for girls doing make up and getting ready to go out.  

Beds were lovely and comfortable with fresh clean new sheets. Larege bathroom again with plenty of mirror and lighting.

 We didnt dine in the hotel that evening as we had reservations elsewhere.  However, I have eaten in the Iveagh Restaurant before and it has been lovely. 

Breakfast buffet, nicely laid out.  Plenty of choice both hot and cold options. Very tasty ...especially sausages and scrambled eggs.   Full Irish and also meats,cheeses etc for your continental option. 
Selections of pastries and croissants being kept warm in a warm lamp display case.  Glass Pots of preserves etc all add luxurious element to the breakfast. Huge selection of fresh whole pieces of fruit. 

Friendly and efficient staff all round hotel who couldnt do enough for you. Lovely friendly lad working the bar that night. 

Fast swift easy check out. 
Plenty of parking, great location.",5,2019,11,03
248,A1,"Sound staff, great location, very clean, massive bed and massive breckfast, will be back.
There was a brilliant lavazza coffee machine in the room. Also a very large smart tv, Great bathroom, brilliant water pressure and the biggest bed i've ever seen. Grand room to rest in after a long journey.
The pool and gym area were great, kept immaculate. The pools a bit small but does the job and the steam room and sauna are class.
Breckfast the next morning was brilliant I recommend paying for it on checking in to save a bit, its a better standard than most hotel breckies.
We didn't stay for dinner but if its anything like the rest of the hotel I'm sure they do a good job.
Will be back",5,2019,11,03
248,Well located hotel with good service,"Good standard hotel, which was ideally suited for participation in the Dublin Marathon.  Well appointed rooms, with nice spa in the basement.  Good breakfast. Helpful staff.  I would certainly visit again. ",5,2019,11,02

248,Nice hotel....bit pricey...staff need some training...,"We stayed at the Camden Court Hotel (Oct. 25-28). First night we were part of tour group - check in easy - room nice.  The next two nights we were on our own - and found it very pricey....yes - it was the Dublin marathon - perhaps that was the reason. Issues for us were the following:  a)  Breakfast:  not presented very well. Cutlery not in buffet line nor on tables - asked a waitress who never brought to us - so we went & picked up off another table that was pre-set.  No milk or cream on table nor in buffet line - again asked a waitress - who picked it up off a table (not sure how long it had been sitting there) and served us.....Suggestion:  leave everything in the line - so we know it's fresh & clean & we can serve ourselves.  b)  WIFI - very spotty - or none whatsoever - hard when we try to research the city...really?  In a city the size of Dublin?  We had better reception in very rural areas of Ireland.  c)  Reception desk:  Angelica - VERY knowledgeable & helpful!  She tried as much as possible to find us a better rate for the Saturday or Sunday and explained reasoning why rates so high.  She answered every quesiton & explained about the shuttle to the airport, distances to various landmarks & answered many questions I had. Thank you Angelica!  Now....Sunday upon checkout....Angelica wasn't there.  A very nice young lady...didn't get her name...(from Spain)....was not knowledgeable (not her fault - perhaps the training she received) -  I questioned her about this 'tax that we can claim' - she knew nothing about it and said 'it's probably like Spain'....I wasn't in Spain & not aware of their protocol...nor interested.  Sorry....I don't expect the hotel to give in depth details - but I would expect they would be 'somewhat aware'..... All in all - a very good location...clean....etc.  Thank you - these tips are only suggested to help - not hurt.",3,2019,10,29
248,"Cold room, high price","Hallway being renovated, fire escape full of building materials, hallway freezing and room not much better, dirty under beds when moved to rearrange 2 sofa beds in family room, poor value for €270 per night",2,2019,10,29
248,Great place to stay in Dublin.,This was a great spot to stay with a great location.  We were close enough to walk to everything but far enough away from the loud areas.  The room was clean and spacious and the bed was very comfortable. We would stay here again.,5,2019,10,27
248,Good location,"2 night stay of the itinerary Brack Tours Enchanted Ireland.   Located on Camden Street, which is near.  St.Stephen's Green. It is also within minutes walk of Dublin's famous shopping area, Grafton Street. Nearby attractions include the National Concert Hall and the Iveagh Gardens.    Room fronting Camden St, no problem with street noises.     Nice evening meal, but  breakfasts no so much.   Self serve choices of limited hot and cold foods.    Morning of departure we were advised coffee only  at 6:30am.   Self serve  instant ""Americano""  was only available choice at that time.  Inner area of dining room had not been cleared of previous night's  service.  Some breakfast littered tables were also seen, but wait staff said  nothing could be served to us.   At 6:45am, waiter delivered pots of lukewarm coffee to the 20 of us  who had been guests in this hotel for 2 days.",3,2019,10,24
248,IRISH ADVENTURE,Great location and very helpful courteous staff. Unfortunately we changed rooms and the pub next door had some noisy patrons- our original room probably wouldn’t have had this problem- oh well it certainly wasn’t enough to fuss about- we never even mentioned it to the staff ,4,2019,10,21
248,Nice hotel,"Very clean hotel.  Staff was very accommodating. Nice breakfast buffet.  We did not pick this hotel as we were doing a self drive tour of Ireland and Scotland through Brennan Tours.  However, if we go back to Dublin we would stay at this hotel again.",5,2019,10,19
248,Wonderful hotel,"This is a very nice hotel.  It is in a great location.  The rooms are nice and spacious and the beds very comfortable.
It is a very nice and comfortable lobby.  We had breakfast included in our rate.  There was a very good selection of items and they were all good.
I would stay again if we were to back to Dublin",4,2019,10,18
248,A Very Nice Hotel,We stayed at the Camden Court for our Road Scholar program.  We had extended our stay in Dublin for two more days and also  then extended our stay for two more nights at the Camden Court.  It is a vey nice hotel and they have a very good breakfast.  It was pretty handy to the things we wanted to see and do in Dublin although we did end up doing a fair amount of walking.  Definately a nice place to stay.,5,2019,10,18

248,Great place to stay,"Stayed here on our first night in Ireland before heading out to the Dingle Peninsula. Enjoyed our stay very much. Didn't get any food from the restaurant or the breakfast here, so I can't speak to that. The gym and pool area were great. So nice to relax in the steam room and hot tub, and take a dip in the pool. Very clean. Room was great--comfortable bed. Had a fan in the room, which is a bonus for me! Within walking distance to so much! Came back to Dublin a week later and stayed in a different area that we didn't enjoy nearly as much. The regular parking area was full, so we did the underground lot for 10 euros for the overnight--still very convenient. Would stay again!",5,2019,10,14
248,A Dublin find,"This was a wonderful hotel. The location was convenient for walking to central Dublin, the rooms were spacious and very nice and there was a pool, sauna and steam room!

248,Great hotel,"We had a great experience at the Camden Court Hotel. We accidentally tried to check in a day early, and Arek was so accommodating- he found us a room, and even threw in breakfast the next day. We had been traveling all day, so it was really nice not to have to find a new hotel on short notice. Breakfast was really nice- they have a full Irish breakfast, and the rooms were clean and well maintained.",5,2019,10,12
248,Wonderful experience,Great place to stay! Close to city Center and activities. Lots of great amenities. Old world charm with modern conveniences and great staff. Breakfast buffet was amazing! Would  recommend Camden Court to anyone!,5,2019,10,10

248,"Great rooms and breakfast, not so good noise insulation","Really enjoyed the stay in the hotel. The room was nice with a safe, TV, coffee machine, water heater, and free water bottle. The Wifi was also working well, and the breakfast was really enjoyable. The only problem was the noise insulation of the room door as voices in the corridor were well audible.",4,2019,10,06
248,Standard hotel. It is not worth the price.,"Very good position and the airlink bus from/to the airport.
The bathroom is to small, the hall shlould be clean more frequently.
The breakfast is good, but it is a little bit expensive compare to other solutions you can find nearby.",3,2019,10,02

248,August bank holiday weekend stay ,"Stayed here for 2 nights in August.

Easy to get to from Dublin Airport. Hotel staff were really helpful in directing me which bus to catch via contact with them e-mail. Bus stop (last stop on the line) is right opposite the hotel. 

Located in the south of the city, I booked this hotel for the convenience of the Gaiety Theatre, which is about a 15 minute walk. St Stephens Park is about 10 minutes and the famous Temple Bar is around 25 minutes walk. It’s not the closest to the main attractions, but is definitely close enough to walk, if you’re fit and healthy. 

Breakfast not included, so can’t comment on this unfortunately. There’s a small Tesco nearby and walkable distance to cafes.

Room was clean and comfortable. Check in staff were fine. 

Had a good stay. ",4,2019,09,28
248,Very convenient and excellent food,For a quick overnight stay this hotel was ideal. The Hotel was at the end of the bus line and only steps away. We went to the Bleeding Heart Pub right next door after spending the afternoon walking through St Stephens Green and nearby sights. Great breakfast the next day before we took the Bus back to the airport to meet our tour.,4,2019,09,28
248,"Handy for location, If you want air con go elsewhere","Reception and checking in was a frenzy, very rushed and very stressed looking staff.

Lounge bar area was spacious and as private as you wanted to be",3,2019,09,28
248,Great Hotel & Location,"Busy hotel, but check-in was quick, staff very friendly.

248,Average hotel with poor service,"I have stayed at the Camden Court on several occasions and the service is not responsive to the needs of their clients. I had an issue with wifi (along with a wifi) which they would not resolve until multiple complaints. Then I had an issue with a short fuse and an iron blew up and then a light flickered on an off when my computer was plugged into this power point. No apology for the front desk. 
The location is good the rooms average the help non existent!",3,2019,09,24
248,Good hotel in a good location,"We have stayed in the Camden Court several times and find it very suitable for our needs. We are a family of 4 (2 adults and 2 children) and find the family rooms to be reasonably spacious and good value for money for Dublin. The hotel is located on Camden Street which is not the grandest address in South Dublin but it is only 10 minutes walk to Stephens Green and is close to the Luas tram on Harcourt Street. Most of the points of interest in the South of the city are easily within walking distance.

The hotel lobby, restaurant and bar are all quite nice and there is ample comfortable seating if you wish to relax. On our most recent visit check in and check out was very easy and quick and the hotel staff was friendly and helpful. 

The leisure complex has a decent pool with sauna, steam room, jacuzzi and fitness suite. This area along with some of the hotel corridors could do with a refresh at some point as they are starting to show signs of aging and wear and tear.

If you are driving there is a great underground car park with easy access to rooms, lobby and the leisure complex.

Around the hotel within walking distance or a short taxi ride away there are plenty of good options for food and drinks.

Some reviews mention that the area can be noisy at weekends. Our last visit was on a Saturday night and we had a room facing the main street. We were in bed sleeping by 11pm and we were not disturbed by any noise from the street. The room had quadruple glazing which keep any noise to a minimum. 

If you are looking for 5 star luxury then you might be better trying The Westbury, The Shelbourne or The Merrion but you will pay accordingly. 
But if you are looking for a good base in South Dublin that is reasonably well located then Camden Court is a good option.",4,2019,09,22
248,Lunch ,"This is a really relaxing place to go for a  quiet lunch or just a coffee or drink with friends or on your own,, great service and lovely surroundings,, food is very good and nice selection on the menu.",5,2019,09,22

248,Do not stay here on a Friday or Saturday!,"Overall the hotel was very nice. From 1am to 5am on Friday and Saturday there is no sleep to be had, the hotel is in the middle of many bars and nightclubs. Drunken screaming all night horns blaring from drunks walking in the streets, police sirens trying to keep the drunks moving. No rooms have no ac tried closing the windows, didn’t do anything to deaden the sound and the rooms heated up fast ",3,2019,09,18
248,Great hotel and Location,"Loved the the breakfast. Hotel close by red/green line connector. However walking distance to a lot of local stops. If you are wanting/willing to walk. But Dublin is a city to walk in!!

Next to a great pub- Bleeding Horse. 

Rooms were clean, staff was fantastic.",5,2019,09,18

248,"Clean, central hotel","We spent 2 nights here and really enjoyed it. The hotel is clean throughout, has a decent lobby bar and a great free (for guests) gym and spa area (with pool, sauna, jacuzzi and steam room). Rooms are not huge, but a decent size for 2 people. Bed was comfortable and the room we got was facing the internal car park and was very quiet. Bathroom was a little pokey and smelly, hence the rating of 4 and not 5 stars. Location is great: 5 mins walk to St Stephens Green, 20 mins to Temple Bar and the Liffey, there is also a LUAS stop just outside the hotel, as well as a stop for the Air Link bus to the airport. Service was friendly and efficient throughout and the price was great for the location. Would definitely stay here again.",4,2019,09,15
248,Outstanding hotel,We stayed twice at the Camden Court hotel.  The people working there are really amazing and very well trained.  The staff in the restaurant were especially pleasant and tried to make our requests happen.  Rooms are ok. Location is great.  I recommend this hotel. ,5,2019,09,12
248,Fantastic experience!,Really nice modern hotel. Surrounded by loads of cool bars and restaurants. Great location with a short walk into town. Well worth paying that little bit extra for the luxury. Will definitely be back soon!,5,2019,09,10
248,Thin walls.....,"Two night business stay. Good location - close to main roads into  city plus the main centre. 

Friendly staff throughout hotel. Onsite parking was especially useful & reasonable priced.

Comfortable room although the shower was little more than a dribble. Good selection of food available at breakfast.

Slight downside was the thin walls. We could hear the couple next door having a good time at various points throughout the night....

248,Lovely hotel great location and quiet,"We spent two nights at the hotel and were absolutely delighted from the moment we walked in.
Lovely light tasteful decor in the reception and foyer area. Great room with lovely toiletries I would happily buy them for home use
I used the gym no TV’s to connect to on the running machines but I was prepared with my music and headphones. 
Great choice at breakfast and we also had teas and coffees in reception.
Only shame was when we wanted to book for further nights the Saturday was full so had to go somewhere else ",5,2019,09,07
248,Our stay at Camden court hotel.,"On the 24th of aug I brought my niece here for a girlie night for her 8th birthday. From the moment we got there the staff were amazing. A lovely guy called Arek checked us in. He was such a friendly helpful guy. Our room was amazing, clean and so comfortable. We went for  dinner in the hotel and there were 2 waitresses. Alaxandra and unfortunately I didn’t get the other girls name. They made my niece feel so special. They brought out her dessert with candles lit in it, happy birthday wrote in chocolate and sang happy birthday. She could not have been happier. Then the manager Shubam gave her a lovely princess pack with chocolates and a picture to colour and other goodies. I can not fault this hotel. The food is just to die for. ESP the chicken wings. When leaving Arek and a lovely girl called Marcelie checked us out. I totally recommend the Camden court hotel for any occasion. They really made my nieces birthday. Because of the amazing staff she said it was the birthday ever and I am the best Aunty. We will definitely be back.",5,2019,09,05
248,My stay at the Camden Court,"Only one complaint, I'd like a thinner pillow to sleep on, all four were very plump.  Also although a quiet room was given to me there was a noise filtering up to my room, like the heating system, but I got over it with ear plugs. ",4,2019,09,05
248,Short but nice,"Only 1 night stay but great location, facilities and rooms. Hotel staff where very professional and friendly. Room was very clean and good size. Location very near to city centre and close to transport links. ",5,2019,09,02
248,Camden Court Hotel,"We were very happy with the hotel. Room was lovely , comfortable bed, tea and coffee making facilities, TV with a decent selection of channels and a safe . Breakfast was great with a varied choice of food . We had an evening meal in the bar which was very good also. Parking was on site at 10 euro per 24 hours . All in all 100 percent happy and highly recommend. We will be back.",5,2019,09,01
248,Great Service,"I have stayed with Camden Court on numerous occasions now through work and I would definitely recommend the hotel.

The Staff are friendly and the hotel is lovely.  If I had a query there was always someone on hand to help.  

The reception area is a very nice place to sit of an evening when traveling with colleagues. ",5,2019,08,30
248,So disappointed....,"As a EMEIA business manager I frequently travel for business, but this trip was undertaken in a personal capacity with my daughter. Selling factors were pool/leisure facilities and parking availability. Unfortunately our experience of the pool/leisure facilities was AWFUL...we were greeted by a hostile employee when we went to use pool at 11.30am on Saturday morning. Transpired that this person was in middle of deep cleaning the area with an industrial steam/power cleaner, and we were disturbing this process. Other guest also entered the area subsequently, however, this did not prevent this person from using the loud industrial cleaner, and blasting her personal heavy metal music on her phone while doing so, for the next HOUR. I gave up the 'relaxing' leisure facilities that I had paid dearly for after an hour, as I was developing a terrible headache from the noise. Despite raising this with the senior hotel manager on duty on Sunday, I was fobbed off with a cheap gesture, the whole experience ruined this long planned birthday trip for my daughter and I....VERY disappointed, as it is a lovely hotel, and has great potential.",1,2019,08,27
248,Great hotel! We got engaged here! ,"Lovely hotel. Visited three years ago for my best friends hen do, and we returned as a group of couples again this weekend for a friend’s birthday. Staff are lovely. Rooms are clean and comfortable. We got engaged this weekend in the hotel, so the hotel now holds even more lovely memories for us! Would highly recommend! ",5,2019,08,26
248,Good stay!,"Happy with overall stay! Staff were very helpful and friendly. Food was fab and location is great for rds arena. Swimming pool/spa area was very relaxing, they could have done with a water dispenser but apart from this it was brill!",4,2019,08,24
248,Highly recommend ,"We are just back from an amazing few days in the Camden court firstly the secure car park was amazing no need to worry about the car  the staff landed with toys for the kids to play with while we stayed amazing Netflix was a huge hit to keep kids entertained for a while  room was very spacious airy and cot was clean and snug beds were so comfy and huge lavazza coffee was a hit in the room 
The shampoos and conditioners were beautiful 
The staff in the leisure center were so helpful and friendly had more toys for kids there ☺️ peter was very friendly and helpful 
We had dinner in the bar the first night it was beautiful very friendly waiter  over all it was fantastic 
The only tiny  thing I would say for our 15 month  old the high chairs weren’t secure enough the wooden ones!!we brought the buggy for breakfast as he’s a climber and the straps weren’t secure enough but in fairness it’s not even worth complaining about we will for sure be back ",5,2019,08,22
248,"Disappointed - overpriced, and room stuffy and noisy","Bad choice of hotel: the room was small, stuffy and noisy, and considering the price I paid, overpriced, even for Dublin. The hotel staff is polite but not particularly welcoming. More should be done to make individual guests feel welcome.",2,2019,08,21
248,Camden Court Hotel,"The hotel is easy to find, very centrally located. We popped into the city for some shopping and it only took us approx. 15mins to walk to Grafton Street.  Parking at the hotel was not a problem. Check in was very efficient & friendly. We even received a complimentary upgrade to a suite which was fabulous. Dinner in the restaurant was lovely. We ordered cocktails from the bar and they were delicious - Unfortunately we didn't get to use the swimming pool -which means we will have to come to test that out. We are very much looking forward to returning to the Camden Court HotelThank you for a wonderful stay! ",5,2019,08,20
248,Fabulous!!! ,I booked this hotel pretty last minute cause the online photos looked very impressive. I’m glad I cancelled my other hotel for this one. It was pretty far out in Dublin for what I was visiting for but this is no issue. It is close to tram stops etc... the wow factor greets you at the open and impressive reception area. The room was well decorated and finished to a high standard. The main positive was that it actually looked exactly like the pictures which I find is a rare occasion these days. A smart TV so you can access Netflix etc and a Lavazza coffee machine are 2 wonderful extras you get. An impression fitness centre and swimming pool was also accessible for guests. Breakfast was buffet style offering both continental and cooked. All staff that I came across were friendly and went the extra mile to help. The only niggle I have about this hotel is the lack of air conditioning in the rooms. But with windows that open wide and a fan in the room this wasn’t so much of an issue. Thanks again for a very pleasant stay...! ,5,2019,08,18
248,Calm and quiet hotel in the heart of Dublin ,"Our four-day stay at the hotel was relaxing. The rooms are nice and so is the bathroom. Spacious enough for two. The Camden Court also has a swimming pool, a sauna and a steam room. This was a major plus for us! On Tuesdays and Thursdays they even have an aqua aerobics class from 7:00 - 7:45 pm with local residents and we were welcome to join. The staff members we dealt with were really nice. 

The hotel is at walking distance from St, Stephen’s Green, a lovely park. 

Our only criticism was that the room was very warm and stuffy. They couldn’t fix that but we kept the window open overnight. Fortunately the sound of traffic is far away as most rooms face the back of the building. The seagulls were the loudest sound we heard. Overall, we recommend this hotel. ",4,2019,08,17
248,Great rooms,The Camden court holds beautiful rooms with an excellent service. There are lots of places to go nearby and the lobby in particular is beautiful. The televisions are big and the bathrooms are clean. They also have some good food.,5,2019,08,14
248,Great Stay,"We did a ton of research before picking the Camden Court Hotel and it was worth it. Although it was not one of the main hotels mentioned for Dublin, I would rate it a 4 star experience. It was so centrally located that we were able to walk almost everywhere from here. So close to the heart of Dublin--yet far enough away to get a good night's sleep (quiet). Spacious lobby, good food, friendly staff, pool, sauna, work-out room--what else could you ask for. When I go back to Dublin--this is my 1st choice.",5,2019,08,12
248,Fabulous,"Just back from a 2 night stay. Couldn't reccomend this hotel highly enough. The staff, food, room and pool all top class. Hard to find a hotel that caters for a family of 5 comfortably.
Quadruble glazing in the rooms was amazing. Everyone slept like lords. ",5,2019,08,11
248,No complaints,"Staff were very pleasant in reception, we were upgraded to a suite as it was our anniversary. Room was spotless and well laid out. Facilities were perfect. Breakfast choice was plentful and good quality. Man serving  hot food was rude and not like any of the other staff who were helpful and eager to please",5,2019,08,11
248,Lovely hotel,"Great city  centre location. Only stayed 1 night and didn't have breakfast so cannot comment on food, although the restaurant did look lovely. Bedroom.was very spacious as we were given a family room for 2 people. Would stay here again if I return to Dublin in the future",4,2019,08,11
248,Great service,In total we will have stayed 4 nights at the Camden.  My husband and I planned a one week family trip for 11 people for the first week.  We were on our own for the 2nd week and decided to stay at the same hotel.  This was mainly because they were incredibly accommodating with our families.  We arrived early and they worked hard to get us all in rooms so we could rest.  Further one was a family of 5 and they had a room that was comfortable for them.  There is a great swimming pool and exercise room.  The breakfast met everyone's palate.  I can't say enough good things.,5,2019,08,08
248,Reasonable...,"We arrived at this hotel as part of a group tour in Ireland.
The room was comfortable and clean but not very modern. We also did not hear much noise at night so we slept well while we were there.
The worst part of our stay was breakfast. The breakfast in this hotel is incomplete, and full of people at the same time in the same room. The food that they provide does not have variety and it is not what is expected of a hotel like that in the city center of Dublin. 
I have to say that the hotel is near the city center, most of the attractions and restaurants, but many more hotels are in the same conditions,probably with similar prices to this one, and of course better.
To finish I have to say that the people that work there are nice and were always very kind to us, as well as concern in assisting us with anything we need.",3,2019,08,08
248,Old-fashioned hotel with too many groups,"Pros: near the center of Dublin, manager was quite helpful to solve the problem described below

Cons: too crowded, outdated look, breakfast with almost no options and too crowded, room too hot with no A/C, and general confusion caused the hotel to give me a room key for a room that was already occupied",2,2019,08,08
248,Girls nite out,Myself and 12 girls stayed here for the westlife concert the staff were amazing the rooms were very spacious. The one thing we loved the ice machine on the landing was perfect for the next morning. Will definitely be back to stay here.,5,2019,08,08
248,Camden court,"Location of hotel is very good, leisure center is like walking back in time very dated, waiters very slow to clear table at breakfast our table had a stack of dishes in the middle of the table, no one asked us for tea and coffee, overall average, also it says parking available which you also have to pay for it does not say that anywhere when booking.",2,2019,08,05
248,Average ,"Rooms could be cleaner see picture 
of the light switch... no mini bar, night front desk staff wasn't friendly. On the positive side Good location, good breakfast fresh squeeze OJ, espresso and food was good
Room is spacious king size bed, mattress was average overall ",3,2019,08,04
248,Great stay!,"The room was clean and comfortable, and the service was excellent.  The location was out of the way  of crowds and noise but close enough to shopping and tourist sites that it was easy to walk or hop a bus or take short taxi rides.",5,2019,08,02
248,Had an excellent 3 days at Camden Court Hotel,"The staff was extremely helpful, polite and friendly.  The room was clean and roomy.  Room had a safe, blowdrier, iron, oscillating fan stored in closet, capuccino maker and a water heating electric pot, along with coffee pods and teabags.  No USB ports.  I wish I had gone to check out the pool and jacuzzi sooner, because we could have used it after the long daysof walking!  Very centrally located, 15 min to 20 min walk from everything.  The hotel restaurant had very good food, but a little pricey.",5,2019,07,31
248,Three day break,"My daughter and I had a few days in Dublin and really enjoyed our first stay in the Camden Court Hotel. The location was central to all places we wanted to go to. The staff were very polite, helpful and very welcoming. ",5,2019,07,29
248,2 night stay ,"The hotel is a wonderful place to stay, clean rooms, friendly staff, easy to get into the centre of Dublin via bus. Ours was a last minute booking and we couldn’t fault the hotel, I would recommend staying here.",5,2019,07,28
248,Great Value!,Clean comfortable and well appointed rooms for a decent price!  A bit out of the way from the main attractions of Dublin but if you don't mind a quick half mile walk every day - it's PERFECT!  Would stay again without hesitation.,4,2019,07,26
248,BEST FITNESS PLACE EVER,"The staff and pool and everything is WONDERFUL. 
I would definitely recommend this place for others. The swimming pool is so nice and relaxing and I think the jacuzzi and sauna is really relaxing the fitness room looks really nice too with treadmills weights and more",5,2019,07,25
248,Nice hotel but expensive,We stayed for one night due to our original hotel still being built. Would love to stay again sometime but it's a bit expensive and didn't even include breakfast. The room was a decent size and modern. Staff were pleasant and helpful.The bus stop for the public bus service to the airport was right outside the hotel and takes around 40 minutes. ,4,2019,07,24
248,Very comforatble Hotel Cafe for a late night coffee,"After dinner, on our way 'home' we passed the Camden Court Hotel - looked very nice indeed. 
   The cafe in the foyer was open and we enjoyed coffee and cake in the very comfortable chairs served to us while we relaxed after a big day exploring Dublin.",4,2019,07,22
248,June 2019,Excellent place to stay in Dublin.  Centrally located.  Beautiful hotel with great amenities.  Dorian and Arek at the front desk are standouts!  Dorian took incredible care of us on our anniversary trip.  Rooms are spacious and updated. Breakfast in the restaurant was great.  Would definitely stay at Camden Court again.,5,2019,07,22
248,A FOUR STAR HOTEL??? FAR FROM IT!!!!,"Upon arrival we were greeted by a nice gentleman at the reception desk, he was very personable throughout the check-in and once it was completed dropped the first bomb that the wifi was out... traveling from the US it's key to have wifi during your stay... strike one.... we then took the elevator which had a carpeted floor that was very dirty up to our room... walking in we were greeted with a musty, stale, dirty smell with a VERY outdated room... no artwork, no character, just a bed, desk chair and a tv.... strike two.... we then tried to put the air conditioning on since the room was so stale... they do not have air conditioning... they offer a dirty, dusty fan to ""cool"" your room off... strike three..... Maybe I am to blame for not checking on the air conditioning situation however they do not market this very important feature ANYWHERE!!! Next up the bed... which is all of a couple inches thick and uncomfortable, you're basically sleeping on coils.... and our bed was two beds put together so there was a giant gap in the middle, awful... strike four... thankfully we only stayed for one night, but it was not how we expected to spend our last night in Dublin to say the least... I will say the location is good you are near a lot of great pubs and restaurants but the hotel is very underwhelming... there are plenty of other nicer, updated, cleaner hotels to stay at... do not waste your money or time here.",1,2019,07,22
248,Comfortable Dublin hotel,"It seems that this hotel is popular with group tours.  There were several groups there during our stay.

It was pretty hot when we were in Dublin, and our room at this hotel proved to be warm and stuffy.  I don’t think that there is air conditioning in the guest rooms, but they provided a fan which helped a bit.  The room was large, and the bed was comfortable and offered firm pillows.  The WiFi signal was strong throughout the hotel.  The staff were all very friendly.  We enjoyed the included buffet breakfast.  Free bottled water was provided daily.

The major sights are a fairly long walk from the hotel, although St. Patrick’s Cathedral was only about 30 minutes away.  St. Stephen’s Green is delightful and nearby.",4,2019,07,22
248,Friendly mid range hotel,"Stayed at this hotel on business for a few nights while in Dublin.  The hotel is clean and comfortable and easy to find.  The breakfast buffet is pretty good too.

The only downside is that it doesn't have aircon in the rooms and the road outside was too noisy to leave the window open overnight.  It would have been nice if, considering the weather at the time, they had noted on checkin that there was a fan in the bottom of the wardrobe.",4,2019,07,21
248,Friendly First Class Hotel,"Stayed here for 3 nights with family and friends. We had such a lovely experience first time in Dublin. The Irish are so friendly and that stretches to the hotel staff. Hotel lovely and clean, comfortable beds and great breakfast. The hotel has an indoor swimming pool, sauna and steam room which was so nice to get up to in the mornings. They had a gym but we didn’t use that. All brilliant.",5,2019,07,18
248,"excellent location, a bit pricey","this hotel is a great place to stay for people who are either here for business purposes or on vacation. Due to its central location you have several shops, restaurants and bars just in walking distance, with many sightseeing spots around the area. Rooms are big and clean, although the walls are rather thin and the general hotel area a bit old, it didn't bother me much. ",5,2019,07,18
248,VERY NICE!,"The main things I look for in a hotel include cleanliness, safety of the neighborhood, quiet location, and close proximity to attractions.  This hotel checked all the boxes.  The rooms were clean, the bathroom was clean, the beds were comfy and the hotel was within walking distance to things to do.  Win win!",4,2019,07,17
248,Great stay,"Lovely clean, quiet room
Excellent location 
Stayed here as attending a gig in iveagh gardens...perfect location for it
Excellent staff on check in..v pleasant
Lifts could b bit quicker
Yummy coffee in reception 
",5,2019,07,16
248,A let down,"An uncomfortable bed, a warm room and very noisy all night due to generator or air conditioning fan switching on and off all night ( not ours we didn’t have it ).The location was perfect and the foyer was very nice .",2,2019,07,16
248,Decent Dublin hotel,"Stayed here 2 nights as part of our Ireland tour. Staff is very friendly and most helpful. Swimming pool and hot tub very good but I found the chlorine in the enclosed area a bit overwhelming for my eyes after about 10min. Hotel is conveniently located especially because the Luas (light rail) is only a block away. Rooms are ok but no air conditioning and so in mid-July we had to leave our window open all night. That would be ok if not for the seagulls crying all night, or the drunks at 4am. Breakfast as others have mentioned was quite good, though it is a buffet. ",4,2019,07,16
248,Great location in Dublin!,"The hotel is perfectly located; we walked everywhere we wanted to go. The rooms were nice and the staff was excellent. We accidentally let the battery in our car go dead and they were most helpful in getting us on our way when we needed to depart. We were not quite as impressed by breakfast as we hoped to be, but we would stay there again when in Dublin. We were happy to learn that they had an area to park that didn't require us to walk far to gain entrance to the hotel.",4,2019,07,14
248,Excellent staff,"I visited Camden Court recently for a business meeting and was pleasantly surprised at the level of service in the hotel lobby. Our server Rachael was excellent, so attentive. The ambience was perfect for a business meeting. I have not stayed in the hotel as a guest but I will definitely be returning for meetings",5,2019,07,14
248,Yet to be beaten,"I rate this place as one of the best hotels in the UK/Ireland - have stayed here on and off for the last 6 months or so. The courtyard is an impressive entry point, and leads on to a well lit, inviting reception area. I've never had to wait for more than a couple of minutes and every member of staff is friendly, courteous and helpful. 

The rooms are of a decent size, well fitted and spotlessly clean. Big comfortable beds and a good shower! My personal favourite is the smart TVs, a very useful and unique touch which is a lifesaver. Being able to access Netflix/Amazon video etc on a large, high quality screen directly is a godsend.

The bar is well stocked, well staffed and a pretty pleasant place to chill out for a couple of hours. They show all the sports if requested. I've never eaten in the restaurant but the food at the bar is reasonably priced and definitely passable. The only complaint I'd have is that the bar closes far too early at 10:30pm - the Bleeding Horse is next door which is open late but surprising that a hotel bar shuts so early.

Breakfast is served in the restaurant area which is absolutely massive, you soon see why when you see the amount of people in there most days at 8am! Big range of the usual hot Irish breakfast items, cereals, yoghurts etc. The hot food is not self service which can lead to a bit of a bottleneck in the morning, but difficult to see how that could be avoided.

All in all, one of my favourite places to stay in Dublin. I genuinely struggle to think of any negatives here. See you soon 😁",5,2019,07,14
248,Good all round hotel,"We were in Dublin for a concert last weekend and stayed one night in the Camden court. It is a good hotel if you are looking a reasonably central base in Dublin , in terms of value for money or Dublin hotels it was ok (value for money in Dublin hotels is hard to come by at the minute but especially when there are major concerts on ) . The reception staff were very pleasant and courteous and the room was clean and comfortable . We had  a meal in the bar when we arrived and were very impressed (again the staff here were excellent)",4,2019,07,12
248,Great Stay,"Customer service top notch. Would definitely recommend this hotel to my family and friends.  It’s in a great location close to a park, Trinity College, and a shopping center.  Very clean.  I would also recommend the Full Irish breakfast. ",5,2019,07,12
248,Good centrally located hotel in city centre,"Colourful, welcoming lounge greets you as you enter the hotel. Located extremely conveniently opposite bus stop where buses run from the airport. Trams run very nearby too, but hotel is situated within a pleasant walk into the town centre via St Stephen’s green.
 Efficient staff, pleasant rooms, decent gym, large indoor pool and plentiful breakfast all enhanced our 2 night stay.",5,2019,07,12
248,Excellent Hotel,"We were booked into a family room (which was not listed on the website but I emailed them and they responded with a great rate).  The room was large and beds comfortable.  It had a small fridge and they provided a microwave since we had 3 little ones with us.  The location is excellent as well.  Walking distance to St. Stephen's Green/Grafton St.

The Airlink 757 from the airport stops right outside.  And the Bleeding Horse pub is connected.

The staff was so nice and helpful even when they were busy!  

Would definitely stay there again.",5,2019,07,11
248,One Night B&B,"Hotel location is fantastic, well placed for reaching all the main venues and streets in Dublin.  Modern and clean hotel.  Staff are simply wonderful.  Underground parking available.  Will stay again in the future.",5,2019,07,09
248,Excellent stay in city centre hotel,"Stayed again in the Camden Court.  It is our go to hotel in Dublin for its location beside the Luas and that you can walk to city centre if you want.  Hotel is spotless, rooms are just right. Reception team very pleasant and helpfull.I would have no hesitation reccommending The Camden Court Hotel.",5,2019,07,08
248,"Good location, friendly and helpful staff","Overall a pleasant stay. 
Reception staff  were very helpful.  
Great beds and a good nights sleep on the quiet side of the hotel. 
The breakfast was so so. The cereals were pretty poor and the cooked food was mediocre (eggs not properly cooked)
But I would go back. 
",4,2019,07,07
248,"Staff is the best - plus rooms, restaurants and gym","I am an event planner from Brazil and I was at Camden Court with an incentive travel group in March 2019. 
I can say without fear that Camden Court staff did the difference and made my days much easier and smooth during the event. Always helpful, always professional and available for what was needed. I need to especifically thanks to Mr. Dorian, Mr. Pavel and Mr. Nasir. Thank you again gentlemen!
About the hotel as general, I can say that rooms are confortable despite it is not big - juist as the european standard. I found all in-room amenities needed. Breakfast is good and I was happy to find different kinds of bread and hot milk, that is a must for brazilians The lobby bar has good light options for lunch or snacks. The gym is quite complete, with a good variety of equipments.",5,2019,07,03
248,Nice hotel bu a little away from most attractions in Dublin.,"Hotel is modern and clean.  My room was large, but sparsely furnished.  It had a comfortable chair for sitting but no lamp or table.  The room was dark since it only had one small window.  The hotel has a good restaurant which serves an excellent Irish breakfast in the morning.  In the evening it converts to an upscale restaurant that has excellent food and service, but is a bit pricey.  Hotel staff are pleasant and helpful.",4,2019,07,02
248,"Good hotel, nice location but somewhat expensive breakfast","Good hotel, albeit the rooms are a bit small, beds good, staff nice. 
Nice location buses stop just around the corner also the airport shuttle and the LUAS as well 
Somewhat expensive breakfast  17 EUR for breakfast is a bit too much ",4,2019,07,02
248,Great place!,"Nice hotel at a competitive price, from the reservations agent who I emailed, to the front desk personnel I met...a great group, couldn't be more friendly or helpful! Location is handy to the Dublin sites but in a quiet area. ",5,2019,07,01
248,Wonderful stay!,"Do yourself a favor and stay here! This is my second time staying at the Camden Court Hotel. Incredible location, amazing pool, and wonderful service. They even helped book a doctor's appointment for me when I got sick and sent a feel better note and chocolates and fruit up when I returned. Would highly recommend. ",5,2019,07,01
248,Disappointing hot breakfast size servings,"Stayed 3 nights and had read about very small hot breakfast size servings. This is true. A (really) silly policy because low carb people will then load up on smoked salmon and cheese (self serve) and others load up on the pastries and other stuff that is self serve. Why upset customers over a piece of bacon? The hotel is not particularly well maintained with the ice machine on level 2 not working (but ice available on level 3 and the plug in our basin didn’t work. If you ran the tap fast enough you could build up enough water in the basin albeit contaminated from reverse flow. An employee entered our room without knocking while my wife was compromised. On a positive note the gym, pools, spa, sauna etc is nice. Need a longer sighted approach Management.",3,2019,07,01
248,good hotel,"Good choice. I would only improve the lighting in the rooms. It was very dark. Other than that, the people are very kind and friendly. The location was OK for me, between the city center and the place where I had my meetings",4,2019,06,29
248,Great location and very clean,"Good value, spacious rooms and lovely spa area! Stayed with 2 friends in the family room and it was very good value. 
Great location on Camden St near lots of busy bars and restaurants.. short walk into city center ",4,2019,06,25
248,Great stay ,"I stayed for 8 very relaxing nights, I couldn’t fault this hotel if I tried. Buffet breakfast every morning was a highlight for me and a nice hot bath in the late evening to unwind topped off with a glass of bubbles was just heavenly.  Thanks

",5,2019,06,22
248,We stayed for 8 nights and like it.,We had a superior double which was comfortable. Lots of hot water and big bathtub. Good breakfast and convenient to walk all over Dublin on the south side. Close to St. Stephens Green and Grafton St. Bed was a bit firm but we finally got use to the hard pillows otherwise an excellent stay.,4,2019,06,22
248,Great Room,"Hotel is in a good location and when we checked in the staff were very helpful in explaining room location and amenities that the hotel provides including a pool, sauna and fitness room was are included in price. The room we got was big airy and bed was great and the bathroom was a good size with bath and a shower. The cooked breakfast was a bit of a let down considering the charge of 13 euros each which we paid on arrival. The bacon was over cooked scrambled egg left a pool of water on my plate which ruined most of my food. The staff member serving the food was a bit unapprochable by not being overly friendly towards us and more or less not giving us an open option of what we wanted and how many of each item we wanted on our plates and it did seem she was calculating the food she had and how many tables were left to come down to eat and maybe this was why. Rating on room and stay very good but breakfast was poor.",4,2019,06,20
248,Nice stay,Good quality hotel with nice facilities in excellent location. Got early checkin which was great with really helpful reception staff. Nice bar area with great food and drinks and a good quality breakfast. Bedroom was very comfortable clean and quiet! Would stay again!!,4,2019,06,19
248,10 of 10 score for hotel in Dublin,"Stayed one night prior at Hilton and after staying two different, 2-night stays at Camden Court, this is my new go-to place for lodging in Dublin.  Service is impeccable, all the staff with whom I interacted were friendly, smiling and accommodating.  The restaurant I only visited for the breakfast buffet, which was standard Irish fare but again, staff was attentive and pleasant.  The bar/cafe area was perhaps my favorite, however, with a fine selection of drafts and a decent menu of tasty vittles (the vegetable soup was the best I had in Ireland).  The wide-open, well-lit and comfortable lounge area made it all the more welcoming.  The fitness / leisure facility was also quite good, with a nicely-equipped gym and sizable locker room/shower area, as well as a hot tub, eucalyptus steam, dry sauna and large heated pool.  Rooms were clean, quiet and roomy - with windows that actually open for fresh air (a rarity in hotels today).  Location is ideal for getting pretty much anywhere in Dublin too.  Overall, I give Camden Court a perfect 10 of 10 score, will def stay here on future visits.  Well done! ",5,2019,06,18
248,Great Location,Stayed for a short break.  The friendly staff and great location for restaurants & pubs make this an ideal hotel for central Dublin. The 757 bus from Dublin Airport terminates across the road from the hotel which is very handy.,5,2019,06,18
248,Wonderful experience,"From the time we arrived in the Hotel on Tuesday morning 11th June we were treated royally!!  We were a wedding party and the Hotel upgraded the Bride and Groom to a beautiful suite for no extra cost for the whole three days!  Nothing was any trouble to the staff at reception and the Hotel and their staff helped to add to a wonderful and most enjoyable wedding experience.  We couldn'f fault them in any way.  Would recommend this Hotel to anyone.  The rooms were lovely, food good, service excellent, staff delightful.  Would stay there again anytime!",5,2019,06,18
248,Excellent hotel,"Stayed in this hotel recently and I could not fault it. Nice clean rooms, comfortable beds, lovely restaurant, tastefully decorated lobby with big comfy sofas. The front desk staff were friendly and helpful, as where the bar staff when we had lunch in the bar not long after arrival. As for the location, there are lots of bars and places to eat nearby, with the iveagh gardens a stone's throw away, and st.stephens green and grafton street just a short walk away. ",5,2019,06,17
248,No air conditioning and rude,"The check in desk was rude upon arrival and demanding. They were not accommodating. There is NO air conditioning. They are not close to the city center.  Decor is out of date and old. Rooms are very tiny. 
",1,2019,06,17
248,Location and Service are great,"I've stayed in the Camden Court in January, May and June of this year so far on business trips ranging from one night to 4 nights. The staff are very pleasant to deal with from those at reception, to the bar to the breakfast. 

The hotel rooms are okay too, probably in need of an upgrade at this stage but I cannot complain too much, they have everything needed and are clean and you can't beat the hotel for location when working close by in Stephens Green",4,2019,06,17
248,Great Birthday Stay!,"Brilliant stay at the Camden Court Hotel - we arrived early and didn't think we would be able to check in but Owen on the front desk said our room would be ready in 5 minutes. When we got to the room there was a beautiful hand written birthday card and box of chocolates waiting for me - which was so lovely and thoughtful! We then went down to the pool area which was so nice and relaxing, after we ordered room service which was very quick arriving. We had an amazing stay - the hotel is very well located, food was great, staff were so nice and welcoming, big thanks to Owen on the front desk for everything! Highly recommend the Camden Court Hotel! ",5,2019,06,17
248,Good location ,"A good location on the south Dublin City.clean modern rooms,food wasn’t great got the sandwiches which weren’t good and breakfast that morning wasn’t great cold beans and rashers were worse than a deli.but overall good hotel but we got poor meals",3,2019,06,16
248,Best customer service I ever experienced ,"I was stuck in Dublin without a hotel reservation due to a fake accommodation listing on another website. Apparently I arrived on one of Dublin’s busiest weekends and most of Dublin was booked out.

Steve and Owen at the front desk heard about my troubles and went to the effort of ringing their contacts at over 10 hotels to find me a last minute cancellation.

Amazing over and above customer service, unbelievable when they were full themselves and could’ve easily just said sorry we were full. But they did not stop until they found something for me. 

I am in customer service industry myself and to see that level of dedication is very rare and inspirational.

I cannot thank them enough. Awesome. Highly recommended.",5,2019,06,14
248,Amazing ,"Myself and my sister stayed here last night for the Elton John concert. Hope is really central. Staff are excellent and extremely helpful. All I can say about the hotel was WOW. The reception area was stunning and extremely well laid out. 
The twin room we had booked was lovely and extremely comfortable. Good tea and coffee. Also a coffee machine like a dolce gusto/tassimo. 
The shower was powerful and the perfect temperature. There was a bath and the toiletries were Orla Kiely. 
We had a great night sleep in very cosy & comfortable beds. The room was quite and a perfect temperature. 
Highly recommend this hotel and will definitely be going there again. ",5,2019,06,13
248,Excellent,"A very nice hotel, conveniently located with friendly staff, good rooms (spacious, well-appointed, good wi-fi) and an excellent breakfast.  It's not cheap, but I would recommend this to anyone visiting Dublin.  ",5,2019,06,13
248,Great stay,"Staff helpful, nice breakfast, comfortable bed, clean room .Location easy to get to, bar staff not friendly so We left the bar went to pub next store this had great stay I would go back to Camden court hotel",4,2019,06,11
248,Great room,Had a really nice stay here in June the reception staff were very friendly and helpful. We stayed in a family room it was very spacious and really nice had everything we needed plus a massive tv to keep the kids busy.,5,2019,06,11
248,Avoid this hotel.,"Good location in Portobello area but hotel is dated and needs refurbishing.  No sheets on our beds.  No temperature controls in room.  Only way to cool is to open window, leading to street noise.  It's on a busy street, near bars and restaurants.  For this room rate ( about 190 Euros per night) you can and should do better.",3,2019,06,09
248,Very comfortable hotel with great fitness club and cafe in the foyer,This hotel was a little out of the centre of town but it suited us on this occasion.  It is on a busy main road but there is a very convenient rear entrance for taxis etc to pull in.  The room was generous & very comfortable.,5,2019,06,08
248,Stayed with a large group,"This hotel is beautiful.  There are rooms for conferences and meetings, as well as a delicious restaurant attached for breakfast in the morning.  The staff was very helpful and our check in and check out was seamless.  The rooms are adequate and the bathrooms are luxurious.  I had a great stay.",5,2019,06,05
248,Good location,"We stayed here 2 nights with our bus tour, was handy to walk to all the attractions nearby. Took the airport bus to hotel...it stopped right across the street!
Clean and comfy rooms, and room staff were friendly and efficient.
Enjoyed the pool and hot tub. We ate dinner downstairs first nite.,very good salmon,
Service was excellent.breakfast was included.",5,2019,06,05
248,A short visit in Dublin,"A very good overall experience! The lobby area is enormous, with many sitting groups, and food and drink service at call. Nice bar area. The room was fine, bathroom in good order. Breakfast included was very satisfactory. The in-house restaurant had a limited menu, but satisfactory and big portions. Some good restaurants nearby, but not as comprehensive and good as expected from ads.
On the minus side: Busloads of tourists will fill the lobby area at times, converting it to a mixture of high street noises and kindergarten.",4,2019,06,05
248,Not worth the price,"Seems luxurious but is quite average. Bed was not comfortable, room had no temperature control and the window did not even open. It made for an unpleasant night’s sleep. The pool is also not the luxurious experience I expected. ",2,2019,06,04
248,Public spaces nice but beds were not,"Beds were uncomfortable. Pool and service were quite nice. Checkin and out were simple. Bit of confusing system for getting taxis. However, lack of sleep is hard to replace. Hard beds, hard pillows. We were looking for a 4 star experience and this didn’t end up where we had planned. Not horrible. Just not great. ",3,2019,06,02
248,Good Location,We stayed here the night we arrived in Dublin and then again a week later. The hotel is central and we found it simple to get around from this point to many of the things we wanted to do. The first night I had issues sleeping because the room was right on a Main Street. The beds were comfortable but the pillow the second night were terrible. I ended up using a folded towel so not a great sleep. The breakfast was very good and we found the staff very accommodating,4,2019,05,31
248,Great experience,"great location, quality hotel.  The rooms are good size, quality beds and bedding, nice furnishings and toiletries. Climate controlled and quiet rooms.  Excellent amenities including pool.  The bonus is underground parking!",4,2019,05,30
248,Vacation Site seeing,"Wonderful time. We were in the downtown area. Next to Trinity College.  Could not have asked for any better position for the time we were there. Two nights to get to know the city. I enjoyed the location because the pubs, restaurants were all there so I could enjoy the rugby games during my visit. I did not have to look for anything in my rooms. The staff were helpful towards any inquiries we needed.",4,2019,05,28
248,A Hotel which can offer our needs,"Stayed for 2days, not the top end hotel but has all the facilities, pool sauna gym etc. GOOD restaurants offer tasty food, breakfast was good. Services too good. Close proximity to Tram car and bus. Walking distance to many restaurants",4,2019,05,27
248,Short stay,Hotel is excellent. Very easy to get into city centre from here. Rooms are very comfortable. Food is excellent and staff are brilliant. Hotel is very clean. Did not use the leisure facilities so i cannot comment on them.,5,2019,05,27
248,Disappointed! Poor customer service,"The staff at the desk was constantly arguing with me. Very sad! Even after I brought this to their attention on how poor the service was and how bad it could affect their reputation, the manager gave a cheeky smile like he didn't care or it's not his business. So sad! He actually said I am just one customer. Welle you have just lost one customer and good luck to the rest.",1,2019,05,26
248,Very nice hotel,It was a nice hotel to stay in. 20 minutes walk from the center. There were many restaurants in the area to eat. The area in itself was safe and busy on weekends. The hotel was also a place for socialising. The gym was also well stocked. ,4,2019,05,23
248,Great hotel centrally located ,Stayed in the Camden court hotel for 2 nights. Found the room to be comfortable and clean. The room was aired and bed dressed on the second day. It is beside the Harcourt luas stop which is only one stop from St. Stephen's green. The receptionists were curtious and gave us every assistance. ,5,2019,05,22
248,Two nights in Dublin,The check-in was a breeze. They do charge for parking but there was plenty of spaces.The room was comfortable and clean. The shower only has a half glass so it’s easy to wet the countertop as my husband did (all over my toiletry bag). Breakfast buffet had plenty of food options. The hotel is walkable to the major sites. ,5,2019,05,20
248,Good and comfortable stay,A good stay at Camden court. Bed could be a bit softer. Excellent breakfast good location and very nice pool and recreation area. Staff generally friendly and helpful. Very clean. My room was quiet but I heard that others were noisier. ,4,2019,05,18
248,Nice Hotel.  ,"The hotel is nice, rooms were comfortable, breakfast was great, not nuts about dinner, but I was a bit jet lagged so- no harm, no foul for the hotel. Nice central location, great pub next door, prices were reasonable, and staff of hotel were good. On a tour so check ins and outs were a breeze. Hotel bar and lobby was also nice. Dublin is a great city. History and culture galore and great people who just wanted us to have fun and enjoy their city...and we certainly did. ",4,2019,05,13
248,Fantastic,"Just simply fantastic, beautiful decor, fresh breakfast , cleanliness of a high standard, location was on point, short walf to dublins buzzing nightlife. Five star! We would definately stay here again.",5,2019,05,11
248,Good hotel for this part of Dublin,"Good hotel if your travels bring you to this part of Dublin. Convenient to food, shopping, tourist sites, public transportation. Hotel restaurant and bar have good selections (pizza is great), beds are so comfortable you won't want to get up, and even basic rooms are spacious. ",4,2019,05,10
248,Amazing Hospitality,Just wanted to say a special thank you to Nicole Hill for taking care of all of my team of TheaPamex the morning Friday 3rd of May. Her bright smile and service made our stay very special. I look forward to returning to Camden Court again soon. All the staff are so professional and helpful.,5,2019,05,10
248,Excellent staff,Staff was super-helpful. Location is perfect. We’d definitely book here again. Great pubs and restaurants within walking distance and very convenient to Airlink. The staff went above and beyond for us and we appreciated it. ,5,2019,05,09
248,Brilliant stay.,"Am back from a short stay at this fantastic hotel. Everything about this hotel was perfect for me personally. Staff were wonderful, food was very tasty and my room was very comfortable too. The bed was so comfortable I could have spent the whole day in it. Made use of the tea and coffee making facilities too. Would tell everyone to stay here, you will not be disappointed.",5,2019,05,06
248,Poor breakfast... ,"Me & my friends (four of us) decided to stay at Camden Court Hotel while we were visiting Dublin. Hotel’s location is great, close to centre and surrounded so many nice cafes, restaurants and bars. Staff is very friendly and helpful, rooms are clean and big. We loved the hotels. But the breakfast was very poor. We added breakfast to our booking. 4 of us we paid nearly €50 extra for breakfast. Don’t chose breakfast option because there are so many nice restaurants and cafes around, and you can get decent and good quality food and cheaper. The sausage and bacon they use for the breakfast were awful. I'm not exaggerating. I wouldn’t give it to my pet. Eggs are also over cooked and stayed there for ages. For that money we paid we were expecting good quality good. Their breakfast is based on bread, croissants, cereal and some fruits that’s all. ",3,2019,05,05
248,Highly reccomended.,"Beautiful hotel, great location, first class service in all departments. wonderful choice at breakfast.
We will be back.  We had lovely meals at 2 restaurants just across the street, Damascus Gate  and The Monto Restaurant/Steakhouse.",5,2019,05,05
248,The wonderful Camden Court,Lovely hotel with wonderful staff ... ace location ... ideally situated for centre of Dublin and the national concert hall ... Stephens green ... Luas (their trams) ... leason lane ... hatch street ... park place ,5,2019,05,04
248,Very good hotel in the center of Dublin,"Great location in walking distance to Stephen's Green and Grafton Street. Airport bus stops right across the street. The rooms are spacious with very comfortable beds, great breakfast buffet, staff is very friendly and supportive ",4,2019,05,03
248,Really good hotel,"My wife and I stayed B and B 3 nights in April.  We enjoyed our stay here very much.  Lovely clean room with large bed with all facilities in good order.  Great breakfast and bar.  Also used leisure centre on bottom floor, very impressed.  Staff on reception and leisure centre were very friendly and helpful. Would definitely recommend this hotel and will come back again.",5,2019,05,03
248,First visit to Dublin,Stayed at the Camden Court Hotel for three nights very impressed with the hotel the staff were very good in all areas visited the restaurant and bar areas had very good food and drinks respectivelyand professionally served in both departments  Bedroom well fitted out and very clean overall a very nice hotel to stay at for all age groups,4,2019,04,27
248,Great stay,"great hotel very good location, very relaxing very comfortable seating in the lobby, room was comfortable with water supplied, tea and coffee also in the room ,over all we really enjoyed our stay and would like to stay again bringing the family with us Thank you Camden Court ",5,2019,04,26
248,"Excellent hotel, central location","This is a first rate hotel, with comfortable rooms, good breakfast and helpful staff. Great location, near all you could want.Very busy with international groups. Hotel is very clean and attractive. Would stay again.",4,2019,04,26
248,Good and bad points,"The good: decor in foyer is lovely and modern, staff polite and attentive, location is great about 8 mins walk from Grafton St, small amount of hotel parking, rooms are  very clean and there is a swimming pool for guest use.

The bad: Rooms are small but I guess it is Dunlin. Our room had 2 single beds pushed together to make a bigger bed but the duvet provided barely reached the edges of the bed so we were constantly fighting for the duvet. Noise from other guests banging their doors is annoying, practically shakes the room when they bang closed. You can hear every noise from guests in the hallway which is annoying when people insist on having a full conversation outside your door. Housekeeping were hoovering from 9am which is annoying when you have been out late to be woken so early with that. 

Overall this hotel does what it needs to, wouldn't say it's the best 4 star I've ever stayed in but it does the job.",3,2019,04,26
248,Very good hotel on a perfect location,We booked the hotel for a weekend trip to Dublin. We had a warm welcome and the room was clean. Also the location is perfect. Close to the Centre but far enough away from the busy centre (tempel bar). We had a perfect time at the Camden court hotel,4,2019,04,24
248,Great stay,"We had a fantastic stay at Camden Court Hotel and would definitely return on our next visit to Dublin. The room was spacious and clean, with a huge, comfy bed. 

We also took advantage of the leisure facilities, the pool area and gym were much better than in any other hotel I’ve been to in a city.

Location was perfect, lots of bar and restaurants surrounding area and a nice walk to the main stretch. 

Definitely recommend.",5,2019,04,24
248,Fantastic hotel,Second visit and this hotel is fantastic.  Room and staff are perfect and the location is second to none. Special mention for the lady serving the cooked breakfast... a real character who had us laughing both days she is a credit to the hotel. Thank you.,5,2019,04,24
248,Great hotel in very good location,"Stay here every year at Easter now. Leave the car in their underground car park and can enjoy the city on foot. Great leisure facilities, friendly staff and good food. Bedrooms very comfortable with everything you need.",4,2019,04,24
248,Excellent 💯,"We loved our stay! Service and cleanliness was excellent ! Def coming back to stay here. Close to all amenities, tourist locations.  We will be booking here again. Definitely. 
All Staff very accommodating very quick to provide what we needed, very friendly and helpful. 
",5,2019,04,23
248,comic on reception,"This is a good hotel in central location 2 minutes from Harcourt luas stop.Bedrooms small but functional and comfortable.Their website is a little misleading in that it offers complimentary breakfast if you book direct but does not seem to b available all the time when you try to book it.We were on a two night stay and decided to extend by one night and when i queried the complimentary breakfast the male receptionist said "" you should read the terms and conditions"".I have to say I did not find his response nearly as hilarious as his colleagues on reception seemed to ..Thankfully there were other hotels glad of our business for the extra night.",4,2019,04,23
248,Disappointing mid-week break,"We stayed in the Camden Court Hotel for a 1-night mid-week break.

The hotel is in a great location within 10-15 mins walking distance of the city centre and were offering a great deal on the double room with breakfast included which is unusual for Dublin City Centre hotels and real value for money.

The double room was spacious and comfortable with a well-sized bathroom. The room itself was spotlessly clean but overall it seemed very faded and tired, a fresh coat of paint would have gone a long way to address this impression. No artwork on the walls, no hotel information in the room, small touches which seemed odd and added to the general tired impression. Though the coffee machine is a nice touch if you're into your coffee which I am.

We ate out that night in a nearby pub restaurant, another great plus for the hotel as there's any amount of bars/restaurants in and around the Camden Street area, and came back to the hotel for a nightcap. The lobby and bar were busy with a mixture of business travellers and tourists which gave it a nice atmosphere. We sat out in the lobby, and I ordered a pint of Carlsberg (probably not the best Lager in the world!) from the bar and it was completely gone off, a rank taste and worse smell. We were so tired at that stage we just called it a night, and I didn't bother returning the pint to the bar.

Breakfast the next morning was buffet style served by the hotel chefs. We both opted for the cooked breakfast but the portions offered by the serving chef were miserly in the extreme, one bacon, one egg, one of everything essentially. Oliver Twist sprang to mind, please Sir can I have some more! It also struck me the cooked meats were nothing to write home about for a 4-star hotel and I wonder is this how they are able to offer an inclusive breakfast? 

Particularly struck me as I often have occasion to be in the area on business and have often ate lunch in the Camden Court and their lunchtime dinners are really excellent, generous portions (in contrast to the breakfast!!), and represent some of the best value in the Camden Street area in my opinion, given all the area's much vaunted but generally over-priced and over-rated foodie reputation.

So overall a disappointing stay and as per usual not for one particular reason but for a mixture of things. Certainly the Camden Court didn't put it's best foot forward on this occasion, but equally I'd be reluctant not to recommend given it's location, my previous experience of it with the generally good service and friendliness of staff I've encountered. But I'd have to say based on this single experience I wouldn't be rushing back.",3,2019,04,21
248,Great staff in good location,"The hotel is located next to the hot spot areas of Dublin. The public transportation system connects it well to all the beautiful places. The staff is very polite and helpful. The rooms are clean, but should become renovated in the near future.",4,2019,04,21
248,Fab Hotel,"Great value for money.
Had triple room, room was very spacious
Hotel was very nice, clean & tidy 
Pool area was an added bonus complementary towels also given
The hotel was a 15 min walk into main town, not great when raining & cold!
On the whole would recommend this hotel

",5,2019,04,19
248,Great location to explore Dublin on foot.,"Great hotel, comfy family room, great breakfast and lovely swimming pool. Payable car parking on site is a bonus in the city. Walking distance to temple bar and all the sites. There’s a restaurant in the hotel but also lots of others nearby. Would book again.",5,2019,04,18
248,Good location for exploring,"Good location. Breakfast good. Staff pleasant enough but overall the hotel and staff a bit sterile and impersonal. Not much character, could be in a hotel anywhere. 
Clean and everything you needed in the room. Not sure about the iron being attached to the board, made it difficult to use, hardly think anyone would walk out with an iron! ",4,2019,04,16
248,Excellent hotel,"Stayed for 2 nights with a group of friends, everything from check in to check out suberb. Staff friendly and helpful, hotel bar prices reasonable for a city centre hotel, didn't use the restaurant, excellent facilities rooms spacious warm and clean. Can't understand the negative reviews nothing but a positive experience for all our friends who stayed over the weekend. Would definitely recommend and return to the Camden Court Hotel.",5,2019,04,15
248,Birthday night away,"A night away with husband and grown up daughters. 
This hotel was excellent and I was very impressed with the professionalism and courtesy of the staff. Friendly and helpful without being over the top.
Room spacious and bed so comfy.
Swimming pool a bonus.
Breakfast extensive and served in airy spacious dining room.
Lots of lively bars and restaurants in immediate vicinity.
Everything excellent but staff are the real winners here. This hotel is lucky to have found them in this era of staff shortages.
Will definitely return.",5,2019,04,14
248,Very good hotel,"Excellent hotel most of reception staff very good but by good they have some surly staff there, hotel is in a convenient location and rooms very nice but make sure you get a room at the back as ones facing onto the street are very noisy until late",4,2019,04,13
248,Fantastic ,"Myself and 3 friends stayed at The Caden Court this week. We were greeted by friendly staff, nothing was too much trouble. The spa and pool were fabulous,  which we made good use of. The rooms were clean and spacious and extremely comfortable. The breakfasts were fit for a king and set us up for the day ahead.  We have all said that we will definitely go back as a group and also bring our families with us. They should be very proud of the service and welcome that they provide. We'll done.",5,2019,04,12
248,"Nice rooms, great bar, good location","This was the second time we stayed at the Camden Court in as many years. Tram station is less than a minute away and all the attractions in the city are well within walking distance.
Rooms are spacious and clean. Staff was courteous and the bar is well stocked with a nice sitting area.
The only thing that bothered us was a ruckus in the middle of the night, apparently from across the street. Made it hard for our daughter in her own room to be well rested in the morning. Since the hotel was fully booked there was no chance for another room. Second night was much better. When you book a room try and get one above the second floor and to the back of the property to avoid this.",4,2019,04,12
248,Fabulous City Break,"The hotel is absolutely stunning! A little haven within the core of the city, providing the opportunity to have some R&R and still be within walking distance of the main tourist attractions. The staff are attentive and always happy to help - we very much enjoyed our stay and will return. The pool, sauna and steam room was also a lovely touch. Fully recommend to anyone who wants a little luxury whilst staying within the city!",5,2019,04,11
248,Fantastic Hotel -Never disappoints !,"Fantastic hotel, in a great location and provides a first class service in all areas! All staff are dedicated to ensuring your stay is memorable and make you feel valued as a customer.
Brilliant facilities...gym, pool and car parking. The reception provide a warm welcome while the restaurants and bars serve quality food and drinks. The pizza is my favourite.
Rooms are warm, very comfortable and spotless. I even stayed in one of the suites and have used the hotel on numerous occasions!
Everything under one roof.",5,2019,04,11
248,STAY AWAY FROM THIS NIGHMARE OF A HOTEL,"one of the worst hotels i have ever had to stay in, never again. NEVER in my life have i been treated so so horribly as i was here, the manager Jacob is the rudest, most ignorant man i have ever come across in my life. He treated my sister and I in a dispicable manner. (He actually told us to complain and that he didnt care cause he was manager). On top of this nightmare of a human (jacob) we also found dirty socks and underwear under the bed so it must not have been thoroughly cleaned and the hotel did not seem to care. Breakfast was €17pp for the most average food i have ever tasted -couldve made nicer myself. Overall absolutely awful experience here. Would not recommend to my worst enemy!!",1,2019,04,08
248,Great hotel,Super staff and hotel. Excellent facilities for the price. Definitely book again. Super gym and spa. Located close to airport bus and great pubs and restaurants . Excellent location. Really good centre for your hols,5,2019,04,07
248,Not a high class hotel,"I have been staying at the Camden Court now and then for the last eleven years. It has not improved during that time. Some staff members are kind and helpful, others feel like if you are bothering them. It is a big and not very personal hotel. The breakfast is ordinary and not worth €17. There is apparently no choice of different teas (just ""tea"") and the juices do not have a significant amount of fruit in them. For breakfast, try Sophie's some hundred metres away. Better, nicer. And cheaper.",3,2019,04,07
248,"Nice hotel, but rude personnel","Stayed for 2 nights, the 29th and 30th of March. The hotel was nice, it had a safe feel for 2 women traveling in Dublin. The lobby was nice with a nice coffee bar. The room was clean and beds comfortable. It always felt hot in the room, so had to keep the window open for air, and it was noisy. The reason for the poor review was the woman that checked us into the hotel on Friday evening. She was extremely rude. I’m a travel agent, and have escorted groups all over the world. I have never been treated like that in my life. It was shocking. She did not know I was a travel agent, as I was checking in with my adult daughter on a personal trip. I asked if she would like my pre-paid voucher. She rudely said no. She then shoved a paper at us to fill out. She never talked directly to me, only to my daughter. As I was filling out her paper, she ignored me and started rapidly giving my daughter information about the hotel instead of me. I stopped filling out the paper so I could hear the information. She still completely ignored me, and only talked directly to my daughter. This happened twice. I finally signed the paper and pushed it back at her in disbelief. She then gave the key to my daughter, still ignoring me. It was so rude and so disrespectful, I was speechless. I book Ireland a lot, and have for 30 years, but I will never book this hotel for my clients, because of the way this woman acted.",2,2019,04,01
248,Repeat Visit,"Great place to stay in Dublin.  Handy from airport 757 bus, last stop and cross street to Camden Court.  Everything you need within walking distance.  Pub on site, adjoining Bleeding horse pub, great food and drink up and down street.  Wonderful staff and rooms.  Pool a sauna.",5,2019,03,27
248,Lovely hotel in a great location,"I stayed here for 3 nights on business.  The rooms were excellent, with a big, comfortable bed and a good size en suite bath.  This hotel is close to a lot of shopping and restaurants, there are loads of things to do in the neighborhood.  The breakfast bar is really good and the staff are very kind, professional.
I would definitely stay here again.",5,2019,03,27
248,Weekend Break,"We stayed at the Camden for a 2 nght weekend break. I booked and accessible room as I am a permanent wheelchair user, the bathroom within the room was totally unaceptable for wheelchair users. The toilet was of a standard height with one very wobbley bar to one side of the toilet, the other bar was too far away to reach from the toilet. The tiny vanity sink within the bathroom was impractical for washing and the size of a hand wash sink that would normally be within a small vanity room, in my opinion this was added to attempt to give more floor space. The door to the room was of normal width and hard to get into the room as was the bathroom door.
We decided to have a meal in the bar and ordered our food, my daughter changed her mind within 2 minutes of ordering the food and we asked the waiter if the order could be changed, we were told this could not be done as it had been ordered on the system ? odd considering it was only 2 minutes.",1,2019,03,27
248,Great place to stay,We really enjoyed our stay here. The rooms were spotlessly clean and comfortable. The swimming pool was a decent size with a safe pool for littlies and a jacuzzi. The staff were helpful and friendly and extremely kind to our family group. We had a perfectly acceptable supper and the staff were chaming and tolerant to the three young ones in our party. Breakfast was fine; there was a good variety of food including  fresh fruit salad. The eggs were poached to perfection.,4,2019,03,26
248,Well situated hotel that handled our group perfectly!,"Stayed at Camden Court for St. Patrick's Weekend - 3 days.  We were a group of 31 that stayed in 15 rooms, and check in was a breeze.  This hotel is located within walking distance to most sights with a great pub next door (The Bleeding Horse), and an excellent Kebab place across the street, which we used for late night snacks 2 out of 3 three nights.  The Breakfast Buffet was ample with the same offerings each day, plentiful and a good start to our day.  The rooms and beds were comfortable, the only downside was our window didn't open too far because there was a flower basket right outside that prevented the window from opening, and it got quite stuffy in the room.  The family rooms are the same size as the standard rooms so the double and twin bed were a little tight, but we made out just fine.  Definitely would stay here again - and thank you to the front desk for accomodating our group so efficiently!!",4,2019,03,26
248,Cannot fault,This was my 3rd stay here with my daughter. ..she books it as a Christmas present for me. .and I have to say it's one of the best that Dublin has to offer. .great location.

248,"Lovely hotel, very good location","Would highly recommend the Camden court hotel if you are looking for somewhere to stay in central Dublin.

Very friendly staff, room was good size and lovely and clean.

In walkiny distance to St.Stephens Green and lots of nice pubs and places to eat close by.",5,2019,03,23
248,Perfect location,Great place to visit Dublin. The rooms are big enough and the beds quite comfortable. The staff (restaurant & reception) was very nice and attentive. 5 stars for them! The only downside was the breakfast which was not bad but I believe that can be improved Overall is a perfect place to explore Dublin.,4,2019,03,21
248,Restaurant Service,"While the food quality here is good, the service is appalling the staff are always too eager to take your plate and tray off you. One of the days I was eating i left my tray under my plate and a staff member asked to take it even though i was in the middle of my meal. Also the second you drop your fork expect one to come over to take your plate. While these are small complaints ive eaten here a few times and it feels uninviting and like your being watched or pestered by staff to take your plate or tray and its quite a rubbish experience due to this.",2,2019,03,20
248,Centrally located,"Nice  hotel with friendly, helpful staff. The hotel is located about 17-20 minutes walking distance from Temple Bar area and 15 minutes walking from St. Patrick's Cathedral and St. Stephen's Green. 
We also were able to walk to Jameson and Guinness without any problems.",4,2019,03,20
248,Dublin City break @ Camden court,"Great hotel, lovely spa facilities, excellent food and reasonably priced drinks.  Approximately 15 minute walk into Dublin City, through a nice safe area. Nice orla Kelly products in hotel room. Staff very friendly and helpful",4,2019,03,19
248,Good base to explore Dublin,"We went for St Patrick's weekend and our wedding anniversary.  The hotel is comfortable and convenient for exploring the city sights.  It's about 20 min walk to Graffton St. and a pleasant walk through St Stephens Green. The restaurant is good, the only negative is when we had a Sunday evening meal there were no vegetables on the menu!",4,2019,03,19
248,Great Hotel - would stay again!,"We stayed for St Patricks weekend! Lovely hotel, great location.. Walking distance to Temple bar, but also lots of bars and restaurants nearby!

248,Best beds I've slept in a hotel for a long time,"The Camden Court Hotel is a nice hotel, a little bit outdated, but good overall. The big surprise was the bed, one of the best I've slept in a very long time. Usually I find beds in hotels too soft, and this was just perfect, firm but very comfortable. Totally recommended!",4,2019,03,17
248,Fabulous Dublin Location ,"Very good deals for this ideally located hotel. Surrounded by great bars and restaurants and easy walking to all Dublin’s famous landmarks it’s ideal for both tourists or like ourselves, out of towners who fancied a night out in Dublin. While rooms are average and breakfast was just ok, the friendly and helpful staff raise the star rating. A big advantage is the onsite car park and leisure centre. A real gem for a city centre hotel. ",4,2019,03,15
248,Quiet end of town,"Fantastic location opp a bus stop which is a direct link to the airport. We bought a 3 day travel card which covered not only the transfers but also hop on hop off. Hotel next door to bleeding horse pub, near a small tesco local and short walk from nightclubs too. Rooms were immaculate and hotel staff couldn't do enough to make sure our stay was perfect. Good bar/foyer area to relax. Buffet breakfast was great value and offered a good selection of hot and cold. They keep quiet about the omlettes...fresh to order. A short walk to St Stephens park and the hop on hop off bus stop. Brisk 15 min walk to temple bar area. We even walked back from the 3arena on sat night, although i was glad i had flat shoes and i wouldn't recommend unless you really need to hit your 10,000 steps",5,2019,03,12
248,Disappointed,"Business overnight so only in hotel for 8 hours - 11pm to 7am. No hot water for bath/shower in morning and breakfast only available from 7am.

Didn't stay in hotel long enough to draft or write 200 words!",2,2019,03,10
248,Not good enough,"Hotel is well located, clean and easy to get around, staff friendly. Unfortunately the hotel is dated, TV remote in room was intermittent, and there was no hot water so freezing cold shower was not the start to the day I wanted. Clearly this was not an issue just for the room I was in as upon check out other guests were complaining - the receptionists response ‘a cold shower is good for you’...which felt flat on the guests.",2,2019,03,08
248,Perfect stay,Great stay from start to finish the staff were friendly and upbeat checking us in early and with a smile. The hotel room was very modern with all amenities you could need th3 bath is a little on the shallow side but a great shower and everything was very clean. Bed was very comfortable. The pool was lovely towels provided and we had a deep tissue massage this was fabulous. The hotel is a short walk from all tourist attractions and lots of transport links with the airport bus right outside. Breakfast was incredible great choice and all fresh. Dinner was lovely we had the fish and chips all very fresh. Could add more items to menu. 5star hotel in my opinion.,5,2019,03,07
248,Great lunch,"It is lovely to be able to take 30 minutes out of the working day and enjoy a lovely lunch here. The food is lovely, staff are very friendly and I will be back soon. It is nice to come here with friends and I often come on a Saturday afternoon for lunch and it is great being able to wast have the world go by in those great window seats. ",4,2019,03,06
248,Charming Hotel,This is a very charming hotel where the room was a little small but clean and nice. It's in a nice location close to many restaurants and pubs. There is a very nice pool on the lower level. The breakfast buffet is decent.,4,2019,03,04
248,Lovely hotel in Dublin,"I felt immediately welcome at the hotel, especially having been delayed by four hours and arriving much later than planned. The staff was helpful, the room had everything I needed and the breakfast was excellent.",4,2019,03,04
248,"Nice rooms and great location, food is expensive ","Nice rooms and great location, food is expensive but luckily enough there are great bars and restaurants nearby. The pickle Indian restaurant in particular is excellent.

Car park is tight so be careful with larger cars 

Watch out for deals online ",3,2019,03,04
248,Charming Hotel,"This is a beautifully charming hotel close to Dublin city centre,to bus stop and the Luas. The room was nice, super clean . The staff in reception were very nice and friendly . I had dinner in their lovely restaurant and have to commend the lovely waitress Isabel, friendly , charming and extremely helpful. Food was really great too. The leisure centre was fantastic , swimming pool area and lockers super clean and tidy. Really enjoyed the stay and will come again .",5,2019,03,03
248,Great place to stay,Great hotel central to restaurants and Temple Bar District just a short walk away for entertainment. Great breakfast and descent restaurant. Parking on site is handy and easy to use. Great pool and gym.,5,2019,03,02
248,"Lovely hotel, good food, great staff and wonderful location","A lovely hotel in the more interesting part of Dublin,  Lots of restaurants etc very close by as well as walking access to the heart of Dublin (was 10-15 mins to O'Connell bridge

The rooms were spacious, the staff professional and friendly. Breakfast had a good choice and had dinner there a couple of times and was lovely.

All in all a nice hotel and would stay here again whenever am next in Dublin",5,2019,02,26
248,Perfect hotel to stay centrally in Dublin,"We visited Dublin over New Years with a group of friends, 10 of us, and needed a hotel that was within walking distance to everything as we didn't want to rely on cabs or the Luas, his hotel is perfect in that respect. It's situated just a few minutes walk from St Stephens Green and Grafton Street, about 15 minutes walk to Temple Bar but the best part is its far enough away from those areas that it's quiet at night. The hotel was spotlessly clean, the beds were very comfortable and the service received from the hotel staff was fantastic including the room service. It was out first time staying here (and we visit Dublin two to three times per year) and we will most definitely stay here again. It was very hard to find any negatives.",5,2019,02,19
248,Trad Fest,The Camden Court was our hotel for the Trad Frst music festival in Dublin. This is a very nice hotel with comfortable rooms. The lobby area is great to visit in and have a cocktail. The breakfast was included . What a breakfast 🤗 You didn’t go away hungry and you were in a comfortable setting. The wait staff was always friendly. The entire property was clean and professionally staffed. The bus route is right outside and takes you to the city center quickly. I would definitely stay here again.,5,2019,02,13
248,Loved it,"Great spot, lovely room. All you can drink coffee, water and fresh orange at reception.  Friendly helpful staff and attched to a great wee club. Had so much fun, would definitely go back there next time I go to Dublin. Bus to O Connell Street right outside for tourist stuff, but this is a fab area for going out. Wouldn't recommend it for families though. ",5,2019,02,12
248,Good hotel,"Stayed here as part of a rugby weekend. Really nice place, well appointed with everything you need and expect from a 4 star premises.

Our room was large, clean and comfortable.  The bed was huge and made up with good linen. Lovely, smart  bathroom. 

Breakfast was excellent with a wide choice of food. Nice bar area and a good vibe, probably helped by the rugby clientele. Staff were friendly and efficient. 

The hotel is situated around 20mins walk south of the famous Temple Bar area but is well served locally for bars and restaurants. Public transport including the tram is nearby. All other Dublin must do's are within 20 - 30 mins walking distance. Landsdowne Road us also walkable in around 30 mins.

Would stay here again.",5,2019,02,12
248,Great place in the heart of Dublin shopping. Just not really “user” friendly.,"While the rooms were nice and the location was awesome, the staff was just kind of there. I don’t know if this is typical for Ireland, but they definitely didn’t go out of their way for us. Please remember that “I don’t think so” or “I don’t know” isn’t an acceptable answer while working in any public service capacity,  unless it’s quickly followed by “I’ll look into that for you” as you pick up the phone. I asked about getting a fan for a room and got that answer. I asked about getting some sort of surge protector or at what store to find one and got the same answer. We were in a foreign country for the first time, and told them as much. After asking a few more questions and getting the same answer, I just gave up and bugged my travel agent in the States.",4,2019,02,12
248,Lovely Hotel,"Had a very comfortable nights stay in The Camden court Hotel. The room was very spacious and spotless. Good decor. Complimentary chocolates & greeting was much appreciated. 
The breakfast buffet had a very good selection and we enjoyed it very much. 
Looking forward to staying there again.",5,2019,02,12
248,Newly renovated reasonably priced hotel in central location ,"Stayed for a night for my partner's birthday in the Charlotte suite. I had a free night from hotels.com so decided to splash out and pay the extra to upgrade to a suite.

Gorgeous room with separate sitting area and the most comfortable bed! Slippers, robes and orla Kiely toiletries were a nice touch.

Mentioned the birthday ar check in - were given complimentary breakfast and they sent a lovely fruit plate and chocolates up to the room.

Breakfast great with the usual selection- lovely selection of breads and pastries.

There is a pool, gym sauna etc. We didn't use it but looks good. Staff were friendly.

Would recommend!",4,2019,02,10
248,Fantastic for a rugby game,"We have just returned from a great weekend in Dublin watching the Ireland v England game in the 6N rugby. 

We stayed at the Camden Court hotel as part of a package with Gullivers Travel. On arrival we were greeted with a warm welcome by the guy on reception, really personal, warm, friendly and funny - just what you'd expect from the Irish and really set the scene for a good weekend. 

The room was good, a bit of a business hotel look about it but everything worked and there was a proper coffee machine, which is lovely and knocks spots of the sachets of nescafe - thanks for that. Breakfast was good and they managed very well given the volume of people staying at the hotel. 

Location is perfect for a game at the Aviva and we walked both ways, we were also able to walk to St Stephens Green so easy access to the centre of the city if you want to do that. On the first night we had dinner around the corner at the Delahunt which was fantastic and a cocktail in the Sitting Room - all first class and faultless! 

Sadly we didn't find time to use the swimming pool, jacuzzi and sauna although it all looked very good, 

Wouldn't hesitate to stay again if we were visiting for the rugby,",4,2019,02,05
248,OK value for the money ,"Checking in and out is hazzle-free. Staff at the reception is friendly and efficient. Our rooms were a bit old-fashioned. Heating works well. 
Bar staff is friendly, too, but a bit slow and chaotic. 
For a short business trip the place is OK. Wouldn’t bring my family here, though. ",3,2019,02,04
248,Winning six nations visit ,"Stayed here Friday-Sunday for the Ireland England game, the hotel is well kept and the staff were helpful. Our bedroom was comfortable and clean and considering how busy the hotel was,it was very quiet around the hotel. The pool was a good size and the jacuzzi was very relaxing. The food in the hotel was good and catered for most tastes, although they could have done with a few more waiting staff on, for such a busy weekend. Having not been to Dublin before I was pleased to find out that the hotel is only a 15 min walk from Grafton street and a 20 minute walk to Aviva stadium. ",4,2019,02,03
248,"Excellent, central Dublin hotel","This hotel is in a great location in central Dublin, close to loads of bars and restaurants. The staff are friendly and efficient and big positives are the availability of an onsite car park, gym & pool. I would highly recommend to anyone staying in Dublin.",5,2019,02,03
248,Regular very happy customer,Stay here regularly whilst in Dublin with work. Great location. Comfortable clean rooms. Great breakfast. But the staff are the true stars. So friendly helpful and welcoming. Food in the bar is also good. Normal rooms lovely. Suites are really nice too if you want more space.,5,2019,02,03
248,Stayed here for 6 Nations,"Stayed here for three days really enjoyed the hotel.
The staff are very helpful and polite.
The room was very clean and house keeping very good as well.Breakfast good lots to choose from,would say would have liked the mushrooms cooked longer.
The rooms were warm.
Good location for visiting here,specially for tourists.Good walk into the city.",4,2019,02,03
248,Good location for tourists,"Good location for tourists, most things are within walking distance and it's an easy walk.  I asked for a family size room so that me and my adult son each had a decent size bed, the room is equivalent to an American room that is basic, which is large for Europe. The room was clean, but we had no control over the heating in the room at night and it was very warm.  The breakfast buffet has good options, but the staff is not friendly. The majority of my interactions with the staff were at breakfast and they could use a lesson on smiling and being friendly. I'd probably go back because it was a good deal for the room I just want interact with the staff unless necessary.",3,2019,02,02
248,Most Homely hotel in Dublin,"In my work role I end up staying in too many hotels but the Camden court is by far the most homely with extremely friendly and personable staff making mid week hotel stays for people like myself a lot easier .
The rooms are very cosy , there’s a very decent gym and pool so great for unwinding in the evening .
One of the better value hotels in an ideal location just out from the city centre but within easy walking distance and you can also explore nice parts of South Dublin ie Rathmines-Rathgar-Ranelagh in the opposite direction .",5,2019,01,30
248,Family stay ,"Beautiful redecorated hotels Ince our last visit.. Room was lovely and warm and comfy. Staff great, food great. Highly recommend... Convenient for Luas and shopping. If you can't get something at the buffet breakfast well... Your fussy.. It was beautiful. Definitely will be back. ",5,2019,01,29
248,Average hotel,The location is very good. Really central and near a nice green park. Bathroom is very nice and spacious. Bedroom is just ok. Breakfast is weak. A let down. Staff at breakfast wasn't nice either. Ok for 1 night business trip.,3,2019,01,27
248,Good place for a short stay,"The hotel is located in the heart of the city. The pool and the gym were great. Breakfast was amazing (was missing specials, e.g. omelettes to order, but outside of that- perfect!). Room was quite small, bed very comfortable. We got a room service trying to enter the room at 7am without even knocking, which was a bit upsetting. Also parking is not complimentary for guests, which is a bit disappointing. The room had a bath, but it was very shallow, so it was quite challenging to take a bath.",3,2019,01,26
248,Don’t stay on the 3rd floor,I recently stayed at the hotel for a couple of nights . The room i stayed in was opposite the ice machine . I cannot explain in words how incredibly loud this machine was . I strongly suggest the hotel looks to replace it or just turn it off . I recorded the sound and shared it with people I was visiting on business and they too were shocked that a hotel like this can think it is ok to rent out rooms knowing this noise is present,2,2019,01,25
248,"Great Place to Stay, Wish I Could have Stayed Longer","The Camden Court Hotel was where I stayed before going to Bundoran, and while I barely spent much time there, what I can say is that is it quite good. The rooms are fairly cozy, the bathrooms spacious and modern, and the beds, while a little small, are more than serviceable. The location is well-within several nightlife establishments, as well as not very far from some of Dublin's best sights. Before heading up to Bundoran, the hotel even served a fine breakfast. In short, I would recommend going here if you want to stay in Dublin for a little while.",4,2019,01,21
248,"Nice hotel, but get you food somewhere else","I went on a group trip with many colleagues from work. The lunshbuffe was simply ok, one had to ask the cook to put meat on the plate. Felt like I was at the food court in Ikea. Unfortunately the poultry was tasteless and a bit dry.

Later that evening the group had dinner. We all got an option between 3 starters, 3 main dish and 2 deserts. I startet with the smoked salmon. It was not a good choice. 
The salat under the way to smoked salmon was dry and lacked winegaer. Main course was pan fried chicken. And again the poultry was dry and tasteless. The chocolate cake for desert was fair. 

The hotel itself was very nice and the staff serviceminded. 
The room was very nice and the bed was soft. 
wifi in the room was awful. 

Overall a really nice hotel close to city center. 
I just will recommend people to eat elsewhere.",2,2019,01,20
248,Satisfactory,"Overall the hotel was neither bad or good. The room we had was large and nice, so we were happy with that. The pool area was also good.
The rest of the hotel was average. It felt very busy all the time and quite loud. The service was nonexistent. We tried to ask for sightseeing and restaurant recommendations and got nowhere. They did not even provide a map of the city.
The location to the main shopping part of the city was good. It was about a 10 minute walk.",3,2019,01,14
248,Beautiful hotel in Dublin,"We stayed here three nights during the new teet. The hotel is really well situated, only about 15 walk from the heart of the City. The local transportation (busses, trams) have their stops beide the Hotel. Also the airport busses stop there. Hotel is clean and the service well managed. We recommend!",5,2019,01,09
248,Great location,"Great location walking distance to most things,and if not it is right on the bus line.
Very clean staff is wonderful. My only issue is if you are traveling on your own-this is a group hotel. They take in a lot of large groups.",4,2019,01,08
248,An old school hotel experience ,"We came up to Dublin for a short break as there was a price deal on and having stayed here before, we jumped at the chance again as it is the perfect location for getting around Dublin, for relaxing and for meeting family and friends. The staff were fantastic and made our stay a very enjoyable one. Location is great for Theatre( The Gaeity) , Parks( St. Stephen’s Green) and shopping (Grafton Street), all within walking distance. We didn’t have to use our car for the duration of our stay. Highly Recommended ",5,2019,01,08
248,New Years Visit ,Really lovely hotel and perfect location for exploring Dublin as it’s within walking distance from pretty much everything! Room was lovely and really clean. Ouronly issue we had was when someone walked past the door or even down the corridor you could hear everything! But otherwise a perfect visit ,4,2019,01,04
248,Christmas/show/kids/family trip,"Stay with the family at the Camden Court on 22nd December. Stayed overnight for the walking with Dinosaurs show at 3 Arena. Hotel staff at reception were excellent. Very helpful for local information like shopping, where to go etc etc. the hotel itself was great, lovely court yard with many facilities around the hotel. Big car park with access to hotel lifts. Great rates for overnight for car and hotel. Really comfortable stay and enjoyable. Will definitely use hotel again. 10/10 for location ",5,2018,12,24
248,"Great hotel with a great location, just a couple of minutes walk from Luas stop.",Room was spotless. Staff were very pleasant and helpfull.  Breakfast was everything and more you would expect from a hotel of this standard. The location of The Camden Court just a couple of minutes from a Luas stop meant we could get to where ever we needed to go in the city.  We did not try the leisure centre with the pool this time but will definately the next time as it looked fab.,5,2018,12,18
248,"Great Location, front desk was excellent","Rooms are very good, service is very good and location is excellent. Value for money is great.
I had trouble find the hotel parking, a guy from the front desk came onto the street and wait until he seen me and directed me to the parking area......excellent service...wow...thank you",5,2018,12,15
248,"Great location, great bar, great food!",Excellent location in the south side of Dublin with a great bar and multiple dining options.  Also close enough to walk to most of the must-see places in Dublin - except for the Guinness Storehouse which is really cool (take the Hop-On Hop-Off bus to get there).,5,2018,12,13
248,Excellent location for city break .. ,"I have stayed at this fine establishment on a few occasions & I have found it to be a great location for a shopping trip in the capital surrounded by great restaurants & bars in Camden & Harcourt St.  Only a 5 min stroll to major stores in Grafton St & beautiful boutiques in Wicklow St .. The rooms are very comfortable & clean & the breakfast, lunch & dinners are very tasty & great value. My 1st visit was during the Taste of Dublin experience at the Inveagh Gardens & this hotel is ideally located to this great yearly event. The staff were very pleasant & helpful & I found the area very safe.  The pool/sauna area was very well kept & relaxing & parking is also available at a reduced rate for guests.. All in all I have always had lovely time & would always recommend The Camden Court to anyone staying in Dublin .. ",5,2018,12,10
248,Wonderful Staff and a Nice Hotel,Arrived shortly before 2 and were checked in right away. The parking is very good and you can access the hotel from it by lift. The room was not big but had a wonderful king sized bed and it had been refurbished. We ate in the bar and the food came quickly and it was excellent and very reasonably priced. We didn’t have breakfast and had brunch in an eatery called 19 nearby which was worth a visit. Location is good as it is a short walk to Stephens Green. The most impressive part of the hotel was the staff who were all so friendly and helpful. ,4,2018,12,09
248,Dublin stay very comfortable,"We stayed at Camden Court Hotel for 3 nights. Very happy with the accommodation. Very clean with nice touches. A little out of the way but still only a short walk to Temple Bar and other key sites. Nice local restaurants and not too touristy an area. The team were very friendly. Only room for improvement is room had queen bed, would have loved a king. Would stay again",4,2018,12,09
248,Nice hotel and great location ,"Stayed in the hotel for 1 night in the hotel. The rooms are well appointed and cozy. It was quite noisy from the street and very noisy in the corridor outside the room. The food at dinner and breakfast was great. Dinner was certainly not rushed but that was a good thing. Parking is a little confusing. There is a small car park at the front of the hotel but it’s better to use the underground one just past the main entrance. 
The hotel is handy to Grafton Street and Trinity College. 
If I was in Dublin again on business or with family I would certainly consider this hotel. ",4,2018,12,09
248,"Great stay. Lovely pool, parking is very handy, lovely staff. Food quality good. 

Steam room needs an upgrade.","Great stay. Lovely pool, parking is very handy, lovely staff. Food quality good. Location is excellent for shopping and sightseeing, theatres etc. Try to get a room away from the road. Despite being on 4th floor was a little noisy. 

Steam room needs an upgrade.",4,2018,12,06
248,Nice hotel,"Stayed here for a couple of nights, room was clean and had everything we needed, except a fridge. Didn’t use gym or pool unfortunately. Would stay here again although it was a bit of a walk from the centre. 

We stayed on a room only basis so didn’t eat there, although the menu did look good with plenty of choice at a reasonable price.",4,2018,12,04
248,Nice chilled break,"Spent 3 days here in October with my wife. Check in was good and staff helpful and courteous. Room was nice and bed was comfortable, bathroom slightly small but sufficient, toiletries were good. Hotel bar was nice and friendly barman always willing to chat and help with advice regarding local attractions. Bar food was nice. 

Hotel lounge area is very nicely decorated and good for sitting chilling and having a few drinks. The swimming pool is very small and we just left after 5 minutes as locals were just doing lengths so not a pool for just having a leisurely splash about with wife. 

The buffet breakfast is not really a buffet as someone serves you and it is slightly embarrassing having to ask for a second sausage and an extra slice of bacon. I feel the person serving could ask politely how much of each item you required rather than the way it was done. Breakfast was nice and a good selection. Worth mentioning was the healthy fused waters and juices as they were excellent.

Overall we had a good time and Hotel was very good and I would go back . The only negative was being served the items at the buffet breakfast and the pool being busy with locals doing lengths. Not a pool for just having a splash around.",4,2018,12,02
248,Rude,"My friend booked two rooms for us, one for myself and my partner and one for her. We were attending a friends wedding where I was performing the Ceremony. Everything was rushed, as Friday evening traffic was hectic, so my partner gave me his bank card to go to my hair appt, when he checked us in. The hotel were completely rude when he asked to check in without paying on the spot. When he said I was on my way with the card they questioned him if he was sure, and would we definitely pay. They left him into the room, but proceeded to block the door cards and sent a reminder letter to the room. Any way that is hotel policy, so that is fine...even though they were ignorant in how they spoke to him. My main concern is there was no child lock on the window of room 434 on the fou think floor. It opened out completely. I would be terrified of my child was with us. I told the receptionist when checking out. She too was stoney faced rude, and only seemed to take notice when I said I would be reviewing with photo on here. She called a manager. He listened,with an angry demeaner, said it would be fixed and when I mentioned being a mother and teacher and that I would be reviewing, he asked 'Is there anything I could do regarding the  €20 late checkout fee?'. I handed him my card, paid him and left,  appalled by him and the hotel customer service team. Disgusting behaviour about such a dangerous 'mistake'.",1,2018,11,26
248,"Charming accommodations, friendly staff, convenient location",Very nice first stop after a long leg of traveling.   Morning breakfasts are wonderful and the one dinner we had at their restaurant was very good.   We could easily walk to some local bars.   Was also a nice walk to Trinity College and some of the shopping districts....nice location if you like to walk.   Would definitely stay again.,5,2018,11,22
248,Nice stay - best location!,"I stayed for 4 nights at Camden.. rooms are very comfortable and clean. Location is the best which I would recommend if you wan to stay near to main city and pubs.
Though i did not try lunch or dinner but Breakfast had good options.
Very polite and welcoming front desk.

I would absolutely recommend this hotel.",5,2018,11,20
248,"Bit of a nightmare start, but they tried hard to make up for it","Late check in on a cold and rainy night. I go to the room and it is stone cold. I call down to the reception and say that the place is uninhabitable. They assure me that they will bring me “an extra heater” ( obviously they know about the problem). I say, sorry but I’m not going to freeze my behind for a few hours in the hope that it might improve. It’s late, please change the room. To their credit, they did and it was fine, but to be honest disappointing anyway, so I won’t be back.",3,2018,11,19
248,Great Hotel,"We stayed in the Camden Court Hotel for one night on 7th November. A comfortable & clean room, the lobby / bar area bright & clean. Car parking for €10.00 per night. Lots of places to eat and have a drink close by. We would definitely return.",4,2018,11,17
248,Good hotel- great location.,We chose to stay at Camden Court Hotel one night while in Dublin. It was in a good location and the rooms were clean. We were about a 10-15 minute walk from St. Patrick's Cathedral. The entire stay was smooth sailing and I would highly recommend this hotel.,4,2018,11,14
248,Great stay,"Brilliant stay at the Camden Court, excellent staff, lovely hotel.  Common areas are a bit shabby and could be better but excellent apart from that .
Would defo come back at this price point and location",4,2018,11,14
248,Keeping standards up!,"I returned to the Camden Court for a 3 night stay at the start of October. This hotel isn't my first choice when I stay in Dublin but I must say it's becoming one of my regulars again.

Quick and pleasant check in service and the room was very nice; had been recently painted or maintenance completed on it and it was nothing to complain about.

The bar staff are very nice to deal with and I ate there on 2 of my three nights and was very pleased with the food.

Location was ideal and was only a 10min walk in the morning to our offices based on Stephens Green",4,2018,11,08
248,Nice stay....,"We stayed at the Camden Court Hotel for 4 nights in October.  We took the bus from Dublin Airport with no trouble and stopped right across the street.  Hotel is located in a residential area with a easy walk to St. Stephen's Green and Grafton Street and longer to Temple Bar.  All kinds of pubs and restaurants within several blocks of the hotel.

We were on a 10 days bus tour with Gate1.  Our room at this hotel was the smallest of our entire stay.  We booked two nights on our own and requested two double beds.  We had two beds but the smallest twin beds I ever saw.  Every time I turned over it felt like I was going to fall out of bed!  The water in bathroom was icy cold.  You had to run and run it in order to get warm.  Coming from the U.S. where we conserve water it totally upset us.  The breakfast was good, but service not so.  Every morning for 4 days had to hunt someone down to get tea.  I almost gave up!

In summary, a good hotel, three to four stars, clean, good breakfast, good location, even though not in center of town but everything at your disposal.",4,2018,11,07
248,Lovely stay,"Lovely stay. The man at reception who checked us in was no nice and accommodating. Pity I didn't get his name to praise him. We checked in late on Sat 3rd of Nov. After a long day at work and a long drive, it was really lovely to be greeted by such a curtious, pleasant and accommodating person. I was very impressed. I'd like to praise all the staff members that we encountered.  They were all very friendly and helpful, from the pool receptionist, to the cleaning lady and the woman who checked us out. Definitely will stay here again. Great location; lovely clean hotel; big bed; parking; pool and above all friendly and very helpful staff.  ",5,2018,11,04
248,Beautiful Hotel,"The rooms are so beautiful, lovely and spacious with great facilities available in the room. Gorgeous lobby and really nice leisure centre. The beds are absolutely incredible, one of the best nights sleep we’ve ever had, so soft and comfortable. 

One issue we had was that housekeeping staff came into our room at 10:30am to begin their turn over, even though we were still in bed and check out wasn’t until 12pm. It was really unsettling. Having worked in the hospitality industry before, I know how unprofessional that is, there is a system for knowing who has checked out already and what rooms are available to be turned over. 

Overall, we really enjoyed our stay and would definitely consider coming back in the future. ",3,2018,11,03
248,Middle of Everything,"A group of us stopped at the Camden Court for the last two days of our tour in Ireland.  A perfect location for business and social pleasures, near the most happening nightlife area.  A modern hotel with good free wi-fi.  Beautifully maintained and cleaned.  Good resuatrants within, and connected to the Bleeding Horse Pub which is not to be missed.  Good transport available at the door.  Coutrteous staff and reasonable rates for the center city location.  A great business center off the lobby.",4,2018,10,31
248,Lovely hotel in a great location ,"We stayed here as it was pretty much the only hotel with a pool in the city centre.

The hotel was lovely. Clean and tidy and modern throughout. The rooms were large and comfortable (family room) and it was located 10 minutes away from all the major attractions (Temple Bar is 15 minutes away).

There is a bus stop outside and a tram stop 5 minutes away that takes you to Guinness Storehouse or Dublin Zoo within 30 minutes. Travel is cheap.

The hotel had a lovely feel to it and the gym, pool area were excellent. 

Staff were also lovely and would definitely stay here again. ",5,2018,10,26
248,Good hotel in excellent location,"I stayed 2 nights here while attending a conference.  Reception were friendly and helpful.  

My room was fine.  I thought it was perfectly nice but very expensive for what it was.  The bedroom was spacious with good WiFi.  I didn't find the bed very comfortable and the shower could have been stronger.  

I ordered room service which was very well presented and tasty.  The breakfast was fine but I'd have liked a wider choice of breakfast pastries.  

Overall I was content with the stay but given how expensive the hotel was, I would have liked more attention to detail.",4,2018,10,24
248,Long weekend,"Also stayed earlier in the year, great customer service. All staff efficient and friendly, breakfast superb always get a pot of coffee. Room clean, would have given 5 stars but the broken toilet seat let you down.",4,2018,10,18
248,Rio of hotel,"I've stead here lots of times When it was a 3 star, but now in the last while they have gone to a 4 star, nothing really changed b but double the prices. I also tried booking in last year and they told me the wanted nearly €500 for one night because it was the same night a big band were playing in Dublin, so they lashed up the prices. I won't be staying again, staff and rooms were great tough...",3,2018,10,14
248,Nice Property Neat St. Stephens Green,"Stayed here during the Pope's visit to Ireland. Very nice and clean property that had a wonderful buffet breakfast. It is a couple of blocks from the newer LOAS tram stop, which will get you into the Temple Bar area fairly shortly, after a change. Otherwise it's about 25 minutes walk to get there.",4,2018,10,13
248,Excellent Service,"Can't say enough about the staff and the overall experience we had there. Personalized service, a great lobby vibe (very social) and excellent breakfast every morning. Rooms are of course European sized and it isn't a five star hotel but I'd stay here again on my next trip to Dublin.",4,2018,10,08
248,Nice Hotel,"Very welcoming arrival from reception staff whilst staying for 2 nights over the weekend with four other couples to celebrate our friends 40th Birthday. Check-in process very straight-forward and double room was clean and functional. Windows only open a slight amount and had to turn the radiator down as there was no Air Conditioning in the room meaning we were hot the following morning.

Breakfast is a little hit and miss. On both days there was plenty of choice of hot and cold food but had to chase around for cutlery and coffee cups. Coffee offered at the table wasn't up to scratch but they had a coffee machine near the food and a lovely little coffee stand directly outside the restaurant which made wonderful Lavazza coffee based options.

Bathroom was very clean although the shower leaked and wasn't great for a 6' man but did the job none-the-less.

Lounge area is light and airy and nice to spend time waiting for friends, as well as having a drink during the afternoon and/or evening.

Great location for visitors to Dublin with Temple Bar and various other areas/attractions within easy walking disance.",3,2018,10,08
248,Great location likely more a 3.5/5,This hotel is quite functional. It has little if any atmosphere. The staff are good and helpful. The location is quite nice and there a number of good restaurants/bars in the area. Easy walk to wherever. Rooms are small. Clean.  Beds were same functional but the duvet was synthetic so it was not comfortable.  Breakfast was decent and included. as was coffee. ,3,2018,10,07
248,Nice hotel,"We stayed for 3 nights at this 4 star hotel. The staff were nice and helpful, the room good and clean. Quite good breakfast.  It is on the south side of the city and a 15- 20 minutes walk from temple bar area. I can recommend this hotel!",4,2018,10,06
248,Excellent service,"Staff were very welcoming and accommodating. The location, while central and easy to access popular spots, we had lots of noise at night. Maybe too central? Our room was comfortable and spotless. If you are a night owl, this could be the place for you!",4,2018,10,02
248,Can't fault it at the price-point,Stayed here one night in August.  It's clean and functional but a bit heartless - a 'plastic' hotel as if it should be part of a chain.  If you're looking for a clean room and good service you can't fault it.  Staff were good and the food was good. Location is a bit edgy and it's a few streets away from the main 'happening' areas.,4,2018,09,29
248,Disappointed- ,"The location of the Camden Court Hotel has us all thrilled for our Dublin adventure- 
From the moment, we arrived it was not the warm Irish hospitality welcome we had come to appreciate. 
The front desk staff was unpleasant, abrupt and had a poor eye for detail-My husband presented a copy of our reservation for the check in process- they gave us someone else’s room- the couple who’s room we were given were told, they had no reservations! Needless to say- after getting a call, while we were out that there was an issue with our reservations and we needed to come back- the error they made was corrected-the abrupt, rude presentation was not appreciated. We spoke to the front desk manager who gave us a reluctant apology, only after we showed him our paperwork, we presented to check in-

!Please make sure you print out your reservation! and keep it throughout your stay!!
The room was clean- however very noisy - the courtyard in the middle was a spot for smokers- which was a problem for us- 
The morning the check out process- we were greeted by a gentleman who was abrupt - not a pleasant word. Reluctant to answer questions about our bill-hmm-the extra charge still is on our credit card. We will continue to monitor 

The location was perfect- a nice walk to a lot of attractions and restaurants which were lovely. 
However, we would not stay there again-I think a minimal standard of politeness matters-",3,2018,09,24
248,Central location ,"The location was great as we were able to hoof it to almost every site in the city.  We got one of those hop on and hop on buses that was waste of money because everything was so close.  We didn’t eat there but the lobby was nice and was always busy.  The room was nice and they had pretty good coffee in the room.  You also get a couple of bottles of water everyday which is much appreciated.

The downsides:  
1. no air conditioning!  There is a fan.  The window does open so we were able to get some air and it was cool enough.  Thankfully we faced the parking so noise was not an issue.  

2.  I don’t like these European tubs where you step up and you have this glass half partition.  Water got everywhere and you had to be super careful not to slip.

3.  The hairdryer is in the desk drawer!  Who knew?",4,2018,09,23
248,Sisters trip,My sister and I arrived around 10:30 in the morning and our room was ready.  We checked in and headed out to explore. About 10 minute walk to Grafton street and shopping. If you don't mind walking you can walk everywhere in the city. It was a wonderful stay. The chocolate twists at breakfast are great. No air conditioning. We had the windows open all of the time. The only problem was noise from the bar area sometimes.,4,2018,09,20
248,Lovely,"A couple blocks off the beaten path, Camden Court is a lovely choice. The rooms are small but very well-appointed. The modern bath had plenty of room to stash your stuff. Breakfast had everything you might want and the coffee was plentiful. There are two well-reviewed restaurants onsite, but we chose to go exploring. I'd stay here again!",5,2018,09,17
248,First stop in Ireland,"The Camden Court Hotel was our first stop on our first visit to Ireland.  We were pleasantly surprised when we were able to get into our room at 9am, having arrived on a 7:15am flight. Nice, clean room and a great buffet breakfast.  About a 15-20 minute walk to Trinity College. The LUAS tram system is right around the corner from the hotel. People behind the desk were helpful and attentive.  Our only issue was our room was on the backside of the hotel which we thought would be quiet but it backed up to a parking lot and at night we heard either recycling or garbage trucks dumping their loads.",4,2018,09,16
248,A very nice hotel in a great location!,"The Camden Court is a very nice hotel located near the best of Dublin, just off the main streets, quiet.  This is also one of the few hotels that has a pool, a definite advantage for families.  I would stay here again when in Dublin.",4,2018,09,15
248,Few days away,"Lovely clean room, very spacious and nice comfortable beds, pool area very clean and relaxing towels are provided, also very near to Dublin shops and bars. We didn’t have breakfast here so can not comment it",4,2018,09,15
248,Hen party weekend,Fabulous hotel and excellent staff. Great breakfast. Lovely cosmopolitan atmosphere to this hotel. Amazing location. This place is a gem and I would definitely stay again. Triple room was very spacious. Thanks again for everything. ,5,2018,09,12
248,Will Stay Again,"My Boyfriend booked us in for a night and I loved it, I have a coffee machine in my room which I was delighted with, He went to the gym, The manager Robbie was really helpful, The Gym was quiet and loads of machienes for him. I booked in for a treatment package into the Spa cloud 9. My therapist Ella was so nice and gave an amazing facial. My skin feels great 2 weeks later.The food in the Iveagh looked amazing but we had booked dinner in town so I can comment. Over all it was a really night hotel and great memories with amazing staff all round. Thanks Guys X",5,2018,09,10
248,Hen weekend ,Cant recommend this hotel enough! Great location. Beautiful rooms. Nice breakfast. It really ticked all the boxes. Georgi and Manuel on the reception desk were so kind and accommodating also. They really welcomed us on arrival and couldn’t do enough for us!!,5,2018,09,09
248,Perfect hotel when visiting Dublin,"This first class hotel is on the south side of Dublin. 
Centrally located. Friendly staff. Room casually neat and updated. Comfortable beds. 2 complimentary bottled water. Breakfast buffet average fare. Restaurant option good. Good, free wi-fi speed.",5,2018,09,04
248,Beautiful hotel,"This is a beautiful hotel, lovely and clean with very friendly and helpful staff. Situated about 10-15 minute stroll from temple bar this hotel is away from all the main pubs. There are restaurants and bars within minutes walk of the hotel, but I wished we had esten in their restaurant as the food looked great. Highly recommended for couples, families. Nice to see no hen or stag parties",5,2018,09,03
248,Lovely hotel good leisure facilities,"We found the staff pleasant and welcoming. Our room on the quiet side of the hotel was clean and well appointed. One criticism would be the lack to air conditioning in our room, the room was warm and we had to regulate the temperature by opening the window, which brought in some of the late night noise from the surrounding streets. This would have been worse had our room been on the noisier side of the hotel. 
Breakfast was generally good value for money and offered a wide range of warm and cold options with plenty of fruit on offer.
I selected the hotel due to its high score on Expedia and also because of its leisure centre, specifically its pool, sauna and steam rooms - these facilities are excellent enabling guests to take exercise during their stay.",4,2018,08,28
248,Good location,Camden Court Hotel is a fairly large hotel with good clean and comfortable rooms. It’s nice and quiet when in the rooms. Very good breakfast served. Nice and clean swimming pool. Great location if you are after bars and restaurants within walking distance. Would definitely recommend it if you are staying in Dublin.,4,2018,08,20
248,Nice hotel with good service,"We enjoyed our stay here and the staff was helpful, friendly and efficient.  It's a little away from some of the popular attractions in Dublin, but you can catch a taxi or the city tram.  It was warm when we were there though and air conditioning would have been nice.",4,2018,08,19
248,Lovely place well located,"The staff there were lovely and helpful.    . The place was designed beautifully and felt very homey and Clean. The rooms were spacious, cozy and fitted all our requirements . We had a beautiful city view. We had a wonderful stay. 
",4,2018,08,14
248,Can’t fault this hotel,"Stayed here with a group of friends,we had two family rooms and a twin. The family room was spacious with 3 very comfortable beds. The room was clean and although the hotel was very busy the room was quiet and we weren’t disturbed during the night.

Breakfast was great,a large selection of items and all fresh. 

Check in and out were quick and easy with friendly staff and the bus to/from the airport stops right outside.",5,2018,08,12
248,Impressive service,"This hotel is centrally located and within walking distances of most sights in Dublin. The rooms are large, clean and for the most part quiet. Avoid, if possible, rooms facing the street as bar activity is noisy.  But the real asset of this lovely hotel is its staff. The receptionists were ready with answers to all questions for our party of 15 and especially, Dorian, who was extremely helpful on several occasions. He symbolizes what hospitality should be. 

But the dining manager and staff deserve credit too for arranging our special anniversary dinner accommodations and a breakfast to go for early departures. And last but not least, a special thank you to the housekeeping staff who responded to numerous requests. Thumbs up to all!

",5,2018,08,12
248,"Excellent Stay, Great Value","We appreciated many things about this hotel.  Prior to arrival, Katie in Reservations was outstanding—very professional, responsive, and helpful as were the other staff members on site.  The Family Room we booked was very spacious, clean, and comfortable. The only caveat is for travelers who need quiet. The Camden is located on a very busy, noisy street. But there are many good restaurants and pubs in the immediate area and the Web link that the hotel provided with dining recommendations was excellent. Despite the busy location of the hotel, we highly recommend a stay here.  It was an easy 1-1.5 mile walk to significant sights. Also, it was very convenient to catch a bus to Dublin airport right outside the hotel (only 7 euro per person!)",5,2018,08,08
248,Nice location easy walk to dublin castle.  good food.,"Quite rooms, good food, lots of tour companies use the hotel since it is reasonably priced, and close to most attractions.  We walked to Dublin castle from there without any problems.  The fish and chips were great, breakfasts were very good too.",4,2018,08,06
248,"Great Walking Location, Fitness Facilities.","Camden is a good choice for location. Access to Grafton Street is behind the hotel, which is great for shopping, dining and the Temple Bar Area. Also, it wasn’t too far of a walk to Guinness. Interesting neighborhoods along the way. 

Our room was quite large. Bathrooms require an update, as does the hallways leading to the rooms, but were clean. If you are from the U.S., this hotel is not Air Conditioned. Ireland and the U.K. were in a heat wave. Sleeping at night was a bit uncomfortable, the windows opened, minimally. Just enough to let in street noise. The rooms did have a fan.

The breakfast was underwhelming. It was served cafeteria style, complete with trays, by servers. I felt like I was back in elementary school. 

The hotel does offer umbrellas when it’s raining. 

Overall, it’s a fine hotel for a couple of days stay. I’d want something more comfortable with better dining, for anything longer.",3,2018,08,06
248,Well located and really comfortable beds,"We stayed for one night without breakfast, the rooms were very comfortable except that the bedroom didnt have air conditioning. Check in staff were excellent and parking is a big plus, would we return? yes",4,2018,08,06
248,My go to hotel.,"Whenever I’m required to stay in Dublin I always check the Camden Court. Two main reason, the value and the customer service. I’ve never had one single issue with my stay and I’ve stayed there about 4 times there in the last 12 months. Rooms are basic but beds are comfortable. Dublin is extremely pricey when it comes to hotels. But Camden Court has always stayed true with value for money which is why I always stay there. ",4,2018,08,06
248,Great Hotel,We stayed here 2 nights. The Air Coach transfer from the airport to the hotel was extremely convenient as the stop is right near the hotel. We recommend buying the Hop On and Hop off tour with the Air Coach transfer from the airport to save some money. Camden street has a good night life but overall this hotel is a 10 to 15 minute walk from Trinity College / Temple Bar / Grafton St.. Reception was friendly and breakfast was very good.,4,2018,08,04
248,Handy for city break ,I really liked this hotel and found the staff to be very professional and welcoming on my stay. It's in a perfect location and only a short walk to the likes of Grafton street and St Stephens green. I did not eat here but walking through the bar and restaurant people seemed to be happy enough with their food and it did look like a good menu. I have already recommended it to friends and family who have all gave it the thumbs up. ,5,2018,07,31
248,Improved on my last stay,"I stayed in the Camden Court back in April (see previous review) and have not stayed again until a two night stay in early July. I was put up on the 5th floor and it was certainly an improvement on my last stay. The room, while still a little tired in decor, was clean and tidy and the bed was comfortable. The shower was in the bath but had a glass partition. Any of the staff I had dealings with during my two nights were very friendly and courteous.

There is no A/C in the rooms in this hotel, I had access to a fan in the room and used it. The weather during this week was exceptional for Ireland so it's never something I'd complain about :)",3,2018,07,30
248,Great but Noisy at night,"Pros:  
We loved the location - walking distance to the fun tourist areas; 
Clean, cozy in the common areas and the rooms
Great looking room.  I could live in it!

Cons:
All of the cons are related to the lack of the A/C in the room.  
Like most hotel in Ireland, this one doesn't have an air conditioner (only chain hotels that need to uphold certain standards install A/C).  While it's cool enough with an open window, nothing shots out the outside noise.
There is a bar downstairs with an outdoor area.  The partying goes well into the early morning.  The noise level is tremendous. We couldn't fall asleep.  Perhaps there are rooms on the other side of the building.  However, in addition to the noise from the bar, there are buses and ambulance sirens and police all night long.
Since you need to keep the window open and air flowing in, you can't close the drapes. I didn't realize before my visit that the sun sets after 11pm and rises at 6 am in Summer.",3,2018,07,26
248,Lovely room but hot & stuffy,"We stayed for one night with two small children, so were happy that we could park the car on site and that check in was quick and easy.

Our room was spacious and a great baby cot was provided for my son. We thought the Orla Kiela toiletries were great. 

The only downside was that it was terribly hot with no air conditioning and our window would only open 5cm. The small fan in the cupboard did nothing. We’re Australian so are used to hot weather but I was so hot and stuffy in that room I actually checked that the heater wasn’t on by accident (it wasn’t). This hotel was the most expensive night of our 4 week trip so this was pretty disappointing.

The lobby seems to have been recently renovated and is quite impressive and modern. The management needs to extend this treatment to the upstairs hallways as they seem quite dim and dingy by comparison.

We visited the gym and indoor pool and enjoyed the facilities.

We had breakfast included and the selection of food were terrific, and there was a baby chair available for my son. 

The front desk staff were very accommodating and allowed us a slightly later check out which we appreciated.

The location was great, we walked to all the sights and Camden st had a lovely atmosphere. We had dinner at Devitts pub and lunch at Gerry’s cafe nearby.

",4,2018,07,25
248,Staff were exceptionally helpful.,"Clean, well appointed room. Great location for walking to various attractions. Neighbourhood seemed safe. Best part of the stay was the very helpful caring staff who went out of their way to accommodate our needs and wishes.",5,2018,07,24
248,Reasonable place to stay,I stayed in this hotel in July. It is located within walking distance to the Temple Bar. Stuff is friendly and polite. Breakfast was good with good variety. There is SPA facility and swimming pool which was nice. There is also steam room and a sauna. Room was clean. My only negative point was lack of air conditioning in the room. It was quite warm inside the room considering warm weather outside. I should have check when I was booking if it was available so it is my fault that I stayed there but considering the price AC should be available. Otherwise if you not bother with AC it is very good place however I am not going to stay there again till they have AC.,4,2018,07,23
248,Great hotel,"Just back from night here. Hotel was ideal location for lots to do. Room clean and very quiet.Bed so comfy. Breakfast yummy. Staff very friendly. Only fault was 1 broken lift so all customers depending on 1 which was bit annoying....but these things happen!!!
Overall would recommend and would go back",5,2018,07,23
248,Just ok,This hotel is just ok as the title goes.  It is just outside tourist attractions so you will need to walk a bit to get to where the action is. The rooms are clean but the carpet throughout the hallways and rooms are stained.  It does have pool and fitness room.  If you can get past the location and you really just want a clean place to sleep then this will do. ,2,2018,07,19
248,Good location,"We stayed at the Camden Court in Dublin in June 2018.  We paid $463 US for 2 nights. We were able to catch a bus from the airport to drop us off  near this hotel, which was great.

The hotel  is modern, & clean. It is in a good location just five minute walk to St Stephens Green. We walked to Trinity College and Grafton Street (shopping) from this hotel.

There is a Tesco express supermarket just 2 minutes walk from this hotel, which is great for ready made sandwiches and other things you may need.
 
Our room was a family room with a king size bed and a twin bed, it was a good size room for 3 of us. The beds were very comfortable and everything worked. It was clean and had modern furniture.  No air conditioning, we slept with the window open.

The staff was friendly. We were able to get an early check in which was amazing after flying for 20 hours, we needed to sleep.

There is a pub under/attached to this hotel called the ""Bleeding Horse"" it is a traditional pub, very nice during the day and other nights they have a guy playing a guitar in the corner  but on Saturday night it turns into a crazy loud disco pub! Thank goodness we could not hear it from our room.

 Camden Street is a little sketchy with a lot of graffiti and barred up shops after hours, it's best to walk towards St Stephens green to avoid this street.",4,2018,07,17
248,Nice hotel,"During our first stop to Ireland,  we stayed in Dublin. This is a comfortable hotel. The rooms are on the smaller side, and as typical for Europe,  unairconditioned. A fan is provided in the room. We ate in the hotel restaurant for breakfast.  The buffet had many options and all the staples for an Irish breakfast. My mom wasn't feeling well, and when the waitress at dinner (did not get her name) found out, she brought her dry toast and a pot of tea. So thoughtful! This seems to be a popular hotel with tour groups as there were a few staying there when we were. It us also conveniently located near a bus stop and the tram which makes moving around center city easy!",4,2018,07,13
248,Spot on!,"Stayed in the Camden Court Hotel for a business trip.

I arrived at the hotel at around 10am and they found me a room- which was amazing!

The hotel was clean, the staff were friendly and the hotel is in a great location.

One downside is my room didn’t have air conditioning and it was hot day/night!

All in all I would definitely recommend!",4,2018,07,12
248,Excellent stay and professional service!,"We stayed for 3 nights at the Camden Court Hotel. Firstly, Paul at reception was very welcoming, helpful and met all of our requests. The room was very clean and comfortable. Slept very well. Breakfast was fresh and a good choice for vegetarians. Swimming pool facilities were enjoyable. Staff in the hotel generally have a very nice helpful nature. The fish and chips at the hotel are definitely recommended for dinner. Location is perfect for main shopping sites and Iveagh Gardens. Overall, a very relaxing and homely environment. Thanks again to all the staff!",5,2018,07,12
248,Great for a family,"We booked a family room so all 5 of us could stay in the same room so it worked out very well.

I like the location as it’s a bit outside of the hustle and bustle but still a lot going on and a fairly short walk to st. Stevens green.

Service was fine and bar was decent. Breakfast was decent. Kids enjoyed the pool.

The rooms could use some updating but were comfortable enough.

Good for us as family and if they renovate at some point, it’s a great place.

248,Terrible experience at the Camden Court Hotel - bugs in bed!,"Having stayed at the Camden Court Hotel several times while on business and personal trips to Dublin, I recommended that my sister book rooms there for a family reunion.  I stayed there from June 28-July 1 and was extremely disappointed with the cleanliness of the room and the overall appearance of the hotel. The hotel is in serious need of renovation, as well as more helpful and friendly front-desk staff (on my last visit, the staff were very pleasant and helpful, but this has changed.  The worst problem was that due to the heat wave in Dublin at the time, we had to leave the window open (no air conditioning, but that is to be expected in many places in Europe and we did not complain about it).  The room was very noisy and the window provided access to bugs that bit us during the night.  My sister had a worse experience with bugs in her room and when we went to register a complaint, the manager did not give a satisfactory response, refused to investigate the source of the bugs even when showed a photograph of small black bugs on the bed , and actually accused my sister of biting herself.  STAY AWAY FROM THIS HOTEL!",1,2018,07,10
248,Average,Spent one night here at €200 it was expensive so I at least thought we would have air conditioning. Room was so hot hard to sleep. There was a fan supplied but all that done was circulate hot air .Not the cleanest of places .There were 2 of us and only 1 shampoo supplied bit of a let down really.So won't be staying here again just 2 expensive and definalty not 4 star,3,2018,07,10
248,Camden Court Hotel - wee gem!,"Visiting Dublin many years after my last visit to see Buble, my friend booked this for us as she had previously stayed. Lovely clean hotel, friendly helpful staff, fantastic twin room which even had fans provided which was great as it was warm! Lovely pool, and great choice at breakfast. 757 bus from airport stops right outside it so easy to get to and from airport - half hour trip. Very handy. Would recommend.",5,2018,07,10
248,Most expensive hotel stay. Worst night’s sleep we’ve had,"Stayed here (luckily) for one night last Saturday. No air con in room meant we had to open the window (Ireland was unusually warm!). Unfortunately the room was by the side of a busy road, and the noise from this (cars, nightclubs kicking out time, road cleaners etc) kept us up all night.
Best to avoid, or ensure your room is not road side",1,2018,07,10
248,Fantastic two night city break. Room and breakfast.,"This hotel was booked by our family as a treat for our Golden Wedding Anniversary.  The 757 Airport bus terminated across the road from the hotel - ideal!  The reception and dining areas were extremely well appointed and the room was spacious and luxurious with complimentary Orla Keily toiletries.  Tea and coffee making facilities in the room.  Buffet breakfast offered everything you could imagine and service was excellent.
 Reception staff always friendly and helpful.  Hotel is situated approx. 20 minutes walk from the main centre of Dublin.  A courtesy bus was available each morning at 10am go to the nearest Hop on Hop off bus stop - although we found it easy to walk there.",5,2018,07,09
248,Ok,"Bit of a nothing welcome, “have you stayed with us before” no first time, “ok welcome” “can I swipe your card”, just so impersonal.
Room was ok, bathroom quiet nice, all a bit compact.
Go down to the restaurant and that’s where things go a bit wrong. “Oh you’re on your own, sit up there, any seat will do”. As a lone traveller I was made to feel as welcome as a traffic warden, sitting in an area all on my own.
Then you realise that on a company budget of 30 pounds, you can have a starter and main but not a drink or desert, so expensive!
Got to come back next week, can’t wait 😢
Breakfast doesn’t start till 7, sadly I have to leave at 6.50, they don’t tell you 7 when you book.
Nice friendly pub next door thankfully 
I have stayed in many a hotel in the UK, and when a Michelin star restaurant can do slightly less expensive I’ll go there thanks 
Big place is very difficult to be friendly but this is a bit clinical 

",4,2018,07,09
248,Spacious rooms,"Spacious, clean and all provisions provided for. Didn't get to try breakfast. Great location and friendly staff, efficient service able to deal with large groups.
Plenty of bars and restaurants, within 3 min walk. ",4,2018,07,09
248,Weekend break,"Beautiful hotel, easily accessible by car and great location for bars and restaurants. Staff were friendly and helpful. Lobby area very modern in decor and rooms thoughtfully finished. The only downside was the heat in the rooms, it was stifling and there was very little that could be done to make it any better despite the hotel supplying a fan for guests. ",4,2018,07,09
248,Short walk from Center accessible to all sites,The location is excellent with plenty of good food options nearby. The reception staff were very helpful providing maps and tips on what to see and how to get there. The pillows were great as was the breakfast.,4,2018,07,09
248,Convenient and comfy ,Spent a weekend here recently and was very happy with it. The staff were excellent and easy to deal with. It’s a very convenient hotel location wise and is good value. The only downfall being the heat(no air conditioning) but to be fair the hotel provided a fan. Would recommend ,4,2018,07,08
248,Convenient and Local,"We selected this hotel because it was conveniently located at the end/start of the Airlink 757 line as well as being relatively close to our Hertz car rental location. Plus we wanted to be located south of the river. It turned out to be a good choice.  From the hotel, it's about a 15-minute walk away from the hectic touristy centre and the walk is along some nice streets with local shops, eateries, pubs, and small grocery stores. The location feels more like a neighbourhood versus the busy tourist centre.  With so many nice options for food just steps away, including a pub next door, we didn't feel the need to go further for dinner.

The hotel is well maintained and modern but not fancy.  We stayed twice in two different rooms, both on the 5th floor, which we would recommend.  One time facing the quiet courtyard and the another time facing the street side which provides more natural light, but the view is nothing special.  On both occasions, it was quiet and lovely to have windows that we could open for fresh air.  The rooms are fairly spacious and spotless. There's a safe, coffee maker and kettle, but no fridge. 

For a hotel that is outside the city core, we thought it was not great value especially for a mid-week stay and we booked months in advance. 

The airport bus worked well on arrival at 14 euros (2 people) but we opted to taxi back to the airport and it cost 28 euros.  

On a scale of 1 to 5 (highest):
Staff 5
Location 4
Value 3
View 3
Comfort 4
Quiet 5
Cleanliness 5",4,2018,07,08
248,Great location for iveagh gardens and st Stephens green,"Hotel very clean. Bed nice and comfortable, bathroom clean and modern. Staff all friendly.  Car parking onsite. I would have give it a 5 but no aircon in room and we couldn’t open the window as very noisey outside.",4,2018,07,07
248,It was okay...,"Stayed late June into July and while the staff was very nice and helpful, the beds were HARD and they had no air conditioning. We did find a fan which helped but when asked about air in the room they told us that “Dublin doesn’t get this hot normally but you can open a window”. Call me crazy but wouldn’t you guys have the option to at least have it and guests can turn it on if need be?? I don’t want to sleep with a window open and curtains open at night surrounded by other buildings that can plainly see me! Also, there were blood stains on the carpet which was gross! How did the house keeping not see it?? Was it the worst place I’ve stayed at? No... was it the best? No. I personally would go for the Westin which is closer to the shops and the “action” part of the town and where I know the beds will be comfortable. Location wasn’t good either. You are in a lower part of town and it’s a good 20 minutes walk to the closests hop on hop off tour stops and restaurants.",3,2018,07,07
248,nice rooms; well-located,Nice rooms; large lobby.  clean and inviting.  Very nice restaurant for breakfast. Close to attractions.  Only stayed one night and would have liked to have the time to stay longer.  There is lots to see nearby.,5,2018,07,05
248,Nice / Clean Hotel,"Room was nice and clean.  No issues.

Note that the rooms do not have air conditioning.  This probably isn’t an issue normally but this July was hot and we had to open the window.  There is a lot of traffic in the area but there are some good restaurants nearby.

",4,2018,07,05
248,Pre Cruise Stay,A wonderful 4 night stay at this lovely hotel. We stayed in a suite which was very large and beautifully furnished. The indoor pool and gym was a great place to start your day. The reception staff were very welcoming and informative in regard to tourist information. The hotel has a restaurant and a lovely bar and lounges in the large foyer area to relax in. A fifteen minute walk to St Stephens Park and Grafton Street or one stop on the tram which is at the side of hotel. There is a pub The Bleeding Horse at front of hotel and many small restaurants and pubs nearby. We walked to the canal and into the Port one day which was an easy walk through the neighborhood but give yourself an hour. The weather was very warm and as our room wasn't airconditioned we had the windows open and street noise could be heard.  We would most definitely stay at this Lovely hotel again,5,2018,07,03
248,"Good Hotel,  not too far from the Center","Stayed here a s a group of 10. Easy check in and managed to get room for us early.
Good breakfast (did a deal for 12 euros each).
Lovely pool and steam room (Sauna and gym looked good as well). This was a real bonus.
Rooms clean and comfortable, a little hot, but that was more due to the weather (sunny and 27c in Dublin !).
Nice shower and good quality Shower gel, shampoo etc).",4,2018,07,02
248,Perfect hotel for us in a great location,"I can't say enough good things about the Camden Court hotel. Our stay was even much better due to the excellent front desk staff. We arrived around 1:00 in the afternoon after a long overnight flight and got access to our room. I will admit I was a little worried about hearing traffic as we were in a family room and they only have family rooms in certain parts of the hotel. I voiced my concern and the gentleman at the front desk put us on the 3rd floor as opposed to the 2nd floor. The family room was nice in size for 4 of us. We couldn't hear anything from our room. The windows were very soundproof. We slept very well in this room and I am a light sleeper. They had water and coffee for us in the room. The pool and jacuzzi were a very nice bonus. The hotel was a 15 minute walk from Temple bar, the River Liffey, Trinity College and Grafton St.  There were so many stores, restaurants, pubs and atms on the main street close to the hotel.  We went to Croke Park and I was worried we were too far from Croke Park; it was a very easy cab ride to Croke Park and then we walked most of the way back to the hotel. I would absolutely stay here again. The did have some tour groups coming through so the lobby could be busy at times but it didn't bother us. Thank you Camden Hotel staff for making our trip to Dublin so wonderful. We will be back!",5,2018,06,29
248,"Great service, as always!","Very helpful staff, much appreciated! Front Desk service – Excellent
All staff, from entering, cleaners to bar staff VERY Nice and helpful. During past a few years, we have been using this hotel for large group meetings, from booking to organise lunches, and meeting rooms, all went well. Thanks! Will defintely use their services again neext year.",5,2018,06,28
248,Excellent stay,"We came to Dublin for a concert and stayed here for three nights. We found it to be excellent in every way. Our room was on the 5th floor at the back, overlooking the car park. At first we were disappointed but realised it meant it was quiet at night, as the hotel is on a main junction and we felt rooms at the front could have been noisy. The room had no central heating but the window opened and there was a fan provided, so we were comfortable during a local heat wave. Our room, like the whole hotel was spotless and the complementary bottled water each day was very welcome.  Breakfast was standard hotel fare, but hot and fresh. It was served in the main restaurant so it never felt crowded even though the hotel was busy. The bar area is pleasant and prices reasonable. The reception staff were knowledgeable and helpful. The hotel is across the road from the start/finish stop of the 757 bus from the airport which was very convenient and it is a comfortable walk into the main city attractions. Overall I highly recommend the Camden Court and will stay here on future visits to Dublin.",5,2018,06,26
248,Brilliant!,"My wife and I and two other couples have just returned from a one night stay - we cant recommend the hotel, the staff, the service - EVERYTHING - you wont be disappointed - thanks to ALL the staff that made it a memorable stay - including the twins in the bar!! You two guys are great!",5,2018,06,25
248,Overnight stay,We stayed here for a night and were greeted at the reception desk with a very friendly member of staff who showed us how to get to the Aviva stadium by drawing a map for us.. the room was impeccable.. very clean and spacious. Complimentary bottled water and tea and coffee was included. The bar and restaurant staff were friendly and helpful too and our breakfast was delicious. We will definitely stay again when we visit Dublin. Well done Camden Court Hotel.,5,2018,06,25
248,3 bed family room - hard to come by !,"We were in one of the large family rooms with 2 doubles and a single after a long haul flight - so it was cosy but everything we needed for everyone to get an great sleep - quiet, clean and comfortable.  We also ate dinner and breakfast in house and they too met our expectations for eating in a hotel like this.",4,2018,06,25
248,Convenient South Dublin location ,"Convenient location on South side of Dublin. 20 minutes walk to Temple Bar area, Grafton Street shopping,  and/or Trinity College. Small rooms. Clean. Average hotel restaurant. Good pool. Nice, but not great. Might try somewhere else next time.",3,2018,06,24
248,Great location and nice hotel,"Great feel in the lobby of this hotel. Also most importantly lovely rooms, clean and nice ensuites. Staff helpful and a great location. I would definitely recommend for anyone wanting to explore central Dublin.",5,2018,06,23
248,Dublin tour stop ,"The rooms are four star quality. The food provided for our group dinner was very bad, elected not to eat it. They should just setup an Irish buffet dinner and go with that. A few staff members were less than friendly but some were very friendly. Price for breakfast buffet is too expensive for quality and what is offered at 16 euro per person. A very clean hotel. I give it a 3.5 out of 5.",3,2018,06,22
248,Good locaton,The location is great for this hotel.  Next to rail and easy access to bus system.  Located well within walking distance to many restaurants.  Hotel caters to many tourists on group tours on buses and tourists on cruise ships.  Many people stay for one or two nights only.  No air conditioning in rooms.,3,2018,06,21
248,Excellent stay,A very pleasant hotel in a lively area of south Dublin away from the tourist hourds. I'll be back with the family whenever I have the time/opportunity. The Camden area of Dublin is new to me but is very cosmopolitan.,4,2018,06,18
248,Very nice hotel with excellent amenities,"We were impressed with Camden Court -- a great value for the price.  The rooms were good-sized, clean, and modern.  The location is only about a 15-20 minute walk to the Temple Bar area.  There is no air conditioning, but you can cool down the room by opening up the window. I would definitely recommend,",4,2018,06,18
248,"Nice location, pool great for families, so-so value","This hotel was tougher for me to rate becauseI wanted to like it more. It's an older building, but unlike some other Dublin hotels just doesn't have the ""charm"" so it just feels old. Rooms were clean and the bed comfortable. Other thoughts:

Pros:
- Location is very good, several good restaurants within minutes, can get to other popular areas within a 15-20m walk.
- Pool is nice for kids, not many hotels in Dublin with a pool. Pretty good size as well.
- Gym is pretty decent - not modern, but good size for a hotel and has free weights, cardio and machines.
- I didn't eat there, but the restaurant seemed very popular every night.

Cons:
- Wall insulation is bad, though not uncommon for older Dublin buildings. If someone is having a conversation in the room next to you, good luck sleeping.
- No A/C so upper floors get really pretty toasty. Leaving the window open all night is not an option due to noise. They do give a rotary fan, which is better than nothing and helps with the previous problem of adjacent noises. 
- Pool and gym are ""shared"" with non-guests who can buy a membership.
- Big tourist hotel with seemingly buses rolling in daily, got really packed at times and basically gave up using the elevator (and I was on a higher floor) because you'd wait way too long (only 2 elevators).

Staff and customer service was ok - they did their job but weren't overly ""warm"". I travel a lot and don't agree this is a 4-star hotel, I'd rate it more of a 3 just given how dated it is; pricing seemed a bit high for what you get but it is the peak season.

Overall, I probably wouldn't stay here again unless me or my family really were insistent on having access to a hotel pool and gym. Fair hotel and location was great, but just wouldn't pay this much for older rooms with no A/C.",3,2018,06,17
248,Average,"We stayed at Camden Court hotel for two nights on the tail end of our Ireland trip. There was nothing terribly wrong with this hotel but don’t think it should be considered four star.

Check in/out was efficient, the room was clean, although not particularly updated.  The shower did leak a lot of water but the front desk notified maintenance as soon as we notified them.

The hallway corridors are more what you would find in a low category Fairfield Inn and were in need of some updating. Guest drinks and bottles were in the hallway next to many rooms. There is no soundproofing and you could hear every conversation as you walked by people’s rooms. The WiFi worked fine for us with no issues.  

The breakfast buffet was just ok and at times wasn’t kept up. The first day we sat for a long while and had to ask a server for some coffee. 

This hotel has a pool so if you are a family looking for amenities this might work well for you. We preferred the quieter more historic Buswells hotel across town. 

Again, nothing terribly wrong but thought the hotel was a bit average for the price. ",3,2018,06,13
248,"Amazing stay, amazing staff - just wonderful!",I can honestly say that this hotel lived up to the price and fulfilled all expectations and more. The staff in particular were extremely helpful and always on hand. I will be returning to this wonderful city later on in the year and I wouldn't dream of staying anywhere else than the Camden Court Hotel. Thank you guys and see you soon!,5,2018,06,13
248,Decent stay,"The staff is fairly helpful and the rooms are clean. Pretty much your average hotel, good for a couple nights while visiting Dublin. Both of our room keys deactivated one day. The parking garage is not marked very well and there are only a handful of spaces in the car park behind the hotel.",3,2018,06,06
248,A gem in Dublin,"I cannot tell you how impressed I am with the staff of this hotel.  Friendly, accommodating and eager to please.  The room was a little small but ok.  The bath was wonderful with great water pressure and well laid out.  Bed was comfortable but it was bloody hot in Dublin and, of course, there is no air conditioning.  While we were supplied with a fan it wasn't adequate to keep the room cool (we were on the warm side of the building.  Breakfast was wonderful with both hot and cold selections of wonderful meatts, cheeses, eggs and cereals.  And while, with the exception of air conditioning the facilities were great the staff was superb.  And, btw, the location was such that we could walk anywhere in Dublin easily and quickly.  Thank you Camden Court for a wonderful 3 day stay!",4,2018,06,05
248,Hit and miss WIFI,"Wellness center  and has sauna and steam roof lockers etc. Rooms nice - beds are comfortable location is good.
However windows don’t open far - no AC they don’t tell you there is a noisy fan you can use.  Cab ordered was wrong size. Young man at front desk was surly and almost rude. Ladies at desk were helpful.

WiFi was spotty dropped signal and was the worst",3,2018,06,05
248,Good hotel for wheelchair,"This hotel has twin room for wheelchair.  It is pretty well located in walking distance to Temple Bar area, shopping and a short taxi ride to other attractions.  The room was good, but a few silly things in the bathroom need attention.  The tap has to be swung right round to get hot water, so water is splashing on you in the wheelchair.  Need more grab rails in the shower area.  This is an old hotel, but kept fairly well.  Staff were friendly, helpful, and got us a wheelchair taxi a few times.  A pub right out the front.  I would stay again.",4,2018,06,03
248,Great hotel for a weekend in Dublin,"The hotel is about 20 mins walk into the centre of Dublin. We enjoy walking so it wasnt a problem for us but for others you may wish to get a taxi. There is a pub right next door to the hotel and there is a tesco express not too far. The hotel is nice, staff are helpful and the room is clean and comfortable. Breakfast is ok, standard Irish breakfast available with some fruit, meats, breads, cereals etc. Pastries werent great though. Overall good value for money, would stay again.",4,2018,06,03
248,Good wellbeing centre including swimming pool ,"I make a habit of coming here when In Dublin to ensure I get a swim in. It’s 12 Euros + 1 E for the use of a towel. if your not staying at the hotel they like you to phone ahead and tell them you intend to come by to use the pool and spa. 
The swimming pool is a good length for hotels and there is a sauna and a steam room complete with hot tub. You are best to ring to ensure water aerobics isn’t happening. 
The changing rooms are clean as is the pool, staff are always helpful. 
It’s nice to get a coffee upstairs which is smartly decorated and comfortable furniture. ",4,2018,05,31
248,Negative experience,"Bad experience-no air conditioning, not enough fans to provide each room, rude staff including guest service management & restaurant staff. Had to wait 20 mins for breakfast while there were many open tables due to staff overwhelmed due to large tour groups.",1,2018,05,31
248,"Friendly, helpful staff","Enjoyed our stay for 3 nights. Clean & comfortable room on sixth floor. Quiet.
Would recommend the Camden Court Hotel and would stay here again when
we return to Dublin.  Within walking distance for all we wanted to see & do.
Enjoyed to restaurants that were recommended that were close by.",4,2018,05,30
248,"Great experience, worth a visit","Stayed at the Camden Court with my wife for the Pro 14 rugby final. On arrival the hotel reception staff were very friendly and efficient, even though we arrived early on the day, we were checked in, which was fantastic. The room was spotless and couldn't be faulted so we dropped off the bags and went to the reception to have a look around. The hotel had a real buzz about it, there are numerous pubs and restaurants all with in a short walk of the hotel. I couldn't fault the hotel and my thanks to the reception staff for making it a great stay. We will be back....",5,2018,05,29
248,Hotel staff AMAZING!,"Coming from the US we arrived at the Camden Court at 7:30am from a long flight and took a chance asking the front desk if we could check into our room. To are amazement they accommodated us! This allowed us to nap and start our trip off right. However, that evening our room was extremely loud due to the fact that it was Saturday night and above a nearby bar. The next morning we asked if we could switch to a quieter room and again we were immediately accommodated. They even provided us umbrellas for the rain! 

Breakfast was worth the 12 euros per person. 

The hotel itself definitely shows its age and is somewhat far from restaurants and shopping. However, Har court train station is only 2 blocks away. 

Overall 5 star service and we would recommend as a mid tier option! ",4,2018,05,28
248,Camden Court,"Not the cheapest hotel, but compared to others we looked at, this was a steal! This hotel was within walking distance (half hour) to everything we wanted to see including Book of Kells, St. Patrick's Cathedral, and Guinness Storehouse. The room was clean and comfortable and even had a plug in fan (we like white noise, so this was very helpful, and hotels in Ireland don't seem to use sheets, so you only ever get a heavy comforter, a fan helped keep us cool).  Breakfast was good but overpriced, if you have time to go someplace outside the hotel, find a good cafe, there are plenty around.  The pool, hot tub, sauna, and steam room were amazing!  Next door to the hotel was a great pub called the Bleeding Horse, plenty of good food choices around. We would choose this place on our next stay. ",5,2018,05,26
248,"Rave Review to Staff, Restaurant, Bar, and Room","For our final night of our 11 day ""Are We There Yet?"" tour of Ireland, we were made to feel genuinely welcomed. Nine of us sat at a raised table in the sports bar area, drank our fill of Guinness, ate way too much bar food, and watched an entire football match including 7 minutes of OT. We were waited upon, but never made to feel that we needed to order more than we did--very civil they were.  Our room was very nice; our second floor room had windows (with flower boxes in bloom) over Camden Street. Views of the hustle and bustle were nice, even with window open...not a problem. Everything aside, this will tell you about the staff and their pride in serving their customers--even once they have left--for home in Florida.  On day 3 getting settled at home, we realized that our ""over the bathroom door,"" behind the door & out of view, we had not packed our toiletry bag ++.  Undaunted, my wife emailed customer service at the hotel and explained what room we had been in, the description of what we had neglected to bring home, and asked whether they could be of assistance.  The next day they communicated back that they had located it in their Lost and Found...they apologized profusely that they would have to empty all liquids...but that they would mail it to us - in America - at their own expense (€7). How's that for going the extra mile.  If ever in Dublin, we will definitely be back.",5,2018,05,26
248,"Comfortable, well located hotel","We were pleased with the room, the location and the service provided by staff.  It's within walking distance to Trinity College and the Castle.  The neighborhood feels like it is gentrifying and there are numerous restaurants, pubs and coffee shops just outside the door.",4,2018,05,24
248,Amazing hotel and amazing staff,"First off this is very nice hotel, great food, and a wonderful staff.

But it went beyond that for me, I live in Los Angeles and was over in Ireland for an extended stay visiting family. I was injured in Dublin and after spending two days in the hospital had to change hotels as I needed a lift, no stairs and a place that had breakfast.

The staff here, Blanca, Owen, Katherine, Rudu, Nazir(you really helped me my friend), Monica, Georgie, Alexandra...sorry if I am leaving anyone out, this is from memory and I just got home to LA....these people went above and beyond for me, I was on crutches and in a lot of pain, and quite frankly scared, my relatives in Ireland were hours away and I was 7,000 miles from home...they checked on me, went to the pharmacy for me, treated me like family....I will never forget their kindness, they kept saying 'no problem' and ""it's our job""...actually it wasn't you people went way above that.

I am in Ireland often these days, and would stay there again and HIGHLY recommend them, besides from all the help they gave me, it's a great hotel.",5,2018,05,24
248,Very nice and comfortable hotel ;),"Very nice hotel in walking distance from the city center. The hotel have good fitness room and a very nice swimming pool area. Good selection in breakfast buffet with choice of quality food and pro cooking  Our room clean and comfortable with good bed. Great coffee machine in the room :)  The hotel staff was helpful and professional.   Thanks to all staff, we will stay at this hotel again ;)",5,2018,05,24
248,Disgusted!!!,"We stayed at the Camden Court hotel Easter weekend 2018, on arrival the hotel seemed nice and staff relatively friendly.
We arrived on the Friday and Saturday morning the cleaners knocked on the door really early asking to clean the room, I replied that we hadn’t used anything in the room yet and would I be possible to leave it, she insisted that she come back when we left, I let her know that we would be leaving in 10 minutes. 
In my jewellery bag I had a Tiffany’s bracelet worth around £150, this bracelet was stolen from my bag whilst we were out during the day!
When this was reported the duty manager informed me that ‘this has never happened before’ and was quite dismissive of my claims to start with, he told me that he would be contacting the police ‘if I am sure’ which I am.
My bracelet did not leave the hotel all weekend, this is the only thing I am aware of being stolen. Absolutely gutted, I received this as a gift for my 21st birthday and I’m absolutely disgusted that something like this has ruined our trip, which we were very excited for! 
Refrained from writing a review but the fact that this was two months ago and the hotel have still not returned my email or contacted me back following a phone conversation with the manager I am disgusted! Never again!!!!!",1,2018,05,23
248,Great hotel in walking distance from Dublin city center,After my reservation at the PREMIER SUITES PLUS Dublin Leeson Street was cancelled less than one week before arrival (by the hotel) I was lucky enough to find this hotel nearby at the same price (and even including breakfast buffet). The hotel is in walking distance from Dublin city center and has a fitness room and swimming pool. Also friendly staff and fast check-in/check-out. I can recommend it,4,2018,05,23
248,Convenient location,Good central location only 10mins walk from the centre of Dublin. Lobby and bar area are very nice and reception staff friendly. Rooms have been updated since the last time I stayed here and beds are very comfy. Only problem was the price was extremely over inflated due to Ed Sheeran and the Rolling Stones being in town,4,2018,05,22
248,Amazing Hotel!,"What a lovely stay at this amazing property. Great location only a couple of min away from the tram line that brings u straight into the city center. Amazing staff, a special thanks to the manager on duty that made sure we had an amazing stay i believe his name is shumbam sacsena.",5,2018,05,21
248,Ed sherran concert ,"Stayed here last night and was really impressed.. on arrival reception staff so so nice and friendly... lobby area lovely and modern and clean.. rooms nice but the only thing I would say is 2 single beds pushed together ?? Bar staff so attentive and friendly also.... location great , close to st Stephens green, Grafton street and of course coppers😂😂 definitely would stay here again 😊",5,2018,05,20
248,Central location,Just back from a night in the Camden court hotel. The hotel was very central and the rooms were lovely. I found the staff to be very friendly and welcoming. Parking was also available in the hotel grounds.,4,2018,05,19
248,"Good location, nice room","This hotel was well located for me to walk just about everywhere I wanted to go in Dublin. It was an easy bus ride from the airport, but I took a cab back as I had an early flight home. The breakfast was quite good and the room was very comfortable.",4,2018,05,18
248,"Great location, nice room, good service","Spent a couple nights here.  You can't beat the location.  Many pubs, restaurants, and shops nearby.  Temple Bar and St. Stephen's Green easily walkable.  Close to tram stops as well.

Large room, comfortable king-size bed, quiet rooms.  Good breakfast buffet and helpful reception staff.  Free wifi throughout.",5,2018,05,13
248,Warm welcome by helpful and friendly reception,"This hotel has a wonderful location  , excellent dining options within walking distance,  My room was clean and comfortable . There is a nice bar and lobby area to relax or work in with a drink and a laptop.Staff were very friendly and helpful. the building was beautifully decorated and the bar/lounge area was comfortable and fun to hang out in - made new friends there.I enjoyed my stay.",5,2018,05,08
248,Great location and nice hotel,"Had a lovely stay at the hotel. The staff were pleasant and helpful including letting us check in early when we arrived which we really appreciated. The room was comfortable, spacious and clean. Only small thing was that there is no air con and on a warm weekend the room got uncomfortably hot overnight. I don't have an issue with road noise at all as it's a city centre hotel but it does mean you can't really keep the windows open so when combined with no a/c it can get uncomfortable but this was a relatively minor issue on what otherwise was a great stay. 

The location of the hotel was excellent, loads of nice bars and places to eat around if you don't fancy Temple Bar which is only a few minutes walk away anyway. ",4,2018,05,07
248,Lovely Spacious Hotel,"Warm welcome by helpful and friendly reception staff.  Hotel facilities clean and spacious, as was our room.  Good gym, pool and spa area.  Circa 15 minute walk into Dublin centre, i e Liffy, Grafton Street, Temple Bar.  Ten euros a night to park car, breakfast circa £10.30 each - suggest good Value as plenty of choice of quality food.",4,2018,05,03
248,"Great location, friendly staff, excellent room",Large and very clean rooms and friendly staff. Delicious coffee and food. Everything we wanted to do on our visit to Dublin was within walking distance. The airport coach stops out front. Sightseeing bus just up the street. Lots of great restaurants on Camden and Harcourt Streets. Cloud Nine Spa worth the treat! We'll stay again.,5,2018,05,03
248,"Good location, helpful staff but not a great hotel",Staying at the Camden Court had its pluses and minuses.  Let's start with the pluses.  Location near St Steven's Green and City Centre is ideal.  The staff was also very accommodating with requests for my child and very friendly.  Hotel itself was the reason for the minuses of my stay.  The fridge provided barely kept anything cold.  My room was also very noisy.  The windows didn't keep out enough noise from the street and the doors were very loud.  If you need to a good night's sleep I would recommend another hotel.,3,2018,05,02
248,Location can not be beat.,"The hotel is located in the best area to get to all of the must sees. Great places to eat,shop and entertainment. The Bleeding Horse Pub is right next door and a fun place.
the hotel's dining is very good and the breakfast is over the top with choices. The beds are super comfy. The room I was in was small but really you are just there to sleep. The Hotel staff are lovely. James helped us the information on everything....Thank You James!",5,2018,05,01
248,Great Hotel,"We stayed here for two nights during our visit to Dublin. It’s in a convenient location, not too far from the airport and about a 20 minute walk from the city centre. The road that the hotel is located on also has lots of pubs on it so you can get a good feel of the local culture. The rooms were a decent size and very clean and tidy. We also had a meal in the bar which had quick  and convenient service. Overall we had a great stay here, would definitely recommend. ",4,2018,04,30
248,3rd time in the city,The 3rd we have been to the city and the Camden as good as the last two great breakfast nice room on the second floor with good free internet access the pool and gym area are both very good and for a hotel the gym big with lots of equipment to use hotel as on site parking that you have to pay for we would and will stay here again keep the hard work up time Camden,4,2018,04,29
248,Girls getaway ,"Loved this hotel . 9 of us stayed in 3 rooms. 2 of the rooms we quite small with 1 double and 2 twin beds . I room had 1 king size and 2 doubles although these were sofa beds very comfortable. Loads of space fridge fabulous coffee and tea facilities. Wish every hotel had same coffee machine pleasant change to the usual uninspired sachets of coffee usually available. 

Bathrooms great well equipped fabulous shower

Breakfast beautifully every day fresh poached eggs heavenly. All presented well and lovely chef on hand to serve . Fruits yoghurt cereal available too. 

Clearly improvement works being undertaken in the public areas did not detract from our experience enjoyment of sitting for an early evening or late night drink . 
 Bar staff excellent 

We ate in the restaurant food fabulous best dinner we had over the whole break . Food perfection. 
Reception staff friendly and attentive welcoming 

Leisure facilities lovely changing rooms could do with some work cold and stark.
Fabulous hotel lovely break thank you 😊 
",4,2018,04,29
248,Worn and old.,"Old and worn hotel. Not worth the 175EUR I paid for one night. Definitely not a feeling of a four stars standard. Food for lunch at the Iveagh restaurant was acceptable.
Staff was nice but not outstanding. Not coming back.",2,2018,04,27
248,Wound up loving it,"We took a family trip to Dublin.  We chose the hotel for location and swimming pool to keep the 6yo kids happy.  Upon arrival, tired and in a new city, the hotel seemed fine although strange because we were in a strange place :)  But, with our stay I appreciated the hotel and the atmosphere more and more, and I'd say the stay made me feel more comfortable in the city.  The lobby was FINISHED during our stay, and usually people hanging out there.  Loved the breakfast and that they'd order a cab for us, etc.  I'd say the place feels comfortable, friendly and happy - not ultimate luxury - but we were happy with clean, safe, friendly and comfortable.  Reading the mixed reviews did make me nervous when booking - but we were pleased overall.  Only thing I can't attest for is summer heat and A/C, we turned the heat on one day and although slow to warm worked well.  Great trip.",5,2018,04,21
248,Great breakfast!,"Very well located hotel in the heart of Dublin. The hotel has been refurbished over the years and the rooms are now quite spacious and modern. Depending on your room, it could be a little bit noisy at times; soundproofing could be improved.
The fitness centre is a bit dated but quite well equiped foe a hotel.
Really nice breakfast with quality products.",4,2018,04,19
248,I'll be slow to come back,"I’ve stayed in plenty of hotels in the last few months both for business and for short personal stays so I understand hotels can vary and never expect everything to be perfect.

I found the Camden Court on this occasion to be below par; I did say this to the receptionist as I checked out Tuesday morning after a two night stay but don’t think my comments will have gone any further.

It’s been a few years since I stayed in the hotel and last time I was there it was in the middle of renovations to both the lobby area and the rooms. Back then the rooms we got were very nice and had been recently upgraded. 

This time when I checked in on Sunday evening work was on-going in the lobby once again (I don’t have an  issue with this as it didn’t impact in the rooms) but the rooms themselves (well mine at least) was not great. 

There was scuff marks on the walls and it just had a run-down feel to it. The double bed was actually two single beds pulled together, I’ve seen this in hotels before but there’s usually either a double mattress or the mattresses are sipped together – not on this occasion, it was very obvious when I was lying in the bed there was two different beds under me as one mattress was not as firm as the other and there was a gap running down the sheet where the two beds should/were meant to have been joined together.

I ate in the bar on both nights and had no issue with the food and the staff were very nice to deal with but I’d be slow to pick this hotel again given the choice",3,2018,04,18
248,Lovely stay at Camden Court Hotel,"The hotel was cozy and clean. The staff was very friendly and helpful. We stayed for two nights and will definitely come back some day. The breakfast was good even though we missed some fresh vegetables. Our room for two was quite big and the king sized bed was very comfortable. The room was cleaned every day properly. Even though the hotel was quite full it wasn't noisy. 

The area of the hotel was full of pubs and restaurants. One of our favorite restaurant was Mad Egg and favorite pub was the Bleeding horse. The location of the hotel is great. You can take Airline bus from and to airport easily. (The bus stop is next to the hotel.) All of the city's attractions are in walking distance. The St.Stephens Green park was lovely.

Warm thanks for the amazing staff who made us feel valued guests. All of our requests were answered right away, we even got to change the room for free (we booked the wrong type of room) and got delayed check out.
We strongly recommend this hotel.",4,2018,04,16
248,Great mid week stay,"Stayed here for 2 nights with my Mum, is in a great location accessible by the local bus ams a short walk into the centre. The front desk staff were very helpful and ans polite. I would advise anyone staying here and flying into Dublin to get the DoDublin pass which includes Airlink which stops outside hotel.

Thanks ",5,2018,04,13
248,Happy return customer,"I had no doubt in my mind to revisit The Camden Court hotel. As usual, great service, great staff, and plenty to have for breakfast. Loved the swimming pool and all the facillities. Will return again!",4,2018,04,11
248,Warm and clean ,Stayed here for two nights over Easter. We arrived late in the evening the staff were very welcoming and helpful. The hotel is spotless and the room we had was lovely and warm . It also had a nice hot pier shower. We did not eat there but the menu looked very good. We definitely recommend this hotel.,4,2018,04,06
248,Great one night stay,"Camden court is such a lovely hotel I was pleasantly surprised. Clean, warm, staff very accommodating and breakfast was amazing. We arrived early and got a check in at 11am. I found hotel to be very central too. Would definitely return and will be recommending to others. Parking for 10 Euro a day was also very convenient.",5,2018,04,06
248,Leading by example ,Thank you for a fantastic stay. Truly a great example of customer service and the hotel is beautiful. A very comfy sleep on a huge bed and dark room blinds made a great night sleep. Breakfast was plentiful and very tasty. Would 100% stay here again when I visit Dublin. ,5,2018,04,03
248,Great location with parking for weekend break in Dublin,"We had a great weekend break in Dublin and the hotel was fantastic. Location was great, only 20-30 min walk from Temple bar area with lots to see on the way. Beautiful hotel rooms with orla kiely supplies in the bathroom which was a lovely touch. We didn't have time to use the spa and pool facilities but will next time! The hotel car parking was an added bonus. We will stay here when we are next in Dublin.",5,2018,04,03
248,Perfect,"This hotel was amazing from start to finish. I cannot wait to return later on in the year. 

The rooms were spotless. The breakfast for 12 Euro each was worth every penny.

The leisure facilities were just so relaxing. What a great way to start you’re day. 

15-20 minutes walk from the city centre. (Temple bar). We just did a pub crawl on our way into the centre.

Again 15-20 minutes walk from the Aircoach bus stop.

Definitely worth a visit.",5,2018,04,03
248,Minibreak,"Stayed for 3 nights beautiful hotel rooms spotless, staff very polite and helpful especially on reception. Breakfast good with plenty of variety also meal we had one night in attached Iveagh restaurant was excellent",5,2018,03,23
248,Six  Nations Weekend,"We stayed at Camden Court for the weekend of the Ireland v Scotland rugby game. The hotel was very busy but well staffed both in reception and in the bar which meant an efficient checkin and  prompt service once we went for our first pint of Irish Guinness in Ireland.
The rooms are of a good standard albeit a bit cold on first arrival until heating kicked in. Spotlessly clean and room service excellent.
The reception/ lounge area was undergoing building work which meant some uneven floors in places but it was well marked and just meant a bit of extra care required.
We had a meal in the bar on the Friday night and it was of good quality and reasonably priced. Breakfast both mornings was well managed with almost no waiting for a table despite being very busy. Tea and coffee orders ware taken immediately and promptly topped up when requested.There was a wide choice of food, cereals and fruit juices. For hot food, a chef serves everyone individually from a wide choice of the usual breakfast items which created short queues at times but it seems to work effectively and the food was excellent.
Overall, whilst we paid the usual high prices for rugby weekend accommodation, we really enjoyed our stay and would have no hesitation in staying here again.",5,2018,03,23
248,Great Stay Every Time,"Great location!  All Staff are exceptional.  We have eaten both in the bar and the restaurant many times and the food is excellent.
Great atmosphere in the Lobby and Bar area.  Which is also great for get togethers in the hotel.",5,2018,03,22
248,"St Patrick’s weekend, great choice!","Booked here for st Patrick’s weekend. It was an excellent choice. 

About a 20 minute walk to the main downtown attractions (trinity, temple bar, etc) - convenient enough to get where you want to go by foot, far enough away from the mayhem of the weekend! 

The pubs located right down in Camden area are much more local experience, live music, and you’re more likely to chat with someone from Ireland than another tourist. So the location is actually better than what you may guess by looking at google maps.  

The hotel staff were wonderful. Given the chaos of the weekend they had early check in ready for us. Gorgeous rooms. Everything we needed.

During check out there was a bit of a snowstorm - and despite the staff having to deal with a whirlwind of problems because of the weather (taxis not showing up for other guests) they still took care of our needs to hold our bags for the day, printing request etc. Very polite. And they moved mountains to take care of the guests who had their taxis to the airports cancel on them. 

All that’s to say is that the Camden staff care about your experience. On one of the busiest weekends of the year for them I was still made to feel like I was the only one in the hotel. 

",5,2018,03,21
248,Great location!! Along with a great staff & service!,"We stayed here for 3 nights St. Patricks weekend. The staff here was excellent.  When we arrived after an overnight flight from the states, all our rooms were ready and we checked in early which was a nice surprise.
We had breakfast in Iveagh, the hotel restaurant, each morning and it was good. They had a very good selection of cold cereals, fruit and breads & pastries.  The hot items were the usual Irish breakfast, sausage, bacon, scrambled & fried eggs, baked beans & tomatoes and black & white pudding.The Bleeding Horse pub next door was very convenient and we had a great casual dinner there - separate review. 

It snowed on St. Patrick's day and the staff handled the craziness with great ease.The place was packed - even the lobby was full of partyers and it was no problem for the staff to handle.

Our room was much larger than the other Dublin hotel we stayed in 5 years ago. The bath was also a nice size and the maids were very attentive to our needs. The location was perfect, We were able to walk to many of the places we wanted to go but if we needed a taxi, the front desk had one there for us in a few minutes.

I definitely would recommend the Camden Court Hotel and if I make it back to Dublin, I will stay here again",5,2018,03,18
248,Superb hotel great location,Absolute quality hotel in an amazing vibrant city. A great pub next door and a nice bar inside the. hotel . Top tip if coming from the airport catch the 757 bus it’s about an hour but stops and collects directly outside the hotel ,5,2018,03,15
248,25th wedding anniversary treat,"Excellent venue which we really enjoyed for a few days. The room was large and comfortable with great coffee maker good size bathroom massive bed.  Hotel providex good dining and wee touches like umbrellas for heading out into the rain. Right beside camden street with lots of pubs like the blessed horse and great restaurants like the excellent ""green nineteen"". Good sized swimming pool and we would recommend a stay. Has car park at 10 euro per night.",5,2018,03,14
248,Building chaos ,"Where do I start? After making a corporate booking for a business trip to Dublin, the hotel failed to let me know that their reception was being refurbished!  Taking into consideration the reception links to the bar and restaurant, someone should have identified that this would be disruptive to guests!  Decorators dust sheets, paint, building workers, uneven surfaces and the replacement of the floor all added to an atmosphere of chaos for both guests and staff.  I witnessed a guest trip on Tuesday morning as she walked in heels and didn't notice the drop in floor level.  Painters were balanced on ladders in the middle of the reception whilst floors were pulled up and ""slippery surface"" signs were hastily moved around the reception.  Apart from the obvious inconvenience we then sat for breakfast listening to the building work in the next room.

As a ""business stay"" this is the worst I have had and will be informing my employer as much.

This is a prime example of a hotel trying to get work done whilst bringing the money in at the same time.  Without proper planning this seldom works with paying guests.

I will not be staying here again.
",2,2018,03,07
248,Rugby trip,"Very friendly staff nice hotel. I went for the rugby with the boys. 
Clean & comfortable with a lovely pool, sauna, Jacuzzi steam room, and fully equipped gym for customers to use. Beautiful full English breakfast, cereals, and they have a continental breakfast.
On the other hand, you can have all three with pots of Tea coffee and fruit juices.
Good size TV in room & free Wi-Fi.
About 18 minutes walk to all the bars.

248,2 nights in dublin,"this hotel in brilliant location. Everything within walking distance. although tram and bus terminals right there if needed. Rooms were very comfortable,  especially the lovely big bed. They were spotlessly clean, hairdryer and iron provided. There was also a lovely swimming pool sauna and steam room. food in bar was good and breakfast was lovely too.",4,2018,03,03
248,Good size rooms but a bit noisy,"Central well priced hotel for business or training courses, maybe not somewhere i’d want to stay on a romantic break but had everything I needed with good size rooms and beds. I was on the first floor, the traffic was very noisy until about 11pm which would have been fine but I’d been up from 4am and would have liked an early night, this kept me awake.
I wouldn’t hold out too much hope for the wellness area, it could do with updating and I’d skip breakfast next time, it was poor",3,2018,03,01
248,Rugby trip excellent stay,"We stayed here for 3 nights and the hotel and staff were lovely. On the last day one of our party had a medical emergency and was taken to hospital. Hotel called ambulance , sorted our luggage as my sister and I had to stay on. Sorted us a room and really looked after us. Special thanks to James. Definitely will return to this hotel. ",5,2018,03,01
248,"Clean, modern, and within walking distance of central Dublin","My family stayed here for two nights while visiting Dublin.  The staff was extremely friendly and helpful, and the rooms were spacious, clean and modernly furnished.  They had underground parking which was convenient as we had driven in from the airport.

We found the hotel was withing 15 minutes walking distance of most places we wanted to visit in Dublin, including 12 minutes from St. Patrick's cathedral where we grabbed a hop-on, hop-off bus, and also 15 from Grafton St. and the Temple Bar district.

The hotel itself had great modern decor with upscale warmth.  We had the breakfast buffet both days and all the classic Irish food was great, including the smoked salmon, Irish bacon and sausage.  Next door was a great old Irish pub called the Bleeding Horse where we were able to pop in for a late night pint at the end of the day.",5,2018,02,25
248,Poor Restaurant Experience,"This is a review of their in house restaurant, the Iveagh, as there doesnt seem to be a separate entry.  I will review the hotel separately.   Before I start I have had good food ere before but today was another matter.  The prices in the restaurant are high but not extortionate, E45 for two course and a drink, but for that I expect excellent service and quality. Started with the beef sesame salad, not great, the beef had been cooked till dry on the edge of unpalatable, but maybe that's what is was supposed to be. managed toeat half of it, my fault for not complaining about it.  For man course I had steak, asked to be rare with sweet potato fries, came with the barest hint of red so I sent it back, second try was better, but I think they just refried the fires to warm them up again as they were oily and soggy, by this time I had lost my appetite and left them.  Service wasn't great either,you expect if you have to send something back and wait while they redo it, they they will offer something, even of just a drink, nothing.   And, ye I know I should have complained about the started and the fries but I expect when I leave a plate over half unfinished I get asked if it was OK, just good service.",1,2018,02,19
248,Very good hotel,"Very nice hotel. Room spacious and very clean. Breakfast and dinner selection at the restaurant of a very good standard. Good selection of tv channels and quick internet. 
Location not in Central Dublin but close enough for a nice walk. Surrounded with many little independent restaurants and bars",5,2018,02,19
248,Fantastic hotel! ,"A fantastic hotel in a great location!

The hotel is in a great location in the city, only a 15 minute walk into Temple Bar with plenty of bars, pubs, shops and restaurants along the way. The airport link bus stop is right outside the hotel and is so convenient, only €7 one way to get there in about 20/25 minutes. The hotel spa and pool is complimentary and is lovely for an afternoon of rejuvenation and relaxation in the busy city. The staff were all welcoming and friendly , and the hotel lobby is going through a refurbishment which will only enhance what the hotel already has. Bedrooms are clean, comfortable and tidy Would highly recommend. ",5,2018,02,18
248,Great hotel 👍🏻,"Myself & my boyfriend stayed here for the weekend. We were coming to Dublin for the Script gig. I have been to Dublin many times & have stayed many places but this is by far the best!!
We arrived in the early hours of a Friday morning after a late Thursday flight over. The doors was locked on arrival but after ringing bell the receptionist will let you in. I really liked this for security reasons. The gentleman on reception takes your name & room number every night when arriving back at the hotel. Check in was no problem at all. 

The room was very nice! Big double bed, tv, shower & bath, desk, chairs, mirrors, hairdryer, towels, iron & wardrobes. Complimentary water for you as well. 
The room was very clean & nicely presented. I was very impressed. There’s an ice machine on the floor as well. 

All the staff were brilliant! All very friendly & very helpful. No problem at printing boarding passes off or answering queries. The reception is having a bit of a refurb at the moment but this didn’t impact us at all. And to be honest there wasn’t much noise or disturbance. Certainly couldn’t hear anything in your room. 

We used the pool area on the first morning. There’s a pool, steam room, sauna & small gym. We had an hour or so down in the pool. We didn’t use the gym, but the pool area was ok. A little dated but nice enough. 

Location wise, it’s near St Stephens green. There are lots of bars, takeaways & a Tesco ect next to the hotel. We had twice went in to the bleeding horse pub next door & had a great time. So I’d recommend that! It’s about a 15-20 min walk from temple bar. There is a tram stop right next to the hotel if you don’t fancy the walk & it cost us between €7-€9 in a taxi from the centre near the river. It may seem a little out but Dublin is a big City, so it’s really not that far away. And less then a 10 minute walk to St Stephens shopping centre & Grafton Street. 

The bus stop is just the over road. There is a bus that goes to the airport from there which is €6 each way/€12 return. Think it was the 757 but not quote me on that ! 

I would 100% stay this hotel again. Thanks for a great stay. ",5,2018,02,13
248,Great stay. Great location,"Good service. Comfortable room. Nice, friendly and attentive service. Great location close to many restaurants. Breakfast staff was especially helpful and the food was nice and hot. Easy to get breakfast and get on your way.",5,2018,02,13
248,Great hotel,"Clean, in good condition, 10 minute walk to St Patricks Cathedral, 20 minutes to the centre. nice pub next door (couldn't hear any noise), didn't use the leisure facilities but would have loved to have done if I had paid any attention before I went. Bus stop for the 757 bus route to the airport outside, about a 30 minute journey. Book breakfast the day before for a cheaper rate. Yes the plug sockets are the same as in England and no there is no time difference : )  I would stay here again and am happy to recommend it to you fine people.",4,2018,02,13
248,"Great hotel, handy location",The hotel and staff are always great. Never been disappointed in my stays. Wouldn’t use a different hotel given the choice. Reception is being refurbished but don’t let that put you off. Food is good quality too,5,2018,02,10
248,Perfect for me,"I researched many hotels before choosing the Camden Court for my 5 days in Dublin. 

Convenience: (1) The Airlink Bus rte 757 was easy to find exiting the airport and the last stop on Charlotte’s Way at Camden is right across the street from the hotel. You can purchase a ticket at the tour booth at the airport or pay cash on board. (2) I walked everywhere from the hotel to Trinity College, National Museum, Grafton St. shopping, O’Connell St., Dublin Castle and even The Guinness Storehouse (though that was quite a hike)

Staff: I can’t say enough about the staff, they are all wonderful from housekeeping and dining staff to Arek at the front desk who always had a smile and was so helpful.

Amenities: 1) The Leisure Centre was huge and certainly much nicer than most. It was lovely to have a sauna, whirlpool and good sized pool with a separate kids pool and the gym was well equipped. 2) The Iveagh Restaurant menu has a good variety, the sole was very tasty and the coffee creme brûlée with pistachio ice cream was heavenly. 3) the lobby cafe had delicious house made scones and their Americano coffee was the best. I think they became a little too addictive.

Room: Newly renovated, spotless, extremely comfy bed and pillows. Safe lock box, tea and espresso. Nice bath lotions & shampoo. Great water pressure and temperature.

Overall: there is absolutely nothing negative about the Camden Court. The room was good value, the hotel and neighbourhood felt safe and I had a terrific stay.",5,2018,02,07
248,Excellent Value Great Staff!,"My husband got myself and our daughter a gift to stay here last weekend. The food in the Bar was really good, I highly recommend it. We were lucky enough to get a last minute appointment in Cloud Nine which was located inside the hotel. The couples massage with Danielle  was divine. We were walking distance to temple bar and Grafton street. Thank you for a magical memorable weekend.",5,2018,02,07
248,Fine,A nice hotel very central to Dublin City. Only 5-10 minutes from Grafton Street.  Very friendly and helpful staff. Breakfast was fine.  Rooms nice and clean. Bring your earplugs though. Very thin walls!! ,4,2018,02,03
248,Fabulous in every way,"Me and my group of friends have just returned from a stay at the Camden court hotel. The staff were amazing. Everyone was so helpful and friendly. They remembered is every morning at breakfast. The breakfast is great value for money. It's a buffet of a full English, cereals, pastries, fruit and yoghurt. As much tea/coffee and hot chocolate as you want as well. The reception ordered us taxis, printed boarding passes for us, brought up extra milk and let me check out an hour late free of charge as my flight wasn't until later. 

The spa is great with a really nice sized pool. My friend had a massage and said it was one of the best she'd ever had.

It's not often you find a hotel where they will bend over backwards for you. No one ever said no. 

We loved it and if we visit Dublin again we will definitely stay here again. ",5,2018,01,29
248,Good location friendly comfortable hotel ,"Stayed here for 3 nights recently,
It is situated in a good area close walking distance in to the city with an approx 20 mins stroll. 

The hotel itself has welcoming efficient staff with basic rooms nice decor, comfortable beds, well equipped  bathroom and soft towels, good facilities such as tv coffee making and iron all in. On the negative the double glazing is useless and allows in the busy traffic noise so it is difficult to sleep and no biscuits provided !! 

The leisure facilities are clean well maintained and warm with a good pool, sauna/steam room and gym. I enjoyed the use of all facilities. 

Parking is adequate if you arrive early and costs £10 per day (in my opinion a rip off and should be included in the rate ) 

The restaurant bar and staff are great with a good quality breakfast in comfortable surroundings. 

Overall a good hotel friendly staff slightly overpriced but much better than most hotels in the city centre. I’ve used before. ",4,2018,01,28
248,The staff deserve a higher rating!,"I stayed here for a few nights on business. It’s a lovely hotel with simple but nice decor. 

The hotel is pricey but the food is good. There are so many food options a very short walk away it was just convenient to use the restaurant. 

My room was clean and tidy but there was a rip in the curtain in my room and the bathroom was a little tired in places. As it was business it didn’t bother me.

The whole stay was fairly average though I loved the pool area and ambience, the changing room area could do with a bit of a clean. It has a sauna steam room and deck chairs which were very relaxing.

The best thing about this hotel are the staff which I would rate much more highly. Incredibly friendly and helpful this hotel has great customer service from the guys outside helping with taxi’s to the reception and restaurant staff.",3,2018,01,26
248,Great weekend,"We had a lovely weekend at the Camden Court Hotel. Spa very nice loved the jacuzzi.
Breakfast very good enjoyed the local cheese and rye bread.
Good location and we liked the pub next door which was very handy.",4,2018,01,25
248,Overnight business trip,"Booked for an overnight business trip. For some reason I couldn't book a rate that was bed and breakfast so had to pay the extra for breakfast in the morning. 
Rooms clean, check in check out hassle free. 
Decent wifi connection. ",4,2018,01,21
248,A night in Dublin,"My wife and I spent an overnight in the Camden Court Hotel in Dublin and found the experience very enjoyable. The young man on the reception desk was very friendly and more than helpful. We were allocated a large room with a king-sized bed which was very comfortable. We had a meal there during the day and another around 9 o'clock that night, both of which were reasonably priced and very tasty. The breakfast the next morning was very satisfying. All in all a very enjoyable stay in a lovely location with a good bus service close by.",4,2018,01,19
248,Highly recommended hotel,"Great hotel, service was excellent, staff very friendly, clean and functional pleasant rooms, not overly large but adequate for our stay.. Location very central to South Dublin. This was a good hotel and good value for money...",5,2018,01,15
248,Spa Experience,"We tried to book the spa facility Cloud Nine Retreat) within the Hotel online the day before we arrived in Dublin. We registered and followed the stages step by step but still did not manage to make a booking. So when we arrived in Dublin we decided to call into the Hotel to make a booking for a Couples Experience which was advertised in their pamphlet at 65 Euros with a range of treatments including a Hot Stone Massage.

The young lady on Hotel Reception was very helpful and directed us down to the Leisure facilities, where on arrival we were greeted by two young ladies who informed us that they could not take any bookings and would have to wait for the Manager/Owner as she was the only one allowed to take bookings. We called back 1/2 hour later still no sign of the Owner, so we left our mobile No. and off we went. About 2 hours later we received a call and made our booking, although we were told it would cost us an extra 20 Euros!!

The next day we went for our treatments, on arrival i asked the lady on the desk why we had to pay extra even though her pamphlet did not identify a supplement for Hot Stone Massage. She said it was a mistake and that she was not the owner and we would have to pay the extra. Funny that as she was the one who took our booking!! 

Anyway we said we would pay the extra and went in for our treatments which were very nice and the two young ladies were very attentive and professional. My wife went to pay afterwards with my Debit Card and had a few PIN problems, so paid by cash, at this point the Owner/Manager said she could pay the original price of 65 Euros!!

The Manager of the leisure centre which was run by the Hotel had heard most of our experience and offered us free entry into the pool and other facilities which were excellent.

 Many thanks to the Hotel staff who were all very professional !!!!!",4,2018,01,14
248,New Momma’s Club,My mum lives local so I brought her to the Iveagh restaurant for lunch recently. We made it a regular occurrence and now there’s a group of 8 of us girls that have formed a little lunch club. George on Reception is so nice and always cheers us up. We decided to take advantage of the spa and the pool. The staff at Cloud Nine were so warm and welcoming I highly recommend it. The Bar food is also really good. Thank you.,5,2018,01,10
248,City centre location,Great if you want to stay close to the city. Small but nice room. Expensive because of its location. 5 minutes walk to the end of Grafton Street & St Stephen's Green. Didn't eat there as breakfast wasn't included.,3,2018,01,10
248,Extra nice,Beautiful place with a great staff. The staff was helpful and accommodating. The room was immaculate. The bed and room were both very comfortable. The location is  a little far from most of the town is the only drawback.,4,2018,01,09
248,Highly recommended. ,Staff here were knowledgeable efficient helpful and just plain nice. My wife was ill with flu just before so we rang to cancel.  Eventually we did go and the staff sorted it  for us without any fuss. Room and breakfast were up to expectations. We will happily stay there again.,5,2018,01,07
248,"Great Value, great location","I have been visiting the Camden Court for over 15 years and am consistently impressed by the level of service, sensible pricing, cleanliness and quality of food. Location is excellent for the central Dublin business and retail areas. St Stephens Green is just a 5-7 minute walk, and the tram stops literally just outside the door (Handy for trips to Dundrum). Taxis from Temple Bar area or O'Connell street cost under 10 Euros. The local area is quiet if a little run down, walking on the streets around the hotel is safe and hassle free.

Over the years I have stayed in a variety of rooms, and in some the decor and furnishings can be a tad old fashioned. Last trip I was on the 4th floor and it looked to be relatively recently done up.

Large foyer with plenty of seating ideal for client meetings or people watching!

Iveagh restaurant do an excellent breakfast, one of the best in Dublin in fact, but the evening menu is limited and a little expensive.

The Camden seems to attract an older / family clientele rather than the loud party goers, making it VERY appealing to me!

Car parking in the hotels own car park is very restricted (around 20 spaces) but a large undercover public car park is next door.

Reception staff are very helpful and polite, and KNOW THEIR CITY which is a rare thing in many hotels!",5,2018,01,03
248,Good central location,"Handy to St. Stephens Green, and the Luas. The hotel is on a busy street so get an inner room, but the staff are very good and facilities are good. Walkable to Temple Bar and plenty of pubs close by. There is lots of choice",4,2018,01,03
248,Wipe your feet on the way out,"From the outside CCH is a rather nice building and the parking is great value however the place is so painfully overdue a makeover that is has become a shabby grubby nightmare. The carpets in the lobby and the breakfast area are worn out as is my patience after staying there. The carpets in the rooms are no better. In our room (302) the handle is coming off the wardrobe, the soap holder is coming loose from the wall and the decor is just dated. The noise all through the night either of the hot water or heating system actually woke me up and I had to try and get back to sleep using foam ear plugs. Very little sleep. The leisure facilities are also work out, grout is missing between tiles, the pant is different shades on the ceiling, the roof tile holders are rusting and there is black all around along the tiles where they haven't been cleaned at the top end of the pool at the water line. Throughout the hotel there is a clear absence of proper cleaning or maintenance. Breakfast was also a poor experience, the chef was out the front of house fixing the food display in causal clothing and grubby trainers, the woman serving the hot breakfast was in a grumpy mood, the serving tray holders area on the front was empty and fifty, even the coffee machine was dirty and needed cleaned. 

This hotel could be one of Dublins finest but it will need a major overhaul. At present is it very poor and should be avoided at all costs. We chose this hotel because of the leisure facilities and because we wanted a relaxing break, a rest bite. We ended up in a tired, grubby hotel with very little sleep, so glad we only had to endure one night. Wipe your feet on the way out.",1,2018,01,02
248,Excellent stay,"Stayed in Camden court there two nights after Christmas. There's good parking underneath, only €10 a day which is brilliant for Dublin. 
From the moment we arrived till the moment we left the staff were very friendly and couldn't do enough for us. 

Food and drink was good. Food was a bit on the expensive side but that's Dublin and we don't mind paying a bit extra when it's as good as it was here.
Rooms were perfect, very clean, great beds and had a good shower. They had water in the room for us and a coffee machine. Really really good. A lot of nice touches. 

Reception also had water and water flavoured with lemon for all the guests.  
I've stayed in Dublin for years with mates for breaks away. The Camden court is definitely the best place I've stayed.
Excellent. ",5,2018,01,01
248,"Good location, good facilities, but room was a bit tired ","Overall we enjoyed our stay here. The hotel is an easy walking distance from the city centre, about a 5 minute walk from St Stephen's Green. There are lots of nice pubs and restaurants nearby. The facilities in the hotel are very good, easy parking, the pool and sauna are very nice. The atmosphere in the hotel and lobby was very nice and the food in the bistro bar was very good.
However, we found our room (and more so the corridor) on the third floor to be quite tired, not awful, but definitely not to the standard expected of a 4 star hotel. Beds were comfortable though and plenty of clean towels and toiletries. ",4,2017,12,24
248,Visiting Dublin with friends,"The hotel was booked by our usual travel agency so we had high expetations. On aarival we were met by really friendly front desk staff.
The rooms are clean. very nice, good space and ver funcual.
Breakfast is right on the top.
Friendly nice bar.
Restaurant can be recomended.  Great stay",5,2017,12,22
248,functional and central,"Friendly staff and rooms that are clean and functional.  There is also parking which is unusual in the city centre.  The hotel is walking distance from most of the city centre attractions.  Even though it was central, I found the hotel was very quiet.",5,2017,12,12
248,"Welcoming, warm, friendly, perfect location for a stay in Dublin !!","My husband and I stayed at the Camden Court Hotel recently for a one nights stay, we found the staff to be so friendly and welcoming in every aspect of the hotel, from the Reception, to Car Park Attendents, to Staff in the Restaurant at Breakfast !!  Location is ideal for walking to Stephens Green, Grafton Street,...   it will be our ' go to'  hotel now when visiting Dublin for sure !!",5,2017,12,11
248,A little comfortable place in Dublin,"What a warm atmosphere! The hall is magic, the rooms are nice.
Breakfasts are quite good. May be I would add more fruits and vegetables. I would go back to this hotel with pleasure. Thank you for everything!",4,2017,12,06
248,PRIME LOCATION TO EXPLORE DUBLIN ON FOOT,"I stayed 7 nights in this hotel.  It was clean, modern and comfortable with first class facilities and within waling distance of all major sights of Dublin City. Servicing the room was perhaps a tad slow on some days, but staff in general were friendly and eager to please. First class buffet breakfast. I particularly enjoyed the freshly fried eggs and freshly carved bacon loin served by hard-working motherly employee who clearly wished to see her visitors well fed.  Good value conference facilities.",4,2017,11,28
248,"Lovely hotel, great leisure facilities, avoid spa","My husband, my parents and I were in Dublin in November for my graduation from my masters. Hotel prices in the city seemed crazy and there wasn't much available. I'd never heard of the Camden court hotel but it was reasonably price and had a pool which my dad likes so I booked. We weren't sure what to expect but were pleasantly surprised - big hotel, fairly modern, good size rooms, big bed, good shower/bath and Orla Kiely products in the bathroom was a nice touch. The location was ideal for us on the busy camden street with lots of good bars/pubs and a 10min walk down the the university one way and 10min to grafton street the other way. We had a minor issue with housekeeping letting themselves into our room twice on Sunday morning whilst we were in bed - apparently a glitch with the system. This did mean we were up to use the leisure facilities. Good size pool, sauna and steam room - the changing rooms were a bit dated but we went back up to our room to get ready. Our main area of issue with the hotel was the Cloud Nine spa - my mum and I went for luxury manicures which were 50min treatments (€60) each whilst the men went whisky tasting. We had to have back to back appointments as they only have one nail room. They set us up with a spare chair so could chat and got us a cup of tea which was nice. The girl got started on mums manicure and did a very good job although this in itself took the 50mins. Then the manager came in to do the shellac polish as the girl wasn't qualified - at this point she started filling and buffing the nails again. By the time she was applying the last layer of shellac it had taken nearly 1h30 so she said she didn't have time to do the full works for myself but would do a file and shellac paint for half price €30 so I agreed. My mums nails were a very messy paint and due to an issue with the lamp took forever to dry. Mine was a rushed job where the manager actually sliced open my finger. Looking back I'm not sure why we paid €90 in total for a shambles of a job. We would have been better in the walk in places down the street.
Lovely hotel, lovely facilities who shouldn't be affiliated with the spa.",4,2017,11,26
248,Social function at Camden Court Hotel - November 2017,"About 40 colleagues gathered for a social get-together in one of the hotel's fine function rooms, which included an audio-visual presentation using the hotel's facilities, and with refreshments (tea/coffee biscuits).   The room was very comfortable for us all, and the AV equipment worked like a dream.  The Meetings Manager and support staff were very attentive and efficient, both during the booking phase and on the evening itself. The evening was a great success.  I highly recommend the Camden Court for meetings and functions.",5,2017,11,21
248,Donna S.,This hotel is very clean and in an excellent location. We walked all over Dublin from our hotel as we were on a tour bus and did not have a car. We stayed here 3 nights and enjoyed all of our meals in the restaurant. The breakfasts were excellent and had a lot of choices. The pastries were very good.,5,2017,11,18
248,Great stay great location ,"The location of this hotel is brilliant. The lobby area is a great size with loads of seating. The room was a  nice and warm , but the view out the window wasn’t the best . Would definitely stay here again",4,2017,11,15
248,recent 3 day stay in Dublin,"Spent 3 days 2 nights at the Camden. First visit to Dublin. The hotel was located in a nice section of the city. Walking distance to restaurants, shopping,  city tours etc. The hotel rooms were nice sized, comfortable beds,  adequate bathroom size, room safe, clean and neat, quiet location, nice breakfast buffet.  There is a bar attached to the front of the hotel that I don;t think is owned by the hotel.  The hotel staff was always friendly and helpful. We had left our iphone charger at the last stop and they took our phones and charges them at the desk. We took advantage of the gym each day. It is staffed full time and is quite adequate  although the equipment is somewhat dated. There is also a swimming pool, steam room and sauna attached to the gym.

There is coffer makers in the rooms but no USB outlets available so bring your own chargers. Good WIFI.",4,2017,11,10

248,Pleasant hotel,"Second visit. Nice stay. Good breakfast, clean rooms, good bar. A little bit of a walk to the Liffey, maybe 10 minutes, so ok if not raining.  Really, the only thing you can say negative is that it’s a little bit of a walk down Harcourt St to get just to St Steven’s Green. The LUAS is only a block away, so a Leap Card would solve that. ",4,2017,11,05
248,Terrible Spa,"My experience at Cloud Nine Wellness & Beauty was the worst spa treatment I have ever experienced. Throughout my massage, the therapist was on her phone for the majority of the time. I felt it was not my place to highlight this as I had to endure an hour of the treatment. When I raised this with the manager he apologised and offered me a discount on another treatment. Spa treatments are not cheap and there was no way I was going to spend anymore money there. The manager didn't even bother to reply to me. If you want a relaxing, stress reducing treatment don't go here. It just winds you up more.",1,2017,11,04
248,Weekend break,Overall we didn't think much of our stay here. Check in was ok..room clean but  basic for a 4*. At breakfast the  Man serving was rude and the cooked food wasn't nice. The location was great though. And car parking under hotel very handy.,3,2017,11,03

248,Great Hotel & Staff,"had the pleasure to staff at the Camden Court on a whistle stop visit to the fair city. I have to say that i enjoyed the experience of staying in this particular hotel from the moment I walked in. The staff at the hotel are very pleasant, well mannered and professional nothing is too much trouble. Situated in a great location in the city it is a brief walk to many of the local sites and sounds. Great pubs and restaurants in the area as well, whats not to like. The room was extremely comfortable and modern, great breakfast as well. Would definitely recommend this hotel if you are visiting. I will certainly be returning next time.",5,2017,10,30
248,"Great location, shame about the room....","Having stayed here on two previous occasions on , I booked this hotel again without hesitation... We love this hotel and all it offers... Great location and friendly efficient staff...
However on this occasion I was very disappointed with our room.. Too small for two people... We had an early start the next morning so decided to get room service but soon realised there was actually nowhere in the room to eat it... No table and one chair.. I hadn't come away to eat my dinner off my knee.. 
Luckily the bar downstairs was still serving food.. The food was nice and well presented. The bar staff friendly and welcoming.
Breakfast good the next morning..
This is a really busy hotel but well managed..
I would stay again but would like a larger room next time...

248,"Comfortable, friendly and central","This was the first hotel our group stayed at on our tour and it left a great first impression. The hotel itself is in a central location with easy access to several points of interest as well as local pubs, although the restaurant also has a restaurant and bar onsite. It also has a pool and exercise area that supplies towels and friendly staff throughout. Our room had two twin beds which were relatively comfortable. This hotel has facecloths as well as bath towels and higher end Orla Kiely toiletries, including shampoo and conditioner. It also has an in-room safe, kettle and both carbonated and non-carbonated water in room. Although our view from the room was not all that scenic, we did not experience any problems with noise.  Dinner as well as the breakfast buffet were both good and the assigned seating times allowed the various groups to sit together, but not overwhelm the restaurant or the staff, although there was a bit of a lineup at the breakfast buffet occasionally, but it moved well.",5,2017,10,25

248,September 2017 Group Tour - Great time in Dubin,"I brought a group of 46 to Ireland in September 2017. We stayed at the Camden Court. Rooms were lovely, staff pleasant and food excellent. Breakfast can be hectic as other groups staying at the hotel may be having breakfast at the same time. As a result, you may not be able to sit with your group and lines at the buffet  may be long. You may have to wait a while for tea/coffee. Valerie - group manager - is an absolute delight and fantastic to work with. Location is good. I highly recommend this hotel.",5,2017,10,14

Then she was placed in the hands of Kerri Ann (and what wonderful hands they were) who pauline had nothing but good things to say about the treatment she received.

Good place to park yourself while in Dublin.",4,2017,10,10
248,"Great location, great hotel","We really enjoyed our stay in the Camden Court. We were just looking for a place to sleep as we were going to see a match in the Aviva and meeting friends afterwards so it was a quick stop but we were so impressed and sad that we did not get to spend more time in the hotel.

Location & parking: We are from Wexford and I hate driving in Dublin city, I knew this was very central too, (approx. five minute walk from Stephens Green) so I was very nervous driving to it, but was very happy at how easy it to get to and out of and the parking is located underground of the hotel for €10 a day, very reasonable for central Dublin. It was approx. 40 minutes walk to the Aviva which was fine for us, later that night after going out along the popular nightlife street including Copper Face Jacks (aka Coppers) and Whelans it was only less than 5 minutes to walk back to the hotel.

Room: I was so pleasantly surprised with the room. This was one of the few remaining hotels for the night of the match and was a reasonable price, so we weren't expecting much. The beds were so comfy and big. Looks very modern and kept very clean. Really loved the extra touch of the Orla Kiely products in the bathroom as I know that is a more expensive brand, not your average hotel bathroom products!

Leisure Centre: I only discovered at the last minute there was a leisure centre and threw in swim wear just in case. Again, being in Dublin City Centre, I didn't expect much from this. Both of us where overwhelmed when we went in. Changing rooms could do with an update but the sauna was really hot, which I love, steam room was perfect too, plenty of steam, and the jacuzzi was huge and really warm with some strong jets, sadly only dipped my toe in the pool but it was very quiet when we were there at 10am on a Saturday morning. I even commented to the lady working there it was like a small scale spa! Only other suggestion would be a drinking water machine would be great, as we forgot to buy some water and didn't want to go back to reception to get some so we left early as we were so thirsty, just bring water!! Towels were provided and no swim hats required. Lady on reception was lovely and friendly.

Overall: We are already planning another trip and plan to spend more time in the hotel hopefully. Along with everything all the staff we encountered were great and couldn't do enough for you. Highly recommend for anyone who wants to stay quieter central Dublin. Look forward to staying again!",5,2017,10,10
248,"Not awful, but below standard I expected","This hotel didn't have air-conditioning, the with the windows open it was noisy and the fan provided was no use since there are no accessible plug in sockets. It made for two hit, sweaty nights in a bad way. It also lacked a refrigerator to store medicines in.  All was not bad, the provided meals were very good, sometimes excellent. The location was probably as good as  can be had at a reasonable price.  Don't come here expecting much -- Hampton Inns in the states are better -- and you won't be disappointed.",3,2017,10,07
248,Very pleasant stay,"First of all, rooms in Dublin are ridiculously expensive.  So trying to find one that is decent and close enough to the sights without breaking the bank is a task.  I thought the price was high, but compared to others I think that we did ok.  We were able to walk to the temple bar area in about 15 minutes.  It was a nice day and there's a lot to see on the way there and back, so it was nice.  The room was clean and had all of the amenities.  I have heard that noise at night can be a problem in some Dublin hotels, but this one was very quiet.  The staff was very helpful.  We skipped the breakfast due to the expense, but there are plenty of good restaurants close by.  Overall, I would definitely stay here again.",4,2017,10,06
248,Great Value,"This hotel turned out to be a pleasant surprise.  We were awarded it on Hotwire and had low expectations after reading the reviews. This hotel is a very respectable 4 star hotel that appears to have been renovated in the last few years. 

We were checked in by a chatty clerk who gave us a quiet room overlooking a parking lot and straight into the office building on the other side of it.  The room itself was a decent size, well decorated with a comfortable bed and the dreaded shower/tub combo. 

The hotel is in a wonderful location with many pubs and stores within walking distance.  The Airlink express bus from the airport stops on one side of the hotel and the Luas station is on the other side. Traveling to/from the airport and Stephens Green was a piece of cake.

We ate several meals at the hotel over the several days we were there and was never disappointed.  Room service was fast, reasonably priced and tasty.  The breakfast buffet was well laid out with the foods being kept at their proper temperature.  The restaurant and bar waitstaff was a little hit or miss, but they never adversely affected any of our meals.  

All things considered this was a great hotel and we would definitely there again.",4,2017,10,05
248,Not very friendly,"This was a weekend trip with my wife, after a walk outside came in to the hotel lobby. I took a seat and someone from management told me to move as he wanted someone else to sit where I was sitting. I was told to go to the bar and sit down, not even sure if the other people were residents.
Breakfast is a bit of hit and a miss,when asking,  when we would get our tea / coffee, eventually the tea came or rather was flung down at us, we had similar issues at the bar. This hotel seems to cater for large bus parties to the detriment of individual guests.
The best thing about the hotel is the swimming pool, and the location.",3,2017,10,03
248,"great hotel, great location",The Camden Court is a wonderfully appointed hotel close to great pubs and restaurants and within walking distance to many major attractions and parks. The interior courtyard can be little noisy with patrons coming and going but quiet with the windows shut. Staff were attentive and the inclusive breakfast buffet was excellent.,5,2017,10,03
248,Sports massage,"Ahead of a run im doing I got a fantastic sports massage in the Cloud Nine spa. I've had a good few massages and this was one of the best, a 'proper' sports massage. Highly recommended and not just for runners, anybody just trying to get rid of niggles and improve flexibility. ",5,2017,09,29
248,Another lovely stay. ,"We booked four rooms here for a family stay in August. 

Check in was friendly, efficient and hassle-free. 

Our rooms were available for immediate occupancy and were immaculate, spacious and bright. The rooms do have a 'corporate' feel about them, however they have everything in them one could need (tea and coffee facilities, iron and ironing board, hairdryer etc.) 

We return to this hotel when visiting Dublin as its staff are unfailingly helpful and polite, its facilities are excellent and the location is so very convenient for exploring the city. 

Breakfast is buffet style, both hot and cold. The quality of the Irish sausages and bacon is always excellent and there is a fabulous range of food to choose from. The evening meals in the restaurant really are excellent. The food in the bar is also very, very good and the service and atmosphere are fabulous. 

The leisure facilities are superb and we always make great use of them on a wet, miserable Irish day. 

The Camden Court offers excellent value for money and we will have no hesitation in staying the next time we are in Dublin. 

",5,2017,09,22
248,Nice clean hotel,"Hotel is near shoppingstreets, easy to walk from, cosy rooms, polite staff, swimmingpool, saunas, hottub, gym. Some rooms have bathtub.
Breakfast was good, two elevators, conferencerooms had just what was supposed.",5,2017,09,22
248,Cozy & friendly ,"Rooms are cozy and comfortable. The Friday night street noise was a little bothersome but I did realize the city was celebrating Octoberfest so it was not a big deal. The best feature of this hotel is the staff- knowledgeable, courteous and friendly. They really made my stay stress free",4,2017,09,18
248,ireland Visit,"The last part of our Irish Tour we stayed at the Camden Court Hotel. We hd a great time. The hotel is central to many things and is located on a bus line where you can travel to many places in Dublin. Pat and Roy helped our group tremendously. The food was great, and the rooms were very nice.",5,2017,09,18
248,An overpriced loud business hotel - but with great service and good location,"Location is good, staff is good, swimming pool, sauna and steam bath are great. Pillows are nice. We borrowed umbrella and adaptor, wifi is good too. A normal basic business type hotel but way too expensive for what it provides.

The cost of the room per night does not make justice to the type of accomodation. Maybe it was the holiday inflating the price? Maybe those are the normal prices in Dublin? 
We asked for a quiet room and the first night it was not possible. The first option was room on the second floor over the main road and the other option was 601, high but in front of the elevator doors and worse with the main ventilation machine outside humming loudly the whole night. 
Staff was great in making the effort to change us, but that first night we did not sleep. Then we were in a quiet room but the bed was in fact two single beds put together which was not really confortable. Paying almost 200€ a night for bad nights of sleep sucks... The swimming pool and sauna closes too early - 20:30 on a weekend. 
Service is great, they are doing their best, but please lower the cost.",3,2017,09,17
248,Rooms are hard to come by in Dublin,"I traveled with a group tour of Ireland and we spent two days here. I needed the handicapped room because of a recent bicycle accident. The room was quite adequate. However, the shower/bathing facilities were not suitable. Water filled the entire floor of the bathroom and then I had to use towels to absorb the excess water. It was a serious tripping hazard. The staff was courteous and I would actually stay here again.",3,2017,09,09
248,Another Stay!,"I have stayed here before whilst on business and also recommended it to several colleagues. I'ts a good value hotel in a nice area with great facilities. Only a minute away from a good choice of bars, places to eat and the tram. Beds are nice and comfy and the rooms are a good size. Will be using again and continuing to recommend.",4,2017,09,08
248,Cloud Nine Massage treatment - Professional trained staff incl. physio and sport therapist,"Martin runs a very professional business and his staff are well trained. We have had several massage treatments with Martin and Melissa and give high praise to both for excellent experiences. Martin a whizz at locating any problem areas and sorting them, he is a qualified physiotherapist. Good luck with second new location at Grand Canal",5,2017,09,07
248,Experienced noise ,"Stayed in room 312 for 3 nights from 21st August. Initially chose this hotel purely due to the gym and spa which both lived up to expectations.

Being a regular business traveller spending a week a month in Dublin I feel the Camden Court is what I've been looking for. Nice friendly staff, excellent facilities and nice food. The 15-20 minute walk to the office by temple bar is fine.

Unfortunately, I have had to down grade the hotel purely because of the noise experienced in room 312. Paying nearly £200 per night I would expect an undisturbed sleep. Unfortunately, 2 out of the 3 nights were disturbed and broken sleep due to deliveries to the hotel that appeared to be outside reception in the early hours of the morning. Not only this, the room walls appear paper thin so if the guest next door has a habit of snoring then this also will keep you up.

That said, if the hotel can assure me that there are quieter parts of the hotel which has less noise then I would be happy to book again mainly because of the gym and sauna. 

I also had an issue with the iron in the room squirting out some orange liquid form. The hotel dry cleaner this free of charge of course.

I'd be grateful if, reading this, the hotel would contact me to discuss the noise issue before I book a 5 night stay in 3 weeks time.

Thanks",3,2017,09,07
248,Welcome to Ireland,"Awesome Hotel to begin our Ireland 14 day Vacation (Holiday), room was spacious and very nice.  Staff was super attentive, Food and drinks were excellent.  We stayed here 3 nights and enjoyed every minute.  Bar in hotel provided live entertainment during the weekend. Right next door we had an awesome Pub called “The Black Horse” Good drinks and food. We had a Fantastic experience.",5,2017,09,06
248,Long weekend beak- 3rd - 5th September,"3rd - 5th September 2017 - Arrived early AM and the room was available, which is always a good start to the break. The staff were very helpful and polite, the room was clean and the location of the hotel was excellent for site seeing and the airport bus stopped right outside. The only minor point was that the rooms do not have air conditioning and it was particularly warm at night with only a fan to circulate the air.; Overall a good stay.",4,2017,09,06
248,Good hotel in a good location,"Very good hotel right in the middle of town.
Check in was very quick and efficient and the staff were very friendly and helpful. Nice bed rooms complete with a good coffee machine.
Breakfast was very good. 
Recommended",4,2017,09,06
248,Good stay,The Camden Court Hotel is well located - easy walking distance to Stephen's Green and city centre and right next to Luas Tram stop if you need to go further afield. Rooms are very comfortable and breakfast is of a very high standard with a great array of choice. Full Irish with other options. It's right next door to the Bleeding Horse Pub which also serves excellent pub food. The fish n Chips were delicious and fresh. The hotel has a pool and Spa which was a nice surprise for a city center Hotel which is great for kids (and my wife who sed the Spa) but the downside is you get a faint smell of chlorine when you're checking in. Not sure if that can be helped. Anyways staff are great - extremely helpful and everyone we came across went out of their way to make us feel extremely welcome. Special mention to guy helping with baggage and lady serving up breakfast.,4,2017,09,05
248,Good location out of the tourist hubbub,"Our group of four couples stayed here for three nights.  Our travel agent in the States booked us (as she's booked many other clients over the years).

Not in the main tourist area, but within 20 minutes walking distance.  Lots of bars and restaurants nearby.  Very close to St. Stephen's Green.

Very good service.  Comfortable room.  Extensive breakfast buffet.

Recommended.",4,2017,08,30
248,Superb Hotel,"We were a hen party of 5 over the weekend, we arrived Saturday and left on the Monday.  Staff were helpful on arrival and throughout our visit helping us with booking taxi's and informing us good places to visit as this was our first time in Dublin.  We had two rooms booked and both rooms were lovely and clean, it had everything we needed, toiletries, iron, hair dryers, items you wouldn't expect.  We really enjoyed our visit and would definitely recommend this hotel and would definitely book this hotel again as we are planning on returning to Dublin.",5,2017,08,30
248,A visit to Cloud Nine Retreat,"I really enjoyed my visit for the pamper package.  Sarah looked after me and was excellent for both the massage and facial.  I was made to feel very welcome by the team, and left feeling relaxed and very comfortable.",4,2017,08,29
248,We couldn't fault it,As part of our trip around Ireland we spend are last few days in Dublin. We chose this hotel as it was walking distance to the city centre and was on a bus route to the centre if required. Older or less mobile people should consider this as it's over a km walk to the centre. The room was large and the bed comfortable. The bath was over the shower and the pool are looked good. We would have like to use the facilities but ran out of time.,5,2017,08,26
248,Irish Surprise,"Camden Court Hotel is an excellent location which is  close to most things including St. Stephen's Square, shopping on Grafton St and Trinity College.  It is also located across the street from  the Airlink express bus 757 to the airport.  Wonderful pool and spa area. The staff were very professional and friendly.  The only thing that it lack was a ceiling fan in the room.  The rooms are not air conditioned and it was a little muggy in the room.  Besides that it was a good place to stay for the money.  If we return to Dublin we would definitely stay here again.",3,2017,08,23
248,You can smell the pool!,"Stayed here twice this week on business as we have an office just 10 minutes away. The archway to the entrance of the hotel is quite pretty but possibly could be easily missed. The receptionists were very helpful and quick. Free water is out in the reception area. Only negative is that the strong smell of chlorine from the swimming pool is everywhere and you can smell it as soon as you walk in. 
My room was on the 5th floor on the end. It had a weird shape as it was a corner room but that wasn't really a problem. There was only one plug socket in the whole room that I could find and that was next to the bed. Ideally for charging the phone but not for doing my hair in the morning!
The breakfast in the morning was very good and had variety. The staff serving were friendly too, just be careful of the hot plates! ",3,2017,08,23
248,Great city hotel with friendly staff and great rooms,"We stayed in suites on the 5th floor. The suites are amazing, super spacious, very clean with a great feel to them. The staff are so helpfull and great to deal with and very  friendly. The breakfast is great, there is a husge selection and extremly nice. Highly recommended this hotel for a city break.",5,2017,08,23
248,Great breakfast and food,"The room is average and the service is same . Its conveniently located and you can walk to business meetings . The breakfast is great and an experience in itself . Its typical Irish with baked bean and thick bacon and bread , enough for a day's meal .  The room is clean and everything works .  For business and pleasure you wont be disappointed .",4,2017,08,23
248,Mixed Review,"Location is great, especially if you're driving with reasonable parking prices. Spa area lovely with great staff checking us in and out who were really friendly and made us feel really welcome! 

Breakfast - DO NOT EAT HERE, BAD FOOD, RUDE STAFF - the breakfast is overpriced at 17euro per person with sub standard fry up and rude staff. To explain, there was a big group of us at the hotel therefore for breakfast we decided to all go separately, my partner and I were the first to breakfast, another member of our party wanted to simply come into the dining area to see if the breakfast was good and let us know what they were doing. She was greeted by a staff member who was less than friendly who then followed her part way to the table and then proceeded to 'keep watch' to ensure that she did not eat anything (paying 170euro for the room you'd think it was included anyway!) We then witnessed an exchange between her and the supervisor who then both 'kept watch' making for a very uncomfortable experience for all of us involved, meaning not only did we have a bad breakfast but were also not trusted to not steal from the hotel! 

Further to this others in our party went out for breakfast (having heard our reviews of the hotel one) they used one of the tables in the lobby to meet, having the rest of their take away coffee whilst they waited for everyone to check out, one member of the group was eating as they had not had time to have a sit down breakfast to which a member of staff approached and quite rudely stated 'You cannot bring outside food into the hotel' which, ok... understandable.... we get it...but.... there is a way of approaching people without being rude, considering the circumstance they didn't have much of a choice but to eat on the run and then waiting. 

Overall it was an average stay, however; for the price of the hotel breakfast should be included and some of the staff should be re-trained in customer service (this was only 2 members  of staff, the rest of the staff we encountered were really friendly and a real credit to the hotel, but it only takes one negative encounter to ruin a perfectly good stay)",3,2017,08,21
248,Dublin Ireland Lodgings,"We choose to stay an extra night in Dublin at the end of a tour of the country.  The Camden was chosen because of location and price.  It was a good choice.  Most sights, we were interested in, were an easy walk from our hotel.  The staff was accommodating and our room was very clean and comfortable.  They were late preparing our room so the manager invited us to have a free drink in their pub while we were waiting.  It wasn't a huge offer but it was more than appropriate and done for the right reasons.  If visiting Dublin again, I would definitely consider staying the Camden again.",4,2017,08,18
248,Excellent for a city break,"We were on a city break to Dublin and we are very pleased to have picked Camden Court to stay at. The hotel has an excellent location and you can get everywhere pretty fast on foot. The room was immaculately clean. We particularly liked having coffee at the lobby, it's pretty cozy and elegant.",5,2017,08,18
248,Hen Do Stay,"15 of us arrived here to stay for the weekend to celebrate my hen do. Lovely hotel, rooms are of a good standard, our triple room perhaps just a little small for all our bags and 3 of us all at once.

We had room service breakfast which arrived for the time ordered and was really nice. Perhaps a little expensive but a perfect hangover cure.

The hotel is situated in a really good area of the city and each local person we spoke to reconfirmed this. Next door to the hotel is a really good lively pub, it doesn't effect the hotel in anyway but its really handy being near such a fabulous pub to then fall into the hotel late on.

We spent late nights at the hotel bar which was really nice and the bar staff were really welcoming and friendly. A special mention to Declan, fabulous service with a gorgeous smile.

I would definitely revisit this hotel and bar next time we visit Dublin. ",4,2017,08,14
248,Couples weekend away ,"I stayed here in recently and found it to be a gem of a hotel outside the city centre (10 taxi ride into the city)with a lovely old fashioned pub the bleeding Horse adjacent. The room was small but the bed was very comfortable our room was at the back so no road noise which meant a great nights sleep. There was also a swimming pool ,sauna and jacuzzi available for use included in the rooms reasonable price. The breakfast was average good choice of continental and hot breakfast however a lot of young staff who looked as though it was their first job and who were not impressed at having to get up early on a Sunday morning  i.e unprofessional. Lastly the underground parking was validated by the hotel at 10 Euro per night and when we asked if we could leave the car for an extra couple of hours it was no problem which meant we didn't have to look for parking in the city. Overall a great stay and would recommend to others.",4,2017,08,13
248,Very good ,"Everything is great - location, bedrooms, bar, restaurant. One of the better hotels I've stayed in, wouldn't consider another in Dublin other than the Camden court!  

Stayed lots of times here, perfect each time ",5,2017,08,12
248,Great location and hotel,"First time at the Camden work meetings using the hotels facilities no problem, room and service all great, will be back, there us a great Indian very close but you must book. The service and dar at the hotel great and staff very professional, breakfast was great and well served.",5,2017,08,08
248,Excellent family city hotel,"Was very pleasantly surprised at how welcome the children were made in a city hotel . From hot chocolate to kids cocktails 🍹 with dinner , very accommodating. Excellent . Pool v clean , family room had play station and box of boys and only problem was my boys didn't want leave the room then 😀. Very happy campers. Great location within walking distance to grafton street . Surrounded by Fantastic restaurants and bars too. Well done Camden Court and staff 👌",5,2017,08,07
248,"Very good, but bring ear plugs/white noise","Beautiful hotel - location, room size, amenities and restaurant - all excellent.  Agree with other reviewer about the night noise though, especially if you are there in the summer and need your windows open to keep it cool.  Staff was very nice and we would stay there again.",4,2017,08,05
248,Lovely Hotel,"Just back from Camden Court Hotel Dublin.
Ideal for the 757 bus from the airport, hotel staff very helpful, bedroom very clean. Excellent full breakfast, plenty choice. Only a 5 minute walk to Graften Street. ",5,2017,08,04
248,Unacceptable late night noise,"Sorry but this hotel was not good. Stayed in room 533 which faces over the internal courtyard where taxis/coaches park to access the hotel. No air con, so window needed to be left open to keep room reasonable temperature. Woken at 3am by delivery lorry which was noisily loaded. This isn't street noise this was directly outside the hotel and appeared to be taking/bring stuff from the hotel. Reception told me this was a quiet room when I checked in, sorry but they were having a laugh.",2,2017,08,04
248,Accommodation ,Very well located hotel. Room was comfortable with nice flat screen tv that was very good. A bit of noise from the street because hotel is downtown. The windows in room open and fresh air was a bonus! The beds were very comfortable. Two restaurants that were fine. The Bleeding Horse pub is adjacent to hotel and many other restaurant in walking distance. Grafton street shopping area and St. Stephens Green as well as the Dublin Museum of natural history were close walking distance. We would stay at the hotel again when back in Dublin.,4,2017,08,03
248,Good hotel in convenient location,"We stayed three nights at Camden Court so got a good idea of what the hotel is like. The customer service was good, the rooms quite large and well equipped, and breakfast was outstanding. The hotel has an indoor pool and well equipped gym. There isn't much more you could want in a hotel.

The hotel is also well located with easy access to the main attractions. It is outside the Temple Bar zone, so it's relatively quiet, but not too far as to make the walk to see everything too great. It is also surrounded by many bars and restaurants.

We thought overall it was good value for money.",4,2017,08,03
248,Run down location,"Nice enough hotel with boarded up buildings right across the street.  Other than The Bleeding Horse pub next door, which stops serving food at 9:30pm, dining options are very limited.  Walk to downtown Dublin is 15-20 minutes, and I did not feel safe walking at night.  Most of the staff is friendly, but one person at the front desk was consistently rude during my 5 day stay.   I'd much rather spend more and stay at the Westin or another upscale hotel that is centrally located with good local dining options.",3,2017,07,31
248,Camden Court,"We were not in our rooms much, and they were fine. A little cramped and no air conditioning but probably not a problem normally since it was much warmer than usual when we were there. Pretty noisy with Windows open at night. Location is great and offers many walkable restaurants. Staff was polite and the breakfast buffet was very good.",4,2017,07,30
248,"Regular Dublin hotel for me but this time, hot and bothered!","I have stayed here many times over the years on business and I like the area being just outside the city centre and unique in having a decent size pool, hot tub, sauna and steam room and gym which I use every morning.
On this July trip however the rooms were hot due to lack of any air conditioning and with no mini bar to keep water and drinks cold so a sleepless night with a noisy fan blowing hot air around the room and if you open the window then you will be kept awake by the traffic and noisy people on the street late at night so you can't win.
I would imagine they would have to tear the place apart to put air con in so understandable but no excuse for a 4  star hotel not to fit mini bars in the wardrobes so at the very least you can cool down with a cold drink while you sweat the night away.
On another matter, when I came back here for the England V Ireland 6 Nations rugby match in March they charged me 250 Euros for a room and NO breakfast!!!
This is simply taking advantage of England fans charging 5 star hotel prices for a hotel just about a 4 star!!
My Irish business partner who introduced me to the hotel was so appalled he secretly paid for our room as a surprise when we checked in, you really must stop doing this on 6 Nations match days, it's bad practice.
Other than that good all round but I would not stay here if there was not a pool and gym in the basement.",4,2017,07,30
248,Great for business trips,"Lovely rooms supplied with fresh toiletries every day, close to many restaurants and bars, clean and nice breakfasts. Wifi was good enough for me to use my laptop whilst here on business. Rooms are a bit hot and can be noisy when windows open but overall excellent",5,2017,07,30
248,Great hotel,Check in was simple with a very pleasant helpful  member of staff.  Our room was everything we could want ...clean & comfortable with a safe and ironing board and plenty of tea and coffee.  Bathroom was a good size and lovely orla kielly toiletries.  This hotel is a little walk from city centre but easy to find and get around from. There are plenty of bars cafes etc for food on the route and this proved handy when we walked home late after being out for the evening. I used the pool which was quiet and clean.  Another bonus is the 757 bus to and from airport stops right outside.  This is the second time I have stayed here and I would definately stay again.,5,2017,07,30
248,Good location but a few let downs ,"Just returned from a night stay. Great location, a short walk into town and the airport bus stops just across the road. 
Check in was fine, given room up on the 4th floor. The room it's self was fine, a bit rough around the ages (holes in the chair fabric) but a good TV and comfy enough bed. 
We used the pool, which was lovely and just the right temperature. However, the toilet in the changing room was filthy, it didn't look like it had been cleaned for months! And as it was the only place of privacy in the changing room, we had no choice but to use it. 
It's a real shame there's no air con as the rooms get very warm, I thought this was a given in hotels now? Also have to echo what people are staying about having knocks on the door in the morning, hadn't even made it to 8am before they were trying to get us out of the room so it could be cleaned. 
Check out was swift, although our nights stay was fine, it's not somewhere I'd rush back to. ",3,2017,07,29
248,Lovely hotel with friendly staff,"Stayed just one night. Had a family room which was great and very clean. All the staff we encountered were very welcoming and helpful. It was in a perfect location for the concert we went to in Iveagh Gardens.
Would definitely stay here again.",4,2017,07,29
248,Nice hotel but one downside,Hotel was very nice and has a great bar but in the morning housekeeping knocked twice and just walked into my room. This was at 10am even thought check out isn't until noon. Everything else was fine. Great location near St. Stephens Green and the Luas.,4,2017,07,26
248,Rudest staff I ever met,First of all the woman at the desk on check in was nice but after this we were met with a wave rudeness from the staff. I asked for a taxi to go to our concert and the man at the front desk was extremely rude to me and made me feel embarrassed in front of other guests checking in. Then when we went for breakfast the following morning (that we already paid for at check in) we were told we had to pay €12 each. When we stated we paid the charge for breakfast already the girl argued with us and would not accept that we paid. We were told to sit down but we were given no apology for the mistake. Then during breakfast I went to the bathroom and while I was gone a member of staff tried to chat up my girlfriend. I'd expect this behaviour from a drunken buffoon in a nightclub at 2 in the morning but not from a member of staff at a four star hotel. I would never stay in this hotel again. It totally ruined our weekend and would not recommend it either,2,2017,07,26
248,Always relaxing to stay here,"I stayed at the Camden Court for 2 nights on my way to Kerry. It is fairly centrally located within easy walking distance of central Dublin ca. 20 mins, with the Luas (overground train) and buses on the doorstep. I love this hotel as it offers parking which I often need when coming back to Ireland, and it has a leisure center with a lovely swimming pool and Jacuzzi, plus sauna and steam room and all the gym equipment you could want. I prefer to just use the pool and the Jacuzzi to unwind from being on the road for almost a day. Breakfast was a pleasant surprise this time around - the last time I had breakfast there years ago it was nothing to shout home about.  This time though, it was great, high quality and all hot food well prepared. There was a huge amount of choice for every taste and staff were helpful and friendly. Can definitely recommend it. I also appreciated the wonderful porters who helped me with my luggage. Everyone in fact was helpful, friendly and a joy to interact with. Thank you, for making my first two days back in Ireland memorable and enjoyable.",5,2017,07,26
248,Great Hotel!,"This was our 2nd trip to Dublin for my parents and I. We were looking for hotels around the same location we stayed last time, since it was a zone we were more familiar with and Camden Hotel stood out because of its location, within walking distance from the center of the city (noting that Dublin it's not that big :) ), modern look & facilities and one of the few that offers family room (triple room in our case) saving us from having get an extra room. The room itself was comfortable and spacious. The staff was excellent.
Yes, there are a couple of bars around, 1 is right outside but from our room we didn't hear any loud music or voices so we weren't disturbed by it.

Overall, it's a great hotel,  I would recommend it.",4,2017,07,22
248,Pleasant stay in central dublin,"Great place to stay with good communication to Dublin city. Lovely hotel! Great breakfast and staff. Perfect way to get to and from the hotel from Dublin city! Take the bus to the river or take a walk for about 30min to the central streets, close to all the great places to visit for pictures and cultural interests!",5,2017,07,22
248,Not a four star,"I always try to be honest and find positives during my stay at various places. Unfortunately the bad outweighed the good on this occasion.

Upon check in, we were able to get into our room early which was brilliant after a 2 hours train journey from Belfast and the weather was scorching. However the receptionists were so busy talking between themselves that we were overcharged by €100! Unfortunately we did not notice this until we got home but after a quick email to the hotel, we were refunded quickly. Had the check in staff been paying more attention, this mistake would not have happened.

When we got to our room in the blazing heat, we were delighted to find it clean and bright, but the corridors were tired. However the heat was stifling! You are not able to open the windows due to safety catches and because we were above the busy main road, the traffic was deafening. No win situation. I now understand that the hotel provide fans on request - maybe something the staff should make clear when checking in, rather than having conversations with each other? 

After a good nights sleep? Forget it. Because we had to keep the window open all night (so as not to suffocate in the heat) all we could hear all night was traffic and drunk people directly outside the window. THEN, at 8.00am, a knock at the door from housekeeping. When check out is at noon and after a shockingly bad nights sleep, being disturbed at that time was utterly ridiculous. She apologised and ran off down the corridor... 

We did not have breakfast in the hotel as it was very overpriced.

There was a very helpful gentleman on reception who called us a taxi when we were leaving; he was arguably the nicest and most helpful member of staff we encountered.

Would I stay here again? No.
Would I recommend this hotel? Absolutely not.
Will I return to Dublin? Yes! In a heartbeat! Dublin is one of the friendliest and vibrant cities I have ever visited but this hotel was a big disappointment.

I really feel this hotel should join this century and invest in air conditioning. How it can be classed as a 4 star is beyond me",2,2017,07,22
248,Lovely Hotel ,I stayed here with work previously and it left a good impression so when we were going to a concert this was the first place I thought of.  Really comfortable clean rooms.  Parking was great.  Staff were so helpful.   Lovely seating area to watch the world go by.  Food in the bar was lovely.  Overall would definitely stay here again. 🖒,4,2017,07,19
248,Avoid room 351A!!,"My wife and I have just returned home from a two night stay (14 - 16 July) and on the whole enjoyed our stay although we had a few problems with the room - 351A. It was small as was the bed. In the bathroom the shower always seemed on the point of overflowing as the outlet seemed blocked and the temperature valve couldn't be turned so the shower was lukewarm at best. These were minor irritations which we reported on checkout and we were assured we would be allocated a better room next time!
On the plus side the breakfast was absolutely fantastic as was the one evening meal we had in the lounge and the hotel is in a good location and any staff we came in contact with were very helpful. We would stay again....but not in room 351A!!",4,2017,07,18
248,Great Location,This was the first trip to Ireland for my wife and I.  We were with Gate 1 Travel and stayed 2 nights here.  Beautiful hotel with very good and friendly service..  Was able to walk to numerous places and of course taxis were plentiful.,4,2017,07,17
248,Stay Away!,"One to avoid! - and I don't say that lightly!
Stayed here as it was adjacent to The Iveagh Gardens and a Dropkick Murphy's gig we were attending with good friends. 
On the face of it a half decent hotel but let down very badly once you scratch the surface - No Aircon!! The rooms are melting at best but if you manage to negotiate the safety clasp on the window you can get some air into the room ! 
But then the 75 million seagulls keep you awake from the crack of dawn! Which in July is obviously early! 
Just as the brain is beginning to accept the squeaking seagulls the hotel offers a new alarm call! 
0800 - tap tap tap on the door ..... so I open the door to a sheepish Eastern European girl who is already walking away down the corridor ... ""sorry I just checking rooms"" 
Forgive me but that's cheap cheap cheap!! Check out is actually noon! So why are you waking us up!! 
Never ever again - disgraceful city centre hotel !!!",1,2017,07,17
248,Great hotel,Convenient location to city centre. Clean hotel with good quality fixtures and fittings. Nice friendly staff and room maintained well by the maid service. All in all a great stay here and thoroughly recommend.,5,2017,07,11
248,Worst wi-fi,"This hotel is in a great location and the staff was good.  The included breakfast was also a good buffet.  The big downside that is unacceptable for hotels is poor wi-fi.  It worked in the lobby, but would regularly require one to re-login.  It was virtually unusable in our room.  We stayed twice about a month apart, thinking possibly they were having internet issues the first weekend, but it seems to be a normal thing for them.",3,2017,07,11
248,Great Staff - NO AC,"Okay, I understand it was unseasonably warm in Dublin, but it was summer!  NO Air Conditioning in a modern hotel and being told it was not ""usually"" needed didn't really help when it was in the mid to upper 80s in our room.  Opening a window helped a LITTLE, but really it just was NOT enough. Good luck if you stay here and the weather is warm.

The staff was super helpful in finding a better - accessible - room when our tour manager did not request one.  Be very careful which one you get because one of the rooms we looked at was so small (double) it would not have held a wheelchair and a suitcase.

Meals in the hotel dining area were very good (Breakfast and Dinner) for the 2 days we stayed. The Bleeding Horse Tavern, right next door, was available for a better veaiety of meals if the hotel food was not enough and other hours or lunches.",3,2017,07,09
248,Good hotel,The rooms were fine. The one thing you need is an extra key card. If you don't have one the bathroom lights will not stay on. Or the lights by the door. The room was good. The beds were a little soft. Also if you are on the outside by the street you can hear the noise from the road and the nearby pub. It can be loud. Don't keep the window open at night.,3,2017,07,09
248,Great area to stay in Dublin,We stayed here for two nights. The in house coffee shop was excellent. The staff were very helpful and friendly. You have so many great options for dining and night life nearby and within a walking distance. beds were comfortable and the rooms were very clean.,4,2017,07,04
248,Up Fri. Kerry  for a concert ,"Lovely hotel. Very clean. Staff very smart. Very professional.
Room fairly small for the price.
Hotel is situated in a great area for a pub night life. Make sure your room isn't on the main road as it gets getting busy at night. 
Breakfast wasn't  included so was an additional cost of €16 per person. There's no breakfast worth €16.
Staff were very efficient. Would definitely  return.
Great location. ",4,2017,07,03
248,GOOD LOCATION & GREAT STAFF,"It is a very dark hotel both in the reception area bar dining room and bedrooms. Excellent breakfast although it would be better if it was completely self service.There is no air conditioning in the bedrooms, I stayed twice the  room at the front of the hotel with the window open was very noisy. on my second visit I was on the 5th floor at the back of the hotel which was quiet but stuffy...bit a fan was provided. The bar was popular with locals and the reception area comfortable and spacious and an ideal spot to have an informal  business meeting",4,2017,07,01
248,Comfortable room,This hotel is very comfortable. Our room was a good size and facilities were clean and attractive. It was walking distance to many attractions and well served by buses. Being in the heart of the city meant it was a bit noisy. We had the window open as it was quite stuffy and hot. Air-conditioning would be a good feature to add. Breakfast was very nice with beautiful home baked bread and porridge. ,4,2017,06,23
248,2 night stay in Dublin,"Great clean hotel! Convenient location and friendly service.  Within walking distance to Trinity College and other major points of interest. 
The rooms were very clean and we'll appointed. Would definitely recommend this hotel, wish we could have stayed longer. 

I'd definitely recommend this hotel. ",5,2017,06,23
248,Surprised with those who like it,"The rooms (or the entire building) are old, and this is easily notable. There is no space for the legs when you sit on the chair to use a pc on the desk provided in some rooms. In some other rooms, this desk is no more than the size of two pcs... Wifi is totally unstable, not for those who really need it. Ques of up to 15 persons for a piece of bacon and an egg at the breakfast. Where by the way, you cannot setup your plate with what you like from the hot desserts, but you take only what they give you... Coffee machine is available in the room, but, at least in my room, it was located and operated within the closet!... in another room, there was no space at all to post and and open your luggage, having also almost no space available at all to put your clothes.. Signifciantly noise, and this is because is an old building... nice lobby, gentle staff, not ideal location for those interested for the city center... So that is why I'm surprised with those who have posted positive comments",2,2017,06,20
248,Nice room Good Service,"Stayed for 2 nights, found the room to be spacious and comfortable.  Hotel staff were good at accommodating requests.  Breakfast was good and they were able to satisfy dietary restrictions.  Not terribly convenient location if you're looking to see the various tourist stops in Dublin, but otherwise a fine hotel.",4,2017,06,19
248,Great business hotel in a very good location,"I've stayed here 3 times now, and each time I've been very pleased with it.  Rooms are clean, comfortable and well maintained.  You might ask for a room facing the interior of the hotel as exterior rooms can be noisy.  Food is tasty, and the service is always friendly and timely.  Plus, the hotel is in a good location is Dublin.  I'm sure I will stay here again.  ",4,2017,06,19
248,Excellent stay,"Check in was a breeze and our room looked really nice, Everybody at the Hotel were trying to be friendly and the succeeded! Our room was always kept to i high standard Bed were comfy enough. It took us about 10 - 15 minutes to walk to St Stephens green, wich was i nice start of the day. After receiving a very good breakfast! I used the pool once, it was great. The best experience were the staff and the worst was when i had to leave! I will return.",5,2017,06,19
248,Excellent,"Really good hotel. Bedrooms spotless, bed very comfortable, bedding lovely and soft.  Bathroom really clean with Orla Daly products. Good breakfast but slightly expensive.  Bit off a walk into Grafton street but central. Underground parking 10.00 euro per night (bit much for resident parking).",5,2017,06,18
248,Good choice in a good location,"The room was comfortable and clean.  Breakfast was very good.  We found to staff to be very helpful.  It's a bit of a walk to central Dublin, but doable.  There's really nothing negative about this place, it's not a luxury hotel, but it was a perfect choice for us.  Wi-Fi was free and adequate though not terribly fast.",4,2017,06,14
248,Quality at the center of town,"We spent 3 nights at the hotel. The location is convenient to all downtown attractions. We took the Airlink bus from the airport and got off just a few feet from the entrance. However, note that the Hop On/Off sightseeing bus stop is not nearby. The front desk staff couldn't have been more helpful in helping with lost luggage and taxis. The room, mattress and amenities are quality all the way. The breakfast is great, with many hot choices and variety. Two cons: there is only radiant heating, no AC or fan. this made the room stuffy. The duvets are enormous and heavy--felt suffocating in sleeping under them. Overall, we would return to lovely Dublin.",4,2017,06,13
248,Moderate hotel,"Stayed at this hotel because the hotel where we usually stay was fully booked. The hotel is rather dark as are the rooms. Breakfast is just ok, nothing special. They do have a gym, but it is open to the public as well so it can be very busy.",3,2017,06,13
248,Lovely stay,"Stayed here last weekend with my boyfriend for his birthday. I had emailed in advance to ask for an early check in, late check out and mentioned it was a birthday celebration. We arrived at 10am and a room was ready for us - the receptionist also wished my boyfriend a happy birthday which was a lovely touch. The room was nice, not the most modern but had all amenities you would need and a large bed. We were overlooking the courtyard but didn't find this to be noisy, even with the windows open (as the room did get incredibly warm at night). We didn't have breakfast included, apparently because we booked through expedia which was a shame. The hotel was a 15/20 minute walk from all of the main attractions, we quite liked the walk after eating all of the yummy treats Dublin has to offer. We used the leisure centre on Saturday afternoon - this was lovely! The receptionist was outstanding and went above and beyond for me when I forgot my swim gear - I didn't get her name but she was a blonde lady - fabulous member of staff and her hospitality was much much appreciated. We weren't able to have a late check out but we stored our bags no problem. Overall we had a great stay and would recommend.",5,2017,06,13
248,Best Best Best ,"This was my 8th stay at the hotel over last years. Perfekt Location, close to City Centre. Best and delicious breakfast. Good value for reasonable price. My favorite hotel in Dublin Centre. Looking forward to come back again. ",5,2017,06,12
248,"Efficient, modern, good value","Well located hotel, easy access to city centre and Luas, decent well appointed rooms, big breakfast facility, friendly staff, does all that you need from a city centre hotel. It was catering for a large event when I attended and was doing so very effectively. ",5,2017,06,11
248,So So,No air conditioning. On a noisy street. Be sure not to eat at the third rate restaurant in the hotel. There are noisy restaurants nearby and so it's important to close the windows. Then you have a stifling room,3,2017,06,11
248,Centrally located with great service,"Front desk staff were so friendly and attentive--more like an old-style, upscale hotel with a spacious lobby.

Room was very comfortable, though I do not like duvets! It was too warm to use it and too cool not to have coverings. Our room had a lot of street noise and no heating system fan to mask it.

Bath was well appointed with a lot of counter space.

Breakfast was an additional charge but well worth the expense!

Taxis could drive into the ""court"" for drop offs--very convenient and prevented loading and unloading in traffic. Hotel is close to the Hop On/Hop Off for touring.",4,2017,06,09
248,great location,"I would like to recommend this hotel, its in a centre of Dublin with all the amenities .
The rooms are very comfortable but the breakfast is a bit expensive .
The most is the swimming pool and the jakuzzi",4,2017,06,08
248,Fantastic hotel with a great location and friendly staff...,"I stayed in this hotel with my partner for the June bank holiday weekend, and we thoroughly enjoyed our stay. The staff were so friendly, and made sure we felt right at home. The rooms are spotless, and are really spacious and quiet. The bed was extremey comfortable and the bathroom was clean and modern. The location is brilliant, and it was very reasonably priced, and we also booked at the last minute, so we got a really affordable deal considering we didn't plan ahead. I would definitely stay again, and anyone looking for a well priced, modern hotel in the city should look no further than the Camden Court!",5,2017,06,06
248,"I've stayed here before, I should have known better.","While they advertise as having high speed internet that isn't true. The internet speed here is awful, you may as well not bother switching it on in the first place. Reception offered another network that was just as bad. It's a work trip, I need to be able to do work, and I can't without any internet connection. 

Also I ordered a meal from room service and when asked if I wanted to pay cash or credit card I said ""charge to the room"". The response was a threat to bring the card machine if I wasn't telling the truth! Very weird customer service. 

I won't be staying here again and I wouldn't recommended it to anyone else. ",1,2017,06,05
248,Nice hotel but can be noisy at night,"Staff was helpful, especially the desk person Dorian. He was very friendly and helpful. Do not get a room overlooking the courtyard. There is no air conditioning, so the windows must be opened. Late at night and early in the morning, trucks, deliveries, etc kept waking us up.  During our two night stay, there were several tour buses which at times caused congestion in hallways, elevators, breakfast, etc. Fair location to the heart of Dublin.",3,2017,06,04
248,Very nice central city hotel,"Camden Court is located a few blocks south of St. Steven's Green and another few south of Trinity College.  As such, the walk to popular attractions is a bit longer than some other hotels but not unduly so.  The hotel itself is very well appointed with a very large lobby, restaurant and bar.  Staff are friendly and helpful.  We only tried the restaurant for breakfast and that was a generous buffet spread of Irish breakfast foods.  Other meals were taken in nearby ethnic restaurants (Indian, Lebanese, Indonesian, etc.), all of which were very good (except next-door pub, Bleeding Horse, q.v.).  Rooms were small by U.S. standards but normal for Europe, and clean and well-equipped.  One especially nice feature was a Kerrigan-type coffeemaker in place of the usual cheap drip unit.  Would stay again.",4,2017,06,01
248,"Decent hotel, let down by a few resolvable issues.","We turned up early at the hotel after an morning flight and were very pleased to be able to get in to our room earlier than expected. Our first impression was that the room was very pleasant, comfortable and well equipped.

The gym and spa were very well appointed, but I would have expected the changing rooms to have had costume spinners and hair dryers. Not a bad thing to not have them, but usually a spa of that quality would have them.

There are only 2 issues that would make me question whether I would stay here again. Firstly, the Internet. We chose a hotel that had 'high speed internet' in the rooms because we needed to be able to Skype family. It was important to us, so to have a hotel advertise this and not deliver is very disappointing. The best I clocked was 0.45Mb. That's abysmal. I did mention it to reception and they gave me a different log on, and that was just as bad.

The other issue made it hard for us to get a decent sleep. I found the bed very comfortable so expected a good sleep. However, the room was extremely warm and made sleeping very difficult. Although the outside temperature wasn't that high (showers and overcast), the room temperature reached 25.5 degrees. With there being no air conditioning, we opened the window, and as we were over the courtyard, the bottles being recycled and coaches beeping when reversing early in the morning woke us up unceremoniously. So our choice was to close the window and have I even hotter, or open It and have no chance of sleeping in past 6 or 7 am.

The hotel is in a good position, and the staff are really nice and helpful so if they sorted out the Internet and added air conditioning, I would definitely stay here again. I would also add a star or two onto my review. If I could do it, I would have give 2.5 stars not 3, but without the issues, it would have been 4.",3,2017,06,01
248,Ok Stay,"Stayed here for our first few nights in Dublin before we headed out on an escccorted tour of Ireland. The first impression is very impressive with a nice big lobby, restaurant and bar. The staff were very helpful and the check in proess was very quick, which was a God send after a long red eye flight.
The rooms however while being clean are getting old and dated. The carpets are pretty rough and the furniture marked. Like most hotels in Europe, the rooms are smaller in nature. But the bed is comfortable and the linens are upgraded.
Ask for a bed that is not overlooking the courtyard. With all the services entering and exiting through there, along with the large number of bus tours which use the hotel, it can be loud all night. 
The breakfast is excellent with a huge selection of hot and cold foot.
The location is about a 30 minute walk from downtown Dublin. Easy stroll in pretty much a straight line. However, I would refrain from doing it at night as the area seems questionable.
Decent hotel, centrally located in a city where hotels can be hard to find.",3,2017,05,25
248,Disappointed,"Always walked by this place as it is right next to the Bleeding Horse Pub. Unfortunately, the Camden Court Hotel was a huge let down. Our first room had boogers, makeup stains, and used contacts in our beds. The manager was kind and apologetic, but put us in a less nice room (two twins instead of a twin and a full bed, lesser view, smaller) for the same price. Lastly, the wifi really doesn't work and I used my data the entire stay. Wouldn't stay again, dated and overpriced. ",2,2017,05,24
248,Centrally located spot!,"A wonderful experience start to finish.
The front desk was very helpful, we arrived early in the morning and they were able to get us a room right away. 
The room was great, great bed and great shower, key points for me and my wife while traveling. 
The one knock I have is the room was a bit cool, but my wife and I love very hot temperatures so I doubt most would feel the same way.
The Irish breakfast is delish, lots of foods to try and we didnt get board after 5 days of it. 
Through some would say the hotel is a bit off the beaten track I have to disagree, we felt like we were very central, close to shopping, restaurants and pubs.",5,2017,05,21
248,Better than average,"This hotel was really clean, the beds were very comfortable. We didn't eat here but we did use the leisure facilities. The pool was really nice and the Jacuzzi was lovely!

Would definitely book here again due to its good location, pool and cleanliness. Very nice Oral Kiely bath products in the bathroom. The room was decorated very tastefully.

I wasn't a fan of the room service menu choices, needs more vegetarian choices.",4,2017,05,19
248,Comfortable Hotel,"Good location, spacious rooms, nice extensive breakfast choice, great facilities including lovely pool and lively hospitable bar. Most staff very friendly and helpful but slightly let down by one or two individuals, especially chaps on reception, not very welcoming  or personable.",3,2017,05,17
248,Loved the Camden Court Hotel,"This is a great place to stay while in Dublin.  The rooms are modern, clean, and very comfortable.  It has a big, lovely lobby and bar, and the restaurant downstairs has an excellent breakfast buffet and other food throughout the day that is high quality.    There was also a pool but we never had time to try it.  It isn't right in the downtown but about a half mile or so walk, or a cab ride.  This can be an advantage since the hotel was quiet and away from a lot of street activity, while still being quite convenient to various tourist sites in Dublin.  There is a convenient bus to the airport across the street from the hotel. Something that really impressed me is when I happened to leave a few scarves behind in my room that were gifts. I didn't discover they were missing until later while back in the States, so I contacted the hotel, barely hoping someone would have found them.  Amazingly, they had them and mailed them back to me in the U.S.!  I felt that showed so much honesty and dedication that without question I would stay here again!",5,2017,05,15
248,Great accommodations and super friendly staff,"We enjoy three nights in our family suite which was well appointed. King sized bed! Couch, arm chair, desk and chair. Small round table and coffee table. Good lighting except for the bathroom, where the recessed ceiling light made shadows on your face. This makes it hard to shave through the shadows, let alone someone doing make-up.",5,2017,05,14
248,Highly Recommended.,"Just spent a weekend at Camden Court Hotel. This was a ""full on fun"" weekend in Dublin so basically we slept and had breakfast in the Hotel without exploring or utilising its other facilities. 
The room was absolutely fine for us and the breakfast on both mornings was truly sumptuous.
We didn't have great interaction with the Staff but we were certainly impressed with their friendly and helpful manner. Gabo on the Breakfast Service was a real ambassador for the Hotel. ",4,2017,05,14
248,They went above and beyond,"We arrived around 9 am from the airport, and my sister was feeling very ill.  The staff was able to find us a room within an hour, and let us check in early.  This was so kind of them,
and we really appreciated it.  They directed me to a nearby pharmacy to get medicine, and the next day were helpful with maps and directions.  This hotel was within walking
distance to the National Library and the Archives which was very convenient. I would
definitely stay here again, and highly recommend it.",5,2017,05,13
248,Great Stay at Camden Court!,"Really nice people work here!  Everyone just wanted to be helpful and give excellent customer service.  The breakfast buffet is wonderful.  Huge food selection, great food, and great service.  The dining room manager even offered to pack us breakfast for our last day there, as we were leaving before the restaurant opened.  Stores, restaurants, and bars are all within walking distance.  The indoor pool and large gym looked very nice, but we were touring all day.  I would have liked it if they were both open later.  I believe they both closed at 9:30pm.  Only other complaint was that the rooms really need ice buckets (they do have ice with styrofoam cups next to the machines).  We got the 3 day Freedom pass at the airport for $33 euros each.  This provided us with hop-on-hop-off bus, public bus service (which come often and we used a lot), and transportation from the airport that dropped us off across the street from the hotel (Airlink Express 757 to Camden-Charlotte Way).  Everywhere we went in Dublin everyone was very hospitable.  We look forward to visiting Ireland again in the future...",5,2017,05,13
248,"Great stay, no complaints","We stayed in a family room, which wasn't any bigger than any other hotel room I've ever stayed in. It did have two beds in it -- which, again, isn't usually exclusive to ""family"" rooms. But the service was fine; the room was clean; and the location was great. We'd stay here again.",4,2017,05,13
248,"Great location, with nice rooms, attentive staff, and excellent food.","Nice amenities in room including 2 bottles of water each day. Bathrooms were small but worked fine. Breakfast was very nice. The location was perfect for walking around town and taking in the sights. Convenient to the ""Hop On Hop Off Tour"" Bus service which ran often to several special tourist attractions such as Trinity College, St. Patrick's Cathedral, St. Stephen's Green, and more.",4,2017,05,12
248,Quality staff & great food!,"We stayed here last weekend on business. I was very happy with the service provided. The room was quite spacious and the bed was very comfortable and clean. I read reviews about noise complaints but I didn't notice any noise during my stay. Even the general traffic was quiet faint considering the hotel is located in central Dublin.

At dinner I asked for a bottle of wine that was not available. I also asked for an egg on my steak which possibly due to a language barrier the waitress did not understand me. I later asked a really nice receptionist for directions to a beauty salon who kindly drew a map of ""The Beauty Salon"" located nearby. It wasn't until my partner went for a swim that he released there was one in the hotel. Regardless of the communication barriers all the staff were extremely welcoming, We had a lovely meal and an amazing facial. Will definitely be back - C.Kenny",4,2017,05,11
248,A lovely hotel on edge of the city,"A very quick check-in on  arrival here. The bedroom roomy with twin beds, nicely decorated. The storage good, iron and board, a safe, but it was on the floor of the wardrobe. The room was very warm and no air con. Bathroom had a bath and shower, which was very good. Dinner was nice. BF the next morning was only buffet as the group was leaving to get a ferry, a nice selection for continental, but the drinks machine had no tea. At night the room was noisy due to it being near a main street and activity near the entrance. The hotel is near the Luas line to take the train into the city, only l stop. Service and staff all very helpful. Too hot for me, sorry.",4,2017,05,11
248,Very nice hotel,"We had a lovely stay. Couldn't ask for more. Would definitely recommend. Nice and clean rom and comfy bed. Wonderful continental breakfast, friendly staff.Good location to walk to. Tempel Bar and Guinness museum.",5,2017,05,10
248,Nice stay,"Stayed for 2 nights, staff was friendly and quite helpful. Rooms were clean and beds comfortable. Let us check in very early with no extra charge after taking a red-eye flight from Boston, which was much appreciated.",5,2017,05,08
248,Restaurant let down,"Stayed here for last night of our Ireland tour. Room comfy and clean, although coffee machine did not work. Good location to walk to Trinity College. Unfortunately evening menu very limited sekection. When I asked if there was an alternative starter, waiter simply said ""No"" very curtly. Another lady got the same response when she asked about an alternative dessert. Just a ""sorry"" would have helped.  I did not have a starter. The main course came with a sauce I did not like so I asked for no sauce but he still brought it in a jug. The dessert was lovely. 
Good hotel spoilt by poor staff attitude and limited menu selection.",3,2017,05,08
248,Very good not perfect ,"The great things about this hotel are location- everything is walkable, quiet room (on the court side), available parking, wonderful continental breakfast, friendly staff, very comfortable king bed
Things that need work- we stayed 2 nights and our room was never cleaned even though we hung the sign it was available to be cleaned, weak internet, broken safe was never fixed even after I reported this to the desk people, and the bathroom sink was slow to drain. ",4,2017,05,08
248,One night,Location of this hotel is ideal. The rooms are gorgeous and the beds are so comfortable. The staff were very friendly. Had breakfast the following morning and although it was expensive it was good quality food and a great choice available.,5,2017,05,07
248,Business trip in Dublin,Location in Camden Court is good for visiting the city center. It is within walking distance i.e. from Temple Bar and Grafton's street (for those who are use to walking). However Luas stop is just around the corner to explore other parts of the city. Hotel has a small gym and a pool which are free of charge for hotel guests. Rooms are spacious however some noise can be heard during early hours from the street. Have stayed here few times as conveniently located for my needs. Ok breakfast with selection of warm food.  Room service charge rather high.,4,2017,05,07
248,"""Really Nice""","This is a very smart and well run establishment and comes highly recommended.
Extremely friendly and helpful staff on reception and in particular a young lady by the name of Anna who has to be the most pleasant member of a reception team we have ever met. Rooms were comfortable and very clean plus safe and coffee/tea making facilities also provided.
Breakfast in the restaurant was of a good standard and the waiting staff attentive and pleasant. Perhaps the chefs actually serving the food could smile at least once a day!!!!
Overall we had a most enjoyable 4 day stay and would certainly return as and when the opportunity arises. Enjoy!",5,2017,05,07
248,Great stay but way too short,"The Camden has everything we needed. Great location, clean, attentive staff and quiet rooms considering the central location. On site car parking at €10 per night was excellent too. The swimming pool is small but very practical. My wife had a treatment and said it was very relaxing. When we were checking out the receptionist gave our little girl a lovely princess activity pack & she was over the moon. All in all our short stay was excellent and it would be top of my list for a return trip to the Capital.",5,2017,05,07
248,a very professional experience...,"The room was a little small but it was neat and clean and comfortable. I really liked the welcoming hotel's main lobby. It was a great place to sit , relax, and visit with friends. The hotel is located within easy walking distance of the shopping district and hundreds of great places to eat.",5,2017,05,06
248,One night in Dublin,"A colleague and I, travelling in to Dublin from UK, booked a couple of rooms at the Camden Court Hotel for an overnight stay prior to a customer meeting last Wednesday.  First impressions upon arrival were good, with the hotel being clean, reasonably well appointed and fairly busy.  Check-in service was friendly and efficient, and my room was clean, and a reasonable size.

As we'd had a long day, we decided to stay in the hotel for dinner rather than venture further afield.  This is where things started to go a little downhill.  Unfortunately, the restaurant staff seemed really inexperienced, and not at all familiar with the menu or wine list.  The young lady that was serving us seemed completely out of her depth and unfortunately her English language skills were very poor, so we were having to repeat our orders several times before she understood.  Further to that, my colleague ordered a class of chardonnay, and she appeared with a bottle of red.  She was keen and pleasant, and I don't wish to come across as harsh, but she just wasn't up to the job.  I place responsibility on hotel management, rather than on the poor woman herself, as she clearly needed more training.

After dinner my colleague and I wanted to order an Irish whiskey each, and the bar-man who took our drinks order, did not appear to know what products he had to offer.  Again, an indication of inexperience and/or a lack of training.

After I retired to bed, my room, which was llocated on an upper floor and overlooking a road junction proved to be rather noisy and I was kept awake for over an hour by a rowdy group of revelers who had clearly spent the evening in the pub across the road.  Better double or triple glazing to the room windows should perhaps be considered?

In summary:
Welcome: good
Room: large, comfortable, but could do with some better sound-proofing
Service: needs more work
Value: OK
Would I stay there again? Not if I could get a more advantageous rate at one of my preferred hotels",3,2017,05,05
248,Good Location but Underwhelming,"Pros: Room kept clean and fresh throughout our stay.  Hats off to the maid service
Friendly wait staff.
Great location, 15 minute straight shot to St. Stephen's Green
Nice lounge
Cons: Reception Service, Dorian was very rude.  
Terrible Wifi
Expensive food, not worth the price.  
Small room, not sound proof, no control over the window",3,2017,05,04
248,It was Ok,We stayed two nights. Rooms we very clean and well appointed.. very quiet! staff were OK. We always like to use a concerge when travelling in unfamiliar cities but they had none. Disappointing for our first two nights in ireland.,4,2017,05,04
248,Weekend away,"this is the 3rd time I have stayed at the hotel and it never lets us down, great location, the rooms are faultless and spotlessly clean,fantastic breakfast an in a very up and coming area, the pub ""the Bleeding horse"" just below the hotel is a great spot to start or indeed end your night",5,2017,05,04
248,Best Spa in Dublin,"I regularly stay at the Camden each month on business trips.I twisted my back during a game of golf with an important business meeting the next day I decided to chance a massage. The gentleman was extremely attentive. I was fortunate enough to get a booking that evening but I made sure to book back in with Cloud Nine. 

Lucaz P",5,2017,05,03
248,Birthday weekend visit,"Recently stayed here for two nights during the bank holiday weekend. The room was very clean and comfortable. The staff were welcoming and friendly. During our visit, we used the leisure centre facilities and made the most of the pool. We stayed in a room overlooking the courtyard (and not the main road) so we didnt experience any noise. Overall, we enjoyed our stay and were really pleased with our room and the hotel. 
",4,2017,05,02
248,Great for a family lunch or event,"Last week we had a family post-Confirmation lunch at the Camden Court for 8 adults and 3 children. We have had similar get togethers there over the years and, yet again, we were not disappointed by the food and service. We were given a reserved private area at the back of the dining room. The food, off the set lunch menu, was good, but being a set menu a bit limited in variety. Both adults and children seemed happy with the lunch, the hake getting great comments from those who ordered it. The waitress service was very friendly, helpful and attentive. For the adults the bar service was very good. A good selection of wines was available, including by the bottle. Importantly the draft Guinness was superb, on tap and the bar and lounge staff were very friendly and accommodating. I have been to business meetings there in the past, and the conference facilities and self service lunch were very good.
I am sure we will be back again for a similar family event in the future.",4,2017,05,01
248,Nice to be back at the Camden Court.,"Visited in April 17, last been September 16. Nice to see it back to how it used to be service etc was great. September visit was not as good. This visit was a vast improvement. Will be back later in the year on business. ",5,2017,05,01
248,Short stay at Camden,"Reception was efficient, the room was nice and clean. The breakfast was not anything special. If you want to find a decent priced hotel within walking distance from the center, this is your place. Remember to bring your adapter.",3,2017,05,01
248,Good hotel in a central location. Weak wifi.,Large comfortable rooms and six floors in total. Some rooms face the courtyard while others face the street. Bed is comfortable. Bathroom is functional although not very large. TVs are modern and support Netflix if you have an account. Hotel is located centrally and staff are very good. Worth noting that the wifi is quite weak in the hotel and frequently slows to a crawl.,4,2017,04,30
248,Superb stay,"What an excellent hotel, could not fault in anyway whatsoever...rooms clean and spacious, the dining facilities were excellent, the food was top notch, the spa was very clean and the staff were a credit to the company....again excellent stay would highly recommend ",5,2017,04,30
248,Can see the attraction-but!,"Stayed for 3 nights, overall it's getting a bit tired, the rooms on the Main Street are extremely noisy if you go to bed before 3am at a weekend. On the plus side staff are very pleasant and the lady at breakfasts tries really hard to please!",3,2017,04,28
248,Ok ,"Well situated near St Stephen's Square.
Clean.
Basic functional city centre hotel.
Nothing extraordinary.
Can't say any really negatives nor any exceptional positives.
Breakfast is buffet style - again ok, room for improvement.
Staff are all very nice and efficient.
There is quite a nice small fitness area and a decent sized pool.
The Vanilla Browns wellness centre is good - I had a great massage.",3,2017,04,27
248,Not pleased,The floor we we're on had construction & they claimed to have been full. We woke up too drilling & hammering at 8:30 a.m both mornings. That's early when you have jet leg & need to catch up on sleep! The floor they put us on should ho e been closed.,2,2017,04,26
248,Great stay,"Good hotel for families, very comfortable and well situated in the city.
Excellent breakfast and very good food in general.
Friendly personal, especially in the restaurant.
The nice pool is a great plus.",4,2017,04,20
248,Lovely Hotel ...,"I booked this hotel based on reviews from other families and on entering the reception area I was pleased, very inviting with a nice atmosphere, check in was quick.  Our room was clean, comfortable size with an added bonus of a coffee machine.  We slept well, check out was at 12 so I was looking forward to a lie in and a relaxing morning until workmen started outside our door at 9 am, I understand they have a job to do but on check in it would have been nice to have been forewarned about these works.  It ruined what we had planned to be a relaxing morning. I'm normally not one to complain about things but on check out I wasn't given the chance to bring it up, overall a very pleasant hotel but if I'm to stay in future, I will be checking if there is works going on first.",4,2017,04,19
248,Nice quiet hotel,"We were looking for a hotel close enough to the centre without being right in the middle of the night life. I was pleased with our choice. We had a quiet room on the 5th floor. We had a comfortable stay. The room was clean and of a decent size. The hotel pool, sauna and jacuzzi are definitely an added bonus which we took advantage of. We didn't book breakfast but did have it one of the mornings. Very good. Cooked breakfast and plenty of other options to go with it.  Although €17 each felt a bit on the expensive side but I suppose comparable for other places in Dublin. The area seems to be 'up and coming'. Some nice little bars, pubs and restaurants all within 5 minutes walk (thai street food at Neon was very good) inbetween some more run down shops and empty buildings. Less of a touristy feel in the area which suited us but depends what you prefer. 10-15 minute walk to St Stephen's Green and Grafton street. 20 minutes to Temple bar or a quick taxi ride. We walked to St Stephen's and got public transport to most attractions or walked if a reasonable distance but depends on your preference. Small things: there were some scuff marks on the wall as we entered the room (didn’t impact on our stay but affected our 1st impression). We arrived for breakfast 15 minutes before it finished but had staff packing everything away and cleaning up around us while we were still eating. Otherwise a really nice stay.",4,2017,04,15
248,Fabulous ,Top class hotel will definitely be back for a longer stay. Got a welcome plate of little cakes which was nice to start the night. Rooms are perfect and there was no error with any of the trip. Will be back ,5,2017,04,15
248,Decent for a quick work meeting,"I Met a colleague for lunch here. We both Got the soup and sandwich which was circa €6.50. It was Good value, solid food considering it was soup and sandwiches. The Service was a bit slow but I wouldn't hold that against them. We sat in the r caption area and the seat were quite low so it was slightly uncomfortable trying to eat. I'm saying that we didn't look around so Overall a fine experience. ",3,2017,04,14
248,Great hotel not sure about the area,We arrived early morning and when we got there our rooms weren't ready. We had a coffee and within half an hour our rooms were ready and we were able to leave our cases in the rooms leaving us a full days sightseeing. The rooms are great with plenty of toiletries. We ate out across the road at Monto the only restaurant in the area although there's a pub next door.,4,2017,04,12
248,TOO DAMN NOISY!!!!,"TOO NOISY....I guess since I was solo they gave me a room with a A at the end of it.Which meant it was half a room.  Too small, very worn, needed painting.  The heat is just too hot.  I opened the window, it opens very little.",3,2017,04,11
248,"Overall bad experience, more like a two stars hotel","Location is good, 10-15 minutes walk to center.
This building looks very old and needs to be renewed.
Compared to other hotels around the world, this one would deserve 2 stars.
Rooms are small and dark.
Far too expensive for what you get !",1,2017,04,11
248,Home Run Refurb and Now Truly Grand in the Dublin Sense,"Stayed here a few years ago and it was a solid business hotel with some refurbished rooms, excellent location and some notable quirks such as weird retro coke machines when you exited the elevator and a transition endearing shabiness in parts. Nonetheless super solid. What a change in a few years - they have done a complete refurbish including to the lobby - all spanking new, very tasteful and great rooms redone with an attention to detail, high standard bathrooms, very large business level safes in the rooms. wide screen TVS, business phones in the rooms with speakers. excellent lap pool plus upgraded spa in the basement and a solid restuarant and coffee bar. Rooms very large and quite and great linen also. Also the streets nearby have zoomed up into the hot next thing category with multiple choices of food of all choices from a great pub on the corner to terrific Indian and high end Veggie (I tried Green 19 which I recommend half a block away). 15 minutes by taxi max to the docklands and 10 minutes to any central Dublin business meeting.  You can't beat this including for the price. High end for more than reasonable rates. Enjoy.",5,2017,04,07
248,What more could you want,"I have stayed here quite a few times and its always the hotel I book when visiting Dublin. Really central to everything. Free parking is a big bonus. Nice relaxing quiet hotel, good bar food and the restaurant is lovely if you want something a little more than bar food. Rooms are always clean and gauranteed a good night sleep, great decor throughout and the staff are very friendly.",4,2017,04,06
248,great city  location,"rooms were very nice and tidy , room was a little hot .... A little expensive for  a double room for one night. breakfast good , with lots of stuff to choose from .there is a swimming pool that can be used , looked great .",4,2017,04,05
248,Perfect Location!,Stayed here 3 nights in March.  The hotel is located within walking distance to great shopping and many points of interest including Trinity College and St Stephens Green .   Nice clean rooms with friendly and helpful staff.,4,2017,04,01
248,Good but not perfect ,"Great break, very nice hotel & friendly staff.  Good location to walk to Grafton Street and all the main sites.  A little noisy but expected in a  city centre.  We had a  water leak in the bathroom which wasn't fixed but did not effect us - just disappointing.   Room good but not as large as the photos imply.  ",4,2017,04,01
248,Busy but good,"We were there for the 6 Nations match and the hotel was very busy especially at breakfast time, where I felt we were being rushed through - cooked food almost thrown on to ones plate at a hundred mil;es an hour! However, that being said, it was well positioned for walking in to the heart of Dublin for the shops and pubs. The rooms were comfy and clean.",4,2017,03,31
248,Great value,"Hotel in a good position with numerous pubs and restaurants close-by and only a short walk to St Stephens Green and Grafton Street. Although our room was at the front of the hotel, it was quiet. The room was a standard twin, very clean and comfortable. The bathroom was clean with an excellent power shower and there was even a full sized bath. All the staff were friendly and very help full. We arrived at lunch time and found their food carvery very good value. We travelled by train to Connelly station and took a taxi with a fare of €13. Worth it as it is a long walk, especially with a suitcase. At the front of the hotel is a stop for the Airport Bus. Will stay here again.",5,2017,03,28
248,Feb Visit ,"Stayed here for a few days. Overall good not great. Rooms themselves are basic. Hotel located in the heart of a lot of pubs and restaurants and clubs if that's your thing. Front desk staff overall very pleasant. Wifi was hit or miss but was included in our price. Breakfast was a buffet and was sufficient but nothing spectacular. Located away from most ""tourist"" locations but within 10-15 min walk. Needed to sleep during the day and the were renovating a few rooms not far from our room and was very very loud. Once they stopped the overall ambient noise outside picks up. Street rail car located block behind and you will hear it. But I would stay again and front desk staff very friendly and attentive.  ",4,2017,03,26
248,St Patrick's day & Rugby ,"A group of 8 of us stayed at this hotel for St Patrick's day & to watch Ireland V England in the RBS 6 Nations. Lovely hotel in a central location. The hotel is modern inside with free wifi. The bar staff are friendly and helpful with a reasonable priced bar & snack menu. 
The breakfast is well stocked and really tasty. 
Rooms have everything you need, TV, Iron & board, hairdryer, coffee machines and bottles of water. The rooms were clean and comfortable. 
Would definitely stay here again & recommend to friends ",5,2017,03,23
248,Good business hotel,"Good room, good location, good bar in the lobby downstairs, effective and kind receptionist, good pub very close to the hotel for a nice pint. Bus stop to airport is just across the street. Maybe it's a little expensive for regular tourists. ",5,2017,03,21
248,St. Patrick's day / six nations rugby,"This is a really good hotel ideally placed to explore Dublin, staff were great.
The buffet breakfast was really good plenty of choice and the bar has possibly the cheapest Guinness in Dublin.
We have stayed in this hotel twice now and would thoroughly recommend it.",5,2017,03,21
248,Great Location,"Great location, handy to Temple Bar and the centre of town. Rooms are spacious, clean and the pillows are heaven. Breakfast was tasty and the staff couldn't do enough to help. A lovely place for a night away.",5,2017,03,21
248,"Good location, noisy and no aircon!","Great location, make sure you don't go when they have coach trips on.  Gulliver's were there with a Rugby tour.

Huge queues for breakfast, no-one wanting to serve tea and coffee, easier to do it yourself if you can find a cup!

Room on road side was beyond noisy with rowdy street partiers until 4-5 am.  Window needs to be open as no air-con and it averaged about 25 degrees with the radiators turned off!

Breakfast quality questionable, not sure if it was because the tour was in the but the sausages were probably the cheapest you could find.",2,2017,03,20
248,5* ST PATRICK'S STAY,"This is my first ever trip advisor review and I'm more than happy to give it to Camden Court. Stayed here for St Patrick's festival and I couldn't fault the hotel at all. The rooms were spotless and incredibly comfortable. Only a short stroll to the City Centre and Temple Bar. (Also great access to the aircoach, from the Airport).

Reception checked us in early after an early morning flight, so at 10am we were in our room - this was without request. Couldn't fault the service at all!
Breakfast is a great add on. Excellent choice and fairly priced. I would 100% return. 

I also recommend the pub next door for a late night stop on the way home from a busy sightseeing day, I think it's called 'the bleeding horse', great atmosphere and nice food if your a little peckish. Either has music on or sport. Definitely worth the nightcap!",5,2017,03,20
248,"Excellent, immaculate service from a top hotel","Hotels stand or fall on their service. This one stands miles tall despite being full with demanding Rugby fans. The staff didn't flap they all coped very well. Nothing was too much trouble. Room service brilliant. I was impressed to see that on Saturday morning, the receptionist did a spell handing out the hot plates at breakfast, to keep things turning over. Superb swimming pool and health suite. Great late night bar, and efficient business centre to get letters printed. Wifi network good and strong throughout the hotel. Car parking too. Definitely my hotel of choice in Dublin.",5,2017,03,19
248,Great stay,Here on a family vacation. Staff friendly and helpful. Rooms first class.. Old world charm with modern amenities. Convenient to Dublin sites. Easy walkk to Trinity and St Stephens Green. Good stretch of the legs or a short can ride to Temple Bar section of Dublin--many goos restaurants and Pubs in this area.,5,2017,03,16
248,Excellent service and location,"Stayed at Camden Court for 3 nights, everything top rate, spotless room with everything you need. Free fruit in reception, free newspapers, and free flavored chilled water in reception. Nothing was too much trouble, ordering room service, or parking inquiries and help with luggage to your room. Swimming pool and Jacuzzi a real treat after a long hard day was just what I needed to de-stress. 

A bit pricey at 135e per room, but if you can afford it, then its worth it, as has everything you need from a little coffee shop to a full on restaurant or bar meals. Buses stop outside, Luas (Green Line) does too but you can walk to Grafton Street with ease. 

Only complaint was I had required a room on the quiet side of the hotel but was woken two mornings in a row with work being carried out on the room next door. 

But when I complained about this I was given 50e off the bill, with no quibbles or arguments. 

Excellent hotel with all your needs met, and no hassle.",5,2017,03,15
248,"Good Location, nothing to WOW you.","My wife and I stayed here the beginning of March, on a group tour.  The hotel is somewhat nicely located for tourists.  If you don't mind about a 15 minute walk to the Temple Bar area.  The hotel was nicely kept up, but the rooms could have used a little updating.  I believe they are in the process of updating the hotel, so that will help.

Breakfast had lots of options and the smoked salmon was very good.

Overall, I'd recommend this hotel if you get it at a good price.  I think this hotel would be better suited for business, but it's not bad for tourists.",3,2017,03,14
248,Good Hotel,Stayed here during our latest 3 night Dublin vacation. Staff were friendly and welcoming. The rooms were clean and warm. The pool and sauna etc were added bonus for filling in a  couple of hours before changing for dinner. Located next door to the  bleeding horse pub which was also good. There is a bar and restaurant on site but we did not get to try them on this occasion but they seemed to be busy which is usually a good sign.,4,2017,03,13
248,Family catchup,I had the opportunity to stay at this hotel this month.  ideally located it is within walking distance of the sights in Dublin. The family I was meeting travelled from the UK and were very happy with the service.  Staff very friendly and helpful. Breakfast was optional but is worth having. A busy hotel I will return .,4,2017,03,13
248,"Great hotel, great location! ","Was working in Dublin for a week and simply chose the closest hotel to the office. What a find!!! 
Smart, modern with great service too. The room was well set out and clean. 
Perfectly situated next to a great Irish pub (Bleeding Horse) and on the incredible Camden Street for some amazing restaurants. 
Pretty good price too! Enjoy your stay! ",5,2017,03,12
248,S'alright,"This establishment exceeds my peerlessly high expectations in a spectacular fashion. The laystaff have been extremely simple for one to confabulate with, and their enthusiastic service has been one to rival even the most esteemed of establishments.

My 7-Up was prepared under nothing but the highest standards imposed by both myself and the Bord Bia culinary standards.

The atmosphere, mediocre in nature, was far too reserved and tranquil for me. The contemporaneous guests were quite dull and many of them simply could not remain awake, not that I blame them.

At one point, I was intrigued by the choice of music. Only a true virtuoso could fathom a such a truly inspiring and permeating sonnet such as Smash Mouth's All Star. Unfortunately, the gravamen of the situation was revealed to me when I realized that All Star was NOT being played and I was simply audibly hallucinating.

The facilities were fashioned in a nature, prepared to accommodate the hefty bowels of a hefty gentleman.

Overall, the experience was rather drab and contemporaneous in nature.",5,2017,03,11
248,A Night at Camden Court,"We totally enjoyed our visit to Camden Court! Everything was clean and the rooms were beautiful! We had a wonderful dinner and drinks in the pub while watching the rugby match, Wales vs Ireland! Great experience!",5,2017,03,11
248,Change from the Hilton,"Normally stay at the Hilton which is a 5 min walk away, but chose this to try it's gym and pool.

The rooms are new and clean. Huge issue is sound proofing between rooms.... you can hear everything.

Gym area is fairly well equipped, it gets crowded and it also needs a real good clean.

The gym changing rooms have a terrible damp smell when you go in through the doors.

The pool is small but better than the Hiltons!

The facilities here are better than Hilton, with bars and restaurants supporting the gym and pool.

Hilton wins for breakfast quality and sound proofing!",4,2017,03,08
248,One night,"Comfortable and clean room. Given the proximity of this hotel to local pubs and night clubs, there was no noise at night. Pleasant and helpful staff and good selection of food for breakfast.
There is underground parking.",4,2017,03,07
248,Birthday treat,"Stayed two nights in February 2017. Very nice hotel, lovely breakfasts. Nice clean and comfortable room. Ideal location, coach from airport straight to door of hotel. I would certainly stay again. Nice pool area. Staff very friendly.",5,2017,03,06
248,Pros vs Cons,"PROS:
* location is great. There are bars and restaurants very close by. Hit up the Noddle house a few blocks away. 
* Service is great. From the people at the front desk to the bar staff, everyone was very nice and helpful. 
* Rooms. They were well kept and appeared to very clean.
* Transportation.  The airlink shuttle number 757 arrives and departs right in front of hotel. It's 10 euros for a round trip to airport. 

Cons: 
* Spa and pool hours. They were only open till 8:30, which in my book is a no no. 
* small bathroom and no bathroom vest fan. The mirror was hard to see through and it appeared that the room was suffering from moisture damage on the ceiling.  The room was rather small and having the bathroom light switch near the front door was also a little annoying.  

The pros grossly out weighed the cons and it would be a  pleasure to return.  ",4,2017,03,06
248,Perfect!,"I stayed at this hotel with my girlfriend for 4 nights over the 2016/2017 NYE celebrations. 

The staff are polite and helpful, rooms were clean and suitable size. It is in a ideal location just South of St Stephens Green away from the noisey areas from the city centre. 

100% will be going back! ",5,2017,03,06
248,birthday treat.,"My partner booked this hotel for my surprise birthday treat, its a nice clean and family friendly hotel. The staff were very pleasant and helpful,
the rooms were spacious although some outside noise was heard early sunday morning. The bar was a decent bar with sport on the TVs.
It does seemer farther than the 15-20 minute walk to temple bar which we was told but still a nice hotel.",4,2017,03,02
248,Good clean hotel,"Stayed at Camden Court for 3 nights in Feb. Its a good clean hotel and the staff are really friendly and hospitable. 

On the practical side of things, the wifi is quite weak and if you are facing Camden street, the road noise is very disturbing when you sleep. 

Maybe consider rooms on higher floors or away from the main road.

Enjoy your stay! ",3,2017,02,26
248,Terrific location & staff - 10 minutes walk to city center.,"We stayed here between 02/17/17 and 02/25/17. The hotel is very well located; a short 10 minute walk to St Stephen's Green and Grafton St. The staff is very courteous. They provided us with early check-in as our flight arrived early morning. We had a relatively quiet room on the 5th floor, which overlooked the courtyard. The entire staff went out of their way to ensure that our every need / request was accommodated to the best of their ability. The heated pool was a hit with my 6 year old son, while my wife and I appreciated the hot tub and sauna. We plan to return to Dublin in 2019 and Camden Court Hotel will be our only choice. Thank you to all the folks who made our trip so enjoyable. 
A special thank you to the hotel's reservation agents with whom I communicated on a regular basis prior to our departure, asking a whole load of questions which they patiently answered - Louise Griffin and Siobhan Brown. You folks really are aces in my book.
My only one request is that they provide a table in each room, because this would make it easy to eat our room service meals.",5,2017,02,25
248,A really nice place,"Stayed here last summer and really liked the hotel.  It's in a nice neighborhood with lots of pubs, restaurants.   Management was very friendly and helpful.  The Airlink to the airport is across the street.  Great breakfast, too!",5,2017,02,24
248,Very good choice,"Comfortable and friendly hotel, reasonably priced and with a excellent location, in front of the last stop of Airlink 757 bus and with all the city's best assets at a walking distance. Abundant and well-assorted breakfast, The room was somewhat small and decorated in a maybe too classical style, but the bed was large and extremely comfortable, The staff was generally kind and very attentive.",5,2017,02,23
248,Wonderful hotel and at a reasonable price!,"Went for a girls' weekend in Dublin - lovely hotel and brilliant value for money. Situated in the colourful Camden Street, we were always able to find interesting bars and restaurants in the evenings whilst still only being a short walk from the more touristy centre of the city. The room was very attractive, and more importantly comfortable. Having full access to the basement leisure centre was another great factor - the jacuzzi was ideal after a day of walking course Would definitely go back - my only petty criticism was that they need to update their hairdryers!",4,2017,02,20
248,Competition Winner ,"Thanks for our lovely stay as part of a competition ran by Dublin Sightseeing,  we had a great stay.  Everything was lovely: the room,  the leisure facilities and the breakfast.  Great place.  Highly recommended.  The Airlink 757 stops right outside which is perfect.  Great traditional Irish pub next door called the Bleeding Horse.....great for a Guiness.  Thanks again ",5,2017,02,17
248,"A quiet, friendly experience","We enjoyed the hotel very much. The staff was friendly, our room was well appointed and very clean. The breakfast, while not included in the cost, was quite extensive with hot and cold offerings, and the waitstaff was professional and helpful.   It was within walking distance of St. Stephens Green, Trinity College and many pubs and restaurants. Also for those who fly into Dublin, the AirLink bus stops right across the street from the hotel. We would definitely recommend this accommodation.",4,2017,02,15
248,Great service,"Stayed with 2 friends in a gigantic family room. A Small  issue - (noise from other guests),dealt with very promptly by security staff. Manager comped breakfast and parking the next morning. I discovered I left my laptop in the dining room and when I rang it had been safely locked away in the hotel safe ready for collection by me.
Excellent service- we'll be back!",5,2017,02,14
248,Business Trip,"I recently stayed in this hotel on a recent business trip to Dublin. It is very well located for many of the large business in Dublin and has a wealth of bars and places to eat around it, if you don't fancy the hotel bar and food. The rooms are quite large with comfortable beds and large flat screen TV's, the bathrooms are quite modern with a good selection of toiletries and lovely soft towels. Breakfast was good with a great choice of hot and cold dishes and a decent selection of Coffee, I would definitely recommend this hotel and stay again when in Dublin!",4,2017,02,13
248,Better than before,"I was initially impressed by the recently refurbished room.  Nice modern bathroom and a large flatscreen TV.  The room was comfortable, clean and tidy.  They've improved their breakfast too, much higher quality than before!",4,2017,02,10
248,Very Nice Hotel,"In Dublin for business for few days and stayed here for the first time. An excellent hotel with comfortable rooms, good service and an excellent gym. Had dinner in the Iveagh Restaurant one night and the food was very good. Shame I was having a dry month as I did fancy trying the wine, ah well, perhaps another time. As an extra note, the 757 bus from Dublin airport stops right outside, very useful.",5,2017,02,09
248,Access room very bad,"I stayed here before and liked it but this time it was less appealing. I was sharing an Accessible room with a friend who uses a wheelchair. The room was unsuitable. Just five examples: 1) No removable shower head so she couldn't shower. 2) All access rooms above the smoking space - bad for everyone but particularly so for people with health conditions. 3) Carpeted flooring bad for wheelchairs. 4) Small space and lots of furniture that needed to be moved so the room could be navigated. 5) The kettle is in the wardrobe on a shelf!!! Either people risk scalding themselves or don't drink tea or can't reach the kettle. 

Other than that I've not had problems with the hotel. ",3,2017,02,08
248,Lovely hotel ,"Was up here for a few days and it offered so many services that were great. The gym and the swimming pool were very nicely set up and the sauna and steam room were also a nice touch. The only complaint I have about this hotel is that the woman who served my breakfast each morning was rather rude and abrupt on 2 of the mornings, other than that quality hotel.",4,2017,02,07
248,Camdem Hotel Dublin,"Very fine hotel for a city trip to Dublin, well located close to commercial streets, including Irish excellent hospitality (and full Irish breakfast) and nice and large rooms. Did not try the swimming pool, but it is there!",4,2017,02,06
248,Great breakfast,"This recent hotel is very well located (not far from the center and with all facilities around) , rooms are large and so clean, staff friendly and the breakfast is really good. The swimming pool is long enough for some real swimming. I enjoyed this stay very much.",5,2017,02,02
248,Nice hotel but stay frustrated by useless unusable internet. ,Hotel is fine with a good gym. However the internet connection borders on unusable with constant dropping and lack of speed. It was ok on Sunday when not many people were here but as soon as it got busy in the week it was useless. For that reason I will not stay here again in a hurry as it was very frustrating.,3,2017,02,01
248,will be back!!,"I've stayed in the hotel last November but simply had no time to write a review.
Hotel is nice, great location - close to city center. Room could be bigger but it was clean and comfortable. Attentive staff, especially Reception Manager helped me efficiently with my small issues. I will be back.",5,2017,02,01
248,Great time,"Stayed for two nites,great facilities,very central,food and service excellent,well done,shall definitely be back,room warm and comfortable,luas just round the corner,getting to Grafton street and shops very easy,all around a very pleasant stay,many thanks",5,2017,01,31
248,Comfortable hotel with friendly staff,"Lovely room, with a comfy bed and excellent bathroom
Breakfast was tasty, and the bar meals were good quality and well presented.
All the staff were friendly and helpful
The pool and sauna were relaxing after a busy day",4,2017,01,29
248,Good location,"Just 10 minutes walk from St Stephens Green and the shops, this area has some interesting shops, bars and places to eat. The hotel was fine - big comfortable bed, clean, though I had a room on the second floor overlooking the main road. The room was very hot and opening the window meant traffic noise. I'd suggest earplugs but I'd stay here again as convenient. ",4,2017,01,28
248,"Terrible wifi, otherwise good","Pros:
- The location is great.
- It has a nice pool for laps, sauna, steam room, decent gym, so great for getting some exercise while traveling.
Cons:
- Terrible, terrible wifi. I haven't had such a poor experience with wifi at a business-y hotel in years. Don't book this hotel if you need to get work done from your room that requires internet access.",3,2017,01,26
248,Consistently great,I stay here regularly when in Dublin on business.  It's a wonderful place to stay. The staff are so welcoming and efficient and friendly. Two recent big improvements too. The addition of 2 suites. Stayed in one last night. Gorgeous. And the second a new room service menu. Great choice and taste and healthy options. I hate to stay anywhere else in Dublin now. ,5,2017,01,25
248,it has wifi so bad that there is basically no wifi,"Had to stay here for business, very busy stay with a lot of work to do and the wifi frustrated me to my wits end. continual and long drops in service daily. staff cannot do anything about it. Hotel is otherwise fine and well located, if you are thinking of working from the hotel though, forget it.",2,2017,01,18
248,Good facilities but pricey!,"Large room with all usual amenities and facilities overlooking inner courtyard so quiet.Room warm and comfortable. Stayed over New Year so very pricey ! Staff friendly and helpful eg what bus to catch to town.
We did not eat in the hotel at all ( breakfast was at a lovely coffee shop down the road , and there are plenty of restaurants in the area) or have time to use the health club so can not comment on either of those facilities.
Good location for a city hotel with easy access by bus to airport and city centre.",4,2017,01,18
248,Wonderful New Year's Visit,"My partner and I greatly enjoyed our time at Camden Court. We stayed for three nights over the holidays. We flew in from New York, and arrived in Dublin around 5 am after a red-eye flight. Neither of us had been able to sleep on the plane, and were praying we'd be able to check-in to our room *very* early in order to get some rest. Check-in was at 2 pm, I believe and we showed up at Camden Court at 5:45 am. The desk attendant was so kind helping us with our bags and getting us at the door (if you arrive before a certain hour you have to ring a lobby bell for security reasons). And luckily he was extraordinarily accommodating and provided us with a room right then in there, hours before our room was supposed to be ready. I cannot thank them enough for this. I had emailed ahead of time to let the staff know we would be arriving early, but I knew there was no guarantee a room would be available. 

Beyond this incredible accommodation they provided us the room was very tidy, the bed was quite comfortable, and I really enjoyed the complementary bath products. We also took full advantage of the spa and pool, the staff working the recreation center were lovely. The hotel is a short walk from the main tourist/shopping area, very close to public transit, and the bus to and from the airport stops literally across the street. Also in very close proximity to the hotel is Bretzel's Bakery which was perfect for taking a few minute walk and bringing breakfast back to our room. We greatly enjoyed our time here, and the staff were very generous and kind. They happily provided room service, wake-up calls, ordered taxis, and assisted in printing boarding passes. I greatly recommend staying here if you are looking for a comfortable and professional experience.",5,2017,01,11
248,New Years Eve Stay,My sister and I stayed in this hotel for just a night. Although it was a busy time of year the hotel always had a calm relaxing and welcoming feel. The room itself looked exactly like the photos and the shower was incredible. A five minute walk from Stephens Green which is perfect for any trip to Dublin. I will happily stay again only for longer next time.,5,2017,01,10
248,Good location ,We picked Camden Court as it's close to the Odeon bar (next door) and it's only a 10 minute walk to Stephens Green then a further 5 minutes to the town centre. The rooms are nice enough with enough space and the pool area is OK.,4,2017,01,09
248,New Years Eve stay,"Wonderful hotel, large spacious room, emailed previously to state that it was my girlfriends 21st and we got an upgrade with a note and chocolates which we thought was a lovely touch. 

Excellent bar which shows all the sports, I never tried the swimming pool etc. so cannot comment but the staff were lovely and extremely helpful and we had an amazing stay. 

Cannot recommend highly enough, one downside was the wifi which is very patchy at best although we were on the 6th floor which may have had something to do with it.",5,2017,01,04
248,New year stay,"Stayed for 3 nights over new year. Nice hotel, nice staff. Pool ok but not great, when we went it was quite busy with children. Central and lots of food places nearby! 
Room large and spacious huge bed, good shower. Quite cold in the room.",4,2017,01,03
248,Perfect for a weekend city break ,"The location of the Camden Court Hotel couldn't be any better, just around the corner from the main clubs and bars in Dublin City (perfect for younger couples) and only a 5min walk from Grafton Street and St. Stephens Green. The staff were very friendly though I was waiting over an hour for a small sewing kit to be brought up to our room, had to ring the front desk a couple times before I finally received it. The breakfast was lovely, lots to choose from including a fry and cereal and fruit. Rooms very clean and beds extremely comfy. There is parking at the hotel at a cost of €10 per night for guests, which is a little much to ask for considering the rooms aren't exactly cheap. There's also an on site pool and leisure centre to enjoy. Overall a lovely hotel and I would highly recommend for young and older couples as well as families.",4,2017,01,02
248,Really good food but wifi is a desaster,The hotel is located pretty much at e center of Dublin. You have to walk for about half an hour to temple bar. The hotel is clean and the staff is very friendly. The restaurant is very good but also expensive. One breakfast costs sixteen euros. Everything else is ok for the price except the free wifi ....thats just a total disaster. Most of the time it doesn't work and if it is working it is so slow that you cant really use it. So if you need internet in the hotel for whatever reason then look for another hotel. ,3,2017,01,01
248,Perfect location ,Having an office on Harcourt Street the Camden Court is a perfect location for stay over . The staff are friendly and helpful from reception through to Bar staff . The hotel itself is quiet and with all services in a room for business traveler i look forward to next trip to our Dublin office and staying here . The hotel is also close enough for people to walk towards the green or grafton street at night for dinners if they so wish ,5,2016,12,19
248,Nice hotel to reasonable price,"We stayed three nights at Camden Court hotel in dec 2016. It was a nice hotel, the bus (757) from the airport stopped just opposite the hotel, It was the end stop also, so  no need to worry about getting off at the right stop. There were some conferences, weddings and other activities going on and in the foyer it was from time to time quite noisy. But the room was quit, despite the fact it faces a main street with lots of traffic. Especially in Saturday night between 3 and 5 am it was fascinating watching all drunken people going home and trying to catch a cab. The room was big enough, the beds were comfortable and they were clean and nice. We hade no breakfast but I tried it once at it was definitely not worth the money, they charged too much.",4,2016,12,19
248,Good location with festive cheer,"Revisted at the start of December and was nice to see the hotel with lots of Christmas cheers. Lobby and bar areas were nicely decorated. Disappointed that the pool was closed for renovations on this visit. 

Hotel facilities are as expected for a business hotel, however the wifi is fiddly to log into and painfully slow during the evening when guests are using it. ",3,2016,12,19
248,Worst Wifi,"It really is a nice business type hotel. Standard fare really with a decent breakfast. The rooms are well appointed, fairly small rooms with hard bed but comfortable and quiet. The huge issue I have is wifi. Just the worst. I lost connection at last 30 times during a one night business visit so I got very little work done which was the whole point of my stay in Dublin. Very disappointing and in fact the only reason not to stay again......which I won't.",3,2016,12,17
248,4 DAYS 3 NIGHTS,"Possibly the most help full check in desk staff I have ever find. Nothing is too much trouble for them. Let them know if you are visiting an attraction. They will help. The hotel is spacious, clean rooms, and well placed. Every manner of restraints almost within a stone's throw. Not far from the airport buses. All in all if your in Dublin, this is a fine hotel.",5,2016,12,17
248,Two night business stay,"Stayed here two nights on business trip. Very central location and lovely lobby.  The room I had was to the back and quiet. The decor is tired and walls are very marked. I found the pillows too high to sleep on. The WiFi is weak. I just stayed using my own data as the WiFi was a waste of time. Breakfast was fine. Staff aren't very attentive. Had to look for someone each morning to order tea. My colleagues rooms were to the front of the hotel so they didn't get much sleep due to the street noise and early morning deliveries. My stay was fine.. just maybe expected more when greeted by such a nice lobby etc. Again,  very central location. Close to good pubs and restaurants. ",3,2016,12,14
248,Christmas trip,"Went to Dublin to visit the Christmas markets. The Camden hotel was a perfect place to stay. A few minutes walk to St Stephens Green and you are right there at Grafton Street. The welcome at the hotel was lovely, big bright reception. Check in took just minutes, as did check out. The food in the bistro was lovely. And the waitress Ciara was wonderful. So helpful and friendly. Had a taste of the new gin ungava, the manager Tony Sargent suggested I try the tonic with elderflower. It was delicious.. so if you are in the neighborhood pop in for a taste. You will find Tony and all the staff great hosts. They made our 2 night stay wonderful 😁",5,2016,12,11
248,Lovely hotel central to town.,"Stayed on business, nice location, comfortable room and would stay again. Breakfast has a good choice and their bacon loin carvery is the best I've ever tasted. Didn't have dinner here but if breakfast is the standard would only imagine it would be good too.",4,2016,12,08
248,Festive Friday With Good Customer Care.,"Four of us attened The Camden Court Christmas Party Night on Friday the 2nd of December 2016. We had a prosecco reception on arrivel at 7.15 pm served to us by a lovely girl called Laura, dinner was called for 7.45pm. The menu had a choice of four starters, four main and three desserts. We all went for the duck starter and three of us went for the roast rib beef with pepper sauce on the side which was beautiful. In between courses there was entertainment with dancers and singers. After the meal the Dj played till 1.00am. We all had a lovely night, the first to start the Christmas Party season. The staff in the Camden Court played a big part in makeing the night so enjoyable for every one, from making the booking Sinead Brennan was so helpful and efficient , on the night Sandra phoned me as she had not seen us come in and wanted  to check every thing was alright, the service staff where very pleasent, good humoured and efficient. A good team with good customer service. Cost for dinner and entertainment €59 per person.
B.C",5,2016,12,04
248,Dublin Leisure Weekend,Four of us stayed here for 2 nights - a ladies weekend. Rooms were comfortable although a little too warm. We had 2 twin rooms looking out onto Camden Street. A bit noisy the second night but nothing too bad. Rooms comfortable. Breakfast very good and served to you. Hot and a good range of food. We didn't eat in the hotel in the evening but there is a restaurant. There is a good foyer with plenty of seats. There is also a pool and leisure facilities which we did not use. The hotel is about 20 minutes walk from the Grafton Street area and there is close access to the Luas and to buses. ,4,2016,11,28
248,Friday night in town ,Stayed in this hotel as was having dinner local and wanted to make a night of it. Must say rooms were very clean & modern with just enough space. Selected the room only rate but opted for room service breakfast. €35 for breakfast to room is a tad expensive even though it was very nice. Only negative was the wifi which was poor speed but not a massive issue for me. Fantastically located within walking distance of most locations on south side.  Room only rate very reasonable priced. ,4,2016,11,26
248,Good location and wonderful breakfast,"We just finished a four night stay at the Camden Court Hotel.   Liked the location quite a bit (about 10 min walk to Grafton Street, St. Stephens Green and 15 min walk to Trinity college).   Also next to a great traditional pub, The Bleeding Horse.   Breakfasts were delicious and there was so much variety to choose from, although I admit that I mostly stuck to the full Irish breakfast with extra brown soda bread.   My only complaint is that the WiFi was incredibly weak and we couldn't even load most sites on our lap top, like for flight check in, etc.",4,2016,11,25
248,Redeemed ,"After writing a not so good review I got a response from hotel offering sincere apologies and an opportunity to restore my faith in their hotel.. I decided to take  them up on this offer and I have to say I was not disappointed we were so well looked after room was perfect and staff were brilliant especially Shanice Carey who went above and beyond her duties to make sure my family stay was a good one.... I would highly recommend this hotel I was obviously just unlucky the first time..will definitely be back.. 
Thanks Caroline ",5,2016,11,24
248,"Well appointed, central hotel","Had a brief one-night stay.  Hotel is quite centrally located - about 10 minutes south of Stephen's Green and in the epicentre of non-Temple Bar nightlife, yet at the same time, quiet.  Check-in/out were both efficient and friendly.  The rooms are clean, comfortable, warm and exactly like the pictures on the website.  The foyer is cosy with armchairs and sofas where you can relax for a snack and a drink.  Unusually for a city centre hotel, there's a leisure centre, which I didn't have time to use, and ample parking.  The pub next door also looked as if it were worth visiting. I'd definitely stay again.",4,2016,11,21
248,Staff and room,"Hi, beginning of november I stayed at your hotel from thursday to sunday with my husband but we were a part of a large group staying at your hotel.
Upon check-in I did a quick inspection (work in the hotel industry) of the room and found the bathroom being quite dirty (hairs in bathtub, toothpaste splatters on inside of door, bloodstains on wall). I took pictures and immediately went down to reception where I was asked to wait for a manager. The manager (young man, eastern european accent) asked if he could send housekeeping upstairs to make sure that my complaints were in fact valid (those were not his exact words but indeed implied by him). I went upstairs and a few minutes later housekeeping supervisor came into the bathroom and f.ex. said that the stains on the wall were make up stains, not blood. A housekeeper (young lady) was with her and the supervisor left her to clean the bathroom and the young woman apologised for the inconvenience. No compensation was made and the attitude of both the FOM and Housekeeping supervisor was not very nice. On friday afternoon after we returned back to the room, the bed had been made but no bathmat or washcloths were in the room. Towels were also changed despite us having placed them on the hooks and not wanting them to be changed. Location of hairdryer is also quite bizarre (desk drawer) as nothing suggests that you should look there and we heard that comment from several people from the group we were travelling with. 
Several times we went to the reception to ask for information such as opening hours of shops and got wrong information as well as very mixed information depending on whom we spoke to. It seemed to me that the staff wasn't very knowledgable about the city.
The best staff member we across was the young man (piccalo) who did assist us on sunday when most of us had our luggage in storage. He not only waited for many of us while we prepared our cases, but also moved things, turned on lights, offered to take trash to recycling etc. 
The location of the hotel is nice and I absolutely loved the restaurant just across the street (in which you can bring your own alcohol)! I will definitely visit Dublin again but will look for another accommodation.",3,2016,11,21
248,Great location ,A city where everyone walks and proximity to the tram station is what matters. Very friendly staff and spas opus rooms are the highlight. Just felt the breakfast could be better organised when they had a group and the fact that no newspaper in the room made it a bit inconvenient. ,4,2016,11,19
248,Location Location Location,"Due to the busy convention season in September, we had to split up our stay in Dublin at 3 different hotels: The Leeson Inn, the Harcourt Hotel and the Camden Court Hotel. They are all located in downtown Dublin within walking distance to amenities. However, there is a huge different in pricing. Camden Court turns out to be the most expensive, and Leeson Inn is fit for a budget traveler. All 3 hotels have excellent staff and clean rooms. Leeson Inn is smaller and a bit old style and dark, no elevator. They serve only continental breakfast. Harcourt is right by a tram track. The taxi driver had to drop us across the street. Oh, yes, another interesting thing - when the tram stops running near midnight - the entire street is filled with rowdy crowds dancing and shouting to blasting loud music. With the Hotel running its own nightclub simultaneously, it's painful if you just want to catch up with some sleep.  Camden Court has a nice size gym and swimming pool with hot tub.They also serve one of the most spectacular breakfast buffet!  What I like best? the Airport Bus 757 is right across the street from Camden Court Hotel. It comes every 15-20 minutes and it only costs 6 euro. It's the first time I rode on a double decker bus since my childhood!",5,2016,11,18
248,Good central hotel,"Good access to public transport and within walking distance of the centre of the city.
Clean rooms, but limited on facilities normally found in hotels of similar price range in other cities.

Strangely there were conference rooms on the same floor (2nd) which meant that there were a lot of people moving around the corridors in the morning.",3,2016,11,16
248,A family weekend celebration,"Really enjoyed this hotel. A group of us had travelled to Dublin to celebrate a family members birthday. As the party was being held in the hotel we decided to book in for two nights. Its a well appointed hotel with pleasant rooms and a comfortable bed. The food at the celebration was first class, we had a sit down meal with a choice of mains , which was a nice surprise.
The main bistro bar was reasonably priced for Dublin and had plenty of sport channels showing the football and rugby all weekend. Staff  that we came into contact with were great throughout all the hotel departments.
The only thing I  could say I was disappointed with was the cooked breakfast, as much of the food on the buffet was mostly overcooked and dried out as though it had been left out too long.
The location is good as well, either a 15 minute walk to Grafton St shopping area , or one stop on the tram line to St Stephens Green",5,2016,11,16
248,"Nice hotel, location not so central maybe","Stayed here for business. Location wise maybe not in the city centre where most turist want to stay. But close enough. Near a lot of businesses, so hence why I am here. 4 star hotel. Rooms are nice, but limited. No AC, no mini bar, only coffee/tea and iron in rooms. Vending machines for sodas on each floor. I think there is a small cafe/kiosk onsite where you can get some small things. OK TV selection but not the best. Ask for a FAN from the reception if you want some air. Windows can be opened but noisy outside so be aware. Good food both from room service and an OK selection from the breakfast menu. Polite staff, clean hotel. I hear they have a SPA and pool, but I have not used them my self. Overall a good stay and good hotel.",3,2016,11,15
248,Very good hotel,Camden Court is a very comfortable modern hotel in a good location. Rooms are clean and comfortable and we found the buffet breakfast better than most hotels. Unfortunately we feel the bar is not very pleasant or welcoming ( the design and decor... not the staff ) . We would certainly recommend staying here and we look forward to going back again.,5,2016,11,15
248,Cozy hotel,"Relaxing rooms, very friendly staff. Good location. Breakfast could be better... You cannot serve / help yourself! Can only be done by a rather unfriendly cook. Internet can be slow at times. Otherwise an excellent stay.",5,2016,11,13
248,Nice Hotel,"Very clean, well decorated hotel in a convenient location. Everything was as it should be and was clean. It was quite pleasant and a nice change of pace from most of the other hotels I stayed in during a tour.",4,2016,11,10
248,Great hotel and location,"Good location,plenty of shops and restaurants nearby. 
Nice pool and spa facilties.rooms large , clean and comfortable.  Staff all very helpful,  nice bar and longe area. Good quality and choice at breakfast.",5,2016,11,09
248,A let down,"It was an enjoyable weekend with our friends and we thought our things were safe. Wouldn't had been so relaxed with somebody cleaning my room if I would have known that things could simply disappear..

Left my Bose sound link and one fitbit charger in the room as we checked out. Hours later we came back to the hotel as we realised we forgot it in the room. However they say that nothing was left in the room, we thought that we had made a mistake and would find the stuff in our bag as we would unpack when we would be back home.

Nope, nothing in our bag so we contacted them again and still they will not acknowledge that this was left in the room. 

Disappointing..",1,2016,11,09
248,Great stay ,"Hotel is fantastic. Room was of high standard, spacious and very clean. Staff were lovely! Location is also good only ten minute walk from main shopping street and there is a plenty of pubs and clubs around the hotel. 5/5 would definitely return!! ",5,2016,11,06
248,Easy to get to hotel in downtown,"I found out the hard way that Dublin lodging is not cheap, so if you want a decent hotel you won't go wrong staying at the Camden Court.  You can take a shuttle bus directly to the hotel for a fair price and then you are in a great location where you can walk to a lot of stuff so no rental car is needed.  The room was very comfortable and even if breakfast is not included I recommend it as they serve a traditional Irish breakfast - why go out when they have a great one right in your lobby!  I hope to stay here again when I make it back to Dublin.",4,2016,11,06
248,"Good hotel, not too far from the city centre","Camden Court Hotel is good for both tourists and business travellers. It is modern, but stylish and cosy. Rooms are good. Staff is very friendly. They have a great breakfast and a good restaurant too. Next to the hotel is a great pub, you should not miss, the Bleeding Horse. 
There are several affordable restaurants in the neigbourhood.",4,2016,11,05
248,Slayed,"Stayed here in July for the Beyonce Concert and I didn't know where I was going to be staying as it was my Mum who booked this but when I got there I was really impressed.. So big thanks to her!!  Lovely Hotel.. so trending and I was gutted that I couldn't of stayed longer than I did.. room was lovely the bed was nice and big, very comfy and decor was really nice.. The breakfast was lovely and I really enjoyed it.. Friendly staff and in a great location will defo be back here..:)",5,2016,11,04
248,Charming & clean!!,"One of my favorites....the staff are wonderful and very obliging, especially for large coach tours.....the location is good, just a couple of blocks from Grafton Street.   The bar is lively and I love the reception area.....great for people watching !!!",5,2016,11,03
248,Best service and comfortable.,"4 nights at camden court hotel was very relaxing and the staff was very professional,Food was great so was the atmohsphere stay with friends who are very happy as me.Deffinetly going to go there a again.",4,2016,11,01
248,Excellent Location. Very comfortable hotel ,My boyfriend and I stayed here while attending a concert in Dublin and we really enjoyed our stay. The room were furnished beautifully and the breakfast the next morning was delicious. Within walking distance of St Stephens Green and Grafton Street. Staff very friendly and accommodating; allowed us to print off our concert tickets etc. Would definitely return!  ,5,2016,11,01
248,Wonderful location and services,Everything about this Hotel was great.  The location was within walking distance to many of the Dublin sights...  the rooms were lovely and comfortable.  The full breakfast was outstanding and everyone I came in contact with was very helpful with anything we asked.,5,2016,10,31
248,Comfortable stay!,"Very nice convenient place to stay in Dublin.  Front staff Louis and Georgi were so helpful and friendly during our stay.  The Hotel has a large lobby with comfortable seating in group settings where we entertained family & friends visiting us with pleasant wait staff to order drinks.  Busy location and we needed to be careful crossing streets but the hotel is within walking distance to many Dublin attractions.  Room was very clean, bed comfortable, large flat screen T.V. but very limited stations.  We enjoyed the breakfast buffet with many hot and cold choices.  We asked for a quiet area room.",4,2016,10,31
248,Excellent value and very pleasant.,"Stayed for two nights on what was primarily a business trip. 
 
My reservation was very courteously handled by Magda, and although unfortunately the hotel was full for the total period I wanted, she offered to waitlist me.

The front area is busy, as there always seem to be groups coming and going, but the overall impression is calm.

The hotel is well situated, a few minutes from St. Stephens Green, LUAS, and buses, the only drawback being a longish walk (20 minutes) to the nearest DART/Railway station (Pearse or Grand Canal Quay.). Airport 757 bus stop is outside the hotel.  It's not in the best area, very rowdy on a Friday night, but I didn't feel unsafe, and the hotel itself is quiet.

The hotel is 'classic' and very comfortable and well-appointed.  Very helpful and knowledgeable front-of-house staff, Georgi in particular whom I dealt with, although I am sure they are all of the same high standard.  The room I had was quiet, a decent size, comfortable and spotlessly clean.  Wifi was a bit slow.  The bathroom stuff is Orla Kiely which apparently is an upmarket Irish designer brand, a nice touch.

Breakfast was as good as a buffet can be, with quality and freshly cooked ingredients, although the bacon could be improved on, as it was greasy and not crispy.  A superb offer of fruits, different breads and pastries, and cereals was on offer. The gentleman on duty almost insisted that I had more than just one sausage and one egg, so I was surprised to see other remarks about the offer being 'stingy'.  I enjoyed my breakfast.

The company I contract for has a corporate rate, but even at the standard rate, I would happily use this hotel for future private stays at my own expense, given that finding a decent hotel in Dublin for a reasonable rate is far from easy. 

Excellent sleep quality. I had great difficulty separating my body from the very comfortable bed in the mornings!",4,2016,10,30
248,Enjoyable week-end break,We go to Dublin for the week-end once or twice a year. This was our first stay in Camden Court and it was just lovely. The staff were excellent and it is so nice to have a bathroom with the choice of bath or shower - toiletries were a delight 😊! Choice of breakfast was really good and after shopping we spent Sunday afternoon in the bar over a few glasses of very nice wine - staff here were excellent too. We will definitely be back.,5,2016,10,30
248,Good base for exploring the city,"We stayed at this hotel for a couple of days and found it really handy.
We landed at Dublin airport walked outside and got straight onto a 757 bus which dropped us off outside the hotel - marvellous! So easy to get to.
After that we walked everywhere - it took about 7- 10 minutes to walk to Grafton St, and St Stephens Square so we never needed to even use any transport for the rest of the stay and this was the main advantage of this hotel.
The room ( a twin) was comfortable as were the beds and had everything we needed including tea and coffee making. The shower was good and the whole room was extremely clean.
Breakfast too was very good - no complaints at all. The staff on reception were extremely helpful. Would stay here again.",4,2016,10,28
248,"Nice hotel, but not if you want to stay connected","Very nice hotel, centrally located - very close to the Luas line and within walking distance of a lot of great restaurants. Room was very comfortable - walls a little thin (you'll hear any loud conversations next door). 
Biggest drawback for us was lack of WiFi in the hotel - they offer it, but it rarely worked during the week we stayed there. It did not work in our room, and worked VERY slowly in the hotel lobby.",3,2016,10,27
248,Lovely Hotel quite expensive,"Rooms are fantastic! lovely comfy bed and plenty of room. The bath is very shallow so you cant really have a soak, its more for showers. We stayed here last weekend for my sis in laws 50th and there were 12 of us. We booked a deal with a meal included on one night. The food was very good. I chose steak (which was 5 euros extra) it came with a pile of huge chunky cut chips which were a bit hard. The steak wasn't brilliant quite chewy but not wanting to be the only one complaining I just got on with it. Id avoid the steak if you have the meal its not worth the extra dosh. The staff were all lovely and we thouroughly enjoyed our stay and would recommend it to others.",4,2016,10,26
248,Fantastic hotel ,"I've stayed in lots of hotels in Dublin and this is one of the best!  Lovely rooms and the staff are so professional and helpful.  I had a small issue and within a minute the hotel manager was with me and had a solution!

Very impressed 

Will be back soon

Thanks again

248,Nice hotel w friendly staff,"We stayed for three nights, got a nice quiet room. We used the spa which was great after days of much walking. All in all a very pleasant stay. No mini fridge or hair dryer in the room. Comfy beds and clean.",4,2016,10,25
248,Weekend stay,"We stayed two nights and the first night was fine apart from the pillows they seemed massive . 
On the second night we were woke very early in the morning by workers working in the room next to us they were hammering at the tiles to remove them I later found out . this was constant. From a early hour until we checked out . so don't expect a good lie in if booking here . very disappointing for a expensive stay in what seemed like a decent hotel ",2,2016,10,24
248,Overpriced for what's provided!!! ,€85 per person in a treble room..room only! No wifi working at all. Second bed was a pullout sofa bed...bars of which are seen in the photos! Got free breakfast offered when I complained which appeased us somewhat..but then they ruined  it when I was checking out by informing me it was €10 for the carpark! Ridiculous! It'll be a desperate day if I ever stay here again! ,2,2016,10,23
248,Camden Stay,"We spent  3 nights here and had a most enjoyable time.  Centerally located, close to transit and many good restaurant s  and pubs.  Desk crew were very helpful and patient, especially James on reception. I look forward to returning",5,2016,10,22
248,"Great location, friendly staff","Stayed here on the first and last night of a group tour. First room was larger than the second but both were very comfortable and very quiet at night (after midnight). Breakfast lines can get long when multiple tour groups are present (can't imagine what it's like during the high season in summer) but food was good and a nice variety. Great location, 10-15 min walk to the main shopping street (Grafton) and points in city center. Staff recommended an excellent steak restaurant (F.X. Buckley)! Overall a very nice hotel that I would stay at again when in Dublin.",5,2016,10,21
248,Central location,"I have stayed in this hotel on a number of occasions, I recently spent one night in the Camden Court, during a visit to Dublin, when I arrived my room was not ready, so I was offered a nice cup of tea, which I thought was on the house but as I checked out it was added on to the bill.
The bed room was located on the sixth floor and was small but of a good standard. The room was clean, but forget about city views, your are simply looking at offices. For a busy hotel it was quiet at night and I had a reasonable nights sleep.
Breakfast is the normal hotel buffet style, which was fine, but they control the portion sizes almost to the point were the staff seem to count the mushrooms. You need to be like Oliver Twist and ask for more. I also find buffet style breakfasts to be a bit dried out as it sits in the hot plates and could have been cooked a couple of hours before service
Front of house staff were friendly, breakfast staff were attentive they did offer fresh tea, but they clear your plate a little to quick and seem keen to get you on your way as soon as possible after you have finished your breakfast.
The location is good and quite central, but the Camden Court like most hotels in Dublin is getting a bit to expensive.",4,2016,10,20
248,Good hotel,"Just back from family trip. Stayed in family room. Room was clean and comfortable. Staff on reception v friendly and helpful. Kate in the leisure centre was very friendly good humoured and helpful. Made coffee for my wife (without being asked) while I was in pool with kids. Overall great location, good breakfast, nice clean room and friendly staff. Will definitely stay again. It's only a few mins walk from Stephens green so very central. Lucas is just outside hotel also which made it easy to travel to dundrum.",4,2016,10,16
248,Nice and simple.,"We stayed 7 nights at this hotel. Excellent location. It's very pleasant and very clean. They offer great service. The restaurants are nice and the food is good (not fantastic, but good). We thought that the continental breakfast was a great value since most of the restaurants does no offer refills for your coffee. The food selection was good. Unfortunately our room faced the back parking lot and we could hear lots of noise throughout the night (specially trucks picking up garbage) and because there was no AC we had to leave the window opened. Besides that, we enjoyed our staying.",4,2016,10,16
248,Top Notch Location in City Centre,The staff and accommodations at Camden Court were excellent.  Many staff went out of their way to insure we could get to the destinations we desired...even lending us umbrellas for the walk to Guinness St. James Brewery!,5,2016,10,15
248,End of Irish trip,"Nice hotel with good location.  Comfy king size bed.  No a/c and can be noisy with window open.  We faced the area where cars and taxis pulled in and late night reveled could be loud.  For some reason there was always bottles being emptied in trash in wee hours of am.  

Breakfast was best at any of our hotels in Ireland.  Staff courteous and friendly.",4,2016,10,14
248,Great location,"Stayed here for one night on business last year and have booked again for this year. Very central location so able to enjoy some of the city at night. Although central it was not noisy. Excellent breakfast, rooms clean and comfortable, good pool and jacuzzi. Staff are friendly and helpful. Would recommend and would definitely stay for longer if I had the opportunity.",5,2016,10,11
248,Nice break,"The hotel itself was lovely however it was a little far out from the city centre. We didn't  mind the walk however we would have preferred ideally to be a little bit closer. On arrival at the hotel we found a small box of chocolates (2 chocolates inside) and a welcome card handwritten with a message to us directly inside which was very nice, a personal touch. It would have been nice for a few more chocolates though :P beds were comfy, rooms were modern and very clean. The only negatives we have regarding the hotel mainly refer to the wifi, it is very slow and almost impossible to connect to. Smart TVs are provided however you just receive an error message continuously saying ""device not connected to the internet"" which is not very useful. The rooms also let in a lot of noice in the mornings making it hard to have a lay in. Other than this we had a lovely stay at Camden court, we used the pool and other leisure facilities which were lovely. The room service was pricey however 100% worth it. I would highly recommend. ",4,2016,10,11
248,Excellent choice.,"Booked via Virgin Vacations in a package self-guided tour to Ireland, Scotland and England. 

We had planned to use Dublin Bus Tours  ( www.dublinsightseeing.ie ) to go to and from the airport; they have a combo ticket with a hop-on/hop-off addition that has other perks as well. The clincher was that the bus stops at the corner where the Camden Court Hotel is located, so it was a no-brainer. Unfortunately, the bus service union called a strike the day we arrived, so it was taxi service instead. Hopefully you can benefit from my research. 

This would be considered a three to four star hotel in any country in the world. 

The setting is along Camden Street, a main thoroughfare in a very hip and young area of Dublin. There are restaurants and shops galore in the area on the way to and from the center of town. It is active and lively, but then that is wonderful Dublin in a nutshell. There will be noise on the street until the wee hours Friday through Sunday, so request a quiet room if you need one, run a fan or just stay out all night. 

If you desire a quiet street walk to town, I recommend turning to the right as you exit the hotel, go to make a left onto Harcourt Street and enjoy Iveagh Park and St. Stephen's Green. This route takes you to Grafton Street, Dublin's diminutive version of Fifth Avenue in New York (a pedestrian mall) then to Trinity College and beyond to the River Liffey.

Oh, yes, the hotel. 

Staff is excellent; just truly professional. Just be polite and they will make you feel like royalty.

The rooms are huge by continental or London standards. Clean, well appointed with all the conveniences. Comfy beds. Request a fan as there is no room adjusted air-conditioning. The windows open! Just lovely.

Hotel lobby is beautiful with large congregation areas and seating. There is a secured room with a computer, printer, and fax machine for communications as needed (worked flawlessly) and free wifi throughout the hotel. There is a very well equipped and staffed fitness center and pool available free to guests. 

The Iveagh Restaurant within the hotel serves a full buffet breakfast with waited coffee and tea service. Bountiful; delicious. Self serve espresso drinks! Breakfast daily was included in our package. A light snack at lunch and a restaurant dinner and Bob's your uncle! A wonderful pub forms the front of the hotel, ""The Bleeding Horse"" (unfortunate name, in my opinion). Sunday night they have a traditional Irish music program with local talent, really the heart of Ireland. 

Enjoy.",5,2016,10,08
248,Nice hotel,Camden court hotel is located about 10-15 minutes walk away from Dublin center. It was modern nice hotel with nice room and good wifi. Breakfast was plentiful and it had nice pub Bleeding Horse right next to it.  Wifi worked effortlesly and they had nice Orla Kiely toiletries. Those were nice touch. Nothing bad to say.,4,2016,10,08
248,Irish Hospitality evident at Camden Court,"Very helpful staff...we were able to check in early.  Beautiful lobby with bar service in the lobby or the bar.  Breakfast was good with multiple choices for everyone.  A good place to try foods like white and black pudding for the first time! The rooms were nice. We were there in October, so the weather was cool--nice enough to open windows (there is no air conditioning); however, the street noise made it impossible to sleep with the windows open.  The location is good for getting around town--within walking distance to St. Stephen's Green and our Dublin Bus Hop-on-Hop off stop.",4,2016,10,07
248,Corporate party of 24 staying for conference,"Large, comfortable hotel located in fairy hip part of town. The hotel ticked all the necessary corporate boxes, efficiently run, comfortable rooms, the technology all worked properly and all the staff seemed to know what they were doing and were very helpful. We would be happy to return. ",4,2016,10,07
248,All-round good hotel,"Our first stop in Ireland, Camden Court began our good experience with Irish hospitality. The staff was friendly and helpful; the rooms, large and clean.
     We arrived at 11 a.m. but the staff had duly noted my email request for an early check-in and quiet room. We were promptly checked in and on our way to a room way in the far back of the hotel. That's when we realized this is a very large hotel that caters to business conferences and tour groups. Even so, most of the time we didn't feel surrounded by crowds. It was only only on the last morning that we had to scramble, trying to squeeze too many people and luggage into very crowded elevators. 
     The hotel is in central Dublin, and although it's not a super long walk to St. Stephen's Green (and we like to walk), we have to say it got tiring/boring walking it as often as we did (2-3 times a day for three days) to get to the key sites, even when we took different routes. So although it's ""convenient,"" there may be other hotels closer to the action if that's an important criterion.
     We did not eat breakfast at the hotel since it was 16 Euros per person extra for us (since we weren't part of a group). But there are plenty of choices nearby to grab a quick bite. 
     Minor complaint: we found our Internet painfully slow, almost like dial-up.",4,2016,10,06
248,Good Hotel,"This hotel is well located within the city and it is possible to walk to the city centre. The hotel is clean, staff are very helpful and friendly and overall is very comfortable. It is a busy hotel in a busy part of the city, so I wouldn't call it relaxing but then you probably wouldn't go to a city hotel if you wanted relaxation. The bar serves the most fantastic steak sandwich served on focaccia bread...it was amazing and the drink selection was good too.",4,2016,10,04
248,Large hotel ...easy to walk to tourist attractions,"Lovely lobby, more than enough breakfast choices and there is a bar if your travels require a pint to end the day. 
The location of this hotel was a few long blocks from St Stephens Green and Grafton Street. However, it was not a terribly long walk! We even walked to St Patrick's and the Guinness Storehouse but let it be known, we love to walk and the busses are just too slow for us and cabs too $$$!
Bedroom and bath adequate to meet anyone's needs. They even offered facecloths!  Staff responsive to all needs including many map questions. We stayed 4 nights and was not disappointed. ",4,2016,09,30
248,Great location in central Dublin which also boasts a basement swimming pool.,it has been quite a while since I last stayed at the Camden Court so it was interesting to see what had changed and what had stayed the same. The  decor has been refreshed but the lifts are still painfully slow. Lunch is served very efficiently in the main dining room. Staff are very friendly and helpful. Good location for meetings and hosting corporate events.,4,2016,09,28
248,Hotel to a good standard great location for Dublin City vist ,"Stayed in Camden Court for 2 nights for work. staff are friendly, breakfast was to  a good standard  and it's in a really good location - central to city centre and close to attractions . I found wifi worked very well in the room  Overall, a good hotel with good facilities and I would stay again without hesitation.
Thanks for a good experience.",4,2016,09,27
248,Cleaning staff could do with some lessons,"Let me start off by saying this was the best breakfast in Ireland. Having said that, for the price of the hotel, I think that they could have done a better job in several areas. The cleaning staff was negligent. Several days they did not refill anything and left us without soap and other amenities. Had to get towels off of the cart. While the room had instant coffee and tea, we were charged for  bags of herbal tea. The room was exceedingly hot and not well ventilated. Unfortunately our room, although three floors up, was subject to lots of loud noise from tourist and much smoke in the middle of the night. To be fair, once we complained, the noise did quiet down some. Would probably not stay here again for the price of €200/night. ",3,2016,09,25
248,A pleasant business stay,"Stayed just one night for a business conference in the hotel. The room was newly     refurbished, clean, comfortable and quiet - all one needs really. Breakfast was good but the dining room crowded and only one coffee machine working. Conference facilities were excellent with a lovely room and a satisfying lunch. All in all, a winner on every front.",4,2016,09,25
248,Very comfortable hotel centrally located,"We arrived in mid-morning and were given a room right away. The room was comfortable and well-appointed overlooking the courtyard.  While the mattress was comfortable the pillows were more than a little firm. 
We would recommend this hotel for amenities, restaurant and proximity to attractions.",4,2016,09,24
248,Lovely Hotel,"Arrived early afternoon and found check in quick and easy. The gentleman on reception was very friendly. Lovely reception area, very spacious. 

Room was big also spacious with a big smart tv. Clean bathroom with the obligatory toiletries. Did seem as though the room was from a premier Inn though. 

Close to St Stephens Green, about 10 min walk to temple bar. A bit further for the guiness factory, but really worth a visit. 

All in all a great stay and well  recommended. ",4,2016,09,23
248,Good location,"Stayed in Camden Court a few times for work. staff are friendly, breakfast contains a good selection and it's in a really good location - central to city centre and under 10 euros in taxi from connolly train station. The only down sides were I found wifi wouldn't work very well in the room and each morning the key card wouldn't let me back into the room after breakfast - the staff did fix this each time but it is annoying. Overall, a good hotel for the price.",4,2016,09,22
248,Just okay ,"I gave this hotel a 3 because it was clean and had all the necessities. But the twin bed I was given was very hard, the reception staff were professional but not not super knowledgable. And the location is not great for sightseeing. If you have other choices I wouldn't pick this one. It's nothing special for what they charge. ",3,2016,09,21
248,Pretty Much Perfect,"Stayed here for Business at the start of September, perfect hotel for what I needed, swimming pool & gym are great, restaurant food is really nice and the location of the hotel is perfect.

Beds are comfy, Netflix on the tv so just sign in and you can pick up your series where you left off.

Will be in and out of Dublin a lot for Business over the next couple of months and will certainly stay here again.",5,2016,09,19
248,Expensive,"For the price of this hotel, there were disappointing features:
The Reception staff were unfriendly. 
The wifi did not work. 
The room was small, overlooking carpark. 
Some positive features:
The room was clean. 
The shower was good. 
The bar staff (2 brothers) were friendly. ",2,2016,09,17
248,Cheap but you get what you pay for,"We stayed here thinking it was close to St Stephens Green... it was somewhat close but still we had to walk 10 minutes which normally would be fine but is actually really annoying in a country that rains every day! Its not hard to find St Stephens though, its just a simple right, left then keep walking straight. 

The room was nice and clean but the pillow was rock hard and gave me a neck ache. We asked for a softer pillow which they did have available so if you're staying here make sure you ask for one.

We had a continental breakfast and it was standard... nothing to be excited over but convenient if you're hungry and dont want to walk to a cafe. 

The most convenient part of the hotel is that there is a bus to the airport just across the road making access a breeze. 

I'd stay again if my usual hotel in St Stephens Green was overpriced, but only in that instance.",3,2016,09,12
248,Not what it used to be.,"As above not what it used to be unfortunately. Great location and food, but rooms look tired and some of the bar staff do not behave as you would expect, Antonio was very pleasant, but he was the exception along with front of house staff they are professional. Sorry will I visit again yes and no maybe?",3,2016,09,12
248,Good hotel.,"The hotel is 10 minutes walk from the center.Sufficient characteristics required for 4 star.Room conditions in the average level. The biggest plus for breakfast. Booking also seemed to 200 Euros for 2 people. You stay in hotel in Turkey, including everything extraordinary that money. But this is normal for Ireland. You may be more appropriate by calling the hotel directly.",4,2016,09,11
248,"OK, but hot and noisy","Good location, but there is no ventilation in the rooms other than a window, and it was noisy outside. So it was hot or noisy.
The double bed was actually two singles covered in 2 pads and one sheet, plus a cover wrapped in a sheet, so it was warm regardless.
The breakfast was OK, a little greasy.",3,2016,09,11
248,Very pleasant stay,"This hotel is a short 10-15 minute walk from the city center. It is very clean and well kept. The rooms are spacious and very tidy. The staff was very helpful, our flight came in at 7am to Dublin, and they quickly cleaned up a room so that we could check in early. I would recommend this hotel to anyone. Good price and comfortable stay.",4,2016,09,09
248,Good but not more,"Good, central and clean hotel. Typical small of UK/I hotels but that may just be me. Staff is super friendly and beds are very comfortable. Room is clean. Just nothing special. Breakfast is mostly for people who like a fry up. ",3,2016,09,08
248,Family Football Vacation,"Did my due diligence and this hotel had a 4+ rating.  Never thought to ask about air conditioning which became an issue as the temperatures averaged High 80'sF during our stay.
Early morning construction noise in their courtyard was very annoying.
Desk staff often seemed put upon with minor requests e.g. calling a cab. They really need a concierge.
Overall very average and over rated.",3,2016,09,08
248,Shopping trip,This hotel was excellent and only a 15 min walk to Grafton St.My daughter and myself also treated ourselves to massages which proved to be a plus after shopping. That evening we asked Luka at reception for a recommendation for Italian food in the town.His recommendation was outstanding. Thank you Luka.,5,2016,09,07
248,Outstanding front desk staff,"We stayed five nights, as part of the Boston College/Georgia Tech football classic package. The staff were unbelievably accommodating and went out of their way to help us, in many different ways. James and Emma were extremely helpful, answering all of our questions, finding relevant tours, making recommendations, booking reservations, calling taxis, and even helping with cellphone technical issues. Monica in the restaurant was so sweet and even went so far as to get me some mint tea when she heard that I wasn't feeling well. Keith in the pub was so friendly and personable. Awesome location in terms of walking to almost all the sites we wanted to visit, restaurants, and shopping. The pool was longer than most hotels and nice to swim in. The room was fine and housekeeping was very good, but air conditioning would be helpful.",4,2016,09,06
248,Good location - no quiet rooms,"My husband & I recently stayed at this hotel. Since hotels in Ireland rarely have air conditioner, most people open their windows. There doesn't seem to be a quiet room in the place. Traffic on the streets and people talking & partying go on all night long.  I was able to request a fan which they promptly delivered to our room for some relief. The rooms are a little worn but clean. If using a taxi from this hotel, the service is very prompt. Asking front desk personnel for information on which buses to use & what times is not helpful as they don't seem to know. Possibly a summary of this information to the most popular tourist attractions would be helpful to other guests. ",3,2016,09,04
248,First Stop in Ireland,"We stayed two nights at the Camden.  Hotel was great!  Lots to do in the area.  Hotel staff very friendly and helpful.  Only ate breakfast at the hotel, very good.  If you have a room over the court yard it can get loud if you leave your window open.  Would recommend staying here.",5,2016,09,04
248,Does what it says on the tin,"Stayed for a couple of nights when flew in for a family celebration. First big advantage is that the 757 Airbus from the airport stops outside. 10 euro return is a bargain, and so convenient. Hotel was fine for purpose. Room was clean and well appointed. We had an iron and ironing board in the room, which was helpful. Also a safe for valuables. Bed was comfortable and very roomy. Bathroom was fine,though a little dated with a shower above the bath. Lots of mirrors gave a sense of space. We were lucky to get a room overlooking the entrance courtyard, which was quiet and allowed us to keep the window open for ventilation. Not sure if that would have worked with windows overlooking the busy street outside. Breakfast was extra, 12 euro if you booked in advance, but 16 on the day, but well worth it with a wide selection of hot and cold items. Staff were friendly and accommodating. We were able to leave our luggage after we booked out to pick up later to return to the airport. Very convenient for main shopping areas around Grafton Street. Good choice for us.",4,2016,09,03
248,Don't expect too much here,"This doesn't really feel like a 4 star hotel, it's a little dated and the interior of the rooms feels a little cheap. It's good enough though for a short stay. Rooms are spacious and beds comfy, free fast wifi and breakfast included. 
The whole place could do with a little renovation. There are only two lifts, so on the higher floors you spend a lot of time waiting for a lift. Gym is well equipped but really dated and could use some newer machines. Breakfast is OK, but also nothing special. Location is a little off the top attractions but walkable.",3,2016,09,02
248,It will suffice.,"For a price quality point of view its not bad at all. The walk to Stephens Green is about 5 minutes.  Breakfast was reasonable, only communication with reception and reservation did not go as planned. Asked for 1 double bed, I called and email to confirm my request but still they didn't deliver on check in. I attended reception staff to prior communications and showed emails confirming my request, yet still no change of bed on day 2 and day 3. 
Attended staff on blinking lights in room which drove me mad, it wasn't fixed until the third day. Cumbersome.",3,2016,09,02
248,Good hotel and nice location ,"This is a good hotel on the whole. Staff are friendly and the decor is of a decent standard. Rooms were a good size and had everything we needed. 

There were some issues. The cleaners didn't take away a tea tray nor the used water glasses in our room. We had to ask for replacements at the bar downstairs. There was no air con which meant the room was stuffy even with the window open. We asked for a fan which we had to chase up after a couple of hours when it didn't arrive. 

The lobby area is nice for a drink or coffee. The breakfast buffet was good, however it isn't really a buffet as there is a chef serving out (small) portions of hot food. While it didn't seem there was a limit on the hot food, it is off putting to have to ask if you want more of something. At €16 a head I'd expect to be able to get whatever I wanted without having to ask for it. There was a good selection of fruit, cereals, pastries, bread etc. The sausages were poor quality though and the toasters rubbish. Took three attempts to get any colour on the bread!

The location is good - lots of restaurants and bars nearby and there is a bus that goes direct to the airport in 30 minutes that stops outside the hotel entrance. It's a nice vibrant area which feels safe to walk around at night. 

Ultimately, the beds were comfy and the facilities good so can't complain. None of the niggles we experienced would put me off visiting again.  For a four star hotel the rooms were good value for central Dublin compared to other places we considered. ",4,2016,08,31
248,"Excellent accommodation, great food and very friendly staff!","We had a travel group that only stayed for two nights in Dublin near the financial district and the ""Harp Bridge"". The room was spacious, clean and more than comfortable. The lounge was very adequate with a great staff tending the bar. There were no complaints from me about the Camden Cort. The staff was very helpful in getting our airport transportation ironed out after our bus company ""forgot about us"" at 2 am in the morning (story for another time!). I would recommend the Camden Court in a heart beat!",5,2016,08,31
248,Central location and friendly staff,"I stayed at the Camden Court for 4 nights in August, I arrived early (11am) and it was no problem checking in early. Staff were friendly, room comfortable, however with no air-conditioning it could get a little warm on the hotter days. Staff provided a converter when I realised I forgot mine. Nice food at the Central Pub, and friendly service. Good location, 5min walking to St Stephens Green and 10-15min walk to the centre of town, very nice stay.",4,2016,08,31
248,Very comfortable for buisiness and private stays,"I stayed at the Camden Court Hotel every two weeks or so for over a year from October 2014 to January 2016 during my one or two days business trips to Dublin. The single rooms I had were very comfortable and provided all I wished for my purpose. The staff were always polite and courteous. The breakfast was abundant and tasty. From the hotel I started my walking trips to discover Dublin in the evenings. Although the neighborhood can be noisy at night, it's quiet compared to other hotels I have stayed at and I slept very well and visited my clients rested and in good mood after a nice breakfast. I'd recommend the Camden Court Hotel for their very good price-performance ratio, and my wife confirmed after she stayed there for several nights on a private visit to Dublin.",4,2016,08,29
248,Stay at the center,"This hotel is centrally located to attraction and transportation and shopping center.  Restaurants all around it, just get busy and moot on weekend night.  Has full sports amenities.  The staff are superb and the breakfast at the Iveagh is sumptuous!!",5,2016,08,29
248,Relaxing,"We had a great one night B & B with Dinner. 
The room was very warm. 

Dinner was delicious, Watermelon and Feta starter and Guinea Fowl main course. 

Very well-run hotel, plenty of staff.

The family room was very spacious with 3 double-size beds. 

Great location too.

Thank you!
",4,2016,08,25
248,Fab hotel for a city break!,"Picked these hotel as there were good reviews and it was a reasonable price for a 4 star hotel in Dublin. We arrived at 10am with the intention of leaving our luggage and going to explore but they had a room for us to check in straight away which was a lovely surprise. The rooms are great, beds huge and a smart TV so we signed into our netflix! The pool, jacuzzi and steam room are well kept and they provide fresh towels for you. Breakfast was full of variety although it was quite busy and manic at points! The location is fantastic for dublin, 20 minutes walk from Dublin castle and Grafton Street, 10 mins from St Stephens Green. We left our luggage on the last day without any problems and the bus stop for the 757 airlink is right outside the hotel. ",5,2016,08,25
248,Excellent hotel,"Had a really nice one night stay in this city centre hotel located close to the Luas (2 mins)
Good bar food and friendly efficient staff. Well appointed rooms immaculately clean with everything working. 
Small things like coffee machine, mineral water all supplied and top quality soaps and shampoos. 
Most comfortable bed and top quality bed linen. Really could not fault anything.
Best about the hotel was the staff who seemed to enjoy their work and were friendly and efficient at all times. Always willing to go the extra bit in such areas as bringing drinks to the table in the bar and charging phones for those of us who forgot to bring chargers. 
Overall a really nice hotel made special by the staff. ",5,2016,08,23
248,Exceptional Hotel,"This hotel is perfect for families and business travellers alike. The location is fabulous, within walking distance of the main shopping areas as well as tourist attractions. The onsite parking and spa facilities were an added bonus. Room was spacious and spotless, staff were friendly and helpful, breakfast had plenty of choice with hot and cold offerings. Definitely worth a visit.",5,2016,08,23
248,Camden Court,"I'm just back from a 2 night stay at the Camden Court with my husband and three daughters age 14,11 and 8. First impressions of the hotel were good. Check-in was good and staff very pleasant. Our room was lovely, very clean and huge, had a fridge, PlayStation, beanbag and slept 5 of us with no problem. Location of hotel very good, 10minute walk into city centre. Leisure facilities really good and staff were lovely- allowing my daughter to borrow goggles as she had forgotten her own. 
   Food in the restaurant is really nice although we had a bit of an issue on the first night when the waiter forgot to come to take our sweet order this was immediately rectified by a member of management. Our next night at dinner we had a complimentary bottle of wine and drinks for my children which I think was a lovely gesture. Overall this is a good hotel, only thing that really lets it down is that it has no aircon and our room got quite warm- again this was immediately rectified by staff who provided a fan. The staff in the hotel are lovely and I would return and recommend to family friends. ",4,2016,08,22
248,Reasonable hotel,"We enjoyed our stay at Camden Court Hotel. Nice and clean rooms and friendly staff. Breakfast is overpriced. But what bothered us most, was the temperature in our room. It was incredibly hot, even though the outside temperature was not that high. ",4,2016,08,22
248,Close to the action yet removed enough for comfort!,"The hotel was nice and the location was good as it was in walking distance to the main attractions yet just out of the craziness.  I wasn't thrilled with Dublin as it seemed to be where all the college kids were and most of our experiences were not with the warm friendly people of Ireland we had come to expect having just come up from the western and southern areas.  The hotel was surprisingly nice on the inside, woman at reception very cold and unwelcoming. The room was fine, included breakfast was good, and location suited our needs. You need to pay 10 Euro per night parking which wasn't terrible.",3,2016,08,17
248,Vacation in Dublin,"This hotel is beautiful, clean and modern. We had a family room and it was huge with 3 beds, colorful flowers outside of each window, an amazingly large as well as modern bathroom.The beds are so comfy and the pillows are perfect. Also, the bistro in the lobby has great food. You have to get the Fish and Chips (so yummy). The front desk staff is very helpful too. I will be back to this hotel.",5,2016,08,15
248,Another Visit,"I love this hotel, it is in a great location (for me as my brother lives nearby ) & it's only a few mins walk to St. Stephen's Green & Grafton Street. Had a lovely meal in the Bar, we ordered it on our way to our room after a visit to the Leisure Centre & it was ready when we came down. The pool & Jacuzzi are very relaxing. Breakfast is fantastic. Staff are excellent. Rooms very comfortable. I was surprised to find a fan in the wardrobe......it was indeed very welcome. Luggage storage available.",5,2016,08,14
248,"Nice hotel, good location","This was our first stop on our first trip to Ireland. Very nice comfortable rooms, and wonderful selection for breakfast, served late enough for tired travelers like us; after a very long flight from the US, the last thing we were prepared to do was get up very early.  We didn't ask for anything from the staff, but they seemed pleasant enough.  One guy at the desk was a little testy on checkout day, but that's o.k. and understandable, it's a very busy hotel with many large tours coming through.  Overall, good, clean pleasant to stay.",4,2016,08,13
248,Instant coffee in rooms,"Standard sized, attractive rooms.  Only 2 elevators but that never became an issue.  Close to local pubs.  Ten minute walk to Trinity College / 15 to Temple Bar and the river.  Outstanding breakfast options.  Pleasant personnel.  Rooms adjacent to Camden Street (busy street) tend to be noisy if you leave your window open.  Coffee/tea and hair dryer and iron in rooms.",4,2016,08,12
248,"Comfortable stay close to downtown, but not too close!","Nice modenr hotel nestled four blocks from St. Stephen's Green and Grafton Street.  Not in the noisy tourist center of the city, but close enough to walk to if you want to.  Staff were friendly.  Rooms were nice.  Wi Fi was good.  Lots of public area for talking and games.  Food was good - nice breakfast buffet.",5,2016,08,10
248,Great location a stones throw from everything,"Stay here every time we visit for a match. Great location close to everything you could need. Staff are brilliant always friendly efficient and accommodating. Breakfast is always plentiful and a great variety to accomodate all tastes, bar food is always great value and tasty. The gym is great asset. Rooms are simple and well appointed, never fail to get a great nights sleep. 
Would tthroughly recommend to all.",4,2016,08,09
248,"Wonderful,","If I could given 20 of 10, I would. The staff were lovely. The hotel was clean and easily accessible. The bar food was well priced and really nice. On a wheat free diet, the chef went over and above with our different orders. Thank you to everybody in the Camden Court, ye were wonderful",5,2016,08,07
248,Disappointing staff,"The hotel is nice and rooms are perfect sized. All the staff I encountered except for Mark at the front desk seemed extremely annoyed, tired and not helpful at all. 

The breakfast was good. Location was quite central. There is a pub next door which was quite popular. Always full. ",2,2016,08,06
248,Great hotel,"I regularly stay on business at this hotel and have never been disappointed. 

Rooms are very well maintained and always clean with some rooms overlooking the street and others looking onto the internal car park.

It's quite a busy place and breakfast can be particular busy but they seem to manage it quite well.",4,2016,08,05
248,Pleasantly surprised!,Very good accommodation in a lovely hotel with excellent customer service just a 10 minute walk from the main shopping area (in high heels).  We tried this hotel because it was cheaper than other 4 star hotels in the city centre and because it also had a leisure centre. We didn't expect  too much but I am happy to say that it offered a lot more than I expected. The bed was comfortable and the double windows block out any city noises so we slept well. The front of house and leisure centre staff were also very efficient and helpful. We didnt include breakfast but there was plenty of coffee houses nearby. We will definitely make this our first choice for a Dublin hotel from now on as you get more for your money.,4,2016,08,04
248,Great Hotel!,"Stayed for three days while with a tour group. Great location, safe area, good bars and pubs around. Room was excellent. Smart TV in room was cool. A great place to stay for an extended weekend in Dublin.",5,2016,08,03
248,Great Breakfast,"The Camden Court Hotel is a nice place to stay. The Hotel was very clean and well kept.  It does not have A/C so it was quite warm in our room in the evenings and a little loud during the night from the nearby Pub Patrons.  They served a ""Traditional Irish Breakfast"" which was very good.  The hotel is a little out of the way of a lot of Dublin's main attractions.  Approx 20 minute walk to St Stephens Garden where you can catch some of the On and Off Tour Buses  and approx 30 minute walk to Dublin Castle. ",4,2016,08,03
248,"""Fabulous Hotel""","Myself and my husband stayed here for a night over last weekend.  This was our second visit and it was not long enough.   Staff are welcoming, friendly and accommodating at all times.  We dined in the late afternoon in the Bistro and food was top notch and served by very friendly staff.  We also had a wonderful cooked breakfast next morning and it did not disappoint.  Secure car park for a fee of €10 is peace of mind.  You are within walking distance of Stephens Green and Grafton Street and other local attractions.  Love this Hotel and will be hoping to visit soon again.",5,2016,08,02
248,Fantastic location,"Lovely hotel. Superb location. Very friendly staff. Well decorated, clean rooms, parking overnight €10. Suitable for Wexford st, Camden st, harcourt st, grafton st areas. Great mixture of bars, coffee shops, restaurants in the locality. Airport bus stops nearby & luas stop around the corner. Hard to beat. ",5,2016,07,31
248,Is this really a 4 Star Hotel?,"This is a tourist hotel at best (coaches are a giveaway…).  Bedrooms have no air conditioning.  I mentioned this to reception...no fan offered as per hotel responses to previous reviews.  Hotel safe is not bolted to the furniture.  Go figure???  They provide a safe but don’t bolt it to anything.  Again I mentioned this to reception and the incredulous response was ""....we would notice anyone walking through reception with a safe under their arm..."".  I thought they were joking but after a pregnant pause, I realised they were serious!  Rooms are small with thin walls – you have been warned.  Ensure you have courtyard facing room to avoid noise from front of hotel with window open (remember....no A/C).  This is not a place for people who really know hotels – regardless of star rating.  The worst thing [for me] was having to pay a full rack rate of €200+ for the 1 night.  Shocking really.  No doubt there will be a banal response from a hotel rep to my review (please humour me and don’t reply…).  But paying that much for a sleepless night is a tad too much to stomach.  Not recommended.",2,2016,07,29
248,Nice hotel near everything,The hotel wass.very nicely done.  They were friendly  and efficient. It had good amenities and served a good breakfast. The only  fault is no AC and only a.small portion of the window to.open.  a fan is provided but the need to.open the window let in noise from the outside.  I would stay there again but in cooler weather. ,4,2016,07,28
248,One main problem,"The staff was great.  The location was within walking distance to most attractions. The one main drawback was a set of circumstances not entirely under the hotel's control. 

We went to Dublin in late July. This hotel does not have air conditioning, but the windows do open so this would  normally not be a problem.  We were on the fourth floor and our window opened onto Camden St. Apparently, there is a bus stop right at the corner. The noise seemed to go all night long. Cars honking, drunks yelling at each other, bus air brakes, etc.  The second night we purchased ear plugs and could still hear quite a bit of noise.  

If you do stay here, I would definitely request a room that opens on the courtyard or any othe street than Camden.",3,2016,07,28
248,Mini honeymoon,"Myself and my husband stayed for 2 nights in march..it was just what we needed after getting married...location was very central easy to get to...parking underground which is a great thing..when we checked in there was chocolates and a lovely note from the management to welcome us on our stay...the room were fab, spotless, smart TVs, orla kielys toiletries, leisure facilities we nice.  There was a lovely wee restaurant across the road cant remember the name but was lovely it was bring ur own wine.  The staff were more than nice very helpful and plesent.  I will visit this hotel again and bring the family and make a nice long weekend out of it.....",5,2016,07,28
248,Great hotel beautiful lobby and nice rooms,Great Hotel beautiful lobby and great rooms.  First two night and last night of Gate 1 12 day tour.  Centrally located can walk to almost everything.  Lively pubs including one thetis connected by common wall out front.  great food at breakfast and dinner.  Rooms nice clean well set up.  Service and desk very accomadating,5,2016,07,26
248,Great start to a vacation,"I spent two nights at the Camden Court with my daughter and her family. We reserved a ""family room"" which had lots of room. The room had 2 double sofa beds and one regular double bed. It also had a microwave and mini-fridge which was great for keeping juice and snacks for the kids. 
The room was dated a bit, but clean. 
When we visited Dublin was in the middle of a heat wave so the rooms were on the warm side. There was no air conditioning but I suspect that isn't usually a problem.
The breakfast in the restaurant was great with so many selections. A full hot buffet and a cold buffet too, in addition to a cereal bar.
The facility has an indoor heated pool and a nice workout room. Parking is on the premises for a modest added fee.",4,2016,07,25
248,Excellent Hotel,"Lovely hotel. Very helpful and friendly staff. Good room facilities with a comfy bed. Breakfast was superb with a good choice of hot and cold, even porridge!  Location was out of the city centre but on a bus route with lots of buses into the centre. Added bonus of being 2 min walk from the end of the airport bus route. No need for a car if you want to just do Dublin.  The 72 hour Freedom Ticket covered all transport including airport bus and the Hop on Hop off bus too. Well worth the money. We will certainly stay again on our next visit to Dublin.",5,2016,07,24
248,Nice 1 night stay,"Hotel is well located for the St Stephens Green area and only a 10 min stroll into Grafton street. Rooms are comfortable and as expected for class of hotel. One thing to note is I stayed on hottest day of year and the rooms didn't have AC so it was a really uncomfortable nights sleep due to the heat. 

Also watch out for the tour groups that use the hotel. Don't get stuck behind them at  breakfast. ",4,2016,07,24
248,Nice hotel but nothing glamorous,"This is a very basic hotel...the rooms are comfortable but nothing fancy. There is no a/c...but that's not uncommon in Europe. Make sure you ask for fans!

The breakfast is very nice, and the service in the restaurant and lobby very good. The lobby area is also nice and comfortable.

The location is ok...might g someplace closer to the action in the future.",3,2016,07,23
248,Ok,"The hotel was nice, our room had no air conditioning and made it hard to sleep so had to keep window open. Rooms were nice, a bit small for a 4 star. 
Definite con...right by a bar and there were screaming until 4 am and staff took forever to deal with it. Cops weren't called after over 30 minute screaming/swearing match. ",3,2016,07,22
248,Great city stay,"The hotel is in a perfect location. An easy walk to all the sites and crowds but a bit off the noisy crowded streets. Friendly, professional staff. Very clean comfortable rooms. Amazing breakfast buffet. We enjoyed dinner one night at the hotel. Excellent service and delicious dinner. Perfect place to stay in Dublin.",5,2016,07,19
248,Don't leave anything behind!!,"My Friends and I stayed here for the Beyoncé concert and paid €300. It was a pleasant enough stay, nothing special but ok.  Unfortunately I left a brand new top behind. Now I figured I'd just ring and they would send it to me. Unfortunately this wasn't the case! I rang and the receptionist Saidshe would check with housekeeping. She rang me back and said housekeeping had it. I said that's great could you just post it to me? Not an unreasonable request considering we were after paying  €300 for a room! She said she couldn't do that that I would have to email housekeeping. I mailed house keeping who said that they would post my top to me but I would have to give them my credit card details to pay for postage!!!! I was absolutely shocked that they just simply wouldn't send it out with the hotel's post. After paying so much to stay at this hotel I think the least they could have done was send me
My top without all this hassle. Disgraceful! ",2,2016,07,18
248,Birthday weekend ,"My friend and I decided to head to Dublin for a girls night out as it was coming up to my birthday.
Hadn't stayed at this side of Dublin so it was a nice change.
The staff here were very welcoming and could not do enough for us.
The hotel was big and very clean and our room didn't disappoint us either.
Had breakfast the day we left again we had no complaints.
Would stay here again and would highly recommend it.",5,2016,07,17
248,"Good Breakfast, Great Gym and Pool.",Our family stayed here and we were pleased with just about everything. The breakfast had a lot of fresh Irish fare ranging from cheese to fried egg. The jams were also very good. The accommodations throughout the facility were top notch including the fitness center and pool. Both were very large. Great central location south of the river located next to nice shops nearby on Grafton Street. If you can get a good deal definitely check it out.,4,2016,07,15
248,Never Disappoints !!,"This was my second stay at the Camden Court in the last three years. We arrived at Dublin Connolly train station and a taxi cost 10 euros to the hotel. We were able to get access to our room just after 11am, this process was swift and the reception staff were extremely helpful. Our room had all the essentials including a hairdryer, iron and safety deposit box.  The hotel is located within minutes of various restaurants which are highly rated on Tripadvisor and a number of supermarkets. A casual 15 minute stroll along Harcourt Street will take you to Grafton Street and St Stephen's Green. My wife and I both used the gym and swimming pool which were well equipped and not overly busy during the day. There are lockers in the changing rooms for one euro and you are meant to use a swimming cap in the pool. We availed of breakfast in the hotel over our stay and it was excellent with a variety of cooked and cold items. They will also cook your eggs in any way that suits your personal needs. I found all the staff very knowledgeable and professional in my interactions with them, which made this stay very enjoyable. Having stayed in  Dublin numerous times over the years I would definitely prefer to stay in this area of the City.",5,2016,07,15
248,Hen party ,"Stayed here for a hen party , hotel was clean comfortable and modern . Breakfast was Buffett style and the food was nice . The hotel is located to many bars and restaurants and we took full advantage of these . My friends visited an Italian just across the road which was BYOB and they highly recommended it . My only gripe was that I felt the hotel was slightly over priced but I suppose that is common in Dublin ",4,2016,07,15
248,Beautiful hotel,I have to say this hotel was beautiful and the food was fabulous.. were it lost one star for me and its such a pity but that they have no swimming pool.. it's just a little extra i always enjoy when I'm going to a hotel... oncthe other side the hotel was still amazing and I would defo stay there again :) ,4,2016,07,14
248,Weekend stay,Great location. Can be noisey but then again you are on the main drag and its about location. We didn't eat breakfast there as we were told by our friends who were staying there the breakfast wasn't great. Rooms were small and basic. Value was good though.Staff were nice.,3,2016,07,13
248,More than welcoming! ,"I stayed there last week with one of my friends for a night, we felt more than welcome by Emma at reception  she was incredibly helpful when we had a problem with the wifi on the 5th floor so she moved us to a lower floor! Definitely recommend staying here purely because of this lady!",5,2016,07,11
248,"Come for the location, stay for the breakfast ","We stayed at the Camden Court Hotel at the beginning and end of our Ireland trip.  Overall, a really good place to stay in Dublin. Here's some highlights:

- the breakfast buffet is great, lots of choices and very filling. We often ate breakfast here and didn't eat until dinner.
- the location is good.  It's not quite right in the thick of things (eg Temple Bar) but it's close enough to everything to walk to and from. The buses run right outside and the Luas tram (south side) is very close. Lots of restaurants and pubs really close. 
-it's very clean and orderly inside.  It's not quite highbrow but it's close.  There are certainly lots of businessmen and women staying there (and eating breakfast).  
- rooms are quiet overall and beds comfy.  Plenty of outlets for recharging, although no direct USB outlets. 
- TVs are smart Tvs, which means you have access to Netflix if you want to login.  This was the only place we found this, which was great for decompressing after long days walking. Irish television isn't much so this offers a good alternative. 
- staff is professional and attentive, even when approached by somewhat pushy guests (which we witnessed)

- Camden Court has its own wi-Fi which worked okay.  It kicks you off if not used for even short terms.  The televisions have their own wi-Fi and that cut off a few times as well.
- with 251 rooms, this is a spot for tour groups to stay.  This sometimes means that they have the dining room reserved for breakfast and there's a wait (we waited @15 min) for individual guests, which isn't great if you've got somewhere to go. 
- checking in early was a challenge our first day and we waited probably close to an hour, along with lots of other folks, to get to our room.  After a full day of air travel from the US, that's hard to take but we certainly were early.  Guests checking out, getting the rooms cleaned...it takes time.  
- there's about 10 spots of above ground parking and an underground garage that's serviceable but tight.  There's a $10 per day overnight charge to park a car. 

We checked out the workout room and pool / spa but never got to use it. Looked decent and clean.  

We would certainly stay at Camden Court again and recommend it! We would give it 4.5 targets if possible. ",4,2016,07,11
248,Great Place,"My husband and I just visited the hotel during our recent stay. The facilities are clean and pleasant. It is conveniently located in Dublin meaning it is a bit off the beaten path but not far away from the heart of town. We enjoyed our walk every day to the main sights and thoroughly loved the bar right around it- The Bleeding Horse. Though most of the staff was friendly, there were a few members who genuinely did not seemed pleased to assist us when needed. It was a great trip all things aside and I would recommend this hotel to all that come!",4,2016,07,10
248,Great rooms and service,"A really lovely hotel.
Easy to reach from the airport, straight on the 757 bus.
The room was light and spacious. The coffee machine in the room was a definite bonus, as a coffee lover. 
There are several shops and supermarkets nearby to get food, and it's a 20minute walk to the temple bar area and the river.
The staff were very friendly and helpful.
The leisure facilities are lovely, particularly the pool and jacuzzi.
The Irish breakfast was extensive and delicious.
The only downside was being woken by other guests talking at 4am a couple of days in a row who were outside the room. Perhaps the doors need sound insulating more?
Definitely worth a stay",5,2016,07,08
248,Good value for money and clean hotel,Friendly staff in normal business hotel. Bathroom typical english style shower only comfortable if you are not taller then 1.70m. I prefer shower via walkin and not in bath tub. Bed are comfortable. Breakfast nothing special but ok. Staff very friendly and supportive. Location nothing special.,4,2016,07,06
248,Just back absolutely fabulous stay,"Just returned from 3 nights stay at Camden Court Hotel, short 10min leisurely walk from Temple Bar area where all main pubs are, the walk takes you through Grafton Steet / St Stephens Green area of city so plenty to see on way back and forward, easy enough to take a bus or tram nearer if needed too,  hotel swimming pool, jacuzzi, sauna and steam room were an excellent addition to our weekend away, nothing better than a swim and sauna before brunch and a Guinness! Decided to just stay on a room only basis  as hotel breakfast was 16euro p.p and you can a great big breakfast anywhere from between 5-11euro and doesn't tie you to being up at a certain time, we had a beautiful lunch in hotel one day of toasted sandwiches, soup and crisps and was pretty reasonable price, much the same as in Temple Bar, great pub right next door called the Bleeding Horse, that also does great food too. Hotel rooms were spotlessly clean and decorated well, hotel reception was spotless also and all staff that dealt with us from reception, to coffee bar, drinks bar, leisure facility staff and cleaning staff were all exceptionally pleasant and helpful. I would highly recommend this stay for couples and also families as the pool would keep kids entertained too, bus stops right outside from/to Dublin airport also.",5,2016,07,05
248,Collins hen party ,"The hotel was brilliant. Staff were very helpful dealing with 12 ladies. The rooms were spacious, with comfy beds and very clean. The rooms for three people were enormous. 
Breakfast was very tasty with a wide range of food and endless cups of tea or coffee. 
Nighttime bar man was great and very obliging. 
Definitely stay again. 

",5,2016,07,05
248,Very good hotel,"Very nice hotel with excellent facilities.
The staff is also very friendly and the rooms are well equipped, especially the HD television is great during the football matches :-).
Also the location of the hotel is great, on walking distance from the real city center.",5,2016,07,04
248,Nice Stay,"Stayed here 2 nights at start of Gate1 tour.  Excellent staff. Easy walk to shopping & restaurants.  No AC.   Very noisy street. Stayed here during a big soccer event, so there were people hollering all night long...room is adequate....flat pillows.. 
Breakfast was very good.  Elevators are very slow & crowded when a large tour arrives. Single beds that are not very comfortable. ",4,2016,07,02
248,Mixed views I'm afraid,OK. The hotel itself is fine with decent rooms and friendly staff. The thing that spoilt it was large coachloads of noisy Americans leading to long queues at breakfast and an insistance on loud and noisy corridor conversations at a time when others were trying to sleep. To be fair it's hardly the fault of the hotel but it did affect the overall visit. Nothing against Americans but I wish they could have been less loud and more considerate.,3,2016,07,02
248,Almost perfect!,"I really enjoyed this hotel. Everything from the location, decor, friendly staff to the great breakfast, large pool, jacuzzi and attached bar was all great! The only reason I can't give a five star rating is the noisy room doors. Every morning I awoke from hotel room doors slamming closed on my floor. It was louder than I had ever heard anywhere else. Thankfully I needed to be up early so I didn't let it bother me too much but if I were just vacationing and wanted to sleep in, I would've needed earplugs. I hope they fix this issue because I would love to stay there again in the future. Perfect central location and great in every other way! ",4,2016,06,30
248,Very good hotel.,"Adequate room, really good food, excellent leisure centre.  The 16m pool is a gem, also has a decent hot tub, sauna and steam rooms, and a gym.
Only downside was the room safe; it was at floor level which makes it difficult to use.  Ours locked us out, had it sorted the following morning but was told by the duty manager that they were unreliable and we weren't the first to have had problems.  Would have been nice if we had been told before using it.
This is a popular hotel with coach tours, so can be busy at breakfast.  We went down at 0830 by which time it was beginning to be less busy.  Dinner wasn't a problem.",4,2016,06,29
248,Lovely experience,"Had 3 nights in Camden Court Hotel, and enjoyed it very much. The staff were friendly and helpful, and the hotel was in a good location for exploring the city. The bed and pillows were also comfortable, so slept well after a day of exploring! We didn't have any evening meals here, but the breakfast was very nice with a wide selection of food.",4,2016,06,28
248,Good location,"We stayed at the Camden Court for two nights.  Our room was quite large - I think it may have been a family room but we appreciated the space.  But  the location was what we enjoyed.  The Bleeding Horse next door was a good place to eat.  After dinner we walked to Stephan's Green for an evening stroll - beautiful park.  The next night we walked to the Hairy Lemon for dinner then spent some time on Grafton Street.  There was a small grocery nearby as well.  The breakfast buffet had a good selection of fruit, breads etc. a good cooked selection.  I would stay there again!",5,2016,06,25
248,Shabby,I stayed here last week paid upfront (unusual but no big deal) had booked a triple room as soon as I walked in I knew someone had been smoking in it the pile of cigarettes ends outside window also gave it away furniture was very shabby and worn certainly nothing like website suggests... A receipt for room service the night/morning before was found in sofa bed and I had to pick up 'false nails' from floor 😕...location of this hotel is excellent maybe I was just unlucky with room I got but for what I was charged it certainly did not represent a 4star stay..... ,2,2016,06,24
248,"Nice hotel, great location but noisy",Hotel prices in Dublin are on the way up but the Camden Court is still an affordable and comfortable hotel in a good location. It's only one stop on the Luas or a ten minute walk to St Stephen's Green and Grafton St. My only real issue was that the room was noisy as it was easy to hear people in the next room and in the corridor and the workmen outside. ,3,2016,06,23
248,brilliant breakfast,"the facilities are 4 star, but the triple room wasn't quite that impressive except for the big bathroom and fancy coffee machine. ask for a quiet room like we did, as there is a pub next door. breakfast had everything; cooked food, cold meats, salmon, cheeses, fruit salad, cereals, yoghurts and lots of different breads and pastries. location was handy enough for our stay and the hotel website has a tremendous amount of information about local interests.",4,2016,06,21
248,Good location ,When we checked in we had to pay upfront which is a little strange but maybe not for Dublin. I booked a twin room through bookings.com and when we got to the room it was a double! We rang down and were moved to a twin on 4 th floor. There is no air conditioning and the room was very stuffy we didn't open the window at night as there's a constant humming coming from somewhere I had asked for a quieter  room on booking. The bathrooms are quite small and compact but they come with lovely Orla kiely shampoos and shower gels. The telly is really big which is fab. Breakfast is very good with lots of choice I ordered mushrooms and fried egg but unfortunately the mushrooms were cold and I got an egg shell caught in my teeth! We had a drink in the bar and had to settle for a glass of Chardonnay as the barman said they don't have Pinot Grigio! Overall a nice hotel with friendly staff but a little pricey even for Dublin. ,4,2016,06,19
248,Good location ,"Good location but breakfast extremely over priced, no knives on the table, when I asked for one the waiter told me they were in the wash, I tried to take one from another table but guests seemed to have already taken all the knives from the tables because of the shortage. Buffet chef was quiet unpleasant! I called reception for towels and they didn't show up for roughly an hour, lady apologised for the delay but I had already showered using a hand towel!! 

Over all really good weekend, nice leisure centre. 👍🏻 ",2,2016,06,19
248,"Centrally located with great food, bar and entertainment","We were very pleased with our stay at Camden Court Hotel in Central Dublin Ireland. The rooms are not air conditioned as with many hotels in Ireland so understand that most Americans are spoiled by air conditioning in even the cheapest hotels. This property was well run with a great staff and 2 restaurant selections. One is fine dining and the other is casual. I would not describe it as charming or quaint the Lobby is spacious and modern and they even offered live entertainment in the casual dining area some nights. Bartenders, Servers and Desk Personnel were well trained and highly efficient and motivated. It is a well managed property.",4,2016,06,18
248,Good Hotel,"It's a good Hotel in a very good location,clean and comfortable.The food served in the breakfast lounge was nice.I can definitely recommend this hotel if you are in Dublin.
The pool is another cool benefit and the gym of course.
Service is ok too.",4,2016,06,17
248,"Great Hotel, Great staff, very good location","This hotel was part of a package deal for us and came with the tour - it is definitely  a 4 star hotel, staff terrific and helpful, breakfasts great - location very good: all major tourist spots nearby, many restaurants surround it in every direction.  Bus stop virtually on its doorstep. 
Everyone on our tour of 33 agreed.",4,2016,06,16
248,Caution - do not stay in Hot weather as no air conditioning,"The room was extremely warm & the fan that was provided as a ""solution"" simply moved the hot air about.  Also, the thick carpeting holds dust.  Location is great & breakfast is very nice.  I also highly recommend the gym.",3,2016,06,16
248,Excellent overnight stay,"Stayed one night, good hotel and the staff are excellent - had my daughter with me, and needed secure accessible parking, staff had reserved us a space and made this very easy, reception staff are exceptional, friendly and professional - nice rooms, ok not much of a view, but this hotel is about the location as opposed to the view!!! Breakfast was busy, but just as you would expect, and good wi fi - would highly recommend if you need to be in this area of Dublin, and its quite close to major attractions as well.....",5,2016,06,15
248,Brilliant,Picked this hotel for location and what a brilliant location it was. Very close to the city. Stayed in a family room which was massive. I am breastfeeding and was supplied with a refriedgerator. The bar man then gave me ice to transport it home. It's the little things that makes a difference,5,2016,06,14
248,"Nice Hotel, great location great rooms!,","Had a lovely two night stay in the camden court, the room we stayed in was large and comfortable with gorgeous decor, the leisure facilities in the basement  we used quite alot in our short stay  and they have all thats needed a small pool, sauna and Jacuzzi.  Although we did not eat in the hotel itself its in a great location in the hear of dublin with many fine restaurants on its doorstep. also the bleeding horse pub is directly next door where we enjoyed a great night of craic and live music!. All in all we had a great time in camden court hotel, and would most certainly recommend!",4,2016,06,13
248,Very nice hotel in a great location,"We spent several nights at this hotel during our first visit to Dublin.  It's conveniently located so we were able to walk all around the city.  The room was large, quiet and bed was very comfortable.  The included breakfast was delicious.  Staff was friendly, professional, and helpful.",5,2016,06,10
248,Great location & lovely rooms,"I stayed at Camden Court as part of a tour ( there were several tour groups staying at the hotel) and really appreciated its great location and proximity to most ""tourist""  and historical locations in Dublin.  The rooms were excellent and breakfast was adequate (though I remember a cranky server on the buffet line--every morning).  The Bleeding Horse next door was charming and a fun Pub for a Guinness before the evening activities.",4,2016,06,10
248,Great Hotel,"This is a four star Hotel. It has a spa center at the basement which we used. The only flaw I found is that the sauna rules were not in place. The room was clean and internet was working fine. We did not have any breakfast at the hotel, we preferred to go and eat something nearby. There are many healthy stuff places around. Location of the hotel is very good since you can easily walk to most tourist attractions in 15 minutes. This also justifies the price you pay for it.",4,2016,06,09
248,"great hotel upto the standard, except for breakfast service","The hotel is in a central location within the walking distance to all the city centre attractions and nightlife. The room was very spacious and modern with comfy bed. We really enjoyed our stay until the next morning. Breakfast was a bit chaotic, even though it was not busy. We were not asked if we wanted tea/coffee  until we had all our food finished and were ready to leave. Tables were not cleaned on time, so almost every table had a pile of dirty dishes on it. The food was decent enough though. Overall it was a pleasant stay.",4,2016,06,07
248,Beatiful stay.,"This is a modern, convenient, unpretentious, comfortable, very well-run hotel.  The fitness centre is not a dungeon.  The elevators are not death traps.  The lobby area is large and airy with plenty of lounging and meeting room.  The bar/restaurant is quiet and relaxing.  The main restaurant is very efficiently run.",5,2016,06,07
248,"Great location, helpful staff, wonderful food & rooms!","Location of the hotel is in central Dublin, walking distance to great sites like Stephenʻs Green, Grafton Street, St. Patrickʻs Cathedral, National Museum, Symphony Hall and so much more. So many great little restaurants, pubs, and shops near by...but the breakfast buffet at the hotel itself is incredible. Definitely worth a go if you want to fill up for the day...includes numerous meat options, fresh eggs, porridge, cereals, tea, coffee and of course many bread, fruit, juice and cheese options as well. There is a pool hot tub and sauna I hear...but I was too busy enjoying the city to get a chance to see them for myself. The rooms are adequate for a city stay and the bathroom definitely is big enough and then some!",4,2016,06,05
248,Lovely Hotel,Visted Camden Court hotel last September for a Birthday weekend the hotel was gorgeous. Check in was easy and we were shown to our room .The room décor was very modern and the hotel was about a 10/15 minute walk into the town centre of Dublin through St Stephens Green. As we were down for a birthday weekend we had a few drinks and enjoyed the spa the next day on check out. I would definitely go back to the hotel again as I thought it was value for money and in a good location. ,5,2016,06,05
248,"Convenient, sensibly priced ","I spent a night in the hotel because all the higher end hotels in Dublin were full. I was pleasantly surprised. Good bedroom, excellent breakfast (although there were a lot of people in the dining room so the buffet was a little chaotic). The only negative was that I had a room overlooking the road and it was very noisy - all night. Not the fault of the hotel but you should ask for an inner facing room if possible. ",4,2016,06,02
248,Exceptional Service,"We stayed at the Camden Court for two nights with a coach tour.  We found the hotel to be very comfortable, good wifi, and good food. It was also convenient to many areas of Dublin.  What brought it above and beyond for us was the service.  
After arriving at Dublin airport we discovered that we had left my husband's hat in the closet in the room.  After a call and e-mail we heard back from Christine in housekeeping that they had found the hat and would forward it to our home.  One week later the hat arrived.  It isn't an expensive piece, but has great sentimental value.  Thank you Christine and Camden Court.  I would not hesitate to recommend to any friends going to Ireland.",5,2016,05,31
248,Everything to a high standard- except the service,"Have been here on multiple occasions however the latest and possibly last was at a business conference which went on for a number of weeks. Unfortunately the staff were extremely rude to us- it seemed to me that since we ach individually were not paying the bill but our company was, that we did not matter. We were condescended to and really belittled on a number of occasions, even as we were trying to spend our own money at the coffee dock.

Will forward other locations to manamagement before booking there again.",2,2016,05,31
248,Great location,"Stayed here October 2015. Central Dublin is small. This was walking distance to almost everything. Comfortable rooms (if a bit old fashioned), nice bathrooms. Quiet - our room was over the side entry court. Tea fixings in the rooms, which we always like. Comfortable beds. Terrific gym and pool in the basement. Great breakfasts. We did not eat at the main restaurant, but we did eat one night in the bar, and it was good. Helpful friendly staff.",4,2016,05,30
248,Pleasant stay,"We stayed here for a total of 3 nights with our tour group Gate 1, 2 nights when the tour startsed and 1 when ended.  Both times the rooms were very clean, beds comfortable and bathrooms functional with decent size.  If you forget to bring an AC adapter you could borrow one from the reception.  They are very willing to help.

Breakfasts were great with many choices:  peameal bacon, smoked salmon and prosciutto- the best breakfast i had during our 12 days trip in Ireland.

Location is central.  We walked to places with different directions.  

We took taxi from airport to hotel and vice versa.  About 30 mins and cost euro 35 each way.  The drivers are very friendly.",5,2016,05,29
248,Excellent,"We warmly recommend the Camden Court for a stay in Dublin. Facilities atmosphere and staff were excellent. It is not far away from Temple bar and St-Stefen's Green, it proposes Nice Irish breakfast and muffins. And room was well equiped and nice.",5,2016,05,28
248,"Excellent location, Modern, Efficient Hotel","I staid here with a group on an Ireland tour.  The room was modern and reasonable size.  Nice bathroom.  Free wifi. The breakfast was complete, varied and in a pleasant dining room.  I requested help/info at the desk a couple of times and they were very helpful and pleasant including having a bag breakfast at my 5:30 AM departure to the airport.

This hotel is very well situated and you are able to walk to many sites of interest to tourist or the city tour on/off bus or a within a reasonable taxi fare zone.  The pub attached to the hotel is a very nice typical pub and convenient.",4,2016,05,23
248,Clean Hotel with good location,"The location was helpful for getting to sites.  The rooms were clean.  They were very helpful in allowing us to check in early as we arrived early from an overnight flight.  They also allowed us to store a baby car seat at the lobby storage area so we didn't take up more space in our room.  I found the morning staff more informative of sites than the evening staff.  Overall, I would recommend this hotel.",4,2016,05,22
248,"Nice and friendly, but poor wifi","I stayed for two nights at the Camden Court Hotel in Dublin. The staff was really friendly, and my room was cozy and nice. Breakfast was great. I would be very satisfied had it not been for the lousy wifi. My intention was to log on to my remote desktop and do some work in the early mornings and late evenings, but the wifi was simply too weak for that. The connection in my room was almost non-existing, and it was not that much better even in the lobby. So, for a ""unconnected"" traveler, this hotel is good, but for the business traveler, there's room for improvement!",4,2016,05,22
248,Close to centre of Dublin,"Great hotel, swimming pool and sauna ideal after a night on Temple Bar. Excursions also pick up from hotel. If you want to stay local to hotel a good few bars nearby. One fine example is The Bleeding Horse. Centre of Dublin and Grafton Street only 5 minutes away by tram",4,2016,05,21
248,Excellent Hotel but not in City Center,"This Hotel is very fine addition in Dublin Hotels. Advantages are: Nice big Hotel with indoor pool, plenty of waiting area, excellent quality of rooms, all amenities like Free Wi Fi in all of the Hotel, Spacious rooms with LCD TV, shower is of good quality with nice clean linens provided, plenty of hot and cold options at Breakfast, all day running bar and restaurant, Friendly staff. Disadvantages are location which is not in central Dublin and at least 20 minutes of walk / taxi Euro 7 ... Room rate i was quoted was Euro 103 per night .. Which is  quite good keeping in view expensive Hotels.. There are plenty of shops & hotels near by.",4,2016,05,17
248,Good city location,"The Camden Court Hotel is well situated for touring Dublin City, on the line of the inner city train and within walking distance of St. Steven's Green and many other interesting spots. The morning breakfast is very good and hearty. The pub is inviting and the lounging areas are comfortable.",4,2016,05,17
248,Pleasant Weekend stay,"My Family and I stayed here over a recent six nations rugby weekend.  The Hotel was busy and the clientele has a youthful, vibrant, cosmopolitan feel.
The staff where well presented and always helpful and courteous.  
The rooms where clean and with a high standard of decor.  However the shower/ bath was quite narrow, with the glass side panel, restricting movement some what.
We did not eat from the main restaurant but did have food from the bar menu which was excellent, as was of course the Guinness.
The main street outside the hotel is well catered for in restaurants and bars, and although the location is not city center, it is only 15-20 mins walk from the corner of St. Stephens Green and Grafton Street.  A regular bus service, on the road outside the hotel, will take you to Trinity College or O'Connell Street for a couple of Euros.
All in all an excellent base to visit the sites and sample the vibrant city of Dublin",4,2016,05,17
248,Great hotel - will definitely be back.,This is the second time we have stayed here (the last time being about 5 years ago or so) and its still a great spot in Dublin.  It is a five minute walk from St. Stephen's Green and maybe twenty minutes (in a straight line) to Temple Bar depending on your speed. The hotel is quite big and the rooms are well appointed and spacious - the WIFI is strong throughout the hotel. We were in 307 overlooking the street and it wasn't particularly noisy even though we stayed Fri/Sat nights. The staff are lovely and let me check in early at 11.30. The leisure area is great too - its been well kept and its very relaxing. The basement carpark is another excellent reason to stay here as well as its so convenient - remember to validate your ticket at reception before you leave. We stayed room only so I can't comment on the food this time around. It was quite expensive in my view but in the context of everywhere else in Dublin for those two nights it was well priced compared to other places that I have also stayed in that I wouldn't recommend as highly.,5,2016,05,16
248,Great Hotel,"A large group of us ( couples ) spent 3 nights in Dublin and this hotel was a great base. 15 mins walk from the town centre and next door to a very good pub.
Lounge area was spacious as was the breakfast area so ideal for a big group to meet up with in the morning to plan the day..
Rooms were well equipped and nice and airy and hotel staff were extremely helpful also

",4,2016,05,16
248,Very nice hotel in Dublin,"Camden Court is nice hotel, close to city center, by walking  arround 15 minutes. The area is calm. Hotels is big and they have many rooms. Rooms are nice, furnutures are new, bed an pillows are very comfortable and very clean. Restaurant is large and has fresh ambians. Loby is quite large. All the stuff is very helpfull and friendly. 
We were together with our group, 15 people. Everbody liked the hotel.
Have a nice holiday!",5,2016,05,16
248,Great hotel with few minor niggles,"My daughter took me here for my 50th birthday so I really wanted it to be perfect as she had really tried hard to find a central hotel with pool and leisure facilities.
I have to say the pool was fabulous 16 m so not too small to swim in with jacuzzi, sauna and steam room at hand. The changing facilities were a bit tired and I had expected some nice toiletries in the shower, however this was not the case, one dispenser of average body wash... As whilst on the subject the toiletries in the room whilst nice did not have a hair conditioner and as as swimmer traveling light I thought conditioner would have been supplied as standard in 4star hotels...I did ask but sadly they do not have any !
We stayed in a family room which was exactly as shown on the website, very nice with lovely crisp bed linen. The room was a little warm so we had the window open but it was very noisy on the main road and the noise continued throughout the night but that is all about being central in Dublin. It had basic tea and coffee and my gripe here was that when the room was made up on both days some dirty cups were just left and not replaced. Nothing we couldn't deal with but I had expected more
We only had breakfast once and it was fairly typical of 4 star standard with a good selection but again I was disappointed there was no low fat options such as yoghurts or milks. I did ask but was told they do not have them
It sounds like I am being picky with these little niggles but having stayed in many 4 star hotels it is just what I had expected . Having said all this I have rated this as a very good hotel and would recommend it . The staff are welcoming and friendly. It is in a perfect location about 10 mins walk away from Dublin centre. It has it's own area of great nightlife and is right next door to a great pub 'The bleeding horse' . There are numerous typically Irish bars with live music all only minutes away and it is directly on the bus route from the airport so very convenient all round. ",4,2016,05,16
248,Good hotel but getting a bit tired,"I don't want to complain as overall this is a nice hotel: the rooms are OK sized and clean, the Windows block out the street noise, wifi is free, the breakfast has a good selection and the gym is big. But there are little things that are just not good enough: the double bed has two mattresses, the carpet in the room shows its age, staff is over whelmed with tour groups at breakfast, the gym requires you to fill in all sorts of details just to enter (it's a membership gym rather than hotel guests only) and charges even for water. So, I'd go back but not too long and it requires an upgrade.",4,2016,05,14
248,Very comfortable hotel with excellent restaurant,I stayed here for 3 nights in May 2016.  The room and public areas were excellent with very helpful staff.  The breakfast buffet was excellent and it was great to be able to stay in the room and not have to check out until 12 noon.  Parking appears to be rather difficult at this location though.,5,2016,05,11
248,Central location,"Hotel is ideal for accessing city centre restaurants, bars and sights. 
Hotel itself was clean and staff friendly.
Disappointed with size of the room for the price charged.  
Breakfast was enjoyable with a good selection of hot and cold.",3,2016,05,10
248,OK hotel but expensive,"The room was comfortable and the leisure facilities good, except for the lack of a swim suit spinner which is a small thing to expect in a 4* hotel. The location is not too far from the city centre and a nice walk but the area surrounding the hotel looks a bit run down. Breakfast was good but let down by the staff, other staff e.g reception were polite and professional. Overall I think it was quite over priced.",3,2016,05,09
248,Seems overpriced to me,"This hotel is really well-situated, is clean, and had pretty tasty food.  The room was a decent size.  However, relative to other hotels we stayed at in Ireland, I thought it wasn't that great a deal price-wise -- for example, we paid only slightly more to stay one night (via their 'Stay on Sunday' discount) at the Westbury Hotel, which is about 5-6 blocks closer still to the heart of Dublin, and the two hotels are in really different leagues of quality.  Camden Court seems like it caters to groups (there were a couple business conferences going on) -- while our stay there was pleasant, and the staff were helpful, we'll probably try to get a better deal elsewhere when we come back.",3,2016,05,08
248,AMAZING!,"one of the best hotels ive stayed  in in my life!
The pool facilities are amazing and it's worth paying the extra
the food in the restaurant including breakfast and dinner, is simply amazing
The only downside about this hotel was that its quite a was quite a walk from the city, but that's worth the walk for the great pool!",5,2016,05,08
248,A long weekend away with myself and 10 friends to celebrate my Birthday.,This hotel was fantastic and I highly recommend it. The rooms were lovely as were the staff in all areas that we used. The location is perfect and close to everything. The breakfast was plentiful and very nice. I don't have anything bad to say about our stay. Each and everyone of us had a fabulous time and are very much looking forward to staying. again in the no to distant future,5,2016,05,06
248,A great Breakfast Buffet!!,"This is a great location, just outside all the noise of Dublin. We where only 4 blocks away from all the sites to see, and lots of shopping. The room was clean, the beds not to comfy, the staff was top notch and very polite. I think the best feature of this place was the breakfast buffet. They had everything and many types of coffee.
The black and white pudding is something that the locals love. I didn't care for it but the wife liked it so. To each there own..

We would stay here again only 12 mins by taxi to airport, very quiet with a nice pool and spa down below.",4,2016,05,04
248,Great stay! ,"This hotel was lovely. The staff were friendly, polite and helpful. The facilities were clean, modern and well presented. 

We ordered room service which arrived promptly. The food was good and reasonably priced. 

It is rare that I'm impressed by bathroom facilities in hotels, namely shower pressure however I was pleasantly surprised with the Camden. There was fresh linen daily and all the modern day amenities. 

The Camden was easy to locate and within walking distance of Grafton Street/Temple Bar. You receive one key card per person which is useful. 

We weren't aware that the Camden had a swimming pool so I will definitely bring appropriate swimwear next time so I can use these facilities. 

Would recommend. ",5,2016,05,04
248,Dublin Weekend,Has leisure facilities but we didnt use them.  Breakfast was good but just the usual selection.  Mostly it is self service except for the tea which they bring to your table and is just enough to have one small cup each.  Advertises king bed but is actually 2 singles pushed together. Aside of that the room was fine but just a standard hotel room.  Didnt use the main restaurant but had bar food which was good. Great cocktails and friendly bar staff. Reception staff were also very nice and helpful. Location handy for walking everywhere including Trinity College and Temple bar area. Nice hotel but a bit overpriced. We paid £156 per night.,4,2016,05,02
248,Good location,This is a beautiful hotel in the south side of Dublin. Lots of pubs and places to eat nearby. Rooms are very nice and so is the restaurant. Staff is also very friendly. The hotel is walking distance to many Dublin sights.,5,2016,04,29
248,comfort and location,"I stayed here as part of a large group, and found the room quite comfortable. Walking distance to many good restaurants and other attractions. Our group ate in the restaurant multiple times, and the food was great, and the service was prompt and friendly. Managing 40 people at the same time is not particularly easy, but the staff did a wonderful job from check-in to meals. We all enjoyed are stay.",5,2016,04,28
248,"Friendly and helpful staff, great location and delicious buffet breakfast","Booked last minute overnight after concert for five including teens. The hotel has a great location on Camden street adjoined to the Bleeding Horse pub. Couple of street entrances, if you have a car access overnight parking for €10 via arched entrance. The room on fifth floor and ensuite was spotless with large double, double sofa bed, single sofa bed and smart tv possibly not the most salubrious of the rooms normally on offer but adequate for one adult and four teens last minute at great rate. The interiors especially the ground floor and its layout is very stylish, the staff were extremely helpful and friendly. The breakfast buffet had plenty of variety including an array of fresh juices, mouth watering pastries, cereals and delicious hot Irish breakfast. It's a bustling location but well insulated from the busy street which was enjoyable to watch as we took our time over a leisurely and scrumptious breakfast.",4,2016,04,28
248,Overnight Stay,The beds are devine we stayed in a room with with a double and two singles.  Very comfortable- there were 3 of us.  Staff very friendly.  Location is ideal to Stephen's Green only 4 min walk.  Will definitely return,5,2016,04,27
248,Comfort and History,"The hotel was clean and comfortable. Staff were friendly and helpful. Out to the right was the LUAS and within walking distance St. Stephen's Green which was reached by walking down a row of Georgian houses. Across from the park is a shopping center. You can also pick up the hop on, hop buses on the street facing the Shelbourne Hotel. Cross the street here and take Kildare Street to the Archaeology Museum housed in a building as interesting architecturally as the exhibits. Keep going down Kildare and you will reach the Liffey. Look left and you will find the Kilkenny Design Center with Irish made gifts and a great cafeteria upstairs.",4,2016,04,26
248,Excellent hotel,Stayed here at the at the end of April. Good location about 10-15 minute walk into the centre of Dublin. Staff very polite and helpful . We arrived early but our room was available . Hotel spotless with excellent facilities . Recommend eating in the Bistro after a long day of sightseeing !,5,2016,04,25
248,"Fantastic stay, great location","This hotel is around a 15 minute walk down one long road straight into the hustle and bustle of the City center. We arrived on an early flight and the reception staff did all they could to get us checked in early, so friendly and a very well kept, clean hotel. the facilities were fantastic, swimming pool and area very clean. Would definitely return to this hotel.",4,2016,04,22
248,Fabulous hotel,"Stayed here In March 2016 for St Patricks Day.  What a find.  Lovely hotel, excellent facilities and very friendly/helpful staff.  Breakfast was very nice, lots of choice both continental and full Irish. Well worth the money.  The restaurant menu for the evening looked very nice but didn't eat there so can't comment.  The pool area was very nice.  Rooms clean, modern and spacious. Bar area nice and live music on some nights.  Surrounding area has plenty of good bars and restaurants, Temple Bar only a 15 minute walk away.  Couldn't fault it at all and will certainly book again for a trip to Dublin ",5,2016,04,21
248,Nice hotel and great staff!,"I stayed at Camden court hotel in April. The room was nice and clean. Not the best I've seen interior vice but ok in general. The staff was great tho, they spoke clearly and was very polite. They handled our party of 140 coworkers perfectly! And that's impressive! Thanks!",3,2016,04,20
248,Nice hotel in central area,One of the great things about this hotel was that it had onsite parking and was in a central location of Dublin. It also had good access to the bus system. You could walk easily to St. Stephans Green and the sites and shopping aound the area. The rooms were clean and very nice. The lobby had a restaurant and bar which had a very good breakfast in the morning. I enjoyed my stay there and would recommend it.,4,2016,04,20
248,Beautiful Hotel,"Definitely a great hotel to go to as a couple for a weekend away, there are plenty of buses around the area and also it is only a short walk to temple bar where you can find great live Irish music and great restaurants. The hotel itself was very clean and presentable with high standards throughout. 
Very friendly staff with a great, smart bar.
The breakfast we had was lovely a fresh and get quality.",5,2016,04,19
248,"Great location, good rooms and nice restaurant ",This is a very nice city hotel. The rooms are very comfortable and the bar and restaurant are very good. The best part though is the location.  Lots of pubs and restaurants in the area and its not a bad walk and easy bus ride to lots of sites. I would definitely recommend this hotel. ,4,2016,04,18
248,Fabulous hotel with all facilities ,"Lovely hotel, every facility you need including spa, gym, pool, sauna and steam room with towels provided. The area isn't so wonderful, however there are some lovely eateries a stones throw away and  the centre of Dublin is walkable. Taxis are reasonably priced if you are in a rush or less mobile.",5,2016,04,15
248,Nice Hotel but Rude Staff,"I attended this hotel for a course recently which was held in one of the meeting rooms.  Really nice hotel, great location and food was lovely.  Nice up to date décor with lovely meeting rooms.  However what turned me off was a rude man who was on the till in the Restaurant and seemed like he may have been one of the restaurant managers on the day. English didn't appear to be his first language so he did not understand me when I told him what course I was on, in order to sort out the lunch bill.  He stared at me with a really unpleasant face and basically made me out to be an idiot.  I looked around to see if anyone else witnessed his rudeness but there didn't appear to be.  I just couldn't believe that a member of staff in this hotel could be so blatently unpleasant.  I actually thought he was joking at first so I laughed at him but he stared at me with an almost angry face.  Really turned me off my lunch and from ever returning to the hotel.  I think the hotel could find friendlier staff.",3,2016,04,15
248,Really good hotel at a great price...,"A little further out from the heart of the city. I'd say it's about a 15 min walk to temple bar area. Which to me is great! Been to Dublin several times - so didn't mind being a little further out. St stephens green is where it's at these days - and this is less than 5 minutes walk... The hotel is more of a business travellers hotel. But we really enjoyed it here, and price was very reasonable for Dublin. Breakfast was also very good. The area is classed as Camden and area has more of a student feel - with Harcourt St. A stones throw away. There are lively clubs, and you will find some of the cheapest bars in the city centre.

If you don't mind walking and discovering new areas within the city centre - this place is unbeatable for value. If you want to just roll out of the pubs of temple bar and into your hotel. Then this place isn't for you.

248,"Lovely hotel, great service","We didn't stay in this hotel as we live in Dublin, but we were invited to a 21st Birthday dinner in February.  Unusual for a 21st, we had a full 3 course sit down meal for at least 50 people and we could not fault anything.  The food was fabulous, the service was great and all the staff were lovely and very helpful.
We adjourned to the bar afterwards and the staff there were equally good.
We would highly recommend this hotel for any type of party, we also noticed there were other parties going on in the hotel on the night.  But if you require a private room to have your party this is the place to go.",5,2016,04,05
248,Lovely stay with friends,"Stayed at the Camden Court Hotel with friends.  Friendly welcome.  Hotel decor is light and comfortable.  I had lunch whilst waiting for friends which was delicious.  Rooms spacious, spotless and very comfortable.  Special mention for the pillows - wonderful.

Would happily recommend the Camden Court to friends.",5,2016,04,05
248,"Fantastic Short Stay, in a great area of Dublin.","Stayed here on the weekend just after St Patrick's day. My previous stay here was in 1998- I was impressed then and even more so, now. 

Parking facilities are great (which is rare in Dublin), rooms are modern and comfortable, the lobby area is spacious and warm- as is the hotel bar. 

The Resturant is a fantastic space and the breakfast is the best I've had in well over a decade. Amazing choices and top drawer quality.

The health club is an added bonus- great for anyone who fancies a swim/Jacuzzi or Sauna/Steam Room.

Will stay here again next time I'm staying in Dublin (which won't take another 17 years)

Oh- go to the Bleeding Horse bar next door. Oozes character and atmosphere. It's got to be one of the best ""proper pubs"" in the world and one of the oldest in Dublin.",5,2016,04,03
248,Exellent hotel 👌,Stayed here with kids from our boxing club who were competing in the nationals at the national stadium and we were made to feel extremely welcome they met all our requirements for the kids training before fights and special dietary requirements would definitely recommend this hotel to friends and family and will be booking again soon,5,2016,04,02
248,"Friendly, professional and excellent food","We just returned from our stay today and I feel this hotel is worth so much more than the price we paid, which is a great comment to make when talking about Dublin hotels!! Myself, husband and 2 year old stayed here to do some shopping and visit the zoo, we are in the bar for lunch and it was lovely, then used the leisure centre which was spotless, relaxing couple of drinks in the lobby that evening and a great nights sleep! Breakfast was my fave! Great choice and great atmosphere! All staff were very helpful and paid extra attention to our toddler, in particular the leisure centre staff! The smart TVs are a bonus as I have a peppa pig addict :) Can't rate the hotel highly enough, hopefully see you all very soon..... ",5,2016,03,31
248,Mum and tweenage daughter...,"Hotel very nice, clean and well equipped.  Room great. Netflix available if you have account. Vending and ice machines on our floor.  Business people and families so not rowdy.
Pool and Spa together so although daughter couldn't use jacuzzi etc we could see each other.
Breakfast excellent value at €10. Had one evening meal which was very well cooked.

Location great. 10 min walk to Grafton Street area passing Tesco etc. No 16 bus direct from airport to outside hotel for €5. 

Daughter's only gripe - no biscuits in room.

My favourites -open top bus tour and day visit to Newgrange - Ireland's stonehenge . Going in to the underground burial chamber and watching a reconstruction of the winter solstice is  a memorable experience (tell kids it's like Indiana Jones and The Temple of Doom - they will not be disappointed).

Top tip - check if you need to book sights. Quite a few are guided and timed and limited numbers - Jeanne Johnston, Leprechaun museum, Newgrange, Kilmainham gaol. We missed seeing a few but that means we will just have to come back...

248,Mini break with husband,"Stayed in the hotel 2year ago with my daughter in law in October was excellent then and still is!!  The hotel is in walking distance to anything you want to walk too  my husband and I walked to the Guinness factory weather was good although it was on the Sunday of Easter rising Alcott of roads blocked off but we still got there and saw the marching at the same time  . The hotel is clean great food great rooms and facilities provided , the pool is great and relaxing after being out most of the day enjoyed the swim . The staff are more than helpful in all your enquirers and more than willing to help you sort a route out if need . All I can say that it is in a brilliant area quite but easy excess to all you want to go too  I would reccommend this hotel always and would defiantly go back without a doubt .",5,2016,03,31
248,Brilliant ,"Just back from a short stay in Dublin and would thoroughly recommend this hotel. The location is really central to everything, short walk to Grafton Street with plenty of good bars and restaurants along the way. Just across from St Stephens Green  - perfect for an afternoon walk or timeout from the busy Dublin streets. 

The room itself was perfect for what we wanted - spacious, clean and a really comfortable bed. The rain shower was a particular highlight! Good wardrobe space and an amazing HD smart TV too.

We used the pool a couple of times during our stay and it was really good too - clean and well looked after. 

All staff were really friendly, particularly at Reception and the hotel car park was an exceptional plus point - €10 per night for secure, city centre parking is very reasonable. 

All-in-all, a really brilliant hotel and would definitely stay here again. The only minor improvement I'd suggest would be the hairdryer in the room...but overall, thoroughly enjoyed our stay and would definitely recommend! ",5,2016,03,31
248,Superior hotel,"Great location. Clean and comfortable rooms. Breakfast is great, plentiful but a little expensive. That is offset by the cost to stay which is more reasonable. Very near restaurants and shopping and St. Stephens green. This hotel also offers parking which is a perk in Dublin.",4,2016,03,30
248,4 nights family room,"Have stayed here on 3 separate occasions now and I love it. Lovely big spacious room and beautiful clean bathrooms. 
It's location is superb. Walking distance to the green line Luas, st Stephens green and Dublin city centre. 
Excellent leisure centre if you want to use it yourself or keep the kids occupied for an hour. Live music in the bar.
Endless list of great bars and restaurants in the area. 
The only reason that this hotel is not getting a 5 is it can be noisy on the Camden Rd side of the hotel. I have to sleep with a window open especially in a family room and there was some noise from revellers coming home from pubs/night clubs and busses and trucks. If uku sleep with the window shut you wouldn't notice it as much. ",4,2016,03,30
248,so good,Really good hotel to stay in with very good friendly staff over there. With fantastic food fabulous Restaurant and  great Bar to watch live games in good flats screen TV . Overall really good to stay good location close to city centre,4,2016,03,25
248,Great,"Very impressed with this hotel stayed one night and was very happy ,great price, great location

Average
Bed room we most of had one of the poorer rooms, 601 if I remember right, right opposite the lifts so noisy with people talking whilst waiting on the lifts, small window, view was of the air con system pipes, room crowded with a very large bed and single bed but hard to squeeze past the old whardrobe to get near the bed, also no bottled water. If price was right I would return but insist on a different room",3,2016,03,21
248,Fantastic hotel. Can't fault it. ,"We arrived morning of St Patrick's Day and from the minute we arrived until we left three days later, we couldn't fault the hotel.  Every single member of staff were so friendly and helpful. It was my fiancé's birthday our first night and we ate in hotel restaurant. Lovely food and very reasonably priced. The staff found out and brought a birthday cake candle in a lime in his bottle of beer! Bar staff couldn't have been friendlier either. Food in the bar is excellent too. 
Our room didn't have any kind of nice view, but they can't all have one! Not the biggest room but it was big enough. However, it was spotless, had drink making facilities, we were left a little box of chocolates and two large bottles of water, one still and one sparkling. Breakfast is €10 if you book day before and definitely worth it. As much as you can eat of every kind of good you could possibly want for breakfast!  Full English, cereals, breads, croissant, meats etc. 
Contrary to a previous review, you can unhook the window lock to get more air into the room. 
We used the hotel pool and leisure facilities. This was a lovely bonus to have. The pool was great. Very warm. Also used the steam room which was wonderful. 
The hotel is about a 20 min, pleasant walk from Temple Bar. Could probably have walked it in less time but we enjoyed the views. Cost €8.50 by taxi to get there too. 
There was some live Irish music in the bar a couple of nights which was brilliant. Shame it didn't go on a bit later tho. 

Overall, anyone who has made derogatory comments about the hotel in other reviews is being petty!  Some people are never happy!! I have stayed in many, many hotels, from basic to 5*  and this is up there with the best of them. 
It was about the cheapest I found too for our dates. An absolute fantastic find and we will definitely be coming again and will recommend it to anyone coming to Dublin. Really don't want to go home!!

248,1st trip to Dublin - Will be back!,"Visited in 2013 - This was my 1st trip to Dublin. Stayed four nights at the Camden Court, Dublin, Ireland and it was lovely. The hotel was a short walk to St Stephen's Green and Grafton Street for major shopping. The room was comfortable and quiet. Staff was friendly and breakfast was decent. Recommend considering this hotel if planning a visit to Dublin.",4,2016,03,19
248,everything was good,"the hotel is great, defiantly a good recommendation for dublin, room and services were good. The staff was really friendly and willing to help they were really want when we walked in. Nothing to faulty about.",4,2016,03,19
248,Overnight stay in downtown Dublin,"Quick overnight stay. Hotel is conveniently located. Good restaurant and bar. Rooms are very good in size, clean, with all expected amenities, although a little dated. Property overall is quaint and lovely.",3,2016,03,17
248,Great location,"Stayed here last week with my sister on a girls break away, we were booked in for two nights, the room was lovely and clean, tea/coffee in room. We had to change rooms to a quieter part of the hotel for our second night and we didn't manage to get much sleep first night due to people being loud and rude in the corridors and slamming their bedroom doors in the early hours of the morning... Please note there is a bar which is open to the early hours of the morning ( think we were told 4am) I'm no party pooper but really! The hotel is in a great location just 10 mins walk to Grafton street so won't  take long to bring all your shopping back and if you feeling all shopped out get the tram back which is only 2 mins from hotel. The hotel also has swimming pool which is good for a city centre hotel. I would think about staying here again but would insist on a staying in a quieter part, not sure if I noticed any air con in the bedrooms so would ask this if staying in the summer.",4,2016,03,15
248,Good hotel in great location,"I have stayed at Camden Court 2x while on business in Dublin. The rooms are clean and quiet and well outfitted with amenities, coffee and tea along with the standard toiletries. From the hotel, it is a short walk to St. Stephen's Green area with dozens of restaurants and shops. Your parking is also included which is great given Dublin's sometimes pricy parking rates. What really stands out for me is the amazing breakfast. If you have the option to get breakfast with your room, do so. It has ridiculous variety for vegan, vegetarian and carnivore. The service is also friendly throughout the hotel. If there is any con, the towels were ratty and frayed on my second stay. It's a minor nitpick of an otherwise good hotel in a great location. ",4,2016,03,14
248,Lovely Stay,"Have stayed several times in the Camden Court and have enjoyed it every time. Its close to Dublin City Centre with lots of activities close by.  There are only two down sides: I think €10 parking overnight is steep. I always think parking should be included in the overnight stay.  The other thing was that our room was quite cold on checking in in the early afternoon In this instance, we quickly changed and headed out, but had we been staying in the room, we would have had to have contacted reception to have the heat turned on. Then overnight the heat was on all night leaving the room far too warm! The windows have safety frames, so you can't open the windows fully to let the breeze through. These were my only negatives!  On the plus side, the room was very clean and very comfortable, the bathroom spotless, and the bed, massive and comfy!  Breakfast the following morning was delicious, with lots of options. The staff too were very friendly and helpful. We'll be back!",5,2016,03,12
248,Hen Party,"We stayed here for my sisters hen party in February.  Rooms were really comfortable, room service was first class and great location for all of the sightseeing, shopping & good restaurants. Would stay here again and recommend to others.",4,2016,03,11
248,Great Hotel in perfect location,Stayed here with friends on a trip to Dublin. It's a great hotel with fantastic friendly staff who do all they can to make your stay comfortable and stress free. It's a short walk to the city centre . Room has everything you would require and the Food is great so no bad points really. The perfect hotel for a trip to Dublin.,5,2016,03,09
248,Brilliant,"Stayed here for two nights early March and had a brilliant time. Good location, lovely pool & gym, very friendly staff and clean comfortable rooms. The staff on reception are particularly friendly and even gave us a slightly late checkout for free! Would defiantly recommend to anyone thinking of staying in Dublin.",5,2016,03,06
248,Consistency,"This is about my tenth time staying here. Positives are ,clean rooms, great staff, easy check in, great breakfast and great location, also free parking. Again the most important part is the staff, very helpful and friendly, they just seem to wNt to help in any way, thanks again for a great stay",5,2016,03,06
248,weekend treat,"It was a short notice weekend away but booking was no issue and check in was fast and pleasant ,room was spacious and very clean ,found the road a bit noisy but over all would definitely return ..walking distance to everything.",4,2016,03,03
248,Gaiety Panto Stay Over,"This hotel was very fit for purpose, we booked two rooms, both very quietly well located within the hotel, spacious and very clean.  Beds most comfortable with the Orla Kiely toiletries in bathroom a lovely bonus.  Quick spin on the Luas to Stephens Green!  Lobby, Bar and Restaurant very nice, food excellent and good value. The added luxury of a Leisure Centre was a big success for the children. 
Safe parking which is a huge plus.  We will be back without doubt.",4,2016,03,02
248,Perfect for a business stay,"The Camden offers excellent value for inner city accommodation. As a business traveler all your requirements are met and ample food choices at the various restaurants offer a convenient and tasty option at the end of the work day. For a bit of relaxation the pool and gym area are just perfect. Staff are attentive, friendly and efficient. I would definitely be back.",4,2016,03,01
248,Excellent hotel ,"Lovely hotel, staff were very friendly and accommodating. Room was lovely, food was brilliant and location was perfect as it was a short walk to the Temple Bar area but lots of nice bars and restaurants along the way. Also very close to the shopping area in Grafton Street. Spa and Gym also included in booking and very good.Would highly recommend. ",5,2016,03,01
248,Excellent for business,"This was my 3rd time I visited this hotel. Breakfast is excellent, swimming pool and meeting facilities also. Wifi could be faster in the room. Location is very good nearby all key attractions. The staff at the reception was very polite and helpful.",5,2016,02,28
248,"Great location, good value","This hotel offers good value for city centre accommodation in Dublin. Lobby and public areas lovely. Check in friendly and efficient. Room was small, but nicely decorated and very comfortable bed. We were on the sixth floor (top floor) and heard no street noise which was fantastic. The room however was quite hot and stuffy despite the window open. There was a fan in the room which we had to make use of. Orla Kiely toiletries in bathroom were a nice touch.
We ate lunch in the bar, both getting the chicken burger. It was ok, nothing special and came in what looked like a ceramic McDonald's burger box. For dinner we ordered room service- a sandwich and a salad. Both nice. Breakfast the next morning was good. Room service were around knocking on doors at about 10am which was a little annoying considering check out is 12. Check out again efficient. I had parked in the hotel underground which was €10/night.",3,2016,02,28
248,Excellent food & service,Food in the hotel restaurant excellent. Wide variety of choice on the menu. Great value. Excellent service. Staff made excellent recommendations. Great location 2 minutes from St Stephens Green & the heart of Dublin.,4,2016,02,26
248,Nice hotel ,"We stayed here 17th-19th February for a late valentines break. The hotel is very well appointed and the staff are very friendly and efficient. 

We had a room on the 4th floor which was large and the bed very comfortable.

There was an excellent health spa in the basement, I particularly liked the pool and the steam room. The staff in the spa were very friendly, the best I've encountered in any hotel.

There is a nice restaurant in the hotel and also a bar where meals are served in the evening, we just had breakfast at the hotel which was very nice with an excellent choice.

We had a lovely stay at the Camden Court and would definitely stay here again. ",5,2016,02,24
248,Small rooms with noisy plumbing,"Booked the hotel for my parents recently. For the weekend in question prices in Dublin City were very high so the camden court hotel was the most reasonable (while still expensive). For the price of the room for two nights we expected at least for there to be two chairs (as the room was booked for two people) but we got one. the mirror was very dusty and looked like it had not been cleaned but otherwise room cleanliness was just average. The plumbing (heater and bathrooms) were very noisy, when upstairs used their facilities. The radiator made a loud noise when in use. 

While the staff were helpful overall I wouldn't book the hotel again, as for a 4 star rated hotel it was only average.",2,2016,02,23
248,Fantastic staff,We had a very comfortable stay here.  Staff are really excellent - knowledgable about the area and nothing is too much trouble.  The wi if is free and made easy for you.  The rooms are nice and the lifts very efficient.,5,2016,02,21
248,Beautiful hotel,"Stayed Valentine's weekend in this hotel. Arrived early and our room was ready. Very quick check in. Hotel staff very helpfull and friendly. The room was clean and had a large comfortable bed. Nice bathroom as well.  Great location. Grafton street, Temple Bar, Steven's Green all within walking distance. Taxis available outside hotel which was convenient.",5,2016,02,21
248,Anniversary ,"Stayed here for two nights. The hotel has clean warm rooms, lovely and well organised breakfast. Short walk into the town and restaurants, nice swimming pool and facilities. Welcoming and polite staff. Great weekend would definitely recommend and return. ",4,2016,02,21
248,Old fashioned courtesy and great service,"For four of us on a Dublin break, the Camden Court provided a superb stay. On a cold, damp weekend, the warmth of the welcome and the quality of the experience more than made up for the inclement weather. The hotel is nicely located in the south end of the city, outside the really touristy bit yet a short walk from St Stephen's Green and Trinity. The rooms were clean and well-appointed, with the usual tea and coffee. One tiny moan - just tea and coffee - no biscuits!  Breakfast was excellent. A full range of the usual cereal, croissant and fruit offerings, with a range of juices, including an intriguing 'juice of the day', freshly made and blended from an interesting and changing set of ingredients.  The cooked breakfast was served and therefore avoided huge trays of congealing egg. We did not eat in the restaurant, short of some decent midday snacks. Freshly cooked and, like everything about this hotel, great quality.
Wifi is free and available all over the hotel. However, it dropped out quite quickly and, while we were there, they had some server issues that took a while to resolve.
There is a gym, in the basement but, hey, we were on holiday...",5,2016,02,20
248,Utterly amazing hotel ,Stayed her Thursday to Monday with my husband is made a mix up when I booked the rooms booked a twin instead of a double the hotel were happy to change this they let us check in early the staff were amazing a massive thank you to Anna at the front desk and niki in the restaurant you made my birthday amazing ,5,2016,02,19
248,Beautiful hotel & fantastic staff,"The room was perfect, the staff were extremely helpful and they helped plan a surprise for me with my other half which made the experience all that much better. The only down side was the fact we was on the 5th floor which seemed to be where all the party goers and young adults decided to have a after party on the corridor. Only 15 minute walk from Temple Bar and would definitely go back to this hotel!",4,2016,02,18
248,Valentines Break.,"Lovely Hotel, pretty central to the Town, friendly staff, rooms well presented and clean, nice breakfast, only minus they charge 10 Euros per day car parking, last visit it was free. overall we had a pleasant stay. would go back in the future.",5,2016,02,16
248,Competent hotel,"Modern, clean hotel. Easy walking distance to Trinity and museums. Good dining room, excellent buffet breakfast. A very good pub is part of the property with several more a short walk away. Excellent range of dining choices in the area.",4,2016,02,15
248,Safe & Inviting  ,"Me and my partner went to Dublin for a long valentines weekend, we booked this hotel as it offered a spa & good facilities. 
Unfortunately we were given a room whereby the heating was faulting meaning the room was BOILING! Upon complaining we were moved rooms and offered complimentary breakfast the next morning.
The room was cosy and inviting and had brilliant facilities.
We booked a Valentines dinner in the hotel restaurant which was to die for!! Waitress was friendly and accommodating. 
C Central bar was great too. Staff were all very friendly and done everything in their power to assist your needs. 
Spa was a little disappointing. There is a sauna and a steam room along with a jacuzzi and pool - This experience would be soooo lovely if there wasn't children screaming in the pool! 
Overall the hotel was warm and welcoming - a very pleasant experience for our romantic weekend away. ",4,2016,02,15
248,Great Location if you like food & drink,"Super little hotel in a lovely area of Dublin with plenty of niche restaurants and bars, provided a great selection for breakfast and there on site leisure facilities were ver welcome..would certainly stay there again",5,2016,02,15
248,How a hotel should be.,"A good hotel should make you wish you could stay longer. The Camden Court does it for us. The smile and cheerful ambiance that greets one at check in, then seamless service throughout our stay make this our number one hotel in Dublin. 
The excellent Irish breakfast and the clean and well maintained leisure centre plus ideal location are just some of the reasons for recommending this hotel. The rooms are of generous proportions and very clean. The bed was was a little on the firm side but I would struggle to find anything really negative to report.",5,2016,02,13
248,"It's ok, nice little pool with hamman but it's not really 4 star","It's ok, it won't hurt you, the location is good. The pool is good as is the gym and hamman. The shower is very powerful. So not bad at all and the people are very pleasant. But the rooms are not 4'star they are small, there is no extractor fan so all is steamy. Bit tired and old fashioned. Telly is big. It's all perfectly OK, just could be a lot better. Kids not allowed in the pool after 7pm, and not allowed in the hot tub if under 16. Bit annoying as it doesn't make this clear and youngest son only 11. Good if you want to get away from kids, which I understand. Am just not excited and I like to be excited.",3,2016,02,12
248,5* All day long.,"The hotel is wonderful. 
It's well kept and has everything you'd want from a hotel. Great bar and really nice food, Gym, Spa & friendly staff. Breakfast is fantastic, hot buffet and eat as much as you like. Wide selection of food available. 
Location is good for the Aviva Stadium and a short walk to the Guinness storehouse also its not too far from the shops in Dublin centre.",5,2016,02,12
248,Perfect for a weekend,"We stayed for two nights at this Dublin city centre hotel as part of a 6 Nations weekend.  Everything about the room was adequate for a weekend stay; the bed comfortable and bathroom clean and stocked with beautiful toiletries.  The buffet breakfast, while extremely busy, was good and the staff although rushed of their feet, provided a suitable level of service.  We did not dine at the hotel but sampled some of the excellent restaurants nearby.  This hotel is ideally located for exploring the city on foot.  I would definitely recommend it for a short stay when in Dublin.",3,2016,02,11
248,Great rooms recently refurbished. Slightly let down by service,"Excellent rooms recently refurbished from when I last stayed a few years back. Service was a bit of a let down - receptionist was surly and restaurant staff weren't great (giving me a hot plate to put on the table that he carried with a serviette because it was so hot), and then said they didn't take Amex when they clearly did as I paid with it the next day.",4,2016,02,10
248,Great stay,"I was to the CC Hotel just for a night and it was an excellent stay: great room with very clean bathroom, super-comfy bed and sheets, high quality service from all personell.

I enjoyed the continental breakfast in the following morning and it really kick-started my day.",4,2016,02,09
248,Excellent one night stay for rugby international,"A friend and I stayed for the Sunday night of the Ireland- Wales rugby international. Reception desk staff were very polite and helpful. Room was excellent - clean and well equipped and had a security safe. Breakfast in the morning was good. Excellent choice available. Enough servers to respond without delay (quite unusual in large hotels these days). The cooked breakfast was from the buffet but there was a server  to put the items on your plate. There was roasted bacon was sliced in front of you by the server, and the bacon was excellent.  We also had a meal in the restaurant the night before. Service was excellent especially Niki the front of house person who also was a server. She was very good at engaging with customers and was prepared to do that little extra to respond to requests e.g. in response to our question whether they had a pie or crumble available as a desert (since it wasn't on the menu) she went to the kitchen to see if they had anything in the freezer in the kitchen.  She also had chicken added to the vegetarian stir fry that was on the menu at my friend's request. The food was good, well cooked and presented.

The hotel is convenient for the Temple Bar and St Stephen's Green areas of Dublin centre, although quite a long walk from the Aviva Stadium.
Overall a very satisfactory experience.",5,2016,02,09
248,Lovely hotel,"Hotel was in a great location, lovely and modern, clean rooms which we requested a triple room which had 1 king size bed, 1xdouble sofa bed, 1x single sofa bed(which meant a bed each) all very comfortable!! Staff couldn't have been more helpful and polite! Hotel was in a great location and lots of lovely cafes, restaurants within walking distance!!! And very good value for money!!!Would definitely return to stay at this hotel again!! ",5,2016,02,09
248,Weekend away in Dublin,"Lovely hotel, very clean and busy with the rugby fans. Its in a good area with lots of bars and food places near by and everything is in a walk able distance. Room was very spacious with a smart TV, free WI-FI and lots of mirrors (always a female issue when there isn't a mirror near a plug socket). Would recommend.",4,2016,02,09
248,Management need to up their game,"This hotel is nice enough, the decor is a little bit worn in places. The location is good for sightseeing, with lots of things with in walking distance. Good points were the breakfast - a good standard with plenty of variety and two staff members Georgi (reception by day) and Gary (night porter/manager).
Bad points are the service and a large number of the staff have the wrong attitude. We found apart from Gary and Georgi the staff were rude and frankly clueless about customer care. ",3,2016,02,08
248,Not quite good enough,"Room fine and clean. Location good. Breakfast experience was rather disappointing. Staff in the restaurant were unprepared for the number of customers. A school dinners system was put in place where customers queued and were served by a miserable member of staff who slapped the food onto tthe plate. Popped in for a drink in the bar and again it was short staffed with those who were working, looking miserable and not engaging with the customer. on Saturday evening asked reception to recommend a decent local restaurant which the receptionist couldn't do, instead directing us to Camden Road where there ""are lots of restaurants."" Not actually what I asked.  Monday morning checkout receptionist brilliant. Sorted out bag storage, booked a taxi and directed us to a local cafe for breakfast.  Nothing was too much trouble and he was well informed.  Consistency is the key and sadly it was a bit hit and miss this weekend",3,2016,02,08
248,Good Location ,The Camden Court is a 5 minute walk to St Stephens Green Shopping Centre. The reception staff are very helpful. The rooms are beautiful but like any hotel always ask is there building works in progress. The self service breakfast was excellent with a huge variety and open until 11am on a Sunday. There is a large Lobby to relax in. The most important thing not to forget when visiting the Camden Court is swimwear because the pool is a must and all its facilities and the lift opens beside it. Taxis are available and in room 202 no noise from traffic.,5,2016,02,08
248,Rugby weekend,"A lovely hotel in the heart of Dublin I would highly recommend. This hotel  is spotlessly clean the staff are very helpful and  always cleaning the place, we only stayed for 2 nights and we thoroughly enjoyed our stay, we stayed on bed and breakfast board, the breakfast is buffet style with everything topped up all the time, full English or continental something for everyone , outside the hotel there are many pubs cafes and resteraunts, I would give this hotel a good 9+ out of 10 for accomadation service and location .",5,2016,02,08
248,Very good overall,"Service was excellent - staff were very friendly and accommodating. 
Facilities were good based on price - an older hotel that has been extensively renovated it would appear. 
Location was great - very close to St. Stephen's Green. 
The pub next door (Bleeding Horse) was lively and fun. ",4,2016,02,07
248,I have stayed here on two separate occasions and look forward to returning.,"This was my second time going on a tour with Larry Kirwan arranged through Hammond tours and my second time staying at this hotel.
It is most definitely a very nice hotel however it seemed quite noisy this last time.
Had a bit of trouble sleeping due to the noise and I don't remember it being that way last time.
Also for some reason we had no coffee or tea making facilities in our room this time.
I don't know if somehow that was overlooked by the staff or what happened.
That is one of my favorite parts of going to Ireland is enjoying a nice cup of tea and I most definitely like my caffeine in the morning.
The room was definitely clean and comfy and I'm sure as I plan on going with Larry's group again in the future that I will most likely stay at Camden Court again.",3,2016,02,01
248,Good hotel relatively close to the city centre ,"I found this hotel to be a good place to spend the night. Rooms are large enough and well equipped with all the standard staff a guest normally needs. The bathroom was good although not particularly new and a bit small. Breakfast was charged 19 euro on top of the room fee. Although disclosed, I found this to be a high price. Clearly it also depends on the specific offer that one books. I would come back again there. ",3,2016,01,28
248,"Excellent value, super location!","We travelled here as part of a group of 21 people to celebrate a 50th birthday party. Despite us all arriving to check-in at the same time the procedure was fast, friendly and efficient. We had all been placed in rooms on the fourth floor and all the rooms were clean, modern and spacious. 
The service in the hotel bar was absolutely brilliant. Breakfast next morning, although not cooked to order, was of an excellent standard. The Irish bacon and sausages were absolutely lovely and there was an extensive cold selection for those not wanting anything as heavy. 
We had booked a meal in the hotel on Saturday evening to celebrate the 50th birthday. The hotel had, prior to our arrival, sent us a menu through to check that we were happy with the options. They provided us with a beautiful choice of starters, mains, desserts and tea and coffee for a very reasonable set price. Part of the restaurant had been set aside for us and they were only too happy to let us put up a banner, balloons and use table confetti as part of our celebrations. The food was absolutely delicious and the service was friendly and efficient. 
The leisure facilities at the hotel are spotless and were put to good use by several members of our party. 
The location of the hotel is perfect for exploring the city and we were able to get around on foot for the majority of our stay.
The Camden Court is a fabulous hotel for anyone visiting Dublin, the staff are very helpful and friendly, the rooms are well decorated and clean and the location is fabulous. It also provides very good value for money for a hotel in the centre of Dublin.",5,2016,01,27
248,Excellent value for Dublin,"Good location, fine room, hotel food very good. Staff were very courteous I had stayed here before my companion was very impressed.  The hotel is very well located for central Dublin and excellent for the National Concert Hall which is just around the corner.",5,2016,01,25
248,Nice stay,"Booked this hotel for one night, the price was great and it was close to St. Stephens Green which was what we wanted.
Our room was spacious with an extremely comfortable bed and great shower complete with Orla Kiely toiletries.
A tip for a quiet stay is ask for a high floor away from the Main Street, we did this and had a great nights sleep!
The residents bar had two friendly bar men who were very attentive which was a bonus.
We had breakfast in the restaurant and it was lovely with a full hot buffet and continental options.
My only negative for this hotel was the lack of cutlery! The day we arrived I ordered a sandwich at the bar, it arrived quickly but no cutlery was provided or offered.  Again at breakfast I had to ask two members of staff for cutlery and cups - it's a small issue but one that management should rectify.
Overall the hotel was great, spotlessly clean with nice staff and very comfortable.  We will definitely return! ",5,2016,01,24
248,Hoildaymode 29,Great hotel  lovely friendly staff the rooms were very spacious  and had a great power shower  the breakfast was to die for very tasty a nice 10min walk to grafton street  would stay here again just lovely,5,2016,01,22
248,Stayed October 2014,"We stayed here for three nights in October 2014. The hotel is in a great location and good value for money, lots of bus stops and the Luas stop just down the road. Our room was spacious and very clean. We ate in the bar one night and had a pizza which was lovely.",5,2016,01,21
248,"Good location, good food; however disappointed under 16s cannot use gym at all","Stayed two nights, two rooms.
Overall good experience.
Location very good for exploring central Dublin, just a 5 min pleasant walk to Stephen's Green. 
Food excellent - good breakfast buffet; dinner also.  One suggestion - some vegetables with the breakfast buffet (appreciated by some continental europe visitors).
Pool/sauna area is fine, although pool not too large - hard to swim once there are 3 people already swimming.
Would have appreciated bathrobes in the bedroom as it is inconvenient to dress up just to go down to the pool.
Disappointed that teenagers under 16 are not allowed to use the gym at all. My daughter couldn't work out with me.",4,2016,01,21
248,Felt like it was close to everything we wanted,"At first we had some problems finding the hotel because we were from the UK and hadn't thought through getting from the airport to there. But, once we found it, we were very impressed. Tucked away just off Camden Street, the hotel is private considering it's slap bang in the city centre. Staff were helpful from the outset and facilities were great overall too. Room was beautiful with a big Smart TV and all the domestic appliances we would need ie hairdryer, ironing board, kettle. Not much of a view considering where it was, but what can be expected on a city break? Best part about it was how close it was to shops, bars and restaurants. Fifteen-minute walk to Grafton Street, which leads on to O'Connell Street and Temple Bar isn't far either. Easy enough to visit some of the bigger tourist attractions too - we walked to the Guinness Storehouse, Kilmainham Gaol and Trinity College no problem. Only downside was the price of the breakfast one morning. 16 euros each is a bit steep for what we got. But, all in all, a brilliant hotel and would definitely visit again. Will be recommending to any friends interested in going to Dublin too.",4,2016,01,20
248,Pre 40th birthday treat with sister,This hotel was wonderful. Located on the south side of the city and only 10 min walk to main shopping of grafton street. Great facilities. Rooms were tastefully decorated and clean.  only one downside couldn't find a vent or fan in bathroom so was very steamy. Breakfast was great. Plenty of choice for all tastes. The gym was fairly basic but the pool made up for it with the jacuzzi and sauna. Only thing there that I found not to my taste was a family letting there baby in the pool with just a normal nappy on when the little swimmer ones were available at reception. But apart from that would definitely recommend if you plan to stay in dublin. And plus a great pub rite next door and great restaurants nearby ,4,2016,01,19
248,Great hotel,"Conveniently located to all the top attractions in Dublin.  Friendly staff, nicely appointed rooms good restaurant and nice bar. Would recommend to friends. Stayed here with a group of friends and had a wonderful time.",5,2016,01,16
248,Excellent location and value,"This is a very good hotel. It's location on Camden Street is perfect, less than 10 minutes to St Stephen's Green and15 minutes to the bottom of Grafton St. For the rates they charge, everything about the hotel is very good value. The breakfast has improved since I last reviewed on TI. The dinner at night is excellent. Where would you get Guinea fowl or Lobster linguine for around €20? The quality of the food puts some of the more pretentious restaurants in this area to shame. The rooms cannot be faulted and the family room offer for 2 adults and three children won't be beaten.Highly recommended.",4,2016,01,12
248,Fantastic,"“We throughly enjoyed our stay at the Camden Court Hotel. I booked it for my partner's birthday and we stayed one night. The staff were exceptionally pleasant and friendly and the facilities there are excellent. The location is perfect and we didn't leave Camden Street at all that night. We discovered an amazing Syrian restaurant called Damascus Gate right across the road and we had a couple of drinks in some bars nearby. Plenty to choose from! We had brought our swim wear to avail of the pool and hot tub the morning we were leaving but we were so well rested after our sleep and delicious breakfast that we didn't feel the need to. It was nice to have the option though! The facilities in the room were next to none, I was able to link up my tablet to the smart tv which was great and the Orla Kiely shower gel etc was a nice touch. Fantastic value for money also. I can not wait to have an excuse to book here again, hopefully my partner will book for my 30th later in the year! :)”",5,2016,01,11
248,Loved this hotel!,"Have just checked out from my stay at Camden Court Hotel and I have to say it was a brilliant hotel. I was away with a large group of friends and the staff were very accommodating trying to get us rooms close together. The room was clean and modern, good size TV and the location was perfect for going out for a night out. The breakfast was excellent really good selection and staff were lovely and couldn't do enough for our group. 

Had a fantastic stay and I will definitely be back at some point in the near future.

",5,2016,01,10
248,"Very nice hotel, it is a pity for the first night!!!","Duration of the stay: 6 nights. Price: 880 euro without breakfast

I had chosen this hotel as it is very central, you can walk more or less everywhere and it is 7 mins by foot from St Stephen's Green. I would say it is in a safe area, nothing happened to me, but yes, I was not coming back later than 10:30 pm. The neighborhood may not be so safe: the first day I got lost, I went to the opposite direction, and yes, there I was not feeling very safe.

Amongst the various possible hotels, this also had the advantage of having the leisure centre, with a 16 metre swimming pool, Jacuzzi, sauna and steam room.

They have more than 250 rooms, so this means that for some of the staff you may be just a number...This is what happened to me as soon as I arrived... the guy at the reception was not really welcoming and when I asked if the room was quiet, far from groups of young people, etc...he answered in a rude and cold way....

So, I went in the room and I immediately understood that something could have been gone wrong: my neighbours were those kind of impolite people screaming, listening music at high volume...etc...Results: at 3 in the morning, when they entered from a Friday night out, I was woken up by their music, etc...I waited for a while, they were not stopping, I called the reception. 

In order to avoid to spend the remaining 5 nights in the same way, I went to spoke with the responsible persons. At that moment I fortunately met two nice people, Blànait (spelling probably wrong! :( ) and Pavlon...they were really comprehensive and helpful..having checked that the ""nice"" neighbours were not leaving that day, they let me change the room....and then no problem any more.

Room nice, clean...etc....no complaints at all for all the other aspects!!! 

It is a pity then for the first night...the mark could have been higher!!!! :)",3,2016,01,09
248,Lovely hotel very helpful friendly staff,"Arrived 4th Jan and as previously agreed flowers and procecco in room for my friends birthday and the receptionist was very discreet about this. Thank you. Had access to leisure facilities which were lovely. Very quiet and relaxing myself and friend throughly enjoyed jacuzzi and pool. Could do with individual changing cubicles though. Couldn't work out how to get the radiator to work and room was quite cold during winter period. Very good location as quite central lots of bars restaurants and shops around. 
Room cleaned daily and towels changed if needed. Really enjoyed our stay would come again. Thank you. ",4,2016,01,07
248,Lovely New Year Stay,"Stayed for three nights from 30th December. The hotel is very welcoming, clean and comfortable. The breakfast is excellent and the leisure facilities are great. The staff are so friendly and helpful that you feel more than welcome the moment you arrive.
The only down side was that our two older teenage children were not allowed in the bar on New Years Eve but this was quickly remedied by us being able to sit in the lobby which is more like a lounge to see the New Year in. The staff even brought out a cake and champagne as requested by my husband, singing Happy Birthday to celebrate my 40th! It was very much appreciated.
We would certainly stay here again and recommend to others.",5,2016,01,06
248,"Very nice hotel, easy walking distance to center of Dublin","We stayed at this hotel late in October for a couple of nights and really enjoyed our stay.  The room was very nice, clean and quiet.  The lobby was welcoming with lots of sofas and other places to sit and the bar was terrific, nice selection of beer and wine and surprisingly reasonable prices!  We walked the 6 or 7 blocks to downtown Dublin, it was a lovely walk beside St. Stephen's Green and the Georgian townhomes.  The neighborhood around the hotel is also lovely and don't miss the opportunity to peruse and eat at the local establishments.",5,2016,01,05
248,Christmas Break,"Friendly welcome. Visited during peak time. Check in fine. Were given room on 5th floor, room was down a long, bland corridor and there were discarded breakfast trays lying outside a number of rooms at 6pm! Room itself was nice, quite small but clean and modern. Breakfast was very good and there was an excellent variety to chose from. At check out the next day the queue was about 50 people deep. More staff would be useful to ease this wait time at peak periods. The stay was fine but I would not rate this as a 4* hotel..it is more of an average 3*",4,2016,01,05
248,Fab,"I've stayed at this hotel on a number of occassions and it never fails to disappoint. Friendly staff, outstanding breakfasts, smart TV's (a new addition). Clean rooms with Orla Kiely products on hand. Relaxing pool & jacuzzi where on this trip my now fiance proposed. We'll always go back to the Camden Court - especially now 😀",5,2016,01,05
248,weekend break,"Great hotel surpassed our expectations for the money paid, staff were excellent food good. Room was very good and the bed was so comfortable encouraged my wife and I to go out and buy a memory foam topper on our return home. My wife suffered blisters on the soles of her feet and the receptionist could not have been more helpful, she sought out special cushioned plasters and I could not have been more thankful for her help. The location is ok if you are able to walk half a mile to the main areas of Dublin, we enjoyed the stroll in but anyone with difficulty walking may want to find a hotel nearer t0 0'connel street.
If flying into Dublin area there is a great shuttle bus service very cheap and regular don't be tempted to book expensive transport into the city.
The atmosphere in Dublin is amazing we will be back again soon.  The atmosphere was probably enhanced as it was the last weekend before Christmas.",4,2016,01,05
248,3 night stay in good hotel,"The hotel is walking distance to central shopping area of Grafton Street and Temple Bar.  Warm and welcome reception area, easy check in.  Room on 3rd floor, which was amazingly quiet considering we stayed over New Year's Eve.  Room itself was big, ventilated and clean.  Single beds were comfortable, except pillows were somewhat flat.  Bathroom was fine, with good shower and plenty of towels.  Only issue was the lack of extractor fan in bathroom.  Public areas were clean and fresh.  Restaurant was nice, but don't sit next to the fire (too hot).  Breakfast was extra expense, but well worth it.  Full Irish was exceptional, especially lovely puddings.

For a city centre hotel without views of anything special, it was very nice indeed, and will definitely stay there again.

By the way, we never made it as far as the leisure centre or swimming pool!  Next time!",4,2016,01,05
248,New Year break,"A very warm welcome awaits from this hotel, excellent food from the in house restaurant. A health club with a pool, jacuzzi, steam & sauna rooms also. We have had two nights here & thoroughly enjoyed our visit. If we return to Dublin again, we will definitely be coming back to stay. ",5,2016,01,01
248,A wonderful conclusion in Dublin,"Since our first night in Dublin was a bit of a disappointment, you cannot imagine our delight when we reached the Camden Court seven days later.  We were there only for one night, and had to leave incredibly early the next morning, but we enjoyed the hotel and would return.  This is a wonderful hotel, with friendly folks at the front desk, and friendly folks everywhere you turn.  The box breakfast we received early in the morning was more than ample.",4,2015,12,28
248,Great accommodations for a stay in Dublin,"After realizing a week before our vacation that the VRBO flat we *thought* we had booked for Dublin was not, in fact, confirmed (my own fault), we scrambled to come up with an alternate booking to ensure we had a place to stay at the end of our Irish holiday. We had looked at Camden Court Hotel early in our search, and felt that its location would be ideal from which to explore Dublin on foot, and the rate was reasonable. What sealed the deal, however, was the fact that our daughter was named Camden, and we felt it would be funny to stay at a hotel bearing her name.

Our stay at Camden Court was perfect in nearly every regard: the front desk staff were friendly and accommodating, the lobby clean and spacious, and our room was spotless as well. For our family of three, the family room (one double/one single) was perfect for our needs. We didn't eat at the onsite restaurant or bar during our visit, but my wife and daughter spent an hour or so in the pool one evening and reportedly had a fine time.

While not directly in the heart of Dublin on Grafton Street or within a block of the river, the hotel's location was well-suited for exploring the area, and it took just a brisk 10-minute walk to get into the heart of the city and start our days' explorations. On our final day we found a stop at a local bagel shop and a stroll through Iveagh Gardens and St. Stephens Green while munching our food a great end to our lovely stay in Dublin.",5,2015,12,28
248,"Comfortable, great staff","We've just had a really great 3 days at the Camden Court just before Christmas. We arrived at 11am but were allowed to check in to our rooms. No complaints at all. The rooms were good sizes, warm and with comfortable beds. Lighting was well thought out. Large TV with cable channels and Netflix. Great shower. The buffet breakfast was superb and good value at €13. We also tried the bar food on one of our evening. Not haute cuisine but certainly enjoyable. And all of the staff were very friendly and helpful. Despite the hotel closing at 12 noon for Christmas, we were allowed to keep our bags there until collection at 3pm later in the day. Thanks!!",5,2015,12,23
248,Amazing ,Great for a 4 star hotel. Breakfast is amazing! And reasonably priced. Comfy beds and clean rooms. Staff are helpful and great wifi connection. Not the most luxurious hotel but perfect for a top city break. Bar is great for a quick lunchtime snack before heading out again. ,5,2015,12,20
248,Comfortable hotel in central location,We had a standard double room... a bit on the small side but comfortable and well equipped. Buffet breakfast was good and staff friendly and helpful. We have stayed here before and will go back again.,4,2015,12,15
248,location location location,"The Camden Court Hotel is centrally-located in Dublin - every store, pub, restaurant, visitor attraction is accessible from this hotel no matter what direction you go exiting the hotel. This hotel is large, modern, clean and roomy, a lovely reception/restaurant area and quick elevators. The hospitality is first-class from all hotel employees. In addition, one of the oldest pubs accessible walking out the hotel front door and walking five footsteps into the Bleeding Horse which serves a great pint and good food.",5,2015,12,15
248,Comfy Central Dublin hotel,"Visiting Dublin for work, so stayed in the Camden as its very central and great for pipping out for a few drinks. Pool fairly standard for hotel, didn't try restaurant or gym. Pub built into the hotel also worth a visit",5,2015,12,14
248,Great hotel,"Everything about this hotel is great, location perfect for the luas/tram and close enough to the main shopping area  if you want that. The hotel is lovely with a nice bar and good restaurant. Room was small but cosy and more importantly it was quiet so got a good sleep. Will stay here again.",5,2015,12,11
248,Overnight stay & Christmas party,"Great hotel just a few minutes walk from St Stephens Green, nice bar & restaurant with leisure facilities in the basement. Bleeding Horse bar next door shows all sky sports.
Great breakfast.
Christmas party nite , food & entertainment very enjoyable",4,2015,12,09
248,Enjoyed the stay,"We were here for two nights at the end of a driving tour of Ireland. It was easy to strike out on foot and find good restaurants, Grafton Street shopping, and our young son loved St. Stephens Green. The staff was very helpful and we liked the rooms. There was a power outage in one room, but it was shortly before we checked out and we had adjoining rooms, so it didn't inconvenience us much. Oh, and having the Bleeding Horse pub next door is nice, too!",4,2015,12,08
248,Warm Welcome,Upon arriving from the blustery Irish wind we received a very friendly welcome. We didn't use many of the hotels facilities as we wanted to get out and explore Dublin but the room was very classy and immaculate throughout. We intend to return to Dublin and will be using this hotel again.,5,2015,12,07
248,great location,"We thought that this hotel was very pretty.  It had a great lobby with comfy seating.  The rooms were perfect for us as we had two rooms.  We had a triple for our three kids which was a nice size room for them.  Our room was small but very nice.

The only complaint I would have is that you can't regulate the room temperature.  I prefer it to be chilly when I am sleeping.  Opening up the window wasn't an option and believe me, we tried.  It was loud with late-night bar activity going on.

We thought the breakfast was good.  On a Friday night, we were foolish to think we could just walk into any restaurant without reservations. After wandering around the streets of Dublin, we circled back to our hotel and had a delicious meal there.  I had the fish and chips and it was perfect.

I would recommend this hotel for sure.",4,2015,12,06
248,One of the best buffet breakfasts,The hotel was modern and comfortable and spotlessly clean. The staff are friendly and the location is good; close to Grafton Street and Stephens Green. The best part of our stay was the breakfast in the morning. Lots of options for both cooked and continental breakfast. Bacon was amazing!! ,4,2015,12,04
248,"A comfortable, competent hotel near Dublin city centre","I think this hotel is supposed to be a four star. While it has all the facilities, including a decent size indoor swimming pool, it seems more old-style 4-star.
My wife's firm chose it because it claimed to have a business centre. That turned out to be a small, pokey room off the reception with one small desk, a PC and printer.  She elected to work in her room...
As with most people. we do not normally eat in hotel restaurants. More often than not, they are soulless and the food can be average and unimaginative. Because she need to stay close to her laptop, we ate twice in the hotel restaurant.  The food was very good.  We had fillet steak and it was first class. We were impressed and decided to eat again, after an interesting meal in a nearby Middle East/Lebanese restaurant. Although there is plenty of choice along the road, the hotel restaurant is definitely worth considering if you don't fancy the schlep of finding somewhere decent to eat. Also the breakfast buffet was very good.  Loads of choice, lovely Irish bacon and salmon. The black pudding tasted odd though.",4,2015,12,03
248,Modern but pricey,"Nicely renovated in the last couple of years and upgraded to 4* status as a result. I must have stayed here almost 100 times over the last 9/10 years, but I doubt I will be staying again. 

Location is good - about 10 minutes walk from Stephen's Green and on a Luas line. 

Plenty of amenities in the immediate vicinity (pubs, restaurants, cafes etc). 

Hotel has lost the run of itself with the price of the rooms. Now the rate doesn't even include parking. Breakfast was always dreadful so I no longer partake. 

Rooms are modern and comfortable but no amount of renovation warrants these prices for a room you have for less than 24hours. Truly disappointing.",3,2015,11,25
248,Modern style,Took a n.i. Rail break.  Very modern stylish hotel quite central 20 minute walk to main shopping areas.  Big bright room with fantastic large bed and very nice bathroom.  Bar food good as is breakfast in restaurant. Surrounding streets not great for food or entertainment though,4,2015,11,23
248,Stupid american can't find the light.,"First the good...Hotel room was clean,Spa & pool along with that staff was awesome.Dining room food was great,& that staff was awesome.There was a young blond woman with a french accent who took very good care of my sister & I & my food allergy.Now the bad... As an American in Europe for the first time I had no idea that in order to turn on the front hallway & bathroom lights you needed to insert your room key into the slot where the light switch should be.I called down to ask them,they sent up someone right away to show the Stupid American how the lights worked.I felt so stupid. I understand they do this to save on electrical energy however I wished they informed us of this at check in.Then one evening our hotel room door would not lock when we left our room.I tried several times to fix it but it still opened from the outside.We called downstairs,they sent someone right away.He knocked & my sister said ""come on in"" & he did with no key or problem-she then said ""see the issue?""He suggested that we stay in and lock the door from the inside.Seriously?? He giggled the lock & played with it for a while then he got it to work.And last but not least,our last day as we are checking out I said to the guy at reception so all I need to do now is pay the parking fee in the garage? He said ""yes madame."" So we leave pack up the car go to the kiosk only to find out we need to go back to the reception desk to pay the fee,ugh!!!  All in all 4 out of 5 stars",4,2015,11,22
248,Uninteresting bland hotel,"Soul-less, average hotel that will certainly not go down as a place I would recommend.

We rented a family room (husband and I and 2 of our kids)

The room was quite comfortable but incredibly warm despite ten radiator being turned off and opening the window was not an option because of the noise outside. 

But the biggest noise came at 7 the following morning (a Saturday) when the man in the room next door used the bathroom and had a shower. He might as well have been standing in the middle of our room since we heard everything and I will pass on the details, needless to say we got to hear the not-so finest details of his morning routine. By which time the kids had been highly entertained and were wide awake. 

We did complain at reception when checking out and got the blandest response one can possibly get. 

The hotel bar is as soul-less as the rest of the hotel, but thankfully the Bleeding Horse is right next door! 

",2,2015,11,22
248,Freezing,"Don't visit here in winter. It's 2 degrees outside and they don't put heating on till 6.30 pm. No apology from staff and not particularly sympathetic. I'm sat in my over coat in my room when I should be relaxing. Shame looks like a reasonable place otherwise. 
",1,2015,11,20
248,Nice hotel - excellent location,"Have stayed here on many occasions for business reasons. Have decided I should leave a review given the amount of time I have spent here.  To summarize the experience all I can say is for value for money this has to be one of the best value stays in Dublin. I have stayed at far nicer hotels but this one ticks many boxes both for business travelers but also for tourists I should imagine.

Its on the edge of a nice area of Dublin (near St Stephens Green,Harcourt st.,Grafton St) and is next to a nice enough pub (The Bleeding Horse - a bit of a Dublin landmark)

Whilst the rooms aren't massive they are clean and modern with good Tv, facilities etc.

Breakfast is great and as long as you are in a room away from the street side of the hotel is it very quiet and peaceful.  It has a gym with pool facilities so all in all it really ticks all boxes

I would recommend anyone who wants value and comfort while staying in Dublin to consider here.",4,2015,11,19
248,Nice hotel but restaurant is poor value for money,The Camden Court Hotel is very comfortable to stay in for work purposes. It is centrally located with loads of great restaurants around and good access to transport. The room was very comfortable and quiet at night. The service was good. However I was very disappointed in the restaurant. The dish I ordered was very small and significantly overpriced. I raised this with staff and I was given extra potatoes. However it is poor value for money even in its location.,3,2015,11,17
248,noisy night,"stayed in room 413,across the corridor room #412 and adjacent room had some very noisy people ,party time @6am.rang reception to complain.no feed back ,on checking out [approx.10.30 am.Sun.8th.Nov]Asked the guy checking us out re our complaint which he knew nothing about, nothing logged.Guy on reception very understanding and apologetic saying Hotel would upgrade us on our next visit and comp.parking for the rest of the day.",3,2015,11,16
248,Your average 2-3 star hotel,"I stayed at the Camden Court in October 2015 for four nights total. I've given the hotel 2 stars, but really wanted to give 2.5 stars. I rounded it down because it sells itself as a 4-star hotel, so would expect more, regardless of price. 

Let's start with the positives:
- breakfast is good, the poached eggs (on request) are well made, the orange juice tastes fresh and the staff are helpful
- it has a gym and spa area (though I didn't have time to try the spa)
- the rooms facing the inner courtyard/parking are quiet
- the reception area is pleasant and there are some corners to meet with people
- it has free wifi (code is coffee)

The downsides though:
- the hotel seems to be stuck in the 90's. There's a drink vending machine on every floor, and no minibar in the rooms. The carpets are quite dingy.
- my room had a hole in the wall, filled with a piece of crumpled toilet paper (see picture)
- there were pencil marks on the wall, apparently from where some wardrobe/shelf had been planned (see picture)
- the carpet didn't fit, and had a piece the wrong size and cut out (see picture)
- there was mold on the grout in the shower
- the towels were frayed at the edges and in dire need or replacing
- paint was flaking off the walls, which had signs of having been repainted without stripping the previous grime (which was also apparent - see pictures)
- the room's sofa was ripped (see picture)
 -breakfast doesn't start until fairly late (7am), there was a small group of businessmen in the morning waiting for breakfast to start each day.
- the gym isn't open 24/7 (6:30 to 21:00 if memory serves - compared to the Hilton's 24/7 gym this was quite inconvenient)

So all in, this is a good 2 or 3-star hotel, but a pretty poor 4-star hotel when you look at the rooms and opening hours of the facilities.",2,2015,11,15
248,"Solid, Consistent, Hospitable","I had the pleasure of the Camden Court my hotel of choice in Dublin. Located at the edge of town...easy walking distance to the sights of Dublin and also to the LUAS. The staff always made me feel welcome there remembering small details that made the difference to my stay. The clientele are mostly tourists but not the loud and rowdy type which was the ideal balance for someone on a business trip wanting to escape the monotony of a business hotel but not suffer the repercussions of late night revelry in Dublin's enviable social scene.
They went the extra mile for me and I would like to thank all the staff (especially Dorian on Reception, the lovely night restaurant supervisor whose name is evading me and Mick and the boys in the well appointed gym/pool) for their banter, detail and hospitality. Well done. Particularly impressive was that I never once had a room key card fail in over 50 nights and a skilfully 'undisruptive' redecoration during summer. Only complaint...the shower head in the otherwise excellent bathroom was a bit low for my 6 foot 4 frame.
I tried a few hotels in Dublin before I settled on Camden Court and it was the right choice. If I head back to Dublin I will most certainly stay there and I will tell all my friends to do the same. Bravo guys, thank you. I will miss you (a bit). Richard.",5,2015,11,12
248,Good choice.,"I'm glad this hotel did a refurb a few years ago, as it's much more comfortable. Nice to see that they keep up with fresh paint, too.

Check-in was rather slow, but the staff was very friendly.

Our room was fine, with a comfortable bed and a choice of feather or non-feather pillows. The room had a safe.  Really, the only complaint is that both sides of the bed don't have power outlets, just one side, which isn't great when two people need to charge phones & devices at bedside.  A simple power hub on each nightstand would resolve this issue.

The bathroom had a shower/tub combo.  There was zero mold in the grout--excellent job, housekeeping!  The shower head was nice, water pressure good, and the hot water stayed hot.  The towels were decent.

The free WiFi was strong and worked well.  The hotel has some open-air parking.

As long as they keep this hotel in good shape, I'm always happy to return here each year.",4,2015,11,11
248,Really nice hotel.,"Stayed at the Camden Court for one night on Saturday 7th November, Hotel was very nice, pool and spa were fantastic, especially the jacuzzi!! shame about the location wasn;t really sure where to head when we left the Hotel, 
Room was very nice with the bed being comfiest i've ever slept in, although the Kettle and hairdryer could do with updating as very old, would expect more from hotel of that class. Also no Air Con room was roasting.",4,2015,11,10
248,Excellent hotel on all levels,"Just had a great stay here. lovely hotel in great location. Far enough to get away from hustle and bustle but near enough to walk to nearby attractions.
The hotel was clean and room was immaculate and comfortable. Black out curtains a blessing after a night on the town in Dublin.
We ate breakfast twice and dinner twice here, all 4 meals were superb and great in price.
We arrived back from the pubs at nearly 5am and the bar was still open and serving....not loud enough o disturb guest sleeping though.
Reception staff were speedy and knowledgeable about the area. more than happy to order taxis for you whenever needed.
This would be my first choice in hotel when I return to Dublin",5,2015,11,09
248,Weekend away,"My wife and I stayed for my birthday and chose a nice 4* hotel.
Arrived around 12.30 and were checked in no problem.
Plenty of facilities ie gym,pool etc.
Nice bar serving food most of the day and onsite restaurant.
Staff were courteous and helpful throughout our stay.
Absolutely no complaints and the smart TV in our room was a nice bonus too.",4,2015,11,08
248,Girls weekend away .....,"We had a girlie weekend over Halloween and there were 8 of us.
We all got twin rooms on the second floor which were very nice.
Our view was over a courtyard so nice and quiet.
The others had street views which can be noisy.
We checked in about 10.30 am on the Friday and luckily
all our rooms were ready.
Hotel staff all very friendly from reception to dining, saying that we 
only stayed for breakfast and ate out the rest of the time.
You can either walk to the shopping district or get a Luas which is
cheap if you thought it was too far,  we walked to the shops and 
got the Luas back.
Rooms lovely and very tidy, towels changed every day.
Breakfast very nice and lots of it.
A taxi from Connelly Station cost us just over 11 Euro going to the Hotel 
on the Friday, and return journey on the Sunday afternoon was just over
17 Euro.
We tried getting the Wifi but it wouldnt work for us unfortunately.
We all had a great time.",4,2015,11,07
248,Bar food disappointing,I popped in for food after work and missed the restaurant as it closes at 6 and went to bar which is nice but had fish and chips.  The cops were done and enough of them but the fish must have been miniscule without the batter which was much too thick and heavy.  So the main part of the meal was chips and batter which was very disappointing.  I am always happy with the restaurant food but won't be using the bar again,1,2015,11,02
248,Very good hotel for work or pleasure,"Stayed here for a couple of days  on business in October 2015. Great location for picking up the tram to Dundrum and also plenty of restaurants and pubs nearby. 

The hotel was well appointed and my room was very comfortable. Good selection of food for breakfast. I also made use of the gym, which was limited in equipment and quickly got busy after 7am - but definitely served its purpose. 

A good hotel that I'd recommend. 
",4,2015,11,02
248,Good hotel near the city centre,"Stayed 3 nights in October, and was not impressed. The location is ok, a short walk to the city centre, where you can shop until you drop (and a little bit more). But I would have found something more close to the city centre if my main goal was shopping. 

The wi fi in my room did not work, and since I was there for business it made it difficult to work in my room. But the room was clean and large, and the bed was very comfy. The hotel was in a silent area, so there was not much noise of people or traffic. 

We ate lunch at the hotel once, and it was boring, the same goes for breakfast. I did not find anything to eat that was more than ok. But it was easy to find a spot, and the personal was very friendly and serviceminded. So all in all it was ok, and I'm not afraid to stay here again on another trip.",3,2015,11,01
248,Absolutely perfect ,"Just returned from this hotel for a 3 night stay with my wife. 

They were aware we had just got married and were greeted by a lovely gentleman who congratulated us and advised us about our room. We were having a bit trouble connecting to the free wifi which he sorted for us. The wifi is good and has a great connection wherever you are in the hotel. 

The room was absolutely lovely, it was large, bright and clean. Had a huge double bed a sofa bed also a table and chair! Everything you would want is in the room. A hairdryer, toiletries and a massive smart TV. 

The lesuire centre was good too. This was a  nice pool with a Jacuzzi, steam room a sauna. Also a gym (didn't use the gym) it was all clean and towels were provided for guests.

Breakfast was lovely there was a choice of full English and toast, cereal, fruit you name it they had it. Great.

The bar was really good too, we were constantly pestering the bar staff for cocktails which they knocked up with no fuss. They were delicious. Great prices too especially for a hotel! The bar staff are a credit to the hotel - friendly and happy to help. 

I could honestly go on about this hotel for ages. We loved it and will recommend it to family who are going to Dublin next year. We will be back too of course that is a certainty 

Thanks for making our trip special ",5,2015,10,29
248,"Comfortable, well priced, good location ","I enjoyed my stay. My room was spacious, quiet and had everything I needed. The leisure centre is great, a bit dated but a sized pool for a hotel, and good extras including jacuzzi, steam room and sauna. Wish I'd had more time there to relax. Staff were friendly and helpful too. I'll go back again. ",4,2015,10,27
248,Good hotel; good location.,"Spent 4 nights with a Road Scholar tour group.
Reception by staff was mixed; male attendant rather rude while a female attendant was very gracious and helpful.
Had 4 acceptable, buffet breakfasts and 1 dinner which was quite acceptable.
Good bar; fine selection of draft beer and Irish whisky (although they did not stock Red Breast which I was looking forward to sampling and had to find elsewhere).
The hotel is short walks to either St. Stephen Park and/or Trinity College and a little further (although doable) to Temple Bar area.",4,2015,10,27
248,Great Hotel in walking distance of Dublin,We had a great stay at the Camden Court Hotel. Accommodation were very nice with excellence staff that was very helpful.  The hotel is in walking distance from all the attractions in Dublin. I would return again.,4,2015,10,27
248,Great hotel central location ,Stay here almost weekly.  Great location. Near St Stephens Green.  Lovely staff. Very clean. Bar menu is nice but would be nice to see more healthy options on it. All in all a great place to stay.  Gym is on basement.  Very warm. ,5,2015,10,26
248,Lovely,"I stayed five nights. The chef in the restaurant mate vegan food for me with no notice. I was allowed to keep vegan food in the fridge. The staff were awesome. 

The room was clean and comfy. 

Only one downside, there was no AC and the street was so noisy it was ridiculous. 

I would stay here again though! ",4,2015,10,21
248,Great location ,"Great hotel, very clean, modern, first class staff. Private car park in the city. Reasonably priced and everything you could want is on your doorstep. Couldn't find fault to be honest. Can't recommend it enough. ",5,2015,10,19
248,EVERYTHING YOU COULD ASK FOR,"Rooms were big and airy,fantastic breakfast,dinner in the bar fab very reasonable,staff great.nice leisure center,close to night life and main attractions.Decor very stylish.Nice large recieption area pleanty of room to read a newspaper or unwind with a glass of wine after shopping",5,2015,10,16
248,Great Hotel,"Great feel to Hotel, with lovely decor and the Staff all friendly. Stayed with a group of friends and all enjoyed the stay. The Hotel is located about a 10 Walk from top of Grafton St, so ideal as close without being in the middle of all the hustle and bustle of Dublin. The odd slight moan is if your are to the rear of the Hotel, our room was close to the bottle bin, so when they emptied the bottles it was a little noisy. ",5,2015,10,14
248,Location OK,Our room was facing the smoking area and noise from there in the early morning hours was just horrendious.  Also commotions and yelling in the corridors disrupted our sleep.Otherwise the breakfast was ok. The staff was friendly.,4,2015,10,13
248,Nice location.,"The Camden Court was a little difficult to find - the signage is on the side of the building not on the street like an American hotel might be. The room was comfortable and clean. Everything was in good order. There is not air conditioning so we did leave the window open. The street is reasonably close to city centre and even the Temple Bar area. If I were going to stay in Dublin again, this would be a first choice. Parking is an additional $10. per night. If you don't have to drive in Dublin, DON'T! Take a cab to the hotel from the airport, a cab back to pick up a rental car when you are ready to leave Dublin for other parts of Ireland. Driving in Dublin is a little Crazy! Dublin is a city of 1.4 million so with taxis, horsedrawn carriages, motorcycles, city buses, tour buses, bicycles, and the ""ducky"" driving can be treacherous. Camden Court was a good value for the money.",4,2015,10,09
248,Perfect hotel for a night out in Dublin.,"Wasn't expecting too much but was pleasantly surprised. Excellent value for a one night stay in Dublin. Not fancy but clean, comfortable, ideally located and perfect as a base. Staff were friendly and helpful and the breakfast was not bad either. And it has a pool! Will definitely be back.",4,2015,10,03
248,Excellent  Hotel,"Fantastic hotel with great friendly staff. Stayed one night when visiting Dublin to watch Riverdance.

Rooms were immaculate and a brilliant breakfast selection was available. Taxis always available to and from the hotel.",5,2015,10,01
248,"Good breakfast, excellent fitness centre","The hotel is on the southern edge of Dublin, comfortable walking distance to most places. There is a sumptuous morning breakfast and a remarkably good fitness centre, with pool, jacuzzi, sauna and steam room.",5,2015,09,30
248,day in Dublin,"Great overnight stay hotel has large rooms clean huge kingsize beds , massive mirrors huge smart t.v excellent bathroom and shower , they even supply face cloths .food good , dissapointing that you cant help yourself at breakfast",5,2015,09,28
248,Excellent ,I stayed in the Camden Court hotel on a Tuesday and Wed night. It is a fantastic hotel and ideal location. The parking onsite is a bonus as I don't know of any other city centre hotel who give you free parking. I've already booked it for next month. Excellent hotel. ,5,2015,09,25
248,Location on point ,"The location of this hotel was a huge factor in booking, now having been it's a factor but the hotel is so nice and helpful I won't look elsewhere for Dublin trips. Hotel staff are so helpful and polite, we had a slight hic up with how many people we booked in but it was cleared up I n seconds with no drama.  Underground parking is a saviour and cheap,  left my car there the following day to explore Dublin.  Rooms are spotless and modern and inviting. I'll be back ",5,2015,09,25
248,Great place to recover from jet lag,"The location was close to shopping and Trinity College. After getting a nap,we were able to walk everywhere including the downtown Hertz car rental site. The staff was really helpful with directions and local attractions.",5,2015,09,22
248,Great location & secure private parking,"Stayed for one night room only. Cannot fault the cleanliness of the room and hotel. Lovely large reception / lobby area with lots of seats tables and a large TV.  The staff at reception were a little cold and not that friendly.

Ate in the bar in the hotel. Laura the girl who took the order and served me was lovely, friendly and professional! Food was very tasty, simple yet good.

The hotel has a large underground secure private car park. It's 10 to park your car and as hotels in and around that area go its v diff to find any with parking so this is defiantly a plus. 

I would def stay here again.

",5,2015,09,21
248,Nice touch with the flowers,"We decided on Dublin for a short break to celebrate our 20th Wedding Anniversary, staying Saturday to Wednesday with the big event on the Monday.  I rang ahead asking for some flowers to be put in the room on the Monday.  When we got there, a big bouquet of flowers was already in the room with a 'Happy Anniversary' card.  Initially a bit miffed that they got the date wrong, my wife was overjoyed with them, so I was happy.  But when we got back from our tripod on Monday, another bouquet was there - two in all!  Even happier wife, even more confused me.  But when we checked out - only charged for one bouquet - one must have been a gift from the hotel.  A very nice, and much appreciated thought.
The hotel itself is about a 15 pr 20 minute walk out of the centre of Dublin on the south side.  But the walk in and out is very interesting because of the number of bars, pubs and restaurants you walk past.
To be honest we only used the restaurent in the hotel for breakfast, either full Irish /English or continental was available - all very good.  We didn't use any of the other facilities in the hotel.  The room itself was spotless; no intrusive noise and a very comfortable bed.
All in all - recommended.",5,2015,09,13
248,2 night stay,A clean and welcolming hotel could not fault rooms clean staff polite food excellent.A good destination if wanting some where to stay in Dublin a good place to explore Dublin from.We only had 2 nights here but what a pleasure wish we had got more time to stay but would give this hotel 10 out 10,5,2015,09,13
248,"perfect location, friendly people","great hotel. really well located - not right in the middle of the noise and excitement of the city but just on the outskirts. perfect as everything is in walking distance. 

only points for improvement would be the lighting in the bathroom as its a bit dim. not good for applying makeup etc... and robes and slippers.

other than this the spa, restaurant, reception area and rooms are lovely!",4,2015,09,10
248,Camden Court Hotel,"Great location, public areas were wonderful, lobby, dining areas, pool, etc. Rooms are very dated and there was no clock in the room and extremely poor lighting.

The staff was outstanding and could not do enough for us during our week with them. The food was excellent and the buffet breakfast was nicely presented.",4,2015,09,09
248,Great Breakfast,Was booked in mid-week on a corporate rate.  Was a 30 euro taxi ride from the airport and a little further from the centre than I wanted but the hotel amenities and pubs and restaurants locally were good.  A little noisy at night with banging doors and early risers but the room was large well furnished and clean.  My room overlooked the rear reception entrance so there was a flow of traffic at night which interrupted me further but otherwise enjoyed my brief stay.  Breakfast was the star of the show with generous selections of most things and a buffet served by the chef - the carved bacon was gorgeous.  Would definitely stay again.,4,2015,09,09
248,Great location and convenient to Stephens Green.,"This is a typical ""business"" hotel and while it has everything you would want, avoid the bar for your after work pint. Staff are friendly, food is as expected and satisfactory but not restaurant standard. There are good restaurants and bars nearby.You will return as it is central, clean and good value. I do like this hotel and so will you. Luas is nearby, less than 100mtrs from the hotel.I have stayed on business and on pleasure trips to Dublin.",3,2015,09,08
248,Good location but not 4 star!,"We stayed at the Camden Court hotel for 2 nights. It was a busy weekend in Dublin, so cost approximately 400euro for the 2 nights including the 10euro per night parking charge... Breakfast was not included in this rate. The hotel has an excellent location, close to Luas and bus connections and within walking distance of nightlife etc. The staff were friendly on checking in and out. The pool, jacuzzi, steam room and sauna were lovely. The room was clean, bed very comfy but some aspects were not 4 star standard... The room did not have a fridge, or air conditioning and the toiletries were not replenished when our room was made up. A bit disappointing when paying 400euro for 2 nights...! ",3,2015,09,07
248,Not everything that Glitters is gold,"The hotel is nice and clean.  Breakfast is not included in the room rate, you can pay for it, but that seems normal for the British Isles. The staff are nice but you don't get the welcoming feeling.  They must also all be from out of town, because not one of them knows anything about the neighborhood. The rooms are spacious and clean, but the walls might as well be made of paper - you are awakened by people walking in the hallway or the guy taking a shower in the next room.The hotel provides breakfast to tour groups as well. However, this is done at the same time that breakfast is offered to the hotel guests. So breakfast is always a hectic time - there is always a new bus load of noisy strangers at breakfast. .",3,2015,09,05
248,Well located classy hotell,"Great food ,excellent ambience and wonderful Irish staff except that many of the European staff were cold and unfriendly by comparison
The food was exceptionally good and varied and available in several locations throughout the day.
The location was central and picturesque - old Georgian Dublin surroundings and the World famous pub the Bleeding Horse right next door.
The spa was top class with a lovely pool which my grandchildren enjoyed and incidentally the hotel was child friendly. 
The rooms were comfortable and modern with all amenities.
Thr only problem was negotiating the one way streets that have occured since the tram car system was installed  but walking in and around the city from the hotelwas easy with access to all forms of transport (we even got a horse drawn carriage from St Stephens Green- a ten minutes walk  to take us home my grandchildren were thrilled.)",5,2015,09,04
248,We had a great trip in Dublin,Spent two nights in Dublin and we really enjoyed ourselves. We travelled from Belfast and was about 15min taxi from the train station. The hotel was quite private and very lovely. The spa facilities were clean and bigger than most i have been to in hotels. The rooms were lovely. Staff were very polite and helpful. The breakfast was very nice too and had a variety to choose from. Probably a 5/10min walk straight down to temple bar. Overall it was a lovely hotel and we had a great weekend away. ,5,2015,09,02
248,Great Hotel,"A very nice hotel, convenient to Dublin Centre with good bus, luas links and can be an easy 15 min walk to Temple Bar and other areas in Dublin. The room was clean, tidy and with good facilities and a cracking Smart TV. The main lobby of the hotel was a great place to meet up with friends or just to sit, relax and have a drink and read the paper. The staff were friendly and very helpful and great sorting out taxis and checking in and out were a breeze. Breakfast had a wide range to choose from, from the full cooked to a continental breakfast the choice was yours.  Friends used the leisure facilities and thought they were very good. Would definitely recommend anyone to use the Camden Court Hotel and I certainly would go back the next time i'm in Dublin.",4,2015,09,01
248,What could have been a pleasant family stay was ruined by bad staff,"1. My reservation was for an ""executive family room"" to sleep my family of 5. I made this reservation via the phone as I was unable to determine which room on your website would be the best for my family. I was under the impression that the room I ordered was the one that included a a fridge, a microwave, toys and wooden flooring etc. I was pretty stunned when I discovered that we had instead been booked into 458 which was nothing more than a normal room where a chest of drawers had been removed to add an additional uncomfortable convertible bed. I cannot understand why you would label this as ""executive"", it was cramped and uncomfortable. When I spoke to the desk staff about my disappointment I was treated with disrespect by the manager on duty (tall man with a goatee/beard). When I enquired about the correct title for the room I was interested in he referred to it as a package, not a room and when I ask for upgrade options for my 8 night stay such as adjoining rooms he retorted that the rate would be much higher rather than answering my query for an upgrade. I assure you I was willing and able to pay for an upgrade given the length of our stay and the dissatisfaction of the room. Not a good start. Given that everyone was tired we returned to the room and elected to stay at the hotel rather than move to another hotel.

2. Given the lack of services in the room in contrast to what we expected, we asked for a fridge, a fan, some toys and a microwave to be brought to the room. Housekeeping very quickly brought us the fan and the fridge. I am grateful for that.

3. On the second night of our stay the phone began ringing shortly after we all feel asleep (10.30?). I was unable to get to the phone before the caller hung up but my family had been awoken none the less. About 15 minutes later, the children had gotten back to sleep when the phone rang again. This time I answered in time to speak to the caller. I was furious about the disruption and assumed it would be a prank caller from another room. I firmly (rudely) told the caller to not call again and then unplugged the phone. Since I was now awake it occurred to m that I should report the disruption to the front desk, especially in case this was a prank caller and many other guests would be disrupted through the night. At the desk the agent looked up my room but would not give me an answer about who had called until the manager came over. The same manager as the night before announced that the call was from his staff in the bar, that is was a mistake. NO APOLOGY was offered, he stared blankly at me as though I was in the wrong for being upset. Despite my significant rage I chose to not scream and returned to my room. I resolved to not buy anything at the hotel, not a coffee, a drink or a meal.

4. The hotel is located within the city center and I had some expectations of the room being noisy, both from traffic and revelers. I was very impressed with the sound deadening effect of the double window and double curtain installation. with both windows closed the hotel was no noisier than any other shared structure. The only significant noises we heard were from within the building (plumbing, lifts, people etc). 

5. Airflow in the hotel is extremely limited. There is no air condition system in the rooms so the only way to get any fresh air is from the window. During the day we left the window open but at night we needed it to be closed to ensure a quiet night of sleep. The fan we requested from house keeping was helpful.

6. Temperature control. We were at the hotel when the weather was cool. So there was little issue wrt the lack of air conditioning for cooling but I feel like I would hate to be there if the was pleasant sunshine. Although the heating was not enabled several times we heard water rushing through the radiators. This was very loud and I imagine it would be a significant issue if staying in the winter

7. Pool facilities are above average in my opinion. The locker rooms are a bit shabby and I regretted not having flip-flops to protect my feet from a very wet and somewhat dirty floor.

8. The house keeping staff were very polite and did a nice job preparing our room each day. Oddly the room (for 5) came with only 2 towels. 

9. Aside from the one front desk manager who I found to be rude and unprofessional there were a couple of front desk employees who I encountered who were friendly and helpful. I believe one man was named John; he took care about his work and was very helpful when we needed assistance finding a laundry that was open late on Saturday.",2,2015,09,01
248,Short break away,"Stayed here two nights before we arrived i emailed to request a fridge which we got very helpful staff, breakfast is lovely plenty to choose and the swimming pool is great, the only problem we had was there is no heat turned on in the rooms in the summer, i went down and spoke to manager and was told its summer time got a heater put in so if u are a cold person like me then u need to ask for a heater are u will be very cold other than that we had a great stay and will return again.",4,2015,09,01
248,Convenient and to the point,"Very straightforward service in a very convenient location to wander around Dublin, both during the day and also at night.
Rooms are not too small and well furnished, even if bathroom was a tad too small.
I would certainly stay here again!
Also there's a tight control of the hotel access at night so I felt really safe!",4,2015,08,31
248,Great hotel ,"Very nice hotel close to Dublin city centre. The room was excellent....big comfy bed, large smart TV and clean modern bathroom. Unfortunately we were only here for one night so didn't get to try the leisure facilities or restaurant. Would definitely stay again! ",4,2015,08,31
248,Perfect bargain,All you could need from a hotel in dublin. Reasonably priced. Rooms lovely. Good breakfast. Nice bar. Helpful staff. The staff were great at sorting taxis for my disabled dad. It's a pretty big hotel and situated in Camden and at the top of Harcourt Street.  Surrounded by great night life. Noise from street doesn't carry into hotel.,4,2015,08,31
248,Super hotel,"Wonderful hotel just outside the city center but only one one tram stop from st Stephen's Green. Rooms are very clean, comfortable and spacious. Staff are efficient friendly and helpful. Food in Bistro is good with a reasonable selection available. Restaurant was very quiet at night but food was excellent and reasonably priced. Breakfast is buffet style with a wonderful selection of well cooked food. Great base for exploring Dublin. I would definitely use this hotel again.",5,2015,08,31
248,One of the best hotels in Dublin,"I stayed here when I was attending a concert in the Music Hall. I had a room in the sixth floor. The room was lovely, very nicely decorated and clean. It was not noisy and I had a good sleep. I ate in the bar, there was a nice selection available. The staff were helpful and efficient. Breakfast the next morning was of a high quality. Lots of great facilities available also in the hotel.",4,2015,08,30
248,Great hotel to discover Dublin,"Lovely hotel a little out of the city center but an easy 10 minute walk in. Hotel was very clean, and the room had a lovely big bed. The gym had lots of equipment but the pool was a little small when families were around. We found the staff friendly but at breakfast it took a little time to get our drinks served. We visited the Bleeding Horse pub right next to the hotel and found the food reasonably priced and very tasty For a fun filled Irish music evening walk one minute on down Camden Street to a pub called Cassidys Bar, what a brilliant evening!! We stayed for 3 nights and would recommend it as a base to explore. ",4,2015,08,30
248,Over night stay,"Friendly and efficient Reception. Fantastic large bedroom overlooking Camden Street on fifth floor with large King size bed, . Very clean and well presented room. Good choice of dinner menu and prompt service. Breakfast excellent self service with wide variety of choice hot and cold. Attentive service. Very good location for shopping and other central Dublin attractions. Very quiet despite being on a heavy traffic street with good access to buses.",4,2015,08,29
248,Dublin Hotel,"We enjoyed our stay the staff were very helpful, we had a good breakfast each morning with plenty of choice. Our only problem was finding the hotel from the airport. Possibly if the hotel forwarded the directions before our journey that would have been helpful as the one way systems and closed roads in the city were horrendous. ",4,2015,08,28
248,Sight seeing,"Excellent place loved it, was recommended by a friend, very clean and central to everthing, food staff couldn't fault,pool jaquizzi steam room lovley, didn't use gym as didn't have time, going to book again for next year,",5,2015,08,28
248,Very good hotel ,"The hotel is clean , modern, good facilities. Great location. Room was spot on. Ordered room service twice. First time grand. Second time under cooked cold  pizza and a Thai coconut curry although nice was not a Thai coconut curry. 
Breakfast was delicious, plenty to choose from , would definitely return. ",4,2015,08,27
248,Decent Hotel for a short business trip,Slightly tired hotel. Staff try very hard to provide a good service. Wifi is free but good do with an upgrade. For what you pay it is good value. In the summer tends to have lots of coach parties of American tourists.   ,4,2015,08,27
248,Consistently good,"Have stayed here many times simply because its inexpensive,it's close to centre,has family rooms,is near Luas stop and best of all it has a pool.The rooms are well kitted out including Smart TV's and whilst they are a good size they are very warm as no air con and fans are provided for those that need them.The breakfasts are wondrous and a first class range on offer.Can get busy at breakfast time as lots of coach parties and business folk stay here.",4,2015,08,25
248,A relaxing break in Dublin!,"I was recently treated by my better half to a 2 night break in The Camden Court Hotel in Dublin. We travelled to Dublin by car so it was handy that the hotel had an underground carpark available, although this cost an extra €10 per night to use. Exteriorly, the hotel is tidy but directly beside a busy road. Check in was quick and easy and we were directed to our room on the 3rd floor by the helpful staff.

The hotel has a lift which we never had to wait very long on. The room itself was very clean, spacious and quiet. The bed was large and comfortable. Most impressively was the very large smart TV in the room which had all the normal local channels plus Netflix. The decor was tasteful however the room and bathroom, in my opinion, had too many mirrors! There were mirrors on nearly every wall, perhaps ideal for the vain amongst us! We availed of the tea/coffee making facilities and ironing facility. Wifi is available throughout the hotel, including the rooms and is fast and most importantly, free!

The hotel offers a good sized swimming pool, jacuzzi, sauna and steam room however you should be aware that no lifeguard is on duty. The breakfast is served until a respectable 11.00am at weekends and 10.30am on weekdays. The breakfast variety is good with fruit, pastries, cereals and the usual sausage, bacon, egg etc to name a few. The food is of good quality with hot foods served by a chef and plenty of waiting staff to serve tea/coffee. 

The reception staff were very helpful in advising us the best means of transport to get to Dublin Zoo/Guinness Storehouse (which is taxi incase you were wondering) and taxi's pass by the hotel doors regularly so it isn't too difficult to grab one fairly quickly. The hotel is approximately a 15 minute walk from the Temple Bar area so it's in a fairly good location for the nightlife and also has many fantastic restaurants close by. I did not dine in the hotel restaurant for dinner so I cannot comment on the quality of this. 

In terms of value for money, I believe the break cost in the region of €410 for 2 nights B&B and parking which seems fairly average for a 4 star hotel in Dublin. We certainly enjoyed our stay at The Camden Court and I too would recommend staying here if you are considering a break in Dublin!",4,2015,08,24
248,Happy Ladies! ideal location and friendly hotel.,"Stayed for three nights. Informative reception staff, supplying maps , ensuring we were aware of major points of interest, e.g. Temple bar, nearby parks and city centre shops. Room  (twin) was spacious providing everything we could wish for and more.  Supplying iron with ironing board, large bathroom with bath and tea and coffee facilities. Would highly recommend including the hotels breakfast with your stay. Great selection of food and drinks including freshly made juice, cereals, and continental breakfast. We decided to have a full english breakfast to start our busy day. We decided to walk into Dublin which took us 25 minutes. Would recommend visiting the cathedrals, Guinness, Jameson and also Olympia theatre to see 'once'. All the staff here are extremely friendly, including the cleaners and Eric in the sports centre. Thank you for a great and memorable stay. We will definitely return and will recommend to friends and family. The only concern we had was a couple of nights we returned late and found a sign on the front door to use the side entrance near the car park. We felt, two ladies, a little unsafe and would have preferred to have had access from the front entrance which was well light and on the main road.",5,2015,08,23
248,"Very nice hotel, ideal location","Myself and my wife have just had an overnight stay here. Cannot fault the hotel one bit. Location is perfect if you want to walk into City Centre, Luas stop just behind the hotel also for those who do not fancy walking. Only food we had in the hotel was our breakfast and that was lovely, buffet style with plenty of options. Plenty of car parking also both surface and underground. We had mentioned it was our anniversary so when we arrived we found a hand written note and 2 little packets of Butlers chocolates on our bed which was a lovely thought. Would definitely recommend staying here and I'm sure we will return again also",5,2015,08,17
248,THE CAMDON PLEASURE,"just got back from a short break for my birthday ,a excellent hotel clean really good food and spacious rooms the staff are brill and so friendly nothing to much trouble ,if you need any information reception no every thing,dublin is lovely with a excellent vibe,cant wait to come back will use same hotel but for longer dont book any were else.its only about 20mins walk to centre",5,2015,08,15
248,"Absolutely Fantastic, From Start to Finished,","Just back from A Fantastic 2 night stay at the Camden Court Hotel With My Fiancé & 3 Year Old Daughter, Everything was Perfect From Start to Finish, The Breakfast Is Up there With the Best, One of the Main reasons We Choose the Camden Was the Pool for Out Daughter with Its Central Location & It Didn't Disappoint. The Staff In the Leisure Centre Were Brilliant, throughout the Hotel No one ever passed her By without acknowledging her, the location is perfect with the secure parking always puts your mind at ease, looking forward to returning again for a break at Christmas, 5 Stars Throughout ***** ",5,2015,08,13
248,Leisure break for concert,This hotel is very good value.In relation to other reviews we found a deal and booked direct with hotel and asked for rooms overlooking inner courtyard which they obliged we had 2 rooms on the sixth floor. Rooms were very clean and modern although rooms have no air conditioning we slept well with window open and had any hardly noise even though it was the weekend. We booked with breakfast which was really good value has you could eat as much as you want. I would definitely stay here again. Short walk to centre.,4,2015,08,12
248,Camden court dublin,"I went on a solo trip, for a few days 
The hotel was what I expected from looking at it online. Esp the gym and swimming pool, and was a short distance from town centre. Overall I was happy and would recommend it to others

248,Bad attitudes/service,"Came to Dublin for a wedding. Spoiled by Barberstown Castle maybe, but hard to believe the general bad attitudes of the staff (except housekeeping). Not friendly, not helpful. Reception and restaurant hosts had a hard time understanding basic requests and seemed uninterested in truly helping.

Asked for a down pillow and they didn't know what it was. Tried to enter restaurant to look for family and treated like I was an intruder. No smiles, no warmth at all. Could take lessons in good service and hire people with personalities. 

Overpriced. Would never recommend. ",1,2015,08,09
248,Family stay,"Just stayed in the Camden Court Hotel for a night 
We love  this hotel and the facilities. Pool/gym great food from bar and restaurant 
We stay in this hotel every year at least twice a year and usually book direct with the hotel staff who are always pleasant and helpful 
We haven't stayed from last October and the only change is the car parking charge. While this is the norm for most hotels I think this hotel could have stayed different. They charge €3 per hour from time of check out and ten euro a night. The car park was not full on Friday or Saturday 
We returned from shopping on sat and was told that the charge from one o'clock to four was four hours or 12 euro. !! When I asked could I pay and then have a meal I was told I could only pay after the meal meaning a three euro charge for the privilege of dining in the hotel. A petty annoyance lol but it was enough for us to leave and dine on the road. 
I do hope to stay again but I will be checking around other hotels in Dublin. Something I have never done before 
",4,2015,08,09
248,great place to explore Dublin,There were 3 couples and we all had a great experience. Camden Court Hotel is centrally located in the heart of historic Dublin. There are many good restaurants nearby and we struck it rich with Green  Nineteen just a few blocks away. Most everything was close by and within walking distance. Great breakfast to start the day and the staff was great. If you are going to Dublin you should stay here.,5,2015,08,08
248,Wonderful,"This is a great, comfortable, conveniently located hotel. It is about a 10-minute walk to Stephen's Green. The price was considerably lower than the city center hotels, but the hotel is much nicer than many of them. There was a nice comfortable lobby for having tea and scones, drinks, or sandwiches, or to just sit and rest your feet after traipsing around the city all day. The breakfast was great! There was a wonderful selection of food served buffet style. We had the cold buffet and were very pleased with it. Amp,e food for everyone. There is a nice pub next door called The Bleeding Horse. We had a very good meal there one night. Highly recommend this hotel!",5,2015,08,08
248,Fantastic service all round,"Stayed here for two nights with my 15 year old son
Room was lovely ,clean and modern ( if not alittle too warm!)
We had breakfast on the two mornings and it was fantastic!!
What a amazing choice of food,so much to eat and all so lovely and fresh .
We ate in the bar on our last night  and again a fabulous meal and efficient service all round

Well done to all involved a super first class hotel 
",5,2015,08,05
248,Excellent,"Stayed 4 nights with wife and three kids. Excellent stay food was brilliant, excellent location, staff throughout the hotel were polite and very helpful which made our stay one of the best family hotel breaks we had. Just one point! When I booked I was not told that the family package only included an xbox etc in the room if you went for the upgraded deal which meant the kids who had brought their games were disappointed. It does not indicate this on the web site when you view the family room details.",5,2015,08,05
248,Almost perfect,"I stayed here twice once in May with for work and at the beginning of June for leisure. Almost perfect! 
The only let down was the leisure centre. First off I went to the gym on The Saturday morning of my first trip and there was no leisure attendant to be found! I didn't know whether I was supposed to sign in or what. Eventually a tall guy came wandering into the gym looking bewildered. The Gym was supposed to stay open until half 8. I went back to the gym to use the Sauna that evening at 10 to 8 and the gym was locked! On our second trip my boyfriend and I had a great chat with one of the trainers about nutrition and fitness. Her name was claire and she was perfectly happy for us to interrupt her floor mopping to give us tips. She also gave us advice on where to go for food that night. I am telling you she is so full of knowledge that girl; wasted on a gym like that. As we were leaving I was disgusted to hear the two guys working their, an older guy and the same tall guy making sexual comments about one of their members. My boyfriend, who is a regular weight lifter, also said he heard one of the trainers giving awful training tips to someone in the gym. If you are a gym bunny I suggest finding a different hotel because they are not professionals, apart from that one girl. 

Anyway... on to the positives. Generally the hotel was lovely. The restaurant was nice, bar staff were so attentive and the manager Blaithnaid was just an absolute gem! We would go back but we would advise anyone to avoid the leisure centre!!!",4,2015,08,05
248,Best hotel in dublin.,"Very few hotels in Dublin have a gym, pool and sauna. This hotel has all three for free. Excellent breakfast, very friendly staff who couldn't do enough for me and just a short walk to the city centre. I would have liked to have seen  a fridge in the room, especially as It was in the summer.",5,2015,08,02
248,Love this hotel,"This is the 2nd time we've stayed here.  The rooms are comfortable, clean and well appointed.  The breakfast is the best we had the whole trip.  The staff is always friendly and efficient.  The biggest bonus is that it is right next to The Bleeding Horse.  We always feel right at home at Camden Court.",5,2015,08,02
248,City Gem,"Located just outside the city centre but conveniently situated being just a ten minute walk to Grafton Street, our room was extremely clean and comfortable with a user friendly shower. The lounge area is vast with plenty of cosy seating. The restaurant staff served us an excellent meal under the direction of Nicoletta. We needed a really early breakfast in order to catch the ferry and chef put on the full menu of cooked and continental items.",5,2015,08,01
248,Good price for a decent four star hotel,"We collapsed into this hotel for 24 hours before a flight. Two of us had fluey bugs and we barely left the room so comments are limited! However, at 165 euros for a family room (including access to all the leisure facilities which looked great) it was a very reasonable price for Dublin. Room was spacious, smart TV and free wifi. Two out of three of us were delighted with the room service food: one less so. Staff universally helpful. Will come again and try to use more of the facilities next time!",4,2015,07,30
248,Very poor wifi for this type of hotel,Rooms are great and location is ok. Biggest problem is that the wifi is this hotel is not up to standard. Very unreliable connection. They also advertise the have smart-tv in the room but because of the weak wifi signal you can't use it. I couldn't connect to it and the hotel mananger wasn't very helpfull when i called to the lobby asking if there was a reason for it not working.,3,2015,07,30
248,Much more than we expected!,"This hotel was a real gem, from the friendly and helpful staff, the comfortable room and lounge and the restaurant. We only stayed one night but would recommend this hotel to anyone visiting Dublin. The staff in the restaurant were really lovely, and even though our group was leaving very early we were provided with a full breakfast menu, including cooked items. It was easy to get on the local tram and go into the centre of Dublin, although it is within walking distance. We would have liked to stay here longer!",5,2015,07,29
248,Just a Wonderful Hotel!,"We visited Dublin for a few days and stayed at this hotel. We arrived from the airport via shuttle and planned on the first few days just using the Hop on and Hop off buses to familiarize ourselves. The green shuttles have a pickup across the street for us at 9:50 am which was very convenient and we spent the rest of the day touring. The hotel has a fantastic buffet breakfast and the service was excellent. We dined out each evening but the hotel restaurant had a fabulous menu. It also has connected to it, two Pubs. The hotel rooms we had were comfortable and on the fifth floor. Despite being in the city, it was a quiet night sleep. The pool is wonderful should you decide to take a dip. We rented a car from Hertz before leaving town and it was just a short walk to get our car and begin our Ireland holiday. The hotel has parking should you arrive by car. The location is safe and nearby to St Stephens Green where the tour buses stop and you can return to the hotel by a short walk. The hotel staff were courteous and helpful and the housekeeping staff did a wonderful job of cleaning the rooms.",5,2015,07,29
248,"Good 3,5 star hotel","The hotel is about 15 minutes on foot to the main shopping streets or just 1 tram stop (tram at 3 mins. walking)
Nice spacious lobby.
Rooms was spacious and very good sound proof (2 double glazed windows), nice bathroom with bath tub. 
Decoration however is a bit out dated (brownish...) 
Very good choise of food at the breakfast, cold and warm buffet. Quality of the food was ok.
Overall just not a 4 star hotel, mainly due of the bit old colors and decoration.",3,2015,07,29
248,"Nice hotel, friendly staff","My husband and I plus another couple stayed here for 2 nights. We were in Dublin for the Ed Shearan concert.

Although this hotel wasn't our first choice, we are pleased that we ended up staying here. 

The location is fairy central (about a 10 min walk to most places) and is well equipped. There's a decent gym and a pleasant spa.

The rooms are nice - fairly standard 4 star but the staff are all really friendly and helpful and the breakfast is fab!

We will return with the children as its a hotel that's suitable for all. 

Helped to make the whole weekend great!",4,2015,07,29
248,Clean and elegant,"A very nice place to stay. Large lobby, friendly staff, clean rooms. A bit of a walk to places like the Temple Bar District, but very manageable. It was a little noisy...street noise at night. The staff were very friendly and helpful.",4,2015,07,27
248,Excellent hotel and. Restaurant,Room nicely decorated and clean.  Staff really friendly and the Iveagh restaurant is excellent.  We have had two lovely meals that have been cooked to perfection.  Short walk to main shopping centre through St Stephen Park. Loads of pubs and coffeehouses. ,5,2015,07,27
248,High quality hotel in above average location,"The room was clean and tidy and the service staff was helpful.  The location is out of the way of most of the major Dublin attractions.  Fortunately, there is a bus stop into the city center across the street and taxis in Dublin are not as expensive as American cities.  There are good restaurants including Camden Rotisserie and the Bleeding Horse.  The Bleeding Horse is a bar next door to the hotel.  This may be a bad thing for families, but the bar is generally pretty laid back and is not filled with crazy college kids.  I don't think families should let it be a big negative.",4,2015,07,26
248,Good business hotel near city centre,Tourist-class hotel that represents relatively good value for money as it has a swimming pool in the basement and the onsite restaurant isn't bad although the rooms are quite basic. Good location just on the edge of the city centre.,4,2015,07,26
248,Rooms are small but nicely furnished,"The lobby, restaurant and public spaces of this hotel are modern and comfortable. But the rooms, while very clean, are tight--we've had larger on cruise ships. It's a fair walk to downtown but we handled that.",3,2015,07,25
248,Weekend in Dublin ,"The hotel is nice and located around the corner from the luas which brings you directly to St. Stephens Green which is great. 
The only issue is I didn't sleep a wink due to noise from outside. It was awful!!!!!!",2,2015,07,24
248,"Very friendly staff, nice pool!","I stayed for just one night with work but was very happy with everything. The room was huge which was a bonus and had a table and desk, useful for working. Everything was very clean and the staff were extremely friendly and helpful. I used the pool and steam room and although quite busy I was very impressed with the facilities. The only thing I would say is that breakfast isn't served until 7am so if you need to make an early start for work it can be a bit rushed. But over all I definitely recommend and would stay again.",4,2015,07,24
248,Dissapointed,"I didn’t find a bathrobe and slippers in the room I lived in, the lamp was dirty in stains, one of the cushions was dirty in stains too. I lived in this hotel for 2 weeks and I didn’t like the service, I didn’t have soap and shower gel, shampoo, I had to go to the reception every day and ask them to bring me soap and shower gel, shampoo because after cleaning the room they forgot to put them in the bathroom. 
The gym and the pool were closed after 8 or 9 pm and I couldn’t go there because I worked and came back at 9 pm to the hotel. 
I couldn’t even try apples on the table of the reception, because they were there for just some hours in the afternoon)))) and there weren’t any in the evening.
Maybe these are small and unimportant things but I travel a lot in Russia and abroad and I was really upset, because I spent 1880 euros for 2 weeks and didn’t get the service of a 4 star hotel.",2,2015,07,24
248,Always professional & courteous,"Very good hotel in an excellent location. I stay here once or twice a month on business. The staff are always very professional, the rooms are great and the location is perfect for Dublin. 
One of the other reasons I use this hotel is that there is underground parking which is great for easy access. The hotel has started to charge €10 per night for parking so I will be taking this into consideration next time I stay in the city.",4,2015,07,21
248,"Love it, although slightly out of the way","Stayed here as part of a function for the weekend.

The hotel itself is great and very clean.

The service is excellent.

We ordered room service - wow the Caesar salad. The food is lovely. The breakfast was beautiful, self service and could eat whatever you want.

The rooms themselves however are quite small.

Good enough.",4,2015,07,20
248,3 star hotel trying to be a 4 star hotel,"Clean, safe, comfortable room.  I can see how others could complain about heat as the temperatures were about normal when we were there and we needed the windows open during the day and some nights, so if there had been a heat wave that would have been uncomfortable.  The staff was very nice, housekeeping called to be sure we didn't want service when we had kept the ""do not disturb"" sign out all day (we generally only have maid service every other day) which I thought was nice of them.  The pool is really nice.  Water was warm but the pool size was nice-big enough to swim laps, which people do, as the hotel sells memberships to Dubliners to use as a health club.  I liked that the swim area for children is walled off separately.  Fitness center was fairly well stocked with weights and machines but the obnoxious television blaring with music videos-yuck.  Hotel is convenient to a lot of the areas of interest to tourists: shopping, pubs, tour buses, etc.  We also appreciated finding some grocery stores nearby where we could pick up lunch & snacks.",3,2015,07,19
248,Great family hotel,We stayed in this hotel last November for 3 nights. The hotel is great for families and great location for shopping. The kids loved being able to go down to the pool and help themselves to breakfast. Food is very good and staff are very helpful. Also has free wifi which is great when you take kids away. Rooms are comfortable and clean. Only 1 Lewis stop from St Stephens Green or a short walk to it. ,4,2015,07,18
248,great hotel,"Stayed at Candem Court for one night everything about the hotel was very good ,Polite and helpful staff,lovely rooms,good food,will definately stay again.The location is grand as the Lucas is 2min walk ,Harcourt being the station and goes to St.Stephens Green,",4,2015,07,17
248,Ok Stay with Arbitrary Curfew--no visitors after midnight,"The hotel was in a good location with clean rooms and a nice variety of amenities.  There was mild construction going on outside our window and repainting of the hallway but this was fine as we were not in the room long enough for it to be a constant bother.  The majority of the staff that I interacted with were courteous, personable and helpful. 

Take note that the hotel does not allow visitors after midnight and does not notify guests registered at the hotel of this policy in advance. There is one sign that the hotel posts in the window of the door near the parking lot that faces outside.  The hotel posts and removes this notice every day.  A guest leaving for the day would never see the sign until returning at night. Specifically, I observed the sign being removed a few minutes before 7:00 am on the day that we checked out. 

The policy is not posted in the room, on the doors of the hotel, in the booking terms and conditions, on the website or explained during checkin.  The issue is that guests do not realize there is a curfew until they return to the hotel, rather than before they leave so they can plan accordingly.

Hotel policies concerning safety and security should not be hidden from guests during the day and posted arbitrarily on one side door at night.  

To follow up, I contacted 6 5-star hotels in Dublin to ask about their policies on visitors--only one has a visitor curfew (1:30 am) and the hotel informs guests of this rule in advance.",3,2015,07,15
248,great hotel with good facilities  easy walking to city and Iveagh Gardens,"Great stay with lovely facilities awesome breakfast and all within easy walking distance of the Iveagh Gardens and city centre. Also right next door to a pub that offers late nights and live music. I hate cities but just love Dublin such friendly people and so laid back. Plenty to do for young and old, great food is available for all budgets to.",5,2015,07,14
248,Standard,Nice hotel but nothing special. Bed wasn't that comfortable and the room was too hot. In my opinion no better than a village hotel and twice the price. Food on the hot breakfast was Luke warm and there was mould on the bread I toasted. Bit disappointed if I'm honest. ,3,2015,07,13
248,Visit to celebrate our emerald wedding anniversary in the Emerald Isle.,"We stayed three nights in Room 343 which was very clean and adequately equipped for our needs, as was the common areas of this smart hotel.  The staff throughout the establishment were smart, cheerful and extremely helpful.  This was particularly evident at breakfast which was a daily treat in itself.  We enjoyed the leisure centre very much and used the pool and sauna daily.  Although we did not use the fitness centre, it looked well equipped and well maintained.  As part of our celebration we were lucky enough to see a 20th anniversary performance of Riverdance at the Gaiety Theatre, but we unfortunately failed to take the programme on departing the hotel the following day.  On return home I emailed the hotel and requested that it be sent to us, on the off chance that it was still in the room.  Sadly we were too late and it had already been disposed of.  But that was not the end of it: the hotel  obtained another copy from the theatre and sent it to us.  I offered to reimburse the costs incurred but the hotel insisted that it was a gift for our 55th wedding anniversary.  What does that say about aftercare of guests?  This gesture was typical of the warmth and friendliness of the people we met in Dublin and we have threatened to return to the same hotel for our 60th anniversary!",5,2015,07,12
248,Dublin perfection!,"I am an avid traveler- and one who is especially infatuated with Ireland! I did my college exchange there & boyfriend lived there, so became very at home! I couldn't pass up an opportunity to spend another Paddy's day there with a group of friends & knew exactly where we needed to stay! Camden Court is the PERFECT spot to stay in Dublin if you don't want to spend an arm & a leg doing it. It it located right next to a Luas stop (the awesome trolly), and all the fun pubs, bars, city center, Stephen's Green etc! I actually used to live in an apartment right across the street! For the location & price, you just can't beat it! You do not want to book a hotel on the other side of the river (the side with the Spire).. it's far away and a little sketchier. For a hotel in Dublin I also think it was on point comfort wise, again, especially for the price. It seems like very few of the hotels in Europe (most notably Ireland) I have stayed in have been the most trendy, modern, places- but that certainly doesn't take away from the charm. You are in an older city, things might not look brand new in rooms.. it's ok :)! However, you aren't staying in a castle, it isn't that old.. just understand its not like a new US hotel :). Everything in our room was super clean and all of the staff was super friendly. Without a doubt I will be back in Dublin & again, without a doubt I will be staying at the Camden Court!",5,2015,07,11

The staff were fantastic, Attentive, friendly and helpful. The breakfast was great, full of traditionakl and continenetal choices, certainly plenty of it and very tsasty. The bar was just like a hotel bar so relatively quite, but clean and well run. There was a pub next door so being quite was NO issue.
Well worth staying there if your in Dublin.",5,2015,07,02

248,Good for business or pleasure,The hotel is very welcoming the rooms are quite modern.  It's positioned well for getting into the city or for other attractions.  The food in both the restaurant and the bar is good.  The staff were helpful and friendly. The only downside is the rooms are very warm.  Attending a training course whilst staying here the facilities were good and the training rooms were air conditioned which was a bonus although some of the delegates were subjected to putting on their coats,4,2015,06,28
248,GREAT Hotel,"The room was comfortable, very clean, and had a lot of space.  The shower had really good water pressure and was big enough to fit two people (wink, wink).  The bed was very comfortable too.  Lastly, the staff was extremely friendly and helped us make local calls to our B&B that we were travelling to in Wexford after leaving Dublin, and to our pre-arranged tour that we had set up in Killarney.  I'm surprised this hotel is not more highly rated overall.  I couldn't find anything to complain about.",5,2015,06,27
248,Request a fan in the summer,"I have stayed here twice and I was satisfied with both stays. The staff are nice, location decent and the rooms were clean, comfortable and cosy. People complaining about noise on the street are taking the mick. Its a bustling capital city center hotel, if you open your windows and expect the gentle serence sounds of a babbling brook then I dont think travelling is for you.

Now I can see that Camden court has a customer service person dedicated to reading and responding to these reviews so I hope you listen to what im about to say and take it on board: You do not need to pump insane amounts of heat into the hallways of your hotel in June. Its a pleasant 18C outside on average this time of year yet the little closets in the hallways are full of heating pipes that pump outrageous amounts of heat out to the halls and thus into the rooms. I have a little thermometer keychain that read 30C at one point. THIRTY! Now perhaps its unavoidable and perhaps those heating pipes actuall serve a purpose. If so then please explain what that purpose is. The heat in the room made sleeping a nightmare if you'll pardon the pun. At 3am on my first night i had enough and called downstairs for a fan. They were courteous and quick and brought one up for me.

Please fix the heating issue and your hotel will get 5/5 from me.",4,2015,06,27
248,great,"We were taking a 2 night break for a relatives birthday party and chose this hotel because of the location,  which was close to the party and the city centre. Lovely clean hotel, pleasant good-sized room, comfy bed, friendly reception & dining staff, easy parking ( 10 euro per night), tasty breaky, great location. Perfect!",5,2015,06,24
248,Excellent,"This hotel is amazing. Well appointed. Excellent staff, food, facilities and well positioned for city centre. I cannot recommend this hotel enough. The reception staff were so helpful when checked in it made our break in Dublin easy and relaxed by recommending transport booking us a taxi showing us where the buses could be reached and what to view and how to get there whilst staying in Dublin.",5,2015,06,23
248,Wonderful  experience,"Very enjoyable  stay here, rooms very clean and great size. Restaurant and bar are fantastic and staff are so helpful and welcoming, highly recommend staying at this hotel. Breakfast was very good with a great variety of foods.",5,2015,06,22
248,Girls treat,"On a 2 night short stay treat. Our room is lovely clean & well presented. Located on the 4th floor back of hotel. The beds are extremely comfy with crisp linen. Love the frameless flat screen TV. Excellent WiFi too. Had dinner in restaurant very good standard, enjoyable and competitively priced. Breakfast great with plenty of choice. Parking available at hotel real bonus at 10 euro per night. Availed of the leisure centre with very welcoming staff Robbie showing us around with coffee & refreshments on hand. Gym & pool are kept sparkling clean & fresh smelling. With sauna, steam room & a nice length pool at a comfortable temperature. Super facility with a city hotel. Also had beauty treatments again great offers available. All staff were attentive & helpful. Would recommend this hotel.",4,2015,06,17
248,Not as good as the others ,"This hotel is in need of updating. The rooms are pleasant but the hallways and doors to the rooms are worn. 

The staff can be rude as well. The location is not convenient to shopping or restaurants. The gym is only open until 9:00 pm. I will not stay here again. ",2,2015,06,15
248,Enjoyable experience,"I stayed here for four nights during a conference, and it turned out to be a good choice. The conference I attended managed to negotiate a good price, otherwise I would say that the room was quite expensive, but then I don't know much about hotel prices in Dublin in general. I liked the room very much, spacious with a large and comfortable bed, a chair to relax and a desk to work at. The bathroom was large enough and included a bath-tube. Breakfast included a cold buffet and a toaster, and the cook would serve you warm dishes upon request (a little strange that guests were not allowed to serve themselves, but it didn't make much difference. Plenty of seats for breakfast. The quality of food was good, and the restaurant seemed to be spacious. Unfortunately I wasn't able to check out the fitness center. 

The breakfast room turns into a restaurant in the afternoons/evening, looked nice, but didn't have dinner there. There is also a snackbar at the hotel, nice with decent small meals. 

The hotel is located in the southern part of Dublin City. It is about a ten minutes walk to the north to St. Stephens Green, and a further 5-10 minutes to Trinity College, Temple Bar 15-20 minutes. The staff were helpful and polite in answering requests, and check-in/check-out was efficient.",4,2015,06,15
248,Birthday weekend ,"Surprised my other half with a stay at Camden Court at the end of May,  and I wasn't disappointed, Good selection at the breakfast buffet with hot and cold foods. Lovely bedrooms, comfortable beds, and the staff were super friendly! Very handy to the main centre. Would definitely stay here again! ",4,2015,06,14
248,Superb!,"I spent two nights in this hotel. My very first impression when I got into the room was more than positive. I loved it. The beds are so comfy that I would have stayed in all day long! We were on the 3rd floor/road side so it wasn't that loud for us. The only thing I didn't ""enjoy"" that much is the location. Even if it's not too far from the center (20min from/to Temple Bar), I found it too quite. We had tried to find a place where to eat on Sunday and everything was closed but tesco so we had to go to the center. That's the only downside I'd say but it shouldn't stop you from staying there because there are lots of buses near and even one going straight to the airport (#16) :)",4,2015,06,14
248,Lovely accomodations,Our rooms were not ready but we were able to check our luggage at the hotel.  There are several cafes within walking distance and stop 12 for the city transit is nearby.  Our room was on the inside facing the parking lot and it was very quiet.  It is wonderful sleeping with  the window open the ocean breeze is comforting. A quick note that the key card is needed to access the lights and they are on a short timer. We left the card in the slot while we were in the room and all was great. We really liked the historic charm of this lovely hotel.  The restroom is newly renovated with high end features and the hair dryer is in the desk drawer.  A lovely find!,4,2015,06,11
248,Would not rate it 4 stars,This hotel has seen better days - all the professional pics make it look renovated and new - but that is not what we got in our hotel room - it looked completely different and plain. It was fine for a one night stay - but not worth how much we paid. It was far from a lot of the sites so we ended up taking a lot of taxis around Dublin as well.,3,2015,06,08
248,No longer a 4 star. Sadly disappointing ,"The hotel has certainly seen better days. Mainly caters to loud noisy bus tours who ""chat"" in the hallways until the wee hours and as rooms are not well insulated you get to hear.  Cigarette smell in room. This may come from the courtyard below but hotel tries to air out rooms by opening windows onto said courtyard. Bedding is old and scratchy, pillows need replacing, hotel needs painting...  You can fare far better elsewhere especially as it is priced to reflect a better hotel. ",2,2015,06,07
248,nice short stay,"We stayed here in March for just one night as we were going to Sabor Brazil for the dining experience so wanted to stay somewhere near by so we could both have a few drinks. The hotel was very clean, modern and the reception staff were lovely. We headed out for dinner and were back late enough. We had a few drinks at the hotel bar and it was great. We didnt have breakfast here as we were still full from the night before!  Cant say too much more as it was only a short stay, but would recomend it. I would say it was proably a little steep for room only price but thats Dublin I guess",4,2015,06,04
248,Good value great staff,"Stayed at CC for business. Location is excellent within walking distance of business center and in a very pleasant neighborhood. Hotel has the required amenities and a very helpful and amicable staff. Do recommend it.
Only suggestion to hotel management is to let the heat on a little longer as rooms do get cold.",4,2015,06,04
248,Awesome goldmine,"Booked this via Hotels.com and was concerned as we got it very cheaply and having read the reviews my expectations were lowered. However, on my arrival the welcome received and the awesome room we got made my day and my weekend. Totally recommend the Camden court in Dublin to everyone. It is spacious, clean and the staff are all very welcoming and helpful. Well done Camden Court for the outstanding service.",5,2015,06,04
248,Very good hotel.,"Well positioned in Dublin with a short walk of approx 15 mins to Grafton street, good parking and a very good leisure centre.
Ideal for exploring Dublin for shopping or for enjoying the city restaurants.
We didn't eat in the restaurant so I can't comment on the food
I would highly recommend it!
",4,2015,06,03
248,Friendly and convenient location,"Friendly is the word from the moment we parked at the hotel.  The conference staff were happy to direct us to the reception. Reception checked us in and inquired if we needed other assistance. 
The hotel is close to pubs, sights, and public transportation. Parking is easy and on site.",5,2015,06,03
248,Very nice hotel,This is a very nice hotel in center city Dublin.  Not new but well maintained.  Very comfortable. Very friendly staff. Nice amenities.  A 10-15 min walk from most of Dublin's sights.  Comfortable king bed.  We did not try their breakfast or restaurant.,4,2015,06,01
248,Loud & a little too gritty,"This looks like a nice hotel online and while standing in the lobby; however, it goes downhill by the time you hit the corridor - or at least on the 2nd floor. Noise from the street was ridiculous, even earplugs did not help. The beds were comfy and the furnishings seemed new - so maybe another room higher up or off Camden would be better. 

Wifi did not work in the room, but was good in the lobby. Waitstaff in the lobby were attentive and swift with a cocktail. 

The front desk staff were very kind and helpful, but I found the breakfast staff rather condescending - especially the host who kept interrupting my transaction to yuck-it-up with the business men and let them pay before me because they were working. What did he think I was doing in Dublin? So, if you don't want to be invisible, wear a tie and rush around with briefcase, coffee & scone and act too important to wait for a lady to settle her bill. You'll get good service. 

 The leisure center was simply too dirty to use. The female changing room was dank and smelly, complete with wads of stray hairs and an old bandage. And it's not just a day's grime we are talking about - take a good look at the black vermin spreading out from the baseboards. When was the last time that place was really cleaned? 

I do like the location of this hotel, and I love the Pub just outside its doors, ""The Bleeding Horse."" I liked the front desk and the afternoon waitstaff. I probably won't stay again and I won't recommend. It's just a little too gritty for the price - or for any price.",2,2015,05,30
248,Great Location,"Lovely hotel situated on a busy street, near many good Irish pubs and restaurants. Hotel room was big and spacious, clean with all the amenities that you need. Hotel staff a very helpful with requests. Lighting in room was not sufficient no ceiling lights you had to rely on bedside lights. No hair dyer in room or safe ?? when I asked was told it was not in the room ' type ' I booked for a hotel like Camden Court and the price I would have thought this was standard, however this did not impact my stay.",4,2015,05,30
248,Efficiently run hotel,"Camden Court is a pleasant hotel situated about a 20 minute walk to the city centre. There were no grounds but the entrance was situated in a courtyard off the main street. The staff were extremely helpful and pleasant at all times and brought our luggage to the bedrooms. The buffet breakfasts were good and had a wide selection of cooked or cold food, although at times it could get a bit hectic - however, the staff responded quickly when large numbers of people needed serving. Evening meals were average.
The public areas of the hotel were very pleasant and the hotel in general was scrupulously clean. I did not visit the spa area.
My only complaint is that although I was given a very nice room at the front of the hotel, it was on a very busy road. The traffic noise stopped me getting to sleep in the evening and woke me about 4am each morning, despite wearing earplugs (which I hate). I should have complained to the hotel but was too tired the first night and then thought it might get better as the week progressed as the holiday was very intensive and I thought I would be so tired that I would sleep through the noise. I should have followed my own advice which is to complain immediately something is not to your liking - the longer you leave it the more difficult it becomes!",4,2015,05,30
248,"Convenient, clean, great service, odd room layouts","Our stay at the Camden Court Hotel was part of a tour package - the tour ended with two nights and we booked an additional two on our own. We were traveling with friends who had their own room. Our room was clean and comfortable, but the layout had some oddities. This normal type of room had two twin beds that could be shoved together to form a ""queen/king"" if selected. The door into the bathroom opened to in front of the toilet, so you had to walk around the door and be careful if someone was using the toilet. Light in front of the bathroom mirror and the room mirror was woefully inadequate. The hair dryer in a room drawer had too short a cord to be able to use it and see yourself properly in the mirror. Power outlets were inconveniently placed - only UK-style outlets were provided (except for the ""shaver"" outlet in the bathroom.) I had expected at least one European-style outlet. The beds were comfortable and with the window closed it was quiet (our room faced the courtyard), though tour buses might wake you up at inconvenient times. There is no air conditioning in the rooms.

Our friends got upgraded to a larger room that had a real queen bed, but layout issues of its own, including a mirror blocked by the TV. Their room faced the street and was much noisier than ours.

The food in the restaurant was superb for both breakfast and dinner, though service could be chaotic. The Camden Court seems to have a steady stream of tour groups through, so there end up being few tables available for those not in a group and the breakfast buffet line can be long (it is also awkwardly divided).

The front desk staff was always friendly and helpful.

WiFi service worked fairly well, but there was an often-maddening login page you had to go through which sometimes forced me to switch browsers temporarily to get logged in. Once I was logged in, though, it generally worked well and was reasonably fast.

There are lots of great pubs and restaurants nearby, including The Bleeding Horse pub and Camden Kitchen (very small but superb restaurant.) The LUAS tram stops right in front, but we walked everywhere.

For the price (our additional two nights), I think the Camden Court was an excellent value. I might stay there again though the predominance of tour groups might give me pause.",5,2015,05,28
248,A nice hotel,"We stayed here for two nights while in Dublin on vacation.  The room was clean and comfortable if not a bit small. The staff was friendly and helpful with taxis and other requests.  The location was very good, close to St. Stephens Green.  We were able to walk to most attractions.",5,2015,05,27
248,Excellent hotel,Stayed here for 2 nights very good location loved the leisure facilities would diffently stay here again very friendly staff. The breakfast was very good plenty to choose from the rooms could be bigger not much room. The only thing i feel the hotel needs is a safe in the room and a ironing board ,4,2015,05,26
248,A wonderful stay,"Not sure how you could be disappointed with this hotel....we loved it and were made to feel really comfortable in this beautiful, clean hotel with great staff to match.
The food was lovely as we ate in the evening too....not cheap but better than Temple Bar places with far better surroundings. The dinning area was immaculate with a lovely atmosphere. 
Breakfast was all past advisors had said. The choice was everything you could think of, and we were even offered croissants fruit yogurt for our early morning start.
Definitely get the Airlink bus on arrival (20mins to the centre) and include the hop on hop off bus....23 euros each or 33 euros each to include the return trip to the Airport. As our return back to the airport was too early for the bus. We asked the hotel to book us a taxi which cost us 28 euros. 
If you turn right leaving through the back of the hotel and then turn left by the tram stops you can walk into the city through St Stevens Park....a fabulous walk which only takes 15 mins at a slow pace. On the other side of the park you can pick up the tour bus which is a must. The guides are Irish and don't stop talking and making you laugh. you can also book for a ride on the ""Ducks"" here....another must if you don't mind wearing a Viking hat and roaring....great fun...and different. Oh I must mention when you walk down to St Stevens Park you pass the night clubs.....but I dare you to tell me where they are as we could only make out one. So not an issue at all......all in all the Camden Court Hotel is the best place to stay and Dublin a wonderful city....even the thousands of people on the streets celebrating the gay marriage vote didn't deter us....we didn't hear them!!
 Thank you to all at the Camden Court Hotel.....you gave us a wonderful stay and that is from someone who is very fussy on food and cleanliness.x",5,2015,05,25
248,Disappointed,"Room is small for double, very warm inside the room, booking for quiet room but given a very noisy room at the morning. Smells not good walking to the room, expectation too high I will say I am. The service could be more friendly.poor wifi. It's just my opinion, sorry for annoyed,",2,2015,05,24
248,Awesome Hotel,This was our first visit to Ireland and we were not sure where to stay.  This hotel had a great location and the accommodations were wonderful.  The front desk staff was super helpful and informative.  The breakfast staff and offerings were a bit weak but would so recommend this hotel.,5,2015,05,23
248,Ireland Vacation,We recently returned from a wonderful stay at the Camden Court in Dublin.  The hotel is very nice - great location and a top-notch staff.  The rooms are small but very comfortable with a good sized bath room.  My husband enjoyed the pool and Jacuzzi.  We loved Dublin - beautiful city and friendly people. We also enjoyed a very interesting day trip to Belfast.,4,2015,05,21
248,A great hotel in a great city,"It's always great when you do not have any expectation and this falls into this category.  This was booked by my wife as a package with a flight from my local airport and hotel all included as a weekend away.  As a more senior couple, it is a while since we have just arrived at an airport and not known what to do next.  We managed to get the bus from the airport to Dublin City centre with a pay once, travel as much as you like bus pass which I recommend. 
When we got off the bus in the City Centre, we walked to the Hotel which was about 15 minutes from the centre.  As we walked down Great Georges Street , we became despondent as we could not see any hotels, only what looked like shabby accommodation.  However, when we arrived, we were very pleased.  Room could have been bigger but not a problem. The bed was very comfortable for me, and very soft. 
So cut to the chase...
- Very well situated for exploring the city.  Once we found our bearings, we could not believe how close we were to the centre.
- There is a pub attached to the hotel if you want that. We had one drink in there and it was very busy as it was a Saturday evening.  It was not for tourists and was full of young people enjoying their Saturday night out.  
- Don't be put off like we were with where it is situated.  It is actually a lovely part of the city with a nice park just around the corner.
- The hotel restaurant charges hotel prices so no shock there.
- There a loads of good places to eat locally.  As a ""fussy"" vegetarian, I did wonder if Dublin was going to be okay for food.  Maybe we were lucky but we found Dublin an excellent place for food. 
We really enjoyed Dublin city and will return probably to this hotel.",4,2015,05,21
248,Very nice stay,The hotel is very nice. The staff was pleasant. The rooms are nice with modern touches and comfortable beds. The breakfast is good as they had a larger mix of food besides the traditional Irish breakfast food. The location is nice with easy walks to Grafton or Temple Bar. The wifi was excellent. We spent two nights in the hotel and would not hesitate to return. ,4,2015,05,20
248,Great Hotel,"I stayed in the hotel for a conference in DIT. It was a great hotel. The room was lovely, modern and comfortable. The breakfast was fantastic. I had a pizza in the bar one night. It was nice. The pool was small but clean. I used the nearby dublin bike scheme bike to get around Dublin. Staff were helpful. Overall a great hotel. Reasonable price",5,2015,05,19
248,Great visit,"We are a family of four. The breakfast was great. The room was perfect, and the location (close to St. Stevens Green) was amazing! We did not use the pool or the spa, but our stay was delightful. Would definitely recommend.",5,2015,05,17
248,Nice hotel- dodgy car park,"Nice hotel, friendly welcome when checked in. Bonus was that even though we arrived before official check in, we were able go to our room.

The hotel was a little further out of the centre than we originally thought, but still walkable 10-15 minutes away.

Rooms nicely decorated however the use of mirrors to make the rooms look bigger, left was feeling a tad queasy!

Underground car park was very dark and not that easy to park up. 

We booked before April so our car parking was free, but now there is a surcharge for parking- we think it was approx €10.50 per night.",4,2015,05,15
248,Faultless,Really enjoyed the stay. The room was newly refurbished and everything was spotlessly clean and very comfortable.The only downside was the strong smell of paint. The breakfast was also very good with plenty of choice. The hotels location is perfect for acces to the city centre.,4,2015,05,12
248,Great Bargain!,"We did a lot of shopping around and found a great deal on this hotel!  Boy, were we surprised when we got there.  It was amazing, modern, and the staff was great!  Good location for getting around to all the sites.  Would stay again!",5,2015,05,09
248,Highly Recommended,"Just stayed here for the second time in 4 months. Despite several issues with a third party booking agent,  I must say we are once more impressed with the excellent customer customer service here. Will come again.....",4,2015,05,03
248,Ok place to stay in Dublin,The Camden Court Hotel is an ok place to stay in Dublin. Not my favorite though. I stayed there a couple of weeks when I attended a conference at Dublin Castle. They organizers of the  conference reserved this hotel for me but it if it had been up to me I would have stayed at a different place. No doubt! The corridors are worn out and thee floors covered with  outdated carpet! everything else it's all right!  Breakfast is pretty good! The staff is not as friendly as you would expect for a hotel like this.,3,2015,05,01
248,Decent business hotel near the centre of Dublin,"Stayed in the Camden court for a week whilst on business.  I have stayed here previously, both before and after it was renovated.  I like the renovated rooms and, although they are not terribly big, they have all the facilities needed.  

Breakfast is particularly good with a decent choice of fresh quality ingredients.  

There are numerous pubs and restaurants in the local area and it is about a 10 minute walk to St Stephen’s green and the centre.",4,2015,05,01
248,Decent hotel in a walking distance from city center,"A lively family hotel in a 20 minutes walking distance from the heart of the Dublin city center. Bus and tram in few meters distance from the hotel, and various restaurant close by. Staff was friendly.",4,2015,04,30
248,first class hotel,"Booked this trip as a double birthday treat, for myself and my daughter-in-law's.  Hotel entrance and lobby are lovely and welcoming. Staff helpful and friendly. Was up and in our room in no time. Standard rooms are what you get in any other hotel, everything you need for a comfortable stay. Asked for rooms together but they didn't oblige. My son had ordered flowers and wine for his girlfriend's room, these were delivered to wrong room. 

 Leisure facilities were lovely, pool not massive, but sufficient. Sauna, steam room and Jacuzzi included. 

Breakfast was lovely and had everything and more. Never had a meal in restaurant but  menu was reasonably priced. We found that the drinks prices were some of the best priced in Dublin.

We had a great time in Dublin and Camden Court had everything for a luxury stay in Ireland.",4,2015,04,30
248,We so enjoyed our stay at the Camden Court Hotel,"Comments: Nice walking distance to tourist sights, very clean rooms, nice large bed, big screen T.V. comfortable bathroom; great buffet breakfast, had a delicious dinner in the dining room, friendly staff. Very comfortable large lobby with plenty of seating arrangements. Pool was not open due to repairs.",5,2015,04,29
248,Great food at the Camden,Still enjoying the great service at this hotel after 3 years. I don't often eat here just because I like getting out and about. Just had room service and had a fantastic meal. Mackerel salad starter followed by perfectly cooked lamb. I wasn't feeling like any of the desserts on the menu so they checked with the chef and did a great cheesecake to finish one of the best meals I've had in a while.,5,2015,04,28
248,Really Convenient,"A really convenient location, walked to Grafton Street, walked to The Bord Gais Energy Theatre and back no problem. Staff were very pleasant and helpful. Bedrooms were tastefully furnished and spotlessly clean. The restaurant menu was adequate , not a huge selection but what we got was very nice. Breakfast excellent.",5,2015,04,28
248,Decent Dublin City Hotel,"I stay in this hotel once a month on business, usually for one night in a double room. The rooms are a good size, well equipped but if you are a light sleeper ask for one away from the front of the hotel. Reception is professional and the restaurant serves really good food at hotel prices. Breakfast (be aware served from 07:00) is plentiful and varied. Leisure facilities are good, smallish gym and good swimming pool. Staff are all professional and efficient. All in all a very good City Centre hotel.",4,2015,04,28
248,Unique,"I recently stayed at The Camden Court Hotel while on my trip to Ireland.  Located in the busy city of Dublin in an area full of bars, restaurants and shops. Hotel is well kept.  Rooms are spacious with comfortable beds. Very clean rooms and hotel.  If this review was helpful in any way- click the ""yes"" box below,",4,2015,04,27
248,Perfect for our Dublin weekend away,Just stopped at the Camden court hotel and was perfect for seeing the sites of Dublin. Nice room with a comfy bed and nice restaurant for breakfast and dinner. In fact the meal we had Saturday night was delicious and worth every penny. Would definitely come back should we ever come back to Dublin. ,5,2015,04,27
248,Great Hotel,"We stayed at the Camden Court as a result of the recommendation of a colleague. 

From check in to check out we had a great stay. 

Our room was well appointed and very comfortable.  We had drinks and a meal in the bar which was quite good. 

The hotel is well situated and is in easy walking distance to the Grafton Street area. 

I would recommend this hotel to anyone visiting Dublin. ",5,2015,04,24
248,Perfect family occasion,"Booked a number of rooms for my family to stay overnight as I was celebrating a special occasion nearby and I have to say the service, accommodation and staff, particularly Chris at reception were excellent. They attended to all of my needs and made it a special night for me and my family. Rooms were spacious and lovely, wifi perfect and breakfast lovely. Thanks to everyone at the Camden Court hotel for your attention to detail.",5,2015,04,22
248,Ignite your Dublin trip with a visit here!,"Don't miss out on this great hotel, we stayed here for 3 nights, as part of a poetry recital group, touring Dublin for Easter.

Despite much of the city being closed for Easter, we were able to enjoy great food and drink at the hotel, the bar staying open throughout, for the obligatory Kristal poppin'.

The hotel lobby is lavishly decorated and provides a great after party, if you've just come back from a relaxed meal out.

Leisure facilities were fantastic, a great pool and really warm sauna facilities, no expense spared.

The hotel staff were very useful and even booked us some taxis on one occasion.

Please, don't miss out on this historically warm welcome!",5,2015,04,21
248,Will be back,"Lovely room, great bed despite earlier reviews, stayed two nights and slept soundly, staff friendly, ate in bar, compulsively, reasonable, but the service was exceptional, will definitely stay here when I return to dublin, had a lovely stay.p",5,2015,04,18
248,Jewel in the Crown,"Stayed for two nights on a bed and breakfast basis and arrived slightly early and was glad to find our room was ready.
We parked in the underground carpark which is free and made our way to reception.It was quick and helpfull with friendly staff.
We stayed on the 5th floor 527.It was very clean with a great smart TV.
The Meals were top class,we ate in the restaurant and had a bar meal.Both faultless.The hotel is 5 minutes walk from St Stevens Green/Grafton street area.
I would recommend this Hotel and will be back,Only one small problem was during the night there was some noise from people talking in the corridor for and banging doors etc at 2.45 am.Not the hotels fault and it was sorted out by the staff promptly.Overall a great hotel",5,2015,04,18
248,Love this hotel,"I booked the hotel sight unseen and was so excited when we arrived.  The lobby was welcoming with big comply chairs and couches and it was buzzing with people coming and going.  We arrived after an overnight flight - hoping to check into our room early - which they can't guarantee but they try really hard to make it work for you.  The desk clerk, Chris, was fab and got us into our room at 9:30 am!    We realized the room wouldn't work for us - Chris switched rooms for us - no fuss.
The restaurants were great, the location is great! I would go back.",5,2015,04,15
248,Beautifully kept and just outside of the busiest areas.,"We've stayed in this hotel before in August time and it was a perfect stay. This time we stayed early April and i was just as happy as last time. The hotel is immaculate and is located just outside of the busiest tourist areas. The only complaint we had is that our room appeared to be right next to a utility room, and when the maids were cleaning in the morning they would repeatedly slam this door which was very loud right by our heads. 
We also a few doors down from an ice machine which with it being warm whether was clearly popular and made an awful racket. 

These things do not take away from how wonderful the service of the hotel was or how nice it is, it's just pot luck which room we got, and given the amount we paid i'd have liked a bit more peace and quiet.",4,2015,04,14
248,Very good hotel ,"Good, centrally located hotel. Have stayed here a couple of times whilst visiting Dublin and find it very comfortable. Rooms are pleasant, if a little warm in the summer time. There's car parking and it's just a short walk to the city centre. Have never eaten in the hotel so I'm not sure what the food is like. There's a nice, safe feel to Camden Court Hotel and it's definitely one of my first choices for reasonably priced, central hotel accommodation in Dublin.",4,2015,04,13
248,Good Location for City Centre,Stayed with a friend in a twin room and had a swim before breakfast each morning. A great breakfast to set you up for the day. A very clean and comfortable hotel. If I ever travel to Dublin again I would want to stay here.,5,2015,04,11
248,Amazing Stay,"Myself and my partner spent the night here after spending 2 days in Dublin as we thought this was central enough for us to do all the touristy things.
I was very impressed with the hotel and its staff. We arrived at 10:30am to check they had our reservation after we had just landed and the receptionist allowed us to check in there and then which was brilliant. We were able to have a freshen up before we went out.
Our room was big and stylish, the leisure facilities were a bonus and the hotels location is great. We walked to Temple bar which took us about 20 minutes.
Again reception was brilliant and arranged a 1pm check out for us. I can’t praise this hotel and its staff enough we simply had a wonderful stay and would recommend.",5,2015,04,10
248,"Clean, comfortable 5 minute walk from Grafton street but parking and pool lets it down","Booked this hotel as it had a pool for the kids and its great location.
Location is great only 5 minute walk to st stephens green and grafton street shopping.
Also the breakfast is very good, tasty and wide selection.
The downside to the hotel is the parking.....car park is a nightmare.  Very small only 12 spaces and once its full you are directed to the underground parking for the hotel and again far too small and tight to turn a decent sized car.

Also the pool was only for people over 16 years old after 7pm which is very unsatisfactory.  The main time kids use the pool on holiday is after 7pm when they've returned from a full day sight seeing.  Keeping this in mind there are much better hotels in the area for the same price.

Otherwise rooms were clean & comfortable but would not stay again due to the parking.",3,2015,04,09
248,Easter Break 2015,"A really nice hotel, not too far from the city centre. we always took the tram which was about 6 euros return for both, else it was 10-15 min walk. the hotel has a lovely jacuzzi and sauna and steam room plus a swimming pool. this is the main reason we chose this hotel so that we could relax after a long day on our feet. we had breakfast included and was cheaper to book before hand when booking the hotel directly. only 10 euros else 13 on the day. loads of choices. the room itself was lovely and we had a back room facing car park. this didn't bother us as we were out all day. bed was comfy and so was the duvet. large flat screen tv. we arrived 11 am and so tired and luckily our room was ready for us. we never had a evening meal there but did have coffee in the lounge and eaton mess:).  on Good Friday we went out but could only do the hop-on hop-off bus as all the attractions were shut. only shops and cinemas were open. none off the pubs serve alcohol either on this day. But the bus tour was excellent, everyone should do this as i learnt so much history about the place. and the drivers made it very enjoyable.",4,2015,04,07
248,An unexpected pleasure,"We decided to extend our visit to Dublin by a day and booked a room the day before. It was very good value due to the Euro being weak. The staff made a really good first impression and were both friendly and attentive. They even suggested a restaurant for brunch, and booked a table for us.  

The room had been recently renovated so had a slight smell of paint still and the cleaner came in at 0830 while we were still sleeping! 

We also stopped for the breakfast at 13 Euros a head and was good value with a wide spread.

I would strongly recommend this hotel for anyone visiting Dublin. It is certainly a lot more accommodating than the Hilton around the corner.",5,2015,04,07
248,Gorgeous,"I stayed here last year with my uncle who was visiting from Hong Kong. Absolutely gorgeous leisure centre. Now the man working in the Leisure centre was having a cranky day, but that's okay. 

The rooms were gorgeous and clean and the bath was gorgeous in the room. Couldn't fault it besides one member of staff. Go on the lads. Fair play.",5,2015,04,06
248,Nice clean rooms ,"Stayed here for 2 nights, had 2 different rooms (my choice) which were both lovely and clean. There were plenty of amenities in the however it would have been good if they had provided dressing gowns for the spa. The staff were very nice especially the waitresses in the bar/restaurant. The hotel is in a good location close to the bars and restaurants of Camden Street which also has many busses to the Temple Bar and main areas of the city. Would stay here again. ",4,2015,04,05
248,Family Overnight Stay,"Arrived yesterday for a one night stay. Went straight to pool with 8 and 5 year old. Shallow pool great for kids. Only criticism was that my wife thought ladies changing rooms a bit tired.  Room clean and exactly as advertised. Staff really friendly and helpful. Breakfast this morning was top class with a large selection of food available.  

Summary - great stay for a good price. ",4,2015,04,04
248,Fab!,"Stayed here for two nights and was really impressed. Two double beds and one single were ready for us and our two daughters. Fab standards and very clean. Great location, not ostentatious but modern and friendly. Recommended!",5,2015,03,30
248,Beautiful Hotel,"Stayed at this hotel for a weekend away.  Good hotel, good amenities and within walking distance of all Dublin has to offer.  Staff pleasant and very helpful.  Will definitely be staying again.  Have already recommended to friends.",5,2015,03,30
248,excellent weekend away,"The hotel was better than expected for a city hotel. The pool was clean and quiet. The rooms were spacious and very quiet. The food, both at dinner and breakfast was fresh and tasty. The staff were numerous and helpful. If I visit Dublin again I would definitely stay here again.",5,2015,03,25
248,"Good value, great service","Camden court is in a good Dublin location, walking distance from Stephen's green, Grafton Street, Trinity College and other attractions. The hotel is standard business without any special character, But the rooms are classic and comfortable, the breakfast is copious, the common area spacious and staff welcoming.",4,2015,03,25
248,Beautiful hotel; horrible staff,"I recently stayed at this hotel for a weekend away with the girls. Having browsed through the pictures on their website, I was looking forward to a luxurious weekend away, being pampered in gorgeous surroundings. Instead, what I got was a feeling of interiority. So much for Irish hospitality! The staff were the rudest I've ever encountered. Misdemeanors included the manager clearing plates off our table in a bid to get us out of the bar, despite the fact that not everyone was finished eating, and they didn't close for another half hour. 
The following morning when we went down for breakfast, as we walked into the restaurant, the host barked ""€13!"". When we said, ""Sorry...?', he repeated, slowly bur firmly, ""Thir-teen euro."" My friend said, ""Em, I just wanted to get tea and toast..."" and he replied (preceded by a sigh), ""If you approach the hot buffet, it's thirteen euro!"".
As none of this were prepared for this level of condescension (we'd have paid the money had we been treated like human beings), we turned on our heels and walked to a local Spar to stock up on baguettes, cheese, etc., as none of us wanted to spend another penny in the establishment. Other than some massages, etc., that'd we'd already booked, none of us did.
The only thing that would take me back here is to watch the staff go through World Host training to see what it means to be in the service industry!",2,2015,03,25
248,Nice Hotel with Good Location,"Stayed on a Business trip for two nights at the Hotel.

Nice clean and modern rooms, my room had a view to a parking lot thought.

Very centrally located, my office was walking distance, the Trinity college was close by , Temple Bar area  and the River Liffey  are a € 10 euro taxi ride

The receptionist  was polite and helpful.

The breakfast spread is good but the same menu for the two days I was there.

WIFI had a good speed.",3,2015,03,24
248,VERY GOOD HOTEL,I have stayed in the Camden Court over a number of times in the past and the hotel is clean and the staff friendly and the lusas tram is just around the corner and only one stop away from st Stephens green or a ten minute walk.The food is also good and not badly priced . rooms can be a little warm with no aircon,4,2015,03,24
248,Central location with quality service,"Lovely place to stay with quality beds, super high quality breakfasts and genuine friendly staff. Gym facility and pool modern, up to date and well supervised.Restaurant staff were helpful and pleased to help. My grand-daughter (5yrs) was treated like a 'big girl' and loved the experience.",4,2015,03,17
248,"Very Good Hotel, Good Location, With Free parking","I love the Camden Court hotel.
You can get really great prices, book direct to save even more.
anyway, to the review.

its a large hotel with plenty of bedrooms, a bar and a large open lounge area where you can just chill or meet people.
Carparking is either at ground level via the main entrance archway, or next along is a gated underground carpark.. free if you are a guest, just get the ticket validated at the 24hr reception when you want to get out

The place has a great Swimming pool/ Fitness centre, you just need a euro coin for the lockers, towels are provided.. (you no longer need a swimming hat to go swimming)

Bedroom are modern, I had an issue in that I was first night located next to the elevator and I could hear all the noise of guest and the list motors and such, I just asked to be moved the next day and it wasn't a problem.
One Issue I notice they do have and each room has a notice about, is the doors are thick and you have to make sure it has closed itself properly, and it doesn't just do it on its own, several times I forgot and found my door as good as open.. ..

my bedroom was very modern with a good shower over the bath, cant say I am a fan of having a glass ""shower shield rather than a curtain, but it works.. just if your sat down in the bath, its a bit strange.. you don't have local control over the temperature, but reception can adjust it if you wish, the windows do open if you need a bit of fresh air.

The hotel is well situated for a quick walk onto Grafton Street and St Stephens Green(5-10 mins mostly flat) the tram also passes at the back of the hotel, and regular buses to everywhere.

As well as easy access to local restaurants,  you have two eating options in the hotel, you can get some great bar meals, in the bar or reception lounge area (homemeade burgers and pizza and fish and chips etc)

if you want something more upmarket they have a full ""proper"" restaurant which does steak and the usual affair.
I just wish they would stock half bottles of wine, as if you are a single guest, getting a full bottle is your only option or pay for an over prices glass.. .. or even if they did carafes and half carafes of house wine, that would be great.

The hotel has free wifi, you get the username and password with your check-in card, unlimited number of devices.
I found when I was there in March 2015 that it was almost useless and so slow that it was real frustrating todo anything it would just about allow collection of email, but even loading facebook took ages.. so that is a real let down...

if they could fix the wifi, I wouldn't ever consider even looking at a different hotel, but next trip , I will look around and see if I have other options",4,2015,03,17
248,Great value for money,"Stayed at this hotel from 13-15 march as a group of 10 ladies who were in Dublin for a hen party. 
As we had an early flight we arrived at the hotel around 10am but was unsure whether we would be able to check in as it stated check in was was from 2pm on my paperwork. The gentleman who was behind reception was pleasant and extremely helpful and stated that if he had enough rooms for us he would check us in. Fortunately he did so this was a bonus. 
We had twin bedded rooms which were nicely decorated, smart tv, hairdryer, iron and ironing board, lovely bathroom and most importantly clean. 
During our stay we had breakfast at the hotel which was €10 per day which was excellent value as there was everything you could wish for. Unfortunately we didn't get chance to use the pool so I'm unable to comment.
All in all we had a fab weekend in a fab hotel in a fab city. Camden court hotel you didn't disappoint. ",5,2015,03,16
248,"Great stay, would come again.","This hotel is very clean, staff are very polite, helpful and very informative about the local area. The room was very modern and bathroom clean. The facilities are great here too with a great restaurant, bar which plays sports (but not loudly to interrupt a quiet drink) and the leisure centre which has a pool and gym. Would look to stay here on my next visit of Dublin.",5,2015,03,16
248,Clean and well looked after.,I recently stayed here whilst working away. The main thing that I though was good about this place were the cleanliness of the rooms the maids were fantastic. Sizeable room with comfy bed. Restaurant food were really nice and staff very friendly! Great place to stay 8/10,4,2015,03,10
248,An average yet pleasant stay,"I booked this hotel for one night, for a friends surprise birthday. We had two full days in Dublin and although we only had the one night’s stay – the hotel were very accommodating and looked after our luggage before and after check out to let us explore the city.

I stopped at Camden Court Hotel some twenty years ago – I can’t promise that the rooms have had a full upgrade since then, but what I will say is that it is a clean hotel and the communal areas have certainly been updated. The lobby, bar and restaurant areas are welcoming, staff are exceptionally friendly - the lovely lady on reception was a great help to us during our stay, offering advice on where to go and directions/buses to take.

We had a large family room with two doubles and one single bed – plenty of room for the three of us. The bathroom could have done with an upgrade, as could the chairs, carpets etc., but certainly not enough to put me off stopping there again. It’s more of a 3* than a 4* hotel as is advertised. There is room service available however it’s in a good location – about a 10 minute walk away from Grafton Street / Temple bar area and Camden Street is a popular area for pubs and bars – plenty of choice for food outside of the hotel.

To say we slept with the windows open, we enjoyed a peaceful night’s stay, however it was a Sunday, not sure if it would be louder on a Friday or Saturday night – can’t imagine so though.

We got the AirCoach to the hotel, it’s a lot cheaper than a taxi and apart from not dropping you off right outside the hotel – it’s really convenient. It’s about a 10 minute walk providing you go in the right direction! Ask the driver if you are unsure.

All in all, an enjoyable stay... although, if like me, you prefer the finer things in life - you may decide to pay a little extra for one of the 4-5* hotels.",3,2015,03,10
248,Great hotel & fab location,"Me and my sister stayed here on the 3rd march for one night. The rooms are clean and well equipped... I loved the shower..it was actually better than mine at home. We also had full use of the pool, sauna and steam room...extremely happy...after a day shopping it was great to relax here...the breakfast which was included was amazing!!!!! Loads to chose from!! And the chef was very friendly too.. All and all...we would defiantly stay again...",5,2015,03,07
248,Clean But Noisy,"The room was clean, but the street noise could easily be heard in the room with the window closed. The room was small and crowded. I was glad we were only there for one night. The staff was helpful. I agree with other reviews that the Irish Charm was missing as compared to the two other hotels we stayed at in Ireland. Plus we didn't have enough sockets to charge our phones, etc at the same time.",3,2015,03,06
248,Wonderful Location,"We stayed at the hotel for 5 nights.  Our room was clean and had a nice decor.  It had all of the amenities you would expect  What it did not have to unpack  was a set of dresser drawers to unpack our clothes our clothes. It did have a closet to hang items. There were shelves, but that housed the complimentary tea and coffee items.  We lived out of our suitcases for 5 days.  Our room was on the second floor and we did hear a lot of the street noise. We were unable to keep the window open at night. The location of the hotel was within reasonable walking distance of most of the sights and events we wanted to see.  The breakfast buffet had everything you could possibly want to eat!  We ate dinner one night at the restaurant and were quite pleased.  The staff throughout the hotel were from areas all around the world.  All were very professional and pleasant, but overall missing that ""famous Irish charm.""  The hotel does have a park, which is a major plus, but it is limited.  Our last night there we created our own spot and hoped the car would still be there in the morning.  Overall, the Camden Court Hotel is a lovely place to stay.",4,2015,03,05
248,Christmas Party,"I stayed here the night of my work Christmas party which was being held in the hotel. Myself and two of the girls I work with decided to book a triple room so we could enjoy the party for longer. The hotel is in a great location, easily accessible by public transport and has an underground car park so we could drive there straight from work. The staff were friendly and helpful throughout, it didn't take long to check in or out. The room was quite expensive for just one night, even with a party discount, so I'm not sure how much it would cost for a double - it was around the Christmas period though so that must be taken into consideration. The room itself was lovely, very spacious with a double bed, a double pull out couch bed and a single pull out couch bed. Plenty of room for the three of us. The room was clean on arrival and had plenty of amenities (large closet, hairdryer and lovely bathroom as well as a big screen TV). Surprisingly, despite the city centre location there was no noise that night and I slept easily without being woken once. I was happy with my stay, it was nothing extravagant but I'd definitely stay again if the party was to be held there another year.",3,2015,03,03
248,Very Good Hotel,"We stayed here for 3 nights for the rugby international. Location was great being walkable to Temple Bar and Aviva Stadium. The room was comfortable & clean &  breakfast was a good buffet. The swimming pool was also very good

All the staff were very friendly & hospitable. Highly recommended",5,2015,03,03
248,A very good City Centre Hotel,We recently went to Dublin for the first time to watch the Six Nations Match between Ireland and England (shame about the result!) and booked for the weekend at the Camden Court. Good location for walking to the City Centre and close to the Hop on Hop off bus. The accommodation and the breakfast service and food quality were very good and there was good ambience in and around the reception lounge and bar. The best bits were the friendliness and efficiency of all the staff and the quality of the pool/gym area for a city centre hotel. Overall better than most city centre hotels we have stayed in anywhere.,5,2015,03,03
248,Great Location and Easy access to city,"Spent 2 nights there for the 6 Nations rugby game. It's location was great giving easy access to the local pubs and bars plus only 10 mins walk to Temple Bar area (very expensive there, best to drink in local bars to the Hotel). For sports fans it is a easy 30 mins walk to the Aviva, but plenty of stop off's if needed. The staff were great and the bar in the Hotel was cheaper than some of the pubs (but not the atmosphere). The full Irish breakfast is a must and sets you up for the whole day. We did have a bar meal there in the evening and that was very good and not too expensive. Didn't have time to use any of the facilities on offer but they looked very good. The rooms were very good, only down fall was a very small basin and nowhere to put your own toiletries out as the was only a small shelf. Overall it is very good and I would use it again (if the price was right).",5,2015,03,03
248,Lovely Hotel,"My husband and I stayed for 3 nights midweek.  Our room was lovely, very large with a double bed and 2 double sofas (which were fold out beds).  The decor and furnishings were very modern and appeared very new.  Our room looked onto a busy road but the double glazed windows kept all noise out.  The swimming pool was great and staff very helpful.  The full Irish breakfast is a must and there was no need for lunch after the fantastic breakfast which kept us going all day.  We did not have an evening meal in the hotel but this was simply due to the fact we were exploring the city for this first time and had too many options for evening meals.  The hotel menu did appear to be very good though.  A special mention to the hotel staff who were very pleasant and more than helpful.  A ten minute walk takes you straight into the city centre.  We would definately return to this hotel - well done!",5,2015,02,28
248,Concert,"Stayed here numerous times. Very easy to access when driving, no need to drive through city (when coming from Waterford) Beautiful hotel, quiet expensive, but would pay the money again to stay here as i did enjoy it",5,2015,02,27
248,Centrally located but a little dated!,"Spent 2 nights here in Feb to celebrate my 30th with my partner. Great location with buses, trams and bars within walking distance. Town centre is also a nice 15 minute walk. Only downsides are the rooms are quite dated and in desperate need of modernising and the pool area looks a lot nicer in the pictures.",3,2015,02,24
248,first rate hotel dublin,"Stayed at this hotel for 3 nights. Very friendly staff superb pool/sauna/jacuzzi area & for
a hotel in the city centre reasonably priced. Would definitely recommend & if returning to Dublin
in future would certainly book again.",5,2015,02,24
248,Worth a visit,Hubby and I are just back from a two day mid-week break.  The hotel is conveniently situated to t the city centre but far enough to enjoy tranquillity in the evening.  The Camden area is not a location I am familiar with but it was very pleasant.  We enjoyed the bar meals in the evening and the breakfasts are well worth including.  Pool area was lovely - we visited twice and the afternoons were very quiet and relaxing which is just what was needed after a hard days shopping.  Foyer was a pleasant area to sit and people watch and helped with the atmosphere in the hotel which was welcoming.  Parking on site at the hotel is a real bonus and they validate your ticket which meant that the parking was free.,4,2015,02,22
248,Excellent choice for a full-service hotel; great location,"We spent four nights in February at the Camden Court, and were very pleased with every aspect of this hotel. The Irish buffet breakfast is wonderful and ample. (The Irish bacon is to die for!) The location is very convenient-about three blocks to the Hop-On-Hop-Off stop at st Stephen's Green;  right next door to the Bleeding Horse pub, and within an easy walk of several other restaurants and pubs. The front desk staff performs concierge services admirably. They cheerfully provided information on public transportation, made recommendations for restaurants, made reservations for us, and arranged taxis for us. They could not have been more helpful or polite. I did not use the Health Club downstairs, but my husband checked it out and was quite impressed with the offerings there, for those who want to work out. You can pay a lot more for one of the Big Name hotels in Dublin, but why would you? The Camden Court is an excellent choice!",5,2015,02,21
248,"Good service, nice breakfast","I stayed at Camden Court for 7 nights and enjoyed every one of them. The staff is very friendly, and the breakfast very nice. Well-functioning fitness center. Okay eat-out places and LUAS station nearby. We use the hotel every year and look forward to it.",4,2015,02,20
248,Excellent place to stay,This hotel is an excellent place to stay if you are going to Dublin.The staff are very friendly and helpful.The rooms are very comfortable and clean.The restaurant is large and a good selection of food for breakfast.Anyone who would not be pleased with this hotel would be very hard to please.,5,2015,02,20
248,Fantastic! 10/10,"Our first family holiday together and we'd chosen the Camden Court after our daughter spotted the swimming pool. Id read some mixed reviews but I honestly could not find a single negative with the hotel or location. It is a little bit of a walk into the city but that's half the fun isn't it?  If not - get a cab! 

Our room was brilliant, clean and comfortable and the food, staff and service were first class. My wife, daughter and I absolutely loved it and we  also bumped into John Hartson there too. The staff were always ready to help and we cant wait to get back there. Brilliant - highly recommend. 

",5,2015,02,19
248,great hotel,loved this hotel. good location only a walk away from the main bars of dublin. receptionist asked on arrival if we wanted to pay in euros or our normal stirling which was good!  room was a nice size and bed very comfy - nightclub to the left and a bar to the right if your into clubbing or nice drink!,5,2015,02,16
248,VERY GOOD CHOICE...BUT BEWARE,"CAMDEN COURT

A really pleasant centrally-located city centre hotel a short walk from St Stephen Green. The rooms (based on mine) are a little on the small side, with minimal wardrobe/storage, but are modern, clean and comfortable. (I later found out my room was indeed small compared to others on the same floor - maybe the A at the end of the room number should have given it away!). The hotel has extremely good facilities and charming, friendly staff. Whenever I asked for information or advice they went above and beyond the call. There is a very nice bar, a good restaurant and full access to a more than adequate gym, pool and sauna/steam room. I asked to change my room on checking-in (purely a personal dislike of being the room next to the lift) and my request couldn't have been handled more efficiently. The room I was moved to was at the back of the hotel (which is on quite a busy road/intersection) was blissfully quiet. If breakfast isn't included in your room rate then the Camden Court offers an excellent one at an all-inclusive rate of €13 - a lesson there for some other hotels and their rip-off breakfast menus! NOTE: Beware of room 451A. If you're getting it at a reduced rate compared to the other standard rooms, then fine. If not and it isn't explained to you that it's small in comparison then you are being short changed.",4,2015,02,12
248,Lovely Hotel,We stayed here whilst on a girls weekend in Dublin. The hotel is clean modern and the staff were very friendly. It also has a spa and gym which was an added bonus. The rooms are well equipped and comfortable. We flew into Dublin airport and got a bus to the city centre. The hotel is a good fifteen minute walk from the closest bus stop and it takes you through the main shopping area. There are bars and restaurants close by but Temple Bar is again about twenty minutes away. There was a bit of noise at night due to the bars and nightclubs but other than that it was a good find.,4,2015,02,12
248,"Decent hotel, a bit of a walk to main attractions.","We've stayed at this hotel before and it was just so-so. This year they've given the rooms a fresh coat of paint. It's definitely a bit nicer now!

Our room was amply sized. The bed was hard, which made for an achy back. There were four non-feather pillows, which was nice. There was a power outlet on each side of the bed for charging phones and laptops, but they were only accessible by unplugging the nightstand lamps; while that works, a simple power hub on each nightstand would be an excellent solution here.

The bathroom had a shower/tub combo. There was next to no visible mold in the shower tile grout--great job, housekeeping! Water pressure was great, and the hot water stayed hot.

The free WiFi worked perfectly. The room had a safe. Hotel has limited parking.",3,2015,02,09
248,Decent hotel in a central location,"Stayed here in November whilst at a match.  Good hotel, clean, staff friendly.  Pretty good value. Walking distance to a good range of pubs and restaurants. parking on site which is handy.  Bar is a bit devoid of atmosphere (but so are most hotel bars).",4,2015,02,09
248,Ok hotel - staff are good,Stayed at this hotel for business and held some training sessions in the conference area.  The hotel is ok.  Basic and functional.  My room was fine apart from the shower which had little power and all night there was a high pitched humming coming from the heating.  The people who run the meeting/conference area were great and nothing was too much trouble.  The meeting room was a bit tired but fine and served the purpose.,3,2015,02,08
248,OK hotel in Dublin,"I have now stayed here a few times for business as our office is 3mins walk away from the hotel. It is located OK for walk to several restaurants/pubs in the city, but a bit too far walk to the temple bar area. If you want to run St Stephen's park is close by or you could run along the canal close by the hotel. The hotel also has an indoor pool, but very small, so can get crowded very easily. Also sauna and steam room.
They also have opportunity for meal in the bar or the restaurant. Both are reasonable. Breakfast is good and enough choice. Overall an OK hotel to stay in the city at a reasonable price.
Try to stay away from rooms close to elevator and they need to do some work on the heating system in the rooms and/or have opportunity to open window.",3,2015,02,07
248,Lovely clean warm and welcoming,Lovely hotel with some nice special touches here and there. Nice sitting areas and dining areas very nice. Room lovely and very spacious and warm. Only slight thing was a bit noisy throughout the night as overlooked the street. ,4,2015,02,06
248,Enjoyable St Patrick's Day Stay,Stayed at the Camden Court Hotel as part of our trip.  The rooms were comfortable and the breakfast was great.  The attached restaurants provided a quieter alternative to the livelier pubs closer to town for the St Patrick's Day weekend.  The staff was helpful.  I would definitely consider staying here if I am ever able to return to Ireland for another trip.,5,2015,02,05
248,Very good,"It's a very good hotel : nice and friendly staff, very large rooms, swimming pool, hammam, sauna, etc. : the only bad thing worth mentionning is that the breakfast DOESN'T HAVE ANYTHING WITH CHOCOLATE !!! It's weird and the overall breakfast experience is not as good as everything else.",4,2015,02,04
248,"Nice and quiet, wonderful atmosphere and brilliant breakfast","Camden Court Hotel is fairly central - 12 minutes' walk from Crafton Street and St. Stephen's Green.
Quiet meetings are held in the lobby where there is good service.
The rooms are clean and spacious, wifi well functioning, no noice from the street... all is good!
Breakfast is brilliant! Bar is good. Food is good - what's not to like?
Go there - it is not expensive.
OOOhhh, by the way, you can use both swimming pool and gym for free!!
Highly recommendable!",5,2015,02,03
248,Great weekend ,I booked this hotel as a surprise birthday trip for my boyfriend. We couldn't of asked for anything more. The location is great just outside the main hustle but close enough to walk and with many good pubs close by. (Try the bleeding horse for food). The hotels breakfast was brilliant and the staff were very friendly. We arrived early in the morning and having had a really early start were so pleased we could check in early at 9am to settle in before heading out sight seeing. If we visit Dublin again we'd definitely stay here again. ,5,2015,02,02
248,Superb,"I have stayed in this hotel many times and keep returning as it meets all our needs. The location is perfect as you can walk to Grafton street in approx 5 mins, the Luas can be accessed just outside the hotel for travels further afield. The bedrooms are of a Reasonable size for a city and very comfortable and the staff are so friendly and helpful. The hotel serves wonderful food both in the restaurant and the bar and the breakfast is truly wonderful and if you are staying at the weekend you can have breakfast up to 11am so you can even enjoy a well deserved 'lie in'. The car parking, gym and swimming pool are additional bonuses. I find it difficult to go past this hotel when booking my little weekends away.",5,2015,01,30
248,Dublin visit,"Our group were back in the Camden Court Hotel for our weekend visit for the national stadium boxing champions.
Hotel as before was welcomning and had all the facilities to make our stay very enjoyable.
Eary morning breakfast was great value at €10 and the bar servise was first class.

One area for attention was the absence of a shaving point in the bathroom.

We will be back. !!
Regards, Sean Horkan.",4,2015,01,28
248,Mixed views...,"We booked this hotel for one night in Dublin.
Upon first impressions, the area that the hotel is in is pretty dingy and away from the centre of town.
The bonus to this is that there is free parking.
We were swiftly checked in and the man on reception was very polite and helpful.
I was disappointed with the decor of the hallways and the room. Despite the hotel stating that the rooms have recently been refurbished, I didn't think that they were anywhere near four star standard. The bathroom was dated and there was no safe. How can a hotel be given a four star rating when it doesn't have a safe?! 
The pillows were uncomfortable and the wifi signal kept dropping out.
We took a taxi to the Jameson Distillery as we would have had to get a bus and a tram, which cost €10 there and back. 
The following day, we had breakfast which was very nice and there was a large selection. 
We drove to Kilmainham Gaol which was about a 15 minute drive away.
Overall, our stay was satisfactory but I would definitely not call this hotel a four star and personally found it overpriced at €129 a night. ",3,2015,01,28
248,Lovely stay,"Lovely room, free wifi, breakfast was brilliant, the staff were great, very helpful and friendly, one even helped us print out our boarding passes. Although one team member Kris. He was very rude, he even tutted and signed when we approached the desk to check in! Not a great first impression. 

We enjoyed ourselves for the 4 nights we were there, location is easy to get to from airport, we hopped on 1 bus and it took us to the entrance of our hotel. 

The pool and facilities were very nice, clean and relaxing. 
The zoo is a must see.",5,2015,01,26
248,Super Stay,"stayed in friday night with my boyfriend and we had a great stay with no complaints. The staff were super , really helpful with all our queries on parking (which is free till one on day of checkout) and anything else we asked, they were very friendly checking us in early and when we went to use the pool . The room was very clean and nicely set up with some toiletries in the bathroom but i do think it could do with a slight update overall but overall a great room and we were able to sleep really well.  We both used the pool on the friday evening before dinner and the facilities were really good and we went for a swim and relaxed in the pool are for awhile before heading out.For those that dont have anything with them there are swim suits etc for sale. We also saw the gym which was good too with plenty of machines/weights etc for anyone that might want to use it. Breakfast was super , there were tons of options available from cereals, breads, cold meats, hot food and the staff were over straight away to offer fresh tea/coffee when we sat down. I would highly recommend staying here for a night or two as its got a great location , ten mins from the stephens green walking and on a luas line and the parking is a super addition .",4,2015,01,25
248,Great hotel -Very Central,Stay here regularly for work. Rooms are clean and beds comfortable. All rooms seem to have a large flatscreen tv. Staff very friendly and there is free parking underground. Have ate in bar once and was disappointed so haven't gone back but colleague says the curry is lovely. Very close to all main shopping streets and there are some lovely restaurants close by. Camden Rotisserie is a favorite of mine. Hotel has swimming pool with lovely jacuzzi and a gym. All in all whilst hotel looks mildly dated its a great place to stay. ,4,2015,01,25
248,Courtesy and Comfort,Unfailing courtesy and help from staff. Very comfortable and clean room - super shower. Excellent buffet breakfast. Underground and free car parking. Fine leisure facilities with pool. Great location for visiting historical and cultural Dublin. C. B. Co. Antrim,4,2015,01,23
248,Dry good value,"Asked for a high floor and got it, quiet large room with all you'd expect, a little walk to get I. To town but not to far and there is a couple of ways to go, say 15 min, as long as you don't stop in one of the many bars on the way.  Similar walk if you get the airport bus service which drops you off at temple bar",5,2015,01,23
248,City Break,"Dublin is certainly a city to enlist on your bucket list. Put it Hugh up, early on your list because you will no doubt want to make a return visit.
Staying at the Camden Court is really a bit of a mixed bag! 
From it's inviting external appearance to the extremely friendly staff this hotel ""could"" be a gem in Dublin!
The rooms are where it all starts on the disappointing trail!
They are extremely small and the decor is tired and needing some fresh TLC.
There is no drinks/light snacks cabinet which is disappointing!
There is nothing to suggest this is the •••• rating it receives!
The breakfast is very good and all freshly made and served by staff.
A good visit to Dublin marred by too many disappointments in our choice of hotel!
C'mon Camden Court you are so close to being a top notch must stay hotel!

",3,2015,01,21
248,excellent service e,"Very friendly and helpful staff, hotel very clean, food good but could have more choice as the restaurant menu and bar snack menu very similar, breakfast excellent. Leisure facilities good grandchildren loved the pool.",5,2015,01,15
248,Good but not great,"A good location you get pretty much everything you'd expect from a hotel of this class - but some curious omissions. The room is well appointed with a big bed and a big screen smart TV, but there's no mini-bar. At breakfast there is a wide choice but no cereal or marmalade. And bizarrely only one flavour of jam - raspberry!
It's in a good location and more than meets your basic needs, but it is not great.",4,2015,01,15
248,Excellent Location,"Stayed in this hotel recently for three nights, very central location for sightseeing , shopping etc. also so many great restaurants to choose from close by. The staff were very professional and friendly too . The rooms very comfortable, quiet and clean. Breakfast was excellent , a great selection to choose from , didn't eat in the restaurant , but it looked good . Would definitely recommend .",4,2015,01,14
248,Very enjoyable stay,"We had a very enjoyable stay at Camden Court. All staff were very welcoming & friendly. Hotel & room were very spacious, clean & well equipped. Food was tasty and service was quick & courteous. Leisure facilities didn't disappoint either - there are few hotels so close to the City Centre with a pool so the leisure facilities were an added bonus. Free secure parking was also a big plus! The area is quiet during the weekends as it is located in a business area of Dublin however, there are loads of attractions on it's doorstep as it's only a short walk or tram ride into the city centre (between 5-10 minutes).  I would definitely stay again at Camden Court & highly recommend it to others.",5,2015,01,13
248,family trip to Dublin,"I was delighted when I booked to find a hotel to fit the 5 of us.
2 adults and 3 children. We got a room with 2 double beds and a single.
The price was good and free car park too.
The room was spotless and perfect for us.
We had a light lunch in the bar it was lovely and staff in general were all very nice.
The children went swimming on Sunday morning the pool area and the girl there were very nice and she was very helpful as our children forgot their goggles and she gave them a loan which was great.
On the negitive side we decided to go for Breakfast. The coffee shops across the road were closed and we only wanted something light. We decided to have breakfast in the Hotel.
The man asked us to pay first and said that will be 45e.... I was like pardon ???
I was not paying 45e for my children who eat like birds and for me to have tea and toast. Yes my Hubby would have a full breakfast but not 45e worth.
He said ok and said he wouldnt charge the children full price. I still had to pay 32e and was not impressed.
Breakfast was very tasty and the room was lovely but I didnt feel comfortable not knowing how much of anything I was allowed for the price I paid. Took the good out of it.
On check out they were lovely again and our car was parked for 45 mins over time but they did not charge us.
Totally enjoyed our stay and will be back again.n Sort breakfast though please.",5,2015,01,12
248,Gets better and better,"Just stayed for the forth time and have to say the hotel gets better every time i have been there. We stayed for 2 nights because of a family funeral. Quite a few of our family stayed there for the first time and were amazed by how good it is.
Clean, comfortable and the staff are so friendly and helpful.
Also, the location of the hotel is just perfect for all the local sites.",5,2015,01,11
248,New Year trip,"Stayed for two nights over New Year with friend. Hotel was in good location, very clean rooms great beds really comfy. All the staff were friendly and helpful especially from the start of our stay. When all electric went out on whole street for an hour on New Years Eve all the staff were great kept us all watered.",5,2015,01,07
248,2nd visit,"Wot can I say stayed 3 nights at camdon court fab hotel fab location ( well we like a walk into town ) walked everyday twice a day . breakfast was fab and served till 11 so get a lie in to !!!!!

But apart from that everything was fab defo use this hotel again but think they need to tighten security",5,2015,01,04
248,Valentines weekend 2014,We got a lovely valentines package with the hotel. They had a lovely pool which we got to use. we thought the staff were lovely. The food at the hotel was lovely and they had a beautiful singer in the background which was roamantic. We can't wait to go back again :),4,2015,01,01
248,short break  in Dublin,"Basically we took an overnight stay in Dublin with our young family ,we arrived approx. 6.00pm Friday evening 19th December good location ,car parking was not so good as drive a VW Caravelle and parking was very tight ,we checked in room was  clean ,and we progressed unto the Panto ,we had enquired about dinning in the restaurant but where told that it was booked with parties etc ,so we arrived back and had a good night sleep and very good breakfast, we used the swimming pool facilities and the kids enjoyed it ,we decided to ask if we could stay in the car park till Saturday evening ,and were told it was 3 Euro per hour ,so my wife had mentioned this to me and \I enquired further to be told no if you check out it was going to cost 3 Euro per hour ,so I had said we arrived at 6,30 the previous evening and why could we not avail of the parking because if we arrived at 1.000pm for check in we would have had more car parking time ,I was told quite hastily that it did not work this way by younger member of staff ,so I enquired again by the duty manager who then had the same approach no it was take it or leave ,this was a bit off putting as we were in the festive season and the two staff where arrogant in there replies ,so any way we checked out and left the feedback card at reception and we witnessed the duty manager read the response and smile and show it to the other member of staff in public view ,the guy we checked out with was called Sebastian pleasant and courteous ,when we did leave the car park we were watched by a car park attendant as if we had done something wrong and the children were question us why was the man watching us , so we went into the city and parked all day hassle free for 12 euro ,shame that staff cannot be more considerate on theses issues ,but we enjoyed the rest of our stay in Dublin ,pity because we take short breaks in Dublin on a regular basis ,",4,2014,12,29
248,Good location ,"Stayed here the weekend before Christmas with the family to see Christmas markets. Good location walking distance to town. Free parking, swimming pool, friendly staff, pub next door. Only negatuve was we found the room very warm. We could only open the windows a crack.  But we would definitely stay again.",4,2014,12,23
248,Great hotel - high quality and good value,"Well located just slightly out of city centre but lots of pubs nearby - an easy walk to st stephens green
Nice clean rooms - comfy large beds - tv kettle etc - no robes - good breakfast and nice lobby area

Great pub attached and kekab house across the street - bith recommended

Hotel was closing on our checkout day but held onto luggage for ys anyway so that was appreciated",4,2014,12,21
248,Convenient location,"Stayed in the Camden Court for one night only .Nice room but it really smelled of cigarette smoke. This was a pity as it would discourage us from staying here again. We hadn't complained as we were only staying one night anyway but on checking out we were told had we brought it to their attention a room change could have been organised. Breakfast was nice but bacon a little overcooked. Fortunately for us a cleaner was just outside our bedroom door on our return from breakfast as our key refused to open the door. This was at 9.15 am. Good location, prompt check in and out. Pleasant staff at reception. Lovely food in the bar & keenly priced. Brilliant shower. But the smell of smoke in the room was a bit of a negative for me. (Sorry) 
",3,2014,12,20
248,Great place to explore Dublin,"We went here for my birthday this year and flew in from Luton with RyanAir. We got ourselves a three day bus pass which includes travel too and from the airport and this provided us with a great way to get around the city for the rest of the week. We got breakfast from the little Tesco Express which is 100 yards away and explored for our 2 night stay. 

The hotel was clean, well run and apart from the key cards not working on the first day offered everything we could have wanted. We used the pool and jacuzzi and were very impressed (apart from the swimming hats you have to wear)

I would recommend the Croke Park tour, and we found some great bars with live music as well.",4,2014,12,19
248,1 night break,"Just spent a very enjoyable weekend in Dublin , only spent 1 night in the hotel but thought it was very good. Had room on 5th floor facing rear so nice and quiet only complaint the lighting in bathroom not great only two down lights.Apart from that bed great and very comfortable.Breakfast very good and great selection,Staff all very helpful so will be back for a two night stay, then can try out the pool and sauna.",4,2014,12,14
248,Great hotel,"Stayed here for all Ireland football weekend. It was a lovely hotel with spacious rooms. Within walking distance to the main shopping streets in Dublin and Croke Park, Camden court is also located very close to famous clubs such as coppers and dtwo which are highly recommended during the GAA Championship. There is a luas tram stop located just outside the hotel which can be used to travel around Dublin, in particular out to Dundrum. This would be a good hotel for a weekend away with friends and equally so with a family as the leisure center is in great condition. My only complaint would be the staff. They were not the most approachable and tended to look quite fed up and it seemed like to answer a simple request was a huge task for some of them in reception. Other than that it is an excellent hotel and would stay here again.",4,2014,12,11
248,perfect for shopping and night life.,"great location, 5minutes walk from Stephen's green, great bars and restaurants in the area, also has an indoor pool which is unusual for a city centre hotel,  nice bar food and music in bar the Friday night I was there.",5,2014,12,09
248,Very nice hotel,"Lovely stay at camden court. Really comfortable bed, close to center (15min walk to temple bar). Loads of bars and restaurants around. Nice staff, Clean rooms, free car park, good wifi. Nice decor in rooms. Swimming pool and jacuzzi was a plus",5,2014,12,03
248,Can't Fault It!,"The rooms were very homely and comfortable, awesome showers, the spa was lovely and although it states swimming caps to be worn, you don't actually have to! It was about a 20 minute walk from the centre but there were a few bars and nice restaurants around that were great!",5,2014,12,03
248,Really satisfied,"I am back to Camden Court for the third time, and I am still really satisfied. Centrally located, nice rooms and really great breakfast. I use the Luas for transport when I am in Dublin, and there is a Luas station only 3 minutes from the hotel. The service is also excellent. I will come back.",5,2014,11,29
248,Lovely Mid week Break,"We have stayed in the Camden before and as usual it was excellent, the staff are lovely, extremely helpful and nothing is too much trouble for them.  There was a problem with the radiator in our room and immediately we were given a different room.  We only had breakfast in the hotel but it was excellent and the atmosphere in the hotel is very relaxing. The location is very good, central to city centre, Christmas market in Stephens Green is on at the minute and is a lovely way to spend an evening.  We will certainly be back!!!",4,2014,11,24
248,Fantastic stay!,"We stayed here 5 years ago and decided to go again after seeing a good deal. If anything the hotel has got better. Helpful and friendly reception staff, fresh clean lovely rooms with big tv! Fantastic shower! The leisure facility are a highlight and I loved the pool! I would visit again! Great hotel!",5,2014,11,23
248,Camden court hotel,"Wow! Had a great time here. We stayed for 3 nights 16,17 and 18th November.   A perfect location that is far enough out of the city ( 10 mins walk from temple bar ) that gives you peace and quiet at nightime. A very clean and well presented hotel, staff are polite and professional.  We turned up at 11 am to leave our bags in the secure area and they advised that our room was ready and was able to check in straight away. Breakfast was lovely and check out was very quick and easy.  I would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone and will be back as soon as i can. Thank you for making our city break so much more than we expected. ",5,2014,11,21
248,Perfectly situated ,"Clean, Quiet and Central. Restaurant and Bar on premises for those days that you don't feel like walking around. 

Easy access to public transport and a quick walk to St Stephens Green Park and Shopping Center  / Coffee Shops / Restaurants and of course Awesome Bars :)! Temple Bar 10 minute walk. 

Staff are friendly and overall a just a good place to stay. ",4,2014,11,14
248,couples weekend,"Booked this weekend break through ` The Irish News ` readers holidays for a two night break. Excellent value for money as always. Love this hotel, as its free parking, clean rooms  and handy location make it a great choice. My Only concern on this trip was the fact we we subjected to a large group of women arriving into the breakfast room dressed only in their PYJAMAS!!!( probably a hen group! The staff didn`t really know what to do and seemed a little bemused!! In feel in future there needs to be a dress code ( even at breakfast) Hence only giving it 4 stars...",4,2014,11,13
248,Love being in city center,We stayed here while touring with a band we follow.  We had an overnight flight that brought us in very early.  They did their best to accommodate some seriously weary travelers.  Staff is always helpful.  The breakfasts were delicious.  The rooms were tidy and well kept.  The bonus of this hotel is The Bleeding Horse Pub next door.  That place is wonderful.  I would definitely stay here again.,5,2014,11,11
248,Great location,"Another work trip, but this time I needed a hotel with parking for the hire car. Tick!
Small, but perfectly formed rooms.
Very helpful staff.
Lovely buffet breakfast which could only have been improved with self service for speed
Walkable to Grafton Street
All in all I was happy",4,2014,11,11
248,Perfect for our needs,"We visited Dublin for an Ireland match and decided we would make a full weekend of it. We were on a morning flight and arrived in the city at 11am - the Aircoach drop-off and pick-up points are each about 5-10 minutes from the hotel but easy to find. Our intention was to leave our luggage at the hotel whilst we went for a wander and to check-in later but when we arrived they had a room ready so we were set to go. Everything about the checking-in and checking-out processes was very smooth and the staff we dealt with were friendly and helpful.
The room had everything we needed - the bed was a little soft for our liking but perfectly ok for a three night break. The bathroom was clean and had a really powerful shower.
The location is brilliant - we were less than a 10 minute walk from the main shopping streets and very conveniently placed to walk in the opposite direction towards the Aviva. However, the hotel is far enough away from the main streets so that it is very peaceful.
We only had breakfast in the hotel on our last morning but we were really impressed with the variety on offer and the quality of the food.
The pub next door (The Bleeding Horse) was great, it's got a brilliant range of craft beers, very friendly staff and a great atmosphere. We also ended up eating in a restaurant just around the corner - 'Aussie BBQ' - which was fantastic!
I will definitely be looking to book this place for future Dublin trips.",5,2014,11,11
248,Great centrally located hotel ,"Have stayed here a few times now. Great location, rooms are very quiet, clean and comfortable. They do great Guinness in the bar and the lobby is a nice area to sit and relax. It's tucked in off the street and walking distance to Temple Bar and loads of greats pubs and clubs. Great rates too.",4,2014,11,08
248,Some parking advice,"This is my hotel of choice in Dublin. I've stayed here loads of times for all kinds of reasons and have reviewed it before so won't go into all that again. But last month I stayed and wa so happy to arrive after my long drive that I just dumped the car in the first parking space I saw, in full view of the parking attendant - we exchanged smiles and I went to check In at Reception. I then went out for the evening, met my friend who drove me back to the hotel & parked her car beside mine & checked in. As usual we passed a very pleasant night at the hotel and as we checked out on the Monday morning, the lovely lady in reception offered to validate my ticket. I explained I didn't have one. Turns out that I parked outside the hotel carpark barrier in an area subject to clamping!! Luckily neither of us were clamped but it took about 270 turns of the wheel to get out as we were so blocked in! Next time I'll park INSIDE the barrier. Turns out the parking attendant had absolutely no connection to the hotel....",5,2014,11,08
248,Nice hotel,The lobby area and restaurant were very nice and the reception staff were polite and efficient. The bed was comfortable and the bathroom good. It would have been better if there had been some conditioner as well as shampoo. The bedroom carpet left a lot to be desired and the tv was side on to the bed but then I was given a family room with three beds!! The breakfast had a very good selection and would suit all tastes.,4,2014,11,07
248,A lot to be desired,"I booked this hotel due to the description on the website and the pictures. Imagine my disappointment when I turn up and the room is NOTHING like what I anticipated. 

There where 2 queen beds in the room (I had booked a double), one was hard as a rock the other was like laying in jelly. The heating was on, I couldn't turn it off due to the temperature of the radiator and age. The windows didn't properly open and there was no AC. 

There where no plugs next to the bed and it was a struggle to find somewhere to plug in more than 1 item. 

The pool area is in need to an upgrade, the tiles are falling off the walls and it looks shabby and dated. 

The breakfast was good, although the service for getting coffee awful. I had to ask 3 times and each time I was told, someone will be over. 

Location might be great but I wouldn't stay here for that.",2,2014,11,07
248,Great stay,"The hotel is in a good location with many restaurants and shops within walking distance.
The rooms where nice and clean.
The hotel has a gym and a small swimming pool.
The staff was very helpful and the overal service was very good",5,2014,11,04
248,Lovely hotel,"I can defiantly recommend this hotel
Nice rooms, very clean, friendly staff, breakfast spot on
Slept well
half an hour walk to centre of Dublin but plenty of taxis's for 10 euros one way
On the whole, great stay",5,2014,11,04
248,The Real Deal Says 5 Stars! Are you on Crack? Pay 90 Euros No More.,"Several people rated this hotel 5 stars.  They need to stop comparing this to camping.  That said if you can get this hotel for under 95 Euros it probably makes sense otherwise look again.  The hotel is 3 at best.  The entrance and the lobby are quite nice although every time I went through them there were 50 people from a low cost tour standing around looking for a bus.  The issue is they all come back at 9:30 and 40 at a time come down your hall way.  Everything in the room is either cheap or basic.  A step above student dorm room.  BTW they turn the heat off at 10PM so make sure you have blankets according to the front desk.  I posted pictures of the hallway, the door, the working desk, the nightstand and the bathroom to show the quality.  Help me with how any of this is 4 stars.  Also the room is small.  I do not know who calls these spacious rooms but really there is less than half a metere on one side of the bed and no room for a chair and going to the bathroom in the space below the bed.  The breakfast is very good, I did not try other meals because it is surrounded by cheap restaurants.  The quiet room I had overlooked the back car park which has people going at all times 5Am trash pickups and a loud generator of some kind.. The area is probably one of the least nice tourist locations although it is only a 16 block walk to the area to do things.  Overall this is at best a 2.5 star hotel the only thing 4 stars is the mat which says it when you come in.",2,2014,11,02
248,Lovely hotel and excellent restaurant,"This is a very reasonably priced hotel. It has good amenities including a gym, swimming pool and sauna. We decided to eat in the restaurant on our first night which was excellent. It is in a good location and despite several hen parties was quiet.
Would stay again.",4,2014,10,31
248,Spot on,"Spent two nights at the Camden Court in September 2014. The room was nice and big and bathroom clean and tidy. We overlooked the carpark area and that got quite loud in the mornings, deliveries etc but easily tolerated. It got quite warm so having the window open increased the noise issue as there was no aircon.
The breakfasts in the mornings were fantastic, whatever your preference, cooked/continental, it's there. Staff are helpful and very nice.
Location is perfect, just a short walk to all the bits you need to come and see.",4,2014,10,31
248,Enjoyable Mini-Break,"Stayed here for 2 nights midweek. Room 242 at back of hotel was very clean, comfortable and quiet. Smart TV great. Power shower great. Safe is located at ground level in room and awkward to access. Bath towels not big enough! Breakfast had a good choice. However one of our party is diabetic and found the low fat yogurts to be too high in sugar content.",4,2014,10,31
248,Decent,"I have often been in the Camden Court for work related things - meetings, conferences, training events etc and it has always been successful.

Recently I was invited to the Halloween event with a 3 course dinner and the food and service were both really good.

I also had lunch in the bar this week and the food was great and reasonably priced. I was with a coeliac friend who had plenty of option to choose from and was happy with the tasty food. 

Great, quiet spot to grab a bite to eat.",3,2014,10,31
248,Brilliant hotel,"Really can't fault it. My room was brand new, massive and quiet on the 5th floor. Compared to city hotels across Europe it's brilliant in terms of space and quality. We had a corporate event there and the facilities and food were spot on. Staff were polite and not intrusive. Great location, high quality food, free wifi...what more could you want?",5,2014,10,31
248,Great place to stay,"Stayed here for the October bank holiday weekend. What a lovely hotel to stay in! Great room, fabulous breakfast with a great choice and really lovely welcoming staff. Also great to get free parking for guests.  Very handy for walking to the centre for the nightlife.  ",5,2014,10,30
248,Can't fault it!,"We stayed in this hotel for a long weekend in October celebrating a friend's 50th birthday. The room and bathroom were modern and clean and the staff were all very helpful. The gym looked recently refurbished - I didn't use it!! - and the pool and spa area was a gem. The hotel is a 15 minute walk from the centre of Dublin but there are plenty of bars and restaurants very close by - even one right next door which we would recommend. A great choice of hot and cold food for breakfast and the queues were minimal thanks to the well organised, hard working staff. ",5,2014,10,29
248,Great stay for the Marathon,We stayed here for three nights whilst their for the Dublin Marathon. Front desk staff were very helpful particularly Magda and Pawel. Rooms were very clean and well set out. Breakfasts were well stocked and of good quality. The hotel is only 5 minutes walk from St Stephens Green (although it took me double that having just completed 26.2) so is very accessible. All in all a good stay.,4,2014,10,28
248,Excellent apart from poor door soundproofing.,"This hotel was excellent, great room, unbelievably good breakfast (hot plates...yes!). the sound proofing on the doors was non existent, the bed could have been in the corridor. people walking past  laughing and shouting till 3am, people are so bloody inconsiderate.",4,2014,10,28
248,Overall very impressed,"Stayed here for the night before the marathon. Great location with ample/safe parking. Very clean  nice rooms. Everything we asked for wasn't too much trouble. Put breakfast on at 6am for marathon goers, would say porridge wasn't made very well, very watery but that maybe personal preference. Overall really enjoyed it and wouldn't hesitate to recommend. Magda on Front Desk was first class. One negative, staff were chewing gum on reception and again in the bar and for me its a big no no. Other than that cant fault it!!!",5,2014,10,27
248,Take a pass,Stayed here 2 nights. Hotel lobby and dining room are very nice and the breakfast is good. Some rooms gave been refurbished but ours wasn’t and it was in desperate need of updating. The furniture looked a bit old and tired but the room itself was large. The first morning we had to take cold showers as there was no hot water in the hotel. This was pure misery.  Not located in a great area.  Front desk staff was snotty.  There are much better hotels in Dublin. Take a pass on this hotel.,2,2014,10,27
248,Very friendly!~,"We first stayed at the Conrad which was fantastic, but prices are steep.  So we moved to the Camden Court and it was very quant. The rooms were much smaller but they offer FREE wifi, which the Conrad didn't even provide.  Also, the staff at Camden was very helpful.  There's a little pub next to it called the Bleeding Horse, great spot to hang out after a long day of sightseeing!",4,2014,10,25
248,Great hotel let down by poor breakfast,"If the cooked breakfast had been to the same standard as the rest of the hotel this would have been a four star. My room was spacious and comfortable. It was on the back of the hotel so away from street noise although there was some construction going on till 9:00 pm every night. The bed was two singles strapped together which wasn't a problem for me as a single occupant. Generally storage was adequate, there was a good WiFi signal in the room, and the standard of cleanliness was excellent. Although I think the room and bathroom had been refurbished, there were a couple of slightly tatty bits in the bathroom like a badly fitting bath panel but nothing major. The hotel is well located being just a short walk from the bars and restaurants in Temple Bar and is handy for lots of public transport. So the only problem was the cooked breakfast. I have to be honest and say that I don't understand the complimentary reviews of the breakfast at this hotel. I admit that the cold offering was very good with freshly pressed orange juice and very tasty croissants as well as cereals, fruit, meats and cheese etc. But I had really been looking forward to a proper Irish breakfast and was badly disappointed. The first oddity was that although the cooked breakfast was laid out buffet style, it wasn't self service so it felt like one of the department store cafés where you choose 5 items for €5 or whatever. The first morning I had the scrambled egg, black and white pudding and mushrooms. It was vile. The puddings had been deep fried to death and barely resembled the real thing, the mushrooms were half raw and the eggs leathery. I had a cold breakfast on day 2 but then tried the cooked on day 3. This time I had a fried egg, sausages, bacon and hash browns. The egg and bacon were fine but the sausages were skinny little apologies and the hash browns cold. This is such a shame as I don't think it would take much to improve the breakfast offering. So in conclusion I would definitely recommend the hotel but perhaps on a room only basis and get your breakfast from one of the many eateries close by.",3,2014,10,21
248,Very comfortable stay,"The hotel is clean and bright and the beds are very comfortable.  The staff is friendly and helpful, and the breakfast is really, really good.  It's in a good location, within walking distance to Trinity College and other sites.",4,2014,10,18
248,Road trip adventurers,"Spent two nights at the Camden Court, ten days apart, at the beginning and end of a road trip around Ireland. The room was nice and big, enough space for the three of us to not feel cramped. The rooms probably do need a bit updating but the bathrooms were updated. The breakfast in the mornings were fantastic, whatever your preference, cooked/continental, it's there. The staff were very helpful in giving directions and suggestions for possible options for food. Twenty minute walk from Temple Bar region and safe enough to walk at night (we were three girls). Would definitely return.",4,2014,10,18
248,Definitely a keeper!,The rooms were clean and well appointed. It was quiet even with large tour groups going in and out while I was there. I found the bed to be very comfortable and slept well all 3 nights I stayed there. The location was perfect for pedestrian sightseeing. I travel alone and felt very safe here. I will definitely stay here again when I visit Dublin. ,4,2014,10,15
248,Home from Home Luxury,"I had a really great weekend staying here in March, the staff were so helpful and pleasant with that great Dublin warmth that we found everywhere. The rooms were clean warm and well made up and looked after. Great Irish breakfasts every morning! I even ate alone on one occasion in the evening and felt perfectly comfortable and the meal was fantastic. If travelling to Dublin alone I would certainly stay here again. Its slightly away from the main area of pubs and restaurants, so might not suit those in a party frame of mind, but we loved it! Its also near to the Concert Hall which was really handy.",5,2014,10,14
248,Made to feel welcome,"Stayed there for a few days with my girlfriend. Terrific room, great breakfast and very clean. Staff very helpful and made us both feel very welcome. I would recommend this hotel to anyone. Would certainly go back.",5,2014,10,14
248,Disappointed,"We rang all the way fro Australia requesting a quiet room
Note reservations 
Yes you gave us a room away from the street noise although a quiet room is not!
Near a lift where people walk past late at night and early in the morning banging their doors
Or a room next to another that is being renovated 
Or near a drink machine that buzz's all night
Also the heater did not work

The manger tried to find us another room although they where just as close to the lift and smelt musty",3,2014,10,14
248,Comfortable and in good location,"We stayed here for one night and found it to be clean and comfortable and about fifteen minutes walk from Temple bar area. The car park is quite small and a bit tight but we managed to find a space and the car remained there until check out next day. Ticket is validated on leaving by reception staff so that there is no charge. Check in was quick, not overly friendly but efficient and breakfast times and use of leisure facilities were explained. Our double room was smaller than I expected but comfortable. The bathroom didnt seem to be one of the refurbished ones but as it was for one night only we didnt mind. Good sized tv with a good variety of channels. I would have liked extra blankets to have been available in the wardrobe as when we got back in the early hours of the morning the room was chilly. We turned the radiator on and it did warm up quite quickly. We were on the 5th floor and didnt hear any outside noise. Breakfast was very nice although I do prefer to serve myself rather than have staff behind a hot counter serve it up. It got really busy around 9.30am. The hotel reception and bar area are very nice, the rooms, or the room we had, possibly not just so luxurious. We would stay here again as the location was good and there are bars and restaurants just outside if desired.",4,2014,10,13
248,Camden Court Hotel,"Both my girlfriend and I stayed a total of 8 days over the course of a couple of weeks and had absolutely 0 negative experiences here. Everyone was friendly and extremely welcoming, and it was more than a relief to return after having issues at another hotel. Absolutely beautiful bar with smiling and more than helpful staff, especially the best barman in the world Tadhg Gallagher. This man knows his stuff and is all around a great person in general. 

Amazing accommodations upstairs as well as a in house restaurant in the lobby, and a bar to match. If you're staying long enough to make some friends and have an awesome bar experience :

ASK FOR TADHG GALLAGHER!",5,2014,10,13
248,GreatStay,"Nice rooms, decorated very nicely.  Bathroom modern.  Food breakfast bar fantastic.  
Close and convenient to shopping areas.  Close enough to Grafton Street where all the shopping
villages and pubs are located.  Nice walk.  You can walk to a lot of things from there.",4,2014,10,01
248,Comfortable and welcoming,"My room was clean and comfortable, if slightly on the small side. The hotel staff were polite and helpful. The hotel is well situated for the city centre bars and restaurants. Ideal in many ways if, like me, your hotel is just somewhere to sleep and shower.",4,2014,09,28
248,Top Notch Customer Service,"Great location about 10 minutes to Grafton Street. Excellent breakfast, very personable and efficient front desk staff. Rooms were spotless and beds very comfortable.  Lovely restaurant with relaxing atmosphere and pub provided live entertainment.",5,2014,09,26
248,Great for a base,"We stayed here for one night as we were attending an event in Grafton Street .  It was easy to get from the train station to quite near the hotel .  The hotel was modern and comfortable and check in was fast and efficient. The room a twin was fine and quiet as we requested.  We were also told if we booked breakfast before bedtime it would be at a reduced rate.  We did this quite late but it wasn't a problem
As the weather had taken a turn for the worse we had a light lunch in the hotel sandwiches and pizza which were fine and reasonably priced 
We did take a taxi back when we returned at1130 as we weren't very sure of the area it was easier and was again reasonably priced for the short journey.  
I would use this as a base again as the staff were polite and helpful requests were dealt with efficiently and the room and breakfast were of a high standard",4,2014,09,24
248,"Comfort without ""Luxury""","This a business hotel with a fine staff. Public rooms are open and comfortable. The breakfast was my favorite of this trip: Enough smoked salmon to satisfy my desires, fresh eggs cooked to order, fresh orange juice, great coffee with real cream, and efficient friendly service.

The rooms were adequate with good beds. We were on the 6th floor at the back where it was quiet.
Front rooms face a busy street.

Good pubs and transportation hub. Starbucks around the corner. St. Stephen's Green a short walk.",5,2014,09,23
248,Really nice,"The hotel itself are one of the better I have visited in the islands. The people working there are warm and friendly and always ready to do the best for you. A wery nice pool/sauna/jacuzzi area, and a good gym.
The restaurant was good and they had a good breakfast. 
The area around are relatively quiet,  but you find a wery good pub in ""The Bleeding Horse"" next door. And there is not a long walk to either nightclubs, food/restaurants or more pubs. 
I would absolutely consider this hotel if or when I go to Dublin again, and its highly recommended for anyone from families to a bunch of friends (which we were :-)",5,2014,09,23
248,Fantastic Location,"Stayed at the hotel for 2 nights , fantastic location , in walking distance to the centre of Dublin and all the sights and tours. Hotel and room to a high standard . Staff very polite and helpful. Would definately stay again , when we next visit Dublin.",5,2014,09,22
248,Beautiful Hotel,Stayed here for two nights while on a vacation in Ireland. The property is conveniently located near Temple Bar in downtown Dublin. The room was really nice but a bit noisy. It was good location for sightseeing. The downstairs lobby is absolutely gorgeous. Highly recommend this hotel.,5,2014,09,21
248,Basic but perfectly adequate,"I recently spent two nights at the camden court hotel.  I had hoped the rooms would be as luxurious as the lobby, which is lovely. Unfortunately they are not, however, they were spotlessly clean, the bed was comfortable and the shower hot.  The bed linen was clean and there were plenty of towels, and plenty of tea and coffee.  Everything worked and I think a new carpet and a lick of paint would really freshen the bedrooms. I asked for an inward facing room away from the main road as advised by other tripadvisors, which I was given, and slept well.",4,2014,09,21
248,Just became a 4 star hotel,"I stayed at the hotel for 1 night with my guests after finishing a tour of Ireland. We were given the service you had wished for and even more than that. The staff was doing a great job and I would recommend this hotel to anyone. The location is ideal, close to the city center, and the hotel room is very nice. Keep up the good work!",5,2014,09,18
248,Great place to stay!,"My mother and I spent 4 nights here and we had a great experience.

The location is perfect to getting anywhere in the city! It's within walking distance to so much stuff, but it's not in the middle of anything so it was nice and quiet at night. 

The breakfast offered was also really good. Not just hotel good, but really good by any standards. 

Our room was clean and the bathroom was nice. I feel in love with the long bathtub. (compared to what we have here in the US) We were given the wi-fi information upon arrival and it worked great. 

The only problem we had was we asked for a wake up call and never got it, but luckily we set both of our phones and everything ended up okay.

I highly recommend stopping by The Bleeding Horse that is right next door as well for a meal and a pint.",4,2014,09,18
248,Perfect Location for a city break...,"This hotel is just perfect for a city break. Pool and spa area could do with a refurb and breakfast is a bit all over the place but for us they were minor discrepancies as the staff, room and service were fantastic. It is so easy to travel around Dublin from this hotel it was just right for our visit.",4,2014,09,16
248,Breakfast is a bit of a shambles,"I wouldn't stay at this hotel again simply for the fiasco at breakfast.

I stayed their for two nights on a business trip.

Breakfast
1) They do not show you to your table and you therefore have to hunt for one especially during busy times.
2) Given no one shows you to your table you are not offered tea or coffee and have to hope someone will ask you.
Second day took 20 mins to receive a cup of coffee and this was only served when I asked if it would be too much trouble.
3) I leave my table which has toast and orange juice on it to go and get some breakfast.  You have to queue for eggs/bacon etc and then yu are served.  This therefore once again can take time.  When I arrived back at my table it was being cleared.  Waitress apologised but again shows no organisation in terms of what tables are being occupied.
4) Some people arriving for breakfast had to wait as it was that busy.
5) There were a number of reserved breakfast tables not sure if this costs more but I would certainly look into this if I was travelling in a large party.

Generally though staff were very polite and helpful.",3,2014,09,15
248,"Great Hotel, great location","Stayed there Saturday night, What a lovely comfy hotel. Rooms were nice and big. It has a carpark, which just made our day.  Staff were amazing and fierce helpful, they looked after our bags when we checked out on Sunday and we actually had a good laugh with them, I didn't have a chance to see the pool etc, but if I was going to Dublin again id definitely stay here. Reasonable rates, food was delicious in the bar. Bar staff were fierce helpful, slowing us to charge our phones behind the bar. I was really impressed.",5,2014,09,15
248,"Nice rooms, great location, good service","A lot of renovations have taken place in Camden over the weeks to further improve their service and my recent stay here showed just how much these renovations have improved Camden.

The hotel is one of those with a homey and classic ambiance upon entry. It is not an ultra modern hotel.

The rooms were lovely. I have been staying here intermittently over the year and have tried most of their rooms and although some rooms are smaller than the others, I find that they are consistently clean and cozy. During winter, the heating might be troublesome though because although you can change the temperature, it still doesn't seem to be fully in your control.. i think it might be slightly centralized. In summer, there is no airconditioning in the rooms - although this is seldom a problem in Ireland as weather here is generally cool (except during a heatwave...but why would you be stuck in your hotel room on a bright, sunny day??)

Breakfast is superb. I usually have the buffet in their restaurant. Dinners there are great too (but there are better restaurants to try around Dublin!)

Location. Well, it's around two minutes walk to the green line Luas (tram) and I'd say around 15 minutes walk to Grafton street. 

Over-all, Camden exceeds expectations and deserves its 4-star status.",4,2014,09,13
248,"Service, service, service","My girlfriend, her daughter and I just got back from a fantastic trip to Ireland and the first place we stayed while we were there was the Camden Court Hotel in Dublin. Its in a very convenient location with plenty to do/see and eat close by. Excellent shopping as well. All the places I'm going to tell you about we would have not known about or found with out the excellent customer service of Magda. I hope I spelled that correctly. She absolutely made our stay there at the Camden Court. Always patient, always informative, funny, outgoing....I cant say enough about her and my girlfriends daughter compared everyone to her at the other 5 places we stayed at in Ireland and although all the others were nice and helpful, she said none compared to Magda. We all felt the same. She's the one that told us about all these places and then some. I'd highly recommend a walk down to Grafton  St. where you will find plenty of shopping and entertainment on the street. That was fun. Then at night, its a little bit of a walk but not too bad, maybe 15-20 min but go down to the Temple Bar area. Ton's of bars, live music everywhere and people out walking the streets having a good time. The only problem I had there was trying to figure out which bar to go to since they all looked like so much fun. Another place to go that has great music and performers doing Irish Folk Dancing is the Arlington Hotel. The Jameson distillery tour was a lot of fun as was the Guinness tour. The best part about the Guinness tour was the view at the top while drinking a pint of Guinness...very nice.  One last humorous note, when we left the hotel we told Magda we hoped everywhere we stayed on our trip we'd find someone as nice and helpful as she was....she said we wouldn't...she was the only one. We thought the same thing at the end of our trip. Keep up the great work. We cant say enough about her and the hotel. Oh and the food is AWESOME at the restaurant there. Signup for the Irish breakfast if you book!!  Loved the pool/sauna/hottub also...very well kept and very clean. We'd definitely stay at the Camden Court again.",5,2014,09,12
248,Lovely hotel,Recently stayed at Camden court hotel. The hotel was very clean and the staff very friendly. As we had an early flight we arrived at the hotel early. Check in was at 2pm but as the room was free they let us check in early with no charge which was nice. Good location 15 min walk from city centre. We had the buffet breakfast one morning this was 13 euros food was lush! would really recommend this hotel!,4,2014,09,10
248,Great city centre hotel,Without doubt my favorite hotel to stay in the centre of Dublin. Have stayed many times on business and with the family. Would highly recommend to anyone. Good location and facilities. Rooms and bar areas newly decorated. Staff are really excellent. Parking under ground and rates are usually pretty good. ,5,2014,09,08
248,Great hotel good facilities fantastic staff,"I have stayed here many times now and cannot recommend it enough. There are different standards of room but the newly refurbished ones are great. The hotel also has a free gym, pool, steam room and sauna which are great after a long day. All the staff I've had dealings with are fantastic and do all they can to help. The hotel restaurant is lovely and room service is also delicious. The hotel is close enough to walk into Dublin centre or right outside is the Luas tram which is great to hop on to travel further a field.",5,2014,09,08
248,Overpriced,"Stayed here at the weekend...rooms are lovely but definitely not worth  €170 per night and then we went down for breakfast the next morning and was charged another €13.50 for breakfast which was  only mediocre and all i had was a slice of toast and a cup of tea...definitely better value in Dublin, go elsewhere",3,2014,09,03
248,Pleasant  stay,"Stayed for 3 nights midweek and as usual was very happy with the service, staff and facilities. The only drawback was that the TV was so big it obscured the mirror and the hair dryer flex was so short that it was difficult to dry my hair and use the mirror at the same time. A minor complaint which could be rectified easily. I spent so little time in the room (500) that I didn't bring it to the attention of staff during my stay. Great location within reasonable walking distance of the cities many bars, restaurants and shops. A very pleasant stay.",4,2014,09,02
248,"Great hotel, close to the city.","I recently spent three nights in this property. I requested a refurbished room in which I received. Check in and check out was done quick, with a pleasant front office team.
The room was very clean and comfortable. I liked the decor. There is no air con, it got rather hot at night, so had to leave the window open.
Wifi is free, but a little slow at times.
The breakfast was good and breakfast staff were very efficient.
I liked the location, nice walk into town! Would definitely stay again. ",4,2014,09,02
248,just fine for a weekend visit,"Liked the location as there are plenty of restaurants on lower Camden. Not much shopping at all. The hotel does have a nice pool and jacuzzi, good Irish breakfast (for 13 euros a person) and the Bleeding Horse pub sports bar will have whatever match is showing. Rooms are average, comfortable. WiFi is usually working OK and is free. Overall good value.

Front desk staff are very helpful, although sometimes misinformed. We almost missed seeing Trinity College because we were told it is closed on weekends.",4,2014,09,01
248,Perfectly pleasant stay,"I went for 2 nights with my husband for a weekend break and the hotel suited this trip. There is little to complain about here. The hotel was very nice, clean and had everything we needed. The room itself was very clean, as was the bathroom. The bed was bigger than king size and really comfortable and we had an excellent night's sleep. The only thing that affected this was the room temperature. There was no air conditioning in the room so we couldn't regulate it, however even with the window open there were no noise issues so slept well. Plenty of storage in the room, a smart TV, and a good sized room for our needs. The bathroom was well equipped with nice towels and some toiletries. The shower was lovely and powerful too. Cleaners came in each morning and were super efficient!

We only ate at the hotel for breakfast but it was really good. A large range of food, well cooked, plenty of it, and the restaurant was clean and tidy and well staffed. 

Location wise the hotel is a 15 minute walk from Temple Bar. Not the smarter end of town but bustling as you get closer to the centre and plenty of bars and food places to choose from a 5 minute walk away. The hotel bar itself was quiet and didn't seem to have much entertainment on a regular basis so we found that we had to go out to find a bit of life. There was a guy with his guitar playing for a while on the Friday evening but nothing on the Saturday. The bar would be ideal if you just wanted to sit and have a few drinks though so it depends what you are looking for as to whether it would suit you.

Taxis came extremely quickly when called for by reception and the fare to the airport ranged between €20 and €30.",4,2014,08,31
248,Good hotel relatively central,"Stayed with my wife and parents for a couple of nights. Some rooms are refurbished, some not (but still large and comfortable). The first room my parents were given was one of the new ones (2nd floor) and had a very strong smell of paint. The hotel staff were receptive and changed it. 
Locationwise, it's about 15-20 minutes walk from temple area and trinity college. All in all, good choice at a decent price. ",4,2014,08,30
248,"Excellent service, convenient, lovely","This was the 5th hotel we stayed in as part of a tour and we extended our stay for 2 more nights. Imposed on the staff multiple times and they always came through for us.  Our room was clean, quiet,  and comfortable.  We were able to walk easily to  national museums,  Grafton St shopping, and St Steven's Green.   We took a cab for Guiness tour. Breakfast was a cut above the rest in                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         variety and quality. Free Wifi was good. There is a computer terminal on site but there is a charge for useage and an additional fee for printing.  I would stay there again.",5,2014,08,29
248,Pleasant,"We stayed here on our first visit to Dublin for 3 nights.  The hotel is clean and tidy although in desperate need of a facelift in the rooms and hallways.
The bed was a huge comfy king size and relatively new.  Room was a bit dingy, with old burgundy upholstery and draperies.  Bathroom is really outdated and needs MAJOR facelift.
Most of the staff were friendly and helpful, but not always forthcoming with information unless you push for help.
We faced an alley/parking garage, so it was super noisy as window is literally beside the bed, heard the garbage trucks at 1:30am.
Major walking to get to anything, it's always about 15-30 minutes to get somewhere...
Breakfast was excellent every day, although always the same.  Had dinner one night, was quite nice.",3,2014,08,29
248,Fantastic,"What a great hotel!! Its like home from home!! Great staff, lovely food, friendly and could not do enough for you. Leisure centre is clean and service exceptional! (Manager robbie and mags) very welcoming and felt very looked after!! Will definatly be returning and will recommend to anyone! Thank you!!!",5,2014,08,28
248,Lovely stay,"Pleasant stay in  a lovely hotel staff were friendly and helpful. Room was clean znd comfortable and very quiet. Our dinner was excellent well cooked good choice really enjoyable. Well positioned for exploring Dublin , walking distance of the city . Breakfast again was excellent . The two nights we spent here were a good start to our tour of Ireland . And I would not hesitate to use this hotel again and will recommend it to anyone.",4,2014,08,23
248,Not as grand as it looks,"I spent two nights at the Camden Court while visiting Dublin for work.

The hotel is well located, about 10 minutes' walk from St Stephens Green, and maybe 20 to the Temple Bar area.

The hotel check-in was fast and efficient.

The exterior and lobby are very grand, but it did not follow through to the room. The room was spacious and the bathroom was nice, but it was a little sparse, and lacked character. There was nothing wrong with the room, but after the grandeur of the lobby, it was just a bit disappointing.

The hotel has its own bar, which was a little pricey, but great if you do not want to go to far. It also has a restaurant, although I did not visit it.

I had a pleasant enough stay, and would consider staying at this hotel again.",3,2014,08,22
248,“Excellent!!”,"Booked this as a last minute decision and didn't really expect a lot but was really surprised! The staff were really friendly and helpful, will definitely stay here again when we visit Dublin. The rooms were really nice and the bed was one of the comfiest I've stayed in.food in restaurant  was amazing  thanks for great stay",5,2014,08,22
248,"Comfortable but be aware, no AC","Stayed with a tour group.Room spacious ,clean and comfortable. Be aware that there is no air conditioning.Location was fine, 10 min walk into the city.Breakfast was plentiful in both quality and quantity.Staff friendly and helpful.",4,2014,08,19
248,City centre hotel,"What I liked about this hotel:
Good city location near Stephen's Green, a slighly rundown area but also lively and cosmopolitan at the same time.
Fair sized comfortable rooms that had everything you would need for a short stay.  Very clean and well appointed.
Polite, attentive and effiecient staff
Excellant breakfast, even for us veggies.
Lovely spa offering good value packages.
Ample free parking, which is a real bonus in Dublin

What I didn't like about this hotel:
No AC in rooms.
Overpriced vegetarian food in bar (nothing new there), served with warm wine.

What I really didn't like about this hotel:
The see-through bathroom doors.  Save your partner's blushes by leaving the wardrobe doors open (you'll see what I mean).",4,2014,08,19
248,Nice place,"Very close to Stephens Green, just follow the tracks and you're right in the middle of Dublin. Nice and helpful front desk, comfortable and state of the art rooms, and absolutely great breakfast. The, just walk to Grafton street and you're rolling...",5,2014,08,19
248,Nice place no AC,"In our travels we noticed a lot of hotels didn't have AC, along with a comfortable bed we look for a place with air conditioning. That aside it's a lovely place with a wonderful staff. The morning breakfast is very nice and tasty! Not a far walk from all the major places we wanted to see. If you don't mind the lack of AC this place is just fine for a nice trip to Dublin. ",3,2014,08,18
248,Great hotel,"I visit Dublin at least 3 times a year and always stay at Camden Court, on business, with family and with friends.  The facilities are excellent, the reception and restaurant staff are helpful and polite, the food is consistently good. Bar staff are superb John, Tony and Darren make sure you are well looked after and are the perfect hosts. 
I would recommend this hotel to anyone visiting Dublin, it is only a short walk to the city centre or the luas stops just around the corner.   Im looking forward to my next visit in october.",5,2014,08,18
248,Lovely director,"The hotel is quite well situated, but is Being renovated so if you don't get one of the new rooms, the other a are quite old. Staff in the recepción and in the swimming-pool are quite unpleasant! Waiters in breakfast are nice, and food very good",3,2014,08,15
248,Brilliant stay in Dublin,Great stay perfect for a few drinks and cocktails bar man Darren was magnificent such a patient young hard working lad food A1 hotel under going renovation but still had a pleasant stay and sleep location ideal easy walk into city centre variety of pubs and attraction to see,5,2014,08,13
248,Good.,"Professional check in. Pleasant lobby and bar
Decent sized room (316) but too near the elevator lobby and on the side of the main road. Noisy!
Staff pleasant. Good breakfast. 
Near to the centre
Overall good.",3,2014,08,12
248,Comfortable hotel close to the city centre,"I would consider this to be a city centre hotel, but it is a good 15 minute walk to Trinity College, for example.
Unusually for the city centre, there's a free carpark for hotel guests - this is a fabulous and rare benefit and makes the rates for accommodation even more favourable.
I'm not sure how old the hotel is, but the corridors look a bit shabby.  Rooms were comfortable, if snug.  No minibar in the room.  Complimentary toiletries and nice big shower over bath.  However, if you're taller than 175cm, you might need to duck to get under the shower.
No AC - but staff delivered a fan within minutes of it being requested - and it was needed. Windows do open.
Didn't eat in the hotel, but restaurant area looked pleasant.  Hotel has a small pool, gym and beauty salon in the basement - again, not something you expect in such a good location for the city.
Had a few drinks in the bar - staff were great, but it's not lively - there are so many bars, restaurants and clubs in the vicinity I can't imagine it's ever busy.
All staff were friendly, helpful and efficient.
One quirk, which seems to be more prevalent now is that if you have a late breakfast on the morning you check-out and don't get back to your room before 12pm, you'll have to go to reception to get your key re-actived - not a fault of the hotel, understand why they do it, but it's just a bit frustrating - and very common in Irish hotels.",4,2014,08,11
248,Lovely,"Comfortable room, quiet floor, comfortable huge bed, about 15-20 minute walk from center of town at a comfortable pace, breakfast in hotel restaurant was expensive but absolutely to die for. Bathroom a little small but a good powerful shower which we like. Lovely lobby and friendly staff. 
We were woken up at 8am by housekeeping on our checkout day even though checkout was 12pm. No idea why but we didn't ask at reflection either. There were no charges for us so might have just been an accident. ",5,2014,08,09
248,Nice standard hotel,"Very nice average hotel.  No complaints.  Stayed hear with Trafalgar tours, 2 nights split.  Very good breakfast.  Perfect for an overnight stop.  Not very close to all the Dublin attractions.  I would stay closer to the pub district if I went again.",3,2014,08,08
248,Great after the change of room,"James at the front desk was very helpful checking us in and telling us about the facilities. Went to get in the lift and after waiting a minute or 2 for one to come about 6 members of the hotel's management staff pushed in leaving no room for us or any other guests to use the lift. A minor problem but felt very rude to us and the other guests waiting to go to their room. Perhaps making staff use the stairs or a staff lift would be better. The room, 611, was dated; lots of dents and chips in the furniture, some very ugly paintings on the wall,  layers of dust along the skirting boards, dirt on the bathroom walls and chips out of the bath. Nothing like the room advertised online and the one we thought we had booked. I'm not one to complain usually but wanted to after spending 135 Euros on a room no better than a 2 star one. James at the front desk was really helpful and had no problem moving us into a more recently refurbished room on the 5th floor. The new room was great, tastefully decorated, clean and well cared for. If you are going to let guests stay in the old rooms please give them a choice of which type of room they would rather stay in and make a difference in price. It's plain lying to show only the most refurbished rooms online and give one option! The rest of our stay was great, nice room and helpful staff. Parking was free till 1pm on checkout and 3 euro per hour after that and plenty of spaces. There was a great choice at breakfast and the waiting staff were lovely, only down side was the music they played which sounded like hold music! All in all very good after the change of room and would happily stay again.",4,2014,08,07
248,Good location ,"I have stayed here a couple of times. It does need updating but it's a lovely hotel and very clean, with great location . How much time do you spend in your room when on a city break, and like I said it's clean. It's about 10/15 min walk into town which is a nice walk. The bar next door is nice and friendly and much cheaper on drinks than in Dublin. When I go back again to Dublin I ll use this hotel over and over again. Great value for money ",5,2014,08,06
248,needs updating,"the hotel location is really good  you can walk to st.stephens green and grafton street.....but the hotel itself leaves a lot to be desired. apart from the location i cant  recomment anything else. its clean , the rooms are clean ,   but if you are going there in the summer then there is no airconditioning,   not even in the  lobby, so you sweat and sweat,,, the heat in the bedroom in the night was unbareable so there,   the decor was so dated...even in the bedrooms.  the breakfast was not included in the price,,and that was 13 euro each extra  , so no points there,",2,2014,08,05
248,Great Location in Dublin,"Great location, staff very attentive and helpful, rooms nice and clean (albeit small). Buffet breakfast was extensive although some mof the food was a little dry (avoid the puddings as they were so dry as to be almost inedible). But you can walk a couple of blocks to a local breakfast place called Gerry's that was excellent and cheap. Short walk to St Stephen's Green, Trinity College, etc. Our room overlooked Camden Rd, so was a little noisy, and the pub next door (The Bleeding Horse) had a late-night crowd that liked to sing outside - but we were on vacation, so didn't really care...",4,2014,08,05
248,Good hotel near city centre,I stayed there for 2 nights at the end of July. I had been there before. Rooms are clean and spacious. Restaurant buffet is varied and good (10EUR per person if you book in advance) I recommend a back room since it is in quite a busy street and you might hear some noise. Tram station to city centre (Saint Stephen's Green) is just a few metres away from hotel entrance or you can go walking and it is about 10 mins.,4,2014,08,05
248,3 day Average Stay,"Locations was great for walking to most places, hotel was clean, garage parking was tight and only place our car was scratched in the 2 weeks in Ireland, 2 of front desk employees were never able to answer questions (ie:  Where is the bus stop?  How do you get to St Stephen's Green), noise level was still loud from the street (local residents, bars, gambling places, and (YES) street fist fighting), arrived at 8am and was told we couldn't leave our luggage - luckily had a rental car for storing our items, did not eat in any hotel restaurants, plenty of local eateries by hotel for great (and cheap) breakfasts & lunches, hotel provided a fan since our room was hot.",3,2014,08,03
248,Great location,"The Camden Court Hotel is located perfectly in Dublin. It was an easy walk wherever we needed to go. Most of the staff was accommodating, but I did encounter two very rude bartenders during our second night. I couldn't remember if they had my credit card on file, so I asked to pay for our glasses of wine outright instead of charging it to our room. They were not pleased (God knows why?) My husband even saw one roll his eyes as I was reaching for our credit card. I notified management, so hopefully they fix the problem. Other than that it was a nice place to stay.",4,2014,08,03
248,Great Service.,"Great Location close to St Stephens Green. Room, especially bathroom, was very clean, bed was comfortable although furnishings need updating. Fast and free WiFi big plus. Breakfast buffet included in rate was excellent for starting the day. All service personnel were friendly and helpful.",5,2014,08,03
248,Great Location,"Great location that is an easy walk to St. Stephen's Green.  I walked further to Trinity College and Temple Bar areas as well.
  
I opened my window to cool my room and was awakened due to late night brouhahas.  

Room was clean with free WIFI.",4,2014,08,01
248,Heart of Dublin,Basic room facilities although there is an indoor pool. Staff a little unfocussed at times. Food in bar area OK - servings a little small. Corridor noise carried thru into rooms - late night revelers particularly! Stayed over Easter Weekend = busy & noisy!,3,2014,07,30
248,Relief for aching feet!,"I have stayed at the camden court in the past and it is, as many others have mentioned, a clean and conveniently located hotel just to the south of St.Stephens Green and directly beside the Luas tram stop of Harcourts. This does, however, mean that I do a lot of walking in and around the city centre from the hotel and consequently often return with tired and aching feet! Well today I decided to treat myself to a swim in the pool and a pedicure at the hotels beauty salon and I am so glad I did. The staff are very friendly and the facilities are very good for a city hotel but the pedicure was the real treat, such a lovely therapist. I left with beautifully polished toes and feeling very relaxed. Happy to recommend a treatment to any other weary travellers!",5,2014,07,30
248,Gem in the Centre of Dublin,"Located in 5 minutes walk of St Stephens Green and same distance from Great Georges Street where you will find great bars. Hotel is also not far from clubs D2 & Coppers The hotel itself main factor is that while you stay with them you get free parking in their car park and €3 per hour from 1pm on day of check out.
The lobby is grand and airy. Staff are very welcoming. There is a bar and also a coffee doc available in lobby. 
Rooms are large and clean. Bathrooms have waterfall showers  and are very powerful. Cleaning is impecable.
Breakfast is available till 10:30am during the week and 11am weekends. Fresh fruit bowl and brown bread lovely. I am one for cold meats and cheese. I noticed that there was a different between friday and saturday morning breakfast. Meaning that fridays was much better standard and more choice of fresh cheeses not packed. Staff  very friendly and attentive. 
Only negatives: 
Scrambled eggs also had green mold on them
Woken by building work early on Friday morning - back room so be mindful",4,2014,07,29
248,Very enjoyable,"I recently stayed in this hotel with some friends.  The room was spacious and comfortable.  the hotel is situated a 10/15 minute walk away from the town centre, the river and temple bar, so it was a peaceful area and therefore we weren´t kept awake until the early hours with noise from the street.  The breakfast was amazing with everything you could possibly want for breakfast and much more, it is the first time that I have seen hot gammon on the breakfast buffet carved to order.  The fruit salad was especially delicious with lots of different fresh fruit.  I would highly recommend this hotel and would stay there again myself.  Thank you to the young man on reception who sorted out a problem we had with a rent a car company, he was so helpful and courteous and we are very grateful to him.  
Congratulations Camden Court!",5,2014,07,28
248,Convenient and clean,"Hotel is within walking distance of all tourist attractions and offers all amenities.  Rooms are comfortable and modern; however, quite warm in hot weather.  Some staff seem very inexperienced.  Location is on the border of seemingly less than desirable area.",3,2014,07,23
248,Nice hotel in downtown Dublin,Camden Court is a nice hotel in downtown Dublin. It is in a nice area that is a short walk to many local attractions. The service here is exceptional. The staff are eager to please customers and very willing to help. The hotel restaurant is very good and again the staff were so friendly and professional that I was impressed. Not a thing to complain about here however like many cities in Europe there is no air conditioning in the rooms.,4,2014,07,22
248,Worth the short walk to the centre...,Stayed here with my friend as we travelled up for a concert on St.Patricks weekend. We were stressed enough driving getting in to hotel. Not alot of spaces in the car park but thankfully we got one and headed inside. Really nice flow to this hotel and staff we friendly whilst very busy...in fact 2 coach loads of French tourist's arrived behind us as we were checking in..phew. Rooms very modern and thankfully had flat screen tv's..beds were big and comfortable and nice sized modern showers that were easy to work! When we came back that night we went to have one in the bar but didn't bother...layout of it was'nt great nothing special which was a pity compared to the cool decor all around the reception. Breakfast tge next morning was terrific...huge choice..a chief present to cook you omelette's and a beautiful lit fire enclosed in glass made you want to have that extra pastry and coffee. Again staff were very attentive and everything was very hot. We will stay here again for future gigs. Should have brought swimming shorts for wonderful pool....damn!,4,2014,07,22
248,Handly location,"I've stayed here before - and will again.  the location is very handy for the city centre.  Certainly there are cheaper hotels on the outskirts of Dublin but by the time you pay for taxi's or even public transport (and time) you will end up paying as much as this hotel costs.  Having said that - this was not a massively expensive hotel by Dublin city centre standards.

There is free outdoor or underground (secured) parking available.  This is a big plus as most hotels charge an arm and leg for parking.

The receptions area is large, bright and welcoming.  There was lots of activity there whenever I entered.   Check-in was fast and pleasant.  It appears that the elevators are undergoing some renovation at the moment so one small section of the reception area is under construction.  while most of the hotel is very nice, I did find the corridors to be very dated.  The room doors apparently used to have locks with keys but have been changed to use swipe cards.  but the doors are old and tatty.  There were vending machines on each floor.

My room was small.  Originally I was given a room with 2 single beds but was then moved to a room with a double bed.  There was free WiFi available everywhere (get the code from reception).  The room facilities were excellent  and the bathroom was clean.

I didn't have breakfast or use the leisure facilities so cannot comment on those.",4,2014,07,19
248,"Average hotel, great location.","Decent hotel, great location, within walking distance of pubs, restaurants, shopping, etc.  We stayed on two different occasions and our room was much bigger the second stay.  Not sure why, but the first room was small and noisy.  Since there is no air conditioner, opening the windows made it a bit cooler but much noisier.  The staff was OK, one was new to the area and could not give any recommendations. Not sure if we would stay there again, but wouldn't be disappointed if we did.",3,2014,07,14
248,Very Surprised,"Even though our room overlooked the main road, the noise was not too bad, the Standard Double room we booked in fact had 3 doubles, we could have held a dance party in the room it was so big. Very comfortable beds. A reasonable walk to all the tourist parts of town. Parking was good too.",4,2014,07,10
248,Great spot!,"Stayed here in our one and only night in Dublin! Super location and a wonderful older hotel. Breakfast was outstanding in the restaurant. Front desk staff very helpful!

We were within walking of great shopping and tourist shops. I would stay here again if I return to Dublin!",4,2014,07,09
248,VERY VERY SAD AND DISSAPOINTED !!!,"if you would check with the duty manager who was working on sunday morning called David , he will explain. we stayed in room 615 however someone decided to have a party from 4am until 6am , my wife was verbally abused when we asked them to keeo quiet , security was called several times , NO SLEEP FROM 4AM UNTIL 8AM SO CHECKED OUT AROUND 9AM 

S",1,2014,07,08
248,Nice Family Room,"We found this hotel to be nice for our family of 4.  The family room was not exactly what we expected based on website photo but bigger than anticipated.  Double bed and two twins beds was great!  Able to get a fan when weather proved warmer than normal.  Appreciated windows opened wide at night to allow breeze in too.

The included breakfast was good - hot traditional Irish breakfast fare plus fresh fruit, toast, yogurt, cereal, juice, tea and coffee.  

Fitness center and pool are nice amenities too.  And the Green Hop and Off bus does a morning pick up at 9:50 am each day at least in summer that shuttles you the main route.  We did not find the location to super central but things were walkable or easy via bus.

Overall good experience!",4,2014,07,05
248,One night stay in Dubline,"This is a 3 star hotel.  Lobby, restaurants and common areas are very nice.  We booked a family room which was quite large but very dated.  (Bathroom was newer though). Hotel is within walking distance of city center and all and all a good value for the price we paid. Parking was included which is helpful. We were fortunate enough to have great warm sunny weather for 95% of our Ireland trip, but the downside of this is most hotels do not have AC, the windows only opened about 1 inch but a fan was already in the room.",3,2014,07,04
248,Great location.,We recently visited Ireland and because we were planning on being in Dublin at three different times on this trip we decided to work out of the same hotel.  And we wanted a swimming pool.  Camden Court Hotel is both well located in Dublin and it has a well kept pool. The hotel is easy walking distance to the centre of town and all the main attractions. The front desk was very helpful in finding us a quiet room( on the 6th floor) and the rooms were well kept by the superb cleaning staff.  The breakfast was very good and served in a spacious dining room.  There was a great pub in the hotel with an excellent chef.  I would choose this hotel again when returning to Dublin.  It ticked all of my boxes.,4,2014,07,01
248,"Good location, great service!","The hotel is in a great spot for sightseeing around Dublin; pretty much everything is within walking distance.  Front desk staff was very helpful, especially David.  The room was nice, though a bit worn in some areas.  We were on the top floor.  Parking is below the hotel, so that was nice.  We ate breakfast at the hotel and it was good.",4,2014,06,29
248,Excellent Service,"I am very difficult to please and always want to get the value of any hotel I stay at. However, at the Camden Court Hotel one gets a lot more value and service than the cost of the room. My husband stays there regularly and we organised a surprise 40th birthday for him at the hotel. Sandra in the Meeting Excellence Department was so professional and helpful and was amazing organising the food and accommodation. My husband stayed at the hotel on Thursday night (the party was on Friday) and nobody left the secret slip. There was a section cordoned off for us and everything went perfectly. The food was fab (everybody raved about the chicken) and the bar service was great. 
Every time I stay at the Camden Court I feel I should write a positive review but never get around to it but this stay was a dream for us.
Even though there are loads of nightclubs and late bars around I have never been woken up by noise from the street.
As a very difficult to please person it's probably the only hotel I have stayed at that I have never had a complaint or issue about and would recommend it above any hotel in Dublin.",5,2014,06,28
248,Horribly experience...,"Let me start by saying two things...   We have been travelling Ireland for almost three weeks now and had amazing accommodations along the way.  Secondly, I am a travel consultant and this hotel was recommended to me.  

After being lost in the city for two hours, we finally found the hotel...  No where to park as the entry  full of buses.  The doorman yelled at me for ten minutes while my friend ran in and registered...  Then we had a car full of baggage and were offered no assistance whatsoever...   This hotel caters to groups, so expect nothing if you are travelling individually.

The room is extremely hot and small...   Typical Europe size...  We admit to having a bit of luggage after three weeks of sightseeing and shopping... In order to walk from the bed to the bathroom, we have close our suitcases and out them against the wall.... Then...  Because it was so hot, we had to leave a window open.  No sleep due to the street noise...   We are in room 203 right over the Main Street,,,   Pub noise on and cars at night and the street noise does not slow down much.  Oh... and the open window never really cooled the room down...   Not to mention doors banging up and down the hall.......

So far this hotel has been a horrible experience and I would not recommend it to anyone.  There are better value to be had elsewhere...   There is definitely better service elsewhere,...

can't wait to try the breakfast....  Maybe I can catch a nap there????",1,2014,06,28
248,They could put more effort into decorating the rooms,"Great location. Parking.  No breakfast but a fabulous pool, sauna, steam room.  A very nice, modern lobby and bar but why don't they put a little more effort into decorating the rooms?  Ours was cramped, with standard, cheap, and chipped, motel furnishings and a stained brown carpet .  Without changing the size, replace the carpet,  alter the lighting, the drapes, put up some nice pictures:  it could be so much more pleasant (and perhaps bring in more money).  And whose idea was it to put a 1 1/2 inch high door stop directly in front of the toilet?  I've tripped on it at least four times.  The advertised ""four star"" it's not.  Who decides on and gives out these ""stars"" anyway?",3,2014,06,27
248,Fantastic friendly hotel,"Stayed here Monday and Tuesday night.  The rooms had recently been updated and were very comfortable, lovely comfy beds.  Everything nice and clean.  Dave (I think the assistant manager) was great, nothing was too much trouble and the maids were also very helpful, in fact everyone was.  The breakfast is very nice but a typical ""hotel"" breakfast and atmosphere, may be better to walk into town and get breakfast elsewhere - see my review of K C Peaches. I would def recommend and I would stay here again.",5,2014,06,26
248,Great Central Dublin hotel with free off-road parking.,"Booked in for two nights arriving from Dublin Port by car. Nice welcome from Magda. We were allocated a room which was street side. It was hot with no air-con. It was no trouble for Magda to provide an alternative room nearer the back away from the sun. There was still no air-conditioning however because the room was away from the sun it was cool and we could leave the window open overnight without it being noisy (Room Tip!). The room has usual comforts like tea-making facilty, iron etc. although I would have liked a room-safe to keep passports, jewellery etc.  The bed was very comfortable.The lifts work well and promptly. Magda was able to recommend local alternative restaurants, advice on the area etc.
The free off-road parking was a great bonus. There is a great pub directly next-door.
I will definitely stay here again.",5,2014,06,25
248,Convenient and competitive,"Located 10 mins walk south of St Stephen's Green, which in turn is a short distance from the Grafton St shopping area , Trinity etc.. Modern decor. I didn't experience any problems with heat, ""tired rooms""  or poor wifi connectivity mentioned by some reviewers - my room on 3rd floor was very good in all respects. The staff were extremely friendly, attentive and knowledgeable. Breakfast good, but cannot comment on evening meals. Had booked as the spa/fitness room looked a bonus, but I was too busy to use it :-(",4,2014,06,23
248,Unfortunate choice,"There wasn't anything awful about this tired hotel other than the heat wave and lack of air con (they did bring me a fan which helped a tiny bit) but overall it was just not that nice. The bed was pretty uncomfortable, the wifi disconnected literally 10 or more times, the plumbing in the sink sprayed everywhere, and the decor was dismal. However, the staff were quite nice and breakfast was decent. I will not return, but it wasn't so bad that I had to move hotels after the first night. ",3,2014,06,21
248,Decent hotel,"Stayed for one night midweek as location great for National Concert Hall.Room/bathroom better than I expected.
Bar and restaurant looks fine but let down by very poor bar food.I found the burger/chips almost inedible. It wasn't cheap either so I was very disappointed by that as I normally find bar food excellent in Dublin. Must say the breakfast was faultless and service excellent. I would stay here again but eat out.Had to keep windows open as so hot but very noisey. Didn't have time to try leisure facilities.",3,2014,06,19
248,great location with parking city centre,"Stayed here June bank holiday weekend, clean hotel bed rooms,you need to open your windows straight away as it gets really hot at night ( you have been warned) , free and plentiful parking. I have eaten lunch here before which was good but did not eat there this weekend. good WiFi just ask at reception for password. just 5 mins from st Stephens Green. all in all a good place to stay if visiting Dublin city.",4,2014,06,19
248,Exceeded expectations,"Pleanty of FREE parking. Lovely spacious foyer. Great bar with a lovely food menu plus very helpful and friendly staff. Comfortable king size beds. Good quality breakfast. On check in, WiFi password printed on key receipt. Really lovely touch",5,2014,06,17
248,Great hotel but rooms too hot,"Our 2nd visit to the Camden Court hotel, we were put up on the 6th floor.  As soon as you enter the corridors you are hit with heat, we were lucky to have a warm weekend in May but all of the radiators were blaring in the corridors making our room extremely hot and hard to sleep.

That said we highlighted this to the team and they gave us a fan which did help, as even with the windows open it was way too hot.  Everything else about the hotel is great, a short walk into the main town, close to Luas stops and great bars and restaurants.

The hotel bar is lovely and welcoming, nice just sitting in the grand foyer having a coffee watching the world go by.  Rooms are spotless housekeeping staff do a great job and don't wake you up to early! look forward to staying again.",4,2014,06,16
248,Dreary place,"Sadly disappointed by this establishment.  Its location is a bit out of the way from the city centre.
It just looked terribly out of date, not in a good chic way, but in a 'it should be renovated' sort of way.  Dreary is the best word I could find for the place.
Room had all the basic needs, but bed not great.  Room dull.
Breakfast was a bit of a shambles, over crowded, and needed to really have to think - where on earth do i get x,y,z. A poor experience.

Fire escape - I always check out locations when I stay.  What I thought was the closest one (looking from my room door) was actually 50 paces away.  There was one closer (less than 20).  The corridor was quite narrow en route to the longer of the two - would not like to be going along that in an emergency with people pouring out of their rooms.  It probably complies ok, but it just felt narrow?

If you do stay and you enjoy Middle Eastern cuisine, try the Damascus Gate restaurant across Camden road",2,2014,06,15
248,Good stay at Camden Court,"Lovely hotel, only had one night but was very comfortable.  Comfortable beds and room was spotless.  Breakfast was very good with plenty of variety  Staff were efficient but not over friendly.  It was a bit out of the way of the main city area.  Overall we loved the rooms and had a good nights sleep.",4,2014,06,11
248,Great hotel,"Great modern room & had a great stay. Walked into Dublin centre which was a little bit long but well manageable. Room price was a bit higher than I would like, but it was Saturday night and it seems anywhere in Dublin is dearer then. The bit higher rate was offset by having such a great room.
Overall highly recommend.",5,2014,06,09
248,Nice and a good Value!,"This charming hotel is centrally located, and I felt that the owners really want guests to have a great experience.   There is a very nice gym, a great little restaurant, and competent staff.   Our room was clean and there was coffee and tea.  I feel that it is the little things that matter when choosing a place to stay.   My friend was trying to connect with me, and had called the hotel staff, who went to the trouble of typing a personal note and placing it under my door to let me know.   The hotel epitomizes the generous Irish spirit, and  I will definitely return,",5,2014,06,07
248,Fabulous! ,"Stayed for one night on June 3rd with my mother, sister and three year old niece. Prior to booking I was in touch by both email and phone to query parking, use of the leisure facilities for my niece etc. I couldn't believe how prompt the replies were. Everyone we dealt with from start to finish was so friendly and helpful. 

On arrival we had dinner in the hotel bar and the man working there was lovely. Very smiley and friendly and made a little chat with my niece. The food was reasonably priced and delicious. We ordered more! I also saw a second restaurant and a coffee bar which looked lovely though we didn't eat at either. 

My sister took my niece swimming in the pool and said it was fabulous. 

We booked a family room and it had two double and one single bed. It was spacious and bright and perfect for our stay. The location was so central, especially with children and the parking was free and close. (I was recently caught with expensive parking at a different hotel which had said it was nearby and was a good 10min walk!)

All in all I think for the price you pay you get a fabulous room, great service, choice of restaurant and central location with free parking. I look forward to a return visit in the near future!  ",5,2014,06,07
248,Very good Hotel!,"It was my second time that I stayed at this hotel, and both times I had very good night sleep at a great big bed, a clean bathroom and the services as dinner, breakfast all with very good quality of food!
I enjoyed a lot to stay at the Camden Court Hotel!!",5,2014,06,07
248,Fantastic value for money,"This hotel is central to everything you would need for a weekend city break or a family trip to Dublin.It is a 6-8 minute comfortable walk to Grafton Street with some lovely restaurants and bars nearby. The staff are very helpful and nothing is too much bother. This is my 2nd stay and the hotel, both times for the Flora Mini Marathon but I will definitely return again on a shopping relaxing break as I have yet to use the Spa or the pool/gym facilities.",5,2014,06,03
248,Nice hotel and good location,"THis is a nice hotel at a reasonable rate and the bar food is good- maybe a bit pricey but good. 
Only negative is when I went down for breakfast they claimed it wasn't included in the booking (through booking.com) so I had to return to my room to bring down my booking form and prove it. NOT impressed with this because when I checked in the same lady confirmed that breakfast was included!!
Apart from that I'd recommend this hotel and WILL return.",4,2014,06,03
248,lovely hotel,"My 1st time staying at this Hotel. Staff were very helpful & pleasant. Our room was very spacious & had tea & coffee making facilities, ironing board & all bathroom requirements. Lots of restaurants close by also lots of nice pubs. The Luas line is also very near so its so easy to get into the city or the many attractions nearby.There is a beautiful Leisure center in the Hotel also. We had dinner in the restaurant & it was excellent with great staff. I would recommend this Hotel & would definitely go back to stay there.",5,2014,06,02
248,Fabulous Place to Stay,"The Camden Court is centrally located and close to the tram line and Grafton St. Due to my error was there a day earlier than scheduled for a tour. They had a room available at reasonable price. Staff and food was great. They had fans available for when the room was to warm and brought to the room quickly. Had trouble connecting to the internet, but help came to our room quickly and resolved the problem. Stayed the first week in May. Would stay here again if I get the chance to return to Dublin, Ireland.

Despite what other reviews have reported this location is not out dated and is a fabulous place to stay.",5,2014,06,01
248,"Great Location, Nice Rooms, but Staff Only Okay","We couldn't have asked for a better location to from which to explore Dublin. Most of the attractions are within walking distance and there are a number of excellent restaurants and bars nearby. The rooms were reasonably sized, fairly well-decorated and clean, and because we were facing the parking lot, it was fairly quiet at night. There is no air conditioning, and although the windows opened, it became a bit muggy and uncomfortably warm in the room, especially after taking showers. Though the staff was friendly enough, they didn't exhibit the same level of customer service we experienced elsewhere in Dublin. For instance, after waiting a while for someone to notice us at the desk trying to check out, a staff member opted to answer the phone rather than prioritize the guests standing in front of him. And instead of being able to provide a forgotten toothbrush, despite what it says in the hotel guide, I was sent down the road to buy one. These are admittedly very small things that would not prevent me from staying there again, but they are small things that are easy to fix and would help make guests feel more welcome.",4,2014,06,01
248,A great spot for doing business,"Although I haven't as yet stayed overnight, I use this hotel regularly as a training venue and the  level of service in the business centre is excellent. While Sandra and Orla are great, and nothing is a problem for them, I particularly want to mention a member of staff called Marcin.  He is so friendly and efficient as regards servicing of the room and seems to appear, as if by magic, to sort things out whenever I have a 'laptop malfunction'!! 
I've had a couple of 'working' breakfasts and lunches here and they were fine but I'm looking forward to an opportunity to discover more of what this hotel has to offer.",5,2014,05,30
248,Family Friendly,"This weekend we visited Dublin and stayed in Camden Court.  The excellent customer service started out upon making the reservation.  Although, we made a reservation for a twin room with an extra bed, we were offered a family room of same price which gave us the extra room needed.  However, upon checkin, we were kind of shewed away.  I shook it off and just took it as a hard day.  However, from that day forward, they were all excellent!  Well some more than others.  They went out of their way to make us all comfortable.  When traveling with small children, this makes all the difference.  

We had one family room and one double room.  Both rooms were clean and very comfortable.  The beds and rooms were roomy and comfortable.  The bathrooms were bigger than normal and provided all the extras.  My children loved the pool and I loved the jacuzzi and steam room.  Something for the whole family.  The hotel is close to central centre.  It is approximately a 15 minute walk when traveling with children.  There is several supermarkets and restaurants within a 5 minute walk and a few bakeries.  Free parking was great!  Just don't forget to get your ticket validated.

All in all, I would definitely recommend this hotel for a family.  The customer service made all the difference for me and my family.  I would definitely stay here again if in the area.",4,2014,05,28
248,A good hotel,"My wife & I spent a three-day trip to Dublin at The Camden Court. We'd pre-arranged a refurbished room, which had been decorated very pleasantly to a good standard. There were a couple of items that needed attention in the bathroom: the handrail on the wall beside the bath was a bit rickety and the tap on the handbasin was coming loose. It wasn't a problem and, to be fair, they're not going to know unless they're told, which we did on leaving. The room was clean and well tended by the service staff. The hotel itself we found to be generally well placed and, although Temple Bar is about 20 minutes walk away, this isn't really an issue unless you plan to spend all your time there, in which case you should perhaps make plans to stay at a hotel closer to that area. We didn't eat in the restaurant, so can't comment in that regard. Only two complaints - and they are relatively minor - firstly, our room was overlooking the hotel entrance plaza which houses some pretty big air-conditioning units. They are audible at times when one might prefer an early night or a lie-in and we did have to keep the windows closed at night. The other was the depth - or shallowness - of the bath! After a hike around a town I do like to come back to a nice relaxing bath and I found ours to be rather a let down in that respect. It was extremely shallow to the point that, even when the water was up to the level of the outlet, there was only enough depth to get your bum wet! I actually measured it and there can't have been more than about 8 inches of water in there by the time the bath was as full as it could be. It was probably the shallowest bath I've ever experienced and I can't work out why it was installed, unless The Camden is trying to save on water! Probably not an issue as far as most people are concerned, though, and we'd recommend this hotel to anyone on a visit here.",4,2014,05,28
248,A gem of a hotel,"Tucked away in an otherwise uninspiring  area of the city this hotel is superb.
Good WiFi access, excellent pool, sauna, steam room gym etc. Rooms a decent size, clean and tidy. Good breakfast.
There is an abundance of good restaurants and cafés within easy walking distance, to suit all tastes. There are many parks in the immediate area..",5,2014,05,28
248,Louise and zoe,"My best friend and I, visited the camden court hotel for my birthday. It was amazing, the staff were ok, some where offish and rude. But others like the twin men at the bar couldn't do enough for you. I remember one of their names which was Gary.  We said we would for sure revisit the camden again. Rooms were lovely. Nothing to complain about apart from....The food is a bit expensive in the hotel and not much choice. But we tried it and enjoyed it. Everybody in dublin are really friendly and like to help. Also try the gravedigger bus tour. Was really funny the guys just have you in stitches. ",5,2014,05,27
248,Good price but long walk to temple bar,The rooms are ok. They are clean but whoever they had do the refurbishment must have been cheap as is visible in certain areas. The location is a decent walk into temple bar through a rougher looking neighborhood. The free parking is a big plus as well as the more than helpful staff. The prices for coffee are a bit high so find a cafe down the street. Overall an ok place to stay just wish it was closer to temple bar. ,3,2014,05,25
248,Excellent!!,"Booked this as a last minute decision and didn't really expect a lot but was pleasantly surprised! The staff were really friendly and helpful, will definitely stay here again if we ever visit Dublin. The rooms were really nice and the bed was one of the comfiest I've stayed in.",5,2014,05,25
248,Definitely Cone back there!,"Stayed here two nights, was a bit expensive but put that down to hotel prices going up for concerts on in city. The location was amazing so worth it and minutes walk from Stephens Green. Pubs & luas outside hotel. Staff were lovely, night porter or whoever answered the door to us one night wasn't the friendliest but maybe that was because we came back really late. Food was great and pool was lovely too!!definitely recommending it.   ",5,2014,05,25
248,"Great location, service, breakfast and value in Dublin","Delightful stay, delicious breakfast and Magda's rec of the Whitefriar Grill for an anniversary dinner made it all even better. Room was large and clean and although modest in furnishings, very comfortable. ",4,2014,05,25
248,Great breakfast and nice room,"Really liked this hotel and thought it was god value for Dublin. The cooked breakfast was delicious and we had a nice room. Locations not bad: 15 mins walk to Temple Bar, 10 mins to Grafton st and it's near a tram stop. The corridors are in need of a redecoration though. ",4,2014,05,24
248,"Great hotel, but a bit dated...","Only stayed here for 2 nights, but the room we were given was comfortable and spacious (It had one double and two single beds in it, even though it was just myself and my mom).  The room was clean, and neat, with all the normal amenities you would expect in a good quality hotel, its just that everything seemed quite old. You can see the pictures, but all the furniture looked like it was from the 1970s and the walls were definitely in need a coat of paint as there were many nicks, scratches and places where the paint was simply chipping off. The lobby on the other hand is modern and beautifully decorated while the room was just functional and definitely bland. The bathroom was pretty good though, and seemed to have been recently remodeled.  

I found the lobby and the bathroom to be a strange contrast with the look and feel of the room itself, but as I said it was a good hotel: the staff were friendly and helpful, the restaurant was good and not too expensive and it was very quite. The hotel is also in a great location in the Dublin city with easy access to all the major landmarks around the city, whether that be by walking or by public bus.",4,2014,05,22
248,Good Hotel for the price,"Only stayed the one night.
Room was very good and modern (are all rooms refurbished now?)
Arrived too late for the restaurant (last order 9.45, NOT 10 pm as advised in error by reception...) however decent if unspectacular steak served in the bar.
Service was good and the staff are uniformly pleasant and polite. The pool and sauna are pretty good, breakfast same.
Only let-down was the weak and intermittent wifi which was a pain as I had planned to do some work and was forced to wander out to tour a few pubs instead - shame on you Hotel ;)",4,2014,05,21
248,Expected much better,"The hotel location is convenient to all local amenities and offers free wifi. The hotel staff were friendly. The hotel itself I think needs to be modernized. It's conference facilities were not the greatest. Rooms were okay, carpets need upgrading and nothing to brag about. Found that the TV remote needed cleaning, it seemed greasy. Towels not replaced when requested from my experience. Very unlikely to ever consider this place again or recommend their establishment. ",2,2014,05,20
248,Great 2 night Stay,"I don't know the rates because it was included in a package I had gotten.  But it was a very nice hotel, our room was spacious and clean.  The front desk was able to help me several times and never seemed annoyed at my questions.  We dined in the first night and it was a lovely meal and nice wine list, the full breakfast was really good, love the Irish bread.  We had tea in the lobby both days, and the wait staff was extremely nice.  My only negative, the drapes in the lobby are a little torn and frayed but that was it.  Since it was rainy weather I did make use of the exercise room as well.  I will note if you need a place for business meeting or conference this looked like the place to be!",4,2014,05,20
248,You Get What You Pay For,"When the price of a hotel room in a tourist city is too good to be true-it usually is. This hotel advertises rates of 89.00 euros a night, renovated rooms, fine food etc. 

The rooms are not renovated, this is unfortunately a poor touristy hotel. The staff at the desk are helpful enough however, the staff in the restaurant for breakfast seem simply miserable. I admit, I'm getting use to Irish food but the coffee here is the worst I've tasted. 

They also advertise ""free wifi"". at 8:30am I could not get online so I rang the front desk. I was told ""there are too many people online, no it won't help if you come to the lobby, you can try after 9am."" So, they really don't have accessible wifi.

Not enough towels-seems they run out of them and a 2 person room, a double room-just know-could be 2 twin beds. The walls are thin so if someone above you moves chairs around, yes it wakes you up. 

I found the bar staff friendly enough and the price of a glass of wine reasonable, 6.15 euro. 

As I am working while I am here, it' causes me problems because of the wifi and I don't feel any personal service.",3,2014,05,19
248,Lovely hotel,Very nice hotel with lovely pool and facilities. Staff friendly and helpful. We were given a room with double bed when we requested a twin. We were moved within 5 minuted but the room wasn't as nice as the first one. It was clean and comfortable though which is all that matters. ,4,2014,05,17
248,Comfy and convenient,Our Christmas staff night out went to Dublin in December 2013 and we stayed in this hotel. It's perfectly situated for restaurants and nightlife in the city centre and a stones throw from the Luas stop to take you out to Dundrum for shopping. A WIN/WIN location. I've stayed here before and am already booked to return later in the year. ,5,2014,05,15
248,Not what I booked!,"Having booked a double room, I was given a twin room. Checking with the receptionist the answer was to push two beds together (which obviously drift apart). They said all the rooms are the same, the doubles are just two beds shoved together - but that doesn't explain the plug sockets etc in the middle of the headboard. Service was pretty dreadful having waited 15 minutes to check in while a customer made some queries about their bill. 
 Wouldn't recommend.  Wouldn't stay here again. ",2,2014,05,13
248,Well located with friendly personnel,"Excellent location in a lively street. The hotel is about 15 minutes walking distance from the centre or alternatively there are many bus lines. Personnel was very friendly and helped us with tips and print out of bus schedules.

Breakfast seemed rather expensive so we took in bars  and restaurants in the Dublin Street.

As in many hotels drinks were clearly more expensive so we went to bars or restaurants for a coffee or night cap.",4,2014,05,13
248,"Clean, central location in Dublin","The location is great if you want to be central to everything. Rooms are clean. The room I stayed in was very noisy starting at 5:30am with what sounded like construction although I didn't see any construction going on.
The hotel is over priced for what you get, but it is central to everything! Breakfast is average.  I won't say I'd never stay again, but I would certainly try another hotel before booking here again.",2,2014,05,13
248,Always consistently good...,"Stayed here for the third or fourth time over Easter. Great relaxed atmosphere. Very friendly helpful staff. Breakfast is very good with some good choices and great to have fresh fruit on offer. Rooms are comfortable & very clean, if a little dated. Location is great, only a short walk from St Stephens Green and lots of public transport close by-buses and the Luas  only a few minutes away.

Only slight downside is that they lock the doors quite early on at night and if you come back late (as you do in a city where people don't go out until late!) you have to enter through the side entrance and attract the attention of the night staff to let you in.",4,2014,05,11
248,Nice hotel and friendly staff,"Stayed here at the end of March. Comfortable room but in need of redecoration, certainly didn't look like the photos on the website. So a bit deceiving.

Had a nice breakfast each morning, however, found the mini blocks of cheese a bit odd when other hotels serve sliced cheese.",3,2014,05,06
248,Nice Hotel,"May the 1st.Dublin city hotels was very busy on Thursday night I scrambled to get a room, I left it late. This was my first time staying here. Car parking can be a bit confusing so be aware. A very nice hotel well laid out, a good big reception area with plenty of seating, a nice bar and a good size restaurant with good food and very nice staff.
Plenty of bars and night clubs in this area of the city. Hence can be a bit noisy with guest come back late. Over all a nice hotel that I would stay in again.

248,Dublin the second time,"First stayed at Camden Court six years ago, did wonder if we should go to the same hotel a second time, but glad we did.

Good rooms, staff polite and friendly and a free pool of reasonable size.

Restaraunt, good service and reasonably priced.

Whilst they do serve Guiness at the Hotel, also do try Cassidys a few doors down.

Richard from Glastonbury, Somerset.",5,2014,05,02
248,perfect,"Is is really close to everything you need. To great bars, and to the temple bar. walking distance.

Also the room is really comfortable, the bed and bathroom.

The heater worked fine, the TV is nice. The food at the breakfast is GREAT.

I was with the flu and they made me hot lemonade with honey and cinammon (i guess it was cinammon).

Perfect service",5,2014,04,28
248,Very pleasant stay,"I stayed at Camden Court over the Easter holiday weekend and had a very pleasant stay. 

Lovely, bright room (room 523) large bathroom with a fantastic shower and good quality shampoos and soaps.  No safe in the room but I was able to leave my passport in the hotel safe at reception. 

The staff were warm and welcoming and the breakfasts were great. Lots of fresh fruit and traditional bacon etc.  

The location is ~ a five minute walk from the Air Coach drop off on Lower Leeson Street. 

The on site gym is very handy. Did not try the pool but the treadmills were good. 

Will stay again. ",5,2014,04,28
248,"Great location, great service, great food","I have now stayed in the Camden Court hotel on numerous on business. This is a great hotel, reasonably priced in a Central Dublin location. Excellent facilities, safe parking, comprehensive breakfast buffet, friendly well trained staff, the only less than positive comment I would make is that some of the rooms are a bit tired, worn and in need of a facelift.
In general a very comfortable stay.",5,2014,04,27
248,Perfect,"This is a fabulous hotel. Our bedroom was excellent - huge bed, lovely shower, plenty of storage space, good wifi, iron, and everything else you need. The restaurant was lovely, and the breakfast superb. We had room service and it was very quick, and very tasty. The swimming pool (with children's pool), sauna, steam room, gym -  all great. Actually, one of the best hotel swimming pools we have ever seen. The hotel is located just 15 minutes walk (or 4 bus stops) from the very centre of Dublin. Finally, I must mention the staff. We have rarely come across such friendly, helpful and cheerful staff anywhere. Our 3 night stay was just fantastic, thanks to staying in a perfect hotel.",5,2014,04,27
248,Stag Do with friends ,"A mature chilled(ish) weekend with some friends, great hotel with a nice bar, great breakfast and an awesome steak in the restaurant. Rooms were excellent. I was very pleasantly surprised for the price. Would definitely return. Slightly out of the main areas but some nice pubs near by. ",5,2014,04,23
248,"Great location, good fun and comfortable rooms","A very nice hotel in a great location, just outside Dublin city centre.  Easy to find, with adequate parking.

Friendly welcome on check in, and efficient service.  The room was nice and spacious, with a good size bathroom.

Good food; room service was prompt and the room service menu had a decent selection of options.  The buffet breakfast had a huge range of options and seemed to cater for all.  The cooked stuff was excellent.

The only minor downside I experienced was that my room faced a road that was very busy at all times of the day and night, but that's the price you pay for such a location.  Overall, a great experience and I will certainly be back.",5,2014,04,23
248,Laid-Back,"Hotel needs a larger sign and a more impressive entrance you could easily walk past it, The hotel is a good 3 star with a roomy reception area laid-back bar and an upmarket restaurant it also has a gym and a swimming pool, sauna and steam room, all well designed and well kept.
The room was clean and well soundproofed, the only slight niggle for me was, the staff at  breakfast could have been more helpful and customer friendly.
There is a good pub next door and the bus service to Dublin centre is across the road,( 5mins) it is also possible to catch a bus to the Airport.
I would go back and would recommend.",4,2014,04,23
248,Mum's weekend away,"Hi all,
We stayed at the Camden Court Hotel,  We had two rooms between three of us mum's.   It was easy to get to from the airport by taxi (taxis are expensive in Dublin) and was far enough out of the Temple Bar area that we weren't bothered by the late night revelling except when we wanted to take part!
It has a lovely pool, sauna and Jacuzzi and the rooms, though basic and not huge, were perfect for our needs and they were clean!  
Staff were friendly enough.  Great bar on site which was excellent for us and we certainly enjoyed some of the cocktails (Long Island Iced Teas in particular!).  Be warned....the Dublin measures are slighty larger than UK measures.....lol.    
In terms of location, it was great.  We were just a few minutes from St Stephens Green - shopping, restaurants, bars and other hotel bars that you could also visit.   Some gorgeous places to visit which was fantastic.   Temple Bar bars in the centre of Dublin cost a fortune so although they were worth a visit........better to stick to just outside the centre....its cheaper.  It cost around 30 euros for 3 standard drinks (ie Bacardi & coke, etc).
We thought it was reasonably priced for Camden Court as well so it was a bonus to see how lovely it was....and there was a tram two minutes away which took you down to St Stephens Green if you didn't feel like walking.
All in all, well done Camden Court........we would visit again for definite.  Thank you.",5,2014,04,22
248,Lovely hotel- amazing weekend!!,"Beautiful hotel with an even more beautiful Irish Breakfast! I would go as far as saying it was one of the best breakfasts I ever had. 
Hotel was clean and room was lovely. Really thought the décor was lovely!
Hotel was used as a base but a lovely one at that!
Dublin city centre was amazing and we had a thoroughly enjoyable weekend! So much so I returned with friends a couple of months later. Will also be returning again this year! 
Only slight complaint was it was a taxi ride away from city centre as took a while to walk (around 20 minutes)",5,2014,04,22
248,Okay for a Business Overnight but ...,"My wife and I actually live in Dublin and work nearby but we moved in for a few days while getting repairs done at home. The reception is like any business hotel but the rooms are a little more cramped and worn than you might expect; it's like ""Hilton"" downstairs but ""Comfort Inn"" upstairs. They badly need to spend some money revamping their carpets, furniture and bathrooms. We didn't try the breakfasts or dinners so couldn't comment on either. Would likely be fine for a one night business trip but not much else.",3,2014,04,20
248,Almost but not quite ...,"5 stars. The hotel is in a great location, has an excellent pool and gym, good, friendly staff and the food is of a good standard. The only drawback is, going by our own experience of family room 509, the rooms are in need of an update as ours suffered from an intermittently very noisy radiator, 3 non-functioning electrical sockets and stained carpet.",4,2014,04,17
248,great value,"This is my second time staying at Camden court and I look forward to returning.
Clean modern room with big and VERY comfortable bed. Great facilities and great staff. 
When our party returned to the hotel after attending a wedding the barman was happy to serve us until after 5am SWEEEET 😁",5,2014,04,14
248,Excellent,"Have just returned from a 2 night break in Dublin. This was my second stay at the Camden court hotel and have to say the standards have not dropped. The hotel is spotless, the staff very friendly and helpful and my room was great, with probably the most comfortable bed I have slept on in any hotel. We had the buffet breakfast, which was nice, and you could have as much as you like. The location is ideal, as its only a 10-15 minute walk to the shopping areas and busy pubs / restaurants.will definitely return on my next visit to Dublin.",5,2014,04,06
248,Loved this hotel!,"Stayed here for 3 days with my hubby and 2 teenage daughters. Had two rooms. Both were roomy, attractive, clean and comfortable. Hotel staff were very helpful and cheerful. Irish breakfast was amazing. Would have gained 10 lbs if had stayed any longer. Within walking distance to many if not most sights of interest. Would highly recommend this hotel and would stay again in a minute!",5,2014,04,04
248,Very welcoming for Families,"It is 3 years since I wrote a review on Trip Advisor despite the fact that we often stay away but felt I needed to leave a 5 star review for this excellent hotel and especially for the staff.

We stayed mid week with our 3 year old and despite most of the clients being there on business we were made to feel very welcome.

Nothing was too much trouble and the friendly and helpful attitudes of staff stood out over and above anywhere else we have stayed in the past few years. It made what could have been a very stressful trip (we had business to attend to in the city) into a family holiday.

I see that the hotel has a 3 star rating however it feels much more like a 4 star. The room was on the small side but as expected for a city centre and more than made up for by the location.

The photos of the pool on the website don't do it justice. There is a shallower children's pool adjoining the main pool so it works perfectly for swimmers and non swimmers.

Special thanks to the gentleman who was on duty in the restaurant last night. His attention to our every need and his understanding allowed us to enjoy the delicious set menu in a relaxed manner despite the fact that our little one was on the verge of a meltdown after being dragged around the city all day. 

To the Management, please praise your staff - their attitude to their work cannot be faulted.",5,2014,04,03
248,Well located hotel,"My husband and I stayed last night at the Camden Court Hotel as we were dining nearby in the superb Sabor Brazil (separately reviewed) and, knowing that our meal was likely to end late and involve alcohol, we didn't want to have far to go afterwards.  I knew very little about this hotel when booking it apart from its location and was very surprised immediately at its size.  It is much bigger than I had anticipated.  
Our room was clearly a family room with 3 beds - 2 doubles and a single.  It was simply huge.  The beds were very comfortable.  I had checked in a few hours before we were due to go to dinner and had a nice afternoon nap.
We both slept well.  I didn't partake of breakfast but my husband did and said it was fantastic - at €10 a head that is very good value for money.  We will definitely return.",4,2014,04,03
248,Great Hotel,"Excellent location.  A few short blocks from the very center of everything but easy walk to St. Stephens Greens and the hop on/hop off bus stop. Short walk to St. Stephens Greens, Grafton Street, Nassau Street, Trinity College and much more.  Lovely hotel.  Friendly, helpful, accommodating staff.  It was nice to be a little bit from the very center as it was quieter, especially being there St. Patrick's weekend.  Would definitely stay again.",5,2014,03,29
248,Perfect!,"I've been to Dublin 4 times and this is by far the best hotel I've stayed in, in Dublin! Staff were very friendly, informative and helpful. The area of the Camden Court hotel was perfect! There were lots of shops, pubs, clubs take/aways, cafes etc nearby which was handy. Excellent and frequent bus service could get you into the city centre/temple bar area within 10 minutes. Walking took about 20-25 minutes to get into town. Our twin room was spotless and very comfortable. We couldn't have asked for a better place to stay! The spa facilities definitely topped it off! We will definitely be back sometime in August this year! Many thanks! :)",5,2014,03,27
248,50th birthday stay with friends,"Wonderful stay at this excellent Hotel,from arrival to checkout we could not of wished for a more enjoyable experience,My husband and I stayed with friends to celebrate his 50th birthday,hotels clean,lovely comfortable beds and food is first class. Location is ideal for city,with easy access by bus and it's within walking distance to lovely parks and museums,would defiantly return ",5,2014,03,26
248,"It was just ""ok""","The pictures that Camden Court puts on their website are deceiving. The room didn't look anything like the photos. The rooms were old and in need of updating. It wasn't the cleanest place I've ever stayed in, but I wouldn't say it was dirty either. On the positive side, the staff was great and the location was good.",3,2014,03,25
248,"Clean, comfortable and very friendly","We had a very enjoyable stay. The location is great, the room.was spotless and very comfortable. The breakfast was excellent but what made the visit special was the team working there. The staff are first class in every area in this hotel. ",5,2014,03,25
248,A++ a great nights sleep,"very very nice hotel, We had a room at the front, it was amazing, even though we where on the street we heard nothing, they had 2 sets of windows, fantastic, Very friendly staff, the doorman was a gent also, A+++",5,2014,03,23
248,gem on Camden Street,very nice hotel on camden street.  Staff very helpful and pleasant.  Nice spacious lobby with nice decor.  Room I stayed in was very nice and the bed was very comfortable.  Only drawback was the room was too warm and there was a bit of street noise in the early hours.  Breakfast was excellent.  Over all no hesitation in staying here again - well done,4,2014,03,20
248,value for money,"We recently booked a short two night city break at the Camden court hotel and were very happy with our stay from the initial booing on line the service we received was prompt and courteous

Our initial booking was for two nights with breakfast however due to a change in our antennary as we booked an early morning excursion which left before 7 am   so we would not require breakfast on the first night. This was dealt with promptly and satisfactory prior to our arrival. 
 On the day of our arrival we arrived at 11 am  3 hours before are official check in time and was very pleased to be advised our room was ready and we could check in, the receptionist was very pleasant and extremely helpful and informative.  

We booked a quite room which was located on floor 3 overlooking the courtyard, view not great but we never booked the room for the view , the room was pleasant although slightly dingy however we did ask for the courtyard view room as we knew this was the quieter room.

The bed was very spacious and comfortable.  The first night stay Thursday night was very quiet and we both slept without any problems with noise , albeit the second of the night’s stay Friday night was bit more noisy, having said that this was the Friday before St Patricks day so celebrations where starting to gain momentum

 The hotel provide free wi fi although the last morning we could not log on due to a conference in progress and all the band withy seem to have been used up.   
We must give a special mention to the Acerina on reception who thou out or stay was very helpful and polite and could honestly say was a credit to the hotel.  Anything we threw at her she sorted promptly and was very informative and helpful.

Breakfast  selection of cereals was pretty basic  compared to most hotels of this rating , the cooked Irish breakfast was average  but no shortage of toasters on hand if you like toast,  All in all breakfast was nothing special .

 General this was a pleasant stay the hotel is far enough away from the temple bar area if this is not your scene but is easy accessible to get if it is.",4,2014,03,16
248,Helpful front desk and entertaining bar staff,"Your staff provided excellent, prompt service after our overnight flight.  Discovering that our phones did not work, they quickly provided assistance in that manner and quickly found us an available room.  They also were knowledgeable and helpful in advising proper bus location, etc. to get us to the hurling match.  This was my second stay with you in Dublin (my first being before I knew about Trip Advisor) and I was pleased both times.  The bar staff were also notable with service, smile and a story or so.  We were aware of the fitness room and pool but were unable to take advantage due to the offerings of the city.  Your buffet breakfast provides a great jump start on a busy day of sightseeing .",5,2014,03,15
248,Great little place and close to EVERYTHING,"We stayed here in January.  I am used to big chains like Hilton and Marriott.  Very impressed with this little hotel.  Rooms were clean, hotel employees were friendly and morning breakfast was fabulous.  I will definitely stay here again!!  Great Job Camden Court!!",4,2014,03,15
248,FALSE advertisement of rooms online....Extremley disappointed!!!!,"I'm just back from an overnight stay at the Camden Court Hotel. I was looking forward to a relaxing 4star experience but unfortunately this was not the case. On arrival the girl checked us in and failed to mention any of the leisure or spa facilities that were available. Our room was booked for two people but we were provided with four beds? (Probably to try and make up for the poor standards).

The photos that we seen online were NOT the same rooms we were staying in. We paid £100 for an overnight stay in a four star hotel and this was not what we got. The hotel was very outdated, shabby and very basic. The carpet had several stains on the floor, the bathroom was full of hairs and the wifi took over twenty minutes to connect.

The only good experience of the hotel was breakfast - it had a large variety and plenty to pick from. On checking out the girl at reception asked, 'did we enjoy our stay?' I explained the room was not the same as the photos that were advertised online and that I was very disappointed in the room. She explained the hotel is doing some 'refurbishment' and some rooms aren't finished.

So when booking your room do you have to explain you want the same room that you seen online? Surely you shouldn't be mislead especially after paying £100 for an overnight stay. The girl at reception then joined in a conversation with another work who begun talking among themselves about the girl complaining bout 'her room'. The two girls decided to laugh among themselves and rolled their eyes. Extremeley unprofessional!!!! 

DEFINATLEY wont be back!!! FALSE ADVERTISEMENT OF ROOMS!!! NOT A 4 STAR HOTEL!!",2,2014,03,12
248,A Very Pleasant and Comfortable Stay,"I very much enjoyed my stay at this spacious, opulent and rather plush hotel. Nicely situated in an alcove just off one of the busy main roads with lots of excellent shops, bars and restaurants. Certainly one of the finest hotels I've experienced when staying in Dublin, and I have visited this city on more than a dozen occasions.
The staff were very helpful, polite and accommodating. The reception area has what looked like a large open lounge with very comfortable armchairs and sofas. Not overly modern in decor but at the same time not too old fashioned either, but very smart non-the-less.
The room was very inviting. Attractively furnished and fairly large. Good sized side table and a large long work table with comfy armchairs. Very comfortable bed with just the right firmness for the mattress and plump enough pillows.
Nice sharp picture on the large flat screen TV and good room lighting scheme. Very smart, roomy bathroom with a fairly powerful fixed shower with a very large shower head and a fairly large bath tub. Lots of luxury mini toiletries provided also.
It was a real bonus to have free wifi which performed really well.
I was able to enjoy a continental and delicious cooked breakfast in my room as you just tick off what you desire on the door card. A Superb quality meal! All for under 3 euros... And so of course I gave a good tip to the server.
I would not hesitate to stay at Camden Court Hotel again.",5,2014,03,11
248,Lovely city just-out-of-centre hotel,"Stayed here three weeks while working in Dublin and I can strongly recommend it 
The only thing that stops it getting five stars is the hopeless electricals
Three different rooms, only one had a power socket near the bed (for 'phone recharging, alarm clock, or laptop in bed etc.)
Staff offered an extension cord - a one metre extension cord which did no good at all
Wifi is generally good, TV channels are better than most Dublin hotels, staff are polite and efficient
External rooms can be noisy at night, courtyard-facing rooms to be preferred
All rooms were clean and in good condition
Very convenient for Harcourt LUAS, bit of a walk if you need to go in to city centre (I didn't)
Lots of local reasonably priced eateries
Pool is OK, if a bit cool, spa massage was OK but no better - probably overpriced for what it was",4,2014,03,05
248,One of the best hotels I've ever stayed in,"Arrived at the hotel early Friday morning 28th Feb & we were instantly given our room. The staff are very helpful & attentive to ours needs. They recommended pubs & restaurants which on visiting were true to their word. The Bleeding Horse pub next door is a must visit, lovely food & great staff. The breakfast was lovely & so was the food in the bar. We didn't eat in the restaurant but it looked a nice place.
I would have no hesitation in recommending this lovely hotel.",5,2014,03,04
248,Never again :( gutted,"Arrived to find we had no booking we book 2 weeks before are stay they had are card number except one digit they had the first name wrong second name and wrong address for us which was worrying for us as we had gave a lot of details over the phone for the booking. Another group beside us had also gone through the same problem as we waited. We felt really stressed made out they where doing us a favour and the 2 male desk staff where immature and un helpful one stood and smirked at us made us feel like just walking away, they gave us a small room with a double bed and we had booked for singles we then got speaking to the manager who reassured us he wld let us know what had happened which never happened, seen him the next morning at breakfast he avoided us was completely un professional all round, the lady that cleaned the room on the first morning was the only helpful person we experienced on are 2 nite stay. The breakfast was ok the warm food was poor quality and the fridge wasn't on where they where serving cold meet and salmon which was worrying as the room was warm. If u book also make sure and ask for the new part of the building as I have stayed once before and the first room smelt like a nursing home and was very drab the photos online of this hotel are not what u get yes u get the green throw on the bed they show in the picture but the refurb rooms don't feel the best either. My first stay wasn't much different I just thought I wld give them a second chance but honestly never again one other thing which they can't really help was there was vomit rite round the hotel outside I understand that's out of there hands but it wasn't to pleasant to dodge on ur way to get ur dinner it was from the hotel entrance all the way round to the bleeding horse bar at the other entrance. Never got a chance to use the pool ect it looked nice from a far the parking we asked about the ran out of spaces so over all never again I never write reviews but this annoyed me so much I want anyone else to avoid wasting there money and time I'm gutted to say the least ",2,2014,03,03
248,Excellent Stay,Stayed here for the weekend for my boyfriends birthday. Excellent location. Walking distance of Grafton Street and not far from Temple Bar/O'Connell Street. Stylish lobby and up to date rooms. Good quality wifi. The staff are very helpful and friendly. Overall a fantastic stay.,5,2014,02,26
248,Enjoyed it.,"Stayed here last week on a last min break, couldn't book family room on line  or on the phone, so emailed and yes they had a room with a double and single bed.
Not as good as the pictures on the web single bed way too old and sank in the middle.
When we went to go to bed a terrible noise so called reception and they sent housekeeping who couldn't hear anything,  the noise stopped about 12 midnight but started up early next morning, after requesting a quite room decided not to complain any more as we only had the 1 night left.
Breakfast excellent great choice. Pool good too. 
Would stay here again.",4,2014,02,24
248,Good location and amenities,"We stayed at the hotel for 3 nights as a familly break in Dublin. The hotel is well located a short distance fro St Stephen Green and Grafton street. The facilities are good - the leisure centre is very well appointed and clean.
The rooms can be hit and miss. the renovated rooms are very good - even if on the small side but par for the course in a city centre location. the older room are ... well outdated. We were told that the hotel should have the refurbnishment complete by the summer.
The breaksfast is very good. The buffet is varied and has a great choice of home cooked meats, fruits, cheeses. the cooked breakfast is quite decent too which is becoming a rarity in Dublin.
The staff is by and large very nice. Note that the hotel closes at night and if you are coming from a late night out you will need to show your credential to a night duty security guard - who is not as customer friendly as one would expect but hey he is here for security and does a good job at it.",4,2014,02,24
248,Nice time in dublin,"Stayed for a night in a family room and it was grand.  Baby cot was ready in the room as requested. Thank you.
We had dinner in the bar. Found that the chips for kids where too salty but they had them anyway. Main course for us was ok but right on the 3star standards. Breakfast was nice...staff were so nice to me and my boys. Pity we didn't get to use the pool this time we all had a flu.
Would stay in the hotel again next time as it was great and close to the city. Thank you. ",4,2014,02,19
248,Lovely hotel,"I didn't choose the hotel as it was selected for our group, Road Scholars, but it was a GREAT choice by them.  Lovely-sized room, spacious bathroom, luxurious towels, super eats in the dining areas, large, lovely lobby area and very helpful staff.  Indoor swimming pool was a great touch - we Floridians like to swim! - and the location was SO close to many, MANY things..we mostly walked everywhere (for 3 days of visiting).  Caught the great hop-on/hop-off tour bus, was able to walk to Temple Bar district (but taxi'd back, if you know what I mean!) :-)  Stephen's Green was very close and several groceries within two blocks for snacks/wine, etc.  Had a street view room so nothing to rave about there...I see someone else mentioned wi-fi but we didn't take our computer along... There was an internet rental shop - very cheap - only a block away so that's where I did e-mailing, flight check-in, etc. Had a group dine-in there and the service was super and the food (I had fish!) delicious and well-presented.  And The Bleeding Horse lounge (pub?) had wonderfully large screens for watching sports whilst having a sip. TWO thumbs up for the Camden Court.",4,2014,02,18
248,Recommended,"Hotel is located very well, only 10 min walk from Grafton street. Nicely decorated. Hotel room we had was big enough even we had a babycot in there, but it was bit overheated even we had the heater down to minimum (couldn't have window opened all night because of cot beside the window). Had to stay there for dinner because we got in late and had todler with us, food was nice but very limited option, only 3 course for 35 euro (I think choice of 4 starters, 4 mains and 3 desserts),if you want just main, it's 25e..waitress who served us that evening wasn't very nice but the other guy was very polite.
We went for swim after breakfast and pool area was very nice, we enjoyed it. We were happy after all..",4,2014,02,17
248,Great facilities and location,"We stayed at Camden Court over Valentines weekend and had a superb time.  We chose the hotel on its value and location and were not disappointed - it is less than 10 mins walk to Grafton Street/St Stephens Green and we found great restaurants a few minutes from its door (check out Il Primo Italian, it is excellent).

Check in was quick and friendly, and the room was clean, well proportioned and comfortable, although we were mostly in it to sleep!  The room was also warm and quiet.  Everywhere we went in the hotel had free wifi including our room which was a nice bonus.  There was however no room safe. 

Breakfast was excellent - a great range of cooked and cold food, and staff were quick to bring coffee and tea to the table.  We were also able to leave our baggage in the luggage room after checking out, and the desk staff kindly booked us a taxi back to the train station before we left.

It was about €10 in a taxi to Connolly train station and took around 15 minutes.  We would definitely stay at Camden Court again as a great value city centre hotel in Dublin.",5,2014,02,17
248,Would I stay there again ?...... Absolutely,Just back from an overnight stay in the Camden Court hotel and would have only positive things to say about the hotel. Location is very good close to the Luas green line and a short walk to St Stephens Green. The rooms are nice and very clean with a comfortable bed. The foyer area is spacious and welcoming. There is a  restaurant and a separate bar off the foyer area. The breakfast was tasty with plenty of choice and no issue with what ever portion you want. The added bonus is the leisure center. The gym is small but very adequate and the swimming pool is very intimate and very relaxing. When I'm over nighting in Dublin again I will no further than the Camden Court.,5,2014,02,14
248,Great central location and a nice place.,Great location. Walking distance from everything. Quite close to St Stephen's Green. Good facilities and a nice restaurant. The gym and pool are quite good. Parking is at the rear of the building. Nicely appointed,4,2014,02,11
248,Recommended,"Stay here last weekend for the rugby. rooms spacious and clean. Secure underground car parking is available as is a health club. Its central for St Stevens green and close to the Aviva. We had a bar snack on the Saturday evening which was reasonably priced and good. We all enjoyed or breakfast both mornings for which there was a large selection of hot and cold options. 
I would definitely stay here again.",5,2014,02,10
248,Excellent hotel,"Excellent hotel. Friendly staff. Beautiful room decor. Clean and modern. Lobby, reception, bar and restaurant all nicely maintained too. Nice gym and pool - small but sufficient. Very good value. A bit of a walk from city centre but worth it.",5,2014,02,10
248,Central Location,"This hotel has all the facilities including underground parking and a nice leisure centre.
The room was perfectly adequate, clean and functional but lacked character.  I did not dine here but there are a number of restaurants within a few minutes walk and Graften Street is only 10 minutes away. I would have no hesitation staying here again just because of its location.",4,2014,02,07
248,Excellent hotel in good  location,"Been staying here for several years now for rugby 6 nations. 

Hotel very clean, staff helpful and breakfast plentiful.

Good location with variety of bars, restaurants, shops and sights. Would recommend this hotel as well worth a visit if travelling with friends, family or couples.",5,2014,02,06
248,V good ,Very good hotel clean warm and great staff nice big room  right in the heart of dublin only downside was the pool was very very cold free car park  great little Irish pub next door called the bleeding horse good spot for a pint r somewhere to eat great hotel will b back,4,2014,02,05
248,Perfect location and great value,I stayed here during a stag do (we were all over 40 so nothing too outrageous) in January and found the rooms to be very clean and well appointed (I loved my big bath).  The staff were efficient and friendly and the breakfast was excellent.  An added bonus was the splendid Bleeding Horse pub next door.  I would not hesitate to stay here again when next in Dublin.,4,2014,02,03
248,"Great location, good value.","We booked here for a night out in Dublin. The staff were efficient and friendly.  Our room was clean and basic. The hotel provides free parking and also has a lovely spa/pool. Great location. Good value. But do book well in advance, it can be very busy and is definitely a popular Dublin city hotel.",4,2014,01,28
248,great hotel,"Stayed here a few times,great location and clean comfortable rooms.Excellent showers and spacious bathroom.Breakfast was nice with plenty of choice.Parking can be a problem if your not there early when busy.Overall good value comfortable hotel in a great location.",5,2014,01,21
248,Breakfast Problems,"Very  good location, well presented reception, comfortable bed rooms. Would stay again, but would not have pre purchased breakfast if knew it was buffet. The hot breakfast was stone cold, informed reception on return that evening, took little notice, the next morning said I would try for a ommeltte but the chef give me back the very minimum answer he could fried or scrambled, sat down with the healthy option only to see the table beside me served poached eggs. Mentioned all the above to reception and she said we should have pre ordered our breakfast. 13 euro for breakfast , more like 5 would be right.",3,2014,01,19
248,Excellent hotel !,"First time to stay at the Camden Court Hotel and will not be the last , the hotel is in a great location just minutes walk from the main shopping areas. The rooms are modern and clean.  We ate in the restaurant and the food was fabulous .  
Over all service from staff was excellent.
Lovely leisure centre so make sure to bring your swimsuit !",5,2014,01,18
248,Great hotel,"We stayed 2 nights at the Camden Court Hotel in Dublin with our Trafalgar Tour group on August 29,2013.

The hotel is very clean and comfortable and staff friendly. The lobby is huge with lots of comfortable chairs and sofas. Our room was on the 4th floor and it was very quiet.

It is centrally located with lots of pubs and shops within walking distance. The hotel is right next door to the famous Bleeding Horse pub but unfortunately we didn't have a free minute to go inside for a drink. 

Camden Street is a very busy street so be careful crossing it. I had a hair cut at the Miss World Hair Salon across the street from the hotel. Reasonably priced as compared the salon right next door to the entrance to the hotel!! 

We would not hesitate to stay at this hotel again.",5,2014,01,13
248,"Great location, food and facilities","Stayed here for work last time, first time in this hotel and this part of Dublin. Great location - plenty of good restaurants and lively bars along Camden St and Wicklow St. Late night Tesco across the road which is always handy. Ate twice in the hotel restaurant and once in the bar and the food was really top notch along with some very healthy options which are not always easy to get when you're away from home in a hotel. Breakfast was v good - fresh fruit, yogurts, meats, cheese, smoked salmon, pastries, soda bread, toast along with all the usual cooked options. The cooked breakfast was high quality - delicious eggs and mushrooms. Must say that the orange juice was gorgeous. Free wifi everywhere - essential for work. Good and well equipped gym and pool. Room was nice, good shower. My only quibble is that the towels were rubbish - small and thin ( a bit like me! Just as well my hubbie wasnt with me - towel wouldnt have gone round him!) and also every evening when I came back to the room, the housekeeping had left the bedroom window open all day long so the room was freezing - it's January!! Luckily there was a radiator in the room that I could turn on and off so I turned that on and headed straight down to the gym, room was warm again when I got back. Apart from that I look forward to staying here again for work and would also stay here for a weekend if we were coming up to a concert or other event as the area is great for socialising.",4,2014,01,11
248,Reasonable,"Hotel rooms are well equipped, beds are comfortable and the location is just a short walk from the main shopping area. I had only two issues with this hotel. The first one was cleanliness, we found a pair of dirty socks behind the curtains that didn't belong to either my husband or I. The second was the restaurant, food was overpriced and they hadn't a great variety, compared to the menu for room service meals which was far better and more affordable. 

Other than that, the reception staff were very helpful and any taxis we requested were always on time. Spa facilities are also worth a visit",3,2014,01,09
248,"A very good, affordable hotel in a great location","Our family stayed at the Camden Court Hotel for three days leading up to, but not including, the New Year's Eve Holiday.  It's a reasonably priced, better-than-average hotel with a great location in central Dublin.  It's within easy walking distance to virtually every major site in Dublin Center.  I recently stayed at the nearby Fitzwilliam Hotel on a business trip.  The Fitzwilliam is directly across the street from St. Stephen's Green but I found it over-priced and more style than comfort.  I asked a local friend for a recommendation and he suggested the Camden Court without hesitation.

It was an excellent recommendation.  The hotel is well maintained, equipped and warmly decorated.  The staff, from the front desk to the bartenders, were all very helpful and professional.  The lobby is well designed and spacious with comfortable seating where you can enjoy full bar and cafe service.

Our rooms were clean, very well maintained and included several welcome features, such as no-cost internet access.  The beds, linens, pillows and comforters were very clean and comfortable.  The rooms have great showers.

Full breakfasts were included in our rate and offered a great selection of both hot and cold foods.  All were fresh, well prepared and very good.  The eggs-over-easy were particularly good and most of the food is locally sourced.

I've stayed at several of Dublin's most expensive and well-known hotels but the Camden Court is my new favorite.  It might not be across the street from Trinity or Parnell Square, but it's only a few minute walk to almost every location.  It's a very good hotel and an exceptional value.",4,2014,01,04
248,Another great stay,"Just got back from 5 days at the Camden Court for new year's with friends.

We chose the Camden Court for our return trip to Dublin as we had enjoyed it so much 14 months ago for my Wife's 50th , and am delighted to say that we enjoyed it very much this time also.
The hotel is very nice throughout with excellent attentive staff in all areas. We were impressed to be given the same room as our last stay which was beautiful , the food here is divine and good v.f.m., and i enjoyed relaxing in the spa facilities which house a pool , sauna, steam room and jaquzzi  plus a well equipped gym.

The hotel is situated a short walk from St SStephen's green and Grafton Street about 7 minutes away.

If ever we visit Dublin again we will not hesitate to book the Camden Court again , and recommend it to any one thinking of visiting.",5,2014,01,02
248,I love this hotel,"This is my go to hotel for trips to Dublin. Fantastic location , great value , clean & comfortable - what more could you ask ?
Unfortunately the night porter first told us we had the wrong room number and then told us there was only 3 ppl on his list for the room when there were 4 of us & wasn't very nice in telling us - rude & unhelpful - I did relay this when I checked out - not what you need when you just want to go to bed.
We had food in the bar whilst waiting on our taxi and it was fab with great service.",5,2013,12,28
248,Another excellent stay at Camden Court Hotel,"We stayed here from Friday 13th Dec to  Sunday 15th Dec and yet again we definitely had no complaints of this hotel.  We have stayed here many times (2 adults and 2 kids aged 16 & 11).  We were on the 4th floor, Room 455.  This room was absolutely brilliant with  3 double beds, fridge and microwave !!! The hotel was 'buzzing'.  Cannot find a single thing to fault (as usual).  Excellent accommodation, excellent food, and staff were so helpful and mannerly.  Would not stay anywhere  in Dublin other than Camden Court Hotel.  Will be booking soon for a short break in February 2014.",5,2013,12,21
248,Rooms need major updating and look totally different vs on-line,"Rooms are sparse.
Furniture cheap. 
It's like stepping back in time to the 80's. 
Vending machines on each floor are deafening so avoid getting a room nearby. 
Bathroom has 80's style tiles which might have looked okay 30 years ago. 
Scuffs and missing paint on the walls in the rooms.  Clearly insufficient maintenance spend for years. 
Location however is good",2,2013,12,11
248,a bit grotty,"This hotel has the feeling of a fifties hotel in a poor seaside town. It is anonymous, and dull. The rooms seem to be a good size, ours was, as was the bathroom, and the bed was very comfortable…..that was all……on the whom the place feels unkempt and a bit unloved….It's not particularly well placed, except to get to the wonderful Green 19 for dinner!",3,2013,12,11
248,A Week-end with the Irish Cousin's,This is extremely well situated for getting around the middle of Dublin with the Luas right next door for getting around.    The Hotel is comfortable and the breakfast really good.   Also had a good meal in the restaurant with excellent service.    Extremely accommodating as regards space for visitors to have coffee etc.    If there was a problem it was the noise till early morning from the people standing outside the front smoking so not good for sleep.,4,2013,12,03
248,"great value, good location and good experience","This hotel is great for the price - the room was really clean and comfortable. The room was warm and the beds were good quality.  Reception was well run and the staff were friendly and helpful with directions and information. The breakfast was good value - lots of choice (hot breakfast, cold meats and cheese, cereals, yoghurt and fresh fruits and lots of toast and croissants) The leisure facilities are fine. It was an easy walk (about 15 mins at a brisk pace to the centre) All in all very good value and all you need for a reasonably priced weekend break.",5,2013,12,01
248,Average Hotel In Dublin,"I stayed at Camden Court Hotel in June 13' for 4 nights.  Camden Court Hotel is in a good location of Dublin.  It's a 10 minute walk to Grafton St. district, Dublin bus tour stop (hop on hop off bus) and a 15 minute walk to the Temple Bar district.  I arrived at the hotel at 8 am and check in was not available (no problem).  The front desk held on to my luggage until check in was available at 2 pm.  The lobby is nice and modern with plenty of comfortable chairs to sit on.  

When the room was ready upon walking into the room it was clean but average.  A clean room is all I ever ask for, anything more is great.  My room had a safe to hold my passport and other items.  My friends room did not have a safe, when we asked the front desk why, we were told no rooms had safes.  I guess I had a special room?  The hotel offers free Wi-Fi in the rooms and common areas, however you have to pay to use the computers in the lobby.  The hotel offers breakfast for 10 Euro extra, however breakfast does not start until 7 am.  If you have a tour set up for the morning, the hotels breakfast starts too late.  Both my tours of Ireland pick up time was 7 am and had to walk 10 minutes to Grafton Street.  The hotel has an indoor swimming pool, I did not use it because guest have to wear a swimming cap to cover their hair and you have to pay extra for it.  Kind of a silly policy considering there were many children in the pool probably urinating in it, but I guess hair is more of a problem for them.  The hotel does offer currency exchange but would not take any of my 100 USD bills, they only take $20 USD bills which I did not have on hand.  There is a nice bar next to the hotel called The Bleeding Horse which is pretty lively on the weekends.  

My stay at Camden Court Hotel was average.  The hotel is in a good location of Dublin and the rooms were clean.  If I came back to Dublin I would probably stay at another hotel that offers breakfast earlier than 7 am and does not make you wear a swimming cap in the pool.",3,2013,11,26
248,Great Stay,"Stayed one night in hotel, Staff was very helpful and nothing was too much trouble.  They helped booked coach and rail tickets for my parents and printed off confirmation receipts for them.  Rooms were lovely and clean and food was great.  Would defiantely use this hotel again and recommend to friends and family",5,2013,11,26
248,Good,"Stayed one night.hotel staff pleasant to deal with.got our room early.No problems.room clean and modern, good location, parking an issue.not many parking spaces in hotel car park.suggest come early for one if bringing a car.would return again.",4,2013,11,24
248,Amazing Service,"My sister and her husband had booked their first night in ages away from the children for themselves. I e-mailed in advance to arrange for drinks to be sent to their room. The Sales Director (Denise) was so professional and personable and made it so easy. We all really appreciated the attention to detail to make their visit memorable.
Well done CCH - other hotels need to take note!",5,2013,11,22
248,THREE NIGHTS IN DUBLIN,"The Camden Court is a excellent hotel ,lovely rooms, good located,very good breakfast full Irish,smoked salmon fresh fruit pastry's and  a lot more.This is a 3 star hotel and you pay 3 star price don;t know what more you could want ,all staff very helpful lovely pool. Worthy of 4 stars would recommend,and we would stay here again when visiting Dublin.We had a great time in Dublin what a lovely city.",5,2013,11,20
248,Great location and value for money!,"We stayed in the Camden Court Hotel for two nights. Unlike some other areas of Dublin, the hotel is located in a quieter area near St. Stephens Green meaning that we were able to get some sleep! The hotel staff where friendly and efficient. The bedrooms were clean, comfortable and stylish with free, fast and reliable WiFi. The hotel has a free underground car park which is a must for people like me bringing the car. We did not have breakfast during our stay. However, we did visit the restuarant and while we couldn't say anything about the quality of the food, the portion sizes were small for the price we paid. The only bad thing that really comes to mind is the state of the carpet in the hotel lifts. These badly stained carpets are not a geat first impression, but don't let these put you off staying here as the rest of the hotel is in a great condition. So to sum up, would I stay here again and also would I recommend this hotel to others? Yes I would.",5,2013,11,19
248,Well located and good value,"Whilst this hotel is a little tired in places, it is more than adequate for a business or singles trip to Dublin.  If you are going on a couples trip, you may want to seek out a bit more luxury.

The hotel has nice big rooms and good facilities.

All in all in a goof hotel.",4,2013,11,19
248,Great for just the night but undoubtedly there are better,"The hotel was busy, location was ok.  Rooms were mediocre and not thoroughly cleaned.  I dropped something on the floor that rolled just under the bed and when I tried to retrieve it a pile of garbage and random items came with it.  It was definitely gross.  The breakfast was ok.  I would choose another hotel when I return to Dublin.",3,2013,11,16
248,All good,"Spent 2 nights here recently on a business trip - friendly and efficient staff, clean, comfortable, spacious and well-equipped rooms, free, fast and reliable WiFi/broadband.  I didn't have time to try the breakfast but it looked good from a distance and the evening meal in the bar was fine.  

Usual Dublin selection of 'cold fizzy' bees, so not great for 'Real Ale' drinkers, but the Guinness was  good.  I would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone wanting a quality hotel at a reasonable price on the south side of Dublin's city centre.",5,2013,11,16
248,Great hotel,"This was a truly great experience.  Good location.  Friendly staff.  I will stay here again.

Breakfast was great every morning   We trusted and enjoyed the free wi -go. 

The rooms were extremely comfortable and well decorated. The bath rooms were first class.  ",4,2013,11,15
248,Good for a weekend break,"I stayed at this hotel from fri 1st nov to sun 3rd, in a twin room with a friend. 
Location: If you're prepared to walk, then everything is in walking distance, I'd say approx 20mins to main bars at 'Temple Bar' district and 40min walk to Guinness factory, nice walk on a good day.
Room: very dated, however clean sheets & towels and clean bathroom. We laughed hysterically at we thought was a 1960s hair dryer affixed inside a draw - it worked, but again highlighted how dated the room was. 
Pool & spa: another hysterical thing you must be prepared for is compulsory swimming hats for swimming in the pool BUT, you can sit and dip your head in the jacuzzi WITHOUT a swimming hat - very odd. This resulted in an empty pool and a very cramped jacuzzi. of all the hotels in the world I've stayed, I've never been told I have to buy a swimming hat at €2.50 so I can swim in the pool.
Bar and food: great bistro type food. We dinned at the hotel Resturant and were happy with the food and wine we were served. We even had live music on the Friday night.
Overall great hotel for a short city break close to shopping and tourist areas",4,2013,11,13
248,"Great Service, Excellent Conference Facilities","I teach all around the world and I can say that Camden Court has some of the most pleasant and responsive conference staff you'll find anywhere on the globe - friendly, efficient and meticulous about following up on details.

They get everything right the first time, then ask what else they can do.

It's a real pleasure to work with them delivering an event.",5,2013,11,12
248,Excellent hotel ,I have stayed in the Camden Court loads of times. I was here Sat night too so decided it was about time that I reviewed it. I love this hotel. It's in the perfect location if your going on a night out in Dublin. All the best pubs/clubs surround this hotel which means you rarely need to get taxis etc. They have free parking and plenty of space so even on a busy Sat there is no problem getting a spot. The rooms clean and comfortable. Staff are friendly. I've stayed here loads of times and I will be back again soon. ,5,2013,11,10
248,Free Parking,We completed our holiday in Ireland with a 3 night stay in Dublin at this hotel. We were initially attracted to this hotel because it had free secure parking and seemed reasonably priced. All in all the hotel was a good find. The room was comfortable with the only downside of having to draw the curtains a lot as the rooms look into each other across a quadrangle. This was not much of a problem as we did not spend very much time in the room. The breakfast was really good with loads of choice of hot and cold items. We found all the staff to be helpful and welcoming. The location was good for us as we spent our evenings in the Temple Bar district which was about a 20 minute walk and gave us just enough exercise. Also we found Whelans bar about half way between Temple Bar and the hotel and we enjoyed the stop off on the way back for some contemporary music. We would be happy to stay at this hotel again.,4,2013,11,09
248,Lovely hotel close to most things in Dublin,"We stayed at this hotel for 4 nights….2 nights with Trafalgar Tours & 2 nights booked independently.  We were most pleased when our cab arrived at the hotel.  Lobby is very large & welcoming.  Check in process was quick & staff most courteous.  Our friends had arrived from out of the country about 1/2 hour before us & the hotel was able to give us rooms directly across the hall from each other.  The rooms were lovely with very comfortable king beds. There was a bit of noise at night from the streets.  We were there doing the All Ireland Gaelic Football Finals, so not unexpected.  No A/C so you will want to be able to leave window open at night. We had breakfast included on the nights that we were there with Trafalgar.  Breakfast very typical of hotels with a buffet set up.  We would have had to pay 15 euros each for breakfast when booking on our own…..definitely not worth that amount.  We just went up the street to a local cafe & had a lovely breakfast for half that cost.   The hotel is about a 15 min. walk to the main shopping street, St. Stephens Park & Trinity College.  There are some small restaurants & pubs nearby.  Attached to the hotel is a pub which serves pub food & has a nice vibe about it.  Would definitely recommend this hotel if you are visiting Dublin.",4,2013,11,08
248,Excellent,"Camden court hotel is very good hotel is in great location (10min walk to Grafton street). 
Very friendly kind and helpful staff. Lovely meal (dinner & breakfast). 
Nice tidy spacious room with comfortable beds . Hotel has private secure parking., free WI FI.
Would stay here again and highly recommending this hotel for business, city break or any other occasion.",5,2013,11,07
248,Good budget hotel,"I like the Camden Court Hotel, it is in a great location. Had a lovely meal in the Bar served by a vey friendly, pleasant young girl. Very comfortable beds and pillows (sometimes pillows are too soft or too hard) Heating in rooms is individually controlled.",3,2013,11,04
248,Great Hotel,"I love the Camden Court Hotel, it is in a great location. Had a lovely meal in the Bar served by a vey friendly, pleasant young girl. Very comfortable beds and pillows (sometimes pillows are too soft or too hard) Heating in rooms is individually controlled.",5,2013,11,03
248,Nice cosy hotel not far from centre . Free car parking,Consistantly good hotel . Quiet . Parking and walking distance to centre . Was at fleetwood mac . And had good experience .. Usual standard for class . Recommend . Only problem in morning was sat nav took me up one way street on way out of city and got stopped by guards . Not hotel fault . !! ,5,2013,11,02
248,Great hotel with friendly staff and a perfect location,"We arrived as part of a group from iceland for an annular company gathering, we enjoyed every night of our 7 day stay imensely especially those two young guys in the bar andy and darren who looked after us until early hours of the morning thanks again guys from Anna and the rest of the islandic family.",4,2013,11,02
248,Free parking in Dublin is valuable.,"I stayed at a twin room for 2 nights with my wife and son for joining Dublin Marathon. Free car parking is valuable in such a busy city. The room was clean and large enough (with a bathtub) while the beds were not so big. Breakfast was fine. The staff were kind and helpful. Overall we were very satisfied with our stay.
      
      ",4,2013,11,01
248,Excellent Stay!,"Stayed here for just one night at the beginning of October. We booked 2 double rooms and was given 1 double which had been refurbished, and one bedroom so large it could only be described as a suite. It had 2 double beds, a large bathroom and a lot of extra space! This room was not one of the refurbished ones but that didn't matter! Breakfast was fantastic, hot buffet served to you buy the chef and also a large range of cold items, including yogurts and smoked salmon! The tram stop is about 50m to the right of the entrance of the hotel and is the same distance in the other direction to a street full of convenience stores.

The hotel were very accommodating as we left our bags in the secure room while we went out during the day (before check in time and after check out time). Also we stayed out until the small hours with many clubs along the next street (Harcourt Street) and there was a security guard at the entrance of the building confirming you were guests on our return. Made us feel very safe and well looked after. Never got the chance to use the leisure facilities sadly :( 

The best part of our stay was the price we paid (£52 each for the night). Just cannot beat the location and facilities for the money! Wouldn't hesitate to stay again.",5,2013,10,30
248,"Comfortable, clean but noisy","A good hotel: clean, comfortable and well located for meetings south of the river. I stayed on the street side of the hotel and it was really very noise: traffic and people passing by. My night sleep was disturbed but I bought earplugs and then the second night was perfect. So - great hotel if you remember earplugs or are a heavy sleeper!",4,2013,10,25
248,Great overnight stop,"We were attending a party in Dublin and decided to stay over.  This hotel was an excellent choice for us as it was very central.  Check in was very efficient and friendly, the room was of a very good standard for the price we paid.  We also used the car parking facility as we did not want to drive, most useful.  As we wanted to get back home early we didn't have breakfast but the dining facilities looked good.  Would certainly stay here again.",4,2013,10,21
248,excellent value for money,"We arrived with my colleagues to the hotel in the evening and stayed for 2 nights. The room was big enough and it was quite new. The location is great, you can walk to Trinity, it is about 10-15 minutes or take a tram, the stop is just around the corner. Free wifi in the hotel. The restaurant is good, we had a dinner there and it was nice. The breakfast was excellent as well. I would recommend the hotel for business and tourist visitors.",5,2013,10,20
248,In between average and very good,"The hotel was clean, rooms are dated , although i think some rooms have been upgraded as my room looked nothing like the room on the welcome film. I thought every room had a safe these days but obviously not. The staff were very friendly and helpful both around the hotel and at breakfast. My hotel room overlooked the main road so on a night it was very noisy. Breakfast was a good selection, it was very busy every day I went down and I sometimes had to wait for a seat but it was not long. I wanted to give 3 and a half stars, as I thought it was above average but not quite very good , I would stay again but would ask for a refurbished room not overlooking the main road.",3,2013,10,19
248,Delightful,"Me and my wife arrived with a large group of visitors thursday afternoon and stayed for three nights. Considering that they are only a three star hotel the room was very spacious and the beds comfortable. The staff was nice and very helpful and recommended nice restaurants. The breakfast was amazing. Full Irish breakfast with nothing missing. Loads of yogurt and fruits, toasts and cold cuts and cheese. The only thing that I missed was a small refrigerator in my room. But you could always get a lot of ice from the ice machine.",4,2013,10,14
248,Very Accomodating!,Arrived early for our reservation at 5:30 am and the managment did everything possible to get us the first available room.  When we were unable to get right into the room they gave us breakfast and coffee and stowed our luggage for us.  Very helpful people.,5,2013,10,10
248,Kept awake the whole night,"Very nice hotel with a good restaurant and friendly staff. Unfortunately was given a room right next door to the lift shaft and a fire door. Inconsiderate guests came back to their rooms at all hours of the night and the morning, talking loudly and banging the fire door. It felt like I was living on Oxford Street! Guests would talk loudly and bang on doors constantly! Didn't sleep at all. When checking in, ensure you're not given a room near the lifts",2,2013,10,09
248,Moulin Rouge,"What can I say about the Moulin Rouge night we attended at the Camden Court Hotel.  The staff were amazing, nothing was too much trouble and they looked after us to the best and the entertainment was fab, up dancing all night :)  and the food..... yum will be going back for for lunch or dinner again :)",4,2013,10,08
248,Excellent,"Cannot fault this hotel, it is smack bang in the middle of town, a stones throw away from bars, restaurants, clubs and shops. The leisure centre was lovely and dinner/breakfast was very pleasant. Perfect for business trips or a couples night away.",5,2013,10,08
248,An overlooked gem of a hotel,"We spent a most agreeable weekend at Camden Court in a family room with 2 double beds and a single and even though if you open a window it is noisy throughout the night that's to be expected when staying in a capital city.Beds comfy and room immaculately clean.Central Bar does reasonably priced meals and bar snacks and checkin in swift and hassle free.Breakfasts are tasty and enormous and cater for all tastes if you not up to a ""Full Irish"".The pool is first rate as are gym facilities and the hotel is excellent value for money and have stayed many times as only 5 minute walk from St Stephens Green and Grafton Streets assorted attractions.We next over in July and have booked already.We used to stay @ Westbury and Fitzwilliam but this place costs a lot less and really punches above its weight.The pool clinches the deal for us.",4,2013,10,07
248,Comfortable rooms and amenities,"I would rate this hotel as above average for Dublin. I've stayed in a number of three-star hotels in Dublin, and this is by far the best one I've stayed in. Although I was not there on business, I noted that the place was set up very well for business travelers. The wifi worked perfectly, I had no problems connecting when I had to do some work, and my room had a desk with adequate space to get my work done. The breakfast was good, there were several options and generally they were all perfectly fine (although nothing special). The bed was not terribly plush, but I'm not very picky when it comes to mattresses, so it was fine for me. One thing to note is that while it is not right in the center of Dublin, it is not a difficult walk at all to get to all of the Dublin attractions, particularly St. Stephens Green, Grafton Street, and Trinity College (which are just a short walk down Harcourt Street). Definitely would recommend if you are looking for a comfortable, affordable option, business or pleasure.",4,2013,10,06
248,Home Away from Home,"This was my 17th time staying at the Camden Court Hotel. Every time I take a vacation to Dublin there is no hesitation when asked 'What hotel'. 

Ciara at the Front desk is a revelation and her enthusiasm for her job is evident. She is like a little ray of sunshine. David and John in the Bar make you feel so welcome and ensure that you get top notch service. 

All the staff are so friendly and work hard so you may enjoy your stay.

To all this hotel is known as the Camden Court Hotel but to me it is always ""my home away from home'",5,2013,10,05
248,Long term resident working in Dublin,"I have stayed at the Camden for some weeks now whilst working in Dublin and am happy to come back. Staff are enthusiastic, professional and courteous. Food and drink are good. Leisure centre is functional. Very handy location for a ton of great eateries. Reception are more than happy to recommend and their choices were spot on every time. Sure, it's not uber-modern nor tres chic sexy. It's an honest, busy hotel that is used by business folk and the Coach-tours-of-Ireland (with heaps of Eurpoean & US, er, more mature guests). Tips? Try to get a room that's not facing the main road because it can be noisy at night. That said, I think the office workers in the block behind the hotel must get an eyeful on occasion as some rooms have direct line of sight. Let's keep those curtains closed now people :o))",4,2013,10,04
248,Fantastic place,"Very highly recommended, The staff is very nice and friendly. The location is fantastic and its 5 mins walk distance from the centre. The food was fantastic and delicious. I recommend it for anybody who would be visiting Dublin.",5,2013,10,04
248,"Location, location, location.","Courteous and friendly staff, rooms adequately appointed, in house pub and restaurant. Minutes walk to St Patrick's Cathedral, Temple Bar or Steven's Green. Best of all- free parking. No breakfast but close to a variety of coffee shops and restaurants. Great place to explore Dublin from.",4,2013,10,03
248,Its has a nice staff thats all,"Place has nice staff need to clean the place more often , rooms are going chaep rate still clean room is what the visitors want , wouldnt stay there if we have choice ,must say if we do go back it will be for the nice service we recived from the friendly staff , ",3,2013,10,03
248,"Excellent Hotel, location excellent and rooms spotless","I stayed in hotel over the All Ireland re play weekend and the hotel was fully booked and ran like clock work from the reception staff right down to the parking. We arrived at the hotel before check in time and spoke to the reception and we were able to check in early which was amazing, room was very spacious and beautifully decorated. The pool area was excellent and facilities in the locker room were very good. The Bar is lovely and reception area nice for a pre bed drink, was very comfortable and relaxing there. Location was a huge bonus, shopping so close on the Stephens Green side and amazing night life on George St side of the hotel. Tescos express and spar shop beside hotel which is handy for daily papers and cold drinks / snacks for the room. Will defiantly be back again.",5,2013,10,03
248,location and service!,"Recently stayed for 3 nights with a large group...rooms were all acceptable, but what separates this hotel from the pack is the location (5 minutes to Stephen's Green) and service from staff. Nikki in the dining room took exceptional care of us and made sure our food was not only very good, but promptly served. Kudos to her and all of her staff. Likewise for the front desk staff...always very courteous and helpful. We will return.",4,2013,10,02
248,"Highly recommend, great bar food",Our 2 nights stay in the dublin was exceptional all the bar staff deserve a well done pat on the back for there hard work i must point out Darren done great job looking after us until the early hours of the morning I've never met such a young enthusiastic young man like him the camden court was by far our pick of hotels during our stay in ireland thanks again for the great hospitality from all the Arizona gang. ,5,2013,09,30
248,Finally a Hotel with an Internet Connection!,"Stayed here on the 1st night and last night of our Trafalger tour of Ireland.  Both times we stayed were fine.  Camden Court seemed to be the only hotel on our tour which had a decent internet connection.  We arrived to Dublin Airport at 4:30 am and went to check in at the hotel.  Unfortunately they did not have any rooms available right away, but did allow us to store our luggage until one became available.  We were in our rooms by 10:00 am and were able to take a nap before meeting our group.",4,2013,09,29
248,Great for long weekend,"I went for a long weekend with family and partner and although the bedding is a bit crazy on the eyes I have no complaints.

The staff were lovely, the breakfast amazing, they were renovating something in the area downstairs where the swimming pool was but I didn't bring a costume so never checked that area out.

Would recommend this hotel a million times!",5,2013,09,28
248,Camden Court Hotel,"Camden Court hotel was a great hotel, central to all the main attractions including:  Temple Bar, Trinity College, Christ church, etc.  There was also a lot of good restaurant's in the area as well as some good pubs.  Just remember your in Europe and everyone walks, so a mile walk isnt very far to see the attractions.  
The hotel rooms where nice and clean and the food was pretty good although all we had was breakfast.  One thing you should know is that the rooms do not have A/C but the windows do open so it can get a little humid in the summer.

Heres a tip:  Parking is very limited so get there early if your renting a car.",4,2013,09,25
248,Not great!,"I have to say after reading the reviews for this hotel I was expecting a decent stay in Dublin.
Not one to ever write a review, on this occasion however I felt compelled to do so. Having requested an early check in time and on arriving at the hotel at 9am I understood I would have to wait at least an hour to check into my room as I stated a check in time of 10am. I was eventually checked in at 12.35pm the reason I was told because the cleaners had only prepared family rooms and not any doubles! Surely that could’ve been rectified with a simple phone call? Not so. Having eventually been given a room it was situated next to the door in the hallway which banged every time someone came in and out! Nightmare if you actually plan on sleeping! The room itself was very average, there were scuff marks on the walls and the curtains did not fully block out the daylight so if you are expecting a sleep in you will need to use an extra blanket to block out the sun. The pillows were also extremely uncomfortable and it was difficult to get a decent nights sleep because of them. The hotel also comes with a swimming pool and leisure centre but the guests have to fork out €12 for the pleasure of using it! Really??I also requested a late check out only to be woken up by a phonecall asking why we hadn’t vacated the room! A simple note on the system would have prevented this. The staff were nice but it just seemed the whole place was a complete shambles in terms of service.
I will say though the location was great, and it was close to great bars and cafes! It also had free wifi and free parking! Would I recommend this hotel?! Afraid not, do yourself a favour and stay in the Paramount in Temple Bar a much better hotel on every level.",2,2013,09,24
248,Downtown Dublin Beauty,"Can't think of one complaint.  The staff was exemplary, always kind and helpful.  Not the easiest place to find but within walking distance of most of the sights of Dublin.  We spent four nights here in September of 2013.  Very clean, hotel dining room was very nice and the food was excellent.  Try the Persian restaurant down the street.  Lots of fun and good food.  We never had to move the car.  In Dublin that is a great thing!  The only negative thing is that the towels were a bit on the smallish side!",5,2013,09,22
248,Good for one night,"We only stayed for one night and to be fair, didn't spend much time in the hotel. We arrived and room was ready but I was disappointed to find that our room was not a recently decorated room and was out-dated and in serious need of modernisation. This was really off-putting as when we booked we watched the video on the hotels site, so were expecting a lovely modern room :-(. I hope we weren't disadvantaged by booking through super breaks rather than directly with the hotel. The room hove was clean and adequate for an overnight stay...if we'd been staying longer I would have asked for another room. Breakfast was good and the hotel staff were very helpful. It was also great to have free parking at the hotel and check out was midday which was good. If we'd have had an updated room I would have given this hotel 4/5.",3,2013,09,20
248,Great value central hotel,"We were pleasantly surprised by this hotel. Staff were helpful. Room was good- comfy bed and nice bathroom. Free wifi was good too. Pool and jacuzzi were excellent. Would definitely stay here again- close enough to the centre to walk and plenty of restaurants and bars nearby too. It's not 5 star luxury but we would choose it above a 5 star place based on location, facilities, price and service. Oh- breakfast was great- lovely fresh fruit not just fried stuff! ",5,2013,09,20
248,Good Base to see Dublin,"Good Points- Friendly staff, very helpful. Lovely Breakfast- would recommend -really sets you up for the day! Clean rooms, 10 min walk to Grafton St and St Stephens Green. Great steam room and Jacuzzi. We arrived at 9:30am, and our room was ready for us to check into-really nice touch after a long journey!

Bad Points- Our room was in major need of updating-very 80s décor, old furniture ect. Hotel pool was too shallow to swim in-only 1.4 metres deep, and strange rule of having to buy a shower cap for 2.50 euro before you can swim.
All in all, great base to see the city, the hotel is in a rather run down part of Dublin, but its close enough to the centre for it not to be an issue. Would recommend!

Side note- Do not use the Airbus to get to and from Hotel. We bought return tickets, and the bus is meant to come every 10 minutes, but when waiting to be taken back to the airport, we waited for 40 minutes in the rain for one to turn up. If there are 2 or 3 of you, it works out the same price to get a taxi!",4,2013,09,18
248,Well kept centrally situated hotel - free WiFi :),"I have stayed at Camden Court twice now for business and will happily stay here again and again. The staff are very friendly and helpful, the food in the Iveagh is very good (if a little on the expensive side) and the bar is excellently stocked - Paulaner on draught came as a pleasant surprise. The bar also shows high profile football matches so you will always be able to see the game - and if they havent, go to The Bleeding Horse next door where they have approximately 67264752745286486 televisions showing every game you could possibly think of. Didnt use the gym or pool this time but they looked fantastic. Would recommend to anyone thinking of staying close to the centre of Dublin for a reasonable price. Very importantly this hotel offers free WiFi which is becoming a necessity with business travel these days (and of course for your own personal stuff too!). Breakfast was also very good, i highly recommend the Irish White Pudding, a spicy treat to kickstart the morning!",4,2013,09,18
248,Great service abopve and beyond expectations,I've been staying regularly at this hotel for almost a year now and although they don't get everything perfect 100% of the time if they let you down in any way they sort it immediately. On top of that anyone who remebers my birthday and leaves me a card and bottle of wine in my room is going to keep me as aloyal customer!,5,2013,09,17
248,Some Serious Staff Issues,"I stayed at the Camden Court hotel for 2 nights recently with my partner and we had a very mixed experience during our stay.  On arrival we were given a very cold greeting from Madga the receptionist who would answer the phone without an excuse me while we were checking in, this happened several times.  Her manner was very curt and to be honest I would expect a little more.  Our room was very comfortable however I noted that we had been situated right beside the double doors leading to the lift which kept us away most of the night.  We did complain the next morning and the Duty Manager Thomas did move us to a quieter room (which was larger).   He reduced our bill and gave us a free breakfast.  Breakfast was fine however one point here none of the staff have English as a first language and I noticed this caused massive confusion with others who didn’t have English as a first language either.

Later on the second day I tried to make a phone call and our phone had been locked I called down to reception only to get through to the wonderful Magda, her manner on the phone was nothing short of rude and unprofessional.  I have never dealt with such a belligerent receptionist before.

Over all I wouldn’t stay here again, some of the staff I feel need a little extra training.  Even though the rooms have been refurbished recently they are a little rough around the edges and it’s clear that no snagging was done while they were being redecorated.  I feel the daily rate is far too expensive for what they are offering and the quality of service from staff.",3,2013,09,17
248,"Staff staff staff - couldn't fault anyone - super professional, super friendly ... super time ... Thank you ...","We recently stayed in the Camden Court for a hen.  
Stephanie (events) organised everything with such professionalism and friendliness ... She reserved an area to ourselves, where we sipped beautiful cocktails and nibbled on gorgeous finger food. Dave and the boys were so friendly and efficient in the bar that our couple of hours flew by. 

The gang on reception were equally top drawer!! And Andy (Christian) was so sound in the residents bar that we all said we couldn't fault any member of staff during our stay! A stones throw from town, reasonable rates and a yummy bfast next morning rounded off our fab wend!! 

Can't wait til our next girlie wend away and we will defo be staying here ... .... oh and a free tip - check out Cassidys Pub on Westmorelands Street - deadly tunes - great staff and cracking atmosphere !!!! ",5,2013,09,17
248,"Lovely Hotel, Great location & Brilliant leisure facilities","We stayed here for 3 nights at the end of August/beginning of September.  The hotel is lovely and clean.  We stayed as a family with a four month old baby.  The room was a good size especially with the buggy etc we had for the wee one.  The staff were very helpful especially in taking the bottles to be sterilised each day.  The breakfast was great and set us up for the day but it was expensive to buy in the hotel - Tip:  Book B & B before you go if you can.  I'm sure it would be cheaper than paying in the hotel (This option wasn't given to us when we booked through our provider).  
We were on the fourth floor and the room overlooked the main street which was noisy even at night - we had to sleep with the window closed.  Wasn't a big problem but the room can get warm.
The location was great. The hotel is a five minute walk from grafton street & St Stephen's green.  All other tourist atrractions are within walking distance providing you don't have mobility issues.  We were able to walk everywhere we wanted to go.
The leisure facilities were great - our baby girl loved the pool.  The steam room, sauna and jacuzzi were also great.  
Would definately stay again :-)",4,2013,09,16
248,Pleasant hotel,"We stayed here on two separate nights while on vacation in Ireland- on Sept 5 and 10. First night was ok- needed to sleep with window open and there was a lot of street noise. Second night, we were in a wonderful room on the 5th floor and can only assume that the roof line helped with the noise- slept with no problems!  Both rooms were nice and clean- beds satisfactory.  Breakfast was standard buffet- food was fresh and coffee good. Wifi connection was strong in the rooms.  Hotel is easy walking distance to many sites including Guiness storehouse and Temple bar area.

248,Excellent,"Stayed 2 days , one night, 10th and 11tth Sept under Oaklee Homes Group for a mini conference.
FOOD, SERVICE, ACCOMMODATION AND BUSINESS FACILITIES WERE TOP CLASS. Of course I have stayed before and am down again next week.",5,2013,09,12
248,Delightfull stay,"Road Scholar ""Best of Ireland"" booked our group at Camden Court for four nights.  The hotel was very professional in every way, room service, breakfast and dinner were fine.  The front desk was extremely help in recommending restaurants and out of the way exploring.  The hotel made a good recommendation for a golf outing at Howth along with transportation, and club rentals .",4,2013,09,11
248,Well Done!,"We stayed at this Hotel three nights. The room was well done, clean and the beds comfortable. The bathroom was very good. The Spa and Pool was clean and well done. The lobby was large, and the Pub had American Football, so I was very Happy. The Breakfast was included and good, but the fried eggs were always well done (we like runny yokes). That should be the worst thing to say about the Camden Court Hotel.",4,2013,09,11
248,One of Dublin's Finest,"Recently my wife and I stayed at this fine hotel.  High speed, free wifi available as well as nice
restaurant and bar.  Also had indoor swimming pool and exercise room.  Centrally located
10 minutes one direction to St. Patrick's cathederal and 10 minutes other direction to
Grafton street shopping area.  Would highly recommend this fine hotel with all the amenities
of a 4 star hotel.",4,2013,09,11
248,"Nice hotel, okay location","I was surprised at how upscale the Camden Court is. The staff is plentiful and extremely helpful.  Facilities are first rate. The room was small, but clean and comfortable. the only reason I rated this hotel a 4 instead of a 5 is because of its location. The neighborhood is a little ruin down, and it is a 15-minute walk to St. Stephen's green, where you can catch a hop-on/hop-off bus. If you do not mind walking, the location is not an issue. I would stay at this hotel again.",4,2013,09,11
248,Overall good hotel & location,"My husband and I enjoyed this hotel and felt it provided value for money. No problem getting a car park and the location was good as each day we walked up to St Stephen's Green etc. The breakfast provided many options of hot and cold food certainly met our requirements, with our small son enjoying the bacon/sausages etc. 
The room was a good size - we had 3 beds (2 double and a single). However the double beds were quite small so we ending up having one each ! Also the rooms were quite warm and when windows were open it was very noisey from the road (not a problem when windows closed). 
We ate in the hotel pub downstairs and had 2 lovely meals in there and the staff were friendly and efficient, and it was a reasonable price. This suited us as we had our 4yr old son with us. We would stay here again if back in Dublin. Recommend the hop on/hop off bus to get a good tour of Dublin if you are new to the city, we found it very useful.",4,2013,09,11
248,Good Accommodation -Not so good breakfast,"We have stayed in Camden Court Hotel many times. It is very conveniently situated with five or ten minutes of St. Stephen's Green and Grafton St. The bedrooms are not luxury but more that adequate for the very reasonable price charged.The hotel is quite large so it lacks the intimacy of a smaller hotel but the staff are pleasant and efficient. I would give this hotel a much higher rating but for the breakfast. For a hotel of this size the breakfast quality, choice and service is very poor. If you are not in the diningroom before 9am food runs out and is not replaced. The choice of fruit is poor. Cold meats are all piled up on a single plate. If you don't get a waiter to get you a pot of coffee you have to pour yourself from a thermos-style jug. Fruit juice comes out of a push-button machine. Cooked breakfast is limited to bacon, egg and sausage type. All in all the breakfast lets the whole establishment down. There are numerous cafes in Camden St which offer tasty breakfasts for anyone who wishes to eat elsewhere. Having said all that I think the Camden Court hotel is very good value for money especially if you have children and get a family room. I will continue to stay there.",4,2013,09,10
248,GREAT SPOT,My wife & I have stayed here twice and are very impressed with both the staff's helpful attitude and the Iveagh Restaurant - especially Breakfast! Wonderful place highly recommended! We will definitely stay here again when returning to Dublin!,5,2013,09,09
248,Love This Hotel!,"Great hotel, great prices, I've stayed here tones of times, rooms are modern and stylish, pool is fab, location is great!! It's been a while but I will be back!! Got room only so can't comment on the food.",5,2013,09,05
248,Sister's Hen Party,"Stayed here last weekend of august for my sisters hen party.

Booked this a couple of months ago. Staff allowed us a room rate of 115 euros for a triple room which was brilliant as it worked out so reasonable for all hen goers to stay there both nights.

Although i didnt get to the pool which i had planned to do on the Saturday i can only commend the wonderful staff for helping me with preps and emails before my stay and also allowing me use of the meeting room on the saturday to play a few hen games complimentary as it wasnt being used.

Sandra was the kind lady who arranged use of the room and Blannad the manager on the day who very helpfully assisted us to set up and ordered us taxis.

Other staff at reception helped with my enquiries before arrival

really central location 

only negative was we did ask for refurbished rooms and mines was not although the bride was given an amazing;y lovely room which is all that mattered :)",5,2013,09,04
248,comfortable and well-appointed,"Camden Court hotel in Dublin has hit the mark on many of my sine qua non criteria for a very good hotel; they're clean, they respect my privacy; they're comfortable, courteous, and well located.  The fact they had my room ready when I arrived at eleven impressed me, and nothing they've done or neglected to do hasannoyed me (in no small part because they've neglected nothing at all).

The hotel is big and corporate, so it lacks a modicum of human warmth, but I won't fault them for that, not one bit.",4,2013,09,04
248,Loved the location !,"We usually stay at the Gibson but couldn't get it so said we'd give this one a try , very happy we did , great location opening onto a very lively and interesting street , ok so plus points are ....location , free parking , nice pool and sauna , very good breakfast , friendly service , lots of cheap eateries in vicinity ....these are the bad points , drunken revellers one night at 4:30 am in hallway had to have a heated discussion ( otherwise hotel was quite ) , shower come bath was rubbish , better of to go down to the pool for a decent shower , no fridge in room , poor picture on old type flat screen tv .... All in all I would give this hotel the thumbs up and I imagine we will be back again ...",4,2013,09,03
248,Reasonable base for time in Dublin,"Spent 2nights in this hotel. The rooms were rather stuffy (no aircon), but they will provide fans. 
Beds are comfortable, and the rooms are very clean. Some of the rooms are quite noisy (the hotel is close to a main road), so ask for room that doesn't overlook the street or the car park.
The breakfast is good. The hotel is a relatively easy walk from the centre of Dublin, or a few stops on the monorail.",4,2013,09,01
248,Birthday Treat,Stayed with daughters and granddaughter for weekend as a Birthday treat. The location was very central and parking was just below hotel (free).  The Bistro and Dining Room were both equally good ate in both and the breakfast catered for every taste.  We also used Swimming Pool  and it also  was free.  Staff were more than courteous and very helpful.  The rooms were fresh and clean  but very warm during the night (of course weather was exceptionally warm for end of August in Ireland). I would recommend this hotel.,2,2013,09,01
248,Still our go to hotel in Dublin,"My wife, 2 small kids and I just stayed at the Camden Court for a second time. (The first was on our own). The central location, friendly efficient service, free parking and swimming pool all at great value is what brought us back.

The room was excellent with the travel cot for our 1 year old all set up when we arrived. The only real complaint we had was it being next to the road and the corresponding noise. For that reason we had to leave the window closed and the room got very hot which made for a bit of a restless night. In future I'd ask for a non roadside room (like we had the first time). 

But we dusted off the cobwebs with a nice swim in the pool the next morning. That was after a excellent breakfast (they didn't even charge our 1 and 3 year old which was a nice touch). 

One other small gripe. We were going to the Dublin Convention Centre and the webiste says a 20 or 25 minute walk. The lady at reception told us the same. It took closer to an hour. Still, the location to shops, bars, restaurants can't be beat.

I wouldn't hesitate in returning or recommending this place. It's now our ""go to"" hotel in Dublin.",4,2013,08,29
248,Excellent,Stayed as a family of 2 adults and 2 children in room 400. Had emailed ahead and asked for a refurbished room and was very pleased that this was accommodated. Also that the extra bed was a proper single bed and not a camp bed. Room quite warm but left our fan on. Didn't find the noise from the street an issue. Free car parking very good. Staff were lovely and very accommodating. Very nice pool sauna etc. 10/15 mins walk to st stephens green and grafton street. All in all lovely hotel and would def return.,4,2013,08,28
248,Average,"There are many things I liked and didn't like about this hotel. 

We landed in Dublin from the USA at 5:30am. We figured they wouldn't have a room, but they did get us one by 11am. We were truly thankful for that. 

They don't have A/C. Which I had found out from Tripadvisor beforehand. However I called and they said we have plenty of fans and it shouldn't be a problem. It really was. We were blessed with nice weather in Dublin. It only rained 1 day. So, when you came back to your room after it was 75 degrees outside it hit you like a ton of bricks. The hallways were the worst. I feel really bad for the staff. I understand Dublin is normally very cool, but still it was bad. 

Also, we WANTED to leave our fan on in our room while we were out to keep it cool. The maid turned it off and shut our window everyday. That drove me nuts. I get wanting to save electricity, but you don't have A/C in the hotel. How much is your electric bill really? 

We never tried the restaurant in the lobby. It seemed pricey for pretty standard food. 

The location wasn't bad. We were close to St. Stephens Green, and about a 15 minute walk to Grafton street. 

Lastly, the room is very outdated. It is wooden bed. Everything it 80's wood style. I think for the price it should have been a little more updated. Also, they checked bags, and I felt they were safe. 

Staff was great. I really did enjoy them!",3,2013,08,27
248,Perfect Hotel In The Heart Of The Action,"I have stayed in the Camden Court approximately 60 times over the last 7 or 8 years mainly for going to gigs and sometimes for business. I don't stay anywhere else if I can help it. My father is the same having spent on average of 2 nights a week there for a few years whilst on business in Dublin. 

For me, it embodies everything a hotel should be - central, modern, friendly, clean and reliable.

The rooms (especially the renovated ones) are comfortable and decorated nicely. Each room has a flat screen TV with a decent amount of channels. 

The bathrooms are basic white tiles and fittings but this doesn't matter because the shower comes with one of the most important hotel features (for me at least) a shower with excellent pressure. 

The staff on the front desk and the bartenders are all very welcoming. 

I've had breakfast in the hotel a couple of times - standard fayre but it is cooked and presented well. 

Located on the top of Wexford St it is ideally positioned to discover Dublin city. Furthermore there are some great places on Wexford Steet to enjoy - ""Against The Grain"" is a nice little craft beer bar. ""Whelans"" and ""Anseo"" are known for being laid back with decent music. ""Cassidy's"" is great for a pint of Arthur's best and watching the football. There are several chip shops which do nothing to help my waistline but what can I do? It'd be rude not to sample it.  

Finally and one of the things that keeps me coming back to The Camden Court time after time is the availability of parking. Not only is it FREE but it is also secure. 

I have booked to stay here twice in the next two months and will continure to do so for both business and pleasure.",5,2013,08,27
248,Excellent,"Stayed here on business before and really enjoyed it. This time we went as a family (kids 8 & 9) on a voucher deal.
I didn’t expect such a good experience since we’ve had disappointments with other hotels using vouchers.
We were not treated any differently to any of the other guests. On arrival we were greeted by friendly and professional staff at reception who engaged in conversation and answered all our questions. Our room had three proper beds and was very clean and spacious.
We checked in at 6pm and rushed down to the pool which allows kids to swim up to 7pm. The leisure centre was very clean and the staff here were very friendly here as well.
Next morning we had a great breakfast, the choice of food which was all fresh and well-presented meant that even our picky eaters couldn't complain.
We left our car in the secure car park at the hotel and used the tram system to get about. There is a tram stop just around the corner.
Overall this was an excellent experience in a good location and I will definitely be back. THANKS.",5,2013,08,25
248,Slightly disappointing,"I was a bit surprised by the many excellent ratings on tripadvisor.  In my opinion this is much overrated :
- Rooms definitely need refurbishment.  Both the room and the bathroom give an outdated impression, e.g. joints between tiles that have deteriorated or have disappeared
- while we were in Dublin, outside temperature never rose above 20°C, however in the room it was definitely above 25°C.  There is no airco, and leaving the window open for an entire day didn't solve the problem. I was in Italy last month, while it was above 35°C, and my room was cooler over there than in cloudy Dublin ; not really what you expect.
- Beds are uncomfortable : it is like sleeping on a wooden board.  I normally like sleeping on somewhat harder mattress but they shouldn't exagerate
- Breakfast is disappointing.  It may be OK if you are very fond of the typical Irish breakfast.  Personally I love some sweet stuff in the morning, but in that respect the buffet is really poor.  What is particularly disappointing is when you find a sign above the toaster that says that you shouldn't put any croissants in it, while you cannot find any croissant in the entire breakfast room (you probably need to bring them yourself).

Positive element is the friendliness of the staff and their willingness to help whenever possible.",3,2013,08,24
248,Disappointing,"Stayed here for 3 nights, beds uncomfortable & breakfast very disappointing. Food overcooked, juice watered down & breads unappetising. On the plus side good location & has leisure facilities. Will not be back!",2,2013,08,23
248,Overall very good - excellent service - would stay here again,"This hotel is centrally located, clean, well maintained, very reasonably priced and the staff were excellent. Our flight arrived in Dublin super early and we had to figure out something to do until our rooms became available. We arrived tired from the flight and a little flustered since our planned mode of transportation (city busses - were on strike that weekend) didn't work out. The hotel had a closet where we could safely store our luggage, and allowed us to use the workout facilities to shower and get changed. One of our rooms was ready at 11am so we were able to check in super early (given that regular check in is 2pm, that is extremely accomodating). We needed taxis and the staff helped us to order them. They also provided us with help finding places to eat and recommending things to do/see. The room was fine - no AC but the room temperature was fine with the windows open. Also, we ran the Dublin Rock and Roll Half Marathon (that for some reason starts much later than every other half we've ever done) so we needed to check out a little late which was fine. The only glitch, and the reason for my 4 (not 5) stars, is that the wake up call was not what we were expecting - someone came into our room (actually our kids room) to wake us up. Next time, we'll skip the wake up call and make sure they know to never enter the room while we're there. Overall, the experience was good and we'd stay there again.",4,2013,08,22
248,Great place to stay in Dublin,"This hotel is top notch.  From the assistance with luggage to the restaurant.  We had nothing but fantastic service and great accommodations.  We had a room overlooking the court yard where the buses and cars pulled in for check in.  That was the only downside since the rooms in Dublin don't have AC and there was a heat wave while we were there.  They had fans to use but with the windows open, we could hear voices below late into the evening.  Other than that, all was great.  Good walking distance to convenience shops and pubs.",5,2013,08,21
248,Sixth time and never again,"Stayed here saturday 17th - we were givem room 518. The room was dirty, thick black marks on the walls. A tiny room with very worn looking furniture. We informed reception who told us no other room was available. After a couple of minutes we were offered room 519 which was not much better. One socket in the whole room. Again worn furniture and a distinct smell of stale smoke in the bathroom. It was supposed to be a non smoking room.
When we asked for a taxi to grafton street we were told without any phone call being made that there was long delays and that we should get the luas instead as it was quicker and cheaper.
breakfast 20 euro charge you must be joking. Never again. Total disaster. This hotel has fallen into serious decline",1,2013,08,20
248,Heart of Dublin,"A hotel situated 10 minutes away from the major pedestrian sones and beautiful parks.
The  restaurants and bars serve good food and drink. The reception polite, friendly and effective. The rooms are spacious and well appointed. Will definitely return.",4,2013,08,19
248,A Good Couple of Nights' Sleep!,"This centrally-located hotel took a bit of finding without a sat-nav, thanks to the city's one-way system. We were extremely grateful to be able to park my car securely and forget about it for 48 hours, as the heart of the city is just a walk away. Although possibly not in the grandest part of town, the area felt safe at night and the staff were welcoming and helpful. Our twin room, to the rear, overlooking the small outside car park (there is further parking available), was simple, but clean and adequate, with comfortable beds and everything worked well in the bathroom, too. Importantly, it fulfilled my request for a 'quiet room' and we got two very good nights' sleep. With numerous shops and cafes just seconds from the front door and a kettle in the room, we didn't feel the need to order an expensive breakfast. Neither did we try the restaurant for dinner, although the setting, menu and prices looked quite promising. We did make use of the pool, sauna and steam room, which was attractive, although, like so many hotel pools, its narrowness meant it felt crowded with more than four or five swimmers. The floor-tiles to the changing area were a little slippery and could be a potential safety-hazard. All in all, this felt like a good find in a lovely city.",5,2013,08,18
248,Awesome stay,"This hotel was super in every way.   Large lobby, great for informal gathering (I was here for a family reunion), or for just sitting.  Buffet breakfast had a lot of variety and great food.  The rooms were clean and comfy.   The attached restaurant/bar had really good food - we ate there for 3 evenings of our stay.   
All in all, a really good experience, really nice hotel.",5,2013,08,18
248,Great hotel,I stayed in this hotel the weekend of the rock and roll half marathon wit my mom and two brothers.  Absolutely delighted wit every aspect of the hotel.  Reception staff very friendly and efficient.  Free parking in the hotel which is a huge bonus for Dublin.  We couldn't arrange a late check out as they were full up but were allowed use the fitness centre facilities after the marathon which was just fantastic.  Had a couple of drinks in the bar the night before and it was lovely and relaxing.  Breakfast was fab although we couldn't eat as much as we would have liked because of the run!  Anyway I will definately be staying in this hotel again and would highly recommend it as would the rest of my family :-).  Great location close to great restaurants and pubs.,5,2013,08,16
248,"Great location and great hotel, very friendly staff","stayed in family room with my wife and two children, room 506. Basic enough room. the cover of the socket in the corner was broken. had to put the bedside locker in front of it to stop my daughter putting her finger in! Very Dangerous!! 
The cot that was brought to our room was flimsy, wouldn't stay up straight! and also no mattress, just a hard bottom which wouldn't be comfortable for anybody!
Food was perfect, we ate in the bar. staff were great, very quick and friendly. Hotel lobby and bar were spotless. 
Used the swimming pool and steam room. 
Overall we were happy with the hotel and the service. (FIX THE SOCKET IN THE ROOM!)
Would be happy to recommend to anybody. Great location, 10 mins walk to the shops and free parking!",4,2013,08,13
248,Camden court hotel,"This hotel is conveniently located to the main shopping area in Dublin.  It was very easy to get taxis just outside the entrance.  The hotel itself is very comfortable, clean and excellent staff to assist with every query.  The leisure facilities were just perfect with an adequate size pool and gym.  Everything you need for stay in Dublin.  We booked this hotel as we were visiting the RDs Horse Show as our usual closer hotel was fully booked however we will be booking this Hotel for our annual visit next year! Well done Camden Court Hotel!",5,2013,08,12
248,Easy transport links nice hotel,"Easy links to get around, nice bar and good for kids only fault was additional cost of leisure facilities otherwise good venue good location. Easy to access from airport bus takes you within half mile lose to St Stephens so good pay area in park for kids.",4,2013,08,11
248,Good city centre hotel with very friendly staff - not the cheapest though,"Free parking. Check in very quick. Stayed in 541 which was a nice quiet end of corridor rear facing room. Room was clean and comfortable with a king sized bed (two singles pushed together) which meant not sleeping on the joining. 

Breakfast was average although there was a good variety. The mushrooms were terrible and fried eggs slightly underdone.

Breakfast times are sharp with the end time of 10.30 weekdays strictly adhered to. By 10.31 all foods were gone from hotplate. That said the staff came to our table to advise that the food was finishing in case we wanted anything else.

Checkout was fast also and the staff asked how our stay was and seemed genuinely interested.

Would I go again? Yes although @ €135 b&b for 2 midweek it was a bit on the dear side.

We did not use the spa so can't comment but the pictures of it look fab.

I have to repeat about the staff. Everyone we met was helpful and courteous. 10 out 10 for that.",4,2013,08,10
248,"""Wonderful Stay""","Beautiful hotel, great rooms, wonderful food, relaxing bar!  The staff was awesome--a friend of mine had lost one of her bags at the airport bus ticket window and by some miracle the airport managed to contact the hotel and notify them.  As we checked in, the desk clerk informed us that the bag was found, he called a cab for my friend and she retrieved the bag.  What are the odds?  We would stay here again in a heart beat!",5,2013,08,10
248,Good close location,"We stopped for two nights here with our tour group. Handy location with 10-15 minutes walk into the main strip. Rooms are spacious, clean and good comfortable beds. Buffet breakfasts are very nice with a big range of food. You have a cook serving you the hot food and cooking at the same time which makes the food fresh and hot. Free wi-fi was a bonus and also a great Irish pub next door called The Bleeding Horse.",4,2013,08,10
248,Fab stay at the Camden Court!,"Great location, spotlessly clean, bright tastefully decorated rooms, great comfy beds, very accommodating staff, delicious food (even at 5am)....what more can I say?! Would defintiely recommend this great all-rounder hotel which doesn't break the bank. We had a fabulous stay and have already booked it again for our next Dublin trip!  :)",5,2013,08,08
248,Great Location,"Chose this hotel because of its proximity to St Stephen's Green as we were there to do the Rock & Roll Dublin Half Marathon which started and finished at this location.

Literally just 5 minutes walk away from Grafton Street as well so very central to many of the main attractions. Good size bedrooms, although very warm during the night, has the added bonus of a small pool, jacuzzi, sauna and full size gym, so overall a good hotel to base yourself in for your visit to Dublin.",4,2013,08,07
248,Camden Court Hotel was very nice and convenient,"We spent two nights at the Camden Court Hotel. We had the refurbished room in the back part of the Hotel as suggested by another review of this Hotel. The room was clean, nicely decorated, and quiet except for the sea gull who serenaded us each morning. We recommend it and the location is within walking distance of many places of interest and the Hop-on-hop-off bus.",5,2013,08,06
248,An excellent Conference venue!,"We recently held our 4th conference at the Camden Court Hotel and were once again so pleased on every level! The Meeting Excellence team truly deliver as the name implies. From the event management/liasion for the planning of the event and set up on the day to the staff members on hand to ensure that all our needs are met with a smile; I highly recommend the Camden for any conference/meeting/celebration or training weekend. 
Dining is a pleasure and the menus available cater to all diet preferences. Our delegates were delighted with the lunch service being delicious, quick and friendly during our breaks. 
A big thank you to Sandra Egan who leads the conference team with absolute expertise, we always know our events are in good hands with Sandra and her staff. 
Bedrooms are comfortable and homey for a great night sleep and breakfast service is excellent. 
Stay at the Camden for an oasis in the heart of Dubln city whether on holidays or for business. You will not be disappointed!",5,2013,08,05
248,All positive.,"Camden court is a city centre hotel with a secure underground car park and is round the corner from the Harcourt stop on the Green tram line. 2 stops to city ctr. 

Travelled Summer 2013 with a party of four.

Rooms were excellent (a double and a twin in our case) and are clean and modern. We were there during the recent heatwave and each room had a fan to keep us cool. Ask at reception if you need one. 

The pool and spa area are very good with friendly staff. If you're not Irish yourself and are unused to wearing a compulsory swim cap don't let it put you off using the pool because everyone looks daft and after 5 minutes you forget all about that and enjoy the largish pool. 

There is a good bar, which we used a couple of times, and a nice looking restaurant, which we didn't use for evening meals.  Staff were very helpful.  Breakfast is the usual price range for a hotel of this standard (about £13). We ate b/fast only on the last morning of our stay prior to a long drive to co.Cork.  Food was good and portions plentiful. Standard buffet selections so fill your boots. 

Reception, bar and dining staff were all exceptionally friendly, polite and helpful. A credit to the Camden Court. 
Mr night porter could have cracked a smile when opening the door just after midnight though. We were perfectly sober and polite but he merely unlocked the door, locked it again and walked away. 

Free wi-fi.

A great choice and perfect for our stay. Highly recommended.",4,2013,08,05
248,Lovely break away,"We had a lovely time at the Camden, clean hotel and friendly staff. Spa facilities were great and we had a delicious meal on our last night, I would definitely recommend the monkfish. It was so good we stayed another night (unplanned). We would have liked a bit of discount for the fact we were staying in the same room and had been there 2 nights already but we had to pay full price for the extra evening which was about the same price as the 2 night deal we had paid for. 
Close to Grafton Street.
Would return.",5,2013,07,31
248,Pleasant hotel - good bar prices,"I stayed one night here with my wife - (it's actually not too far away from where we live.
Comfy hotel - excellent staff - I really couldn't fault anything about this hotel. We got the room for a reasonable price and it's a 10-15 minute walk into the city centre. Plenty of pubs/restaurants/cafes in the vicinity too. Didn't eat there - but would have liked to.

Thanks",5,2013,07,30
248,Uncomfortable sleep,"One reviewer summed up this property with a perfect description: 4 star lobby with 2 star rooms.  The lobby: large, comfortable, tastefully decorated.  The front desk staff: always pleasant & helpful. The bar: nice and the bartender made a good Long Island Iced Tea. Morning buffet breakfast: good selection of items, staff prompt with coming around for coffee refills.  Location to Grafton Street & other attractions: convenient.

The rooms....ahhhhh....what do say here?  Very basic, the professional pictures posted looked nothing at all like our 2 twin bed room.  Contributor photos more accurate.  We stayed here 2 nights at the beginning of our trip & 2 nights at the end.  The beds the first 2 nights while not great were fine.  The last two nights the mattresses were so old & saggy.  

Duvets were on the bed upon arrival.  I prefer a top sheet, which I know were laundered after each guest - duvets, more than likely, are not.  None on bed so we put in a call for them & they were promptly delivered.  The next morning when the beds were to be made my top sheet was balled up on the bed with the duvet placed over it.  My companion's bed has the duvet placed in the closet, the top sheet somewhat straightened & a blanket previously not in the room was now on the bed.  Odd housekeeping.  I also noticed housekeeping was not as pleasant as other staff members.  Each morning as I passed I would greet them but only one ever returned the reply.  Possibly overworked with the summer rush but still.  

Here is my biggest complaint with this hotel - the noise!!!!  Both times our room faced the courtyard.  The first night we were exhausted from flying throughout the night night to arrive here, we hoped for a good night's sleep.  Not to be had!  There was a group congregating in the courtyard laughing & talking until midnight.  There were a number of tables set up out there for smokers, which people had settled into for a couple of hours. Near midnight I called the front desk asking if staff could tell those guests that it is quite late & most likely they weren't remembering that guests' windows are right above that area.  The staff member said it will probably get a bit quieter in about 10 mintues, which was the case. 

The stay at the end of the trip I noticed a lesser number of tables outside, which gave hope.  We were on the 2nd floor directly over the tables (room 225).  After midnight again people could be heard, then at 3:00 a.m. a couple were talking for quite a while as if it were 3 in the afternoon. It sounded as if they are right in our room!  Some members of our tour group had a 6:30 a.m. airport departure so the bus back up signal could be heard as it reversed in to pick them up, then guests saying their goodbyes.  This was after another group left earlier in that a.m.  You get the idea...don't plan to sleep if you face that courtyard.  I put a suggestion on my hotel card noting they should post a sign asking guests to show consideration in noise level between the hours of 10:00 or 11:00 p.m. - 7:00 a.m.  

Unless I could be promised a room that did not face the courtyard, I personally would not rebook this hotel.",3,2013,07,30
248,First night of many,"We stayed at Camden court as the first night of a month long holiday.
The reception staff were very helpful checking us in after a 28 hour journey.
The hotel is very clean with excellent rooms and comfortable beds.
Ver centrally located in Dublin.
Gym and pool a bonus.
Free onside parking provided.",5,2013,07,30
248,Great place to stay,"My room was all I expected, spacious, clean and with view out the back of the hotel (quiet) as I had requested. Staff were always very helpful, and I love that this hotel has a swimming pool, jacuzzi and steam room. I used the Camden Court as a base to explore Dublin's surrounding area, and go for day trips. As I had a hire car, the free parking came in handy. Breakfast was not included in my rate, and the location of the hotel means there are a number of great breakfast places down the road, as well as a number of supermarkets for anything else you might need.
Definitely will stay there again.",5,2013,07,29
248,Mixed experience but overall positive,"This hotel falls into what I would describe as ""4 star downstairs, 2 star upstairs."" The lobby and facilities are gorgeous. However our room was about as basic as possible. Beds were hard and uncomfortable and unfortunately for us, we hit Dublin during a heatwave so the rooms were hotter than I thought was even possible. Our first room on the 2nd floor didn't have a window that opened all the way. I believe it was due to the location and the possibility of someone breaking in. That particular room was musty, smelled of stale cigarettes, had burn holes in the curtains and you could see the butts beneath the window. We moved to another room on the 2nd floor that was more pleasant. We asked for a fan the 1st night but they were all taken. We were able to get one for the 2nd & 3rd nights and it made a world of difference. 

Some good things: Location - close to everything and the kebab shop nearest was the best I'v ever had! Service - everyone we dealt with at the front desk was SUPER friendly and nice. TV - had lots of channels. Pool looked amazing but we didn't fit it into our schedule. I believe you are required to wear a swim cap so maybe bring one if you want to save a few euro. 

Overall I would return again. It wasn't as posh as I normally like, but it did the job.",4,2013,07,28
248,excellent staff,great location with bonus of a carpark.15 mins walk down one road to temple bar.then another 10 mins to oconnel st.handy for bus tour of city.hotel very clean and tidy staff very helpful was a fridge at reception which was great for us with a child with an eating dissorder we could store things there.nice swimming pool kids could use up to 7 o clock we will be going back,5,2013,07,26
248,Great location,We stayed at Camden Court on 2 separate occasions in July 2013 during our first visit to Ireland. Perfect location to tour and discover Dublin. Breakfast was good to enjoy before a busy day out touring. We found the staff very helpful! ,5,2013,07,25
248,I recommend this hotel,"This hotel is awesome.  You have everything you need inside and utside the hotel.  Very good location, breakfast and services.  The swimming pool and jacuzzi is wonderful for relaxing. People are helpful and friendly.",5,2013,07,25
248,Steadfastly Reliable.,"Every year we come to Dublin to perform at the Ivy Gardens Comedy Festival, a great event, we stay in the Camden Court Hotel. Without fail they provide us with a fantastic stay! From the extremely fast and friendly check in, to the equally quick and courteous check out, it is a joy to spend time here. The staff are friendly and helpful, and always have a smile on their faces. Breakfast is great, either the full Irish or the continental. The bar is open till 3 in the morning. I'm already looking forward to next year.",5,2013,07,25
248,Very good value for money,"We stayed for 2 nights in the hotel (Tuesday, Wednesday) visiting Dublin. The hotel' s location was very convenient to all attractions in the city centre (5 min walk to Stephen' s green park, 10' to Trinity college and 15' to Temple bar area) and just a minute walk to a bus lane to-from the airport (bus No 16, cost 2.80 E). Polite staff, computer area (but bit slow connection and with a charge). Spacious room, comfortable bed, big bathroom. The only flaws - no air-condition and a little noisy (but then again the whole Dublin is noisy). There is an extra charge for breakfast but there are plenty of coffee shops that offer great breakfast for a reasonable price, especially around Trinity college.",4,2013,07,25
248,A mixed experience,"I stayed here recently when the weather in Dublin was very warm. Alas the hotel does not offer air conditioning and the room I had, and throughout the hotel, was like a furnace. 
That created a very miserable night of no sleep. 
The hotel itself is very nice and clean and staff were helpful anf friendly. 
Location is good but quite a long walk from the bus depot etc.",3,2013,07,25
248,I would go back....,"We stayed here our last night in Dublin last week.  This is located in a busy area of shops, bars and restaurants.  I liked the lobby and the bar.  The rooms were very clean but small and no air conditioning.  We were on the 3rd floor facing the main street which meant we had a very noisy night and morning.  Tip: Ask for a room off the main street and a fan.",4,2013,07,23
248,Family Reunion,We booked our family reunion here as many members travelled from overseas. It is a perfect central location. The Meeting Excellence team were really helpful through the whole process. The room was great (air conditioned ...wonderful after a hot summers day). The buffet was tasty with plenty for all (thanks Sandra for helping me get quantities right). No problem moving times nothing was to much trouble for the team on duty. We had a great night. I would like mention Julie who kept the drinks flowing and dealing with any little queries or changes we had on the night....she is a star. So thank you Camden court from the 3 Susan's.,5,2013,07,22
248,Great Stay,"Fantastic hotel, I've stayed in many a four star that don't match up to the Camden Court, Reception staff were so helpful, early check-in late check-out, no problem.
All the staff were very friendly and that's what makes a good hotel.",5,2013,07,22
248,A great alternative to staying in the city centre,This is a very good hotel at a good price. THERE IS FREE PARKING - WHICH WILL COST YOU AT LEAST €20 IN TOWN. The reception was very welcoming and the departure equally so. The room was very good and quiet. The only down-side was that there was no air conditioning in the bedrooms.,4,2013,07,21
248,A comfy stay with excellent service,"This hotel is a real find. It's slightly out of the town centre but that means you can get a good deal. Reception is large, stylish and decked out with opulent leathers. The bar is bright and bustling. And both are staffed by excellent and interested people.

Our room was large (but fractionally dark), the bed was exceptionally comfy and it had a great walk in shower (ideal for mobility impaired guests). 

The only slight gripe was that we were told that we had to wear a shower cap in order to use the swimming pool (local by-law apparently). And shower caps cost 2.50 euro each.

But other than that, we had an excellent stay and would definitely recommend a stay here.",4,2013,07,21
248,uncomfortable NO Air Conditioning,"I know its Ireland but you would have thought you were in Africa, the heat was unbearable. Poor lighting for doing makeup. Other than than a great spot, breakfast was good, hotel comfortable, Staff helpful. would stay again especially if I was going to O2 to see the Georgeous MICHAEL BUBLE. He scored 5 haha +++++Ps go in the winter they had a 5' radiator in the room haha",4,2013,07,21
248,Loved our stay,"Really lovely hotel, staff are so friendly the young girl that checked us in couldn't do enough for us, it's so central, free parking the room was nice really comfy bed and the pool is really nice, even the guy working on pool reception was lovely, can't wait to go back, ",5,2013,07,21
248,Great central location,"Stayed here for Hen party and could not have had a better time. Hotel was very well kept, our rooms were clean, modern and comfortable.
Dinner we had on our second night was fab and we got a private area off the restaurant so we weren't disturbing any other diners.
Breakfast was great, all the usual bits you expect.
Staff were really great, so friendly, dining staff in particular were so helpful to us.
Hotel is right beside a great pub and literally across the road from the Luas which is 1 stop from Stephen's green....fantastic location.
Can't wait to go back for another stay.",4,2013,07,19
248,Good stay,"Good Stay.Good Hotel,was at concert in Iveagh Gardens and hotel is in great location .Food was excellent and staff very nice and friendly.Leisure Centre was very clean and modern.There was a lovely bar next door to the hotel called The Bleeding Horse which was a great little bar with great atmosphere.",4,2013,07,18
248,Camden Court,"The hotel and staff were very good. Our flight got in really early and staff found a room for us anyway which we were grateful for. Beds reasonably good. Breakfast was good. In 6 hotel stays this was the only hotel we got actually free, reliable WiFi. A big plus. The big downside for us, especially my husband was the noise from the street our room faced. Lots of traffic noise during day but the biggest problem was the noise at night with all the roaring boys, roisterers out yelling back and forth to each other all night long every night. We had to have the window open to get any air as there is no air conditioning. Hubs was just not comfortable and couldn't sleep here. This was his second worst hotel of our vacation.",3,2013,07,17
248,Good vale for money!,"Just returned form an overnight stay at the Camden court hotel with my husband and a group of friends. We could not fault a thing! Reasonably priced for Dublin. Good value for money. We did not eat in restaurant so I can't comment on food. Breakfast was extra and seemed slightly overpriced at €13 pp. We ate at a local cafe called Gerry's, great food and service and half the price!!",4,2013,07,15
248,Pleasant Stay at Camden Court Hotel,"A four night stay at this hotel was included as part of a Road Scholar ""Best of Ireland"" tour.  Although not in the middle of Dublin. we found the hotel conveniently located within a good walking distances of most sites (Trinity College, Dublin castle, cathedrals, the various museums and entertainment venues, parks, and the river).  The rooms and facilities, including a very nice indoor swimming pool, were quite comfortable and their buffet-style breakfastes (included in our tour package) were very good with lots of options.",3,2013,07,11
248,Luxurious,I recently stayed here as part of a hen party and I was impressed with the rooms. Very comfortable beds with mattress toppers and marble sink in the bathroom. Lots of lovely products for the shower as well. The staff were very friendly and straightforward when asked any question.,5,2013,07,11
248,could have got better for our money,"We stayed here 3rd and 4th July and were very dissapointed with this hotel. Our room was very small and stuffy,and certainly could have done with an up date. The cheap net curtains needed a good wash and had holes in them.  Our room overlooked a car park and because it was stuffy we had to leave the window open. Deliveries seem to come to the car park at night so it was very noisey. We paid £198 for 2 nights WITHOUT  breakfast and we know we could have got much much better in Dublin. We wouldn,t stay here again. Also, on our first morning we had no electricity. I phoned reception and was asked ""really""? It came on about 35mins later. No explanation or apology. NOT GOOD SERVICE!!!!!!!",2,2013,07,05
248,Comfortable and Welcoming,"We stayed here for 4 nights in the beginning of July 2013.  We were impressed with the room and staff.  Everything was clean and well maintained.  We felt that the price (even though we were part of a tour) was excellent and would pick the hotel on our own.  Fortunately, there are two bus stops only meters from the hotel which serve the central city with multiple buses.  However, St. Georges Park and Trinity University, as well as, the two major cathedrals are within relatively easy walking distance.

On the slightly negative side was:
   .  the rooms were too warm; at least we could open the window because we were on the back side of the hotel.  Having a sheet instead of a comforter would have helped; we got one, but had to ask on two separate nights.
   .  the hotel is at least one km from the city center if one is not into walking.
   ,.  the dining room servers need some training in how to serve and clear the tables.  They definitely did not measure up to service we had elsewhere.",4,2013,07,05
248,First city trip to Dublin,"The hotel was picked by the tour group, but I can honestly say, that it is a very nice hotel. Good quality rooms and bathrooms. There was also a very helpful staff.
The hotel isn't located too far from anything and also has a bus stop just a few metres away. 

There's lots to do in Dublin, during the day as well as during the evening/night.

Overall a very good first impression.",4,2013,07,01
248,"Busy,busy,busy","Stayed at the Hotel from 28th to 30th June 2013.  Very large and busy hotel.  Rooms quite small but very comfortable with nice bathroom and 6 ft bed.    The lighting in the room wasn't very good for applying make-up.  We didn't have a very nice view, just the car park and a building opposite.  Friends staying on the road side said it was noisy if they didn't shut the window.  The whole hotel seemed very warm all the time.  There was a leisure centre attached but we didn't use it.  Breakfast on the first morning was excellent but on the second morning no quite so good although there was a very large choice of hot and cold food.  The staff were friendly and helpful.  Location was good with about a 10 minute walk into the centre, but some of the surrounding streets were a bit dingy.",4,2013,07,01
248,Very Pleasant Stay,"I had a pleasant stay at Camden Court Hotel recently. 

The hotel was very clean, well kept and the Receptionist was very polite. Our room was very spacious - it was decorated in a modern style and was clean and bright. The beds were extremely comfortable and blankets and pillows soft. 

The breakfast each morning was delicious - a range of cereals, cold fruit and meats, and a hot food was on offer such as bacon, black pudding and sausages. There were plenty of tables and so you virtually had no queue each morning at the busiest times.

The hotel was about a 5 minute walk to St Stephens Green and Grafton Street. It is a pleasant walk - the area is quite quiet with minimal traffic. 

Check in (and out) was very prompt. There was space to storage your luggage free of charge if you had a later journey home. There was also free wifi access which was very generous and well used! We also visited the hotel bar and had a pleasant drink in a quiet environment.

I have taken one star off this otherwise fantastic hotel as our room was located at the side of the hotel onto a street that appeared noisier during the night time than during the day. We were situated on the fourth floor but despite our windows being closed shut we were awakened a few times each night for both nights we stayed.",4,2013,06,30
248,Camden Court Booked By Travel Agent,"Our travel agent booked us in to the Camden Court for the first leg of our vacation in Ireland. We were on a budget so I was expecting way less than what we received. It was a lovely older hotel. Clean and comfortable. We were fortunate to have rooms that were off of a glass windowed hallway. (ask for one of these). The view wasn't spectacular but it was interesting. Some of the other hallways looked a little darker and less inviting.
The bed was comfortable and the bathroom was clean. The breakfast was outstanding and comes with the price of the room. I recommend getting downstairs to the restaurant no later than 7:00am as the place is packed and its a little harder to find a table. The pub next door, ""The Bleeding Horse"" is a good place to have a quiet drink in the evening. We enjoyed sitting outside at the tables on the street. We spent one evening in the spa area. (It looks like they have great exercise equipment in one room) The pool and hot tub area was very clean. There is a shallow pool for children as well.(They make you wear a swim cap)The sauna was very hot with water provided to ladle onto the hot rocks.The hotel is within an easy walking distance from St. Stephens green. At St Stephens Green you can utilize the hop on hop off busses which is a great way to see the city.(Stop #7) If you don't have pre-paid vouchers for the hop on hop off bus, you'll need to purchase the tours at the Tourism office on upper O'Connell Street. Ask at the person at the Hotel desk about how to get there on the city busses that stop near the hotel.  Hertz rent a car is within walking distance from the Hotel although it was still a nightmare trying to get out of the city. I would go back to the Camden Court if we return to Dublin",4,2013,06,29
248,Great hotel for access to Dublin - Business or Pleasure.,"Recently had quite a few stays at the Camden for Business purposes and find it is a good hotel to be in, would recommend a high floor room away from the lifts and on the back.  
Restaurant is very good have daily specials on and and also do a very good breakfast with full continental and hot options.
The bar is good as well and there is a limited but good menu available as well.
THe hotel is well placed for getting into and around Dublin.
I am very impress with the Health faciliites there is a fully equiped Gym and Pool facilies that are on a par with only I know a good 16mtr swimming pool, sauna, steam room and jacuzzi.
Really is a good place to make your base whilst in Dublin.",4,2013,06,27
248,"Business trip, great location an nice hotel","Good hotel, nice friendly feel. Can get busy so book in advance.
Easy to get to Grafton Street well within walking distance.
Nice gym with helpful staff as well as a swimming pool.
Breakfast is very good with a lot of choice and never an issue to request something special not on the menu.",5,2013,06,25
248,Well worth the stay...,We had a great weekend all staff food and service was exceptional! our night got even better when we returned back to the Camden court bar i must say i've never felt so at home like i did when i returned later that night the bar man Darren made us coffees and teas at 3.30 he really knew how to look after us something you don't get to often thanks again darren for the fun and craic we had that night we will definately be seeing you again from all the doire hen girls,4,2013,06,24
248,good stop,"a 2 night stop here on my tour of ireland very clean good comfy rooms great food in resturant,staff helpfull,a 15 minute walk to most areas in the centreneven on walking stick  ,a great hotel grea city and great guiness",5,2013,06,24
248,Nice hotel n Dublin,"Stayed for one night with my sister. Arrived on Saturday early. My sister asked for a refurbished room as she had read they were nicer. The receptionist said that if we required a refurbished room that we would have to wait so we left our suitcase and went out for a look round Dublin. 

When we went to our room it was very nice, there was a double and single bed with tea making facilities, a lovely clean bathroom with toiletries. There was also free wifi in the hotel. We went down to use the leisure facilities and they were very good. There was a steam room, sauna, swimming pool and jacuzzi. The hotel provides free towels. 

The bedrooms were a little warm and as other guests have said the windows only open a little but as we found out the next morning there are fans available.

We went in for breakfast and it was very substantial. There were cereals, full fat milk and low fat milk. There were 2 toasters with a range of breads including brown, white, croissants and soda bread. There were lots of different continental foods including meats, smoked salmon, fruit and cheeses. Full Irish breakfast was a available including bacon, sausage, hash browns, mushrooms, black and white pudding, beans and eggs. Tea and coffee was brought to your table.  There were also juices available. 

All in all the hotel was very clean and the receptionists were very informative. Would definitely recommend this hotel.",4,2013,06,23
248,Very nice hotel,"My husband and I were on a pilgrimage to Ireland and Catholic Travel booked our group into the Camden Court. It was very nice. It's a rather large hotel. Lobby was nice and big. The continental breakfast was fantastic - plenty of choices and plenty of room to sit, eat and visit. Wait staff was constantly going around making sure we had plenty of coffee / tea and kitchen staff kept the buffet well stocked. Our room was great - after a long flight, there's nothing like a good sleep. The bed was comfortable, the bathroom was great - good sized and all was very clean. Actually, we stayed here twice - for two nights upon our arrival to Ireland and for two nights before our return flight home. Our rooms had no air conditioning, but none was needed as the temps were very nice so we opened our window. Since we were so dog tired upon our arrival, the street noise didn't bother us in the least, but we did have to shut the window on the return leg. My suggestion is that you request a room that is not street side if you are a light sleeper. If not - go for it! Great place to stay!!",4,2013,06,23
248,Great City Centre hotel,We stay in this hotel regularly and keep meaning to put in a review. It's a greatcity centre hotel whether you're a couple on a night out in town or staying over with the kids. Was abittiredandinneed ofan overhaul which theyare nowdoing. The rooms are much better now than a few years ago plus the bar and restaurant are hugely improved. If Icould criticise one thing it would be the service at breakfast time. They are terrible at simply cleaning up tables when people are finished or checking to see if you need anything when you first arrive. The staff seem to be very inexperienced. Overall though the best place to stay in the city centrein our view.,4,2013,06,23
248,"Great location, quiet hotel, helpful staff","We were so glad to find this hotel. It was a little farther away from temple bar and was quiet but very close to convenient places to eat as well as St. Stephens Green and Grafton street. The staff was very helpful with all our questions. The price of €99 was extremely reasonable and much lower than I expected for Dublin. The hotel was Very nice and our room was nice and comfortable, although a bit smaller than what I expected from the pictures. I probably viewed the wrong set of pictures when I booked. But nonetheless, we were very happy with our room and the hotel in general. Eat at the cafe down the street on Camden street…it was cheap, delicious, and where the locals eat before heading to work. ",4,2013,06,21
248,Convenient hotel,"Great location close to everything and comfortable. Staff were friendly and helpful. Will definitely return. Food was good, breakfast and dinner. Ideal hotel for short weekend breaks. very good value for money.",3,2013,06,21
248,Good except for breakfast frenzy,"We stayed here for 3 nights.  The location is great, we easily walked places.  There was good wifi access.  The hallways upstairs could use a reno, but the room was adequate.  It seemed fairly recently reno'd- no in-room safe though.  My only real complaint was the breakfast buffet.  It was a zoo, a long wait to get food and then there was not adequate seating, although some tables were reserved and thus empty.  Most mornings the staff did not seat us, so people seated themselves wherever they could, not making the best use of space (singles sitting at tables for 4 etc.) We sat with strangers one morning as they had no where else to sit.  I think they could have done a better job with helping people find seats, or they need a bigger restaurant or reservations at breakfast if they're going to offer a bed and breakfast deal.",4,2013,06,21
248,Exactly what I wanted,I was looking for a reasonably priced hotel with a good gym and pool with a central location. The Camden Court Hotel ticked all the boxes. The spa was great and the room was everything I expected. I would recommend this to anyone.,5,2013,06,20
248,Awesome experience.,"I was in Dublin for a break and the trip was fantastic. We had an awesome hospitality from Camden Court Hotel and considering the price for the facilities enjoyed by of the guest or at one's disposal, it is a deal. I'll definitely be going back for another treat and someone is gonna hear about the luxury.",5,2013,06,16
248,Lovely one night family stay,"Stayed here in this hotel for one night with husband and 2 kids. Room was very spacious, lovely and comfortable. Because we were sightseeing we didn't spend a lot of time in hotel but met our needs perfectly. Would highly recommend this hotel, location is central and car parking in hotel is great. Had breakfast in the morning and again met our needs perfectly and set us all up for the day! Hope to get back there again soon.",4,2013,06,15
248,Edge of the Action in Dublin,"The Camden Court is right on the edge of the action in Dublin.  You can walk anywhere in the Grafton St. - St. Stevens Square area in just a few minutes.  The National Gallery is nearby with the ""lost Caravaggio"" painting prominently on display. (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Taking_of_Christ_%28Caravaggio%29) The front desk staff at Camden Court went way above expectations in helping us in several areas - for their helpfulness alone I would stay at the hotel again.  We enjoyed our one breakfast there but we did have to wait for items to be refilled in the buffet and the wait staff seemed to be very tired that morning.  We enjoyed the lobby area and our room was comfortable and quiet - but big pluses in downtown Dublin.  My wife and I both enjoyed the Camden Court and recommend it.",4,2013,06,15
248,"Great location, Courteous staff","Again another hotel that needs a lifting on its bedrooms. Most of the main areas such as the lobby are not cleaned.  I had a very poor breakfast...not clean and the food,......well, unfortunately the Irish do not even know how to cook an egg.......Next time I want to go on a strict diet, I will spend a month in Ireland and I will lose all the weight I want.
I would recommend this hotel only for it's location, 10 minutes walk to Grafton street and most of the attractions such as Trinity, St Stephens etc",2,2013,06,10
248,"This was a ""real find""","This hotel is excellent- it is spotlessly  clean, close to city centre, quiet and  breakfast fantastic which sets you up for the day ahead.
Staff very helpful, and  nothing was too much trouble.
My husband and I have stayed in 4* hotels which have not been as good as this.",5,2013,06,09
248,"Great hotel, great location!","Stayed in this hotel as of a party of 3 people. It is a beautiful hotel, centrally located with very good food.
There is complimentary parking which is fantastic considering it is in the city centre. It is roughly a 10 minute walk to the top of Grafton Street....ideal location!
Stayed in a triple room which was very spacious. Absolutely spotlessly clean....well done to housekeeping! Beds were also so comfy...slept like a log!
All staff were very pleasant and helpful. Had dinner there on the evening of our arrival. Waitress was very friendly and food was beautiful. Very quick service also.
Breakfast buffet was also was very good. Plenty of freshly cooked food and was very tasty.
Did not use leisure centre as we did not have the time but looked very impressive.
Would highly recommend this hotel and will definitely stay there on my next trip to Dublin. Thanks Camden Court!",5,2013,06,07
248,Camden court dublin,"Have stayed here many times,very convient for Dublin City centre,10 minutes walk from Grafton street,museums,art galleries. .Free parking up to 1pm on day of departure.
Friendly and helpfull staff ,nice restraurant,rooms very good ,clean and bright.",4,2013,06,05
248,"Great location, good value, breakfast and a pool!","This place is just what we needed on a business and pleasure visit to Dublin. Good full breakfast, pool and fitness center, plus free Wifi.  Very comfortable room, helpful friendly staff. Couple of dud waiters in the bistro, but found a friendly waitress in the lobby for a late sandwich. Lots of interesting cheap eats nearby.",4,2013,06,04
248,could do better.,"This hotel is in a great location in good proximity to all the city sites for daytime & nighttime. The parking is secure and having a leisure centre is such a treat when  you have been out on h tiles and need to prepare youself for shopping the next day. Luas is a stones throw from here & bus stops are right outside for all links around town. Other reviews mention noise, the only noisebi heard came via the corridor which is standard in any hotel, apartment, house, etc. Bring earplugs if your that sensitive.Cons: I  Would have liked a better reception on arrival having stayed there before I remember thinking the same) as I was travelling by myself I still deserved the courtesy given to the two couples who checked in ahead of me, the blonde girl on reception seemed disinterested, other than to repeat your not having brekfast but if you do you'll have to pay.

248,Great value for money,Stayed here and its warm hospitality is very welcome. The breakfast served is quite nice and full. The rooms are very decent & maintained well. It is well connected to many areas in the city. Has some resturants nearby from India & Lebanon for folks who would like far east flavors.,5,2013,06,04
248,Excellent value,"I have stayed in this hotel many of times and I will stay here again, it's clean, staff are more than helpful and the location is so close to everything, can't praise the Camden enough. I would really recommend this hotel to anyone. The swimming pool is excellent aswell",5,2013,06,03
248,Great location but guests are drunk and loud.,"The hotel itself was good and in a decent location. With that being said, bars are close by and it is very loud at night (early morning) when drunk guests return. I know that is to be expected in a big city but this trip I was traveling with family. Not ideal for children. It reminds me of staying on Bourbon Street in New Orleans.  People were shouting, bouncing off walls and slamming doors. We had a ""Do Not Disturb"" sign on our door and it apparently made us a target because at 3:00 a.m. someone pounded on our door, took the sign and ran down the hallway. 

The staff were friendly and accommodating. They allowed us to check in early which was great because we had an overnight flight to Dublin and were exhausted. The food in the bar was good and the entertainment was fun. 

If you don't mind loud guests then this hotel is for you. Parking is convenient and complimentary. ",4,2013,06,03
248,Nice Stay,"We recently stayed here towards the end of our weeklong Ireland stay. It was a nice hotel with a great Irish breakfast. We liked that it was fairly central and we could walk to Grafton Street and the Temple Bar area, which we did one night but the temple bar area was so crowded we ended up coming back and having a drink in the hotel bar, which was great. They also make wonderful hot whiskeys. This was our first hot whiskey and it was delicious. Overall, a great 2 night stay.",4,2013,06,02
248,Great hotel,"We stayed at the Camden Court for the weekend and could not fault it.  Very well located with a short walk into town, 5 mins and you are at the top of Grafton Street.  Lovely hotel, clean and the staff are all very helpful and friendly.  We had a great room on the 5th floor with lots of space.  Beds were comfy and bathrooms very clean.  Breakfast was very nice, well presented and lots of choice.

I also had a spa treatment which was very nice

I would recommend this hotel to anyone and would stay there again if we were ever in Dublin.",5,2013,06,02
248,Good central hotel for business trips,This hotel is perfectly located for the city centre and was perfect for my business trip. The rooms are clean and comfortable but can be noisy. Leisure facilities and the restaurant are both excellent. If you have time enjoy a pint in The Bleeding Horse next door.,4,2013,06,01
248,"Lovely decorated rooms, good breakfast and nice location","I loved this hotel situated really central in Dublin. The breakfast was really good, with good variety and delicious presentation and I really liked the interior of the rooms, delicate colours and quite new (recently renovated) I guess.",5,2013,06,01
248,Great Location!,"Stayed here for a Saturday night in a family room. Check in was fast and easy, went up to our family room, sharing with 2 girls amd totally shocked by how large the rooms are. Loads of space and storage. Our room had not been updated to the new decor, but was still clean tidy and crisp. 

Hotels location is brilliant, within walking distance of Stephen's green and the green luas is litteraly on the doorstop. Great at night as the stumble home is also short. The hotel bar is great can't compliment our barman Darren (or Damien) he fed and looked after us great at 3 in the morning!!
Staff were very freindly could not have been more helpful.
Another great thing is the hotel has free parking which is a huge bonus in Dublin.
Can not recommend this hotel enough, rooms are clean and big, breakfast is great and staff are very helpful. 
Great for a weekend away.",5,2013,05,31
248,Excellent mature hotel in the heart of the City,"It was on short notice for work that I booked the Camden Court Hotel.
My primary reason was location as it was close to friendlyent's base & still a healthy walk (10 - 15 mins) from the shopping area of Grafton St.

The hotel is not the newest, most chic hotel out there, but has a lovely, comfortable, ""lived in"" feel to it. (I mean that in a good way!)

Rooms are huge, meticulously clean & well appointed. In fact the entire property is a credit to the team as it is super clean. Room service was fantastic, excellent selection & an additional order charge of only €2.75, one of the lowest I've ever encountered!

Where this proprty really shines is in the now more important than anything area of service. The staff are amazing, all friendly,  smiling & chatty.

What has put this hotel firmly on ""will be back"" list is value for money. FREE WiFi  throughout, including the rooms, and FREE parking!!! In central Dublin you won't beat that. Highly recommended.",4,2013,05,30
248,Nice hotel - nice lesiure centre,"I stay here a lot because of work and find it a very nice place - the location is great (work and Whealens both just down the road) and the rooms are spotless. There is a little bit of street noise in some rooms but maybe I'm oversensitive to traffic noise seeing as I'm a culchie up in Dublin. 
The leisure center is really clean throughout and towels are provided on entry. The sauna is newly renovated, clean and bright, and comes complete with real coals and a water bucket as opposed to the heaters we normally get in Ireland. There's a nice pool and a steam room/jacuzzi that are also spotless. The gym is nice and compact and has a good mix of Cardio and weights equipment. The free weights go to 30kg and there are plenty machines and a solid barbell rack for lifting bigger weights. The staff are welcoming and friendly and it's a great place to go after work rather than watching T.V in your room. As hotel leisure centers go this is tops for me.",4,2013,05,29
248,Regular Guest,"Am a fairly regular guest to the hotel and this hotel is a great place to stay.

The staff are friendly and accomodating. The facilities are good, with a well stocked gym and pool.

The food is good, and well priced. The rooms are comfortable and modern and are sufficient to my needs.",4,2013,05,29
248,a great place to go and near enough city,"the staff and food  we had dinner one night ,lovely décor,stayed with the children and they loved the pool and my daughter is 11 and a vegetarian and was looked after very well by the staff  who were very friendly breakfast was very nice in the morning no pressure or rush with it. and the room was a good size for us all were really were able to relax.",4,2013,05,28
248,Very nice hotel,"Nice hotel, fairly close to shopping and attractions. When we checked in we were greated by a very friendly desk staff, while walking to our rooms we noticed the hallways and doors were a little worn, but the room was very clean and renovated. When we went to bed later that evening we noticed there was not a top sheet on the bed so we called the desk and they brought one right up, and made sure I had one on the bed the next day when making up the room. Desk was very attentive to every need, from sheets, to cabs, wakeup calls, to setting up early breakfast the morning we checked out. Very nice hotel, would stay again.",4,2013,05,27
248,Lively neigbourhood,"Room is spacious and clean. Outside looks a bit outdated but no worries.
Good breakfast if you like Full Irish.
Plenty take aways, restaurants, Tesco Express, Spar and pubs around.
Approx 10-15min walking to city center.",3,2013,05,27
248,Awesome!,This place is a great place to stay! Friendly staff! Especially Darren in the bar! Thank you for pouring the perfect Guinness! Rooms were clean and beds were nice and warm. Located outside the square but nicely located near pubs and food!                                                              ,5,2013,05,25
248,Enjoyed our stay!,"Really enjoyed our stay here. Bedroom was basic but modern and clean. Not a great view- out onto an office block. Breakfast was great, loads to choose from! Fruit, cooked breakfast, salmon... We used the swimming pool but were required to use swimming caps, we used our shower caps to save buying any. Jacuzzi pool, sauna and steam room were great, awesome way to heat up from a cold Dublin day. Hotel was decorated really nicely for Christmas and staff were helpful too.",4,2013,05,25
248,Best Pool in Dublin,"Location is great for central Dublin - easy access to St. Stephens Park and downtown shopping and music, via walking or by short tram line and walking - (thru an attractive neighborhood of professional offices and homes).  Rooms are well enough decorated, larger than I expected, clean,  comfortable with very good storage for suitcases and clothes, great tea set up.  We asked for and got a quiet room. Elevators fast,  lobby attractive enough.
Took us a long while to figure out we could turn off the heat and it would still be reasonably warm; until then, we were sleeping hot!  Baths and showers were top rate,
I was underwhelmed with the dining room breakfast and in our five days, only visited once. 
 I made several special requests of the staff, and they were consistently very kind, personable, and  helpful.   For me, a slightly disabled person, making use of the large pool in the basement which allowed me to get some real exercise, was a total treat. Swimming in
one of the best three indoor pools I have ever swum in is what places this hotel int highest possible category for me.",5,2013,05,21
248,Pleasantly surprised!,"My husband & I stayed here on 17th & 18th May 2013 and were very pleasantly surprised, the room was spacious and the bed huge, we were on the 5th floor and it was nice and quiet, the shower was excellent, I went to the pool and it was lovely, clean and relaxing. All the staff were friendly, everyone said ""good morning"" and were very polite.  Breakfast was very enjoyable and I liked that we got a pot of coffee and it was hot!! I will definitely stay here again.  It is a great location, away from all the hustle and bustle of the city, and near enough to everything. If I had to find a fault, it would be the layout of the bar, it is a bit peculiar, but that's the only thing.",4,2013,05,21
248,Great hotel in great location.,"Excellent city centre hotel, easy to find by car & foot, free onsite parking.  Rooms are very nicely decorated, clean, comfortable and quiet considering city centre location.  Bar food reasonably priced and good service.  Breakfast was lovely.  Staff were very helpful.  Will definitely return.  Room prices were slightly dearer than normal but reasonable considering Heineken Cup was on.",4,2013,05,20
248,Recent stay 11th May 2013,I have stayed at The Camden Court Hotel several times & never had any problems with the room or staff & this applies to my most recent stay for 1 night on the 11th May 2013. The only difference this time is we had breakfast which involved a 15 minute wait for tea/coffee so we decided to ask the waitress ourselves at it was obvious we wasn't going to get served. The breakfast wasn't very nice it was a self service type set up & most of the food was dried up so I definitely wouldn't include breakfast again. If I was being picky about the room the only thing I could fault it on was we had a wobbly cold water tap other than that is was clean & comfortable. The staff are all lovely & very helpful.,4,2013,05,19
248,Great cosy hotel withing walking distance of most major attractions,"What a cosy little hotel near all the good stuff.

Can walk from the hotel to almost all major attractions such as the  attractions (hospital and the goal) in Kilmainhaim.

Rooms area decent size, the restaurant s quite goid and the breakfast choice is quite good also.

Worth a stay.",4,2013,05,19
248,A great stay! Yvonne is a star!,"We booked a theatre package to see The Lion King. Our rooms were clean, spacious and warm. The staff were very helpful and pleasant. The dinner we received as part of our package was delicious and the menu was varied and modern. Breakfast was plentiful and happily went on until 11am! This sleep lover was overjoyed! 
On the day we were due to leave, one of our party fell ill. Yvonne at reception was great, quickly checking availability and securing us a room for one more night. I'd happily stay there again and will certainly advise others to visit!",5,2013,05,16
248,Bestindublin,"I stayed here this week for one night this trip. I have stayed here quite a lot over the past few years. I used to to stay in Dublin a lot a few years ago and although I tried other hotels once I discovered this one I stopped looking. The rooms are very nice. Many of them are newly refurbished now.The car parks are on site and secure and they are also free which is rare in the center of Dublin.The leisure center is free and never too busy. The food is good. The hotel is in a great city center location. It is very reasonably priced given the hotel standard and it's location. Most importantly the staff, all of them, are very friendly and extremely helpful. I normally stay here when in Dublin on business but when I come to Dublin for a break I also stay here.
I have recommend this hotel to family, friends and colleagues and have always had positive feedback.",5,2013,05,16
248,nice hotel in a great location,"The hotel is in a good location & free parking, I was only staying for one night & was happy with my room very clean & I must have been in a quite area of hotel as did not hear any noise.  I had a lovely breakfast the next day & as Dublin seems expensive the room was value for money.",4,2013,05,16
248,great value and a great location.,"Stayed here recently with my wife and 3 year old. It was our first time to stay at this hotel or in this part of the city. Was very satisfied with parking, checking in, quality of room and value for money ( we got a mid-week 2 night deal). Staff efficient and friendly and breakfast was up to expectations.The pool in the basement was something you don't  expect in a city center hotel and went down a treat with the little one.Location is superb, right beside the tramline stop and round the corner from the police station.We will be back.",4,2013,05,14
248,Are we talking about the same hotel?,"I wasn't going to comment on our stay at the Camden Court, as we were only there one night in passing. However, we are thinking of spending more time in Dublin later in the year and we would certainly consider staying here again. Reading some of the reviews while researching our trip, though, I did wonder if we were talking about the same hotel. Yes, it's a big hotel with maybe not as much character as you'd get in a quaint rural B&B. It's obviously geared for the business sector, and shows a certain functionality in the way it's run - but then I like efficiency in hotel management. The continuous hum of the traffic on the busy main road outside all through the night might be disturbing for some visitors, but not to sound sleepers like us.
Everything else about the hotel was a plus - efficient, friendly staff, clean comfortable room, decent breakfast and a good evening meal. The location near St Stephen's Green means you are within walking distance of all the main tourist attractions and shopping areas, though sadly we didn't have enough time to do everything we would have liked. Good excuse to come back and stay here again! The prices are reasonable for this expensive city too. Nice hotel, we both liked it a lot. We must be easier to please than some of the other reviewers!",4,2013,05,13
248,Another very enjoyable stay at Camden Court Hotel,"My husband and 2 children (11yrs and 16yrs) visit this hotel at least twice yearly and stayed here  on Sunday 5th May for 1 night.  We were early for check-in to our room but were able to avail of the scrumptious buffet breakfast ! I requested a 'newly refurbished' room and on check-in, the receptionist said she would 'do her best for us'. After a very tiring walk all the way to Henry Street and back, we were allocated Room 400. Wow !! the room was amazing.  This hotel is spotlessly clean, completely non-smoking and very up-to-date. Beds are really comfortable.  Staff are always pleasant and go out of their way to help you.  Breakfast is a wide variety from smoked salmon, hams and meat, fruit and natural yoghurt to the traditional full irish breakfast.   I have recommended this hotel to many of my friends who, like us, return time after time. This hotel is only a 10 minute walk to Grafton Street.   We were unable to get booked in here in February and stayed in another hotel. Did not in any way compare to the Camden Court Hotel and for this reason, we would not consider staying in any other hotel in Dublin.  An excellent, top class hotel !!!",5,2013,05,12
248,Good value in an expensive city!,I stayed at this hotel whilst attending the Camden Crawl music festival. It's location is excellent for this event as it is at one end of the crawl. The hotel itself is functional and the staff are friendly. The rooms are satisfactory and that is not a problem because Dublin is not a city where you should staying in your room for anything other than bed and shower action! The price was acceptable and this is a consideration when staying in this mystifyingly expensive city. Be prepared for the early morning serenades of the passing merry souls.,3,2013,05,11
248,Nice weekend.,"Just returned from a lovely relaxing weekend. Have stayed there before so knew the location etc. The staff are lovely. Rooms can be quite basic, stayed on the 4th floor. Only thing I can complain about was the heat in the rooms and no headboards and very few charging ports. That and the selection of food for vegetarians is very very limited. Also the bar menu is almost identical to the restaurant menu. Very poor selection for meat eaters also. Breakfast was lovely. And the drinks in the bar were spot on. Overall a little disappointed with the hotel and don't think I would stay again as I think nicer hotels can be gotten closer to the town for similar money",3,2013,05,07
248,Excellent location and staff,"I recently led a group of forty Americans from Columbus, GA--80% of whom are 60 and older--on a tour of England, Scotland and Ireland.  Our last stop was Dublin (one of my favorite large cities) and the Camden Court Hotel where we stayed four nights before flying back to the United States.  The location of the hotel was perfect--near St. Stephen's Green and a short walk from Nassau Street and Grafton Street. The staff was excellent and could not have been more accommodating.   The hotel lobby is welcoming and attractive.  The free in-room WiFi was great.  Because I fell and sustained an injury in Scotland, I needed the use of a wheelchair.  There was one available for me at check-in, and I was allowed to take it on the coach for day trips around the Dublin area.  I was also allocated a handicapped room on the fifth floor, which was a blessing.  The major disappointment with our room was that, unlike those on lower floors, it had not been refurbished, although the painter was in the hallway painting on our last day.  My presumption is that refurbishment began at the ground floor and worked its way up.  This aesthetic issue was a minor one when compared with the outstanding service of the staff.  Nikki in the restaurant was exceptional in her desire to make everything perfect for our travelers, and she succeeded.  The food was delicious and well-presented at our group dinners, and the breakfasts were phenomenal.  Several of the couples in our group celebrated anniversaries while we were traveling, and Nikki arranged for flowers and a special dessert for them at dinner.  Christian at the front desk offered invaluable assistance and advice on finding a  local physician and was happy to make sure we had cabs when we needed them for the doctor and the hospital.  All in all, this was a good experience and we would stay here again.",4,2013,05,06
248,Convenient but nothing more,"The reception looks nice but the rooms are basic and disappointing. The hotel is 15 min walk from Temple Bar, which is good and there was free parking. Breakfast was ok. The hotel is convenient but nothing more.",3,2013,05,03
248,Does the job but not home from home,"On arriving I was pleasantly surprised by the public areas and the overall hotel. Once I got to my room I was disappointed to see a very basic room with poorly tunes tv stations. The bath was shallow water not hot but the saving grace was the free wifi that was hi speed.

Over does a job and on balance not disappointing.

On a side not there is a homeless shelter opposite the the hotel and some strange sites can be seen.",4,2013,05,02
248,They made us happy,"Our initial experience made us wonder why this hotel had such a high rating. Although the lobby was great and check-in procedure smooth, we were pretty disappointed with our room. Stuck in an inside corner with a small window, and sparse furniture/decoration, the room felt more like a hostel than a hotel room. The biggest issue was that there was only one (yes, one) power outlet, and that already had a lamp and TV plugged into it. As nerds, we travel with two iPhones, two iPads, a laptop, and a camera - all which need daily charging. This wasn't going to work.

As we were staying for a week, I made a visit to the manager and relayed our concerns. The response was immediate, empathetic, and kind. By the time we returned later that day, we had been moved to a room that had been newly renovated (seems like there are some new, some old in this hotel). The new room was bright, nicely laid out, and had five or six outlets for our various toys. Beds are comfy and the housekeeping service is great.

At all times, the front desk and managerial staff were polite, helpful, and had a genuine concern for us. All we asked is that they make us happy, and they did.",4,2013,04,25
248,Girls weekend!!!,"Just spent two nights at Camden Court with sisters and friends. Overall it was okay. Would have liked two rooms beside each other and I suppose we should have requested at time of booking, but they were unable to help us we were actually on floor 3 and floor 5  not an ideal situation for girls all gettin ready to head out together. As well as that rooms on floor 3 have obviously been refurbished while floor 5 I felt was basic. They were really attic rooms, ours had one double and two single, the single beds didnt even have headboards more like a dormitory
Bar staff and reception staff were very pleasant, but coffee bar/lobby staff really could do with
with smiling!!!!  Hotel location quite good just a short walk (about 10 mins ) to grafton street area. I think there are probably better hotels in the area.",3,2013,04,23
248,Very good hotel,"I have stayed at the Camden Court Hotel over the years and as always the staff are very friendly and helpfull the hotel food is very good and the hotel is very clean and its only a short walk to the top of Grafton Street and the tram is only around the corner if you dont feel like the walk.I would recomend this hotel and will be back and with the swimming pool the hotel suits familys,couples and business stays",5,2013,04,23
248,Pokerclub on tour,We were with 6 man for a long weekend of Dublin. It is a fine hotel. The swimming ppol is great. It has a changing room with lockers and you get free towels. Only be aware that you need a swimming cap but they can be bought for 2.5 euro. The breakfast is of good quality. The food and drinks in the hotel bar is very good. The location is 10/15 minutes walk from grafton street/temple bar district. In the area there is Italian restaurant (little ceasar) and nice bar Odeon plus night clubs in Harbour street. Only negative is that we had some of the NOT refurbished rooms. But they were still nice and have a good bathroom.,4,2013,04,22
248,dublin w family,"Unfriendly, unhelpful front desk staff.
Dismal breakfast buffet. Might have been 
appealing at 6 AM but only shiny, congealed offerings
when grandsons and I arrived at 8:30.
Coffe bar staffer was not Irish born..
seemed to believe his lineage was regal.
Think the staff prefers business clients
not family vacationeers.

If I owned Camden Court, I would send the staff to the
Parker Hotel in Galway to be trained. 
That is a wonderful hotel.",2,2013,04,21
248,Lovers Weekend :),"Both myself & my partner decided to book a last minute weekend break away to Dublin, & after looking at quite a few hotels online the Camden Court Hotel seems to stand out from the rest.

When we arrived we were welcomed by a very friendly & helpful girl on reception who quickly booked us in and showed us where we could park (hotel has own parking).

Our room was a good size and very clean and tidy with a modern decor.

There is a car in the hotel called Central Bar and is a cosy spot :)

Breakfast was fab! There is something for everyone and the staff are very welcoming.

We used the spa also which I really couldn't fault and it was never really busy which was nice.

The hotel is situated quite central and takes about a 10 minute walk to get to the centre of Dublin.

All in all the hotel was great and there is nothing we could fault, we will definately be returning to this spot!",5,2013,04,21
248,"Great hotel, superb location, friendly staff","We stayed in Dublin for 5 days, my first ever trip to Ireland so was really pleased that the hotel was in a good area, walking distance from some great shops, restaurants and pubs.  The staff were very polite and helpful nothing was too much trouble.  A nice bar, didn't try the restaurant but looked lovely.  Rooms cleaned to a high standard every day, lovely shower lots of nice smellys in the bathroom.  The pool, jacuzzi and steam room were very nice clean and well kept, (tip you need a swimming cap to go in the pool, you can buy one at the pool reception).

The room overall was very quiet, the only thing I would say is it could have done with a net curtain as it overlooks some offices, but only minor, would definitely go back and recommend!",5,2013,04,19
248,Remarkable re-union,"A group of us stayed there last Sat night 13/04/2013, we were there  for a re-union & about 12 people stayed overnight.  We also arranged a meal & a drinks for 20 in the dining-room & because the group gelled so well the manager declined to move us to the bar after the meal.  Likewise for breakfast the next day, the dining-room staff recognised us as we arrived & sat us all together & left us to have the longest most enjoyable breakfast ever.  The rooms were great with all the usual facilities, great heat & bathrooms & very clean & comfortable.  Staff first rate & cheerful & friendly without over doing it.  Some of the party used the leisure facilities & were delighted with them.  A brilliant value for money stay & a good occasion made great by all concerned at this hotel.  Many thanks I would definately choose here again..............",5,2013,04,17
248,Pleasant stay,This is a well appointed 3 star hotel which is reasonably priced for this part of Dublin. I had a brief but comfortable stay here recently. Staff were friendly and in many ways this hotel competes favourably with plenty of 4 star hotels. One minor criticism was the light levels in the bathroom were a bit low.,4,2013,04,16
248,"Friendly & courteous service, excellent value","The Camden Court staff made all the difference during our stay for a 3 day meeting - with reception very helpful, going out of their way to help with the smallest enquiry. The rooms were comfortable with wifi, and a swimming pool and gym downstairs as well as parking. It is a 10 minute walk to Stephens Green and very close to the Luas Harcourt stop. We also had our meeting in the rooms there, and the food, service and hosting were great. A top choice in central Dublin",4,2013,04,16
248,Very Relaxing  Night,"was just in town for the night for the matchbox 20 gig in vicar street. thank you very much to Sonia on check in and Deirdre on check out, very helpful. bar was very nice and bar staff were polite.
room was perfect, spacious, spotless and warm. very quiet and had no complaints. thank you.",5,2013,04,15
248,Fab hotel,My partner and I stayed here on Friday 12th April must say it is a fabulous hotel. After reading comments on here wasn't very sure about staying glad I choose it stayed in room 319 beautifully decorated and very clean. The only fault we had was that breakfast wasn't included in the room which we paid €115 for and breakfast was an additional €26 a bit expensive in my opinion apart from that great hotel would stay here again,4,2013,04,15
248,Great hotel,"Stayed here in January while attending a friends civil partnership and honestly could not have been happier with everything. Clean comfortable room, friendly staff, fantastic location and very nice bar food. Also a very reasonable price. Would most definitely stay again.",4,2013,04,15
248,Wicked Weekend in Dublin,"Good location 10 - 15 min walk to centre.  Hotel was clean beds very comfortable shame the pillows were like blocks of wood (Would have been nice if house keeping had a small stock of softer pillows for those of us who don't like sleeping on rocks they didn't ). Spa area really nice relaxing space, pool, sauna and steam room all excellent. Staff were very helpful and polite, breakfast was very good with lots of choice.
Good all rounder would stay again but with my own pillow (lol).",4,2013,04,15
248,Overnight in Dublin,"Stayed at the Camden Court Hotel for the night when down for the Pink concert.  Was very good.. arrived at 1pm and the room was ready, the receptionist Sonia was really helpful and gave us advice re getting into the centre of Dublin and to the O2 arena... We walked to O'Connell Street in 20 mins and The Temple Bar area in 15 mins...... Had a few very reasonably priced cocktails in the bar before the concert....then walked back from the O2, which took 35 mins. Breakfast was plentiful and great selection, most items you could think of were available... Parking easy at the hotel and the room was fine, everything required, was available. Would/will definitely stay again!",5,2013,04,13
248,Spacious triple room,"Two friends and I stayed here Easter Monday for the night of the Olly Murs concert in the O2. Its quite a walk from O'Connell street but it is very near to Coppers and Flannerys. The area wasn't as busy as we thought it would be on a bank holiday weekend. 

The hotel was great. The staff were very helpful. I had initially tried to book a triple room online but they were all booked out. When i rang to enquire about a triple room they said they would ring me back the next day. Sure enough the following day, i got a phone call to say that a triple room was available. I was thinking we were going to be squished in somewhere on top of one another. When we arrived on the day of the concert, the room had two double beds and one single bed. We all slept well and liked the decor and cleanliness of the room and bathroom.

The room was €30 per person (breakfast not included) and parking was free up until 1pm on the day of check out. We had free wifi also. A total bargain!
 We will definitely bear this hotel in mind for future overnights stay in Dublin and 100% recommend it to a friend.",5,2013,04,13
248,Great location for restaurants and bars on Dublin's Southside,Stayed with US friends as part of The Gathering for St Patrick's Day Parade. Very friendly and helpful staff. Nice clean hotel. Bedrooms a bit dated and slightly bland. Beds nice and comfy. Free parking. Tea and coffee in room. Tesco store nearby. Close to bars and night clubs. Luas 50 meters away to take you to South Dublin. Would recommend this hotel.,4,2013,04,12
248,A lovely representative of what Ireland has to offer,"Recently we stayed 3 nights with the McMahon's Irish Pub tour (Warrenton, VA) and we were delighted with the rooms, the location and the service.  The breakfasts are lovely...and we were completely replete when we left!  So many conveniences near by...stores, shopping, pubs and the very necessary tourist visits.  We would recommend it for couples, families and friends.  When we come to Dublin again (and there will be an 'again') we will be sure to book our stay here.",4,2013,04,11
248,Delirious in Dublin,"My first time in Ireland was a blast! The hotel was awesome! The staff and accommodations were unbelievable too. Ireland was my ""#1 bucket list' and honestly the trip was so amazing that each day was better than the day before! The staff at Camden was amazing. Took care of us for everything and the room was beautiful. I enjoyed my stay to the max!! So nice.",5,2013,04,11
248,lovely,Good location we walked all over Dublin from here. Staff very friendly and helpful. Rooms small but nice. Bar on site with friendly bartenders. My husband and I would stay here again in the future.Dublin is a wonderful place with so much to see and do all made easier by getting a good nights sleep in comfortable beds and peace and quiet.,4,2013,04,10
248,Punches above its weight !!!,"Recently stayed here with my wife and three kids.
Friendly staff, clean rooms and great breakfast.
Good pool but freezing changing rooms.
All in all good value and nice location.
Luas tram system just behind the hotel means its very easy to get out to places like Dundrum with cinemas and shopping etc.",4,2013,04,09
248,"Great location,reasonable price.","We stayed here in feb for a concert in O2.
The hotel is located bout 10 minute from stephens green, and less than 5 minute walk from all the pubs and clubs on harcourt street.
we did have to get a taxi to the concert but we knew this before we booked.
The hotel was really nice and bewakfast was great really wide selection.
Car park was available aswel.",4,2013,04,09
248,Central location great price,"Have stayed here 3 times in the last few weeks and have enjoyed the hotel.  The staff are amazing and  attentive without ruining the experience of the hotel.  The rooms generally are great although some seem in better condition.  My favourite floor is the 6th.  I sent some feedback directly to the hotel and they acted upon it before my next stay. 
The food in the restaurant is lovely and the service is 2nd to none.  The breakfast is great and the food is varied and well prepared.  
Would recommend.",4,2013,04,08
248,good one night stay,"nice room and clean. clean bathroom, although water for shower cool in the evening.... pool is smaller than it looks in the photos.. the hot tub was being hogged by loud Americans....staff lovely and pleasant. would stay again :)",4,2013,04,08
248,A very pleasant place to stay and do business,"Admittedly I only stayed just one night in the Camden Court Hotel, but it was a pleasant experience. My bedroom was on the small side but very comfortable and very clean. I found the bed extremely comfortable and slept like a baby. The bathroom was spacious and well equipped. The reception and lobby area is very spacious and invites people to sit down and chat with friends and colleagues. Staff at the reception were very friendly and courteous and check in and check out formalities were efficiently done with a minimum of fuzz. Too bad I was not there long enough to check out the pool and gym facilities, but I did really like the full Irish breakfast buffet in the Iveagh restaurant. The restaurant is also very nicely designed.

I was taking part in a meeting in one of the hotel meeting rooms ('Gaiety"") and again it was spacious, clean and well equipped. They catered for us a lunch in the meeting room which was simple but of excellent quality.

Should I need to be in Dublin again for business or for pleasure, I am sure I will want to come back to this hotel, also because of its excellent location.",4,2013,04,08
248,Great staff,"Attended business conference.  Left California Sunday morning and arrived at the hotel Monday morning 10am.  I was pleasantly surprised to be able to check into my room immediately.  After getting settled walked 10 minutes to St. Stevens Green to catch Hop On Hop Off bus.  This was a great way to see Dublin for my first time.  I had many questions of the staff and Christian was very, very helpful and gave good recommendations as well. Even offering a space heater if the room was too cold. Bed very comfortable.  I would have liked to have a clock in the room, but this is a great place to stay in a really good location with excellent staff.",5,2013,04,08
248,Great Value,"Stayed here at the weekend after attending a gig in Temple bar. Was a lot cheaper than some hotels that were closer to the venue but worth the extra 15/20min walk. Staff were helpful and welcoming but not too over the top which can be annoying too. Room was very clean and had everything we needed, looks just like the pic on website, which is often not the case!Shower was lovely and powerful to revive our slightly hungover heads!Prob should have not gone to residents bar for those extra drinks! 
Plus parking was FREE!Very rare in the city centre.though I think this is limited, and you cant reserve parking so its not guaranteed free.
Perfect for a night out in town that is good value",4,2013,04,08
248,Great staff and location,"We enjoyed our stay at Camden Court.  It's not the fanciest hotel, but you get what you pay for.  The price was great and it was clean and comfortable.  Some people complained about the noise from the pub next door, but my husband and I actually really enjoyed having the Bleeding Horse Pub there.  It's a cool pub with AMAZING chicken wings and gets really busy (but fun!) on the weekends.  

The location of the hotel to sites to see in Dublin was also excellent. It's an easy 7-10 minute walk from St. Stephen's Green (I was told to call it ""Stephen's Green"" like locals do...) and overall just very walkable to a ton of things to see in the city.  The front desk staff provided us a map and we parked our car in the very teensy parking spaces in the garage below.  It was slightly challenging to navigate the garage, but we just didn't move the car until we left for the countryside.  DO NOT drive around Dublin to see things.  Parking is non-existant and it's really just not necessary.  It's accessible by foot or easily navigated via public transportation.  

Oh and the pool in the hotel was very pretty.  Unfortunately, we forgot our swimsuits and could not enjoy it, but it would have been nice!  We also worked out in the gym downstairs once during our stay.  It's small, but perfectly adequate for all of your work-out needs:).  Overall, I would definitely recommend Camden Court and would absolutely stay again if we ever return to Dublin.",4,2013,04,08
248,Excellent staff and central location,"Great hotel and wonderful staff at reception bar and breakfast.
Very central location. Breakfast is nice  and cocktails in bar are great. Superb hotel and staff. Fantastic breakfast. Very central location.
All staff at reception, Bar and breakfast are extremely friendly and exceptional.
Wont go wrong if you stay here.",5,2013,04,08
248,Great hotel and staff excellent,"Great Hotel, stayed here recently for one night, bar food was lovely, enjoyed pool and jacuzzi.  Bedroom was warm at night. Great car park.  Breakfast was fab, enjoyed all the food on offer. Reception staff were excellent.",4,2013,04,07
248,Very good location,Had a nice stay here. Facilities are excellent including gym and pool. Very close to temple bar and graften street. Staff are friendly and the food is good. The pub located in the hotel is very nice and the atmosphere is excellent there. Hotel reception was accommodating to our needs. Rooms get cleaned regularly so if you are in when the first pass comes don't worry. Conference facilities are very good too. Will definitely come back here again for a stay over.,4,2013,04,07
248,pleasant staff and lovely facilities,"had a great time here, lovely facilities and really nice staff, along with a relaxing pool and jacuzzi, this was the nicest hotel in Dublin I've ever been in, and I will return here on my next visit :)",4,2013,04,05
248,Good value!,"Handy for Dublin city centre and they honoured our request for a high floor at the back. (5th!) Good amenities and staff helpful. Only issue was housekeeping knocking on our door and stepping right in at 8am in the morning of our departure, and then kept coming back knocking even though check out wasn't until noon. Receptionist apologised profusely and at that stage there wasn't really anything they could have done about it to be honest. Would recommend it to others who don't mind doing the 10-ish minute dander to Dame Street.",4,2013,04,05
248,Mutton Dressed As Lamb?,"My first impressions on entering the room were mostly favourable. Not for long though! The lighting is terrible - especially in the bathroom which may be a good thing because:

tiles coming away and gaps between floor and wall tiles, unfinished trim at base of bath, safety stop missing off one of the shower controls (just a space were it should have been), thin small towels, generally very dingy.

In the main room the heating is from a very noisy radiator and the carpet looks old and tired, scuff marks on skirting boards and walls, inside of kettle looks horrible, no safe, very old TV.

Actually the most annoying aspect was the lack of net curtains at the window that was overlooked by an office block. This meant keeping the curtains closed until I had finished getting up and dressed.

I could go on and may do so as I am only 1 day into a 3 night stay!",1,2013,04,05
248,Choice location in Dublin,"We just spent a week at this hotel in Dublin.  It was quiet and comfortable, and an easy walk to both the city center and Rathmines.  The staff was very helpful and there were good restaurants nearby.  We didn't eat in the restaurant but did have a meal in the bar.  There is also a spa at the hotel, but I didn't have time to check it out.",5,2013,04,04
248,Location location location!,"Having entitled my review location location location, the Camden Court Hotel has so much more to offer. Aga in reservations was most helpful over the phone and Pawel at reception greeted me by name on arrival. So staff get a thumbs up. 
Room was decent, very clean and comfortable. My room faced an office block and I could have done with net curtains instead of having to close blackout curtains coming out of the shower. All other conveniences were in room including a box of tissues.
Leisure centre was great ...it's so difficult to find a city centre hotel with a pool at a reasonable price. Lovely long pool and clean dressing rooms, what more could you need?
Lobby very welcoming. I didn't eat there, or use the beauty salon.
Parking is tight and first come first served. But it's safe and free.
Back to location, several bus routes pass hotel taking you north or south of the city. Luas green line at the back of the hotel. Shops, restaurants, convenience store all within easy walking distance.
All in all would strongly recommend a stay in the Camden Court!",4,2013,04,04
248,Great barman (Darren) servin great cocktails!,Great night  with all da boxin boys very patient an pleasing staff thank you!:) good atmosphere pleasant people anything we requested we got ! no complaints a night to remember we we'll definitely be back ,5,2013,04,03

248,Lovely Hotel Great Location,We stayed at the Camden Court Hotel  for a couple of nights while we were looking at Universities in Dublin.  The staff were very helpful on arrival and throughout our stay. Rooms were comfortable and clean.  The hotel is excellently located for getting around with St Stephen's Green only a short walk from the hotel.  You can take the no 16 bus from the airport which drops you just outside the hotel just ask the bus driver.  No complaints plan to stay there again.,4,2013,04,02
248,Great location,Stayed in Camden court for 1 night. Got good price as booked on the day... Was lucky to get free parking but its not guaranteed. 10 minute walk to st Stephens green. The room was clean and we had a quiet room over the courtyard. Will definitely stay there again,4,2013,03,31
248,Excellent hotel for business trip,"I stayed at Camden Court Hotel for a short business trip. It is ideally located at the city and business centro of Dublin so you can go walking to almost anywhere in the city. The breakfast buffet was awesome, one of the best ones!!",5,2013,03,31
248,Great find,Have stayed in Dublin many times for many reasons but never here before. Excellent location. Very unusual to get leisure centre so near to city centre. Walking distance to luas/Stephens green. Very friendly staff. Rooms really nice. Great value. Didn't eat here but had a lovely cocktail in bar. Will definitely stay here again,4,2013,03,30
248,Great Night Away,"Me and my husband stayed here for one night when we were going to a concert in the O2.it is very close to city center you can walk it, When we arrived we could not find a parking space (free parking) when i went in to ask in the hotel about this they couldnt have been more helpful!!! even took me down to find a space himself for us!!!! Our room was spotless so was the bathroom and the bed was so comfortable had the best nights sleep in ages...We are looking forward to staying there again :)",5,2013,03,30
248,location,stayed here for 4 nights with two kids.hotel is close to dublin city centre  and just a two minute walk from harcourt st.luas stop.hotel has a swimming pool which is great especially if the weather is as cold as it was this week.ate in both the restaurant and bar food was  good.breakfast was the normal buffet which is served in most hotels.i thought the hotel was good value for money,4,2013,03,29
248,How one stay can alter you entire view,"So, its 04.40 and for the second night my sleep has been disturbed. Last night it was the young lady revellers who returned at 02.20 and proceeded to discuss (in fluent Mandarin so it seemed) the whereabouts of ones room key. Ok but this was opposite my door at the tops of their voices with no regard for other guests. I could perhaps have put up with a brief discussion but after ten minutes I started to get annoyed. By the time I was in a position or state (dressed) to remonstrate they had found the key, embraced and parted. Back to bed and nearly asleep before one returned to her friend to tell her she wanted to stay. Get a room will you guys - just get a room!

It was difficult to get back to sleep until much later so I was rather tired in the office that day. An early night called and so it was to bed at about 10.30. Some time into my somnambulence the banging started, gently at first like a lovers touch. Soon however the noise got louder with shouting  ""Stephen! Open the door!"" It went on, more and more insistent - a slightly drunk but aggressive English man, banging, kicking screaming. Other guests asked him to keep quiet but oh no - Stephen had locked the door from the inside so the key our man , lets call him Yob, had, would not open the door. Did anyone want to go outside and challenge the raging monster? Of course they didn't. 

Eventually some resolution occurred but if it was Stepen who let him in I suspect he was going to feel the hard edge of Yob's tongue. 

So now its too late to go back to sleep and here I am. 

My previous stays here have been good. I chose ths hotel as it felt far more welcoming than others nearby. The restaurant food (The Iveagh) was very good. I have had many meals there and never a disappointment. The presentation is good and the food very tasty. The staff are helpful and the rooms have all you need (apart from a sewing kit but the pink shop over the road is a seamstress who will sew and mend for a fee). 

Previously I have stayed at the front or back and it has been quiet. This time I am at the side overlooking the road and the soundproofing is inadequate ....

Hold on - its now 0545 and hotel staff with walkie talkies are in the corridor. That is all tired guests need! 

Anyway back to the noise of passers by in the street - most too inebriated to realise that shouting tunelessly ""Brian!"" over and over is unlikely to attract his attention as he has passed out. 

Oh wonderful! it's all kicked off again - sob story! ""Of course I am married"" but I think what stops anyone interfering is the comment ""I'm just a kick boxer but you're a black belt!"" Do we really want to complain to his face? 

Whilst waiting for the next round I will say that the breakfast is good and the bar prices are fine- in fact the bar is a lot more friendly than most hotels although not as good as the local hostelries. 

So realistically I like the hotel but this trip has been plagued by those individuals who just can't hold their drink. Don't get me wrong - I like a drink as much as the next man - if not more so. But for some - and you know who you are - you are better ff on the lemonade. 

Will I stay here again? Probably, although a trip on the train from Wicklow seems a fair price to pay for a peaceful nights sleep.  

It's still an hour to breakfast ... I would have rated here better if it had not been for this trip but we must take as we find and I found this unpleasant and tiring. 

",3,2013,03,27
248,Decent enough stay,"Stayed at the hotel recently.  In a nice handy location, rooms are pleasant and nice added addition of having a leisure center.  However, the room was very cold and appeared to be on a timer, which meant that it was only on briefly early evening.  I woke up in the morning with a cold as a result, which wasn't ideal.  In saying that, reception staff were very attentive, the room was nice and clean and the overall facilities were decent.

I must make a comment about the hotels bar/restaurant.   When we went to order a drink around 1pm-2pm on Saturday after we had checked in, the two gentleman at the bar (who actually looked like twins) decided to have a conversation between themselves and had acknowledged eye contact but did not rush themselves to serve us.  Five minutes later, the gentleman came to serve us and took the payment by debit card.  He took the payment machine with my card still in it and set it down on the counter and walked away for a further 3 minutes and proceeded to have a conversation with the other gentleman and also went to collect glasses.  I was unhappy about this as no apology was made and any customer that came in afterwards was attended to immediately and attentively.  It wasn't busy as there was nobody else standing at the bar to be served and there must have been about 5 persons in total in the bar.  

These issues had brought down the overall rating but this aside, I would still return to the hotel as the facilities and the service from the reception staff was excellent but I would appreciate if the problems at the hotel bar were looked into.

Regards

Paul :)",3,2013,03,26
248,Great hotel perfect location - wonderful staff,First of all i'd like to thank the bar man Darren for his great hospitality and warm welcoming he definitely made our stay a lot more pleasant as for the hotel and the facilities everything was up to standard great area close to city centre me and my sister will most certainly be returning to the Camden court hotel many thanks to all from the cardiff girls xxx,5,2013,03,23
248,Very pleasant stay,"I spent two nights at the Camden Court Hotel on a business trip.  I arrived to an impressive large looking hotel with an impressive reception area.  The receptionist was very pleasant and checked me in efficiently and gave me all the information that I required.  My room was on the 6th floor, number 612 if I recall correctly.  

When I got to the sixth floor I noticed a stale smell, and when I got into my room the smell was even stronger, although the window was open.  The smell resembled a well slept in bed smell, very unpleasant.  I was also unable to operate the radiator in the room, so I called down to reception to inform them of my issues.  At this point I was considering checking out of the hotel to stay elsewhere.  Hoewever, the young man on reception very kindly said that he would try to find me an alternative room.  He called back a few minutes later and offered me a change of room, to a family room which had been refurbished.

I went to my new room, number 318 which had not only been refurbished but was a large family room.  The room was stunning and had bee refurbished to excellent standards.  It was very clean and there was no bad smell!  I was very happy with the room and service.  

Food in the hotel was excellent with a huge choice for breakfast and lunch.  I have dietary requirements and the hotel catered for my needs excellently.  

I did not get the chance to use the hotel leisure facilities but they looked to be very good.  

The bar prices were good and all staff very friendly.  I must also say that this was one of the only hotels that I have stayed in where the wi-fi actually worked very well.  I had a seminar in the hotel and found the business facilities to be very good all round.

In all I would definitely stay in the Camden Court again, but would request a refurbished room upon booking.  I can recommend the hotel on this basis and thank the staff for a very pleasant stay.",4,2013,03,22
248,St paddeys week end,"Stayed here for 2 nights,sat & sun.it was paddeys week end so very busy.hotel great location,can't fault a thing,rooms clean very lush.would stay again.it was the first time in Ireland so was happy that staff where friendly and gave us good advise.we used the spa after a night  on the town drinking the best Guinness in the world.",5,2013,03,19
248,Business stay,"Good hotel, good price, and great breakfast. Some (but not all) of the the gym equipment is a bit tired but in general is reasonably well stocked with weights and cardio machines. The Hotel is well situated and priced competitively. I've stayed in much more expensive hotels with less quality than this one.",4,2013,03,19
248,Match day in the bar,"Was there on Saturday for the Irish match. The bar was quiet which meant plenty of comfort. We had a little one with us so she didn't interrupt anyone's viewing but mine! 
We order drinks and food, the drinks arrived promptly and the food came quickly after.
I had the burger with home fries, herself had the curry. The burger was tasty, the bun however was the soft type which collapsed with the moisture in the relish.
The curry was bland with not enough sauce. But that was rectified promptly by the waitress.
The two negatives - the child seat was filthy. Considering the speed the vomiting bug is spreading amongst children it wouldn't hurt to give these a decent thorough clean every now and then. I needed a knife to get a piece of welded on cucumber off the seat.
And Ireland drew...but the hotel had no hand in that.

Overall the staff were very friendly and attentive and on the ball.
The front of house staff were also very friendly. I'd definitely visit again.",4,2013,03,11
248,Loved our stay at the Camden Court Hotel,"My husband and I have been staying here for the past couple weeks, and we have thoroughly enjoyed our visit. It was a fantastic stay while we transition from the USA (Wyoming), to the Emerald Isle for work relocation. The Hotel Staff have been so helpful with everything, and we can't thank them enough. 
The facilities are very nice, clean and well kept.  The in house restaurant, The Iveagh, offers free breakfast to hotel guests, which is a buffet of hot food items which are all delectable, as well as breads/toast, fresh fruit and cheese, yogurt, cold cereal, fruit juice, and your choice of coffee or tea.  The restaurant also offers buffet style lunch with everything from scrumptious hot food items (example: roast pork loin with vegetables, stuffing, gravy) to salads and sandwich makings.  They are also open for dinner with menu items and specials with a great price for the quality.  There is a bistro/bar, C Central, that offers menu items as well from appetizers to desserts, all for a great price for the quality.  Just off the lobby at The Iveagh entrance, is a coffee/tea bar for refreshment.  Another lovely offering is the fact that you can sit in the beautiful lobby and enjoy food items from the Bistro menu. 
This hotel offers FREE Wifi, yes, thats right I said free, and that is a rare luxury indeed.  As System Administrators, and owners of a Web Hosting company, this was quite fortuitous. 
Our room was quite comfortable, and even though we were located on the 5th floor with rooms above and around us, there wasn't a peep that was heard.  The nearby street is a busy one, and noisy if you leave the window open, but once the window is closed, it is very quiet. The hotel is in a great location, and not far from most of the Dublin attractions.  There are bus stops located quite near the hotel that go any direction you need to catch.  It is about 10 minutes via bus from the city Center.  We never had enough time to enjoy the pool/hot tub or exercise facilities, but we did go and look at them~and everything looks great.  
Long story short, we highly recommend this Hotel and we will be back to enjoy the wonderful food and atmosphere often! Thank you so much, Camden Court! ♥",5,2013,03,08
248,"Good location, 80 deg. F in room, could not sleep","Lovely hotel in many ways, great location, good breakfast, BUT, most important feature of any hotel, was totally uncomfortable, could NOT sleep since room was SO HOT.  We turned off radiator and opened window.  When window open, huge safety SEARCH LIGHTS from office parking lot and building across the way, shined directly into my eyes, so I had to sleep (attempt) on my right side facing away from window.  Each time I turned by mistake, bright lights woke me.  I will not stay at this hotel again.",1,2013,03,08
248,"Good hotel, convenient but slightly shabby location","Had a family break for my 50th birthday and the hotel could not have been better(including a birthday upgrade!) or the staff more friendly and helpful. We all made the most of the pool and spa which were clean and not very busy except on the Sunday afternoon when there were suddenly families with small children everywhere!
Excellent value and my only criticism wouldn't be of the hotel but the area it is situated in, while within a 5 minute walk of the city centre, is a bit down at heel. Several massage parlours close by and quite a few people begging for money on the streets, including one particularly persistent and slightly aggressive individual closer to the city centre. No problem in daylight but a bit unnerving after dark - we took taxis back to the hotel at night as the children were a bit intimidated.
Having said all that, would thoroughly recommend.",4,2013,03,05
248,Home from Home,I have been staying at the Camden Court Hotel on regular business trips to Dublin for over 2 years having tried a number of alternatives prior to alighting upon this little gem.  Great location for hitting the city centre or a cheeky pint in Camden Street and good size comfortable rooms.  The staff are always keen to help and are efficient in seeing to requests and queries - what not to like!,4,2013,03,04
248,Great Location and Friendly Staff,"We recently stayed here for 2 nights and had a great time.The staff were very helpful on check in, which was good.The room we had was excellent-and they would have got a 5, but the rooms dont have fridges-even mini bars, and the rooms dont have safes-even in this day.Other than those minor issues, it was a fantastic stay with parking, easy access to go out into town and down to the shops.The pool staff were also very helpful and it was nice to relax in the steam rooms.We got breakfast elsewhere as it was cheaper.",4,2013,03,04
248,Great spot,"Stayed here with friends for a night out in town. Perfectly located. We ate on Camden street, only 5 minutes walk from the hotel and spent the rest of the night between Camden st and harcourt st, also a stones throw from the hotel. Our expectations weren't huge as it was reasonable enough for the triple room but hotel was lovely and perfect for what we needed. We overheard another guest complaining about noise but frankly I wouldn't expect anything different with its location. Rooms were basic but absolutely perfect for a night away in town. Would be a great place to stay if shopping south side either (Stephens green side I'd town). Didn't pay for breakfast but there were so many cafes within two minutes walk we ate nearby.",4,2013,03,03
248,Good hotel with convenient location,"Centrally located within 20 to 30 minutes walking distance of most visitors sights. The hotel is good value for the money, and although the fixed price breakfast is high there are alternatives within a few minutes of the hotel. The staff is friendly and seemed to want to please. There is convenient bus service to go downtown, and even to the airport.",3,2013,02,26
248,Such a pleasure!!,"We booked this hotel to be central to St. Stephen's Green as we had a theatre night to see Once, the musical at the Gaiety Theatre and also a birthday to celebrate. This hotel is approx. 5mins walk from the green. It is modern, has a beautiful swimming pool and Gym and the decor is lovely. We were on the 6th floor initially, but as my partner has a bad back, found the bed quite hard and asked to be moved. No problem, we were moved to a newly decorated 3rd floor room with a larger and softer bed. Ideal!!
The staff were very nice and will help you with anything you need.
Surrounded by offices but with the rooms being lovely, it doesn't matter!!",5,2013,02,26
248,Decent / comfortable stay in the heart of Dublin!!!,"This hotel is the heart of the city at the Camden Street. It's two minutes walking from my office at Hatch Street, which makes it the most convenient place to stay in. The rooms are spacious and neatly done. The property is maintained well and frankly you cannot complain about anything there.",3,2013,02,26
248,Dublin Visit,"Camden Court Hotel proved a good choice for our groups Dublin visit  to the National Stadium for the National Elite Boxing Championships Finals.
Well located in central Dublin and easy reach to sports venues and Dublin theaters.
A spacious layout of resturant,bar and lounge area gave a good impression with good quality rooms at mid price range that gave good value and good fare.
The gum facilities, swiming pool and Wi Fi facility will have me back for the next Dublin visit.

             Regards Sean Horkan.",4,2013,02,25
248,Good and bad,"Good
Location, near all good nightlife and the luas and Restraunts, nice pool and sauna in the morning
Bad
There was sweet papers on the bathroom floor when we got to the room, not a big deal but it just meant the floor was defiantly not mopped which isn't the most pleasant feeling. Breakfast was supposed to finish at 11, by 10.15/20 they stopped replenishing food so be down early its not 'really' 11am, we were going to have some pasterys and were told there was none left, before 11 by the way, but we could go to the small coffee counter and buy some if we liked. For the price we paid 115 room only theres defo better value to be had, breakfast was €26..  Date of stay 23rd feb.",4,2013,02,25
248,"Very friendly staff, great hotel, but heating was on too high the first night we stayed there","I think this is a great hotel, but the first night we stayed there the heating was far too high. It was hard to sleep.

I'm sure that this was a once-off problem though.

This problem was fixed the second night we stayed there.",4,2013,02,24
248,V good but could do without the wake up call from the cleaners,"The camden court is a great hotel, perfect convenient location near pubs and restaurants. Friendly receptionist and overall highly recommend it. We stayed valentines night and hada great night. My only complaint was the rude awakening by a hoover being clattered off our door at 9 am. I understand people have a job to do but cant help but feel this was done deliberately.  Apart from this, no complaints",4,2013,02,23
248,"Staff Let It Down - Otherwise, Good.","I'll stay here 90% of the time when in Dublin. It's a brilliant location, under a 10 minute walk to Grafton street, or just hop on the Luas! A big let down is the staff - quite glum, unhelpful, unprofessional and tired looking. I overlook this on account of the location. It mustn't be a great place to work. The buffet breakfast is really tasty and always a good buzz in it in the mornings. The rooms are alright, they do the job. Some are refurbished, some aren't. Ask to stay on the quiet side of the hotel or else you'll be awake all night!",4,2013,02,20
248,Good place to stay,Stayed for one night sat. Lovely clean bright hotel. Good enough location. Around corner from St Stephens Green. Not raining so we enjoyed walking around.20 mins to most places on foot. Bit far out if it was raining though. Might need taxi. Staff courteous & efficient. Pool area very clean.   Maybe more mats around pool for walking on. Was very slippy. 99 euro for room. No breakfast. Bit pricey. ,5,2013,02,18
248,Great city-centre stay,"We stayed at Camden Court in January 2013, and really enjoyed our stay there. We arrived on the Thursday morning in Dublin and took the Air Coach bus from the airport to Leeson Street, as directed on the website. You then cross the road and it's a relatively short walk to the hotel. It's also very conveniently located for the Luas (tram) and easy walking distance through St Stephen's Green to Grafton Street. 

We were impressed by the lobby and the hotel staff were very friendly, and stowed our luggage when we went out to sight-see. We later returned and went up to our rooms. The room wasn't as lovely as it looks online, but for the price we paid, we were very pleased with it. It was sizeable, quiet, we had a nice bathroom with a bath, so we couldn't have asked for any more.

We didn't get breakfast at the hotel, because there's plenty of places around to grab a coffee and something small or even a short walk to getting a full Irish. But the restaurant looked very nice from what we could see. 

It was a real bonus having a leisure centre. Great to have a swim after a long day walking around, and to use the sauna, jacuzzi and steam room. Over in Ireland, swimmers are required to wear a swim cap and you can buy one at the hotel for 4 euros. 

Overall, it was a great base to see the city.",4,2013,02,18
248,Nice hotel for the budget..,Friendly customer oriented service by staff.. clean and spacy rooms.. good food.. placed in a an awesome location for who are interested in exploring the city.. I will be there again in this March.. :),4,2013,02,18
248,Fabulous,My husband and I stayed for the weekend with friends. We found the reception staff very friendly and helpful. Hotel rooms were lovely and it was in a really good location for seeing the sights of Dublin. The pool was great and lovely to relax after a long day. The restaurant was beautiful and we had an exceptional meal. We would definitely book to go back again.,5,2013,02,18
248,Great weekend..,Third time I have stayed at this hotel when visiting on boys rugby trip. Great reception service and good contemporary rooms. Great pub adjoining hotel serving good pub grub type food. Twenty minutes walk to Temple Bar.,4,2013,02,17
248,Birthday weekend,Just returned from another great weekend staying at the camden court could not fault this hotel lovely rooms had a brilliant time beers in the bleeding horse pub next door and cassidys bar a few doors down staff were excellent food was great we will be back again its ideal. free parking and 10 mins walk to the centre of everything,5,2013,02,17
248,Musical evening with friends,"After booking an event in the National Concert Hall I was advised to check out this hotel.  I've had little experience in booking central hotels in Dublin & this is a little gem - perfect location and walking distance of the concert hall.  Rooms were clean & tidy, staff friendly and the breakfast was warm and plentiful.  I had to book and number of rooms & reservations provided me with a great deal & good email support. (we were travelling to this event)  
It's a lovely hotel with nice friendly staff including the bar staff who made hot drinks into the small hours for our group.  We are looking forward to another stay in this hotel.",5,2013,02,16
248,Adequate. Looking a bit tired.,"I have stayed here many times when visiting Dublin on business, and will continue to do so because it is convenient, comfortable enough, and has the facilities that I need. So if you want luxury, look elsewhere. If you want adequate, then this is fine. It isn't really a 4 star hotel in my view, but it priced as a 3 star hotel so I have no complaints. Breakfast is OK in terms of quality, but has the ambiance and (self) service only one step up from a service station on the motorway.",3,2013,02,14
248,Tired and in serious need of a face lift - not a 4 star hotel any longer,"Pros:
Good wifi - something that's very rare in hotels these days. Good location. Friendly staff. That's it.

Cons:
Television was old and barely working - I managed to get two channels after much clicking and frustration. Kettle could do with replacing. Window didn't completely close - there was a noticeable draft. Bath is small and shallow, so you can forget about luxuriating in a hot bath. No lap top safe, no fridge, no pen and paper - nothing you expect from a 4 star. The room was dark when I entered - the lights were not switched on in advance. The key card took multiple attempts to open the door. Table was too high and chair too low for any real work - aimed at the makeup applying crowd, not the business traveller.

All in all, what makes this hotel worth staying in is not the hotel itself, it's the location. If you're a business traveller who wants to catch up on emails or work in the evening, there are better hotels out there in Dublin for similar or lower prices. Unlikely to return. 

My ongoing quest for the ideal business traveller hotel in Dublin continues.",3,2013,02,13
248,Everything you need!,We stayed here as part of a competition win so it was actually a freebie. This is a lovely hotel with a great ambience. It has everything you need but without being pretentious. It is a 15-20 minute walk to the centre of town so the location is handy if not perfect. I would have been more than happy to pay to have stayed here and I recommend it highly,5,2013,02,13
248,"Great facilities, free parking, good pool and gym","I have stayed here a few times as a treat for a night away and to use pool an gym facilities. I like this hotel because it is a goo central location with free parking, which is something hard to find in Dublin. I would recommend keeping an eye for good rates or deals as can be overpriced sometimes so if dates are flexible then wait for a cheap rate.",5,2013,02,12
248,Very nice place to stay..,"Close to town centre and surrounded by great pubs this is a nice location.. Rooms are good  decent size and a reasonably good leisure centre.. Good room service..
TV in the room was rubbish.. can upgrade to larger LCD tvs..",4,2013,02,11
248,"++Location, Accommodation, Service & Spa - Great Value","I've stayed at the Camden court several times for both business and leisure trips.  The staff are very welcoming, front desk service is excellent.  The rooms are good traditional quality and some have been re-furbished giving quite a modern feel.  Room service is very good.  Hotel is in a good location, you can walk everywhere, within the central city district.  Grafton street shopping area is about 10-15 mins (at a reasonable walking pace). There is a nice large swimming pool, jacuzzi, steam room, gym and spa.  This area is great, changing facilities are a bit cramped and could do with a make-over but everything you need is there and the pool is lovely for a decent swim as it is bigger than many 4-5 star hotels. Breakfast is great there is plenty of choice from traditional full 'Irish' to a continental selection fish meats and cheeses. When I've stayed the chef has always been on hand too.",4,2013,02,11
248,Very Good Hotel,"We stayed here in January and we were very happy with the Hotel,good location and well priced.
We didnt eat in the Restaurant as we were eating out but it looked very nice.Rooms were of good size and very comfortable.Leisure Centre was fine and free parking was a nice touch.Would stay here again.",4,2013,02,07
248,Spacious in Dublin,"Camden Court, Lower Camden St., Dublin 2.  Once you know which way to go, it's only 500m walk from Stephens Green.
A business-style hotel, but we were there for a couple of social nights in Dublin. Very spacious lobby, reception - a bit too open for us - bar cosier.  Access throughout very easy.  Our room was excellent and so quiet that we could hardly believe we were so central to Dublin.  Dinner in the restaurant was a real pleasure.  We had decided to eat there because we were too lazy to go out and find somewhere else, but so glad we stayed - very good food indeed!  ~All staff very helpful and friendly.",4,2013,02,06
248,"Great Hotel in middle of Dublin, no one knows about......","I only had the pleasure of staying overnight for business, but I was stunned how facilities and services in hotel stand shoulder to shoulder to those classic hotels in Dublin.   One big difference is that at a very competitive 4 star price, it has a fantastic pool and leisure area, with no one in them!   Hidden in a traffic island beside the Bleeding Horse pub, I thought at least it would be noisy and I would get much sleep, quite the contrary,  I couldn't hear a thing and had a great night's sleep.   Service was excellent, and food fantastic, I will be changing to Camden Court from now on.  You should try it.",5,2013,02,04
248,A Gem,"My sister and I arrived here for an overnight stay last week - I had stayed many times before at this hotel but it was my sisters first time.  As always, the Hotel is brilliant - Room was excellent, ironing board and iron provided, hairdryer, tea and coffee making facilities, extra blankets, pillows etc etc - this Hotel has it all.  it is so convenient to Grafton Street and the Luas.  It is situated around the corner from the National Concert Hall - the staff are exceptionally nice and nothing is a bother to them.  Food in the bar is great also.  The rooms are cosy and warm and spotlessly clean - I have  nothing but good things to say about this Hotel.  My sister was completely taken with this hotel as she  has travelled somewhat and she definitley said that the Camden Court is up there for value for money, location, cleanliness and friendliness. She will definitely be back here. This hotel also has their own car park and leisure facilities.  We didn't have time to use the Spa facilities this time but we will in the future.  If you are looking for an excellent Hotel , 12 minutes walk from Grafton Street , with free car park and also a leisure facility, this is the place for you. Breakfast is brilliant also - lots of cooked food, fruit and cold cuts.   Keep up the good work Camden Court and we will definitley see you again soon.  I simply love this place.",5,2013,02,04
248,Camden Court Hotel,"Very disappointing. Horrible location. Spoiled milk at ""Irish Breakfast"". Terrible view from poorly lit room, which was supposedly ""renovated"". Dublin is awesome, but thus hotel
was terrible! Pool is okay but remember to wear a swim cap or but one.",2,2013,02,02
248,"Great location, staff always friendly and helpful","We have stayed in The Camden Court on many occasions and will continue in the future.The staff are very helpful and accomodation is clean, comfortable and always a fresh look to surroundings/decor.Location is ideal to explore St Stephens Green, Grafton Street and the Luas Tram is only a minute away for even more transport options.",5,2013,01,30
248,Excellent location,"We have just returned from a weekend visit here in the Camden court, First off this is an ideal location, it is a easy 15 mins walk into St Stephens green and Grafton Street, or you can choose to take the Luas tram, which is a 1 min walk from the hotel.  The hotel itself is clean and bright, our room was on the 6th floor it was small but with all the necessary requirements, we did request extra pillows and were told they would be sent up, however we did have to ask a few more times to get them. The house keeping staff were lovely & friendly, On the 1st day we ate lunch in the resturant, (which was a Carvery) that had to be our one major compliant about the whole weekend in the hotel, it was only 1.15pm and yet they had ran out of 3 of the selections on the menu and what we got was not too edible, (Turkey) as the Chef managed to smoother it in gravy before we knew it,  there was a selection of Sandwich's but this is not what we wanted. We ate out of the hotel on the other days, ( & with so many resturants to choose from in the area you will be spoilt for choice) expect for the breakfasts, which was nice and a good selection of both hot and cold choices, The price per person for Breakfast is €13.00 which we felt was a bit steep with the current market. We did find another place ( too Late )  that provided an all day hot breakfast with the same amount and quality of food as the hotel for 7.50 per person in the St stephens green shopping centre.
Over all we would stay here again & would recommend the hotel , but just would know not to eat here. We did use the swimming pool  &Spa facilites and the staff were lovely here as well.",4,2013,01,29
248,Great break,Stayed here in January on a girly weekend.  Had a great relaxing weekend with friends. Staff were great & good value for money for hotel in dublin.  Next time I plan trip to Dublin I will be staying in Camden court,4,2013,01,28
248,Nice hotel near city centre,"Stayed here in January for one night whilst meeting some friends in Dublin. Hotel is situated close to St. Stephen's Green and a 10/12 min walk to Grafton Street. Rooms were clean and comfortable - booked a triple and had 2 single beds plus a double. Lighting is atrocious in the bedrooms - don't expect to put on make up, dry hair, look at yourself in a mirror or find anything that has fallen outside the range of the awful lighting. 

We had breakfast included and it was good, everything you needed continental plus cooked breakfast from a buffet - however the staff in the breakfast were a bit too militant about where you could sit - we were moved 4 times. I know they probably had to set up for lunch but they could have been a bit more civil about the whole thing as there was no signs/areas cordoned off. All in all the stay was good, we got a good rate and we didn't have to spend too long in the poorly lit room as we were out and about. Would I return? Yes, if we got a good rate.",4,2013,01,23
248,Camden Court Hotel Dec 2012,I was here on my own overnight on a business trip - having never been to Dublin before.  I arrived in the late evening and the staff were extremely helpful in making sure I had everything I needed including a table in the restaurant.  I didn't take up the dinner in the restaurant as the lighting was so low I could not read and there was not a table that had better lighting.  So I had room service and it was GREAT!  It was quite cold (and wet) outside but the room temp was very comfortable.  only downside was no fridge.... I was delivering a large training course the next day in the hotel and again the staff were so helpful everything was on time and the lunch service was brilliant.  Unfortunately I had to rush to the station at the end of the day and I left my laptop charger in the training room.  The staff found it and arranged for it to be picked up ans sent back to me in the UK - now isn't that good service!  I am now making arrangements for me and my husband to return for a long weekend as it was such a nice place.,4,2013,01,17
248,Overnight stay,"I travelled with my mum, my friend and her mum for an overnight stay on 12th January 2013. We booked the hotel online and didn't really know what to expect from a 3star hotel sometimes it's hit or miss.  This is definitely a hit!  The rooms are very clean and contemporary, the reception area is very welcoming and lots of seating areas to sit and people watch, enjoy a drink and a chat and so on.  We did not have time to use the leisure facilities but really regret not as they looked fabulous.  We chose to head out for dinner despite the wonderful menu in the hotel and the reception staff were very helpful in recommending local restaurants.  I will definitely return to this hotel without a doubt and would not hesitate in recommending it to anyone!",5,2013,01,17
248,Good but the price is still high,"Stayed here in December for one night and to be honest it is about all I could afford. While the rooms are very confortable, the location is excellent (5 minutes from the main shopping area of dublin), the services good and the food in the restaurant (I only tried breakfast) more than adequate, the price is somewhat high when compared to other properties in the same location. Yes it is quieter than the Jackson Court and the Harcourt hotels around the corner but it is not much cheaper than the superior Stephens Green hotel just down the road. 

Having said that I slept soundly and enjoyed a hearty breakfast the following morning. The bar was very quiet but it was midweek and the bar staff were not the chattiest or friendliest bunch. Would recommend it for its standard and location but if you are staying for an extended stay and want value the Harrington Hall or Stephens Green or similar might also be worth a visit.",4,2013,01,17
248,Average but reasonable...,"Thought my 3 night stay over new year was a good visit and staff were really incredibly helpful and polite. However, the place itself is a bit tired hence the 'average' review.

Here are a few random thoughts:
- Staff all well trained and very helpful - 100 for attitude.
- No safe in the rooms
- No fridge in the rooms
- Room and bathroom I have was generally a bit tired.
- Location is reasonable - 5 mins to St Stephens Green and 15/20 to some downtown locations
- Good sports bar next door. Sports bar in hotel was very expensive
- Breakfast was a fairly reasonable spread with plenty of choices!
- Good plus to get overnight guest parking on-site and for free (if you leave before 
- Pool / Sauna / Steam facilities were slightly tired but poorly laid out changing room location and lack of adequate seating near pool was disappointing.

I would rate this more as a functional business hotel in a business area than a couples ideal weekend city-break hotel",3,2013,01,14
248,Fabulous!,"Can't fault the hotel. Lovely rooms, VERY comfy beds, wonderful spa facilities. Great location for walking into town and lots of eating options near by. The breakfast was excellent - lots of choice. I would definitely stay here again.",5,2013,01,13
248,As pictured...but pool/hot tub closes at 8pm,"The rooms are very much as pictured. The double bed is probably about the size of an American queen and not the 2 singles pushed together, and very comfy. Location is a bit south of town but is very easy to find and the buses run right on route. (it was 2.50Euro from the airport to the main center, and I believe it will be the same directly from the hotel to the airport.

Breakfast is 13Euro per person if your rate did not include it. The bathrooms are very nice and overall the rooms look like they were just renovated or new. Unfortunately one of the reasons we really liked this hotel is the pool and hot tub, but entry closes at 9pm on weekdays and 8pm on weekends. Overall though a good deal, very nice rooms, comfy beds, nice staff, and good location,.",4,2013,01,12
248,"Fourth visit and excellent, as always....","This is a great hotel for dublin visits. We hope it does not get too popular, so we can always be sure of a place, but it deserves special mention. It has a great restaurant, where you can dine extremely well for a reasonable cost and their stay rates are just the job for a medium budget stay with guaranteed comfort and convenience. It is a modern, clean, well-equipped hotel, with leisure centre and free car-parking. This last point is a must for tourists like us, renting a car and afraid to park on the street and without the buckets of cash required for commercial parking in this city. It is short walking distance from the main attractions of the city and is close to great places to visit, restaurants, shops and Trinity College is just ten minutes walk. 
The staff are so helpful and friendly that it is clear they are very well trained and probably constantly monitored regarding this essential element of good hospitality. We were told the owner is a Donegal man, Brian Mc Eniff, with a long track record of excellence and success in the hotel business. It shows. We have been here four times now and stayed as long as we could, to be assured of no problems during our trips to Ireland. We won't be booking anywhere else in Dublin, while they still have spaces. Well done Camden Court.",5,2013,01,10
248,Very good hotel,"I was pleasantly surprised on my first visit to the Camden Court Hotel. This hotel is clean, bright and warm with spacious rooms and the staff are top class and polite. Centrally located and beside the Harcourt Luas line stop the hotel is good value for money and my only gripe was the overly quiet bar as it is limited to residents at night and lacked atmosphere. An added bonus is that parking is free until 1pm on the day of departure. Great breakfast! ....No rating for the Spa as I did not use the facility.",4,2013,01,10
248,Great Hotel.....,Stayed in this hotel  early dec. with 2 friends had a great time and would highly recomend it.Everyone of the staff we met were excellent...Rooms very clean and well equiped...Breakfast really good choice and well presented...Pool and steam room etc good......Will certainly be back ....,5,2013,01,06
248,Lovely hotel- great value for location,"I stayed in this hotel twice in the past six months and I've only good to say. For the price it's more than what I expected. Rooms are clean and tidy ( espically if you request a renovated room). It's in walkable distance to grafton street for shopping or catch the Luas tram just a few meters from the hotel if your feeling lazy. I went to the pool during my stay and it was fine, geting a bit tattered but did the job and was clean. Nice big jacuzzi! Peeped ino the GYM and that looked great. One of the best things was the free underground secure car parking, we had stayed in city centre in a different hotel before and had paid in a car park approx 20 Euro for overnight parking. All the hotel staff we had dealings with were very professional and helpful, couldn't fault. The breakfast is worth geting, lots of choice. Lovely fresh fruit salad. One tip I would say is go in lots of time for it because they do pack up everything at the stroke of closing.",4,2013,01,05
248,nice hotel,stayed in the camden court for 4 days over the new year had a great time the hotel staff where great the rooms spotless food great close to the centre of the city will stay in this hotel again it was great value for money loved the bar and selection of cocktails and selection of beers met people from all over the word i really enjoyed my stay,4,2013,01,05
248,A little gem,"Having stayed here some 5 years ago, we could really see the improvements in the hotel and regeneration of the local area. From check in we were given first class service.nwe were given both an early/late check in/out, for free. The reception were friendly, professional and courteous at all times. Good spacious rooms, clean and modernized! Great pool and gym, no noise from outside at any point. Good bar and just the place to stay in Dublin. Surrounded by great transport links (luas and bus) and a stroll down Wexford street a must! Good wifi links and options for printing too... If you need a coffee trillions of coffee shops!",5,2013,01,05
248,Great Location,"Stayed here in June 2011 & June 2012,

Great location and food, staff are very friendly, the swimming pool is lovely and not to busy.

Would definitely go back, also there is a car park which is also handy!",5,2013,01,02
248,Great hotel,"Stayed here on NYE with friends. Lovely hotel, could not fault it in any way. Staff very friendly also. Great location & reasonably priced. Would recommend the hotel for a city break as within walking distance of shops,bars, St Stepens Green etc",5,2013,01,01
248,Pleasant Surprise,"We stayed on Saturday 29th December, when we were meeting friends from Cork and decided to stay overnight in Dublin,having booked the Camden Court on lastminute.com.
Living in Ireland, knowing where the hotel was - next to The Bleeding Horse Pub on Camden Street - I wasn't expecting much.
However, I was really surprised as the place was great. Good sized rooms, very clean, very friendly helpful staff. Bar food was good and the breakfast excellent. 
The hotel had a good pool and gym too, which some of us got to use.
I'd recommend it for a weekend in Dublin - only about 15 minutes walk from Grafton Street area.",4,2013,01,01
248,Excellant Hotel next to Bleeding Horse Pub,Great rooms at fair prices.  Right next door to the Bleeding Horse Pub that has some of the greatest food and atmosphere in Dublin.  Attentive staff and great Irish Breakfast.  There is nothing negative I can think of concerning the Camden.,5,2012,12,21
248,"Luxury hotel, good price!","The Hotel is quite close to the city center, it has a free parking amd a wonderful (complimentary) leisure center, with sauna, Jacuzzi, swimming-pool and turkish bath. Very nice the English breakfast!",5,2012,12,20
248,Camden Court Hotel Dublin,"An excellant hotel in Dublin City Centre with parking at the hotel.  LUAS stop at the back of the hotel.  A very comfortable hotel, with great food and attentive Staff.  We were there for the Christmas Party and it was the best Christmas Party that I've ever been at.",5,2012,12,16
248,Excellent stay in Dublin,"After staying in rooms resembling cupboards previously in the UK, the Camden Court was a nice surprise. Large room with corner windows, trouser press, kettle, and spacious bathroom area. I must also add the small detail that the shampoo and shower gel provided smelled divine. This hotel was well managed with LUAS stop (to St. Stephen's Green in 2 minutes) and bus stop right outiside. We had breakfast at the hotel on one the first morning. It was delicious, but for the price, we decided to venture out the next morning. Did not try out the pool or other facilities, as we were busy seeing the city and did not pack suits. We were taking a later flight out and the front desk staff offered to hold our bags for us upon check-out. This normally makes me very uncomfortable, but our bags were taken and tagged (we were given ticket stubs to retrieve later) and placed in a locked room behind the desk with a secuity code door. Very nice. Would definitely recommend and stay again.",5,2012,12,16
248,Lovely hotel great location,"Stayed here with my other half just for one night lovely hotel great location, just around the corner from stephens green. Room was really nice and cosy very clean and staff were nice. Breakfast was ok just be prepared for long queues!!! Poor chef was on his own trying to cater for everyone and there were hardly any staff, they couldn't cope with the amount of people!!!! Personally I think self service would work better and more effeciantly!!!",4,2012,12,09
248,Hot food not good,"We stayed here for a night last week.Despite its good reviews for food,we were disappointed.
We had lunch there and were served from a buffet.Everything seemed to be dried out from being kept ward.The fish was ok but everything else(particularly these potato cubes which I nearly broke a tooth on!) had dried out while it was sitting there.Disappointing.
Breakfast the same.We were down about 8,30 on a Saturday morning and found sausages,bacon all dried up from being kept warm.
It wasnt a great problem as there was plenty of cereals,yogurts and a good selection of fruit,breads and croissants but husband was looking forward to a good old fry-up that he doesnt get at home and it was abandoned.

Hotel was in a slightly seedy part of town but well served by busses and easy walking to everything.Also easy to access from canal.It would be nice if hotel put directions from South on website.

Hotel itself was very nice,rooms average.Major office partying going on when we came back from theatre but we had no disturbances in the night and couldn't have asked for a quieter room(5th floor)

All in all,I would definitely stay here again but wouldnt eat here-pleanty of eateries around.

reception staff very helpful and nice.",4,2012,12,09
248,Great hotel,"My husband and I spent our first and last nights in Ireland at this hotel and found it to be very clean and nice, the staff friendly and helpful. There is on-site free parking, which is a huge bonus in Dublin. The only drawback was finding it on the crazy unmarked streets of Dublin - GPS finds it from the wrong side of the street. 

Our first night there we stayed in a refurbished king size room which was lovely, but our last night there was a booking error and they had us in a ""family"" room with three twin beds. We asked to be moved, and since the hotel was full it took a little while to work that out, but we ended up in a room with a smaller bed and it was not yet renovated. If reserving again, I'd request a renovated room. 

Our trip included breakfast, which I believe was 13 Euros, and included a full Irish buffet breakfast as well as cold foods. We had a very early departure on our last night and they offered to put out the continental breakfast for us early and even though we declined, I thought that was a nice service.

We didn't use the pool or jacuzzi but they looked really clean and nice too.",4,2012,12,06
248,Great hotel,Reception great food great spa great clean tidy reasonable price no complaints what so ever walkable distance to temple bar Stephens green etc taxi from train station not to expensive couple of great bars and food places near by ,4,2012,12,03
248,Five star service for three star prices,"Really nice hotel only 10 min stroll from the shops, bars and eateries. Spacious and upmarket lobby area with access to onsite bar ( contemporary but cozy ) and restaurant ( looked lovely but we didn't use it ). Big double room that looked recently refurbished, very clean with table and two chairs, really nice ensuite with bath/shower combo, lots of hanging space ( but take some extra hangers if you're planning to stay a few days ) and iron, ironing board and trouser press plus the usual tea & coffee facilities and flat screen ctv. Free use of multigym and spa, decent pool, jacuzzi, sauna and steam room. Friendly and efficient reception, all round great three day stay.
Fantastic traditional pub next door called ""The Bleeding Horse"". Really loved my first visit to Dublin, my wife has been twice before, and look foreward to returning and will definately stay at The Camden Court again.",5,2012,11,28
248,Couldn't have asked for more.,"Although I live in Dublin, there was a small group of us staying here for a function in the City Centre and I was really pleasantly surprised with The Camden Court Hotel. 

Location wise it's great, close enough to the City Centre to make it only a quick leisurely stroll away & take in the sights of some of Dublin's most underrated streets, Camden St, Wexford St, and Georges St. 

I found the staff to be extremely helpful and polite and I couldn't fault them at all. In regards to the room, it was warm, comfortable and pretty spacious and excellent value for money, so, again, no complaints. Plus the 12pm check out is a real added bonus.

They also put on one of the best hotel breakfast spreads I've ever seen. Great value for money at only €13 (€10 if you book it at check-in). It has everything from healthy fresh fruits, yogurts, juices and porridge all the way to the hearty Irish fry. Excellent!

I think where The Camden Court really wins points is in the fact that they provide all the little extras that most hotels charge for like free Wi-Fi, parking and a late check out. It's incredibly good value for money and certainly a lot better than other ""prestigious"" hotels at almost double the price. 

Well done to everyone in the hotel, I will most certainly be recommending it!",5,2012,11,26
248,Excellent service,I chose this hotel to be near a relative who was in hospital. It was just a ten minute walk to Grafton Street and right next to a Luas. The staff were very friendly and helpful and when I checked out a day early the manager was kind enough to credit my account even though I was quite late checking out. The room was really comfortable with all the facilities and was very clean. Food is served quite late in the bar which is unusual. The menu was varied and good value for money. I will be back.,5,2012,11,25
248,Great experience,"We stayed at Camden Courts during the first week of November 2012.  The staff was very friendly and professional. The motel was clean and maintained in good order.  We asked for a quiet and remodeled room when we booked this and that request was respected.  The pool and spa area is an extra bonus.  Very comfortable lobby should you wish to meet your friends or family to visit. We did not choose to use the hotel pub or restaurant. There are several pubs, eating establishments and small convenience stores very close to the property.  Busy and safe location.  Without a doubt we would stay here again.",5,2012,11,25
248,Good Hotel- But So Hot!,"We stayed at the Camden Court in November for a 5 day break. The hotel is well located with the LUAS (tram) just around the corner and a bus stop just outside, so all of Dublin is easily acessible. The rooms are modern and well kept. The only down side is that the rooms and hotel in general were kept so warm all the time! We were on the 4th floor and were constantly having to open a window, and as the hotel is on quite a busy street I didn't always have the best nights sleep. On a positive note the beds were very comfortable The spa facilities are good, although looking their age. The swimming cap for the pools is a bit of a rip off tho. Also be prepared as the ladies changing rooms have no cubicles.",4,2012,11,23
248,Great hotel for a conference,"I cannot praise this hotel enough. I helped to organise a large conference at  and the staff were so helpful. The meeting rooms are excellent and can be adapted to suit your own business needs. Nothing is too much trouble for the staff.

The Meeting Excellence Manager deserves her name. All requests were met with a smile and dealt with promptly and efficiently.  The whole week went without a hitch.

The hotel bedrooms have been  tastefully refurbished recently and the bed was so comfortable. The hotel also boasts a health and fitness suite and an indoor swimming pool which I used. The facilities were clean and it was an enjoyable experience.

The lunches at the Camden Court are fantastic. Good quality, healthy food - not a chip in sight. There is so much choice and great portion sizes. I loved the food.

The hotel is perfectly situated in central Dublin a 5 minute walk from Grafton Street and St Stephens Green.

If you want a memorable stay in Dublin choose the Camden Court Hotel - it is great.",5,2012,11,21
248,Excellent Dublin hotel,"My wife and I spent 2 nights here in October.  This is the second time we have stayed here and will do again!  The hotel and it's facilities are excellent.  The room was clean, spacious and well furnished, and all at a reasonable price.  The sumptious breakfast set us up for the day.  Well situated for central Dublin, with Temple bar a 15 minutes walk away.",5,2012,11,20
248,Good prize and good quality,"I spent two nights in the hotel and everything was correct. The room was big and very clean. The bed sheets were the softest that I've ever slept. The location is perfect, 5min to Saint Stephen's Green and 10 to Trinity Collegue.

I recommend going to this hotel",4,2012,11,18
248,Amazing place,"We stayed here our last night in Ireland..
It was within walking distance of Temple bar area and it was a great last night spent in this 
wonderful country.. 
We had our farewell banquet here and it was great food..
Would recommend..",5,2012,11,18
248,Good hotel for quick getaway in Dublin,"In town, but still away from Temple bar stress, lies this good ""value for money"" hotel. A bit run down room (some) perhaps, thin walls/doors and the funniest elevator voice ever, but close to everything (incl St Stephens park), ok pool, fine bar/restaurant and friendly staff makes it a good start for a quick Dublin getaway. Very few parking lots though, if you're driving there.
Will for sure go back here, totally ok!",4,2012,11,13
248,Perfect Hotel Perfect Location,"Very impressed with this hotel, ideally located in Dublin near excellent pubs, shops and restaurants. Lovely comfortable hotel with a great breakfast. Free wifi, a leisure centre and hotel parking which is sometimes difficult to get in a city centre hotel, would highly recommend this hotel",5,2012,11,11
248,Smart Clean Modern Hotel,"My wife bought us a four night stay in Dublin for our anniversary. She chose the Camden Court Hotel, and  a good choice it was too. We were on the 6th floor, so it was nice and quiet and the rooms seem to have been refurbished fairly recently. The hotel has a fitness centre and a really nice swimming pool in the basement. About 20 minutes walk to most of what is going on in the area. A bit longer if you want to go over the river. Notices in the rooms tell you there is an ice machine on the 4th floor, but when you come out of the lift, it's a Coca Cola machine. But don't be fooled, turn left to where the rooms are and a short walk down the corridor reveals the ice machine, positioned in an alcove so you can't see it readily. Was directed to it by the friendly staff when I moaned about there not being one.

Bar and bar food were of a good standard. Didn't have the breakasts, seemed a little expensive and the cosy bed kept us from getting up early.  Would visit Camden Court Hotel again.",4,2012,11,11
248,"comfortable, friendly, will be back!","a friend and I stayed in Camden court hotel for three nights last week. we arrived around 9 in the morning on the first day, were both tired after a lot of travelling so thought we would see if we could leave luggage until check in time at 2pm. fortunately the hotel let us check in early around 9.30 which was brilliant as we weren't expecting it. staff were so friendly on arrival we couldn't have had a warmer welcome. our twin room was lovely, clean, warm. great shower/bath. it was great to come home after each day to fresh towels and made beds. the hotel is a short 10 minute walk from Grafton street (it really is short) but far enough away to be out of the loud bustle of the centre of Dublin. Dublin is a lovely city and without gushing has the friendliest and most helpful people out of all the places I have been. the food in the restaurant was delicious and worth the price. we made good use of the fantastic pool and health suite facilities after a hard days site seeing. staff were all so helpful and we really felt their personalities were kind and caring which is a great thing as in some hotels staff can be clinical and cold. anyway I could talk about it all day but the point is we had a fantastic holiday and a lot of that is due to the fantastic staff and facilities at Camden court hotel. we will be back time Dublin and we will definitely be staying at this hotel. :)",5,2012,11,11
248,5 star,"Great location, comfy rooms, pleasant staff, brilliant residents bar - lol!
And Mmmmn hash browns for breakfast, and beans  - Will come again.  xx  Get good directions from someone , not like one of ny co-drivers     !!!!",5,2012,11,10
248,Cracking hotel in Dublin City,"We stayed at the Camden Court whilst down at the Dublin Marathon. For this it was perfect, not too far from Stephens Green and with faciities which put many 4 Star hotels to shame. For those looking a nice Guiness and pub grub, the adjoining bar next door, The Bleeding Horse, is a great little watering hole.  Hotel Staff are welcoming and helpful. Parking is free and wifi is free also. Too many hotels now are ripping people off with these  charges which all add up on wee breaks. Credit to the Camden for providing a great comfortable hotel, in a great location, and at reasonable rates for what you get. We shall definitely return and have recommended the hotel to many friends.",5,2012,11,07
248,Great Dublin experience.,"We followed the hotels instructions from their website and found this hotel easily and cheaply by catching the air coach from the airport. As we arrived, we were impressed by the friendliness of the hotel staff. They gave us all the information we needed. Our room was on the 6 th floor, a double, with the comfiest bed ever. The room was really clean and had lots of storage space with an iron and ironing board in the wardrobe. At night we didn't hear any noise which is always a bonus. The Irish breakfast was buffet style and was lovely. The overall feel of the hotel during our stay was relaxed and warm. We didn't use the spa facilities but this was something that made us choose this hotel in the first place, maybe next time we'll go down there. The hotel is in a good area and the pub next door is busy and has a great atmosphere. There are a resturaunts on the door step and taxi's galore. It isn't in the busiest part of the city, but we liked to walk into the busy bits then walk back. I would say to anyone to book this hotel as it's been a great experience for us. Well done to the Camden Court Hotel.",4,2012,11,05
248,Good central Dublin hotel,"The hotel is large, clean, modern and commercial.  The rooms are small, functional and for a 3 star quite adequate.  Room rates reflect the fact that it is quite central but also only a 3*.  We paid €89 for a double room B&B.    The other guests in November were all international travellers; I lost count of the number of different languages spoken at breakfast.  Breakfast was quite good: fresh fruit, breads etc… and a cooked Irish breakfast as well.  
The hotel is just outside the tourist centre of the city, 5 minutes St. Stephens Green, 7 minutes’ walk to Grafton Street (shopping).  It is minutes from the tram (LUAS) serving the South of Dublin (Dundrum ctr.) and 15 minutes’ walk to Dublin Castle.  There is free parking.  We got a space, there did not seem to be a lot of spaces, but there was a sign to an overflow car park.  
In this category close by is the Drury Court – this hotel is nicer than the Drury Court (rooms, breakfast, everything), but the Drury Court is right in the centre of things and only 5 minutes’ walk from the Camden Court.",4,2012,11,05
248,Frequent visitor,"Firstly, to be clear about it - this is not a luxury hotel. it is cheap and cheerful, and its biggest selling point (apart from price) is the central location. Rooms are very plain but clean, breakfast is ok and the staff are helpful. I have stayed here regularly over the years and if you're on a budget it's a good place to be based from while in Dublin city center.",4,2012,11,03
248,Fantastic Dublin location,"Just returned from 6 days at this hotel 28/10 - 2/11, and must write to congratulate the Camden Court for such excellent service received during our stay.

the hotel is situated in a quiet location on Camden street a short walk from Grafton street (7 - 10 mins), to be honest the walk was nice and could be done quicker at a brisker pace!

the hotel was very plush particularly for a 3* and had very friendly attentive staff in all areas, and was very nicely furnished with rich wood and marble.

the Iveagh restaurant was a nice setting and served a lovely buffet breakfast (not self service for the hot breakfast, but served for you by a Chef) this was not a problem as you could ask for as much or little as you wanted,  the quality of the food was excellent.

we had dinner in the restaurant one evening and that was beautiful also.

we had room 526 which was one of the refurbished rooms and we could not have wanted for better, the room was at the rear of the hotel overlooking the car park, and was quite peaceful , although my wife did complain of some noise in the corridors on a couple of evenings !it did not affect me as i am hard of hearing!

the c central bar was very inviting and had great staff, you will get confused with the twins that serve there though!! great drinks and food served here in a very relaxing sumptious enviroment.     

lastly, the spa is of an excellent standard also, and i thoroughly enjoyed my early mornings here meeting some locals for an early morning chat whilst enjoying the sauna, steam room and jaqussi after a nice swim.

to re cap if you are thinking of a stay in Dublin, i cannot commend this hotel enough, the location, quality, and service.

don't forget to visit the Bleeding Horse pub which is next door, and reputed to be 360 years old!",5,2012,11,02
248,Farrer's Two Day Break for 65th Birthday,My husband and I recently stayed at the Camden Court and received excellent service. Room had a king size bed and overall plenty of room.  Within walking distance of the National Concert Hall.  Celebratory meal in the restaurant and very impressed.  More so when we were leaving and sitting in the foyer one of the waiters came over to us to wish us well - personal service means a great deal and for him to remember us was a great feeling.,5,2012,11,02
248,Great Hotel,Stayed in Camden Court for weekend of Dublin marathon and very satisfied   staff all very pleasant and helpful   food excellent   great buffet for breakfast with huge choice  had dinner in hotel on first night from special runners menu which was excellent value and delicious      hotel location great  and free parking added bonus for city accommodation    would definitely stay here again,5,2012,11,01
248,Capable of so much more and bring earplugs,"I wanted to give this hotel more but it came up short several times.

As everyone else has stated the location is great. Right beside the LUAS or a short walk to town (but not great for the airport buses) We were in a disabled room (on the 4th floor!) so it was a bit bigger than others we saw. Overall appearances were good, decent decor and clean, etc. Spa facilities were good but if you are using the pool bring a cap or be charged 2,50 for something from the victorian era.

That said its one of the noisiest places I've ever stayed. Be prepared for a steady stream of revellers returning home at 3am then continuing the party til whenever. We saw several people smoking out of the windows meaning that our room then smelled of smoke even with the window shut: hotel staff seemed unconcerned at either of these issues.
Only had the cooked breakfast once and it was cold.

You could stay here and get lucky, then again you might not. I've had better for the money, in fact, I've had better for less.",3,2012,11,01
248,"Great location, and baby friendly as well","I stayed for 2 nights with my 7 month old son. The location was excellent and the directions given on the web site made it really easy to find (despite the best efforts of my upside down google maps!).  
Having read other reviews, I was concerned about noise, but I can honestly say we didn't find this an issue even with having a room overlooking the main road. 
With having a young baby with me I was concerning about the availability of facitities to sterilise bottles, but the staff in the resturant sorted this for me with no hassle.
We used the pool twice and found the changing room very cold the first time, and when we said this at the spa reception the 2nd time they kindly turned the heating up a bit for us.
Overall we found this a good value extremely comfortable hotel in a central location and would definitely recommend it to friends and family.",5,2012,10,31
248,Good Location for City Center Activites,"We only stayed here for one night, but it was a good choice.  We arrived in the afternoon, checked in and walked to St. Patrick's Cathedral, Temple Bar, Trinity College, and Dublin Castle.  The hotel itself was clean, well maintained, and overall an excellent choice.  Parking in the garage was an added bonus so you don't have to worry about trying to find a spot on the street.  It is a very nice hotel for the price.  We do recommend this hotel if you want to do activities in the city center.",4,2012,10,29
248,Good City Centre hotel,"I attended a conventionin the hotel recently and the facilities and staff were very good indeed.  
Couple of things worth noting though.
There are no net curtains on the windows. So don't, like me, throw the curtains open in the morning unless you are fully dressed or you want to give people outside a treat/shock.
The breakfast,which is excellent in every other way, does not have any black pudding - what's that about!",4,2012,10,19
248,Good Hotel,"Stayed here as part of a tour.
My room overlooked where the buses stayed over night. It was therefore noisy and since the smoking area was there also, I was able to smell the smoke.
The staff was friendly and very helpful.
The room was clean.
Finding the hair dryer was a challenge.
The hotel was walking distance from a major shopping area and Trinity College.
would recommend this hotel. The pub attached to the hotel had a nice menu with good value.",3,2012,10,17
248,First time visitors to Dublin. Been wance wid go again.,"My wife and I visited Dublin recently and stayed at the Camden Court Hotel on a 3 night's BB basis. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay and would definitely stay there again. Although the hotel is a couple of miles from the city centre, the public transport system in Dublin is excellent and bus stops for the hotel are only 100 yards away. So travel to and from the hotel is very easy. We purchased the, 3 day Freedom pass, from the Travel Information desk at the airport for  28 euros. This was an excellent purchase and we used the ticket constantly, especially the hop on/ hop off bus which takes tourists to all Dublin's major attractions. As for the hotel. First impressions were favourable. There is a large foyer in the hotel with the reception desk to the left. The girl at the desk was very helpful and courteous and even though we arrived very early, at 10 0'clock, our room was ready. The lifts to our floor were only a few steps from the desk and they worked very efficiently. We were staying on floor 6, room 4 and we were in our room in less than a minute after pressing the lift button. So there was no waiting ages for the lift. The room was very clean, spacious, had good decor and furniture, a television and a large comfortable bed. The bathroom was spacious with an excellent shower. This floor was very quiet, day and night, so it suited my wife and I perfectly. Breakfast was a typical hot and cold buffet in an excellent, spacious dining room. The usual fare was on offer, which was, fruit juices, fruit, cereal, tea and toast, pastries/ croissants and the usual hot breakfast food. The staff was minimal but very helpful. We had a few drinks in the hotel, during our stay, and the prices were reasonable in comparison to Dublin prices. I used the swimming pool and jacuzzi and once again, enjoyed the facilities. The receptionist booked an early morning call for us, to waken us on our last morning at the hotel. She also booked a taxi for our journey back to the hotel. This was the usual, excellent level of service the staff gave us during our 3 night stay. Our only criticism? The central heating system needs attention. It didn't matter whether we turned the radiator in our room, off or on, it was still very noisy. It was quite infuriating at 6 0'clock in the morning being wakened by a gurgling radiator. Time to get the toon plumber in I think. In conclusion, we thoroughly enjoyed our stay. The staff was very courteous and helpful, the room was fine as was the facilities and the breakfast was excellent. Location wasn't a problem due to the excellent bus service and there is always the option of a taxi. Finally, the Jewel in the Crown. Dublin. What a wonderful city it is. So much to see, so much to do and lovely Irish people. We visited the Guinness Storehouse, Kilmainan Jail, Jameson's Distillery, the River Finney Cruise and the Arlington Hotel for the Irish music and dancing show. The hop on/ hop off bus drops you off at all these attractions. So we had a fantastic holiday.",4,2012,10,17
248,Great Location - Good Value,"Ideal spot if wanting to stay in central Dublin.  The room was a standard size - be sure to request a room to the back of the hotel away from the tour buses at the front loading up at 6.30am.  Breakfast was excellent - exceed my expectation.  Full cooked breakfast, fresh crossiants/bread, youghurts were organic and Irish - Fresh Fruit and an array of breakfast cereals.  There definitely was something to suit everyone.",4,2012,10,16
248,Good value for Dublin,"Although the rooms were standard, and the location was fair, we enjoyed the walk to most of the sights in Dublin.  The hotel was clean and the staff very helpful (we arrived at 10am and our room was ready and we were able to check in!).  The breakfast was fair, but standard.  Parking was very easy right at the hotel.  All in all the price was right for a nice, clean hotel in downtown Dublin.",4,2012,10,14
248,Over night stay,hotel is in a good location with free parking. Rooms are adequate love the mirrors. the hotel is clean and staff friendly.  Good breakfast with plenty of choice.  Leisure facilities are are fit for purpose. Have stayed there before and would stay again.,4,2012,10,14
248,"Reasonable hotel, at a reasonable price.  Nothing special","Hotel is approx. 10-15 minute walk to town centre, so not too far.  Room was average, well-maintained, and clean.  Quite a bit of noise coming from the street below, however.  We couldn't keep the window open at night due to the noise.  Pool facilities are in the basement, not a very pleasant atmosphere.",3,2012,10,10
248,A great hotel for business groups,"The best thing about this hotel is its location - really central to walk out and enjoy the experience of Dublin - some might complain about the distance but I love walking and it took me just under 10 minutes to get to Grafton Street.  Because I was on a business trip I did not get a chance to use the leisure facilities.  My Irish colleagues commented on the excellent parking (I came straight from the airport).

Check-in was great, but I have rated the room average as there was a faint smell of cigarette smoke when I first entered. When I called reception they said that smoking was not permitted in the rooms, but it sometimes happened.  They said they would call me back about another room, but didn't.   That aside it was a great room, although I would have expected air-conditoning and had to sleep with the window slightly ajar. Good sleep though.

The breakfasts were excellent and the lunch deal for soup and (made-to-order) sandwich was great value.  The dinner served to the group of us was of a higher standard than we usually get (and we meet at hotels all around Europe).  Despite the restaurant being full that night, the service from the staff was friendly, helpful and efficient.  

The hotel offered free Wifi but a lot of the group had problems logging on.  Because it was BTOpenzone I was able to use my UK account and so had no difficulty getting online.  When it was time to print my boarding pass, the receptionist said that it was not possible to print my boarding pass from my memory stick as it could have a virus (I travel frequently all over the world and have never had a problem printing my boarding pass at a hotel reception before).  I was asked to use the Lobby Computer which was being used by someone else.  When I complained, the receptionist suggested that I email her the boarding pass, which I did.  She then printed it and brought it to me.

At the end of the stay I checked out and was able to leave my bags in the luggage room for a few hours while exploring the city.  When I got back they called a taxi for me which came within 5 minutes.  Overall a functional inner city hotel which represents good value for what they charged for the room and breakfats rate - although I was on a group deal.",4,2012,10,10
248,basic,"This hotel has possibilities but you get the idea they are skimping on things. We stayed 3 nights and never got a second mini bsar of soap. The hair dryer was not that great, but almost impossible to use since it was mounted in the desk drawer with a short cord. No conciege services and mediocre front desk help. Drinks in the bar were spendy. It's a looonggg way to walk to Temple Bar area, or Trinity College, or The Guiness Storehouse, or Jameson's, or pretty much anything. The Bloody Horse next door is a good pub...otherwise the area is a bit tacky. Free car parking was nice.",3,2012,10,10
248,"Really nice hotel, nice big room and good bed!","Stayed here for four nights, with my boyfriend. Really nice hotel, rooms really clean and big. Hotel lobby is really well presented. We didn't choose to have breakfast at the hotel as we like to have breakfast at different cafes, but we had a drink at the hotel bar one eve and that was ok. We used the spa and jacuzzi for free too. Which was nice and relaxing. Also the hotel is at the bottom of a good street for eating out, a few nice noodle and Thai places that are cheaper than the Tempe bar area in town. But still in walking distance of all this. Also u can get a bus to the airport from right outside hotel for 2.70 euro which is good. ",5,2012,10,09
248,Visit to Dublin,"The hotel is quite nice.  The staff at the front desk, while efficient and willing to help, seemed a little ""distant"" compared to those we'd encountered in Western Ireland.  Maybe a big city thing but they didn't have that Irish warmth we'd come to expect.  Meals were good--but not excellent in most cases.  The room was very clean and the bed was exceptionally comfortable.  Because the heat was on until 10:00 p.m., I asked for a fan to be brought up.   It didn't arrive.  I was forced to open the windows and then heard the loud conversations down below.  A fan would have helped a lot.  One hotel in which we stayed had fans in the room.  That would have been nice.  The computer was the only one I encountered that required a payment.  It would have been nice if it had been free.  Other places we stayed had no charge.  Although I couldn't tell it, the tour guide said we stayed there because of its excellent location.  We were only there two nights and returned to the states from there early on the 3rd day so I didn't have much opportunity to find out--they took us on the bus on a city tour and dropped us at Trinity College.  We found the hotel to be very pleasant with those few comments or suggestions above.  Would recommend it but wouldn't recommend the location of my room if you want the windows to be open.  It also is right by the elevator and the doors going into the hallway were right by my room.  Could hear it until I went to sleep.  Convenient though as I have some knee problems and it was nice to be just a step from the elevator.  Also, great to have ice machine on my floor!  Could refill ice bag easily.  The pool area has a very low ceiling and so seemed like it was small.  The pool area was nice but had kind of a crowded feeling due to the low ceiling.  Would recommend it though.  Water was on the cool side but not too much so.  Enjoyed it.",4,2012,10,08
248,Perfect Weekend Stay,Me and my girlfriend stayed here last weekend.  I have stayed in Dublin quite a bit but this is by far the best hotel ive stayed in down there.  The hotel is in a perfect location with a free gym and spa along with free car parking.  The breakfast was delicious and i must say the reception staff were excellent even allowing us to book in early.  As i said the hotel is in a great location with a bar next door and a tesco express across the road and is 5 mins walk from grafton street.  Will stay here for the considerable future in Dublin when visiting.,5,2012,10,08
248,Impressive,"Ok firstly to get there you  need to take the airbus which is the quickest method and get dropped off at either Stephen Green or Lower Leeson street. Do make sure you have a map as it is easy to get lost.  If however you are in Graffton street its a straight 10 minute walk up to the hotel near a pub called the hungry horse which offers all the sky sports and nice food too.
The hotel staff couldn't do enough for me and changed my room from double to twin as I was let down by a partner so took a friend instead. Room was ready and very clean. Nice shower and bathroom. Tea/coffee making facilities.. very comfortable beds... plenty of room. Leisure facility was excellent best I have seen in ages... good cardio area and a nice 18mtr pool and jacuzzi... good changing areas and secure lockers. Just make sure you bring a swim hat but can see the reason for that and quite agree I don't want to swallow hair from someone else..
Reception and bar area are delightful and very cozy with a lovely conference centre.. Didn't hear much noise from the street either. Breakfast was full Irish but so much food and choice and nicely presented and good quality. Staff in all areas were very pleasant and helpful.. Bit lacking in entertainment but you do have the pub next door and the city centre. Taxis can take you there and buses just outside even a tram. Would definately go back there it was a very enjoyable experience.",5,2012,10,08
248,Great Staff,"Just returned from a five day stay in Dublin, hard to choose the most suitable hotel, but we`re so glad we picked The Camden Court. 
 To address a couple of issues raised by previous writers. I was really disappointed when I saw our room as is was very dated. We later found out that the rooms are being refurbished, you just have to ask for one of these rooms. I hope this involves new baths as the currant ones are so shallow its like trying to have a soak in a puddle, and they can be quite tricky to get out of. Having said that, the rooms are as clean as you could wish for and have everything you need.
 We had our window wide open all night, and it is noisy, but this is the centre of Dublin, city centers throughout the world are never quiet, and they like a drink in Dublin.
 Two of the best things about this hotel are the staff  and the food. The staff are professional, helpful and friendly, they helped make our stay more enjoyable. Secondly, the food is sublime. We ate in the restaurant a lot and can highly recomend it.  
 This hotel is within walking distance of everything you`ll want to see in the city centre.  There are posher areas to stay , but we will definately be returning to the Camden Court.",4,2012,10,07
248,Irish Yin and Yang - but  Very Good !,"Funny people the Irish and funny hotel - but overall very good. This is a large centrally placed tourist and business oriented hotel about 15 minute walk straight down to the river and Temple bar area very convenient for meetings and conventions (15 minute cab to the convention centre in the docklands). The funny thing is how they have so much right and some things funnily wrong - but overall I would rate the stay as very positive. And the price is right. Here are the Yins and the Yangs : really nicely refurbished rooms - spacious, very good beds, very quiet (espc if you ask for a back courtyard room); excellent bathrooms, all nicely done -- but no heat (yet) - they left in an old steam heat rad system - and on October 3 it didn't come on until 6 pm ! ? They gladly rolled in an electric space heater in 30 second and the room was ok without it, but ???? why.  Terrific top class large pool and health centre with great large steam and sauna and whirlpool - amazing for this price and no extra charge - but they have very cheap ghastly blue ruber mats all over to prevent slippage (good idea but why the ghastly blue ?). Very nice lobby wonderfully large and complete and new breakfast room - but corridors except for the furnished rooms above are faded red cheap carpets with big bulbous Coke machines in front of the elevators like a cheap tourist hotel - again the yang vs the yin. And finally the front desk : wonderfully warm and helpful people but for 2 nights I ordered a cab and they didn't arrive which was met with a shrug whereas there was a full taxi rank right outside they could have told me about. And then the kicker - at one in the morning with 2 attendants at the desk not a single one could tell me definitively where the convention centre was or what direction  the airport was from the hotel : let's leave it that like many service workers in Dublin they were NOT from Ireland. However even the night supervisor (also not from Ireland) didn't know for sure. What does this mean : terrific hotel which has gone upscale, great price but needs more attention to detail AND staff training to get things really right.  Overall no complaints - these are just helpful suggestions. If you are going to upgrade, well, finish the job and you'll be fine.",4,2012,10,05
248,Great place,"Have stayed there numerous times over the years. Great location, busy lively street to go out in, much prefer this to Temple bar area. Nice leisure facilities(although gym a little small), staff are very polite and helpful. I have stayed in numerous hotels in dublin over the years, and would have to stay for a normal run of the mill visit to dublin, then I recommend this hotel. The carpark is under hotel also. The pub grub is ok and its a nice layout to watch a match ect. The restaurant also is above average but there is a dearth of places to eat all around that area (few restaurants and all the usual fast food outlets).",4,2012,10,05
248,Not So Great,"It has free parking- which is good.

However, the rooms are very outdated.  They run on the warm side which would be okay if the windows could be left open.  There is SO much drunken noise from the street all night long (singing, chanting, yelling, etc.) that there is no way of getting a decent night's sleep.  Expect to be woken up at all hours- we were kept up all night on a SUNDAY.  I know the hotel can't control folks who pass by, but I will NEVER stay there again due to the noise factor.",2,2012,10,03
248,Great base (and free parking!) for visiting Dublin!,"We booked this hotel as a same-day last minute online deal for a very decent price. It served as a great base for our last night back in Dublin before we had to fly back home. It is within about 10-minute walking distance of most of the main Dublin attractions (shops, bars, St. Stephen's Green, Trinity college, etc.), rooms are clean, cozy and comfortable, the staff was very friendly and best of all, free wifi and indoor parking included in the rate! From my research, finding a hotel in downtown Dublin that doesn't charge extra for parking appears to be a rarity. Overall, a very positive experience.",4,2012,10,02
248,Couldnt fault this hotel!!!,"Have to say brilliant hotel, great staff, friendly, couldnt fault it! Stayed weekend past, great location, close to St Stephens Green, 5 mins walk. The rooms look exactly like the website, clean fresh, not a single complaint at all! If I go back to Dublin I wont be looking to stay anywhere else :-)",5,2012,10,02
248,Older but well cared for hotel.,"We enjoyed our time at the Camden. The staff at the desk were polite and helpful. We were exhausted when we arrived since we had flown through the night. The staff saw us nodding off in the lobby and quickly got us into a room even though we had checked in early in the morning. 

We were within walking distance to several parks and sites in Dublin. The Bleeding Horse pub next door is a must stop. Great beef pie and bangers & mash. ",4,2012,10,01
248,Adequate,"We were booked in here with our tour group on the weekend of the All Ireland Gaelic Football championships.  The hotel turned out to be the headquarters for the Donnegal fans, which made for an exciting and fun stay.  Overall, the hotel is only average: smallish rooms, a bit worn, and not in the nicest part of town.  But it was adequate, with efficient and friendly staff, a very nice breakfast, nice in-house bar, and within walking distance of St. Steven's Square, the University and the major museums.  Upon our return to Dublin, we looked elsewhere.",3,2012,10,01
248,Excellent hotel and location.,"Friendly staff, really good value for money, brilliant location within walking distance of Temple bar and St Stephens green area. Also ideally located for LUAS and buses.
Wish we had booked for longer will definitely return!!",5,2012,10,01
248,Great staff,We had to check out of another Hotel .........and the Camden hotel was a very welcome relief. Good location ........and a great pub next door with lots of taxi service. We could walk to all of the locations that we were interested.... one of the the best values compared to other Hotels options was the free parking in a very secured parking lot. Breakfast was not included but the parking was worth that minor inconvenience. Good coffee bar as well.,4,2012,09,30
248,Great hotel just out of city centre on public transport line,"This is a lovely hotel, great food, professional, great location, public transport just a step away, good sized rooms, safe parking  & sophisticated. A health centre included & reasonably price I would highly recommend it ",5,2012,09,27
248,Good central location,"I have stayed here several times now and have just booked again. The Camden court is in a good location, it takes just a few minutes to walk to St Stephens Green, Dawson Street and Grafton, this covers all of your social needs, good restaurants, good bars and good shopping without getting mugged in Temple bar. The Hotel is clean, good décor, reasonably priced, rooms are comfortable ( main corridors can be noisy late at night) and has free parking. I'm a business traveller so free fast internet is good, good fast and early breakfast ( evening food is OK if your not going out) and a bar ! are all essential. Definitely will use regularly.",4,2012,09,26
248,Great Location & Super Breakfast,"We stayed at the Camden Court over the All Ireland Weekend. Great location (so easy to get to) and also great complimentary parking. Bedrooms were recently refurbished and very comfortable. Breakfast was excellent with a super choice and very impressive hot buffet.
Very friendly staff and very corteous and efficient management. (Didnt have time to use the leisure facilities)
Would definately return next time we are heading for Dublin!",5,2012,09,26
248,Camden Court Family Trip,"We recently stayed here for 3 nights with our traveling group of nine, including 3 little boys.
This a very nice hotel for families as they have a nice breakfast buffet, a wonderful pool, and location close to the nice playground in St. Stephen's Green. Within walking distance was the tour bus stop, Grafton Street, shopping, grocery stores, atms, Trinity College, restaurants, and other attractions",4,2012,09,25
248,Good value hotel in great location,"I have stayed in the Camden Court Hotel for both business and holiday. The hotel is good value and is conveniently located. Stephen's Green is a fast 5 minute walk. Plus points of the hotel: Free and plentiful secure parking, friendly and efficient staff, good quality rooms (but make sure you get a refurbished one), nice swimming pool & good breakfasts. Minus point: Gym is very basic and hotel bar is nothing special (go into the Bleeding Horse Bar which is attached to hotel)",4,2012,09,24
248,Excellent hotel,"Superb hotel tucked away out of the hustle and bustle! On-sote parking is extremely convenient, and the swimming pool and leisure facilites were sooooo relaxing :-) Room was very spacios and comfortable and to block out the noises from ouside... shut the windows!!! Fabulous dinner at the restaurant with great portions and choice. Would definitely stay again!

Oh and I watched that bus parking from the reviewer on 20th... very impressive driving skills :-)",5,2012,09,24
248,"Not a Four *, nice location","We were placed at this hotel recently as part of a trip plan. There is free parking, LOTS OF STREET NOISE, small details missing. We were assigned to a noisy room which could not be changed the first night. Hotel is clean most room re-done recently. Breakfast nice and nicely served. Two very good dinners at restuarants in walking distance, Green 19 and Camden Kitchen. Both are friendly, good food and nice atmosphere...Camden Kitchen a little more upscale. Tghere's a Tesco for food items one block away, 10 minute walk to HOHO bus at ST Stephen's Square. I would rate a 3*+ but would not stay again because of street noise and no air conditioning. Hotel packed with American tourists",3,2012,09,23
248,Downtown and comfortable,"Two nights in this better than average city traveler's hotel were fine. Decent rooms and an above average breakfast made this a value for money stay. The hotel staff were friendly and competent.
As a result, we enjoyed our visit to Dublin, in spite of a steady rain and very cool temperatures-this was in July 2012, 

The most amazing thing was watching our very entertaining tour bus driver manuever our giant tour bus into the ridiculously small and awkward parking area designated for bus parking. -Twice-as we used this vehicle to transport all 40+ Virginia Choral Society travelers on a city tour and then on to our two week Ireland and Scotland Tour 2012. It was a good start to a really fine experience.",4,2012,09,19
248,Camden Court Hotel,"Myself & my husband stayed here as all the other hotels in Dublin seemed to be booked out. Leonard Cohn & Lady Gaga were in town and Dublin was jammed. It was expensive for a Double room - more of a Travelodge type hotel than premium. The room was small but clean. The bathroon was a good size but the water pressure in the shower left alot to be desired. Camden street is packed with late night bars and clubs so good for a particular generation. The hotel is about 15 minutes walk from Grafton street - the centre of the shopping district in Dublin. I wouldn't recommend walking around the area at night but during the day was perfectly fine. All in all I would suggest this hotels to 20/ 30's somethings in large groups vising Dublin for the weekend. For the more discerning traveller it would be hell on wheels. The icing on the cake was that we exited the room at 12.15pm (Check-out was 12.00) and we had been phoned, the door banged on and we were told off like naughty school children as checked out at reception - it all ended rather badly.",2,2012,09,19
248,maybe it was not a good weekend for them..,"we were in Dublin during the Notre Dame - Navy football weekend.   And rooms were at a minimum and we were with a very large group (88) on a tour.   THings were disappointing from the twin beds ( for a married couple??) and the run down furnishings and carpet.  But when the phone didn't work, and the window didn't open ( no air conditioning) and the TV didn't work  it couldn't get much worse.  Thank goodness for a fabulous housekeeper... jack of all trades... fixed everything...  and we were mostly out about town... beautiful weekend, but these old old buildings need to get some newer things.... clean, except the carpet, but not exactly a home away from home",3,2012,09,17
248,Lovely Hotel,"We stayed one night for a concert. The hotel room was really nice and spacious and the beds were really comfortable. The hotel has free car park until 1pm on the day of your check out. Breakfast was 13 euro per person but we didn't have it as there were a number of places beside the hotel. The hotel is conveniently located next to Harcourt street which has some of the best pubs and clubs, Flannery's, Koppers etc. This area can be a bit dodgy at night especially walking home so I'd advise anyone to get a taxi if you go further. Its 10 minute walk to Stephens Green and about 30 mins to Aviva Staduim. The room was 160 for the night which was a little steep since breakfast wasn't included but for going out it was great location!",4,2012,09,17
248,When Irish Eyes are Smiling,"The staff here at the hotel are phenomenal.  I had asked for an early check-in on one of the busiest week-ends in Dublin and they accomodated us to the hilt.  Very helpful, clean, great pub and restaurant and a short walk to St. Stephen's Green and Temple Bar area.
You won't be disappointed.",5,2012,09,14
248,My Home from Home in Dublin,"I have been in Dublin on a secondment for my company for the last five weeks.  I have stayed at the Camden for those five weeks.  Firstly let me tell you about the staff.  On reception they are so nice, so polite and can't do enough for you.  They made sure I had the same room every week so that it did feel like home from home!  My room was comfortable, clean and fresh every day.  Great shower too! My teeny weeny complain is the hairdryer.. not to good!  They do a great breakfast and the meals I had in the bar/bistro were very good.  The pool, and spa are an added bonus.  I still have three weeks left of my secondment left to complete but unfortunately I can't stay at the Camden as it is fully booked each week.  A great place to stay, convenient and central for the sights and shopping.",4,2012,09,14
248,Will stay here again!,"Due to a work-conference in Dublin, I stayed a week at the Camden Court Hotel. 
Overall, I am very happy with the stay and I will stay at this hotel again the next time I visit Dublin.

First of all, the location is great. A bit outside the busy down-town, but still within easy walking distance. Outside the hotel, there are both some cafèes and shops where one can pick up snacks and take-away coffee! The area outside the hotel is not the most charming, but it worked for me. 

The hotel itself is very nice. Friendly and helpful staff who are ready to assist. Cleaning services are great, my room was spotless for the days I requested cleaning services. 

The lobby area is spacious and open, with lots of seating space. Not sure about all the floors, but the floor I stayed in (6th) is of an older date. Personally, I really liked the ""old"" feel of my room. It was not at all dirty or sad, just a bit dated as far as the interior. I found it to be charming and cozy. Spacious room and tiled bathroom with a bathtub. 
Wonderful bed and pillows, I truly slept like a baby. Would recommend this hotel especially for people who are tired of uncomfortable beds! 

The breakfast area is nice and spacious. Some people might find the breakfast buffet a bit limited, as there are few choices. A section of warm foods, a few choices for sandwhiches and cereal. Fruit, yougurt and juices. Personally, I loved the breakfast with musli, yougurt and lots of fresh fruit and found the breakfast buffet to more than sufficient. 

I did not use the recreational facilities (training room and pool), but my colleague who did really liked the equipment available. 

Overall, I would recommend this hotel and would like to stay here again!",4,2012,09,14
248,"Great find, recommended","I stayed here for a work trip and was very impressed, especially for its price which made me expect a lot less. The gym and pool were well equipped. The staff were attentive and friendly. The food was tasty and well priced and the location was great. The rooms could be upgraded a little and the breakfast was a bit fast food buffet in style, but overall I would definitely stay here again. The free WiFi was also good to see!",4,2012,09,09
248,Disappointed,"We would have normally stayed at the Marriott hotel but due this and many other hotels of this catorgory being fullybooked, took this hotel because of the ratings given by other Tripadvisor reviewers. Here with my son who was starting an Erasmus semester with one of the city colleges so took a room with 2 single beds. Was first given a room facing onto the busy road this hotel is built alongside. The room was hot with no air conditioning with the window unable to be opend (although due to traffic was anyway unadvisable). Asked for a quieter cooler room and were told the hotel was fully booked however got moved within half an hours waiting. We had checked in before midday and not late in the afternoon and I believe this was to our advantage. Room given to us still had no air conditioning however was cooler and window could be opened. Traffic noise was still an issue even though room looked onto inner yard. Room very very basic, and photos on website are very very misleading. Bathroom cramped, minimal towel number of towel were very thin. For a large hotel the lack of a concierge is not a good idea. The reception  desk staff (never enough of them on duty) appeared helpful but in actuall fact were not. e.g. When asked how the local transportation travel card worked, they didn't know (there is tram stop just outside the hotel). When asked for ideas for a good cafe that served High Tea I was directed to Starbucks! We had lunch in the restaurant set up like a 'no frills' canteen, soup and wrap were good and priced right.
One person who did stand out for his friendliness and service was Krystian the Office Manager.",3,2012,09,08
248,Nice hotel,My first visit to Dublin and hence Camden Court Hotel. Would be very happy to return. Was allocated a huge room (family room with double bed and 2 single beds) which was more than adequate. Breakfast was very good.,4,2012,09,07
248,Total bliss,"You could not get better. Free parking, delicious food, close to shopping, love staying here : D choose between the restaurant or the bar either way you will not be disappointed. The staff are so helpfully and friendly never had a bad stay I stay here 3-4 times a year.",5,2012,08,31
248,Another great stay,Our 3rd visit in the last couple of years.  My son really enjoyed the gym and pool and my wife and daughters enjoyed getting thier nails done in the spa.  Breakfast 1st class and good value.  Room close to city centre.  Have booked again for rugby in November.,5,2012,08,28
248,Excellent location with good parking; room was unexceptional,"Really great location for daytime excursions to Grafton St etc. and also ideally located for nighttime eating, drinking and being merry!

Room was very ordinary as was the breakfast. Would definitely skip breakfast and eat at one of the zillion cafes nearby instead. 

Did observe less than stellar customer service at check-in but it wasn't anything major.",4,2012,08,27
248,impressed,"stayed for 2 nights in august 2012, dont usually spend as much as this on accommodation, but it last minute .very impressed with everything. not cheap, but worth  the money..didnt eat there. didnt use spa . within walking distance of the city centre, approx 30 mins. will defo go back",4,2012,08,27
248,Camden Court Hotel Dublin,"stayed at this hotel on 23rd August for one night taking in the Riverdance Show at the Gaiety.
The rooms were lovely, spotlessly clean, very comfy beds, the staff very helpful and friendly and the food - DELICIOUS!! Dinner was included in the price (as was the ticket for Riverdance) and the food and service was fabulous!! We had a 6 year old in our party of 5 and she was treated really well! Breakfast the next morning was great - freshly cooked and lovely and warm!!
I've already recommend this hotel to work friends and personal friends!!
I'm looking forward to going back again!!",5,2012,08,26
248,Return visit to the Camden Court,"This was our second visit to the Camden Court, the first being 12 yrs ago.  It was a pleasure to see how the hotel has developed over the years, the reception, bar and restaurant did not disappoint.  The staff were in the restaurant were wonderful, especially Syed, the manager, who is not only an excellent role model for the hotel, but a really lovely man, who clearly takes a pride in his job and the hotel.  Syed's staff on both nights were excellent, interacting with us and other diners. The on site parking was great and the location of the hotel was to far from the sights and sounds of Dublin.  Having a swim at the end of day was wonderful, however, the required use of swimming hats is, to say the least, a strange one, especially when your husband is bald!!!  The reason given.... it's a health and safety issue as you lose heat from your head... well it made us laugh!!",4,2012,08,25
248,A very enjoyable stay at Camden Court,"Spent 2 nights in the Camden Court recently with our 6 month old child. We wanted a hotel which was family friendly with a swimming pool in the city centre at a reasonable price - Camden Court did not disappoint! The hotel were more than accommodating with our requests of a travel cot and fridge. The restaurant staff sterilised our babys bottles no problem at all. A staff member at the hotel happily showed me around the pool before using the facilities. The car park at the hotel is another huge bonus, which is free to use.  The location of the hotel is approx 15min walk from St Stephen's Green and Grafton Street.  We had breakfast in the hotel and the choice and service was great. We also had an evening meal in the hotel and our waiter was super friendly and very helpful! The food was delicious.  All staff we had dealings with were brilliant.  We enjoyed tea and chocolate muffins in the lobby which was nice to sit and relax and watch the world go by.  The hotel also has a spa facility on site but I didn't get an opportunity to use - maybe next time lol I did get to visit the hairdressers located infront of the hotel - highly recommend although 33 euro for a blow dry? maybe this is city prices? The bedroom was perfect, couldn't complain - although our 2 night stay was during a very warm climate and the bedroom was so warm at night. As it is Ireland I understand that having air conditioning is not required much but some kind of temperature control would be needed as our bedroom was overlooking a very busy street and we couldn;t keep the window open at night. However, this did not keep us from sleeping - the beds were very comfy.
Taking all into consideration we would definitely recommend the Camden Court to family and friends and hope to return again soon",4,2012,08,17
248,Pretty Good,"The hotel was clean, staff very friendly, buffet breakfast was good.  The location seemed to be a little off the beaten path but it really wasn't that far from all the sights in Dublin.  It was a good walk.  The pub around the corner was a good meeting place called The Bleeding Horse.  All around good experience.  I especially liked their security.  After a certain time, they won't let you in the hotel without giving your name and room number.",4,2012,08,17
248,Very Convenient with Free Parking,"We stayed at The Campden Court for 1 evening and where more than happy with the Hotel and staff. Very convenient location and a very large room even for a triple.  The fact that on site parking is available is a great plus and if touring, as we where, the flexibility in being able to leave the car a little longer on the day of departure is also great. ( A small charge is made for this extra time.)
We took the opportunity, while in Ireland, to see Riverdance and again the hotel was within reasonable walking distance as it is for Grafton Street, Trinity College and many other areas south of the river.",4,2012,08,14
248,Excellent again......,"Have stayed at the Camden on occasions to numerous to mention,for approx 7 years. Stayed on business regularly, and with family and friends at weekends.
Here on business in August, and again quite excellent!
Cannot fault the hotel for location,cleanliness,great staff...its literally home from home.
If you are in Dublin,give this hotel a try,you won't be disappointed.",5,2012,08,14
248,Highly Recommendable,"We stayed at the Camden Court Hotel the night of our arrival from SA, via Dubai and again the night before our return. Never having visited Ireland, Camden Court was our first introduction to Irish hospitality. Having emailed, we were told how ""delighted"" they were to accommodate us. Our accommodation was fantastic - staff welcomed us like we were their favourite patrons. They were friendly to our children and nothing was too much trouble for them. Our room was really spacious and comfortable, and cleanliness goes without saying. We had a fridge in our room on our first night and it came in quite handy. Staff were able to advise on tourist attractions, transport etc. and in the morning we were treated to a wonderful breakfast!
If we had to find anything to complain about, it would be that although we booked for four people, our rooms were fitted out for three, but it was rectified immediately! Also, with these tour groups, they seem to have limited time (as is the complaint of us all) and were constantly stretching over you while you were trying to get your breakfast - but that is not the hotel's fault, just lack of manners on their patrons' part. We had a fantastic stay in Dublin, being close to everything we needed and to public transport for places further away. We will stay here again when we next visit Ireland, it really is friendly, clean and they are great with children too!",4,2012,08,13
248,Clean and Neat,"I stayed at the Camden Court Hotel in Dublin in July for 2 nights this year.  I found it to be a very clean and newer hotel.  It has an excellent breakfast buffet, which is complimentary!  The staff at the front desk were all very helpful.  One of the staff members even offered to let my aunt call here husband in the States to let him know we had arrived safely since her mobile phone was not working due to a service problem in Europe.  The rooms are very basic, but very neat and clean.  The location of the hotel is great..right in the city and not far from Merrion Square, St. Stephen's Green and Grafton Street areas.  We walked to Dublin Castle from the hotel as well,which took about 20 minutes or so.  I would highly recommend this hotel for your stay the next time you are in Dublin!",5,2012,08,13
248,Would Recommend,"Arrived at the hotel (had to get directions from a taxi driver) parked in hotel carpark (free to residents).  Check in was quick and informative the reception was polite and helpful.  Our room was considerably larger than a normal triple room - it had two double beds, both clean and fresh.  There was a flat screen television, tea/coffee making facilities and hairdryer.  The bathroom had a bath with a rose shower over it, toilet and sink.  Toiletries were provided, shower gel, shampoo, soap and shower cap.  The hotel is lovely.  It is approximately 10 minutes walk to Grafton Street area  and the hotel is in safe location.  We did not use the breakfast facilities in the hotel.  We did use the pool - which was very relaxing after a hard days walking/shopping in Dublin.  There is a steam room, sauna, jacuzzi and pool - remember to take your swimming hat - otherwise it'll cost you 2.50 Euros to buy one there.  Great spot - would definitely recommend to a friend and would stay there again.",4,2012,08,12
248,Highlights of Ireland,"This hotel was quite nice. The reception staff was very friendly and professional, check in was fast. The room was clean and well appointed, The first stay was on the third floor overlooking the parking lot the second stay was on the first floor overlooking the parking lot as well. The room didn't have airconditioning so we had the window open through the night and it wasn't noisy at all. The restaurant and hotel bar were very nice, staff was friendly food was delicious and the beer was cold.",4,2012,08,11
248,Excellent spot in Dublin,"We stayed in this hotel for 3 nights from the 1 August to the 4th of August.  After traveling overnight from Bangkok we took a taxi from the airport to the hotel.  As it was was about 9am on a weekday I expected heavy traffic but the ride was smooth and the fare was only 25 Euro.  

I did not expect the room to be available upon arrival and was right but had planned for this by planning to use the health club.  We went for a swim and a sauna and changed and got ready in the fitness center and at 11am we went back upstairs to put some more stuff in the luggage room and were pleasantly surprised to be told our room was ready.  

Room was on the 4th floor and overlooking the parking lot.  I had specifically requested a renovated room in the back due to reading some other reviews about noisy rooms.  Room was well appointed and very comfortable.  Bed was firm and King size and bathroom was spotless with a great shower and full bath.  Bed was very comfortable and shower hot and powerful and bathroom amenities were quite good. My only complaint would be that there is no air conditioning.  It was not a problem for me as we kept the window fully open and the temperature was 16c in Dublin during this time, though on several mornings I heard other guests at breakfast complaining about noise in the front and their room being stuffy. 

We had not paid for breakfast as were planning on eating out some mornings.  Though I have to say what they provided was pretty good for 13 Euro.  Full Irish breakfast with great oat meal all served buffet style and plenty of fruit, cheese, great yogurt and breads.  The only downside was the coffee was dreadful.  Though on the last morning we got to the dining room at 6.55am when it was supposed to be open at 7am and the dining room was open but filthy with used breakfast dishes and half eaten food on nearly all the tables and the cold buffet practically empty.  I did ask the waitress what had happened and if in fact it opens early.  Her answer was ""I don't know""  I can only assume one of the tour groups had an early check out and had eaten early.

At all times the receptionists, health club attendants, maids and waiters were very friendly and helpful.  From taking my passports/money etc to the safe everyday morning and evening (no in room safes) to giving clear directions.

Hotel is directly on the LUAS line (tram) and with easy access to Dundrum Shopping Center or one stop to St. Stephens Green though we walked that back forth all the time as it only a 10 minute walk.

Excellent hotel and a great price for the location in Dublin.  Many small restaurants in the area and several supermarkets.",4,2012,08,09
248,Fab Hotel,Stayed in this hotel Friday 3rd of August & could not fault it from check in to check out! The staff were very friendly & so helpful & professional. Very comfortable hotel & spotlessly clean. We had a double room on the 3rd floor facing onto the carpark & it was very quiet. Had breakfast delivered to the room which was superb. Very relaxing & lovely atmosphere in this hotel....would highly recommend it.,5,2012,08,05
248,Family room overlooking noisy road,"As I wasn't sure of the exact location of this hotel, got a taxi from Connolly train station.  I'm very glad that I did, as it was further away than I anticipated from  Grafton Street. When we arrived, we were unable to check in straight away as the computer system was down!  However, the receptionist was very professional and said that she would call as over as quickly as possible, which she did. As my title suggests, our family room was overloking a very busy road, with streams of traffic roaring by constantly.  I found this a bit strange, especially for families with younger children, must be a nightmare to try to  get them to sleep with all that noise going past your window!  I have no complaints about the room itself, just the thinking of having family rooms in the noisiest part of the hotel! 
We paid 13 euros each for breakfast, which was okay, nothing special in my opinion. It 's buffet style, but the cooked breakfast is served to you, even though it's all there already cooked on display.  Not sure what the thinking is behind that is either, as you might as well serve it yourself  in my opinion. 
I wouldn't choose to stay here again, as it's a bit too far out of the city centre/train station for my preference, and the traffic was a deal breaker for me.",3,2012,08,01
248,Nice place,"Stayed here mid July 2012 as part of stag group. Wouldn't really call it a stag hotel but that is a good thing - it was nice to go away for 2 nights and stay somewhere comfortable. Room was comfortable, shower hot and quiet at night. Location is ok, bit of a walk to city centre but shouldn't put you off booking it.",4,2012,08,01
248,Top end of the 3* spectrum,"Stayed here for two nights with a group of friends on a Monday & Tuesday night in July. Rooms were very clean and comfortable, not massive but spacious enough. The hotel design is very pleasant but strikes me as more of a business hotel (they have conference facilities, and the hotel seemed to be in the business district).

We got a fairly good rate with this hotel during a sale, and it was well worth what we paid. Breakfast wasn't included and to be honest sounded a little pricey (we ate breakfast at Cafe Bliss in nearby Montague Street, which was still about 8-10Euro for hearty breakfast, tea and juice but I really recommend it!) We also didn't eat here or use the bar, so i can't comment on that.

Other bonus of this hotel is that free access to the gym, pool, sauna etc is included.

Staff were very friendly, my only complaint was the water pressure in the shower was pretty poor - though this may have just been my room! This is a 3* hotel, but it's a very good 3* hotel on a par with some of the lower quality 4* hotels I've stayed in.

The only reason I possibly wouldn't stay here again is the distance to the city centre. Although St Stephen's Green is only a 10 minute walk, Temple Bar is more like 15-20 minutes at a tourist amble. Although only about a mile, it's a long enough walk to not want to nip back to the hotel in the middle of the day, and we got a cab home after our night out in Temple Bar.

The positives of the distance though was that the area was very peaceful in the evening, and gave us the opportunity to explore some less tourist-trap restaurants, pubs and bars - but being nearer to the city centre action may have been more useful for a trip as short as ours.

Other than that though, highly recommended.",4,2012,07,30
248,Camden,As part of my tour of Ierland I stayed in the Camden Hotel. I found the room very comfortable and the food was excellent. The breakfasts was memorable and represented the tasty food which Ireland is known for. It is also near everything and I reached it easily via the local bus service from the airport. This was also very inexpensive.,4,2012,07,27
248,"Good Stay, but no A/C","This is a repeat stay at the Camden Court, this time three nights. With past stays, in past years, it has been off season, thus didn't give thought to air-conditioning. Though temperatures were mild, with humidity, it was somewhat uncomfortable without a/c, although they were quick to offer fans. Restaurant food was good; better than previous visits. Breakfast buffet substantial. Location is a 10 minute walk to Grafton St. Free wifi always a bonus these days. Overall a good choice.",4,2012,07,26
248,Good location,"Our family really liked this hotel.it was an easy 10 minute walk to graft on street.a bonus is we got to walk past St.Stephens green every day.
The rooms were neat and clean.The staff was very friendly and helpful.the door man had a lot of info as well..",4,2012,07,26
248,"""Good Location""","Stayed two nights with my husband and 10 year old twins on a family deal with meal included.  Good location with free parking which means alot in Dublin as parking can be costly.  Family room good size had a problem with a noise heater but was quickly fixed.  Food lovely, staff friendly.  Kids loved the pool.  Would diffently stay here again on my next trip to Dublin as its only 3/4 minute walk to St Stephen Green and a lovely children friendly hotel.",4,2012,07,24
248,A real comfortable and cosy hotel,"a real cosy feel to this hotel as you enter.The staff were extremely friendly and helpful.We stayed here for two nights and ate in the restaurant on one of them and the food was perfect.
Location is ideal as it  is a 10 min walk to city centre and has free parking.Free wifi through out the hotel also",5,2012,07,19
248,Highly recommend,"We had only 1 night in Dublin (unfortunately) and we are very glad to have chosen to stay at Camden Court Hotel. Free Parking, easy and very quick check in, very nice feel to the hotel and the rooms were spot on, exactly what you want. Comfortable big double bed, nice amenities and spacious and big bathroom. The location of Camden court was also ideal, 2-5 minute walk to Stephens Green and Grafton Street and this is where you will find all the high street stores, fantastic little cafes, awesome restaurants, bars and pubs.

When I go back to Dublin, will definitely be staying here again.",5,2012,07,17
248,"Great location, friendly staff, clean rooms and FREE parking and FREE use of the leisure centre!","Really close to Gragton Street and free carparking.
Enjoyed our stay and will deffo use again. ",5,2012,07,16
248,"Great location , good hotel...would have no hesitation staying again","We stayed at the camden court as part of a package to see Phantom of the Opera at the Bord Gais theatre , we paid €290 for the room which included early bird and show tickets so,  not quite sure what the breakdown was but overall we thought it was good value , to be honest had the early bird menu offered better choice's (main's were chicken in sticky lemon and garlic, salmon , pork chop or pasta arrabiata...all very cheap to produce) we would have said great value. Food was nice just not amazing. Service on the other hand was fantastic , our waiter couldn't have been nicer or more helpful. We had a bottle of Italian pinot grigio with our meal and this was  €24 standard for most restaurants.
The hotel is litreally a 2 min walk from the harcourt luas stop so the location couldn't be better. The check in staff were friendly and informative , the room was lovely , newly refurbished and very comfortable. Iroining board and iron in the room along with a flat screen tv plenty of channels and a clean bathroom with powerful shower.
The hotel room was warm but we left the window open a little as there was a securirt latch and were fine then , no noise at all but, we were overlooking a car park as opposed to the street.
When we returned at about 2.30am we asked for a jug of water to bring to the room and the night porter duly obliged again very friendly and polite.
When we went for breakfast I found it a bit odd not to be seated , so , we just at a table and figured things out ourselves , some of the breakfast waiting staff could do with adapting the friendly demeanour of the other staff . As I was sitting at the breakfast table waiting for my sister I called a waiter to order some coffee and tea - he looked at me like I had two heads ordering both when I was sitting alone ........
Info on the area :If you are going to the bord gais theatre it's about ten euro's in a taxi. It's 1.60 for the luas from harcourt street to stephens green. 
We went for a couple of drinks to Dicey's beer garden just around the corner , a very mixed age group chart music and €4.50 per bottle of beer ...but , a vodka was 4.50 and a cranberry juice 3.60...wow .
The bleeding horse is litreally next to the hotel so we popped in there also as it had been highly recommended ..very busy , alternative music and an extortioniate €5.40 per bottle of beer .
Finally from the recpetion to friends and even the taxi man we had so many people recommend  Zaytoon for a kebab again across the road from the hotel ....and I'm happy to say I can also highly recommend this place living up to the best kebab in Dublin saying.",4,2012,07,15
248,Camden Court - Conference Heaven!,"Thank you to all at The Camden Court Hotel for your superb services at our last conference in July! If you are looking for a place to hold your important events definitely contact the Uber efficient Sandra & the conference team at the Camden Court in Dublin city centre. All your needs will be catered for to the highest standard and in the friendliest manner. Menus for dining services are scrumptious and with delightful vegetarian options everyone can be catered for. The Camden Court is truly an oasis in the middle of the city centre. You wil feel nestled away from the noise and hustle of the city the moment you step inside and still have access to everything from sightseeing, shopping and business sector by stepping right out the door. 
I have seen the rooms for our delegates inclusive of VIP exec suites and they are excellent. But I do recommend asking for quietest sections of Hotel as the bar next door can be loud on the weekends. Whether you want to treat yourself to a city break get away, a very comfortable business stay or  - as in our case a special event or conference. I highly recomend the Camden Court - as the name implies, you will be treated like Royalty!",4,2012,07,15
248,Nice Lobby - Noisy and Hot Bedroom,"I stayed in this hotel on the first night and last night of my first visit to Ireland on a recent tour that I took with members of my family.  My parents and I had a three bed room on both of these nights, which happened to be the same room both times, room 200.  On the first night, Sunday night, sleeping was difficult because of the street noise and some bar traffic below the window but on Friday night the sleeping was almost impossible.  Bar revelers talked loudly and sang songs until after 4:00 a.m.  If the window was closed the room became hot.  I know others in our group had better experiences at this hotel, in rooms that were quieter, but I would definitely avoid this room that is almost directly above a bar entrance.  I tried to switch rooms but was told there were no rooms available.",2,2012,07,14
248,Great Location and Lovely Hotel,"This is now the second time I have stayed at the Camden Court Hotel and both times I extremely enjoyed my stay. The staff at reception and spa are extremely friendly and helpful. The rooms look slightly different to the website however are still very nice. I stayed for 4 nights and the rooms were cleaned everyday. The hotel is in a great location just a short walk from st Stephens Green, Graffton Street and The Temple Bar area. While staying at the hotel you can use the swimming pool, sauna, jacuzzi and steam room- I had an excellent day using these services along with the back massage which is also available in the hotel. I would recommend this hotel to everyone.",5,2012,07,14
248,Convenient location in Dublin,"My family of 3 stayed in a ""triple"" at this property in Dublin.  The room was sufficiently large with one double and two twin beds.  The hotel was walking distance to Grafton Street, the Wax Museum, Trinity College, and the center of town - so that proved to be very convenient.  Food was excellent and it's adjacent to a classic Irish pub which also serves food during a restricted time range.  There is a pharmacy and some small shops and food service establishments in close proximity too.  No air conditioning, as is the case for most hotels in Ireland from my experience, but for this trip (early July 2012) it was not needed at all.  I would be inclined to use this hotel again.",4,2012,07,13
248,Christmas Party Experience,"We had our Xmas Party here last December. It was a great deal great location and a great night. People were delighted with the food, entertainment and service throughout the night. There was great variety in the menu, the entertainment was glamorous and original and the bar service was excellent. We were not left wanting for anything throughout the night. Thank you for your extremely professional handling of the event from first phone call to last orders.",5,2012,07,11
248,A one night stay,We didn't eat here.   The hotel was very welcoming and extremely helpful.   They have free parking which is a real bonus for a centre city hotel.   The room was clean but very hot and noisy - the noise coming in from the outside.,3,2012,07,11
248,Lovely place to stay in Dublin,"We couldn't fault this hotel at all - very clean, rooms lovely and in great location.  The hotel is about 15-20mins walk to St. Stephens Green, there is also a Luas line running a few streets from the hotel.  The free car parking is a great advantage for the hotel.",5,2012,07,10
248,Great hotel & service,"We had such a good experience at the Camden Court Hotel, Dublin that we have decided to return again this coming hoiday season.  We booked the hotel through Virgin Vacations Christmas Package last year (2011).  The staff is very friendly and competent.  They were quite eager to help us with information, suggestions and directions.  The plan included a  full breakfast and it was excellent...many choices including eggs cooked to your specification, fresh fruit, choices of bacon, sausage, etc.  Highly recommended if you are looking for a reasonably price holiday vacation get away.....just a 15minute walk from the heart of  Dublin (or take the tram which is just around the coner from the hotel for 1.5 pounds).  We alsways walked becasue you pass by beautifully painted doors on the streets.  There is an excellent pub attached to the hotel building called the ""Bloody Horse"" very good selection of beers and pub food.  It is proported to be one of the oldest pubs in Dublin.  a great place to unwind after a long day of seeing the sights.
PS, Dublin is very ""walkable.""

248,Execellent Hotel,"Camden Court was an execellent Choice Hotel. It was an easy 20 min walk into the city center. The hotel had our room ready for a 7:30 am check in, which was awesome to freshing up/ nap after an overnight flight.  The Irish breakfest had large  hot and cold dishes. The staff was professional, pleasant and very helpful. We did not use the pool, but it look large and clean. The parking lot is small in the rear of the building, but if it is full there is an underground car park below the building.  I would recommend the hotel for both business and liesure travel.  Its a good location to sight see, and you won't be in the middle of city center traffic.",4,2012,07,09
248,Excellent desk staff; comfortable room,"The reception staff of the Camden Court Hotel deserves accolades for helpfulness and expertise. In late June, we arrived with a tour group to have two days in Dublin before flying home.  Unfortunately, during the first night's sleep, my wife had a medical emergency, and we asked reception to call an ambulance.  She spent the next five days in good hospital care for a heart problem, while I lived at the Camden Court. The staff worked to provide me lodging at the hotel, and after hospital discharge one more night. When the hotel had no room one night, they found me a good substitute.
I spent some time in the lobby and observed that the desk staff assisted all guests with cheerful, polite, attentive service.
The room was quiet, the beds comfortable, everything clean.  Because of its comfort, my wife asked to return for the night after discharge.  Choose the “with breakfast” rate, because it is an excellent buffet.  The reasonable fee to use the room phone with a calling card (31 cents) and the lobby internet terminal (10 minutes, 1 euro) helped me keep in touch with Ireland and the States. I especially commend the staff and service at the Camden Court.",5,2012,07,08
248,Birthday celebration event,"We arranged a family celebration at this hotel. The location is good because it is close to the city centre [10 minutes walk-away], well served by public transport but has car parking available also.  Staff were cooperative and worked with us in varying + finalising arrangements. The bedroom, leisure and dining facilities inside were very good.",4,2012,07,07
248,Good hotel for a very reasonable price,"Price:  if you get a good online deal, not expensive (I paid approx £70 per night)

Staff:  very pleasant and helpful

Public areas:  very good
Lifts / Hallways:  very good

Bathroom:  very good. Good shower.

Bedroom:  bed EXCELLENT (pocket spung bed: I probably had the most comfortable hotel sleep ever!), plenty of space everywhere. No drawers for clothes though, just a shelf in the wardrobe. No air-con, so could get a bit stuffy on hotter days. 

Noise: I was on the courtyard side: with the window open, there's a noticible ongoing drone of heat-exchangers, so either close the window or wear earplugs!

Eco-friendliness:  compact fluorescents for main lights, quality white LED lights by bed. Let down badly by staff clearly ignoring ""leave towel on rail if you will re-use it..."" notice, as my towels were replaced daily.

Breakfast: 13 euros, but plenty of choice, including a good quality full cooked Irish Breakfast. Restaurant staff generally good and attentive. 

Wifi: free, provided by BT Wifi, reasonably fast, but I kept getting logged out (this is second time of writing thei review whilst using it!!)
Don't forget your swim trunks so you can use the pool!

Already booked a room here for my return visit next month",4,2012,07,05
248,Great Vacation,"Camden Court Hotel was the best, would definitely stay here again when in Dublin!  Hotel staff were great, room was clean and comfortable, resteraunt and breakfast were wonderful.  Close to everything!",5,2012,07,05
248,Good Experience,"Very nice hotel, within walking distance of many things and near a bus stop for longer distances.  We didn't eat there or use the spa but we did visit the recreational facilities and they appeared to be excellent.  The room was clean and comfortable.",4,2012,07,04
248,a pleasant stay,This hotel is conveniently located and the reception staff is pleasant.  The room was comfortable and clean.  A good place to stay.,4,2012,07,03
248,Just.....fine in Dublin for business,"I have now stayed at the Camden Court around 6 times and just realised I have never reviewed it. And then it struck me why. There is very little to say - in a positive or negative way! 
This hotel does everything ....just fine. But perhaps there's not much wrong with that, and therein may lie the hotel's selling point. 

The rooms are on the whole, large and clean. The last few times, I have had a view over office blocks to the rear, which while not an idyllic view, matters not to me on business. After all, most people are here because it is a short walk into Temple Bar, Stephen's Green and Grafton street, or the River and the IFSC. It is clean, well presented and has good, unfussy service. 

I have eaten in the restaurant a few times, and have found it to be.....yes....just fine. The food is good, not excellent, the wines are just fine and the price is...yes...also fine. 

The Guinness is good (as one would hope, although the Bleeding Heart pub next door is a cracking place (it is also on the Joyce trail if that's your thing).

Why do I stay here? Because everything is just fine. I know I will get a comfy room, a decent enough meal, a nice pint of Guinness and a central base to get to my meetings in Dublin. 

Would I want to holiday here? Certainly not. There is nothing either that sets me on fire or raises any enthusiasm for the place. But on balance, it's just....fine. And I will return.",3,2012,07,01
248,Overbooked and offloaded to sister hotel...!,"Booked this back in May only to advised on arrival that they had a technical problem with web bookings which caused them to be over booked. As such we were relocated to the sister hotel about 15 minutes drive away, which they assured us was of the same quality. It wasn't!!!

On arrival at the Camden there is a warm appealing atmosphere and there were plenty of facilities that made it a good choice.

Disappointing to be relocated, especially when they could have contacted us earlier to advise of the muck up and allowed us to rebook elsewhere in good time.",2,2012,06,30
248,Over booked & farmed us out to lower standard,"On arrival was pretty impressed with the look and feel of the hotel, only to be greeted with a ""oh, can you sit over there for a minute and I ll be right over"" from the receptionist. 

A minute or two later we were attended by the duty manager who politely told us that the hotel was overbooked due to a technical error with their system. As such they would need to relocate us to another hotel nearby, a sister hotel, which he assured us was to the same standard - The Grand Canal Hotel - it wasn't, and the assured ""nice room"" turned out to be a standard family room!

They provided a complimentary evening meal and bottle of wine and have offered a complimentary nights stay should we ever return. The meal was just about ok and the bottle of wine a cheap ""house white"". 

Not exactly what you would want for a wedding anniversary visit! 
Having booked in May, would have expected them to contact us at least a week prior to visiting to let us know what had happened and to sort things out sooner. Disappointed to say the least.",1,2012,06,30
248,Lovely hotel....bad welcome,"We are regular visitors to Dublin and we decided to stay here because we got a received a great rate on hotels.com. Arriving at the hotel, we were impressed by the reception area. We checked in to find our room was not ready so we sat and got a drink from the bar. This is where our problem began. A member of staff who appeared to be senior to other receptionists proceeded to imply that we had not purchased the drinks there due to having our bags (which did include a sealed bottle) beside us. We clarified that we had just bought the drinks at the bar. She continued to question staff beside us about the drinks. I thought this was particularly bad as she could have been a lot more discrete about her questioning. We were made feel so suspicious that we proceeded to reception to show the receipt from the bar. This was definitely not the welcome that we had expected. 

Apart from this our stay was o.k. The room was clean and comfortable. The bathroom was nice but the shower was no way powerful. 
Location is very good and close to lots of bars and restaurants. I would consider staying here again but the price would have to be right. Having stayed in various other hotels in Dublin, it would not be top of my list.",3,2012,06,25
248,Excellent facilities and location,"The Camden Court is very conveniently situated next to the Harcourt Street Luas tram stop. Those travelling from Dublin airport should take the number 16 bus from the airport which also stops just outside (ask the driver for Upper Camden Street) - at only €2.35 a single its much cheaper than the airport bus or taxi and just as convenient.

I routinely stay in this hotel on business in Dublin. The rooms have been undergoing a refurbishment, and those that have been completed are stylishly furnished and comfortable. Bathrooms are spacious and clean. In addition the spa facilities in the basement provide a very good swimming pool for unwinding.  Both the bar area and restaurant provide very good evening meals. I am usually staying in the hotel to run training courses to Irish businesses, and I find the conference facilities and lunch buffets excellent. 

There are some grips. Make sure you get breakfast in your room rate - it really isn't worth what they charge for a walk in, and there are plenty of little cafes close by that do a better breakfast for a better price. I once stayed in the hotel and discovered in the morning that my bedsheets had mould on them (clearly a damp laundry issue!). However, when I raised my complaint with the hotel management, they dealt with it promptly, were very apologetic, and immediately offered a discount etc. I had no quibble as to how my complaint was dealt with, and this positive out of a negative situation has ensured they have retained my business.

I have no hesitation in recommending a stay here.",4,2012,06,25
248,Great location for our 1st trip to Dublin!,"When my friend and I made a spontaneous decision to travel to Dublin 5/31-6/6/12, I immediately began my hotel research on TripAdvisor.  Upon speaking with our travel agent, she recommended the Camden Court Hotel based on her own previous stay at the hotel.  I'm pleased to report that we were very happy with our choice.  

We found the location to be perfect for our needs, and aside from a few rain showers that made the 10 minute walk to the Grafton Street area a downer, we otherwise didn't mind being slightly down the street from all the hustle and bustle.  

The hotel lobby is welcoming, and we were pleased with our rooms.  We had a room with 2 twin beds, which was what we wanted.  The room and bathroom were very clean (and I pay particular attention to these details when staying in a hotel).  

We found the internet connection to be annoyingly spotty and intermittent.  So much so that we would typically become too frustrated and just give up.  It was nice to check emails for free, which I know is not the standard at most hotels, but if a hotel offers free wi-fi, it should work.  

Additionally, we did not have wash cloths for our entire 5 night stay.  This is very odd to me, and since we didn't receive them on any day, I assume they aren't provided (we even searched through a housekeeping cart, to no avail).  Bring your own shower-puff!  

While in Dublin, we visited all the major attractions, and took 2 day tours through Viator to Cliffs of Moher, Glendalough, and Kilkenney.  Very worthwhile to venture out and see the beautiful countryside.  

The Bleeding Horse next door was our ""go to pub"" for most meals and pints.  

All-in-all, we both highly recommend the Camden Court!",4,2012,06,20
248,WITH RESERVATIONS,"Dublin is always a difficult place to find reasonably priced accommodation, everything seems to be booked out months in advance, even for a Monday and Tuesday night.  I looked at 20 hotels before I found one with rooms available.  Camden Court is quite well situated and with interesting shops, restaurants and bars in the immediate vicinity. The building itself is banal and unattractive but the entrance foyer is welcoming.   It is clean and the staff, largely East European on the front line, impeccably polite and helpful. Despite the cleanliness the rooms, as others have said, look tired.  The carpets are fine but there is a lot of chipped and scraped paintwork and badly fitted taps and other fixtures, not quite on centre which is just a sign of sloppy work.

The breakfast was excellent though the ""hot"" food was only warm.  The first day I didn't eat another thing all day, the breakfast was so satisfying.  Service was attentive.  I got to the dining room first thing as there was no chance of a sleep in.  I must have had bad luck as a baby was wailing all night in the next room.  Just before 06:00 men began work on refurbishing an office building which faces onto the same courtyard.  The noise really was excruciating.  I know this is not the hotel's fault but it doesn't make the stay pleasant.

I'll look elsewhere next time I am in Dublin.",2,2012,06,20
248,"Perfect location, very nice hotel","Have been staying in Dublin for a long time and for some reason never came across this hotel before. Not really a part of Dublin I know much about but as we were going to Taste of Dublin I went looking for a hotel near the Iveagh Gardens and as this one got great reviews on here I booked it and I'm glad I did. 

Really nice hotel, brilliantly located, especially for any event in the Iveagh Gardens but also for St. Stephen's Green, the National Concert Hall or Copper Face Jacks - all within walking distance. 
The rooms are lovely and perfectly spacious with a nice bathroom, the staff are friendly and the best thing about this hotel - which is unusual for city centre hotels is that it has a very nice swimming pool, jacuzzi, sauna and steam room. 

So would I recommend it? Yes, definitely.",4,2012,06,19
248,Brilliant start to a fabulous weekend,"We only stayed one night, but would definatley go back again. The room was great the bed was a good size and very comfortable,. The staff couldn't have been more helpful, I had a dental emergency and they helped me find a really good dentist right next door.Afternoon tea served in the Lounge was great, thanks for a good nights sleep it could have been so different, but for your attentiveness.",5,2012,06,18
248,i liked it,"stayed here in jan for a concert in the o2..handy & within walking distance of st stephens green and all local pubs..had a good time..arrived late and the girl on the desk was great. REALLY GOOD BREAKFAST :)..housekeeping good, would go back...just the parking was a pain..there is very little of it...would defo go back :) thanks for everything :) forgot to say the guy in the gym was nice and chatty too :)",4,2012,06,18
248,Great location but very poor value,"As a mature couple, we stayed here to attend a nearby concert in the National Concert Hall, a few minutes away. That was the best thing about this hotel. The room was dowdy and neglected, with ill fitting window and shabby curtains and uncomfortable beds. Room only cost was €165.00 for one night not including breakfast; this was a total ripoff. Went to breakfast in the morning and were asked to pay €13.00 per person before going into the breakfast room. I explained that I only wanted coffee and toast, as did my wife, but were told that we had to pay the stated price up front, and that it was ""standard procedure"", whatever that means. As it was a wet morning, we had little option, not wanting to wander nearby Camden Street in the rain.
Staff were quite courteous but it was overall a soulless corporate experience and very bad value. We stayed there before but never again. It would be better value to pick a nicer hotel even if not so central, and then taxi to the place you want to visit in Dublin.",2,2012,06,18
248,Not as good as the wb site!!!,"We booked the hotel for the location and it looked well on the web site. We were delighted to be able to check in early. About 1.00 pm. Unfortunately when we got to our room it was very “Shabby” . The furniture was different from the web site (dated and looked a bit the worse for wear). The walls were dirty and had loads of scratches on the paintwork from the bed, lockers and other areas. 1 of the handles was missing off the bath. Just not a welcoming feel.  We did ask for our room to be changed (not something I would generally do) and the new room was slightly better, but I do stress slightly.  The carpet was sticky, obviously from previous use and not a special non slip coating for safety purposes. The bed clothes were well worn and aged. We did have dinner in the Bar and the food was good but just lacking in atmosphere. In the morning when having breakfast I noticed that a number of the breakfast bowels had food still stuck to them. And on check out we were not asked if everything was OK. This may be due to a fear of the answer. 
So in short, not 1 that I would be recommending unless you need to be very near there and get a very good rate on the room.",2,2012,06,18
248,Comfortable and good location,Stayed one night on business trip.Have stayed here many times over the past half dozen years and have no complaints. The staff are friendly rooms clean and comfortable. The location is good and only about 10 minutes walk takes you to St Stephens Green and Grafton Street.,4,2012,06,15
248,"Overall great stay, clean comfortable hotel, friendly and helpful staff. Would stay again if returning to Dublin.","Stayed at this hotel for 2 nights arriving early on Sunday morning. Upon arriving we went to speak with reception to see if our room was going to be ready any earlier than the check in time of 12, we were told by the receptionist that a room wasn’t available yet but they placed us on a list to enable us to have the first room that was ready and were happy to take our luggage from us and store until we checked in. We came back just over an hour later and our room was ready so we checked in about 10.30. 

Room (532) was spacious and spotlessly clean, very comfortable king sized bed, décor in the room was modern and had everything you needed for your stay. (tea and coffee making facilities, TV, hair dryer, trouser press etc) The hotel also offers a free WIFI service which we found useful when researching where to go. 
Clean bathroom with a good sized bath with shower over, powerful shower with plenty of hot water. Temperature in the room was ideal even without air-conditioning with the option to have the window open if needed. Room was overlooking the car park and we had no problems with noise even with the window left open overnight. 

Swimming Pool, Sauna and gym very nice and clean, with a separate pool for children.  You do need to wear a swimming cap to go into the pool but most people were just wearing the free shower caps provided in the rooms. Gym also clean and well equipped. 

Location of the hotel was about a 10/ 15 min walk to the Temple Bar area/ city centre with the St Stephens Green Park and shopping centre also about a 10 min walk. Walk to the centre is a straight walk along the main road, the area does look a little run down but would say it was relatively safe area with plenty of people around when we walked back to our hotel at night, road lined with shops, bars, cafes etc, taxis and a number of buses run frequently up and down the main road if you don’t fancy walking. The number 16 bus stops just across the road from the hotel and runs to the airport so we chose to get this rather than a taxi for our journey home, cost around €3 each and took approx an hour.",4,2012,06,07
248,"Clean and comfortable, great friendly staff","We stayed here two nights on our Ireland trip, one at the beginning and one at the end.  Everything was great.  The staff was friendly and helpful, breakfast was very good, rooms were clean and had plenty of space.",5,2012,06,02
248,All you need in Dublin,"Modest rooms, but the windows open to the fresh Dublin air. clean rooms. Pool and jacuzzi indoors. Steam room and sauna. Two restaurants, nice bar open til 3am. Hop in pub next door. 
Free TV and Wifi. Super friendly staff. Walking distance to all main attractions, or 1.40 euro bus ride. Date of stay , June 2012",4,2012,06,02
248,Very nice.,"I stayed at this hotel for three nights (Thursday – Sunday). Double room, 4th floor overlooking the parking, quiet room. 
The room has all the expected amenities and the bathroom is functional, clean and OK for size (shower in the bathtub, with a splash-screen).
Staff is helpful and does take the time to give directions. Breakfast buffet is very tasty. 
The hotel is conveniently located behind St. Stephen’s Green Park (10 min. walk), close to Grafton Street where you can find many great shops and restaurants. 
For people wanting to travel by DART the closest station is Pearse Station, which is a fair walk away!!
If you’re staying the last w-e in May, I can only recommend to plan at least an hour or two at the Merrion Square 'Soul Picnic'. The event is free, hosting live soul music the entire afternoon (saturday and sunday)with little booths selling a great variety of different, delicious snacks.",4,2012,05,28
248,Perfect Location,"Perfect Location and free parking, good choice if you can get it at the right price. Can be expensive at certain times. ",3,2012,05,28
248,"Modern hotel, brilliant location","Easy walking distance to St Stephen's Green, Dublin Castle and the incomparable Chester Beatty Library....as well as some excellent pubs! Friendly staff, good breakfasts, utterly delicious scones. Rooms are average.

My only complaint would be the joke of a business center that charges to use the computers!",4,2012,05,26
248,Nice hotel in good location,"This hotel was the perfect first stop on our trip to Ireland.  We arrived early and they were very accomodating and were able to give us a room.  It was clean, nice and well-equiped.  Would highly recommend this hotel to anyone.",4,2012,05,23
248,Fine hotel at good location,"I stayed in this hotel for 4 nights in May and found it fine in all respects. The room was nice, clean, with good bed, equipped with - very useful - iron and an electric kettle, coffee and tea. However the bathroom was rather small and dark.

Internet access in the room is included. There is a gym with plenty of treadmills, bikes, etc. and also a sauna, jacuzzi and a swimming pool - all free to hotel guests. The location of the hotel is very convenient to the business area and tourist attractions.

The breakfast buffet was extensive with both cold and hot foods. I found 'Full Irish Breakfast' to be very enjoyable. All you have to do is give your room number at the restaurant entrance.

The staff are friendly and willing to please, both check-in and check-out were quick.",4,2012,05,21
248,Nice hotel,Stayed at Camden Court Hotel 4/27/12 & 4/28/12 while on a short visit to visit Dublin.  The hotel was quite adequate but needs a bit of updating.  The rooms were clean & the bathroom was well supplied with toiletries.  We found the staff to be very pleasant.  We spent a while sitting in the lobby just relaxing &  people watching.  It was very comfortable with a constant flow of people from all over coming & going.  The buffet breakfast was quite nice with a vast variety of foods both hot & cold to choose from.,4,2012,05,18
248,Great convention venue,"I was one of the Bookcrossing conventioneers who stayed here 13th-16th April. Our room was spacious and very clean with a comfortable bed. Meals (breakfasts and a lunch) which were catered for our convention were very good. The buffet breakfast had great variety and was topped up frequently. The rooms we used for the convention were perfect for our needs and it was wonderful to be able to come and go as needed.
The reception staff were friendly and helpful and coped well with the noisy crowd we sometimes were, and the books we scattered constantly through the lobby.
The hotel is situated in a nice area, good walking distance to St Stephen's Green.",5,2012,05,18
248,Disappointing,"Hotel itself was adequate, however the staff were rude and unhelpful. After explaining that some of our party may not be able to make the trip and we would not need one of the rooms for the second night, we were led to believe that this wouldn't be a problem and they would hold the room ""just in case"". The next day we were summoned and told in no uncertain terms that the room would be charged for 2 nights, no arguments. Will not be back and will not recommend.",2,2012,05,16
248,Excellent Hotel,"I'm a Dubliner and I stayed here recently with some friends(11th -16th April) as we were organising a convention in the hotel. All the staff were brilliant, very helpful and so friendly. The food (breakfasts, lunches and dinners) was very good and great value for money, while the swimming pool and spa area is super. The location of the hotel is excellent as Grafton street and St Stephen's green are within walking distance. 
We were very happy with our room even though it wasn't one of the up-dated ones. There's a really good warm feeling in the hotel which is due in part to the nice, friendly staff and also to the lovely decor in the foyer area and the restaurant. We had nothing but good feedback from all our international guests and I will certainly be recommending this hotel in future to any other friends/visitors of mine.",5,2012,05,15
248,Nice hotel reasonably priced,"I stayed on business may9 and was given what I later found out was one of the refurbished twin rooms on the fourth floor. My colleague changed his to a double as previously requested and that was on the fifth floor which was older decor.

The twin room was excellent. New everything. I found the rest of the hotel very nice and extremely clean. The staff we very helpful and friendly. Waiter service was a bit slow but could not fault service. Breakfast was very good quality buffet hot and cold. We paid 90 euro for one night.",4,2012,05,13
248,Nice Hotel,"I had booked a twin room for a Friday night stay.  The reception area looks fantastic and so did the hotel restaurant, though I didn't eat there.  My stay didn't include breakfast which was €13 each so I ate in a little cafe not far from the hotel.
The room itself was great.  Very nicely laid out.  Amble storage space with the usual tea/coffee factilites which you find inside the wardrobe.  The bathroom was fabulous and had all the extras, soap, shower gel, shampoo.  The windows also open which is great.
The pool on the lower ground floor was really nice.  Not too crowded and the hotel provides you with towels.  One point though you need a swimming cap so bring your own or you can purchase them at the hotel €3 each.  There is also a gym but I didn't use that.
The staff were really nice, very friendly and professional.  

The only negative point was that the corridors are a bit tired looking, especially the woodwork which could definitely do with a new coat of paint.  It was a bit worrying when I first arrived on my floor but the rooms do not reflect the hallway, thankfully.",4,2012,05,08
248,"Nasty decor, noisey hotel, useless curtains","Dublin is overpriced anyway, but this hotel is poor value. The rooms are very very tired. The curtains let in the light. The corridors can be noisey. The cleaning staff make a lot of noise. The heating is stiifling. Service is hit and miss. i was only here for a couple of nights (2nd trip) and choose it for location. It is not a particularly great choice for walking into the city centre, but good for my appiontments. I will try to avoid staying here again.",2,2012,05,07
248,Rooms need a makeover,"Stayed with my partner and baby last week for a 1 night stay. Had stayed previously through work and was disappointed, this time around wasn't much better. Firstly the price €119 for 1 night stay incl breakfast. The Hilton just up the road is €99 incl breakfast for same thing and there is no comparison between the 2. Hilton was booked out same night unfortunately. 

The room was very basic, very dated, cracks on wall, paint marked, could not find a plug to charge phone had to go down on knees to get in under dressing table. Room number 327. Got absolutely soaked by sink after getting dressed up to go out, tap has 1 speed which was full on and sink style meant water went everywhere bar down the plug hole, not impressed. 

Guy at reception was nice. Didn't get to use pool, parking was free, breakfast set up is messy, have to wait for chef to dish up food from a buffet style set up, fight for toast at toaster as some people cannot understand you have to put in the bread rather than come up opportunistically and take somebody else's. Could chef not put in the bread when he sees people coming in. 
Definitely a 3 star based on rooms and breakfast, will be an avoid for me in future

",3,2012,05,06
248,Lovely!,"stayed in camden court for a couple of nights in summer 11, really good hotel, a bit of a trek from o connels street, you wouldn't really be able to walk it in my opinion, however, buses and taxis run frequently into the city centre. luas stop around the corner very handy for dundrum shopping centre, only a few stops away. when we arrived our room wasn't ready even though it was way past check in which was quite annoying to have to wait, however we had a clean spacious room. Breakfast was only FANTASTIC. , really nice! pool is great, it was very quiet which was great to calm down after a hard day around the shops :D would recommend this hotel :)",4,2012,05,05
248,Good hotel - quite central,"The hotel is quite okay overall. Staff is very friendly and helpful. The rooms are clean but already a bit worn out. The food is very good.

Free internet, but reception is not always great",4,2012,05,04
248,Excellent Service,"Stayed at the hotel for 1 night.  The staff were so friendly, from the reception, to housekeeping to leisure centre.  I was a bit aprehensive because I was travelling alone and thought I would feel awkard but I felt very safe, even dining alone in the bar the staff were so friendly and helpful.  The food was excellent I had the bar food, one of the specials of sticky lemon chicken which was just great, and breakfast the following morning was also well worth it, the selection of hot and cold food there was nothing else I could have asked for.  The extra attention to the facilities in the room, iron, kettle, toiletaries etc were all of a very high standard and the room was very clean and warm.  Excellent location within walking distance of all shopping, plus a great bus service.  I very much look forward to staying there again.",5,2012,05,01
248,"Lovely hotel , great location","Stayed at hotel over the wk end 28th April , lovely hotel , great location ,rooms lovely and warm, very clean and comfortable , only had breakfast at hotel but it was lovely , staff were lovely 1bar man very friendly and looked like somebody who enjoyed his job even if we were in the bar late, not sure of his name but I do recall he said he was from delganey in co Wicklow . So to anybody who reads my review I hope it's helpful and I will revisit the hotel again, I cannot comment on the spa as I did not use it.",5,2012,04,30
248,"Great location&staff, but bedrooms need updating","Stayed with family for 3 nights in March 2012.  First room that was allocated to us (6th floor) was, quite simply, grim.  Dirty carpet and curtains, marks on walls, decor awful, view of satellite dish on the flat roof.  We complained immediately and the duty manager appeared very quickly and was very apologetic, offering us a free breakfast and a change of room to the 3rd floor.  This was a better room decor-wise and cleaner, but carpet still not great.  The biggest problem, we found out later, was the double bed - really small and *very* uncomfortable; the mattress was well past it's end of life - way too soft, lumpy and could feel the springs underneath.  We should have complained again, but we put up - a mistake in hindsight as neither my wife nor I slept for the 3 nights.  Housekeeping needs to get sorted bigtime.

Breakfast was fine - staff very attentive.  We ate in the bar one night and were very happy with the meal - both of us had a salad and it was superb - price was good too.  Bar was quite busy early evening, so found a table in the corner.  We asked the waiter if he could clean it - looked like some fairly fresh wine stains were on it - waiter amused us greatly by asking if we wanted it cleaned now or when he brought the drinks.  In the end, we had to wait until he brought the drinks - we didn't mind since the place was busy, but just funny that he asked us such a dumb question.  

Found all the lobby and breakfast staff very helpful, without exception - mostly non-Irish, as is usual these days, but that wasn't a problem.  Location is great - only 15 min stroll to Grafton St.  

We used the pool every day.  It's in the basement but is big enough for a decent swim (20m?), has a small kiddies pool, jacuzzi, steam room and sauna.  Seemed to be clean enough - changing rooms were fine - apart from the 'family' room we were shown to, which seemed to be more of storage cupboard complete with toilet and disabled shower.  Needless to say we gave that a miss the next time we visited the pool and used the normal changing rooms, which were fine.

Overall, hard to give it more than 3 stars - good for location, bar food and service, but boy it needs some serious money spent on updating the bedrooms.  I'd gladly pay a little more to get a good night's sleep - after all, that's mostly the purpose of a hotel, right?",3,2012,04,25
248,Great Location,"Stayed one night recently to attend a concert in the National Concert Hall. Lovely hotel and just a short walk to the event. Recommended. 
Enjoy a few pints afterwards in one of Dublin's landmark pubs The Bleeding Horse right next door.",5,2012,04,25
248,Ten stars would not be enough!!!,"My wife and I  visited the Camden Court Hotel in Dublin. As a well earned break we decided to have a long weekend in Dublin. From the booking stage through to check out the service was amazing. Every member of staff has a fantastic customer empathy that I have never experienced before. 
I have stayed at many 5 star plus hotels in my life and the Camden Court surpasses any positive experience I have had anywhere in the world. The reception staff were so helpful, the cleaning team were so friendly, the waiters at meal times, the chefs who served up the buffet breakfast, in fact every member of staff were the most friendly, efficient, helpful and professional in any hotel we have stayed at. The standards of the room, the food, were of the highest standard. The location was ideal and in easy walking distance from the centre of Dublin. In all a very big thank you tyo a very caring and professional staff and management team.   If you are looking for a fantastic value for money hotel whose staff treat you as if you are the only customer in the building then give the Camden court Hotel a call. You will NOT be disappointed. Our thanks to everyone who made our stay so fantastic.",5,2012,04,24
248,Good location,"We stayed at the Camden Court Hotel in Dublin April 10th for two nights. We found the hotel to be in walking distance to many attractions in Dublin.The hotel itself was clear and served good food but service in the bar area very slow. We had our 6 year old grandson with us and it is difficult for a young boy to sit for over 40 minutes waiting for a meal. Apart from that my husband and I would stay there again. There are many great bars in Dublin to have meal for example Burns. We visited Dublin Zoo and were really impressed with the layout etc.Must say my husband and I our seniors and it nearly killed us walking around for over 4 hours BUT well worth the visit.
Make sure to be prepared for the prices in Dublin, I think it is even more expensive than London.",4,2012,04,23
248,"Didn't stay here, attended a convention","Very impressed with the facilities and level of service.  Lunch was included on the day I was there so don't know what the prices were like, but the food was lovely and service extremely efficient.  Reception staff were helpful, and dealt with a lot of little issues for us with efficiency and friendliness.",4,2012,04,20
248,Great Hotel in nice location,"My husband and i stayed here again for the third time and it is still a great place to stay,only about 15 min walk down to Grafton St, or you could get the luas down if not up to walking.
There is free parking which is great if staying a few nights. Rooms are nice and comfy with radiators that you can turn on or off as needed and windows can be opened if too warm. Only had breakfast there and it was as good as any hotel ive stayed in good choices to pick from . leisure center is a bonus too. We will def be back again.",5,2012,04,17
248,"Second stay, just as good as the first","As we had enjoyed our stay at this hotel a couple of years ago we decided to go back on our trip to Dublin.  It was just as good as the first visit.  It's a little bit away from the centre (about 10 minutes) walk and the area around it is a little drab.  Apart from the we couldn't fault it.  Great breakfast, helpful, cheery staff and a pleasing reception with comfortable lounge chairs..  Rooms are good and it has a pool and spa (we didn't have the time to use it but it looked good).  Tea facilities in the room, iron and board, nice toiletries and lovely fluffy white towels.  We'd go back again definitely.",4,2012,04,15
248,"Great family hotel, great location","This hotel has become our hotel of choice every time we visit Dublin. Great family rooms, very good prices, with regular deals available and it's location is perfect for a short walk to city centre. Rooms are spotless, staff very friendly and parking is available and secure (altough limited).Breakfast is buffet but great choice and quality with wide choice available.  We would have no hesitation in recommending this hotel either with or without family! ",4,2012,04,15
248,Good value in good location,Loved the pool which was great for kids - nice room which slept 5 which is unusual in Dublin.  Would recommend.,4,2012,04,14
248,Gem of a Place,"Stayed here for a weekend in April 2012, great hotel with a lovely ambience in the lobby. Highly recommend the restaurant for dinner, everything on the menu looked yum. Bar staff, waitress' etc and majority of reception staff were helpful and friendly ... There is always an exception to the rule - namely a female receptionist who badly needs a training course in customer service and general manners!! 

Rooms were clean and spacious, hot showers but hairdryers are useless ... My advice bring your own!! 

Breakfast was great, plentiful, chefs need to gee-up and cheer-up though, bit of a queue for no apparent reasons. 

Overall great place within easy walk of st Stephens green and shops etc. we will be back. :)))",4,2012,04,13
248,good in many ways,"we have been to the hotel for meeting and lunch etc before and thought its a good place to stay too.

they have free car park for the guests - very rare in city centre. 
but we've got a train this time, luas stop was just outside the hotel but the line doesnt go to/from the station, of cause you can jusy change the line but we walked anyway, and it was far.

the hotel is in nice area with lots of good looking pubs and eating places around, also only 10min walk from temple bar, safe walk too.

staffs are all very helpful and friendly, oue room on 5th floor was clean and confortable.
the bar in the hotel was open till 4am that night and it got a bit noisy outside the room with people going back to their rooms after drinking but i suppose that can not be avoided in any hotels in dublin city centre on a satueday night.

we really like the breakfast there, hot breakfast was average but the choice for continental brealfast was excellent.just that  my tea was the weakest tea i ever had in my life, there were 2 tea bags in my small teapot so i thought may be not much point asking for one more tea bag... 
and its the only probrem i had in this hotel...tea.

there is swimming pool and all that stuff but we didnt use any, we were out most of the time.
we talked to a family with a small girl in a lift and they said the pool was nice and she had good fun. maybe next time we bring our child too.",5,2012,04,13
248,nice and close to the center,"We stayed there just before Easter. Hotel looks good and it is clean.  Very helpful staff. There is free car park for guest and hotel is just about 10 min walk from Grafton Street. Wifi in the rooms, but as we stayed at 5th floor the signal was too weak for my phone to pick up (still ok on the laptop). One of the nights there were some noisy guests on the corridor - enough to wake me up, but went away quickly. There is a gym and restaurant plus food served in the pub. Lots of choices at breakfast, but a bit expensive. Overall good experience.",4,2012,04,12
248,Good choice.. Staff very friendly & helpful.,"Took the notion to head to Dublin for the night with a friend and our son's, aged 4 & 5. We didn't know where to stay but wanted a hotel that was fairly central, with a pool to keep the children entertained. We looked at a few different hotels but based on reviews and location we decided to go with The Camden Court.. Turns out it was a good choice. The accommodation was fine, clean and equipped with the usual..hair dryer, trouser press, iron, tea/coffee making facilities and a decent tv. Food in bistro at lunch time was of a good standard and decent selection but we were told there wasn't a kids menu which we thought a bit strange, our boys shared a regular Thai chicken curry. The pool area was good but we did encounter 1 very unfriendly guest who was annoyed that the pool didn't have a partition for those wanting to swim lengths.. there were several children having fun in the pool at the time (roughly 8am) maybe she was right..but hey... maybe she was just a bit uptight. The hotel has a good, warm atmosphere, with a very comfortable lobby/reception area, where guests were able to relax and do their own thing, access the free WiFi, read the newspapers, enjoy a coffee or other beverage, with subtle, light jazz in the background. The most impressionable part of the stay was definitely the reception staff, Kristian in particular.. He couldn't have been more helpful and friendly, his great personality really shone through and he took time telling us about suitable places to visit with the children.. Having a background in hospitality, I appreciate not everyone is suited to working in a customer facing role, Kristian stood out for his friendliness and professionalism..great guy! added to our stay.. Any employer would love him. I would definitely return to the Camden Court and recommend it to others.",4,2012,04,10
248,"Great Hotel, Great Value","My husband and I stayed at the Camden Court hotel during our stay in Dublin.  The hotel is a short 15 minute walk from the Temple Bar area and has free wifi and free secured parking on site.  If looking for ammenities this hotel has a great gym, spa, and leisure room.  The rooms are very simple but clean.  I would recommend staying at the Camden Court hotel.",5,2012,04,10
248,Great if you’re in the blue rinse brigade or travelling as part of a family...,"Arrived Thursday evening at 23:00, quite tired and very hungry so probably not at our best.  This was not helped by having to wait to be checked in due to a dithering customer taking up the time of the night manager. On the positive, when we were eventually seen by the manager we were checked in quickly and efficiently.  On enquiring about the available room service options, although knowing it was late, the only available option was the dreaded sandwiches! Asked about a local pizza outlet we were advised about one opposite the hotel. Tip don’t try it unless you prefer the taste of litres of cheap vegetable oil and a hint of pizza dough and cheese! 

This hotel in many respects is a really great hotel for only being a 3 star. And we did get it a great rate. They have what appeared to be  a good onsite restaurant, large lounge area, bar and leisure club to boot so if you’re looking to stay within the hotel throughout your stay this could be for you. Unfortunately, even though we’re honestly not that young ourselves, it was like we were stuck in a hotel booked out by Saga Holidays. The lobby/lounge area was comfortable but the music being played throughout was some really oldy-worldy pre-war  jazz which was really awful. We like to have a drink in the bar normally but had a quick look in and decided against it. Even on 1 of the nights we had thought of eating at the restaurant but opted for room service as the sane option !

Our bedroom was good, I think it had recently been refreshed and was quite quiet. It was a shame though that the Hotel had disabled the TV audio in connections and therefore we were unable to connect an MP3  or Ipod.

Customer service was efficient but impersonal. I make this point as being our second visit to Dublin we were expecting the good old Irish charm.

Sorry Camden Court you can guess we will not be returning.",3,2012,04,09
248,Great Irish Experience,"My husband and I stayed at Camden Court Hotel during our week-long stay in Dublin.  We were happily impressed with the friendliness and helpfulness of the staff.

We would stay there again....  :)",5,2012,04,09

248,"good hotel, very nice staff","We have just returned from three nights at the Camden and overall had an excellent stay with two minor quibbles. Firstly, the pool is very nice and a fair size but was very chilly at times as was the hotel room. I called down to say that the room was cold and i couldn't get the radiator on and the staff told me that the heating didn't come on till 7pm. However i can't have been alone in being cold as the heating came on at 5.45 that night! 
The breakfast is well worth paying for and having as prices in Dublin are high and eating a good breakfast meant we could get by until the evening! The selection was excellent and the bacon deserves its own mention!
Although this is a no smoking hotel the first room we were shown had had smokers staying in it and we were moved with no problems and apologies which was appreciated.",4,2012,04,08
248,Lovely hotel and good location,"I travelled to this hotel last weekend with my friend for a short break away in Dublin. The hotel was really nice. The staff were friendly and helpful. The location was good, only a 10 minute walk to st stephen's green. The breakfast was well worth having...lots of choice, cereal, croissants, fresh fruit, cooked breakfast etc. There is a swimming pool and sauna, jacuzzi, steam room in the hotel. Please note that to go into the swimming pool you had to wear a swimming cap although you could use the jacuzzi etc without one! The rooms were nice, clean and quite spacious. The corridors were abit noisy at night time, could hear people getting in late etc but other than that we slept well. If I was ever back in Dublin I would use this hotel again. :-)",4,2012,04,02
248,Warm Irish Welcome??,"Myself and my wife made an impromptue visit to Dublin city in early March traveling from the country side. I liked the look of Camden Hotel so i decided to book a room for the night whilst we went for our wedding anniversary meal. Well was not to be!!! Yes a room  was availible, yes we could afford it, BUT this hotel would not accept our legal tender without a creditcard no. even though (running late for meal at this stage) I offered a deposit(yes that legal tender again!) as security in case I wrecked the room, stole the furnature or whatever else us Irish tourists might do on a one night stay.  I feel this policy is archaic, descriminating and not very in touch with these austere times!! Surely all businesses need to embrase business and not run paying customers away from the door ! Draw your own conclusions.
Our custom was kindly received by the neighbouring Harcourt Hotel where our legal tender was deemed more than adequite!!",1,2012,03,30
248,A warm Irish Welcome,"An warm welcome from very friendly staff. A well placed central hotel for the centre of Dublin, my recently reburbished room was well planned with good quality furnishings, the overall score would have been excellent but for some minor cleaning oversights in the bathroom (debris on the bathroom floor - potentially tile adhesive) and on the back of the bathroom door (dried shampoo/shower gel?), and the fact I had to chase the coffee order at breakfast (minor issues), overall a very good hotel with an impressive reception area, I will definitely stay again and would recommend.",4,2012,03,29
248,one of the best in Dublin,"I would seriously recommend this hotel to anyone the location is great it's on camden street and within walking distance of most of dublins attractions st stephens green,temple bar ect, the foyer is lovely when you arrive and the staff very friendly and professional then up to the room and for a budget hotel its just fabulous the rooms are what you expect if not better for the prices and I had a good nights sleep you can also get breakfast at the hotel but would recommend a small cafe called Yum Yum's about 200 yards up on the left side of the road which the food is great and you'll pay half the price. All in all I would not stay anywhere else when going to dublin which im planing on going in september again also there's a swimming pool which all guests can use you just have to buy a skull cap at the reception or bring your own.",5,2012,03,29
248,Enjoyed our stay,"Camden Court is in a good location within walking distance of Grafton Street and Temple Bar. Our room was clean and comfortable. Parking is complementary, but difficult if your car is bigger than your fist. :) The pool was nice and clean (swim caps required--you can buy one there) though the hot tub was anything but hot. Service at the front desk was good.",4,2012,03,27
248,defo stay here next time,"Me and my boyfriend stayed at camden court hotel on 15th march till 16th march!! it was a fantastic break!!! Lovely staff and great facilities, defo stay here again!! Great location for everything ( make sure you take comfortable shoes, loads of walking ) temple bar is really lively and great atmosphere!!! If you like your shopping and bargins this is the place to go!!! i got a jumpsuit that should have been £60 got for £5 and i got a top FREE!! IDEAL for everybody!!",4,2012,03,25
248,leisure family break,"stayed here on thurs and fri nite to take our son to the premier league darts in the o2 could not have been nicer ...room was newley refurbished very comfortable lovley bar , car secure in the car park and walking distance from grafton street and stephens green for shopping on friday we loved it and highly recommend it and would have and wanted to stay an extra nite but unfortunately they were booked out we will b back....",5,2012,03,24
248,ideal for getting around,"we have just arived back home , having spent 3 days at the camden court hotel.  ok its a ten minute walk into town, or a 1 euro bus ride ( bus 140 plenty ) but the hotel makes up for the small distance. the rooms were plenty large enough, flat screen tv, large wardrobe, big bathroom. and most of all a nice bed.  the breakfast was good , with plenty of choice. the spa area, was good, pool good and clean, with a nice sauna and steam room , all clean and tidy.
the staff were very good, and would help in any way . if you ask, the hotel has safe boxes, all free of charge in the reception. the bar was good, also a nice locals pub next door.",4,2012,03,23
248,"Nice size room, full breakfast, and great amenities","Great location to pubs, eateries, and about 1.5 mile to Temple Bar. In front of the hotel is the Bleeding Horse pub, Devitts pub down the street, and several more if you want to hang out away from the touristy area. We enjoyed hanging out in the lobby area at the hotel because it was a great meeting point for our group and they served food and drinks. The hotel restaurant also serves a full breakfast which was very filling. Our room was clean, a good size room and nice modern bathroom with a tub. We used the sauna, jacuzzi, and steam room located in the basement floor. This hotel has great service and amenities. They can exchange currency, arrange taxi service, and has a large conference area if you came with a large group or for business. I would stay here again when we return to Dublin.",5,2012,03,22
248,Excellent value,"Travelled 16th March St Patrick's weekend, last minute decision to see member of family, so paid over the normal for room & flights, our decision.
Had a double room on the 4th floor, can't fault the hotel and staff were excellent, arrived early morning, the hotel stored our cases until the room was ready, decided to have breakfast across the road in Rhubarb, a 1minute walk from the hotel, traditional breakfast for 5 euro.
Although the hotel was in a slightly seedy but safe area, we loved it, 10 minutes walk into the centre, Temple Bar & Grafton Street, with plenty of eateries to choose from.
Small tip, don't get a taxi from the airport 25-30 euro, just jump on the local bus from the airport 16A and it will cost you 2.30 euro to the city, it dropped us off 2 minutes walk to the hotel.
Did not eat in the hotel as there were so many places to try, but other guests recommended and the prices seemed reasonable. The Bleeding Horse pub next door serves a lovely pint of Guinness.
Will definitely be back for a stay at the Camden Court.",5,2012,03,19
248,Camden Court . . . . spot on again!,"Just been to the Camden Court Hotel for the third time over St. Patrick's weekend. As ever, no complaints . . . . excellent room, breakfast great, lovely Guinness in the bar, and paid no more than any pub in town . . . . the superb Bleeding Horse pub next door. Paid a bit more than we have in the past but we were late booking . . . . definitely worth getting the breakfast included. At the back this time, so nice and quiet as well. Really good staff as well. Just a gentle stroll into the centre is another plus!",5,2012,03,19
248,Warm and Receptive.,"We stayed here overnight on the 18th March 2012 and were impressed by the facilities.
The Hotel is within walking distance of St., Stephen's Green, Grafton St., and Temple Bar. Bus services and Luas Tram Line all connect nearby so no excuse for getting out and about. The rooms are comfortable and very clean and hot water is no problem. The Hotel is very competitive price wise considering all you get in house. The Leisure centre is free to guests and is a well equipped complex. It has a nice restaurant and Bar and all the staff are friendly and helpful.The only problem we had was a ringing phone in our room at four in the morning, one ring only so nothing to moan about. I highly recommend this Hotel for any stay in Dublin.",4,2012,03,19
248,very good,"I often go to Camden Court for my business trips to Dublin. I really like the courtesy of the people working there: they are always available for any request.
The price is very competitive for the serviveces offered by the hotel.
The position is very favourable because it is close to the city centre, to the Dublin nightlife and to the public transportation.
Rooms are confortable and big enough. There is also a swiming pool for those like it.
I think I will keep on going there.",5,2012,03,18
248,Vacation March 2012 Dublin,"Very good place to stay.  Close to everything, food in Hotel is very good and reasonable.
Staff were wonderful, very helpful.",4,2012,03,16
248,"Great hotel, good facilities, excellent location","Had a great weekend at the hotel, facilities were ideal, good location with everything walking distance.

Hotel is well managed and staff all friendly and helpful.",5,2012,03,11
248,Noisy but good,"I stayed here recently for a last minute cheap night when attending a concert in Dublin. 
Small car park, which I eventually squeezed into, with the help of the attendant who organised incoming guests. NOT for the faint hearted!
Check in was prompt, and there was a buzz about the lobby of happy guests. Took a pitstop here for drinks before going up to the room. 
Room was clean, as was bathroom. Carpet and upholstery a little dated, but hey, I'd paid very little for the room, so I wasn't bothered. 
We went to the concert and took the ""long way home"", with several stop offs! We got back just wanting to sleep after a long day & evening. very little sleep was had unfortunately. We were overlooking the busy road, and just as the night time revelers seemed to leave the street, the traffic started. 
All in all, I'd stay again, and would ask for a quieter area to stay. It's convenient to night life, so if sleep is not a priority, go for it. 
We didn't eat here as we had breakfast in town while shopping.",4,2012,03,07
248,Great hotel,"This was a fantastic hotel with great vale for money.  Room was an adequate size and everything worked correctly, a very clean hotel.  Staff were very friendly and helpful.  Would definately stay here again.  Only negative I would have is the bar was quite cold when we had dinner in the bar that evening,however the food was nice. Parking area is quite small.",4,2012,03,06
248,Enjoyable Stay in Dublin,"We stayed in the Hotel at the end of January with two families.  We had two rooms next door which was good for the children.  It would have been nicer to be in one of the newer rooms.  The Kids loved the pool, but the changing area could be cleaner.  The breakfast for very good quality.  The receptionist (I think his name was Kristen) on arrival was very helpful.  The hotel is locations to city centre.",4,2012,03,05
248,"Lovely weekend in Dublin, Fab location","We had a superb stay in this hotel, make sure you get a room facing the back of the hotel as the forward facing ones would be way to noisy. The hotel was nice, staff were great and were able to accommodate us with a late checkout with a bit of an extra charge and we enjoyed the bistro it was great really nice service and food.
The only downside was that there was no aircons available which did not make a difference to us on a mild weekend however during the summer this could be different.
Thanks for a lovely and pleasant stay.",4,2012,03,05
248,Reliable & Comfortable,"I travel to Dublin a couple of times for work and always stay in the Camden Court.

Excellent location just 10 minutes walk from St Stephen's Green.

Hotel staff are lovely.   Rooms are spacious and very comfortable.   Some of the rooms have been refurbished but even if you are not in a refurbished rooms, they are nice enough.

Only disappointing thing I can say about this hotel is that the bar menu has not changed since October.  

The hotel has spa & leisure facilities that look great but I haven't had the time to use them, maybe next time......",4,2012,03,04
248,Lovely Hotel and Excellent Value for Money,"My wife and I recently stayed in this hotel and were well impressed. Check-in was seamless, staff wre very friendly,  and helpful. Room was modern and clean, bathroom was immaculate. Breakfast (served to our room) was substantial and good value for money. Bar had nice ambience and was comparable with city prices. Located within a 10/15 minute walk of shopping and Temple Bar. Although it was only an overnight stay we are looking forward to using this hotel in the future and would have no hesitation in recommending it.",5,2012,03,03
248,Lovely Hotel with great pool,"The hotel has a very impressive lobby, bar and restaurant. Prices in the restaurant err on the expensive side. We ate in the hotel bar instead and were really impressed with the quality and presentation of the food, and the portions were a decent size. Drinks, as with most of Dublin city centre are more expensive than the average. There is a lovely pool, however you do have to wear a swimming cap to go in it which can be purchased for 2 euros 50 cents. You don't need to wear the swim cap to use the sauna, steam room or jacuzzi. The staff were all really friendly.  Camden Street is in a less salubrious part of town and there were a few homeless people there. About 100 metres up from the hotel (on Camden Street) is a locals pub called Devitts which has the best live folk music on thursdays, fridays and saturdays from 9.30 onwards. The music is played up on the first floor and it is a gathering of musicians who are incredibly talented in the violin, accordian, flute etc and some amazing singers belting out irish folk songs. They also have a weekly cheap beer, the week we were there Truborg was 3 euros 50.",4,2012,03,03
248,Leap Year in Dublin,"Camden Court is in an excellent location.  Direct transport from the airport on bus 16A for about 2 Euro.  Excellent housekeeping staff.  Close to shopping, great restaurants, Temple Bar.  WiFi free.  The pool, sauna and steam room were excellent and at no extra cost.",5,2012,03,01
248,Great Location. Very Nice Hotel.,"The Camden Court is a very nice hotel in a great location in Dublin. Walking distance from Stephens Green, Temple Bar etc. Car parking is available and free to guests. Breakfast and dinner was excellent, staff were helpful and pleasant. Used the pool which was very nice. Gym looked well equipped but didn't use it. All in all we enjoyed our stay. Would recommend to anyone visiting that part of Dublin.",4,2012,02,29
248,Really Nice Hotel,"Hotel approx 20 min walk from Temple Bar, and 15 min from the High Street Shops.  Tram does stop outside, but you are the 2nd to last stop anyway 
Really good hotel, clean, great buffett breakfast, bar and food good, comparable prices with the rest of the Dublin hotels.  Gym and pool good, fish pedicures and other treatments good, and well priced.  Staff freindly and helpful in booking taxi's and storing bags prior to departing for airport.  Pub next door to hotel which is lively, and a few clubs that are really close 
Enjoyed my stay in Dublin - thank you!",4,2012,02,28
248,Gets better every time,"I have stayed in this hotel a few times over the past couple of years and at this stage I really love it - decor has improved and I am surprised at how well the standard is maintained for such a big and busy hotel. The reception area is lovely and pristinely kept, the room lovely and very relaxing and staff are very helpful. It is a great location for the city and really good price wise. Will continue to stay here when I stay in Dublin.",4,2012,02,27
248,"Nice hotel in a nice district, short walk into the city with some great bar's/restaurant's around","Stayed with my wife 20-23rd Feb 2012. Some really good things about this place plus a few challenges. I like the location. 10 mins to Grafton St, 15 mins to Temple Bar. Loved the bars and restaurants on Lower Camden Street. Loved the reception and restaurant area. Loved the free wifi. The staff were friendly and good. 

On the flip side, the room when we arrived was really cold and the window was open. The radiator was adjustable and turned off. It then stayed on and the room gradually warmed up over the first 2 days. The heating must have then been switched off, (in Feb)? On the 3rd night we got back from a night out and the room was really cold. It was after midnight and I asked for a heater which was delivered. They were unsure as to if they'd have any left though so felt like a bigger issue for the hotel. 

Breakfast was really nice but they ran out of some of the nicer stuff. Mainly smoked salmon and ham. Finally it's on a busy road so expect a bit of noise from the road.",4,2012,02,24
248,Lovely hotel,"I am so relieved to have found this hotel. I travel to Dublin a fair bit with work and struggle to find affordable good quality hotels which provide a quiet night !

The hotel has a lovely pool and jacuzzi which is free to guests and the beauty treatments were fab - the lady was really professional and friendly. 

Would definitely stay again !",5,2012,02,24
248,Very Nice Hotel,Stayed in this hotel about a year ago. Rooms are very nice and the staff very helpful. We were attending a dinner in Dublin so this hotel was very convienient and the prices were good too. Free wifi also which is always a plus.,5,2012,02,24
248,Fantastic Hotel Pity about the Noise!,"My Husband and I had travelled down to a concert, at a venue near the hotel.

The staff were lovely, and the rooms beautiful, I dont think I have a bad word to say about them, even the breakfast was fantastic. 

The only one complaint I would have is that around 4 in the morning we were awoken but noisey adults running up and down the corridor, this went on for at least an hour, shouting and screaming at the tops of their voices, which to me was not necessary consider this was the middle of the week and I am sure many business persons were staying their. 

I am unsure if the hotel has a night porter, but surely he / she would have see these larger loughts when they arrived in the door! In the end I had to ring down and some one came up and then their was silence. 

Apart from that everything else was fine and I would stay here again as its in a great location to with an underground capark..",5,2012,02,22
248,New find in dublin,"Usually I stay in the same few hotels when in Dublin but this time broke the mould and stayed here. I was pleasantly surprised by how quiet it was for a centrally located hotel. The car park was free and so was the wifi so I was already happy before seeing my room which was not small at all and at the back of the hotel. The wifi it has to be said is a little off and on but hey, it's free. The breakfast was not out of the ordinary yet there was a fair amount of choice. I loved the fake 100 euro note offered by the hotel to write a good review on TripAdvisor and it nearly made me write a bad review but now with some distance (about a week) I think the hotel and its friendly staff deserve praise. The location is great for cafés, restaurants (the nearby Indian is great) and shops and pubs although not a smart area of Dublin. It's a 20 minute walk to Grafton St. I took a Taxi and it took 5mins and cost 7 euro. Will stay here again!",4,2012,02,20
248,Suprisingly city centre,Got a great deal on Lidl Breaks- 30 euro per person sharing (with breakfast) for 4 nights. Free parking is an extra bonus. Breakfast was generous with something for all tastes (lovely fresh fuit salad). Rooms were roomy and warm. It's about a 10 minute walk to the edge of St Stephen's Green and from there the city is at your feet. Overall a great deal with no complaints.,4,2012,02,20
248,Good location and nice accommodations,"My husband and I stayed at the Camden Court Hotel July 3-6, 2011. We rented a car and, after a rough go at driving on the opposite side of the street with very few street signs to aid us in navigating our way through Dublin, by some miracle we managed to find the hotel. Thankfully parking was included, and we didn't have to touch our car even once during our stay. The accommodations were clean and nice, and the staff was very helpful and friendly. The hotel was conveniently located and the weather was beautiful, so we walked EVERYWHERE ... really only grabbing a cab for a trip to the Guinness Brewery. Speaking of brew, the pub next door to the hotel is a great place to grab fish and chips and a pint after a busy day walking the city!",4,2012,02,19
248,"Great Hotel, great location","The hotel is great, the staff is very courteous and made my stay a very pleasant one.",4,2012,02,19
248,Lovely Hotel,I stayed in the Camden Court hotel for 5 nights while attending a work event and it is such a nice hotel. The reception staff were very efficient with check in and were very friendly. The room itself was lovely and very comfortable. The room service was also very prompt and the room charge was reasonable. The location is good but could be a little to difficult to find if you don't know the area. The area is nice and quiet in comparision to other Dublin city centre hotels but is still very close to the centre of Dublin.,5,2012,02,17
248,Nice hotel with a pool and close to the city centre,"Myself and my wife and our small baby have just returned from a short stay in this hotel.  We had a great time there.  All of the staff were very friendly, very helpful and all of our requests were dealt with.  We did not dine there but heard that the food is very good too.  The room was very comfortable.  The pool and leisure centre were a real luxury for such a good hotel so close to the very city centre.",5,2012,02,16
248,"Terrific Value, Great location, Clean and comfortable","The title says it all. Great location, 5 minute walk to Stephens green.. Comfortable, clean room and excellent breakfast. Swimming pool and free car parking to boot. Couldn't ask for more at the price. Definitely will be back.",4,2012,02,14
248,Fine hotel; pity about the location,"I stayed here for three nights whilst attending a conference elsewhere in Dublin. Rooms were spacious, clean, and service was friendly. Free Wi-Fi a bonus, and would certainly stay here again. I'd also recommend visiting a pub, 'The Bleeding Horse', just next door. 

HOWEVER - I did find the hotel a bit of a trek from downtown Dublin, along a road which isn't the most pleasant, especially at night.

Otherwise, a fine hotel.",4,2012,02,14
248,excellent service,"Having travelled on the overnight ferry we arrived at the hotel at 7.00 a.m..We were planning to leave our luggage with the hotel but we were surprised and delighted to be told that our room was available and we could check in. This made the whole day very much easier for us and provided a level of service which would not be offered in very many more expensive establishments. The room was both comfortable and extremely clean. Breakfast was good and  a relaxing experience (no queues, tables cleared quickly and ample staff in attendance). We also used the excellent leisure centre several times. This also was clean and well maintained with helpful staff. Both the pool and jacuzzi were kept at good temperatures. All in all this hotel made for a most enjoyable and relaxing stay in a central location in Dublin city. We will most certainly be staying again in the Camden Court and to top it all Wales won the rugby match which was the object of our trip !",5,2012,02,07
248,Lovely Stay,"Stead here for 2nights back in Jan on bed + breakfast basic .Only 10 mins walk from shops and round the  corner from the  famous ""Coppers Niteclub""  that all us  culchies talk about .
Rooms - Nice 
The breakfast set up in the morning is fab , a great variety loved it  . We ate in the bar the  the second night I went for the home made hamburger and chips and it was yum , my friend had a Chicken fillet burger and it was yummy 2 . 
We also went for a fish pedicure in the leisure center (something different ) .Thanks to the lovely guy working (wore glasses , cant think of your name ) he even made us coffee while we were having our pedicures  .Leisure centre itself is lovely .
Couldn't fault this hotel",5,2012,02,06
248,Not too bad for city hotel,"Stayed here, got a good deal, meal etc inclusive. 
The room was nice. We were at the front of the hotel. If you are a light sleeper ask for one at the back as you might get woken up by people walking from the clubs late at night.
The breakfast was brilliant. really impressed.
We had bar food and again at the restaurant, but I honetsly wasnt blown away by this food. It was lackign somewhat. The staff are very friendly and the gym is nice. 
It is night right beside the city, taikes a 15 min walk, aothough you could just grab a bus outside.",4,2012,02,06
248,Camden Court Hotel Dublin,Enjoyed one night stay at this hotel. Staff very welcoming and extremely helpful. Wonderful location for shopping and nightlife. Room clean and comfortable. Staff in hotel bar friendly and helpful.Not at all noisy at night. My only negative comment is the price and mediocre quality of the breakfast. Tried the Bleeding Horse pub next door for food-excellent pub. Would definitely stay again.,4,2012,02,02
248,Stay here!,"If there is a nicer, better value hotel in Dublin I would love to know where it is! The Camden Court is in an excellent location just 10 minutes walk from Grafton Street. Camden Street is really buzzy and has lots of cool bars. Other hotels within five minutes walk are double the price! I have stayed here with my three year old son and with some girls for a weekend and it is suited to both styles of break. Some of the rooms have been recently refurbed and are very nice. Overall the hotel is spotlessly clean, warm and stylish Best of all it is quiet with no banging and shouting after hours.There is an excellent spa and plenty of FREE, secure parking - in a city centre this is unheard of! The breakfast is lovely and the staff are very pleasant. If you are planning a break in Dublin stay here!",5,2012,01,31
248,FAB,"Really Impressed with this hotel, Great Location.  Staff were extermely eager to please and were v helpful.   For the price we got the room for I could not fault it - I had asked for an extra cot bed to be put into the room as had children with us, And to my supprise it was actually a real bead that was put it - Great Value for Money.  Breakfast was delicious. Next time I am in Dublin I will be stayig here again.",5,2012,01,31
248,quality hotel,"excellent hotel located 10mins walk from graton street and about 15mins to Templebar area.  hotel was a large foyer which is very relaxing and the rooms are very clean and spacious.  buffet breakfast is very nice with food cooked freshly.  nice bar just off reception and staff are friendly.  hotel is less than 5 minute walk from Copperface Jacks nightclub.

excellent hotel and would recommend to anyone.",5,2012,01,30
248,Weekend Visit,"This is a lovely city centre hotel which is extremely suitable for weekend breaks. The reception area is spacious, the seating is comfortable and the staff were very welcoming. We parked the car in the underground car park - a note of warning - it is small and very tight even for a small car which mine wasn't. Our bedroom was spotlessly clean and tastefully furnished. Breakfast was warm and tasty. We also took the opportunity to have an evening meal in the hotel and we were very impressed with the cuisine. All in all the pleasant stay in this hotel contributed to a very good weekend in Dublin. We would recommend it to our friends.",4,2012,01,30
248,VERY IMPRESSED!,"We stayed here this weekend, and we were very impressed.  The rooms are basic but clean, comfortable and spotless.  The staff are lovely everywhere. reception, housekeeping, bar and restaurant.  The breakfast was delicious.  Really good quality food.  And the staff were happy to provide extra pots of tea to our table.  Would recommend this hotel for anyone, young or old.
We will definitely return.  Well done!!!!",5,2012,01,29
248,Excellent stay in Dublin centre,"HI,

The hotel is really nice. The room has everything you normally need, the staff is helpful, the hotel has a well equipped gym & a swimming pool and a free wifi. I've stayed in this hotel for over 2 months altogether and must say that it's one of the best hotels I've been to (note: I don't visit Hilton type 5 stars hotels a lot though :) 

The location is very convenient, just 10 minutes walk from Grafton Street, with a nice pub in the hotel's building, bus stop and Dublin Bike stand nearby.

One tip: when registering, ask for one of the renovated rooms - the difference isn't massive, but they're slightly nicer.",5,2012,01,28
248,"Lovely Hotel, great staff, Great location","Lovely hotel, great facilities.  it was a shame our room overlooked a car park, but we were in the city centre so not too disappointed.  Our soom ws spotless but plain nothing spectular.  Breakfast was not included & at E80 it really should be.  Had to call housekeeping for an iron/ironing board as they are not in the room, and for more towels as the 'bath' towels are tiny! but the lady who brought them was really nice and friendly.  The bathroom was spotless.  I was expecting more from the room at E80 per night. but you can't beat the location  great access to Grafton Street for shopping and to St Stephens Green.  A one minute walk to harcourt street for the clubs & a great night out.  We didnt have our breakfast here as it was E13 .... way overpriced! We went to Grafton Street and got the same full Irish for E5.....  Overall was pleased with the hotel.",4,2012,01,25
248,excellent,"excellent  hotel,would stay again , great facilities. good  location .fruiendly staff.",5,2012,01,24
248,Good hotel,"Hotel in good location,20 min walk to Temple Bar area and same for Guiness Storehouse,Grafton Street even closer.Room was clean with tea/coffee and leisure facilities good.Staff very friendly and helpful.Stayed room only,breakfast at cafe near hotel was half the price the hotel charged.Ate at the Whitefriars restaurant 1 night and Ceasar's italian the other night and would recommend both.Bleeding Horse pub next door but we never heard any noise from this.Canal is 5 min walk away which is good for clearing the head after a late night out.",4,2012,01,23
248,Good Dublin Hotel Clopse but far enough away,"The Camden Court Hotel ( be careful not to book the Hostel opposite) great hotel if you have a car as free parking. It takes about 15 mins to walk to Temple bar, if you want that. One great attraction for the hotel is the bar next door ( Bleeding Horse Pub/Pub Grub). (The rooms are all fine and clean) Very noce spot if you ask me. Always get a taxi back from city though.",4,2012,01,22
248,Excellent hotel- Worth every cent!,"I booked this hotel to stay with a group of 10 other girls. When I rang the hotel, we got a much better deal than was offered on any website. The staff were great. We arrived early and it wasn't checking in time. Our luggage was kept in the safe room while we went to get something to eat. The food was delicious and the bar man kept us entertained. The desserts were gorgeous. Quick and helpful service. 

Our room was a triple room and we could easily have fitted another double bed in it. So spacious. Room was lovely, clean, warm and welcoming. Bathroom was a great size- big enough for 3 girls to get ready for  a night out in! 

I have nothing negative to say about The Camden Court Hotel. If I am ever staying in Dublin again, this is the hotel I will be staying in.",5,2012,01,19
248,Still as good,"I stayed here a year or so ago and it suited our needs perfectly (we attend a course in the area from time to time). Our second stay last week was every bit as successful. A particular mention for the reception staff who are always pleasant, cheerful and efficient. The room was nice and quiet, and spotless. Just that very faint lingering smell of cigarette smoke in the bedding...same as just about every hotel I've ever stayed in, and not enough to keep me awake. We bring our own breakfast since we only have cereal and fruit anyway - can't justify the extra €20. My only minor complaint is that I find €79 is expensive for room only for a 3* hotel in January. I wish they did some cheaper advance booking deals  - they do for some weekdays, but not weekends it seems. But, as I said last time, they don't charge for parking (a big plus for us) so it's swings and roundabouts.  The course is on again soon so I'll be keeping me eye on the Camden Court website for the best deal.",4,2012,01,19
248,Great hotel,"I stayed here with my wife for a two day getaway to Dublin in Jan 2012. Rates were considerably cheaper than other hotels in Dublin and the location suited us. The facilities were excellent, Free Parking, Free WIFI and it has a swimming pool and gym. The room was spacious and had all we needed including tea and coffee making facilities, ironing board, tv, toiletries as in all good hotels. It was clean and comfortable. The hotel is in an ideal spot for walking into St. Steven's Green and public transport is also available nearby. My wife needed a needle and thread and this was arranged and delivered to room immediately. The hotel exceeded my expectations and I was impressed from with the staff the were friendly and offered help when needed.  I will be back.",5,2012,01,18
248,Good for a short break in Dublin,"I stayed here with friends for a quick two day getaway to Dublin in December.
Rates were considerably cheaper than other hotels in Dublin on Expedia and I my expectations were not very high. The hotel exceeded my expectations and I was impressed from walking in to the lobby which was very well maintained. Reception staff were friendly and offered help when needed. Security on the door at night time was good.
Room had tea and coffee facilities and toiletries which is always a good touch. The only problem I had was the lack of T.V channels (or maybe I wasn't working the TV properly??) and also I think the rooms could do with a touch up (wallpaper/paint was becoming to look slightly untidy and everything was plain white which made it appear rather basic and travelodge-ish).
Overall, I would stay here again and would recommend young people to who are going to Dublin for a night out.",4,2012,01,17
248,Great value and Location,"I stayed here for 2 nights in January. Room was clean and comfortable. Staff were extremely helpful and friendly. 

The hotel is located near Stephan's Green so is in a great location. Highly Recommended!",5,2012,01,16
248,Fantastic Value for a Saturday night in Dublin,"I stayed for one night with my husband and 2 children.  The facilities were excellent, Free Parking, Free WIFI and a super pool with kids pool also.  The room for the 4 of us was spacious and had all we needed.  It was clean and comfortable.  The hotel is in an ideal spot for walking into St. Steven's Green and also options of public transport just nearby. The staff were friendly and we will definitely be back.",5,2012,01,15
248,Central hotel with helpful staff,"I stayed for one night, I thought the hotel had excellent facilities such as free wifi and free gym and pool usage. The staff were friendly and knowledgable and the rooms were well decorated as well as being well equipt. Real value for money!",5,2012,01,14
248,Nice family hotel,"Stayed for a week at Camden Court.  Basic rooms.  Clean.  Bathroom was clean.  Nice window that opens for fresh air.  Very lovely staff.  The girls at reception couldn't have been nicer.  Breakfast was a little confusing the first day - and I think they might need additional staff in the restaurant during breakfast.  Basically - once you check in to the restaurant, find a place to sit and then go get your food.  The wait staff will come by - eventually - with coffee and tea.  Don't sit and wait for that.  Just get started with eating.  My son and husband were thrilled with the hot items offered.  The pool and fitness area in the basement are lovely.  You must purchase a bathing cap from the pool office before going in.  I think it was 2 euro.  Lovely clean pool area.  Nice hotub and sauna.  My son loved it (he was 11 at the time).  Fantastic pub next door to the hotel.  Crazy horse, I think.  Great food.  And also across the street - a lovely diner type place with brilliant food.  Also - about 3 doors down - there is a TESCO supermarket - so if you want to stock up on snacks/water - very convenient.  All in all, a lovely place for the price.  Enjoy!",4,2012,01,12
248,Courts the Visitor,"After spending several New Year's holidays in London, this year we traveled to Dublin and found a new favorite.The Camden Court Hotel courts its patrons with excellent service, friendly
staff, and comfortably-appointed rooms. Newly refurbished, the  spacious lobby combines fashionable, contemporary style encased in the classic brick exterior, a microcosm of modern and historic Dublin. Breakfast fare in The Iveagh Dining Room is fresh and well-served, accompanied by a gleaming fire which creates an atmosphere both cozy and expansive. Proximity to St. Stephen's Green and environs provides a desirable location for exploring Dublin by foot or bus. We'll return to Dublin and especially to Camden Court as soon as possible!",5,2012,01,11
248,Great first place to stay in Ireland.,"This was the first hotel we stayed in on our trip to Ireland. I was pretty impressed with the lobby and the lobby staff...very friendly.  The rooms are modest, but comfortable and the price was great. If there has to be a downside, it was a little bit of a walk from our bus drop off, but completely worth it!",5,2012,01,09
248,Will go again,"Great place to stay.  Clean rooms. Great breakfast. Reasonable priced menu. Best swimming, jacuzzi, etc we have been in for a long time, very clean and atmospheric. Friendly staff throughout hotel. Suitable for business, pleasure, families etc. Free parking which is great as you can leave car and walk, catch bus or Luas, which saves a fortune on city car parking prices.",5,2012,01,07
248,You don’t need a four leaf clover if you stay at Camden Court.,"As you’re lucky enough to receive great service, a wonderful reception desk that will do anything to help make your stay special and you're only a short walk away from Grafton Street; by far one of my favorite hotels that I’ve ever stayed at and I travel five times a year.",5,2012,01,06
248,"Lovely hotel, Great location","We have just had a week at camden court hotel during new year and it was fantastic, Hotel was lovely with very freiendly & helpfull staff, Rooms were a nice size and very clean, food was very nice in the main dinning room, We Would Recommend the C Central Bar which is joined to the hotel,Great Food, Great Guinness & Very friendly staff. You also get use of the Jacuzzi,Sauna,Steam Room & Swiiming pool which we used on the last night, it finished are holiday of perfectly.
If we come back to Dublin we will stay here.
P.S Room Service Breakfast is good :)",5,2012,01,05
248,"Comfortable, relaxing and affordable","Very clean, huge bed and good facilities. The service was great in the bar as was the food. 
We couldn't take breakfast in the restaurant as we had one person in our party the had special dietary requirements and couldn't eat from the buffet; however the restaurant manager wouldn't allow him to sit with the rest of us (8 in total) unless he paid the 13euro charge. As a result we all went to a nearby cafe, all had the breakfast we wanted, received great service and saved ourselves around 50 euros. 
I recommend the hotel, but for breakfast try Brioche down on the road on Aungier Street.",4,2012,01,02
248,Excellent value for money,"I will most certainly be returning to this hotel hopefully in the summer. When we arrived the room was a bit on the cold side (heating did not come on to 4.00pm) but one phonecall to reception and within minutes they gave us a portable heater. Room was very comfortable,staff helpful and friendly.Within a short walking distance to Grafton Street. Highly recommend this hotel.",5,2012,01,02
248,Don't bother unless it's for the location,"We stayed at the Camden Court for the second time (6th & 7th night in a month) and the first stay was great- good service although a dated room (very old and tired) However, during our second stay the service was appalling. Everything was a bother or not possible- staff were completely disinterested & the noise was terrible from the pub downstairs despite me asking for a room away from the pub (as we were traveling with two young children and about to embark on our long haul journey home.) It really wouldn't have taken much effort as the hotel wasnt full. The only reason people stay here is due to the location, the breakfast, the gym and pool bc it's all pretty ordinary otherwise.",2,2011,12,29
248,Good location - but average hotel,"We stayed here for one night.  The room was a bit drab and old-fashioned, but it was clean and comfortable.  The hotel staff were friendly and helpful.  Overall it was OK.",3,2011,12,26
248,First Class - Great Location,"Wife and I stayed three nights b and b at the Camden Court in December 2011. Room was well maintained, roomy and modern, breakfast first class and all staff friendly and helpful. During our stay in Dublin visited Garden of Remembrance, War Memorial Gardens and walks around St Stevens Green and the Grand Canal plus shops and markets, great Christmas atmosphere. The location of the hotel is ideal and is good value.",5,2011,12,25
248,Don't stay here if you actually want to sleep,"First night was ok apart from the horrendous noise from the radiators which woke me every hour. On the second night we were given a different room where there was no radiator noise but i could not stop itching in bed. I pulled back the covers to find tiny black hairs in the bed which looked like a previous guest had been shaving in the bed. The sheets had obviously not been changed.
We had a drink in the bar and the glasses were dirty. 
Free parking, but don't park at the front as drunk people had covered our car in cigarette ash, vomit and rubbish.
On our 2nd night we ended up leaving at 2am due to the dirty bed, our car being trashed and constant noise. We complained and were met with no apology at all.",1,2011,12,23
248,what a great hotel,"my daughter and i stayed at the Camden Court in december 2011. we really enjoyed our visit. firstly the staff are friendly, helpful and genuinely nice. secondly the location is ideal for shopping. the luas is 2 mins walk and grafton street maybe 5 or 6 mins. the food was lovely. we chose to have dinner in the hotel and could barely manage the freshly cooked breakfast the following morning. i will certainly stay here again.there was a lot of seasonal revelry on the street in the early morning but this was not the fault of the hotel.",4,2011,12,23
248,Outdated Rooms but Excellent location & Staff...,"I had a great stay at the Camden Court hotel. As this hotel is quite old the decor of the rooms are quite outdated despite this the room & bathroom where SPOTLESS! Great view from our room and the hotel is located right in the centre of Dublin city. No need for taxis. Had a delicious breakfast the next day, which was service by the most friendliest faces in Dublin",4,2011,12,20
248,Room awful.,"My wife & I stayed at the Camden Court Hotel, Dublin for 4 nights end of September 2011. I stayed at the hotel dozens of times in the 90s & early 00s and loved it. We stayed there this time because of the gym & swimming pool which are rare in Dublin centre hotels. Staff brilliant, public areas great, swimming pool excellent but gym now very tatty. Great location too with a brilliant pub next door called the Bleeding Horse. We were given a disabled room for 4 nights & a smoking room when neither of us are disabled and we asked for non-smoking and we know the hotel wasn't full. The furniture is the same as it was 12 years ago, so is the telephone etc.. Staggeringly the only 4 electric sockets were under the desk but right up against the desk top so to dry our hair we had to lie on the floor!!! This was a disabled room! Utterly impossible for someone who is disabled to deal with this I imagine. In other words this room was so outdated that if it isn't updated in the next 5 years they should keep it as a museum piece. Nothing wrong with the size of the room. I don't normally bother with reviews borne out by the fact that it is now mid-December & our stay was late September & I don't have a go at receptionists - pointless. Whilst we were there over the 4 days several coach tours checked-in. 2 of the tour guides had to deal with Americans ranting about their rooms. We know because the rows went on outside our door so it wasn't just our room! In short there are plenty of modern hotels in Dublin that knock spots off the Camden Court nowadays (sadly) & are cheaper. I reiterate the staff were great.",2,2011,12,13
248,Great Stay,A welcome return visit to the Camden Court.  As always great service and food and a warm welcome on arrival.  Ideal spot close to local sights and Grafton Street.  Would recommend for business or leisure.,4,2011,12,12
248,great customer service,"we stayewd for 4 nights at this property and although we had to leave early for tours, they had a special continental breakfast waiting for the 4 of us 1 hour before normal operation hours.  The rooms were great and spacious and bathrooms large and convenient.  The location was convenient and I would recommend this property",4,2011,12,09
248,Will stay here again,"Great hotel, from the time of arrival we were welcomed at reception. Our flight was early in the morning and they still managed to find us a room at 10am which was great. We ate breakfast and plenty of choice cold and hot. The room was a twin with plenty of room and a modern flat screen TV. Its a 10/15min walk to town so good excercise, great location. Will be returning in a few months and will definitely stay here again.",5,2011,12,07
248,One of my favourite places to stay in Dublin,For value and southside central location this is one of the best hotels in Dublin. It not only has a great location just off Harcourt St but it has free parking available and a swimming pool/leisure centre. The staff are very nice and helpful and there are a lot of rooms so can usually get a room at a good rate. I have stayed here on 4 or 5 occasions and will definitely stay again.,4,2011,11,30
248,Brilliant Hotel,We stayed here on a weekend before Christmas 2011 and we found the hotel to be splendid in every way; beautiful equipped rooms and leisure centre and beautiful breakfasts each morning. Highly recommended. Very centrally located in Dublin.,5,2011,11,30
248,Great location & value for money - Quality Accommodation,"We recently stayed at the Camden Court and were again delighted with the standard of service and accommodation on offer. The rate was exceptional value, and the free parking is a real bonus for a Dublin city centre hotel. The rooms are real quality and well decorated",4,2011,11,30
248,Very impressive!,"Stayed here with my wife for one night. 1st thing that impressed me was the free hotel parking, a rarity in Dublin!! We then entered the hotel to a fabulous reception area, which looked very festive with the Christmas decorations on display! It was quite late in the evening when we arrived, but the very friendly girl on reception booked us in quickly and without any fuss.
The bedroom was standard enough but warm clean and comfy so no complaints there and at €75 a night for 2 people was a bargain too!!
Didn't eat in the hotel, as we were going out, but the full restaurant looked to be popular. We did have a drink in the bar, and I found it cheap enough (roughly €7.50 for a pint of Heineken and a diet coke)
All in all, I'd recommend this hotel as its fairly central to all you'd need in Dublin and at a good price!",4,2011,11,28
248,"Excellent location, excellent value for money","I have stayed in the Camden Court a number of times over the years and their standards seem to keep on improving.

The lobby is welcoming to walk into and the reception staff are efficient and friendly.  The family rooms have enough room and clearly a lot of effort has been put into the leisure centre.

It's not big but they manage to squeeze in an 18m pool, a children's pool, hot tub, sauna and steam room.  My memory of the leisure centre was of it being a bit dank so somebody must have been working hard on it as everything was really clean and in good repair.  I was very pleased with it and it was a definite hit with my 4 year old daughter.  

The only slight negative it the traffic noise ... but you are in the centre of a major city so I can forgive that.",5,2011,11,28
248,A great choice,"Positive: I stayed in the Camden Court Hotel on a Friday evening with a friend of mine and I have to say it was a great choice. The room was spotless, I personally couldn't fault it - the location of the room was good too with no noise from the outside traffic and the hotel guests. It was really enjoyable to have access to the pool and jacuzzi (which by the way, had convenient opening times). I personally got a very good rate from a booking website, which was apparently much lower to what the hotel is allowed to charge. 
Remarks: It would have been nice to have a wifi access but I didn't manage to get it. I believe you need to subscribe to a BT service. I personally find the breakfast rates a bit high (13€/person) so I decided to go to one of the numerous coffee places around.
Overall, I'll definitely consider it again for my next trip to Dublin.",5,2011,11,28
248,Perfect location for Exploring Dublin,"Great hotel in a great location for discovering Dublin. A couple of minutes walk from Stephens Green and Grafton Street. A fine combination of spacious, clean and modern bedrooms,  helpful and friendly staff together with excellent restaurant and bar made my stay very pleasurable. Already planning my next stay.",5,2011,11,26
248,Great place to stay,"Being a corporate customer i've practically lived in the hotel for the last 4 years or so (at least one or two nights every week). The fact that I am taking the time to sit and write a review on tripadvisor (first time) is evidence enough that I think this is just about the best place to stay in Dublin when you factor in location, price, quality of service etc. I can't think of any other hotels in Dublin which could beat it (and I've stayed in lots).

Location - It is literally a 5 minute stroll to Grafton Street where you have everything you could want on hand, shopping, entertainment, restaurants, pubs.

Value - Exteremely reasonable rates in comparison to the other hotels which are as close to the city centre

Facilities - It is the only hotel that I know which is so close to the City Centre that has a Gym, a Pool, Sauna, Steam Room and Jacuzzi. For someone like me who has to stay in hotels for at least half the working week this has been an absolute lifesaver. Similarly, when I have stayed in the hotel on social visits having a pool onsite is great for the kids.

Food - The food is very good in terms of both value and quality, it speaks volumes that I had my pick of eateries at the hotels doorstep but most often choose to eat in the hotel.

Staff - I can't speak highly enough of the staff, obviously as I have stayed there over such a long period I got to know them pretty well but thats the point I guess, the staff take the time to get to know you which makes all the difference when you spend half your week away from home. I have stayed in too many hotels where (unintentionally i'm sure) it is a transactional type interaction with the staff, which is fine, you want something, they provide it, but thats it, functional, in the Camden Court you will find that the staff have a personal touch, they will take the time to ask you how you enjoyed the show or the restaurant or the bar you asked them to recommend, they'll crack a joke, things like that probably are small but when you are staying in hotels long term they make all the difference.

Overall I couldn't recommend the hotel highly enough, it is a home away from home which is about the best compliment I could pay it. It no longer feels like I am staying in a hotel when I stay there.

Unfortunately i'll not be staying there in the near future but I know i'll be back sooner rather than later as its the first place i'll look for when business or pleasure takes me back to Dublin.",5,2011,11,24
248,Swimmingly,"Comfortable, clean, complete.  Very nice breakfast.  Nice swimming pool and hot tub (not luxurious but good for a reasonably priced city centre hotel).  Bedroom furniture is a bit basic but it is ok.  Comfortable beds and bedding.  TV is small (but I didn't use it anyway). Good en-suite (but I used leisure centre shower).  No safety deposit box.  Good rates.  Nice staff.  Very central with lots of cafes etc neaby.  15 minutes walk to city centre.  Residents bar is fine.  Nice pub next door.  I would stay there again if I was traveling on my own or wanted a reasonably priced break.",4,2011,11,24
248,Wish the rooms matched the lobby!,"We stayed here on holiday in November on a driving tour throughout Ireland. In comparison to our hotels in Killarney and Galway, this was second or third. The breakfast is good at this hotel, as is the leisure center and pool. The C Central Bistro has excellent food and service and I would recommend dining here to other travelers who want a great meal and to venture away from traditional Irish greasy pub food (try the lamb kofkas - amazing). 
I was disappointed to find that in two different rooms we were given (one the first night of our trip, the second on our last) that they were paltry in comparison to the grandeur of the lobby. The lobby is so welcoming, warm and upscale - but the rooms looked second rate. the carpeting and furnishings could use an udpate. Our second room was much bigger than the first with just a double bed instead of a double and 1 single bed, but I wonder if we were given rooms that had yet to be updated (I read in other reviews before coming that some had been renovated and were beautiful). 
The parking is free, which is a great benefit in the city. We were able to find spaces just behind the hotel both times and the front desk will validate your ticket prior to departure. Our travel companions had to park in a lower deck and got the last space available one night, which made me wonder - what will they do if that overflows? 
We went to the Bleeding Horse Pub which is almost attached to the front of the hotel on Thursday night for drinks and fun. The bar staff was friendly and the atmosphere was great. Not rowdy, but I felt like we got a good Irish Pub experience, although there was no live music. 
The hotel is within walking distance of the Temple Bar, Grafton Street, St. Patrick's Cathedral and if you're brave, the Guinness Storehouse and The Jameson Distillery/O'Connell Street Bridge. We're in our late twenties/early thirties and enjoy walking and experiencing the city, and also wanted to avoid paying for parking in Dublin and the traffic - walking was a much better option for us. There are great Indian and Japanese restaurants down the street from the hotel towards Temple Bar. Try the Bald Barista on Camden Street - voted best coffee in Dublin and totally worth it. Try the food there too for any meal including dessert, well worth it! 
There is free wi-fi here at the hotel and it works well, you just need a password. All in all, it's a good location outside of the busy Temple Bar area and an okay value. I'm hoping for an update to all of the rooms soon.",3,2011,11,22
248,Cutting corners in little ways.,"I've stayed here for many years, and I guess the economic bad times are starting to pinch. The building and room are just as nice as they always have been, but I've noticed that the little details are slipping. We asked for an extra bath towel, which they brought -- and then took it away and did not replace it. The croissants at breakfast were not strictly fresh, and some of the slots in one toaster didn't toast. The ""bath and shower gel"" you get doesn't smell particularly pleasant. Neither the phone in the room, nor the book about the hotel, tells how to call reception. Perhaps most critically, someone left a very important message for me at the desk, and no one recorded it, nor turned on the indicator light on my phone. I was just extremely lucky that the original sender persevered.

It's a lovely hotel overall, but the standards aren't quite up to its appearance.",4,2011,11,15
248,"Great hotel, great location - just a great experience","We stayed at this hotel for two nights as we were going to a gig and wanted to get in some shopping and some chill time too. We got a twin room for a great price for the two nights. 
Check-in and out was perfect, not too long to wait which is always good. 
The hotel had a nice wee car park that it was free for us to use, which is always good, especially with Dublin parking prices :D
The room was lovely and clean, well laid out - nice size. The beds were a lovely size considering it was a twin room. There was a nice welcome pack with tea/coffee etc. There aren't many power outlets in the room which isn't a massive deal but when it came to getting ready and getting phones charged etc there was a bit of a queue. 
Apart from that everything was great, shower was nice and powerful and stayed hot. Bathroom was perfectly roomy for us to get ready to paint the town red and I would definitely put this on the shortlist of one of the nicest places I've stayed.
Definitely worth the visit.",4,2011,11,15
248,Very convenient location,"Just back home from 3 night stay in Camden Court Hotel 4th visit First review. Check in was quick and efficient. Note you have to ask for wifi password and enter it each time. They change it every so often I understand. Wifi was fast throughout the hotel. Had a double room on 4th floor 440. Next time would ask to be further away from the lift but wasn't noisy by any means.
Was on a room only option so didn't try breakfast buffet which was 13euro per person. Went to Yum Yums twice on Camden street which I found very good. As regards dining options around the hotel I would recommend Green19, again, on Camden Street. Housekeeping was very efficient. In fact I left about 5euro in change on the desk for the cleaner the first day as a tip but they never took it so left a tenner at the end of my stay.
Fans of American Football note that the Portobello pub up the road will show the Sky Sports games on the Sunday or Thursday nights. As regards TV in teh room I found it odd that they had Sky Sports 3 but not 1,2 or 4 and they didn't have ch4 either.
I'll stay here the next time i have cause to come to Dublin",4,2011,11,14
248,A great staff at the Camden Court Hotel - would definately recommend!,"Good value, clean hotel and short walking distance to Temple Bar area.  Staff very polite. Hotel food, both in the bar and restaurant - very good and great value.  Breakfast superb!",5,2011,11,14
248,"Nice hotel, nice staff ,slightly away from the city centre","I stayed for the weekend in this hotel in november 2011 and was quite happy overall. The room was clean and comfortable and the breakfast was very nice. We had soup in the central bar which was not very nice at all but as soon as the barman noticed we had not eaten it he refunded us our money. We thought this was very good service as we hadnt even complained. The lobby of the hotel is lovely, they had it decorated beautifully for christmas. When i requested a late check out they gave us an extra hour free of charge. The only thing i would say to anyone thinking of staying here is that it is slightly out of the way. It is a long enough walk to temple bar and dublin city center. Not too far in a taxi but if you're watching your money it could get expensive. I would reccommend this hotel.",4,2011,11,13
248,3 Day Mini Break,"Stayed here for 3 nights B&B.  Breakfasts were excellent with lots of healthy choices.  Rooms spacious, companions had a triple room with 3 large beds, myself and daughter shared a twin room which was very comfortable.  Wide screen tv with good variety of channels to suit all tastes.  Had dinner one night in the hotel, excellent value for money and food was well presented and tasty.
Staff were very helpful in the dining room and reception.",5,2011,11,13
248,Consistently Good,"I regularly visit Dublin on business and while I try different hotels, I keep coming back to the Camden Court because of the Swimming Pool, Gym and the fastest Check Out process of any hotel!  This area of Dublin has a lot of restuarants but I would recommend the bar food menu.  Staff are local and very friendly.",5,2011,11,10
248,Near Crawdaddy,"We picked this hotel due to its location as we were going to a concert in Crawdaddy in Dublin. Its less than five minutes walk to the venue. The staff are friendly and helpful.The room was spacious and very clean. We had an evening meal in the restaurant which was well presented and tasted very good and wasn't expensive. Full breakfast was included and as the hot food is served to you from the counters its means that everything isn't a mess from people helping themselves. With the waiters in attendance at the counters, the food is continously stocked up. I think this is a great way of doing it.",5,2011,11,10
248,Great location good hotel,"Stayed in the Camden Court last Friday night. The location is great near enough to the centre of Dublin that you can walk in an easy 10 minutes but not in the noisy heart of the city. I found the rooms a decent size, the bed was massive, the only slight drawback was the heating. It was a bit noisy but incredibly warm, though there was a thermostat to turn it down. Easy to drive to and with free parking. Would definitely stay there again.",4,2011,11,09
248,Fabulous!,"I stay with the Camden at least once every week as I work in Dublin a lot. It is easily my favourite hotel in Ireland, mainly due to the amazing customer service I recieve every time I'm there. Granted the rooms are a little outdated, but are being renovated regularly. Food is super, both for breakfast and dinner, and room service is always good too. Special mention must go to Christian who works on reception. Each time I arrive, he greets me in a friendly way that makes me feel like he is genuinely happy to see me. It is this time of service that will make sure the Camden keeps the business of myself and my colleagues!",5,2011,11,08
248,Shabby rooms,"The negatives:
 Bedroom could only be described as horrible. The bathroom stank of urine. The decor was very old fashioned. The net curtain was covered in holes. The bed was uncomfortable. The room was overheated and sweltering hot - there was no thermostat on radiator, no way of controlling the temperature other than to open the window, which meant hearing a lot of noise from outside. The receptionists and waiting staff were not overly friendly or informative

The positives:
Breakfast was excellent. The hotel was clean. The cleaning staff were all very friendly. The hotel is well located close to all restaurants, shops and transport links.

All I would say is if you are staying at this hotel do try to ensure that you get one of the newly refurbished rooms(think these are the street facing family rooms?) and not one of the awful older style (double) rooms like the one we stayed in on 5th floor!",2,2011,11,07
248,Close to centre of Dublin..but not too close !!,"Clean and friendly hotel close to centre of Dublin, within walking distance of Grafton Street and main shopping areas. Rooms very clean and upto date.
Friendly staff always willing to give advice on places to visit and what to avoid.
Will definately stay again.",5,2011,11,06
248,Our favourite Dublin Hotel,"Well we've just returned from our 3rd stay at Camden Court & I can honestly say I'm looking forward to our next stay! Its a 3 star hotel but we have definitely stayed in 4 star hotels that are not up to this standard. Rooms are fab, breakfast is fab - great selection & fresh! Had dinner in the hotel 1 night & it was lovely & great value. If you've a car - you'll be delighted to see that there is secure free parking - which is impossible to get in Dublin - it's a huge plus & even for that alone I would stay here again! St Stephens Green is a 5 min stroll away & there are plenty of restaurants, pubs & shops in the area. (Luas stop also behind hotel) Seriously - can not fault this hotel - Should definitely be a 4 Star 
PS: Staff were lovely as always & don't forget to avail of the brill leisure center",5,2011,11,06
248,One of our Favourites!,"My partner and I go away for at least one weekend every month. Even though we mostly stay in 4 stars hotels, this is by far our favourite! We probably go about 8 times a year. Every thing about it is great - I love the leisure centre, the staff are unfailingly nice and friendly and its so nice and cosy. It's close to everything - St. Stephen's Green, Grafton St., The Olympia, The Gaiety Theatre. And the breakfast is superb!",5,2011,11,04
248,Business Hotel Of Choice,"I travel extensively around the country with my job and The Camden Court Hotel is my number one business hotel of choice in Dublin. The reception staff are excellent and make great efforts to build relations over time and make the hotel feel like home away from home. When checking in, the staff recognise you and don't repeat the same spiel that you hear time and time again when repeat checking in to hotels. The hotel has a gym and pool which are difficult to find in City Centre hotel - so no excuses for not exercising while away on business. They is ample parking which is free to guests and their Premium Points System allows you to build up points which offers you the chance to stay free of charge when on a pleasure weekend. It's ideally situated for business and pleasure alike..........only a short walk from the bustling night life while at the same time offering a peacefil nights sleep.",5,2011,11,03
248,Decent hotel stay,"I have stayed in this hotel 3 times now. It is a decent hotel with a very reasonable prices. The rooms are spotless, check in / check out is very effecient. The price of the drink in the hotel bar is expensive enough, so i recommend heading next door to the Bleeding horse pub instead. Apart from that very good experience",4,2011,11,03
248,wonderful stay,"we spend 3 nights at the camden court and it was great, friendly staff, clean rooms, walking distance to lots of the sights. pool and hot tub very nice, pub was excellent... highly recommended",4,2011,11,01
248,OK,"It's an OK hotel... It's right on a busy junction so it is noisy through the night. Some of the staff are happy and helpful others are more surly! The leisure centre has good facilities but it's a bit shabby and needs a bit of a clean.

It's only a 10 minute walk from Grafton street and a 2 minute walk to the LUAS. 

All in all like I said It's OK...",3,2011,10,31
248,Best value in central Dublin,"I stayed here for one night (having stayed here previously). Got a really good rate for a double room and was given an enormous room on the fifth floor. It actually had a double bed plus two singles. I was travelling alone! 

The leisure centre here is excellent with a great pool. There aren't may hotels in central Dublin with a swimming pool. There is, of course, the Shelbourne which will cost you at least twice as much to stay there. But it's only a ten minute walk away if you want to hang out in the famous Horseshoe bar. 

The breakfast was very good - plenty of choice of hot food. In all a great stay.",4,2011,10,31
248,RICHARDSON 14TH/15TH OCTOBER 2011,"Stayed for a couple of nights as part of my 40th Birthday trip to Dublin. Hotel was great, staff very welcoming, nice clean modern room, fairly quiet and had two good nights sleep. Health Club was great. Best thing was the Breakfast so make sure you get a deal with breakfast included as it was unbelievable. Ate so much we didn't need any lunch on both days. Fantastic. Hotel was a 10 minute walk from Grafton Street which is really nice with great shops. Turn left or right as you walk down Grafton Street and you will find loads of great bars and restaurants. Did not rate the Temple Bar area at all. Get the 16a Bus from the airport and save a fortune and it stops at the door of the Hotel. Saving up to go back. Very very good and recommended. If it was poor i would say.",4,2011,10,31
248,Fantastic value destination,"Clean well-serviced room, pool, gym, bar and restuarant two blocks from St Stephan's Green AND moderately priced--who could ask for more!",5,2011,10,31
248,Great Value for Money,"This is the 3rd time Ive stayed in the Camden Court I have never been disappointed.

The hotel is clean, well furnished and the management keep the hotel running like clockwork.  From arrival at reception through to check out staff were always professional and  friendly.  The hotel was busy but not over crowded, so there was a bit of buzz about the place

The gym/pool is small but again spotless and well managed

I didnt eat in the hotel this time but spoke to other guests and they though the service and food was very good.  

The hotel is located a 10 minute walk from St Stephen Green area - and dont be put off by less than senic surrounds of the hotel, its a good venue for a city centre break in dublin and value for money",5,2011,10,29
248,Frowned Upon,"As a young couple from the minute we walked into the hotel we seemed frowned upon. The first reaction at the reception while checking in made us feel uncomfortable. That night we arrived we decided to go for dinner in the hotel restaurant as we were late arriving. The restaurant wasn't that busy but still we were shoved in a corner and the waiter didn't want to give us the time of day. We were given a table with nothing on it and a menu with very little variety. After ordering 2 ladies sat down next to us, the table fully furnished even with complimentary bread and cutlery set out for them whereas we got the cutlery put in a heap to sort for ourselves. The waiter was completely rude and ignorant. When we asked for a side his reaction was ""mm i suppose"" and threw his eye to heaven. We couldn't wait to get out of there to be ourselves and comfortable again. I wouldn't recommend this to young couples looking for a getaway.",2,2011,10,28
248,Wasn't impressed at all....,"Booked here as taught it would be nicely located and would be a treat for my Wife and I to relax the next morning and use the leisure facilities. We were going to a show in the O2 the evening we arrived to see Lee Evans. Check in was great lovely staff. Room very standard. Not very often can get away on night from the kids, we were so looking forward to a lie in, breakfast and use the swimming pool and that. Not to be so nice as turned out. Had the lie in till about 9:30am know it still seem early but when you got kids that is a lie in :-) anyway went to use swimming pool, EE was nice, explained ladies changing room out of order so Wife would have use toilets or if swim suit on use outside at pool??? Men changing area needs good cleaning. Anyway we went to use pool and by God was it FREEZING...Went as far as the waist and I was turning blue from the cold water, Wife was same so gave up and went to use the Jacuzzi, lovely and warm, toasty, but it did not work ??? sat there few min enjoyed the heat after the COLD pool. Wife gave up had to DRY and dress at side of pool and go back to room to shower and change. I taught I'd use the steam room/sauna, Steam room nice and steamy and warm but certainly not clean so tried the Sauna, was cold on entering so through on some water taught great just nice, sat down, and the room was cold within a minute and yes the door was closed before anyone ask. Gave up went for shower not the cleanest changing room might add. So very not impressed as leisure facilities was one of main reasons I booked here. We were going to have breakie here but at the price of breakie we checked out and went else where to have it. Room 501 stayed 26/10/11",2,2011,10,27
248,Nice hotel,Camden Court Hotel is a very nice hotel.  The ambiance was quite nice and the price on the hotel was decent.  It is a little bit of a walk to some of the main tourist attractions.  However it's right by public transportation and you can hop on a bus right outside the hotel.  I traveled with my elderly mother.  We shared a room with a double bed and a single bed.  The room was quite spacious.  A few comments on areas for improvement -- I was a little surprised there were no face clothes with the towels and my mattress was quite hard.,4,2011,10,26
248,Fun Time in Dublin,This was a great value and we enjoyed the convenient location. Pics were very colorful on website but room turned out to be very minimal and void of color. Staff was helpful and lobby was comfortable for hanging out after hours.,3,2011,10,25
248,Good hotel with nice swimming pool,Just returned from a 3 night stay at the Camden Court hotel.  I travelled with my son and family.   We found it to be quite central only a 10 min walk from Grafton Street.   Bedrooms were quite spacious with good central heating. The swimming pool was great and opened at 0800 hrs on Sat and Sun so the kids had a swim before breakfast.  Had a meal in the   restaurant on Sat night and found the food and service to be excellent.  The only downside was the street noise on Fri and Sat nights coming from the pub at the front of the hotel.  Staff were friendly and helpful in giving directions.  I would return to this hotel as the staff made us feel welcome and were very friendly.,4,2011,10,25
248,Great Hotel,"I have been making regular trips over to Dublin every couple of weeks for business since April 2011, and have stayed at the Camden Court everytime. I have always found the staff to be really polite and helpful. On several occasions I have had to request an iron to be sent up to my room, and within 5 minutes someone from house-keeping is there. I tend to have food from the bar (that way I can watch the football), but on the one occasion where I have been in the restaurant the food was excellent. The rooms are comfortable and clean. The location is great, as its only a 5-10 walk to the main shopping streets. Never had a bad experience and would reccomend to anyone.",5,2011,10,24
248,Great location,near St Stephens Green;Grafton Street;Luan and HoHo stop.  Dining room very efficient;good choices.,4,2011,10,17
248,Central hotel with parking & leisure centre/spa,"I have just stayed in this hotel for the second time and I would happily stay again and recommend it to a friend - this time was a business trip, the first time was a shopping trip.  I would recommend it because it is central and easy to find by car, parking is free up to 1pm the following day (after that there's an hourly charge), it is more or less a block from Grafton St, the main shopping street & the Luas line out to Dundrum shopping centre departs from nearby at Stephen's Green (just turn right at the front door of the hotel and left at the next junction, then walk straight for 5mins) - both times the room I stayed in faced the inner courtyard where the cars are parked, so it was really quiet, the bed is comfy and cosy, the shower is good, there's free Wi-fi and the breakfast offers a good variety. We actually had good coffee with breakfast! It's also great to have the option of the leisure centre / spa - on the shopping trip with my daughter, this was a lovely dimension in the evening time. On the business trip the leisure centre was a refreshing start to the day.  The first time I stayed there we ate in the hotel restaurant and both had the fish - we were pleasantly surprised at the quality and we overheard another customer complimenting the ribeye steak.  The staff in reception /restaurant /leisure centre are lovely too. There's a good pub right next door and the famous Whelan's music venue is down the road.  The room we stayed in this time was really nicely decorated, the finish was much nicer than the room I stayed in a few months ago, so maybe they recently re-decorated. It's a bonus having a nicely decorated room, but that's only a detail when the hotel has so much going for it.",4,2011,10,16
248,Extremely Noisy,"In many respects, I do not recall ever staying at a worse hotel. My room was on the second floor facing out to Camden Street. The street noise of people and cars was so loud I could not get to sleep until around 4 A.M. The smell of mold coming from the sink drain made me gag when brushing my teeth. Kind of weird, the pipes vibrate when you turn on the sink. Also, the hotel location is a fairly long walk from city centre.

On the plus side, the front desk staff was reasonably helpful, and the Bleeding Horse Pub is right next door. Drink a lot here and you might be able to get some sleep!",1,2011,10,15
248,Fab Hotel - Great Price and Location,"We stayed here back in February 2011 and could'nt fault it for the price.On a 4 day break 2 adults and 2 children - We had a huge family room which was clean and tidy, comfortable beds,warm and welcoming - spotless bathroom facilities. Staff were very friendly. We made use of the pool,jacuzzi and steam rooms at the end of a days sight seeing and found the hotel location perfect - a 10 minute walk to Grafton St so away from the noise, but not far to walk anywhere. I thoroughly recommend this hotel to any family looking for a nice hotel with good facilities at a fair price - believe me I checked with similar in the areas close to town and most wanted us to have separate rooms (twice the price) - Also recommend the open bus tour gets you around all the sights Guiness/Kilmainham etc very good value for money.",5,2011,10,12
248,Great facilities,"Room was good, bars were friendly restaurant excellent

Easy walk to all parts of Dublin without being in the midst of Temple Bar",4,2011,10,07
248,Quiet location rather close to city center,"I stayed 3 days in late september on this hotel. The hotel i a bit drawn back from the road, wich makes it quiet and nice. Room was quite big and so was bathroom. Breakfast was rather good, and the staff was very friendly indeed. 
We had a meeting at the hotel as well, and the meeting facilities were quite good even though there was some minor problems with the projector and light, but it was imidieately solved by the staff. 
Only minor complaint was, that the reception was short electronic adapters, wich was a bit irritating, but otherwise all was fine. There was app 1 - 1½ km to inner city center. Hotel can definately be recommended but next time I will choose one in the middle of the city center.",4,2011,10,03
248,not bad,"I stayed in this hotel for three weeks. It is nice. every thing was ok taking in consideration that it is a three star hotel. Two notes only:

1. The swimming pool is small
2. The breakfast buffet does not serve a wide variety of dishes",3,2011,09,28
248,"great pool and jacuzzie,","stayed at hotel for one night, great pool and jacuzie, steam room and sauna, no plunge pool. Excellant meal in restaurant great menu, one awfull draw back the music in the dinning room was horrendous bad jazz music, asked if something else could be put on it was replaced by a very downbeat classical.  I like most music, but this was very off putting,  was also visibly disabled yet no help was offered when I struggled with my bags on arrival, even though the hotel was fairly quiet.  I would go back their for the pool etc, but would avoid the restaurant restaurant because of the music.The jaccuzie was the most powerfull one i have been in, just brilliant.",3,2011,09,26
248,Pleasantly suprised,"We stayed in the Camden Court hotel for the Arthurs Day celebrations. I had been looking for a cheap and cheerful hotel to stay in rather than going home. When I checked out the Camden Court hotels website, i think it was roughly about 130-150 for the room only. This was not cheap and cheerful!!! I then saw it on the lidilbreaks.ie website for €79 per couple bed and breakfast, so we booked it. 

Having read a number of the reivews about the hotel, I knew to make sure and request a non-smoking room in the refurbished part of the hotel.

The reception is lovely and airy and gives a wonderful impression of the accomodation. The restraunt and bar area is equally as lovely. We arrived and had a quick lunch. I had a sandwich and was very happy with the freshness of the ingredients and the service from the staff. 

Having only paid €79 for the room, I have to admit, I wasn't expecting a whole lot and as long as it was clean, I was going to be happy enough. Therefore, when we entered the room I was extremely pleasantly suprised. It was a huge room and had 2 double beds and a single bed in it. The bathroom was nice, although the shower wasn't very powerful. It was clean and fully stocked with the usual items such as showercaps etc.

The room was bright and airy. It is one of the first hotels I have ever stayed in that I haven't had to run from mirror to mirror trying to find decent light to put on some makeup!! 

We went for a drink and some dinnner in the bleeding horse pub right next to it. The food in here was lovely and very reasonable. Good hearty pub grub!

Breakfast the next morning was lovely. I know that there have been a number of complaints about the breakfast. I don't know whether I am particularly un-fussy, or the hotel has changed its 'ways' but I enjoyed the selection. There was the option of cereal, crossiants, brown breads, fruit and the usual cooked breakfast. We were both very happy with it. 

It is a fantastic location with all the pubs, restraunts and clubs of Camden Street and Harcourt street located close by. It is perfectly located near Stephens Green, even if there is a little bit of a walk to it. 

The hotel staff were all very friendly and helpful. Checking in and out was a speedy and efficient experience. 

All in all, I would recommend staying in this hotel if you get it for the price I got it. I wouldn't be paying the hotel's rate for the room. While its nice and comfortable, for that price I would be expecting a lot more.",4,2011,09,26
248,Lovly relaxing homely hotel,I stayed at this hotel a few weeks ago with my husband we always travel to Dublin so I have stayed at quite a lot of hotels there this one has to be my favourite food lovly spa to die for and staff exelent if yor thinking of having a nice weekend I. Dublin this is the place to stay every were is quite central u won't be dissopinted,5,2011,09,23
248,A good hotel near the centre & free parking,"Stayed over the weekend. The hotel is located within a 10 minute walk of the city centre. The staff were very friendly and helpful. The room was fairly modern. Did not any problems with noise at night, just the normal noise of people arriving home late.",4,2011,09,20
248,Good for weekend away,"Stayed here in December 2010 with 6 friends on a triple birthday weekend in Dublin booking four rooms between us.

Location wise, it is ok for nightlife.  It is away from the Temple bar area of Dublin which is the classic tourist hotspot to arrive in, fairly far from Guiness factory (both are cab rides or 30 minute walks) but on it's doorstep of the Grapton street area which has one of the better nightlife areas in Dublin.  Within five minutes walk, there are loads of bars including Copper Face Jacks which was a blast.

Across the road from the hotel is one of the best kebab shops for a late night snack.

Hotel wise, clean and functional, showers worked, beds soft enough.  Good for boozy weekend.",4,2011,09,14
248,good value,"this hotel is in the centre of the city within walking distance of everything including good restaurants and sightseeing it has a great swimming pool and good staff, it also has good food  everything you would need for a visit to dublin",5,2011,09,14
248,Average hotel for an expensive city,"Hotel is good value for money, Walking distance to the city centre. The hop on and off bus is a good way of getting around Dublin. 

The hotel itself is very dated needs a refurb. We stayed for a weekend therefore didn't spend a lot of time in the hotel. It's ideal if you're going to be out and about. ",3,2011,09,14
248,NIce downstair but average rooms,"I stayed here because a training course was to be delivered onsite and a corporate rate of €85 Euro B & B was given. This in my view is the right price for a hotel with excellent amenities eg gym, swimming pool, and lovely food and polite staff. If I was the manager and had some capital to invest I think I would spend it on giving the rooms a more modern make over. All in all, would I stay here again...yes, but I would probably prefer it if it had a more luxurious room. Only other remark for improvement is that there seems to always be only one chef ""out front"" no matter how busy it gets... maybe its just me?
There is a great gentlemans barber next door and a nice pub if you fancy killing some time!",3,2011,09,12
248,"great hotel, great location","I had the pleasure of staying in the Camden Court Hotel recently and yet again the service, location and staff were outstanding.  This is a great base for anyone travelling to Dublin.  It is central and has parking.  For a city centre hotel it has the bonus of a small but very functionally leisure centre and underground parking. The room booked was a twin room and to our surprise was exceptionally big and had three double beds.  great hotel and great value",5,2011,09,12
248,"Nice hotel, location a bit outside of things","Our room was comfortable and clean. The hotel is very nice and the swimming pool, jacuzzi etc. are great. Location wise its a bit out of what seem to be the main attractions and places to go but transport is reasonable around it. Staff were fine, no problems with them.",4,2011,09,12
248,I'm glad we changed hotels to this one!,"After reading horrendous reviews of the original hotel we were booked into, we decided at the last minute to book the Camden Court, as the reviews were very favourable. I visited this hotel with my mother, aunt and sister for my sisters 40th birthday weekend.

First off I should add that everyone has their own standards. I like to think mine are pretty high and I'm pleased to say I wasn't at all disappointed by my last minute change.

On arrival at the hotel, we found two workmen painting the front doors (a good sign I think and one that shows due diligence and care for the premises)

We were early arriving so decided to wait in the lobby with a coffee and scone. It was brought over by a very friendly and welcoming lady and the presentation was lovely, nice little touch of shaken chocolate garnishing the plate.

My Aunt, who was travelling from elsewhere in Ireland, arrived and after a pleasant chat with the manager, we were told that one but not both of our rooms were ready. We had asked for, and were given refurbished rooms and as we entered ours (room 333 overlooking the inner courtyard, and by far the quietest side of the hotel), found it to be very clean, pleasant and beautifully decorated. There was a small hitch whereby we were told on check in that breakfast was included and that we should present our room cards at the restaurant in the morning. This was a very pleasant surprise we thought, since we had booked the room only rate.

A little while later we checked to see if our other room was ready, it was and again were told that breakfast WAS included. 

Next morning, we duly presented ourselves at breakfast to be told it WASN'T included as we had booked the room only rate (we confirmed that we knew this but had been told breakfast was included) 

Long story short, everything was sorted out very professionally and in a very friendly manner, this small hitch did nothing to spoil our enjoyment of the hotel or of its staff, who I must add, are extremely professional and courteous, nothing was done or said without a smile.

We partook of the leisure facilities and enjoyed a swim, sauna, jacuzzi and steam room. The leisure centre staff were again very friendly and welcoming and we enjoyed our relax immensely.

The bar staff were lovely, even helping to organise a bottle of bubbly for our celebrations on our first night and on Saturday afternoon, we went in for a snack. A very pleasant young lady served our sandwiches and drinks, again with the ever present smile and professional courtesy.

Check out went smoothly, and we were able to store our bags in a locked room until we were ready to come back later in the day to collect them as we weren't flying out until late Sunday night and decided to take in one last day of enjoying Dublin.

I've stayed in a few hotels in Dublin over the years and would consider this one to be very much the best value for the money we paid. The facilities were clean, the rooms very nicely appointed, the staff warm, welcoming and professional.

I would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone staying in Dublin, a short but very pleasant walk up Harcourt street to the Grafton Street area, if you're coming in on the 747 Airport bus, get off at Trinity College stop and walk up Grafton Street, on to Harcourt Street and turn right at the end of that street, where you'll see the Bleeding Horse pub (the hotel is just next door)

I'll stay here again....and again.",4,2011,09,12
248,If you want a night's sleep don't stay here,"Just returned from a brief pleasure trip to Dublin and stayed for one night in this hotel.  

Yes, the staff were courteous, yes the hotel was clean and basic.  However, room 227 is located by the Bleeding Horse Public House from which loud music eminated until 2 a.m.  I asked reception for a change of room but was advised they were completely full and couldn't offer anything else.  I asked how they expected anyone to sleep in this room to which she replied ""Oh, some people do""!.

Eventually slept, after the music stopped but the next day was somewhat spoilt  as I didn't have the energy to see a lot of the sights I had intended.

Whilst there were coffee/tea making facilities in the room there was no socket for the kettle which had to be placed on the floor where I was able to unplug a standard lamp.",3,2011,09,10
248,Ask if in doubt,"Arrived early, but they still managed to give us a family room, with two separate beds. Unfortunately, it was facing the road/South Camden, and it was noisy in the afternoon and into the early am. We requested another room the next morning, and were given another one facing away, and there were no noise problem thereafter. So, pick the right room.
Hotel was clean and TV channels were reasonable. Staff was friendly and we even got milk for the baby on the hotel once. My wife liked the indoor pool, about 50' long. Lots of cafe and restaurant nearby. I especially liked the Bleeding Horse for dinner and the NY cafe for breakfast. Both less than 10 steps away from the front entrance. The are two computers in the lobby, with slots for coins. Bathroom clean, but some cracks here and there, and the toilet paper is rough. Might need to buy your own. No a/c, but it was cold enough not to need one and the window opens a bit for ventilation. Area is more a local place, with local shops. Walk to Trinity about 15 mins or 8 euro cab fare. Bring umbrella, for the daily rain.",3,2011,09,07
248,Average,"We stayed in this hotel for a weekend in Dublin in order to attend a concert. It was a last minute booking, and we decided on Camden Court due to its free car park.
Rooms were fine, although nothing special. 
The bar was quite expensive even for Dublin city, and we didn't bother trying the restaurant as there was so much choice near the hotel.
I would return to the Camden Court, however it would probably not be my first choice for accomodation in Dublin city.",3,2011,09,07
248,"AVOID, AVOID, AVOID","My family and I were up for a recent sporting occassion and had booked Two rooms.
Having previously stayed here I was expecting much the same from this hotel, However I was sadly mistaken as it has turned into a money grabbing excuse for an Hotel. We ordered Room service which was quite expensive but we had little choice as we were nursing a sick child. They charged €2.75 per item to deliver not €2.75 in total. As well as that the 'Deliverer' was most rude in his level of service demanding the money even before the paltry offering was seen. To say the food was insufficent would be a gross exaggeration. After this a member of our partry (travelling alone) asked for our rooms and was promptly SOLD another one. This individual did not quite understand that the rooms were paid for already and was 'caught on the hop' so to speak. A simple phone call from Reception would have cleared this query up with ease as our Mobiles were inoperable at that time. Later When I went down to clear up the issue I was dealt with by a most understanding receptionist who wiped the transaction clean. Lets hope the CC does not show up an entry of € 95 in it's next statement. However the way I was treated so well by the receptionist made me wonder is this a common occurence where the hotel rent out vacant rooms to unsuspecting patrons - perhaps with one too many on them. 
So to all ye contemplating still going, here are some suggestions:
1. No CC transactions with this hotel
2. Avoid Room service
3. If Tipsy be very carefull as overcharging/overcharging is ripe",1,2011,09,06
248,"Clean hotel, terrible location","We stayed at the Camden court hotel in september. The hotel is located south of the river Liffey and is quite a ways from the temple bar area, which is where all the good pubs and restaurants are located. We had room 207 which was in facing the street. Until 4 am there was souch noise from the street (people yelling, the sound of broken glass, trucks passing) and the windows don't block much of it. If you're going to be in Dublin I don't recommend this hotel as it's about a 25 min walk to temple bar area and all the other main attractions. The hotel was clean and the staff was very friendly, nothing negative to say there. ",3,2011,09,05
248,DEPRESSING TO SAY THE LEAST,"stayed here after being recommended by hotel rooms.com  between them they spelt my Name wrong 3 times in the end i gave up .Anyway what a waste of money .
First up was the room , the room was on the fourth floor as the noise was unbearable from the traffic outside & the heat in the room was unbearable ,but due to having to kids with us  the broken saftey catch on the window did not allow us to keep it open .Went to make a cup of tea and to my suprise there was no socket to plug the kettle in anywhere in the bedroom, sorry there was, but as the lead was so small you had to make the tea under the dressing table on the floor!!!!! this was the only socket in this family room  HOW THIS HAS NOT BEEN SPOTTED BEFORE NOW I DONT KNOW  then to my suprise no sugar i gave up in the end maybe thats what they want ??,also they have an ice machine down the hall ,went to get ice from it there was no paper cups or bags to put ice in ,either at the ice machine or in the room. 
Noitced the Pictures on the wall only had half a picture visible  in it & the room itself had no aircon and smelt very stale very annoyed at the quality of the room 
i was wondering are there newly decorated rooms in the hotel as this is not the pictures i seen 
went for breakfast this was okay for the tea and toast, the juice was from a machine which is just cheap rubbish and tastes like  anything other than fruit juice .they had a stwo  of the most boring cereals you could get ( weetabix / rice krispies ) 
the cooked breakfast was probably  the smallest breakfast i have ever had in a hotel stay anywhere  ,i feel like oliver twist ( please sir can i have some more !!!) ALTHOUGH A BUFFET IT FELT LIKE THEY WANTED TO KEEP THE FOOD none of the lids were taken off the hot  food so you could not see what was in the dishes i think they were hiding it ???Although there were small signs above the dishes 
As the breakfast was a buffet you would expect to get some help at breakfast i.e the tea toast ect ...but  everything was d.i.y do it yourself right down to the milk for your tea 
there is a lot to be said about staying in a hotel where breakfast is still served by the staff 
having breakfast here at camden court was just like being in the house if i had wantred to do everything for myself i could have stayed at home ( just a little help guys !!!
maybe milk on the tables / bring tea and coffee at least ......
the health club downstairs the staff were great in here ,I thought  the club was very used and dated  in need of a Makeover
the steam room was full of hair and needed a good clean for a start ....
on the plus side car park was free
to sum up ...Although this hotel is in a great location i think it is over priced the room was only the size of double room and did was nothing to write home about premier inns are far more comfortable ...
the last time we stayed in dublin we stayed at the ashling hotel at phoenix park near the zoo ...you need to sit up and look at the quality in comparison.... perhaps this was why we could not get a room there opn this occasion .
i brought some of my concerns to the hotel reception but i think it fell on deaf ears 
our room number was 400 staying 23rd 24th",2,2011,08,25
248,Wonderful theatre break,Just returned from a theatre break at the Camden Court and can thoroughly recommend this hotel. We had a lovely quiet room and enjoyed a great evening meal before going to the theatre which was only a 10 minute walk away. Breakfast was also very good. We found the staff to be most friendly and helpful. Our stay was most definitely value for money.,5,2011,08,24
248,You want an honest review....you got it read on!!,"This was my first time staying in this hotel, so you don't get a second chance to make a first impression.
Finally arrived at the hotel and got a parking space.  Took luggage and went to reception.  First thing you notice is that it is very clean. Checkin was swift, smooth and efficient (the only thing that I would recommend is that the lady receptionist takes her time explaining where everything is). Our family room is located on the floor floor.  Lifts very clean and fairly quick too. The room  was spacious. Bathroom - neat, clean and tidy and the bedroom the same.  Lights all working, TV working.  NOTE: This hotel provides an excellent rate and you are not going to get the Ritz, but it is very Clean and modern enough.
The bar is modern, alothough I personally did not like layout and it was a bit dark BUT, this bar was always packed. TV's located in all the strategic points. Food was first class. Guinness perfect and Irish Coffee made brilliantly!  The bar staff were friendly and efficient.  Was very impressed by the menu highlighting food suitable for vegetarians, gluten free etc.
The breakfast in the morning was just ok, but it served its purpose.  Lack of variety eg. fresh fruit, different yoghurts etc.  Staff were efficient but not as friendly as the bar.  I noticed no notice displayed stating if you have special dietary requirements contact staff e.g. gluten, nut allergy etc.
My family really enjoyed the pool, sauna etc - no complaints there!
Our room was made up when we requested it.
Checkout was swift and efficient.  FINALLY, This hotel is central!! To shopping,, the luas stop, it offers excellent value, parking is free, there is a swimming pool, bar is great (special mention to the excellent bar staff), clean, tidy.  Some staff are super efficient and some are just ok.. but still provide a great service.  Would I stay here again DEFINITELY!!",5,2011,08,24
248,Good value for money,"We recently stayed at the Camden CRT hotel and found it good value for money. The family room was basic but adequate. I also booked a single room for a family member traveling with us and I asked for a refurbished room-unfortunately this was not arranged as discussed. The location is brilliant-so close to central Dublin. We walked everywhere during our stay. The breakfast is great!. The service isn't fabulous- We didn't find anyone at anytime to be particularly warm or friendly.
I'd have to agree with other reviews that the traffic noise & people on the street can be quite loud during the night.
The pool and gym are great!
 The highlights for us were the location, the breakfast, the gym & pool which we used each day.",4,2011,08,23
248,Very Good Hotel,"My wife, three children and mother-in-law stayed for three nights in clean and comfortable rooms. The shower were great and hot with a good size bath. The beds were extremely comfortable. The rooms we had were looking onto the main road which can be noisy(we unfortunately had night-time roadworks under our windows for a couple of nights), but we weren't expecting cuckoo calls and wind in the trees as we were in a city. One lacking thing in the rooms though was air conditioning, and because the noise outside made it impossible to keep the windows open, the rooms were extremely hot and stuffy. Wouldnt like to be in the rooms during very hot weather(not that we are that blessed here in ireland!!) Not enough to ruin a holiday for us but needs to be looked at. Also, there is no safe in room but hotel do have safe deposit at reception for small items.
We did not eat in the hotel(apart from gougons and chips as a late bite for kids-lovely) as we were out most of the time during the day, but looked at the menus which seemed like standard hotel fayre. The restaurant looked lovely though. The bar and reception area were nice places to relax after a long day out and all the staff were very friendly, except for one young female bar tender who has a lot to learn about manners and how you should act towards paying customers when working in hospitality. The sooner she is trained properly, the better for this hotel. It would be a shame for this fine hotel for one member of staff be responsible for upsetting customers needlessly. 
The pool was lovely and clean, the jacuzzi great and the staff friendly and helpful. The gym looked very good and well equipped.
We had our main meals in Captain Americas, Thunder Road and The Bleeding Horse. Don't go near the Bleeding Horse for food. I will post a seperate review for all these places.
Overall great hotel with great facilites great staff(one exception) and in a pretty good location close by to the centre of Dublin.
Would stay again and recommend.",4,2011,08,19
248,"pretty standard, good location","Stayed here with family of 3 kids for 3 nights.  Family room located on 4th floor.  First thing to note is that our first night was a Saturday and parking was a total nightmare in the underground and above ground car parks.  Luckily this was only an issue on the Saturday night as all other days parking spaces where plentiful.  The hotel room itself could do with a lick of paint and some TLC.  Room was clean so no complaints there, it just was a bit tired looking.  Breakfast was fine if not spectacular and the pool and gym facilities where great for those with kids.  Pretty much a run of the mill 3 star hotel. Free parking and central location very much a plus.",3,2011,08,17
248,Fair price for moderate luxury and ideal location away from the tourist area,"Camden Court Hotel is a great hotel to book for your Dublin visit if you want to be sure to be far enough away from the tourist area (Temple Bar) but still in good walking distance to the central part of Dublin, clubs and pubs. It's much quieter area but since it is right next to The Bleeding Horse (one of my favorite Irish pubs), a few hostel and close walking distance to some major clubs there are nights were it can be a little noisy but no were close to the noise you will find if you stay new Temple Bar. This is also a great hotel to stay for business if you are budget conscious as it is not too expensive and comes equipped with all necessary amenities. The staff was also friendly and had a good sense of humor when I was there. I recommend this hotel and I will be sure to stay there my next visit.",4,2011,08,15
248,good hotel,"This was a nice hotel with a good location in relation to Dublin close to a good tram connection,which takes you into the centre of Dublin.The area arouind the hotel is rather depressing,and we were asked for money and cigarettes several times. Although the main road runs outside there was very little noise at night, in spite of it being bank holiday",4,2011,08,14
248,What a dump. Forget this place,"A depressingly small room with old furniture, spotted carpets and sticky bathroom floors. Their online photos show a nice lobby and beautiful bed but don't buy this promotion. I asked for a wheelchair accessible room and it was the smallest and most depressing room I have ever stayed at. I couldn't even turn around in this old, dreary, non-air conditioned room. The parking facilities were the worst I have ever encountered. Avoid this place at all costs.",1,2011,08,09
248,Loved it - much more than a 3*,"My boyfriend surprised me for my 21st birthday on a city break to this hotel with a deal he found on Travel Zoo. I would definately say its more 4* than a 3*. We had a perfect weekend and the hotel staff were friendly, the rooms were clean and the main parts of the hotel are beautiful. My boyfriend used the free gym, sauna and steam room facilities which was very good. The pool was clean as was the lovely jacuzzi. It was nice and quiet as not in the middle of the city centre but close enough to walk too (less than 10mins). I'd highly recommend the hotel.",5,2011,08,04
248,"Very impressive hotel. Great location, free parking","Recently stayed in this hotel with girlfriend. Perfect for mid week stay for shopping/ clubbing. Close enough to walk to stephens green, far enough out to be quiet enough to get a good nights sleep. Leisure centre an added bonus, very clean and helpful staff. Very satisfactory stay.",4,2011,07,29
248,Great Family Hotel,"The hotel offers free parking and is only 15 mins stroll to stephens green.  The lesiure facilities are great the pool was loved by my 9 yr old and towels were provided as well as floats.  The bar food was great and the childrens menu gave lots of options not just the usual chips and chicken nuggests.  The staff were really friendly and helpful and well presented. Will use this hotel again when in Dublin, it was brilliant",5,2011,07,29
248,Great hotel- close enough to walk to all the action,"Camden court hotel is approx 15-20 mins walk from all the shops and temple bar. Rooms good, some more updated than others. Service very good- all staff very helpful. Leisure centre with pool, gym, sauna and steam room excellent. Breakfast which we had once was very good- excellent choice of hot and cold food and you can eat as much as you want.It may appear expensive but is worth the money.
Not a bad price for Dublin.
Overall we had an excellent stay in Dublin and would recommend this hotel.",4,2011,07,28
248,Recommended but a bit noisy at weekends,"I stayed here for 2 nights.  The hotel was clean and spacious and the bed was very comfy!  There was an extensive choice for breakfast which consisted of a hot and cold buffet - this set me up for the day!  

The hotel is a pleasant 10 minute walk to the City Centre and wasn't far from the Air Coach bus stop.  The only negative point was that there was a lot of noise from a nearby pub.  It was a hot night so we had the window open and I was kept awake by the noise of music and glasses being smashed.  Apart from this, it was a good stay and I would recommend this hotel - ask for a room that doesn't face the street.",4,2011,07,24
248,Fantastic,"I organised a girls night for 15 of us, obviously requiring a certain amount of planning. From the time I first contacted this hotel the staff could not have been more helpful, informative and pleasant. In particular Theresa in reservations went out of her way to accommodate my ever changing requests. The hotel is so well located, really easy to drive to, particularly coming up from the south. The rooms were all spot on, clean and comfortable. The bar staff were also wonderful, arranging tea and sandwiches for us at ridiculously short notice as well as organising our evening champers exactly as I'd requested. 
To sum up all of the girls commented that they would definitely use this hotel again if they were coming to Dublin. It was perfect from start to finish.",5,2011,07,21
248,Highly recommended!!!  Will definately be back :-),"Ideally located hotel for many major tourist attractions, walking distance or a short bus ride to the Spier in the centre of town. Very plush recetion area with comfortable chairs, plenty of them tastefully arranged.  The reception itself was spacious, the staff were very helpful. Check In time was 2pm, we arrived at around 10 a.m. the staff put our luggage into a secure lock-up as our room was not ready.  The room itself was beautifully clean, daily maid service, top up of tea/cofee facilities. Flat screen TV on the wall was a little small, but big enough for our use. We stayed on B & B board basis, the breakfast was excellant, the tables were spaced generously, and staff in there were very cheery. We didn't use the restaurant during the evening, as we were always out and about at meal times.  The bar was very nice, but a little expensive. Lots of small shops and food places close to the hotel, and the bus stop was just across the road.  Excellant restaurant to recommend is the Surma, Indian Restaurant very close to the hotel. I'll be rebooking this hotel for a stay later in the year :-)",5,2011,07,20
248,Very Comfortable,"Stayed here for 2 nights. Large hotel in a good location for Grafton Street shopping, St Stephen's Square, Gaiety Theatre, Guinness Storehouse. Free parking is in underground car park. Staff friendly and helpful. Nearby to several convenience stores, restaurants and pubs so we just left the car and walked. We saw Riverdance at the Gaiety Theatre and just walked the 15 mins to the theatre. 30 mins walk to the Guinness Storehouse (a must do in Dublin!). Room was well equipped and a reasonable size. Free wifi was hit and miss but was usable but quite slow at times. Very clean. Recommended.",5,2011,07,18
248,The whole experience was excellent,"Great location, easily accessible, got a great night's sleep as it was very quiet even on a busy Saturday night. Good value for money, excellent breakfast, very attentive and friendly staff. Room and hotel in general was immaculately clean, generously sized room, made my trip to Dublin very enjoyable! 5 stars!",5,2011,07,16
248,Unfortunately not what it used to be!,"My family & I stayed at this hotel for 2 nights over the 11th & 12th July & having previously stayed at this hotel 6 or 7 times over the past 6 years im sorry to say this will be our last visit. As much as the staff, food & free underground parking where all excellent, the rooms were shabby, old & dirty & very run down. They are in need of some TLC & until this happens i wont be staying at the Camden Court hotel again :-(",3,2011,07,14
248,Back for more..,"This is our second trip to the Camden this year. We were here in January when down for a wedding and really enjoyed our time there. Unfortunately we didn't get a chance to use the spa facilities and decided to come back for another 3 days. One good thing about it is the free underground parking, a great plus in Dublin. The staff are always friendly, polite and courteous. Getting back to the spa, it has everything you need for a relaxing couple of hours and a great place to go after a days sightseeing.
The buffet breakfast is adequate and whilst quality could be better there is ample choice from cooked , cereals and fresh fruit.
Rooms are clean and tidy and maintained throughout the stay. 
Location wise it is in a good spot and within easy walking distance of everything you need.
Would consider it again in the future.",4,2011,07,13
248,OK for a night's accomodation,"I stayed here with my boyfriend for one night. The reception, parking situation and lift were clean and gave a good impression. However, the room was pretty shabby, people had obviously smoked in it and the decor was dated. The bathroom was also in need of a facelift. It was perfectly reasonable accommodation but I wouldn't recommend it for more than a quick stop over.",3,2011,07,12
248,"Location so-so, service fine, some weird concepts","The headline tells the most. The location is in the middle of a diverse and a bit scruffy neighbourhood. I liked it, but I suppose many would be prefer to be more in the centre of town.

I arrived at 11:00 and was very pleased to find that my room was already available. The reception was efficient and kind and even handled a glitch in the reservation (that was not their fault) with ease and care.

Rooms are nice for this price range. I could have avoided the thick carpets for wooded flors, but I suppose it's mostly a question of taste (and how easy it is to clean, but as everything actually seemed clean and neat, that would not be an issue here).

Breakfast is good, although when you run a buffet service, it is weird to have to wait for someone to come over and hand you one tomato, two slices of bacon, one precisely measured scoop of scrambled eggs and four mushrooms on a plate. Couldn't we do that ourselves? In many ways the hotel has such odd concepts, but the staff was kind and friendly in general.

I was in doubt whether to give three or four dots. The deciding point was that the hotel does not provide umbreallas in a climate and weather as Dublin's. That would have been such a nice thing, as you can't expect tourists and other visitors to carry umbrellas with you from home.

And another point: The free wifi was fine, but difficult to use from an iPad and smartphones as you have to log on with a code every single time you want to get online. That could have been done a lot simpler.",3,2011,07,07
248,"Made our stay in Dublin,","We stayed here for the Neil Diamond concert in the Aviva stadium last week and we really and truly enjoyed our two nights at this hotel. We found the staff very friendly and the food really nice and fantastic value for money.

The leisure centre with a huge swimming pool down stairs was an added bonus.

Now I just have to find a reason to return!",5,2011,07,05
248,"Great stay, would stay again.","I had to stay in Dublin for a week for business. I stayed the first two nights in a hotel just outside the city and then found the Camden Court, offering the same rates and right where I needed to be.

Was very pleased with the quality of the hotel, it is not your average 3 star…it definitely gives off a 4 star vibe. My room was great and staff were very helpful and attentive. I ate out most nights but I did try the food in the bar once and it was good. I would recommend this hotel, especially if you want to be right in the city.",5,2011,07,05
248,Love it!,"I have just written my first tripadvisor review and it was a bad one (I wanted to warn people about the particular hotel), So I thought it would be helpful to also share my good experiences. I have stayed at the Camden Court on two occasions. The first was a few years ago with my now husband, the second was last June 2010 with the girls in the family for a shopping weekend. I do not have a single complaint about this hotel, it is first class in my eyes. Food was delishious, rooms were perfect, reception was lovely, staff were friendly, the was was cosy and was in walking distance to the main shops. I would stay here again in a heartbeat.",5,2011,07,04
248,Ok place but not wild about it!,"A good middle of the road hotel.  
Good foyer, mediocre food and breakfast, staff ok.  Rooms are just about ok.
Would not be rushing back unless the price is really keen.
It has an enviable position in central Dublin and has free parking and a leisure centre.",3,2011,06,30
248,Very average hotel with stuffy rooms and basic breakfast!,"I must say that I have mixed feelings about my stay at the Camden Court Hotel. Initial impressions were good - a nice inviting lobby, friendly staff and although we could not check in until 2pm we didn't mind waiting in the lobby and relaxing. Our thoughts upon entering the room were also positive - a bright room with a nice comfortable big bed, tastefully decorated, excellent hairdryer and ironing board and iron. However there was a smell of smoke in the supposedly non-smoking wing of the hotel and there were quite a number of issues with the room. Firstly, there was no net curtain or blind on the window, which looked directly into an office block and therefore we were either forced to close the heavy curtains, left sitting in total darkness and contend with the stuffiness or else have very little privacy with the office workers opposite looking directly into the room. The bathroom was so dark that it was impossible to put on makeup properly. Even while taking a bath, it was difficult to read. The shower was also not very powerful but it was satisfactory and the bathroom was modern and clean. The safe was quite interesting, whereby you had a key to lock it, which meant you were forced to bring the key with you or else hide it in the room - not very practical and most unusual today! The biggest issue I had with the room was the stuffiness. It was not particularly warm in Dublin with average temperatures but the room was so hot at night. There was no air conditioning and the window could only be opened a little. With the curtains pulled, it was unpleasant to sleep there. We only had breakfast once during our stay and I was disappointed. The number of healthy items to eat was limited to a little fruit and yogurt or muesli with the typical Irish breakfast, which was greasy and heavy dominating the breakfast menu. As someone who does not eat meat, my choices were limited to some eggs, hash browns, beans and mushrooms with toast. The chef serving the breakfast was not very generous with the hash browns and when I asked for some more as I only had one on my plate, he would only give me one more. I think a self service system would work more effectively here. We had to wait about 15 minutes before anyone came to ask if we wanted coffee. Again, it would be better if we could serve ourselves. Our experience in the bar was positive and the barman was very friendly. The hotel is also centrally located at the top of Harcourt Street, just a ten minutes walk from Stephens Green. However if I had the choice, I would not stay here again.",2,2011,06,30
248,"Very good hotel, great area, close to everything","I stayed here from June 24th till June 27th with two friends. When we booked there wasn't a room available with three single beds. I contacted the hotel and this was indeed not available (only double and 1 single) However when we arrived the hotel arranged for an extra single bed in the room: I call that the extra effort !
Also the bar is open till late, the swimming pool and gym are fantastic. The area is great for bars, clubs and pubs outside of the temple bar area. City center is very walkable (5-10 minutes down the road)
I would definately recommend this hotel !",5,2011,06,30
248,Very enjoyable stay in good hotel.,"First time to stay at Camden Court and absolutely no complaints.
Checkin staff very efficient and rooms very clean and comfortable. Didn't try any of the food, as good breakfat options in the area, eg Rhubarb Cafe, Yum Yums for lower price. Why hotels charge €13 for breakfast and €10 for lunch beats me.
 Swimming pool and leisure centre a bonus. A comfortable ten minute walk to Stephens Green area.
Looking forward to return visit.",4,2011,06,29
248,Excellent Hotel,"We stayed here recently to attend a concert. We had an excellent stay. The staff were very friendly, welcoming and extremely helpful. 

We stayed in room 512 which was very spacious and spotlessly clean as was the bathroom. The room had everything you could ask for. The bed was comfortable and fresh. 

We had dinner the night we arrived and breakfest the following morning, both were lovely. 

The hotel itself has a lovely atmosphere, very clean inside & out. I would recommand to anyone. ",5,2011,06,28
248,"Poor service, stained rugs, paint peeling from walls, uncomfortable beds","We stayed 2 nights in June and we scheduled to return for 1 night at the end of our vacation before flying out.  The staff was surly, the room shabby and depressing.  There were stains on the carpet and paint peeling from the walls.  The mattress was uncomfortable and bed was very very old (the bed was crooked so I slept at an angle).  We changed our last night to an airport hotel - couldn't stand the thought of coming back to this dump.",1,2011,06,28
248,3rd Time Unlucky,"This is the 3rd time I have stayed at the Camden Court and you think I would have learnt by now.  We were visiting Dublin to Watch Take That as we couldn't get tickets in Manchester.
The room was as expected basic with no fridge or safe.  I can't understand why hotels do not supply a chest of drawers they must think most people are happy to live out of a suitcase.  Had to put folded clothes either in the tiny drawers alongside the hairdryer or on a shelf under the luggage rack.
The bathroom was not much better, the shower was very slow and you had to run round to get wet.  The shower head was constantly on pulse no matter how you turned it and was quite annoying when hitting you in the face.  I mentioned it at the reception and was asked about the water pressure which i didn't realise there was a problem with.  I was told someone would look at it but I don't know wether they did or not and we were only their for 2 nights so I couldn't be bothered checking.  I have to say that I have never seen frayed bath towels in a hotel before but I have now.  They looked like something you would find in a no star hotel I couldn't believe my eyes.  If I had towels like that at home I would sling them, they looked like something you would use to wash the dog with.

Be warned if you fancy a swim in the pool you have to wear a hat and if you don't have one you must buy one.

We visited the bar, which has been changed since my last visit and is a bistro.  It cost almost €10 for 2 drinks so we bought some wine from the local tesco down the road.

The breakfast is ok, I only had cereal and toast on the first day and there was very little choice of cereal.  I had a cooked breakfast the 2nd day but as I don't eat meat I just had scrambled egg, hash browns beans and mushrooms.  Most of it was overcooked and I ended up eating just the beans and some egg with lots of tomato sauce on.  The coffee was rather nice though and in a pot.  However the staff were not very helpful, they just walk around with coffee and tea on a tray and pass it out as required, my husband waited 10 minutes before he got any.

I understand that some people are happy with this hotel however I have stayed in far nicer hotel at far cheaper cost.  I think Dublin on the whole is very expensive even if it is relatively cheap to get there.

I am sure this isn't the worst hotel in Dublin but I certainly wouldn't stay there again.  I have to say that the distance from the city is not a problem as it is only about 10 minutes walk to St Stephens Green Shopping Centre and Grafton Street",3,2011,06,27
248,Excellent hotel and staff. Highly recommend,"On reading the mixed reviews on trip advisor we weren't sure about booking this hotel, however with the rake that concert on Dublin was pretty full so took the gamble. The reception staff were excellent. Could not have been more helpful. Room was just as u see in the photos. Very nice indeed and the breakfast was fantastic. Nice and fresh. Highly recommend.",5,2011,06,27
248,dirty.reception area would fool you into thinking its got nice rooms!,"dusty dirty shower did not work unhelpful didnt fix shower or clean room after being asked twice.didnt move us to another room. rude. crappy rooms regardless of dirt, tiny.breakfast edible but nothing you would be trying to get up for. really unpleasant stay. and dublin is a great city break. such a shame. the shops are FAB. on the plus side it was one of the only hotels close in to the city - only 15 min walk - that had parking. wasnt particularly cheap either. great bus service in dublin, next time will just stay a little further out and get somewhere cheaper with parking and nicer!",1,2011,06,26
248,Pleasant stay,"The weather was on the cool side and the heat had been turned off, but they gave me a portable heater which took the chill off.  One thing that surprised me was that my room had no real drawer space.  Just two shallow drawers in the desk, one of which contained the hair dryer, and one in each night stand.  I had to move the tea tray from its stand in the closet to make room for shirts.  Unlike some other reviewers, I found the bed very comfortable.  
Food at breakfast was good, and it was possible to get eggs cooked to order.  Food in the bar was also good, once you got the attention of someone to take your order.  The hotel bar itself was small, and ordering food and drink in the lobby could take time, since it often got very crowded and noisy.
Internet access was possible at one of two computers in a corner of the lobby for a charge of one euro for 8 minutes; that passed very quickly but you were prompted to add more cash before being cut off.
I found the location good, walking distance to St. Stephens Green and the shops on Grafton Street.",4,2011,06,25
248,Dublin's alright,"I'll do some on the travel, the hotel and the city - I may review Dublin in detail elsewhere on tripadvisor

We stayed 16th to 18th June as we had managed to get cheap flights.
I had read (on tripadvisor and our hotel confirmation) that the 16A goes right to the hotel and had that confirmed by tourist info at the airport. it was €2.90 each for a one way ticket, which is worth it if you're not travel sick like my wife, we got the €7 air coach back.

The hotel is really alright. We were 6th floor which may seem problematic but it wa the only floor that appears to offer views over Dublin (through the air vents and doesn;t sit over the Bleeding horse Pub next door) and the lifts were quick to avoid waiting.
The room (we had 605) was ok. We had coffee and tea facilities, an iron and board and trouser press  all in the room. I used the iron and it didn't knacker anything.
There's a  free electronic safe, flat screen tv with ok pre set channels.
The bathroom was functional but most of all clean. Probably a couple of years away from a refurb...which is better than a couple of days from needing one.
The bed was a little on the soft side and I developed a little bit if a stiff neck.
Worse thign is the thinness of walls. night one we heard an Irish couple arguing...more accurately we heard the women shouting ""don't push me"" right up to the point when her partner pushed her out the room and slammed the door on her...we heard no more after that.
night two we heard a little too much giggling from the room the other way and about 1am I could hear someone knocking on a door trying to wake someone. No external noise to distract, though 6 floors helps, but we were near a busy road junction.
We didn't eat at the hotel - we got breakfast 20 yards round the corner at the Rhubarb €6.95 for full Irish. But the restaurant always looked busy, including evenings, which I think is a good sign. Lots of business people taking advantage of that probably but it looked a nice place. The foyer/lounge area was also always busy...which I find unusual. Free wi fi appeared to assist the laptop generation with that. And there were two PC's for you to take advantage of.
We were going to use the pool which looked nice - WOMEN NEED A SWIM CAP - but bad timing prevented it.
I'll give the hotel an overall it 3.5 out of 5 and I'm taking 0.5 of for location. Although it looks close to the city on the map, and there are hotels a lot further out, it;s JUST that little bit too far to enjoy a walk in and out. We didn;t want to be on Temple Bar or O'Connell street due to the associated nightlife but this was probably JUST that little too far.
It'll never be a 5 out of 5 to be fair, but if I couldn't get the same standard nearer the town, I'd go back",4,2011,06,21
248,Great hotel,"We got this hotel as part of a package to see Take That. To make the most of our break we booked an extra night. We arrived in Dublin very early in the morning so we went to see if we could leave our luggage but luckily our room was ready and the friendly receptionist was happy to book us in straight away.  After a delicious coffee in the tastefully decorated lobby (and a play on the touch screen info gadget gizmo!) we made our way to our twin room. Very basic but had everything we need; bed, TV, kettle, toilet and bath. Spotlessly clean and fresh, the beds seemed hard at first but were really comfortable.  We used the steam room, sauna and Jacuzzi which were great. There are clubs and bars nearby (it is Dublin!) but we weren't affected by any noise. The breakfast was fantastic and really good quality. There seemed to be a problem with the guests who leave it till 5 minutes before the end of service before coming in, getting sniffy about the queue and having to wait all of 4 minutes for a cooked breakfast but you'll get that anywhere. While the chef politely excused himself from serving and quickly got some more eggs on to cook, the ""gentleman"" behind me was asking his wife if 'all of this is entirely necessary'.  The staff coped very well and seemed totally unfazed. 
My only complaint would be the quality of the toilet paper. It was that really cheap feeling recycled stuff where I would have preferred a soft one.  However, when I mentioned this to my husband he said he preferred the hotel’s.  So there you go. No complaints!",4,2011,06,20
248,"Fantastic location, Great Hotel!","If you are looking for a base in Dublin it doesnt get much better than this hotel. The location is tops, staff friendly, Hotel Clean and does a great breakfast. Our stay was great value for money and we will definitely be back for another dublin fix!",5,2011,06,12
248,A great hotel but not very central.,"My partner and I stayed here for a long weekend. We went with friends for a wedding and really enjoyed our stay. The hotel is of a good standard. The room was large, clean and comfortable. The view was of the car park but we didn't mind (we were out and about so much it didn't matter to us). Friends of ours said they were woken by clubbers leaving nearby clubs in the early hours of the morning but we didn't hear this. The staff were friendly and helpful at the reception desk. 

The swimming pool and gym facilities were nice and a bonus. You have to buy a swimming cap but we made enough use of it! We didn't visit the restaurant as there are plenty of places to eat in Dublin. Instead, other reviewers wrote about Yum Yums which is nearby and we went there every morning for breakfast - fabulous! Large portions, variety and good value.

The only negative I suppose would be the walk into the centre of Dublin. It didn't bother us as we wanted a hotel with a car park. We travelled about in the car or by foot (about 20 mins walk into the centre of Dublin).

Overall, we got what we paid for and enjoyed our stay.",4,2011,06,12
248,Very happy with the Camden Court Hotel,"I'm a business and leisure traveller and travel to Dublin about 10 times a year. I have tried many hotels and B&B's but have found the Camden Court to best to stay in while in Dublin. Rooms are always clean, there is a gym, pool and car park. Access to the hotel is easy, there always is parking and you have lots of restaurants and bars closeby. The Luas stops just across the road. I have found the staff pleasant and they always try to help. Surprisingly, the bar food is great, I would recommend the chilli beef dish. If you're looking for a reasonably priced hotel right in the centre of Dublin check out the Camden Court Hotel!",5,2011,06,08
248,The pictures are not reality- this is nothing spectacular,"We spent a few nights here and while it was clean- the beds are like sleeping on a cement slab.  On one night- our nonsmoking wing was filled with so much smoke in the halls ( from what I can only imagine was about  20 people smoking in a room) that it triggered an allergy attack and subsequent migraine- the staff addressed it once- but then it happened again in the middle of the night.  I found the staff to be helpful but so uptight and rigid, there was none of the Irish warmth that I had experienced in other parts of the country.  The area of the hotel is not the best- I did not feel safe at all.  The pool was terrific for the kids.  The breakfast was included but The menu never changed- I would love to have seen real hash browns...French toast or even pancakes..waffles or omlettes would ave been great too...just a little variety. While the lobby was nicely decorated, the rooms looked like a hostel.  A little color and maybe some pictures on the walls.  Overall- I don't think I would stay here again- I would opt for a hotel closer to the action.  Another suggestion would be to have clocks in the rooms",3,2011,06,07
248,Nice but not great,"When we arrived we looked for something resembling the photo on the main hotel web site however the photo they use there is the back - not the front of the hotel - which I think is a little misleading. I assume that a front photograph is not used because then you would see the very large pub based right outside the hotel. We also noticed that the main front door was not open therefore had to access the reception using the rear entrance - we had contacted the hotel the week previously to advise them that our flight was not landing until 10pm therefore I was surprised that when the hotel responded, they did not tell us at that stage that the main door closed and what we should do upon arrival. My partner arrived on a Saturday night after a fairly long journey and were allocated room 226. When we went in, I was surprised to hear noise which as it turned out was because the room we were in was the nearest one to the large  - and very noisy - pub downstairs. Even with the windows closed,the noise was constant and not just background. It was a typical Saturday night with loud music and as there is also a beer garden, lots of loud voices which is fine if (a) you want to be part of that or (b) if the staff were to advise you but of course they didn't. We checked when the pub was closing which was 2.30am :( We went directly to reception and requested a different room - the first time we have ever had to do this - and were told that the hotel was fully booked but we could be offered a different room the next day. The staff were pleasant however the younger gentleman on reception did not seem surprised when we requested a different room and I think that with this particular room, it had happened in the past. On another small note, whilst waiting for the pub to close and the music to stop, we couldn't even have a cup of tea as there was no milk !

We were moved the next day to a room at the rear of the hotel which was much better. We also had the breakfast which was good but fairly standard of a hotel breakfast and small changes could make a difference such as a covered container for the bread / croissants - bread starting to curl up at the sides really isn't too appetising.

Overall, the staff were reasonably helpful although duty manager on Saturday night never actually apologised for the room / noise but we were at least moved as promised. The reception area is very nice - a real throwback to older style architecture and decor which did appeal to me although probably not everyone, but then is all just personal taste.

The area outside the hotel is a little run down but it is a simple walk into town (approx 20 mins) and there are buses going to O'Connell Street if the walk is too far for you.

In all honesty however I think if we were ever travelling back to Dublin, we would probably stay elsewhere.",3,2011,05,31
248,Nothing special; underwhelming service; go elsewhere,"First, NEVER travel to a Catholic country on Good Friday - everything shuts down!
 
We arrived in Dublin on Good Friday, to a very busy lobby at the Camden Court. We asked at check-in when the restaurant closed, which was at 10:00. We relaxed in the room for a bit before calling to the front desk again to verify the closing time of the restaurant. Upon arriving at the restaurant at 7:00, however, we were told that it was a special Good Friday dinner and that a reservation was required, which we could not make because they were booked solid. 
Note: there were only a few tables with customers - the restaurant was almost empty! 

This was totally uncalled for, as the front desk told us twice that we had until 10:00 - they never mentioned reservations. The maitre-d', or manager, or whatever he was, was rather rude to us when he shooed us away to fend for ourselves in a city where all the pubs were closed.

We proceeded to walk the deserted streets of Dublin, searching for an open restaurant that would serve us a beer, in this birthplace of Guinness. Eventually we found a Kiwi pizza bar called Hell that was quite good. So our Good Friday was literally spent in Hell.

The room was smokey, although it claimed to be non-smoking. The outside noise was horrible, and the room was nothing special; our hallway was looong and red, reminding me very much of the hallway in The Shining. After experiencing the friendliness and hospitality of the Irish people everywhere else during our stay, the service at Camden Court was extremely lacking.",2,2011,05,30
248,Lovely city.....horrendous hotel,"Dublin is a lively, vibrant and friendly city with many great hotels, although the Camden Court is not one of them.

It is situated in an area full of night clubs and therefore has a constant stream of people coming and going in early hours.

The room had a stong smell of cigarette smoke and although the sheets were clean the pillows and duvet smelled of stale sweat.

The decor is dated and standards very basic- not nice, relaxing or pleasant.  If you want any kind if luxury or a good nights sleep do not stay here",1,2011,05,30
248,One night in the city,"Paid 125euros for double room only, nonrefundable rate.Does not include brekkie. This was a mistake as we could have booked the room for 135euros including brekkie. To get brekkie next morning cost us 13euros each!! And soo not worth it. It was good but not for 13 euros.Rooms were grand and the hotel has a wee swimming pool in the basement which was a nice surprise. There is parking but its tight there too!!
Great location with a bar on wexford st called 'Against the Grain' serving a selection of craft irish beers on draught, Galway Hooker, Dungarvan on draught, Oharas you name it!!",5,2011,05,25
248,Very nice hotel in a great city!,"This is a newer hotel in an older part of town, undergoing re-gentrification, close to Grafton Street, Dublin's shopping district.  Staff are attentive, helpful and charming.  This is Ireland after all!! Rooms are large and meet expectations of most people who travel from North America.  In addition, it is next door to a great Irish pub and not far from the must-see sights of Dublin.",5,2011,05,24
248,This is a very good hotel,"This is a very good hotel. The location is very good for city centre south and southside Dublin, just stroll down adjacent Harcourt St and you are at St Stephens Green. There is no charge for parking. Staff are very efficient and friendly. Room and common areas of hotel are kept very clean. Room service was prompt and food was very good and was hot. There is a pool and gym also but I didn't use them. My wife had a massage in the Pangea Spa which she said was very good. High up on my list of hotels for Dublin. This was my third time to stay in this hotel.",4,2011,05,23
248,"Great hotel, very well located.","Another trip away with the lads, 8 of us this time. Really clean and bright twin rooms, huge comfortable ground floor area including the reception and very impressive gym facility. To find the nearest pub was joined to the hotel was excellent and the novelty of pulling our own pints of Guinness at our own table was a Godsend. ( and very good value ) We went to watch the rugby in a really fantastic pub in Malahide and walked there from the City centre. Gibneys was excellent, great friendly craic, lovely people. Dublin was really enjoyable for our gang of mid-forty somethings and the Camden Court was good value and very central.",4,2011,05,23
248,A must if staying in dublin,"Recently stayed here with my partner for one night only in April 2011 and had a fantastic time,would not hesitate before booking again,helpful friendly staff,central location and excellent food,particularly enjoyed the rooms nautical theme as I am a huge fan of ""the greatest catch"",all in all a hidden gem in central Dublin and am looking forward to returning.",5,2011,05,18
248,Fantastic Hotel,Just stayed at Camden Court Hotel 3rd year on trot whilst attending Puncheston racing festival. Hotel in fantastic spot for everything very clean with great staff and fantastic food.,5,2011,05,07
248,"great hotel, good location,friendly staff and excellent leisure facilities.",We stayed for two nights in April 2011. Rooms were very clean and comfortable. Staff were very friendly and helpful. Leisure facilities were great especially the pool which is hard to find in city centre hotels. One negative though the bar only stocked limited wines and the evening meal in the hotel restaurant was average which contrasted with the breakfasts which were excellent. Perhaps the chef had an off night?,4,2011,05,06
248,Perfect,"Brought my husband for his special birthday and to celebrate his retirement, Everything was just perfect with this hotel the food room and  the cleanliness of all of the hotel and the hospitality of all your staff at the camden court. I requested a nice quiet room on a high floor, this was done for us. You have a beauitifull and friendly city to be proud of.
Look forward to coming again

248,Excellent Easter Break!!!,"Stayed with my girlfriend, Thursday 28th April to Monday 2nd May - and it really was a great stay start to finish.

Trip was geared around seeing Peter Kay at the 02 which was awesome! 

Flight was great, straight through the airport, and we got the aircoach into Dublin. All in all, about an hour from landing through to check in.

Hotel in excellent location, about a 10 minute walk to St Stephen's Green area. Tesco Express accross the road and the Bleeding Horse pub next door is great fun! 

We pre-booked the €50 3 course dinner with a free bottle of wine - excellent value here! Real good food in a nice restaurant area. €25 each for a 3 course meal with wine - you cant complain! 

Hotel itself was great. Nice bar area which did food itself all day. One big plus point was the swimming pool, jacuzzi, steam room and sauna setup! And the Gym! Nice facilities which were well looked after. 

Room was great. 5th Floor overlooking the courtyard, nice and quiet and pleasantly refurbished. Very modern feel to it - flatscreen, marble etc etc, with iron, tea/coffee etc

Would thoroughly recommend this hotel to all friends and family, and will hopefully return in the not too distant future!",5,2011,05,03
248,"Great facilities, location and staff but moisy in mornings","I stayed here with my daughter and was impressed with room, staff, breakfast, leisure club and location but was woken up every morning at shortly after 6am to the sound of what sounded like waste collection/recycling. I'm an early riser anyway but this was a tad too early even for me...",4,2011,04,22
248,great hotel with leisure center and free parking!,I would highly recommend this hotel if staying in dublin.Its about a 15 minute walk away from grafton street and st. stephens green which is great. The staff were all very friendly and helpful.The room was not huge by any means but was very clean and comfortable. Beakfast was lovely too. The leisure center is such an added bonus as is the free parking which is very rare with hotels in dublin.All in all i would highly recommend this hotel and will be booking in again soon.,4,2011,04,15
248,"If in Dublin, we will always stay at Camden Court","We stayed 2 nights in Dublin (our first night in Ireland and our last).  Both my partner and I were extremely happy with Camden Court.  Firstly, it is in the perfect location--walking distance to St. Stephen's Green, Temple Bar, etc.  Public transportation nearby.  We couldn't have picked a better spot.

The rooms were clean and the beds were very comfortable (which can be hard to find).  The pool and hot tub were lovely, but pretty crowded when we were there (5pm or so).  The breakfast was great.

The staff was amazing.  Everyone was extremely helpful and easy to smile.  What a great experience.  We checked in extremely early the first day (around 8am) at no extra charge.",5,2011,04,09
248,Breakfast A* Service A* Room A* Simples!,"Great value, comfortable rooms and breakfast in the restaurant was superb! A vast array of hot and cold choices, with the hot buffet served by a friendly breakfast chef. One of the best breakfasts I've sampled in a hotel. I topped up my ""Full Irish"" with cereals and croissants meaning I could skip lunch but still enjoy the day without going hungry!

We only used the pool once during our stay (Dublin has so much to see and do), but it was very well kept (swimming caps were compulsory). The sauna, jacuzzi & steam room were really nice too. It was refreshing to see a hotel where the leisure facilities are kept to an excellent standard - nothing to complain about, at all!

Location-wise - It's about 5-10 mins walk from St Stephen's Green and 15-20 mins from the busy shopping haven of Grafton Street, the popular Temple Bar area and other more central Dublin attractions. We bought a 2 day hop on/off bus pass and used St Stephen's Green as our 'return' stop, with approx 10 mins walk back to the hotel.

In terms of the room itself, we were given fresh clean towels every day. The beds were exceptionally clean & comfy too. We had tea and coffee making facilities in the room, and an iron & ironing board were also provided - meaning we didn't have to call room service once! To be honest, we didn't watch much telly but it was nice to have a big flat screen available to keep up to date with the news.

The staff were exceptionally friendly and helpful, although we didn't have much interaction with any of them apart from check in/out. One huge bonus was when we arrived quite early (around 10am) the receptionist allowed us to check into our room straight away and we weren't charged any extra, either!

Overall, our stay was very pleasant indeed. Dublin is a beautiful city with lots to see and do. If we went back, I would definitely stay at Camden Court again. I'm sure there are other equally good hotels in the city, but when you've had such a great experience why would you risk going anywhere else?",5,2011,04,08
248,Great value and even better service,"I just arrived from a 4 day trip with friends to Dublin.  The Camden Court is a spectacular value with clean rooms and impecible service.  All employees seem to take great pride in the hotel and it shows.
If you don't mind a little walk, this is fine location.  I was never in a taxi the entire trip and enjoyed walks to St. Stephen's Green, Trinity College, Guinness Storehouse, Temple Bar, St. Michan's, Jameson tour and the various (ok, a lot) of pubs.  
Speaking of pubs, don't miss The Bleeding Horse which is essentially attached to the Camden Court.
Well done to all.",4,2011,03,30
248,"A bit out of the way, but good value and nice to have a sauna","Have been here many times for business.  Good value, reasonable rooms, and great to have a pool, sauna, steam room in-situ.  Have tried many other Dublin hotels and this one is hard to beat for value.  Not the most central of locations, but 15 minutes walk gets you most places you want to be.  So nice to have irons and boards in the hotel rooms!  Breakfast is great.  As per most Dublin hotels, it can get noisy at night, particularly if you're overlooking the inner courtyard as they collect bottle banks at strange times.  Closing the window will solve this - but there's no aircon, so it can get a little stuffy.",4,2011,03,14
248,Nothing special but the breakfast is amazing!,"The hotel offers a decent location, about a one mile walk to the main streets of Dublin, but the light rail is about a block away. the Bleeding Horse Pub is next door and worth a visit. The rooms ranged from closest-sized to immense for members of our group. The breakfast was very nice and filling, with a large selection of hot and cold dishes.  A comfortable stay but nothing to write homer about.",3,2011,03,11
248,great second visit,"We booked through Superbreaks and for the second time got 3 nights for the price of two !! 
We arrived at the camden court hotel at around 9.00 A M hoping that we could leave our bags in the luggage room until check-in time however the receptionist  told us our room was ready & allowed us to have an early check-in at no extra cost . ( the hotel also gave us a late check-out at no extra cost...great bonus )
The room was a good size triple en-siute with doulble & single beds. we had tea/coffee makig facilities , flat screen TV and most importantly a comfy bed ! !
The hotel has swimming pool ( everyone has to wear a swimming hat and these can be bought for 2 euros in the hotel ), jacuzzi, sauna & steam room which my wife and I thoughroughly enjoyed & made very good use of on each day of our stay.
The breakfast was very enjoyable with most things any one could want , cereals, fruit, cold meats and of couse ""the full irish""  breakfast !  
The hotel is fairly central , 10 - 15 min walk to St Stephens Green , Grafton st, Temple bar and not  that far away from any city attractions.
For those people who don't fancy the walk into town the LUAS tram line  is just around the corner from the hotel .
There are several pubs & restaurants near the camden court we mainly used the Bleedin' Horse which is next door to the hotel and was fairly good value by Dublin pub prices and has a good atmosphere & well worth a visit. Little Caesar italian restuarant is also nearby and  worth visitng it has a good early bird menu & reasonably priced otherwise.
Dublin is an expensive city but people know that before going & judging by the number of tourists we met it clearly does not put people off .This was our second stayat the camden court hotel and wont be our last ! !",4,2011,03,09
248,Relaxing short stay,"My daughter & myself have just returned from a 3 night bed & breakfast stay at the Camden Court Hotel in Dublin. We had a fantastic time & thoroughly enjoyed our relaxing stay at this lovely hotel. The rooms were clean & airy, we had clean towels & maid service every day. The beds were clean & comfy, we had tea making facilities in the room, an iron & ironing board were also provided. Breakfast was fantastic loads of choice, fresh fruit, cereal, toast & full irish breakfast were all available. After breakfast we went to the spa & made use of the pool, sauna & jacuzzi there was also a steam room & a gym all of these facilities were spotless, & a nice relaxing start to the day . All of these were at no extra charge & towels were provided, A swimming cap is required before entering the pool we hadn't packed any but were able to purchase 2 for 5 euros. We were a short walking distance from the centre of Dublin (10mins) & the shopping was fantastic. This is my first time in Dublin but I would definately return & would also return to the Cambden Court Hotel",5,2011,03,08
248,perfect...!!!,"The hotel was lovely...though our room was a little small it was perfect for a couple. Staff were extremely helpful. Breakfast was brilliant and all the facilities were amazing.
Definitely would stay again...and a nice distance from the tourist attractions.",5,2011,03,03
248,Would recommend this hotel and would return also,"Booked 3 nights at this hotel with breakfast, excellent value, spacious room, large bathroom, (no 601) top floor opposite lift. The breakfast were fab, jacuzzi, steam & sauna all excellent, main pool too cool for my liking but my daughter and husband liked it.  You have to wear a cap to swin in the pool, but the hotel sell them for a reasonable charge.  Only 10-15 minute walk to Temple Bar, River, shopping centre's etc.  Rooms cleaned every day, with clean towels and were all done by the time we had breakfast and came back to set off for the day.  Only problem was on our last night, 2 goons thought it would be a good idea to sit on the sofa opposite the lift outside our room and shout/sing along to their mobile phone music while drinking more alcohol, I went out and told them we were trying to sleep (5am) they went then, but not before they left the cups they were drinking out of, right outside of our room!!!!   Would still go back, staff all friendly and excellent service in all departments and the bar food in central bar excellent too.",5,2011,02,27
248,Fantastic hotel with a Leisure Centre!!,I stayed here for two nights on business. It was a last minute trip to Dublin and a friend of mine recommended this hotel. I was first blown away with the fact they had a complimentary carpark! Complimentary WIFI and carpark! Hard to find a free carpark in Dublin City these days! Perfect location if you need to be in city centre. I needed to get a pair of shoes and all I had to do was walk 5 minutes down the road to Grafton Street! Hotel staff extremely helpful and friendly. Food was delicious. Fancy swimming pool. Rooms were spacious and clean. Service fantastic. I'll be back!!!!,5,2011,02,24
248,Perfect hotel,"Visted Dublin for the first time so wanted a hotel close to all the sights with a pool.
I fouind it differcult to find a hotel within my budget with a pool so this is why we choose camden court hotel. I would stay here again 
great location with plenty to do in the area",4,2011,02,20
248,Convenient,"A good value big hotel. Rooms were cleaned everyday. Hot water and heating working. Ideal base from which to explore Dublin.

One downpoint is that we like to use the stairs rather than the the lift. Stairs could be carpeted and walls painted. Also, rooms could be fitted with a mini-bar. Do these and you have yourself a powerful hotel. We will return in May.",4,2011,02,11
248,"What's another word for ""excellent service""?","I was a guest this past weekend (23\01\11) with 10 other of my fellow companions. I have never been so delighted to find great service, and freindly faces. The staff was very so helping, the lobby very so hospitable, the facilities were (are) kept clean. 
The rooms, very clean, service was always punctual, the sheets and blankets are clean, and the bathroom also. However, didn't like the fact that it didn't have any ventilation....(lol)
It is located very near the centre. It had been the first time I had gone to Dublin, and we are all happy with the experience we had received. I recomend to many to stay at this hotel. You won't be sorry. 
Thank you for the pleasent stay. I will if I do go back be staying at this hotel again.",5,2011,01,28
248,Above average for a Dublin 3* hotel - we will return,"You never know quite what you're going to get with Dublin hotels. I chose the Camden Court for its proximity to our course venue and its free parking and it turned out to be a good choice.

At around €80 per night without breakfast it wasn't exactly cheap. But then most other places charge for parking - so swings and roundabouts, I guess. Anyway, our room was refurbished nicely, and was clean. Reception staff were very pleasant and helpful. We only stayed one night and didn't have time to use the leisure centre but it's good to know it's there. 

I'd requested a quiet room which was on the 6th floor at the back. My husband did find the external aircon noisy (it didn't bother me) but slept fine with earplugs. I don't suppose that can be avoided if you like to sleep with the window open, but we were spared the more intrusive street noise. 

Overall, we were happy with the hotel. We attend our course several times a year (we're a ""mature"" couple btw and like our comforts) and have previously stayed at the 4* Burlington which is 20 minutes walk further from our  venue. I've had good deals there before but for that Saturday night they wanted €30 more - too much. So I would be happy to stay at the Camden Court again. Who knows - we might even become regulars!",4,2011,01,28
248,"Great Location, Great Atmosphere","I stayed at the Camden Court for an extended weekend break with friends in October.  The location is superb, within walking distance of St. Stephens Green, Grafton St. etc.  Staff are very friendly & most helpful & there genuinely is an extremely welcoming feel.  We had a drink in the bar on evenings after dinner & before venturing down town & the atmosphere was surprisingly good for a hotel bar. Overall a very comfortable stay & definitely worth a re-visit.",5,2011,01,12
248,Excellent hotel with friendly staff,"We stayed at the hotel for 3 nights over the New Year. The location of the hotel was great for a nice brisk walk into the city centre. The surrounding area looks a little rough but we found the people outside the hotel great and very friendly. The hotel itself was lovely. When we arrived we had a warm welcome for the reception staff and nothing was too much trouble. They were very polite and efficient at their job and we were booked in quickly. The hotel was very clean and our room was great. We had room service daily. They were also very good making the bed, tidying and changing the towels. The breakfast was included within the price and the head waiter was very polite in the morning and the standard of food was very good with plenty to eat for breakfast. We bought an evening meal at the hotel on our last night which was three courses and it was reasonable priced, presented well and tasted great. The facilities within the hotel were good, although the pool was not working but that was not the hotels fault and they tried hard to keep the other facilities open despite Ireland having a water shortage. We expected to pay it little more for our drinks but we were surprised that they were much the same as outside and that was great if you wanted a night in. We had a great time at the hotel and I would like to thank all the staff for the welcome and professionalism shown which is great and goes to making a fabulous weekend away. As for Dublin it was brilliant and the Irish people we met were very friendly and we will have no hesitation to return and stay at the same hotel which we have recommended to our friends.",5,2011,01,07
248,"Personally, one of the best hotels I have stayed in!","Stayed here over the new year for 4 nights, the rooms were spotless, the staff were helpful and cheerful, the location was excellent and my personal favourite the breakfast included in the excellent room rate was delicious! Could not find a fault!!",5,2011,01,05
248,Very disappointed,"Stayed overnight in this hotel and was very disappointed. I had requested a quiet non smoking room on booking a room on the hotel website. However the room was noisy and as none of the room doors on that floor seem to close properly everyone, had to slam their doors making it impossible to sleep. The weather outside was freezing and the room was cold - there didn't appear to be temperature control in the room to heat it up and there were no extra blankets in the room so had to sleep with coat on top of bed for heat. The bathroom was clean but in need of update. Although my room was non-smoking I think the room opposite was a smoking room as I could smell cigarettes in the corridor and inside the bedroom door.

The breakfast was average but room service was punctual.

Check out was poor. There was only one person working and four people waiting to check out. The receptionist  then proceeded to answer a telephone call during check out and left everyone else waiting. The staff member was extremely rude and when I asked for the manager they too were very unprofessional. When I asked a basic question they raised their eyes to heaven and tutted as they went off to try and get the answer, commenting to their colleague as they went, obviously not realising that I could see their actions.",2,2010,12,12
248,Good reasonable hotel,"We stayed here for 4 nights in November 2010. The lobby is very nice and comfortable to sit around in, there is also a nice bar. The pool is really nice as are the steam and sauna and jacuzzi. The changing rooms are a bit cold and grubby but fine. Even having to wear a swim cap isn't the end of the world. The hotel room was freezing when we arrived but after adjusting the radiator it was ok although the heating was switched off during the day so it took a while to warm up each evening. Room was big and clean and reasonably quiet for dublin. Area was nice, 10 mins into town and some lovely cafes within a couple of minutes. Would stay here again.",4,2010,11,29
248,"Excellent location and amenities, a solid value choice","Only a few blocks from St. Stephen's Green, the Camden Court was our hotel for a four day Thanksgiving holiday stay.  The hotel has an extremely helpful and friendly staff, a fine pool and workout room and comfortable beds in an otherwise average room.  We would certainly stay there again, especially at the $85/night rate we paid on Hotwire, but would insist on a room off the street, as midnight revelers in the street created a lot of noise in Room 318 (which faces the street).",4,2010,11,29
248,highly recommended,"If you are planning a break to Dublin I would not hesitate to recommend Camden Court. From check in to check out employees from management to waiting staff all excelled. Bedrooms warm,comfortable and clean, pool, sauna and steam room just the place to relax and unwind. Excellent choices at breakfast from freshly prepared fresh fruit salad daily to cooked food served by the chef. A pleasant 15 minute walk down Harcourt Street and  you are at the hub of busy city life or a quiet stroll through St Stephen's Green. Fabulous restaurants nearby ie La Mere Zou, Il Primo and Little Ceasars!",4,2010,11,20
248,Camden courting custom but not couples!,"My  Partner and I  decided to take a  3 day break in Dublin and opted to stay at the Camden Court  Hotel about a mile from the City centre. We arrived early and were extremely pleased with the efficient booking in and to be told our room was ready, which was really welcome. The room itself, was at the rear of the hotel overlooking the car park/taxi drop off and pick up point.The room itself wasn't especially well decorated, the wall was marked and generally felt cold. The bathroom was better but the shampoo and shower gels provided were poor and a bit unpleasent to use.  Tea/coffee making was ok. The sound on the t.v didnt really work very well on one speaker cutting in and out..The Restaurant was ok,  generally  nice and clean but it lacked atmosphere and in the evening wasn't well attended, beyond a large and noisy party of elderly american tourists. The second night in the Restaurant wasn't much better with the Manager tut tuting that we hadn't booked a table, even though the place was empty, bar ourselves and one other table  full of Priests, out on a jolly.  The Manager soon disappeared and afterwards anyone else wishing to dine late i.e after 8p.m had to seek help from the Reception Desk.  A three course meal set us back,  25 euros ahead plus an average bottle of wine at 18  euros - on reflection we should have eaten out ,as we did for breakfast up the road in a Cafe called 'Yum Yums, offering great value at 6 euros a head!(Dublin doesnt need to be expensive) The only thing that wasn't very good in the Hotel was the fact the children seemed to be playing throughout the Lobby and into the Bar after 9p.m. In fact, children seemed everywhere,  given the number of large family groups taking up most of the space. I feel there should be a limit to the concept of being family friendly here, during the late evening.",3,2010,11,18
248,A decent option in Dublin,"While the lobby was very nice and modern, the rooms left a little to be desired.  They hadn't been recently updates and ours was right next to the elevator which made it a little loud.

The hotel is in a good spot, within easy walking distance to many attractions in Dublin.  That was a definite ""plus.""  

The hotel also offers free parking which is nice. 

The staff was friendly enough and helpful when asked.",3,2010,11,05
248,Great Hotel in Excellent Location,"Third visit to this hotel, and we were delighted to be allocated one of the newly renovated rooms.  Lovely decor, beautiful en-suite.
A few niggles, why do they put two single duvets on the super king-size bed? Far too heavy in the middle!
Also, the lighting is great for atmosphere, but no decent light at any mirror for putting on make-up.  This is a common problem in most hotels, though.
Great leisure centre-a wonderful way to unwind before the night ahead.",4,2010,11,02
248,nice cheap and clean hotel,"the hotel not far from the city center of dublin offers a nice, cheap and clean accommodation. The stuff is really friendly and helpful. The rooms are small but clean and quite. I can recommend this small hotel and next time when we get the chance to come to Dublin we will try to stay in this hotel again.",4,2010,10,31
248,"Good location, comfortable bed, friendly staff","My partner and I stayed here for a weekend for our anniversary and for the marathon.  I had asked for a quiet room and was given a room which faced the courtyard at the back.  The curtains were heavy and the bed comfortable so I slept well.
The location is great, 15 minute walk to Grafton street and 20 minutes walk to temple bar. On Camden Street itself there are plenty of nice cafes, bars and restaurants (Cafe Sophia is really friendly and Yum Yums is packed on a Sunday for the fabulous breakfasts.)  On our first night we had burritos from a great little mexican - Burritos and Blues, on the corner of Cuffe Street - highly recommended (cheap, tasty and filling).  

The room was modern and felt very clean. There were only basic facilities though - kettle, iron, hair dryer and t.v (with poor reception on some channels) and the toiletries consisted of 2 shower caps, shower gel and soap.  Don't expect fluffy robes, trouser press, nice shampoo or biscuits here.  The bar was expensive - but thats to be expected.  The shower screen leaked a little and the bath was small.

However these are all minor details and I cant say really affected my stay.
The staff were helpful, allowing us to return after we had run the marathon and shower in the gym even though we had already checked out.  

It wasn't luxury but I don't go on holiday to spend my whole day enjoying the hotel.",5,2010,10,27
248,Very nice hotel close to everything,"Visited Dublin for 3 nights, had great time, we had one of rhe refurnished rooms,  very modern, clean, within 10 mintues or so walk of the center, great pubs nearby.  Free safe underground parking which put my mind at ease and kept our motorbikes clean and dry.  Wifi in the rooms too which was handy, our room was at the back so very quiet, nice thick curtains kept it nice and dark too.

Nice pool/  jacuzzi, bit annoying having to wear a swimming hat tho.

The bar was expensive, we went out to the pubs nearby for food and drink, there was a great cafe called yum yums where we ate every morning.  Overall very pleased with the hotel, a quality hotel within good distance of everywhere at a reasonable price.",5,2010,10,25
248,"Good, not great","I stayed here for 4 nights to meet with friends.

the hotel is not right  in the city centre but is pretty close - you can walk into the city centre in 10-15 minutes or get a bus for E2.20.

In general, I was pleased with the hotel - the room was clean, the bed comforable and the staff generally pleasant. The lobby is pleasant, with lots of big, comfortable sofas and chairs.

My room rate did not include breakfast - I did have breakfast one morning (at a cost of 13E) - there is a buffet of cereals, yogurt, toast / pastries and full cooked breakfast. Portions were generous and there was good choice, but it was very much 'generic hotel breakfast' - it'll fill you up if you want a solid start to the day.
(if you have time to go out,, the Cake Cafe in Pleasants Place offers excellent breakfasts, with treats such as soda bread, pancakes and cooked breakfasts, cooked to yur order !)

The swimming pool and jacuzzi were very pleasant - I didn't use the fitness centre but it appeared to be fairly well equipped.

however, there were some relatively minor issues which stop me giving this hotel 5 stars:

- The toiletries provided seemed rather cheap and unpleasant. I was a little surprised that they provided generic shower gel/shampoo. It was adequate a shower gel, (although with a rather unpleasant scent)  but hopeless as shampoo. A disappointment as, due to the airport restrictions I had not brought shampoo on the basis that a good quality hotel woud provide this.

- Staff were generally very friendly and helpful, once one could get ttheir attention, but I noted several occasins where staff seemed to ignore guests - for instance, on 2 separate occasions I saw staff at reception dealing with filing / printouts while ignoring people waiting at reception (without even acknowledging them) - a quick apology and mention that the guest woulld be seen very soon would have gone an awfully long way! 

- There was free wi-fi in the hotel but, rather irritatingly, no information in the 'guest information' folder in the room about how to access it.. Similarly, the information provided about the TV channels available was inaccurate. Neither of these is a major issue but they are little things which could easily be fixed, to give a more professional impression.

- The hairdyers in the rooms were very old fashioned, fixed to one of the drawers in the desk, and very feeble. (The dryers in the changing rooms for the swimming pool were much more effective)

- there was tea & coffee provided in the rooms, however, given that the hotel paces itself as a luxery hotel, it would have been nice had biscuits and herbal teas been  provided.

All in all, a pleasant hotel, and one I'd be happy to stay here again, but a few small improvements would back a big difference.",4,2010,10,25
248,Very good choice,Good location and nice rooms. Breakfast was very good and abundant. Very good experience.,4,2010,10,24
248,fantastic weekend,"A great hotel, had everything you could possibly need. Great location near all the nightlife of dublin and only a 5 minute walk from stephens green. Fantastic staff very helpful and attentive. Secure parking in the hotel and a pool in the basement for an early morning swim. The only problem was the room was street facing and so traffic noise was the only issue. Although great value hotel.",4,2010,10,22
248,never again!!!,this is a below average hotel.Our room was freezing cold as the heating only comes on at 5pm!there were stains on our sheets i had to ring reception to get clean bed clothes.That night the rad in the room made fierce noise it sounded like we were on a run way at an airport.once again i had to complain at reception. The girl at reception was nice and gave us a different room. This room was ok only the rad didn't work so the room was freezing all the time.The breakfast was only ok nothing special the glasses for the juices were dirty.i was never so happy to leave a hotel! the only good thing about this place is the location and the swimming pool.,2,2010,10,20
248,We will stay there again.,"Clean, friendly, relaxed, big rooms, good breakfast.
Can't say anything negative.",5,2010,10,17
248,OK - but needs a spruce up!,"We stayed in the Camden Court for a short break in August.  We had spent quite some time searching for a suitable hotel and we ended up going with the Camden Court because the price was reasonable, it was within walking distance of Temple Bar, and there was free parking and a pool.  Not many hotels close to the city centre offer these facilities, so these were definitely plus points!

The reception area of the hotel is very plush and modern, but the rooms are not quite as fresh looking and although they are clean and perfectly reasonable, I still think they could do with a bit of a revamp.  The pool area and changing rooms would also benefit from a bit of refurbishment - some of the tiles were cracked and a shower was leaking all the floor in the changing rooms.  Also, they make you buy a dopey swimming cap before you can go into the pool!

The breakfast was fine but again, not exactly out of this world.  However, there was a good choice of hot and cold foods and the staff were polite and helpful.

All in all, the Camden wasn't bad for the price and the free parking is a real bonus.  I might stay there again if I go back to Dublin.",3,2010,10,10
248,Clean new hotel was the best on our trip,"The Camden Court was a brief overnight stop for our last night in our fly/drive holiday. The rooms were large enough, very clean with a good bathroom. There was free laptop internet, free parking, and the best breakfast buffet of the trip. Many goode restaurants are nearby; ask the staff for recommendations.
We would definitely stay here again. The only warning is not about the hotel, but driving in Dublin south of the River Liffey. Many streets are one way, and even taking a taxi involves going in a number of unexpected directions to reach the hotel.",5,2010,10,09
248,Great Venue!!,"I recently held a conference in the Camden Court Hotel. Everything ran so smoothly from begining to end! I had heard about this venue through a friend of mine in another company - and everything he raved about - I can rave about and add to it!? We all stayed in the hotel over the two days. Bedrooms were comfortable (with free WIFI) and I got a great nights sleep! Staff were fantastic from check in to check out and nothing seemed like it was any trouble especially in the conference centre, My colleague had a problem with his laptop and a nice young man from the department got it sorted in no time! If he wasn't there, I don't know what we would have done! Food is great in the restaurant. The last day of our meeting was on Arthurs Day and we finished off the day in the hotel bar with a complimentary pint of guinness! Great finish!",5,2010,10,06
248,"A Brilliant hotel, fabulous location... and free parking!!!","We decided to stay here as it was near the city centre, had a pool, etc and free parking.  Great secure under ground parking, one of the only places we found with free parking! Hotel a 5min walk into city centre (even closer than we'd thought). The hotel lobby is beautiful and people seemed to enjoy sitting and reading there. Didn't go in the bar, but looked nice with reasonable price of drinks and food. Room fairly basic but nice and clean, and excellent added bonus of free safe. Used the leisure facilities which were nice, I don't agree with the review that the pool was cold... maybe compared with a bath it is? Good steam room and nice sauna, shame the jacuzzi wasn't working. Didn't use the gym but it seemed good. These facilties were a nice added bonus and a good reason for staying in this hotel. Could not fault location, loads of cafes and conveniences on the road the hotel was on, and so close to city centre. I would most deifintely stay here again if we were going back to Dublin, so glad we picked this hotel and not one of the cheaper ones on the outskirts.",5,2010,10,04
248,Great Hotel/Great Location/Great Staff,"Just came back from the Camden Court. stayed 9/26 & 9/27. We found the hotel to be in a great location, you can walk to everything the town has to offer. If walking is hard to do, the city bus stop is just across the road. The bedroom and bath were very clean and were a nice size, the resturant was very good and offered a great breakfast buffett at 7:00am, the hotel staff was very good and very helpful. Many pubs & resturants, cafe's are next to the hotel. I would highly recommend this hotel .",5,2010,10,03
248,no problems here,stayed one night and never had any complaints. If in dublin again would stay again. very close to all the sights and bus routes.,5,2010,10,01
248,The staff are out of this world,"im always a bit wary staying in dublin, being a proper culchie.lol.always expect the staff to act like im straight out of the bog, but i cant say enough about the staff in the place..was just in for the one night, at an engagement party, and they couldnt have been nicer...nothing was too much trouble and its a great hotel, a right gem easy to get to from everywhere.had a great night and will be staying here every time i go back to dublin. and i have to mention brendan behind the bar, the poster boy for dublin hospitality. kept us entertained all night and im sure some of us were a handful.",5,2010,09,06
248,Place I'd stay again for Dublin City Center,"I'd recommend this hotel to tourists and anyone else who wants a good value stay in a central Dublin location.  Why?  Great location 5 minute walk from St. Stephen's Green, a nice indoor pool with kids area, a gym of a decent size... it's a 3 star but has a nice appearance...good a great deal online...other hotels in Dublin are overpriced..doesn't include breakfast but tons of coffee shops around the corner... Nice pub too called ""bleeding horse"" built in 1649....free newspapers and wireless internet bounus.",5,2010,09,03
248,Dissopointing!,"Stayed in this Hotel last week. It was more expensive that other hotels nearer the citycenre but really picked this hotel because of its leisure facilities. When i got there i was happy enough with the room and the breakfast was good enough. The dowm turn was that when we went into the swimming pool is was cold and the Jacuzzi wasnt working. . . very dissopointing considering why we stayed at the hotel. Also on the second day when we went to shower and shave no hot water! we were told our alternate were to shower in the gym or change rooms. Apart from that our shower was covered in some liquid from prev guests!
For these reasons i was annoyed. But it was very good that there was free parking and also free internet. Thanks",3,2010,09,02
248,OK if you can sleep through anything,"Stayed here from the 10th to the 13th August on a Room Only basis.
Room was a good size for me and my sister and the beds were comfy.
We decided to try the breakfast on the first morning and realised that it was a good idea that we didnt pay for the Bed and Breakfast basis. The other two mornings we ate at Rhubarbs, a cafe just down the road from the hotel. You can get the same breakfasts' that are offered at the hotel but at half the price.
Went to the swimming pool only once - had to pay 2.50 for a swimming hat (even my dad had to have one despite the fact he is bald). Was alright but wasnt one of the best hotel swimming pools i have been to. 
Myself, my sister and my mum all had our nails done - good price for what you get and the nail technician is very friendly. 
i gave the sleep quality only a one as me and my sister were unable to sleep due to the fact there was an irish couple in the room next door that decided to have arguements at 3am. this happened two nights of the three and nothing was done about it. the walls seemed rather thin for a hotel.
overall this hotel is good for the location - it is possible to get the Dublin Tours of the city which are very good to get information about the city and to use as a mode of transport.",3,2010,08,13
248,Great Location and Value,"I was in Dublin a few days ago (Aug 1-9) to celebrate my b-day.  It was my first time in Ireland.  My best friend and I stayed at the Camden Court Hotel, which I selected because it was fairly close to the night life (Temple Bar Area) but not smack in the middle of it (so we can get some sleep).   I was pleasantly surprised at how close alot of local pubs were to the hotel.  The Bleeding Horse is a large happening pub right next door.  Very convenient after a night full of irish beer - we walked all of 2mins to our hotel next door.  We also met the pub owner and DJs one night and they invited us to an ""after party"" when the pub closed.  Very friendly staff and great irishmen :)  Down the same street as the hotel, there are a number of traditional pubs and restaurants so everything is pretty much walking distance.  Dublin Castle, Temple Bar, and Graften Street (shopping area) are all about 15-20mins walking distance away - and I consider myself a ""stroller"".  You

I was there for 7 nights and most of them were quiet minus 1-2 nights were there was noise from party-ers on the street and sometimes I could hear people in the hallways.  But this was only occasional and considering the number of pubs within walking distance, I considered the hotel to be decently quiet at night.  The hotel appears to have alot of business people (suits) and ""families"", so you won't run into partyers at the hotel itself.  That's nice for those who want to go pubbing down the street and come back to a quiet sleep.

I also picked this hotel because it was the only hotel in it's class/area with a gym, which has become important to me when I'm on travel.  The fitness facilities was very nice for this class of hotel.  I did not use the pool, but I heard good comments about it when I was there.

For the price - I got a great deal online - I though the hotel facilities (gym) was excellent.  The room was large and suitable for 2 people.  The bathroom was also larger than I expected.  Everything was clean and comfortable, but not lavish.  The free internet was a great bonus!",4,2010,08,10
248,Central - good for kids,Very central with free parking - good size family room with 3 double beds.  Room a bit warm at night and noisy with window open.  Great pool and breakfast at really good price - would stay again.,4,2010,08,10
248,Great value hotel.,"A great hotel, about a fifteen minute walk from the top of Grafton St. Very near the Tripod and Crawdaddy venues. Extremely good value for the city centre. Loads of free parking(a big bonus in Dublin) and a lovely leisure centre. While the dowstairs lobby, bar and restaurant were of a four star standard the rooms themselves were basic,but spotlessly clean with flat screen tv and free wi-fi. The food served at the Iveagh restaurant in the hotel was far superior to usual hotel fare and good value at 25 euro for 3 courses and tea and coffee ,all night long. At 79 euro on a bank holiday Saturday night, we'll definitely be back.",5,2010,08,07
248,Good value for money,Stayed for 1 night which included an evening meal and a show at the gaiety theatre and I have to say it was exellent value and the food was great. 10 mins walk and you in the hub of it. The hotel rooms are clean and basic. I would stay again.,4,2010,07,24
248,Dirty,"We stayed at the hotel for one night and it was awefully dirty underneath the bed. Walls were  damaged with paint falling off the wall. Asked for another room. Funny enough that it was equally dirty underneath the bed. Though discussions with the manager were not productive in the first place, she promised a 50% discount for the inconvenience. At least acceptable.",2,2010,07,22
248,Nothing wrong and nothing outstanding.,"I can make my points quick on this one. Average rooms, clean, staff do the job efficiently. Average price and only a 10 minute walk to the thick of it. Has off road parking outside hotel. Good base to get your head down. Overall nothing to worry about. My only petty gripe was queing for breakfast. Reminded me of school dinner que. Get some staff to come to the table and ask you what you wish for breakfast. This would be much better. Would stay there again though.",3,2010,07,20
248,Good hotel,"Just returned from 3 nights in Dublin. Fantastic stay at the hotel, just 10 minutes from the city centre, you can walk, catch the bus or dart to the centre. We caught the dart just behind the hotel that brought you out at St Stephens Green and the top of Grafton Street.
Temple Bar was fantastic, lots of music and atmosphere. Check out the open top bus for a two day pass, you can use it to hop on and off all over Dublin either to see the landmarks or  to just get to where you want to go. The standard of service and food in the bars is excellent.
Breakfast in the hotel is a must. Reception staff friendly and welcoming, leisure club is good and housekeeping always said hello. 
So tired after every day that we had no problem with any noise, perhaps the Guinness helped a little bit.?? 
We will be going back.",4,2010,07,16
248,"Reasonable hotel, good location","I stayed here for 3 nights in April on a business trip.  The hotel is well situated on a side street within easy walk of St Stephens Green and near a good tram stop.  The room was average, a bit dated and overlooking a car park.  The breakfast buffet was very good and I think the overall rate for the room, considering the location and facilities (which unfortunately I did not have time to explore) was good value.",3,2010,07,16
248,Very Misleading Hotel Website,Stayed at the Camden Court for two nights at the end of a 10 day trip to Europe and this was the worst hotel. This hotel was listed as a 4 star hotel.  The lobby was beautiful but once you take the elevator up to your room it is a totally different scene.  We had 4 rooms out of 12 of us.  The rooms were old looking and needed fresh paint.  There was no air conditioner so the windows needed to be open and the neighborhood was loud.  The two family rooms were located right on the main street and the kids could not sleep all night.,2,2010,07,13
248,Great value for money and better than expected,"We stayed here over an extended weekend and the hotel turned out to be a pleasant surprise.  It was clean and comfortable and although close to town, it was quiet at night.  Shopping and such is only a 10-15 min walk and so are the bar and restaurant areas.  If you are here by RyanAir, the bus stop is also a 10-15 min walk so not too bad.  The staff was also very nice and friendly.",4,2010,07,13
248,Very good Hotel,"It was a really nice hotel with good service and location.
If you have any whishes, they do their best to help you.
Good breakfast, but I missed vegetables like fresh tomato/cucumber etc. And boiled eggs..
The Central Bar was nice and good food.",4,2010,07,10
248,Lovely trip away. Great hotel.,"We booked here after checking out review on tripadvisor and have to say we weren't disappointed. Fairly close to major attractions. 10 minute walk. The room was clean, comfortable and everything went fine. 

I could see what other reviewers said about the choice of wall colour in the rooms. There were some scratches to the paint work and a couple of small marks on the carpet. If this is the kind of thing that is going to annoy you then dont stay here. But room was very comfortable, spacious and clean.

Only criticisms would be the generator which, even on the 6th floor, could be quiet noisy at night. The other was one morning the maid tried to get in our room at 8am to tidy. Although we hadn't used the ""do not disturb"" we had locked the door and she knocked twice till we answered.

But other than this we had a great stay. Didnt eat in the hotel but did have a drink and service was always first class. All staff were courteous and professional.

Based on other reviews, we had breakfast in yum yums about a 5 minute walk into town from the hotel. Breakfasts were fab! Also suggest a drink in the Bleeding Horse pub right next door to the hotel. Apparently oldest pub in Dublin (aren't they all) but it was a great wee boozer and really reasonably priced (for Dublin). For a cheap dinner, we ate in Eddie Rockets, again 5 mins walk. Seems to be a chain but the burgers are amazing!

Would definitely recommend it and would stay again. Bring your swimming costume - just in case you fancy a swim or a sauna.",4,2010,07,07
248,A home from home.,"If you want a relaxing, elegant home from home then look no further than the Camden Court Hotel.  Great food and excellent service are only surpassed by the quality sleep in the spotless, airy bedrooms. Have stayed here on many occasions and now  take the Camden experience for granted. Location is great too with  Grafton street less than 10 minutes walk away. Consistently friendly and helpful staff set the tone in this well managed hotel. Would not hesitate to recommend the Camden Court Hotel.",5,2010,06,22
248,Why such high ratings?? Misleading.,"Dublin was the last stop on our weeklong stay in Ireland. As with any lodging, I did my homework on TripAdvisor (and elsewhere) and felt confident about it's 4/5 ""very good"" average review, 85% recommendation rate and photos. The reality was quite different. I don't know if people are getting overly generous with their reviews/ratings but this is the 2nd time in several months that I have been disappointed with lodging that received high marks on TripAdvisor. 

In short, we walked into a nicely decorated lobby area and checked into the hotel early on a thursday evening. We were given a room on the 4th floor and proceeded up on the elevator. Upon entering the room, we found accomodations that were 1 star at best. A room in very poor condition that beared no resemblance to the pictures we saw and the description and reviews we read. A basic bed with an old bedspread... end tables on either side of the bed but NO lamps or phone on either one... large, ugly scratches on the wall behind the bed frame (presumably from moving it back forth?)... worn furniture with a big sticker on the front of a desk drawer indicating it housed a blow dryer... 2 small pictures hung on one wall with large metal tabs on either side of the frame screwed into the wall (in case we wanted to steal the lovely artwork)... and top it off with an dated room (pinkish carpet and faded red bedspread) and bathroom that clearly hadn't been updated in ages.

We called the front desk to express our disappointment and said the room didn't match what was described. After further explaining that the problem was the condition of the room, the young woman said she would see if they had a different room and call me back. She called back and said she would come up to the room and bring us to a new room. We were moved to a new room on the 4th floor that was like night and day from the first room... newly updated with new carpeting and furniture, new trendy looking bedspread, and even lamps on the end tables! Wow! The second room was fine and to their credit, they moved us without making a big issue out of it. In my opinion though, they lost all credibility and should be totally ashamed for even trying to put a guest in the first room. Clearly, they have renovated part of the hotel but are willing to put guests in rooms that are a much closer match to a cheap, run down motel than a 3 star, moderately expensive hotel.

While the second room was fine, it was still unimpressive. The bathroom had been updated on a nickel budget and had the old basic floor and shower tile, a cheap, plastic toilet and paper thin towels that were frayed along the edges. As long as get one of the updated rooms at a fair price and have expectations of a basic room in a decent neighborhood (albeit with a couple abandoned & severely run-down buildings across the street), you'll be satisfied. If you're hoping for something more, I'd look elsewhere.",2,2010,06,21
248,Great hotel,"We had an excellent stay at this hotel. Rooms are small but the beds are good. Great leisure room and good swimming pool and sauna. Breakfast was good. Nice location as well, close to the park and shopping streets.",4,2010,05,26
248,great choice of hotel,"I'm just back from a shopping trip in dublin and I managed to book the camden court hotel on the lidl break.

It was excellent value for money and the service and hospitality from the staff was wonderful... the restaurant staff were exceptional.

We had a beautiful meal and a really nice bottle of wine to go with it.

Great swimming pool which was just the treat for tired feet!!

Breakfast the next morning was wonderful with a superb buffet ... 

next time I'm in dublin I will return as it is only minutes walk from the city and is perfect location for anyone going on a shopping spree!!!

I look forward to my next visit to dublin....",4,2010,05,11
248,great hotel!!,"I stayed in the Camden Court Hotel on Sunday 2nd May - on a very low budget break .... not expecting much but I have to say ... it was excellent!!

Our meal which was included was superb... plenty of it!!

We had a dew drinks in the bar which was lovely but we hit the city on sunday night so didnt stay around to see what the atmosphere was like in the bar in the evening.

Our room was small and basic, possibly needs some repainting done - b ut otherwise was fine and we had no problems!  It was spotlessly clean!

the breakfast buffet was again wonderful each morning - superb selection of food.

So will definitely return to stay again... great friendly staff - really enjoyed it!

Thanks to you all at the Camden Court Hotel...",4,2010,05,11
248,"Reasonably Priced, Gr8 Location, but a mediocre room","The hotel is only minutes of walking to city centre, but it was extremely cold because the hotel still uses radiators for heating.  I had the radiator turned up to the max and I could not tell the difference.   I later realized that the temperature for the entire hotel is controlled in a central location.  In addition, the plumbing was very noisy.  Whenever my neighbor would take a shower I would hear a loud screeching sound and thumping (water flowing through archaic pipes).

In addition, it took hours for housekeeping to pick up the room service tray left outside my door (after I called to remind them to pick it up).

There was also FREE internet service that was UNSECURED and very slow.",3,2010,04,30
248,lovely central hotel,"booked this hotel for easer weekend cos it looked nice, was central, had a lesiure centre and was one of the only hotels in dublin with a pool and a parking complex - free. room was lovely, great price on hotels.com , didnt eat in hotel so cant comment on that, bar was really nice and so was pool.",4,2010,04,13
248,Just back,"Stayed here for the Ireland V Scotland rugby

4th trip to Dublin for this event however first time at this hotel.

Great value, service,location etc

Arrived on an early flight and were in hotel by 9.45am. To our delight both rooms were ready and we were permitted to swap our breakfast entitlement for sunday with friday - not many hotels would do this.

After being able to check in, have a cracking full breakfast and a swim and sauna etc we were all set for the day and night ahead.

Overall an excellent time helped by the hotel.

The next fixture will be 2012 - our hotel is already decided !

NB The pub next door is brilliant",4,2010,03,22
248,Another great stay in lovely hotel,"After staying at The Camden Court for two nights around St. Patrick's Day last year, we were able to get far more competitive prices this year, albeit without breakfast. My wife and I were on the top floor, our room was smaller than last year, but spotlessly clean, and it was pretty quiet as we were on the inside overlooking the car park. The rest of our party had no problems, bar one dodgy shower head! The bar is fine, coming in a little cheaper than some city centre pubs . . not cheap for sure, but competitive. A really good hotel, not too far from the centre if you are ok walking, but also on bus routes. We will almost certainly be back.",4,2010,03,20
248,excellent value for money,"stayed here with 3 friends in a triple room as we were heading out to a gig in Tripod.  What can I say, this place was unbelievable value for money.  2 super comfy large double beds and one large single bed in the room.  Lovely fresh duvets, tea area, hairdryer, iron and ironing board.. all for €40 each!  Parking was free and it was literally 2 mins from the club where we were heading.  The rugby was on that wkd and expected it to be a bit noisey but never heard a thing.  Breakfast wasnt included and was a bit on the pricey side €13 for a hot buffet and about €10 for the cold.. We didnt bother with it and just ate in a cafe on Wexford street instead.  Overall I will definitely be staying here again, no hassle trying to get taxis, just left the club and was straight back to the hotel..

Also seemed very secure as there was a doorman to check the names on a list when we were coming back in.

The only one really small thing was that the showers had curtains instead of a glass door.. its just a personal thing really but I dont like curtains!

Hotel is also right beside the usual dublin haunts, coppers, krystle, d2 so excellent for a little party wkd away from the cheese of temple bar.

There is also a leisure centre and I think there is a pool.  I seen a sign for massages but didnt get one myself... think it might have just killed me ;-)

A***************",4,2010,03,18
248,"Overall, it is just OK","In the United States,  for $100 you can find a spacious hotel room with two queen beds, a thermostat and complimentary toiletries.  I learned a long time ago that the same does not hold true in Europe.  Still, I expect some basics like hot water.  Our shower had a sign that said something along the lines of ""please wait two minutes for the water to reach your desired temperature.""  I'm sorry, but even my crappy pre-war apartment in NYC can do better than that.  The water was ice cold and often took longer than two minutes to reach an acceptable temperature.  
Also, the temperature in the room was a problem.  In the evening, it was cold.  In the morning (especially after we showered), it was humid and hot.
The paint on the walls was badly chipped.  I think that if you're going to endeavor to paint your walls red, you should make sure that it always looks fresh.  Otherwise, keep them white or beige.  
The location of the hotel was pretty good, we were able to walk to a lot, and many of the city's buses stopped across the street or down the block.  There are plenty of convenience stores and pubs within walking distance--the proximity to the Bleeding Horse was a definate plus.  
The staff was also friendly and helpful.  My husband's bag was delayed and did not arrive when the airline said it would (surprise surprise).  We had problems contacting the airline via my prepaid international cell phone, so my husband went downstairs to talk to reception.  They were kind enough to allow him to call the airline using their phone at no charge, even though it was an international call.  They were also very willing to help--we asked for an inexpensive place where my husband could pick up some basics in case his luggage was delayed further, and they literally sent us to the cheapest clothing place imaginable (Penney's).  
We did have a problem with the staff--the night before we left, we asked them to order a cab to pick us up for the airport at 8:30 am.  At 8:45, we went downstairs because the cab had not yet arrived.  We learned that a cab was never ordered or they had us down for 9:30 (it wasn't clear from the conversation which it was).  Still, they ordered a cab for us and asked them to come right away.  We did not have to wait more than 10 minutes for the new cab (unless you count the 15 we were initially waiting).  
Other reviewers complained about breakfast being expensive--it was free for us (included in our rate).  We were able to have breakfast delivered to our room for only 2.75 euro/pp.  I also did not experience the same problem that other reviewers had regarding wifi.",3,2010,03,16
248,A great first impression for a first time visit to Dublin.,"Just finished a wonderful stay at your property.  I cannot say enough
about the helpful, wonderful hotel staff.  Everyone went out of their
way to help us with any questions, directions or money exchanges we
needed.  The room was clean and there was plenty of space for the two of
us.  The location is a great one for first-time visitors to Dublin and I
will stay there on my next trip to that beautiful city.  Thank you for
the amazing Irish hospitality.",5,2010,03,15
248,Great location & facilities.,"I had a room overlooking the car park at the back ad had the best nights sleep ever - it was so quiet. The rooms are well equipped and clean.

The pool, steam room, sauna and jacuzzi were a bonus - so too was the parking.

The staff were very friendly and helpful and there was a nice lobby area to sit in too.

The location is amazing - and only a minutes walk from Harcourt Luas stop.",4,2010,03,07
248,Very good,"Stayed there 3 weeks ago for one night fri/sat. Great location. Clean big room nice bathroom, very warm during the night.staff was very helpfull.breakfast was nice Irish standard fry also a selection of continental treats reasonably priced too.",5,2010,02,22
248,"Great food, location and value.","I stayed in this hotel over the weekend with my family. The location is super, less than 5 minutes walk from St. Stephens Green and the LUAS is right outside the door. The hotel is clean, large rooms and has good leisure facilities with a large pool for a city centre hotel. Free onsite car parking for all hotel residents. What I was pleasantly surprised with was the restaurant. The food was great, not your typical standard hotel food, both in the menu choice and quality of the food. The service was really high end and the price was very attractive. I will be staying here again.",5,2010,02,22
248,not great   !!!!!,"We have traveled alot on mini breaks throughout ireland.  This hotel is a stag party venue , 
We were there on a monday night and i had asked for a quiet room as we have small children. there was a jack hammer going on till 10 o clock outside our window.
The rooms were not great , on the plus side they were big . but there was blood on the wall as u come in the door . the toilet didnt flush properly and one of the headboards were not connected to the bed. the electricity had a mind of its own.  There was no wi -fi available in our room.
The staff were mainly eastern european , they were unfriendly and unhelpful.
For instance , they would clean the tables by brushing the crumbs with there hand.  There was broken glass on the floor in the resturant for a full 24 hours and asked several times, on two different days for it to be removed.. We had to ask for things several times and found the staff almost robotic . 
Times are tough and money is tight , i wont be wasting any more of my money on this poor excuse for a hotel.
the cead mile failte is indeed missing in the camden court.",2,2010,02,16
248,"""A stones throw from St.Stephens Green""","We arrived on Friday 12th. 2nd entrance on the right brought us to the hotels underground parking.What a God send!! You then enter the hotel via the basement.Our check in was smooth and very fast.We were allocated room 329.Room was of average size,with a generous size bathroom.Iron,ironing board,hair dryer,kettle provided.I personally thought they could have provided us with more milk,sugar etc.Not so good if you are a big tea drinker!! Our view was overlooking the back of the hotel,which maybe saved on noise. 

Through our 2 night stay I discovered that the rooms are not sound proof and the door in the corridor outside our room(which lead to the lift) was a complete nuisance.The noise of it opening and closing first thing in the morning lead me to distraction!!

St.Stephens Green is a 5min walk, you really could not ask for a better location! Temple bar is a 10 min walk,but even quicker if you hire a city bike for €2 for 3days,with a €150 credit card deposit. A fantastic way to see the city!!

We took advantage of the leisure facilities the gym was well equipped and the pool area was first class.

We did not eat in the hotel, but would highly recommend Yum Yums and Rhubarb, two little cafes on Lower Camden Street just beside the Camden Court.

Overall our stay at the Camden Court Hotel was a pleasure.Staff are very friendly and are a credit to the hotel.Thank you for a memorable stay.",5,2010,02,16
248,"Excellent location, clean, friendly staff, would stay again","Myself and 3 friends booked this hotel through Tripadvisor. The hotel is lovely - very clean and spacious and the staff are friendly and welcoming. We had two twin rooms, both clean and quiet our rooms overlooked a car park at the back so there was little noise. 

The hotel is on a street  which is 2 streets parallel to Grafton St (the main shopping street). We didn't have breakfast but we found a place about 5 mins walk from the hotel called 'Yum Yums' - full breakfast plus tea for €7 - bargain prices!!! It is just as you come out the hotel, turn right down the main street. 

We ended up going to a few bars - one called Feile also on the same street as the hotel - cosy pub, lovely atmosphere and steaks for €12.99. Flannerys' is a great Irish pub - may need to queue if you go there on a Saturday night!!

Overall thought the hotel and location was excellent!!",4,2010,02,11
248,Great location + Great price = great stay!,"I stayed here for the 6 nights I was in Dublin and I must say it was a great place.  My friend has been staying at this hotel for the last 5 years and loves it so this time I decided to go with him to have some fun in Dublin and we stayed here.

I am use to staying at 5-star type hotels and as we all know Europe doesn't have many ""5-star"" hotels for good prices like we do in the USA.  I travel abroad once to twice a year so I am use to the hotels in Europe and I must say that this one is very nice and the breakfast is great!

One thing to note is that if you need to use the pool you have to have a ""cap"" and you can buy one there for 1.5 Euro.  There is a great bar downstairs and as I said the breakfast is great, but for the price I would go elsewhere.  The ""Bleeding Horse"" is a great bar next door and on Friday's and Saturday's it gets pretty lively.

If you want to eat the same food at half the cost go to Rhubarb down the street and then for dinner go to Green 19.  They are both right on Camden street almost next to each other.

Back to the hotel...I have added some pictures of our room.  We had two double beds (though you have to request this before hand and confirm before a day or two before to make sure).  The shower was ok...we had a bad shower head that was all but we told them and hopefully they will fix it.  Our room number was 509 (the room was HUGE!!!!)  You could easily fit up to 6+ people in this room comfortably if you needed too.

All-in-all I would stay here again because it was a good location, the staff was very welcoming and helpful, and it was a great price!",4,2009,12,13
248,"Nice hotel, well situated","The Hotel is very well situated at walking distance of the major activities in Dublin. Staff was nice.
It is very handy to have a parking at  disposal since we rented a car. 
I recommend",4,2009,12,11
248,what the story with the pool ???,"Stayed here in early november with my wife nice hotel rooms were nice but wifi in room wouldnt connect Breakfast was nice and the reception staff were very helpful . 
Went to gym on the second day its very small and there was a awful smell in it of dry sweat and the rowing machine was broken. there is 3 tvs with no sound  over the running machines with doesnt make sence ?
The pool was cold its meant  to be heated and it was also very murkey and to round it all off the juccuzi was out of order which i wouldnt have minded if any of the 2 girls had told me 
p.s  i did enjoy the coffee but what was the point in having a coffee after just working out",3,2009,12,11
248,Comfortable modern hotel in the centre of Dublin,"We're just back from a stay at the Camden Court hotel and we had a lovely time. 

We booked online and check-in was fast and efficient. We were on the fifth floor, and the room was spacious and clean. Compared to other hotels we have stayed at, there was a lot of space to move around in which was a welcome change. I was able to access the wifi in my room without any problems. 

We used the pool which was on the chilly side, but the steam room and sauna made up for that. The jacuzzi wasn't working which was a shame, but at least it meant that we didn't spend all day in there! 

What we really liked was the breakfast provided: the food was good, the coffee was above average and the staff were friendly. 

We would recommend this hotel to others and would consider using it again ourselves.",4,2009,11,29
248,Very nice but with some important notes,"I must say, overall I was very pleased with this hotel.  It was in a good location (about 5 minute walk from St. Stephen's Green and Grafton Street).

The lobby is beautiful and the staff were extremely nice.  The rooms were spacious and the bed, pillows and cover were fantastic.  Had nice amenities:  flat screen tv, iron, iron board, hair dryer, plenty of closet/drawer space.

My only issue was that they advertised free wi fi in each room.  Albeit, I showed a ""low"" signal, but was never able to actually access it in my room which is the MAIN reason I booked THIS hotel.  They had IT come and work on it and IT, somehow, said THEY got a good signal in my room.  

I tried taking my netbook to various locations in the room (even into the bathroom) but was still unable to access the internet.  So, I had to either go into the lobby or hallway which was extremely unacceptable as I had planned to access it each night when I turned in and/or first thing in the morning.  

This problem was not mine alone (they even had me try another room to see if I had better luck -- I didn't).  I got EXCELLENT connection in the lobby, so I knew it wasn't the netbook.  Others I knew traveling couldn't access it in their rooms as well.

Each morning, I would go down with my netbook, sit in a corner with a small table and ordered a scone, coffee (very good) and juice.  Sometimes that service was slow, but that was ok as I was going to be there for a while.

(This became an issue once I got an email that my mom had been rushed to the hospital.  Used Skype on computer but had to have public conversation which should have been a private conversation in my room.)

Only other mishap was the wrong 4:30 am wake up call that I didn't request which came just hours after finding out my mom was in the hospital.  Needless to say, it didn't make for a restful night.

Overall, it was extremely clean (except I finally had to put my empty tissue box ON the trash can to get a new one).",4,2009,11,06
248,Excellent value for money,"We use this hotel everytime we visit Dublin and find everything absolutely spot on everytime. It is rated as a three star hotel and thats exactly what it is. The staff are always friendly and professional (the chamber maid helped us open our bedroom door when we couldn't quite get the hang of the swipe card) The rooms are always clean, comfortable and have everything you need including an iron! which so many hotels forget! The bed is so comfy (so much so that i never want to get out of it!) and the breakfast has a great selection from cerals,pastries, cooked breakfast etc. The Location is very central and although i read from a previous review that the area was 'a little run down' It is infact in Dublin 2 (southside Dublin) very close to stephens green which is the opposite of run down..I lived there for nearly 5 years. The facilities are great full use of pool, jacuzzi and gym which is great after a busy day to wind down. On average we pay around 89-99euro for a double room including breakfast which I think is exceptional value...Just back from Venice paid twice that and the hotel wasn't a pick on the Camden.. Forgot to mention free parking was included in the price!! city centre dublin!",4,2009,11,04
248,Nice hotel with pool area,"Walking distance to city center and parcs. Nice breakfast buffet, Nice pool area located in the basement. Pool and fittness center is used also by locals, try to avoid fat ladies water aerobic, it might be a bit overwhelming:-)",4,2009,10,31
248,Enjoyed our stay!,"Camden Court Hotel has many good points - clean rooms, lovely breakfast served until 11 at weekend and 10.30 during the week which meant you don't need to rush to get up, friendly bar area serving good food and comfortable lounge with helpful staff. Tesco express just up the road for wine and nibbles! It is a pleasant 10 minutes walk from St Stephens Green and Grafton Street etc. It had a few points that I disliked (but only niggles) these were no internet access in rooms, noise from pipes at night was annoying and meant I needed earplugs and there was no views from the room.

We visited all of the major attractions but particularly enjoyed Bewleys, the national gallery, walking along the Liffey, the visit to the beach and lighthouse at Howth (only 30 minutes on the DART train), Gaiety theatre and of course copious amounts of Guiness. Pub down the road called ""Feile"" I would recommend. The Bleeding Horse pub next door was fun but didn't fancy the food. Ate in hotel bar and it was very good food.

Didn't have a chance to visit leisure facilities - too much to see and do!

This is a good option for an inner city hotel.",4,2009,10,28
248,fab hotel,"We booked this hotel after reading many reviews, had the best time, room was a good size and had everything needed to see us through a weekend in the city. The pub next door to the hotel was not at all a problem. I thought there may have been some nosie, but we heard nothing. The hotel has a great bar area and is great for a snack before heading out for a drink or two.The swimming pool and steam room were fab after a night out!! The breakfast were expensive at 26 euro per couple, but we eat the next day at a little cafe a walk away towards temple bar for half the price called Yum Yums.",4,2009,10,27
248,Fun and Cheap Trip,"We arrived at the hotel very early in the morning and as expected was not able to check into our rooms, but the hotel staff was very helpful and held our bags as we went sight seeing.  We came back from our sightseeing trip and as promised our rooms were ready.  The room and bathroom were nothing special but was very clean and no frills.  We didn't go into the hotel resturant and bar, but there were a lot of people in them.  The lobby was very spacious and staff was very helpful in giving directions and calling taxis.  Overall the staff was great.  The location of the hotel was about 20 minutes from the center of the city and required that you take the tram and do some walking.  We would defintely stay here again.",4,2009,10,25
248,In need of TLC,"We have just returned from a 3 night stay at the Camden Court in Dublin.
We chose this hotel following a web search and managed to pick up a cheap rate. It is important to us to have a Leisure Club in a hotel so the Camden Court appeared to fit the bill as it is one of the few in the centre of Dublin offering such facilities.
We were a little disappointed in the hotel. The reception area is very presentable and the Leisure facilites are adequate (although the showers are very dirty and the toilets smelly). There is a strict rule at the hotel that all users of the pool MUST wear a swimming hat for hygiene reasons. Our 5 year old son became very stressed by this so was permitted to wear the shower cap from the room instead. (certain restrictions for pool use apply due to Water Aerobics classes - so worth checking out). The Sauna and steam room were large as was the jacuzzi - although this was out of action for some of our stay.
The hotel really lets the standard slip in the bedrooms though. Again, your first impression is of a large chunk out of the room door where it has had a hammering from several years worth of suitcases. The room was large (1 double and 2 single beds) but the lighting was very gloomy. The carpet was in need of replacing or, at least, a good clean as it was quite marked. The bathroom had sufficient towels (although a little ragged) and an adequate supply of toiletries. It was clean enough but there was a sizeable hole in the wall above the toilet flush and a strange smell sometimes came up through the plughole in the wash hand basin. There was clearly a problem with an airlock  somewhere in the pipeline as we heard them banging loudly several times during our stay. The beds themselves were clean and very comfortable and the room was warm once the heating came on in the evening. It is worth asking for a high room away from the traffic of what is a very busy corner. The situation of the hotel is not as good as I had expected - the area is a little run down.
For those of you who are travelling in / out from Dublin airport  we would highly recommend the 16A bus service from outside the airport terminal. It cost us just over 5euro in total for 2 adults and a child, compared to approx 40euro by taxi (slightly less by AirCoach we think, but still not as cheap as the local bus service). The local 16A bus stops just yards from the hotel outside the Tesco Express and returns to the airport on the opposite side of the road. Allow 1 hour for the journey though.
Our stay at Camden Court did not include breakfast. We had received a recommendation to visit the famous Bewleys cafe for breakfast which we did. This is vastly over-rated as the food was cold and the prices expensive. However, we found a great little cafe called Rhubarb, just around the corner from the hotel in Lower Pembroke Street. It was very reasonable and offered a first class breakfast for a little over half the cost of Bewleys.
During our brief stay in Dublin we visited the Guinness Storehouse which was, again, pricey and not terribly exciting. We also took our wee boy on the LUAS tram to Stillorgan to Imaginosity. This is a 'hands on' childrens science centre. Our son is 5 years old and thoroughly enjoyed his visit there. The website states that you buy a ticket for a specified day/timeslot. However, this only seems to apply at weekends and school holidays. Worth a visit - but why is it not closer to the centre of town?!
To sum-up, we will not be returning to Dublin. Too expensive, too much Guinness and far too much dog-dirt!!",3,2009,10,25
248,"Clean, simple and well located","We stayed here fro three nights for a city break to dublin. The price was OK, they hotel was clean and comfortable. It was not amazing but was definitley of a good standard. The location was excellent for me. Near enough to walk to the main areas, temple bar etc, but far enough away to be a bit more peaceful. The Camden Road area had some great restuarants and bars itself. The buses to the airport (16a) and to get around go from just around the corner. All in all if you can get a resonable price then this is ideal.",4,2009,10,21
248,Great short stay,I was just passing through Dublin on my way to a walking tour in Kerry.  The room was large and clean and quiet.  It's next door to an old pub where I had a great beef and Guiness stew.  I can recommend the hotel.,4,2009,10,06
248,Good Value Hotel in handy location,"I have stayed quite a few times in the Camden Court Hotel as it is in an ideal location in Dublin and has a free underground Car Park. For a 3* Hotel the facilities are pretty good, the Lobby and Bar Area are excellent and the rooms are a little small but clean and comfortable.",4,2009,10,02
248,not as good as expected,"I had booked this hotel for my my husband's birthday, as we had been here some years before, with good memories.   I felt the overall cleanliness and appearance upstairs in the hotel had decreased eg paint off the walls behind the bed, black marks on the walls which should have been removed, large piece of dust which i passed for 3 days on a corridor carpet.  Downstairs, however, the hotel lobby was very nice and the leisure facilities were very clean, quiet and relaxing.

We were on a room only basis as we felt we wanted to experience food around the city.  When we booked in, at approx 1am, as arranged, I felt quite uncomfortable as the manager asked for a credit card.  I explained that i had only a bank card and cash with me.  The bank card was not acceptable to him apparantly, and i was fortunate to have the necessary 385 euros (balance) approx in cash, or i don't know what would have happened at that time in the morning.  

Although I was more than willing to pay almost 100 euro per night to stay here prior to my stay, I do not think we received value for money this time around, after seeing some of the other hotels and prices around the city and having stayed at other 3/4 star hotels in the uk and ireland.",3,2009,09,28
248,Nothing special about this hotel,"I stayed here for 3 nights recently on a business trip as it was recommended by a friend. The lobby was lovely and there was always a nice atmosphere there. The bar was nice, but food just O.K. I'd only eat here if I had to, nothing special on the menu and typical bar food menu. The staff all round were o.k but not very friendly, especially in the bar. The odd smile wouldn't go astray here! The rooms were definately not of a 4 star standard and probably the most basic of all 4 star hotels I've stayed in. Not even a safe in the rooms, so please be careful if you have valuble items with you. I had to ask for an iron and ironing board and when it arrived, the ironing board collapsed, but only a minor thing I suppose. The one thing that did annoy me was that I asked for a quiet room as I needed to wake early every morning but they put me over the area at the back of the hotel where taxis drop off. Needless to say, it was quiet noisy. The hotel location was central enough but I think I'd rather stay somewhere else next time. I expected an awful lot more for €100 a night.",2,2009,09,27
248,no frills - good location,"I stayed at this hotel for one night with friends in mid September. Purpose of our stay was leisure. Hotel is located on Camden Street which is very central for those wishing to go shopping/sight seeing or clubing!..Hotel lobby is nice, check in was professional and efficient. However, I was given a single room instead of a twin room. Single room was small..walls were dirty and were in need of a coat of paint. The wall behind the headboard was damaged..  bit too much movement i guess!!. Skirting boards were also stained and dirty. Worst part was the over whelming smell of urine outside the bathroom!!
I left the room and reception staff had no problem changing my room to a twin. This room was a lot bigger and fresh, couldnt fault it. Beware of traffic outisde hotel it will wake you quiet early
Bar was nice and modern if not a little quiet.
Did not try food on advice of friends who had stayed at hotel before
leisure centre was nice, but as its in the basement its depressing with no natural light.
Overall its a hotel I would recommend for its location and solely for just sleeping for a night with no frills!",3,2009,09,19
248,"Reasonable value, noisy room",First time I've stayed at The Camden Court. Was there for two nights in August. Hotel staff were friendly and efficient. The room was of a reasonable standard though too noisy at night - mostly traffic noise as we were located at the front of the hotel. The location of the hotel is good as you're just a short walk from Stephens Green.,4,2009,09,14
248,rude manager,"This is my first night at the hotel and I'm booked for  two more nights. The level of customer service here is extremely disappointing. We were not told that we could not bring a guest in after midnight so when we wanted to bring a friend up for coffee at 1230 we were so rudely stopped by the doorman and hotel manager. As I did not know about the existence of the policy I questioned the manager very politely about if it was possible for our guest to leave id and leave in half an hour so we dont have to turn out guest away. She, ciara or chiara, said it was hotel policy that there can be no non residents after midnight. I respect the policy of course but the attitude with which she was talking to us was unbearable. Her exact words were ""you are wasting my time. It's been ten minutes."" She also said ""i'm the hotel manager it's my rules."" I told her, can I quote you on this? I added that I understand that this is hotel policy but I do not understand the tone with which she was talking to us, why could she not have been more professional in explaning this rule? Could she not have apologized for not having explained the rule to us when we checked in so we would not have been embarassed by having to turn out guest away? I told her the policy I can understand but this tone is unacceptable, in response she lifted her name tag and said ""this is my name."" I  told her I don't want to argue but it is my first time in ireland and I was not expecting this policy which should hav e been told to me upon check-in but she kept interrupting me. I had to ask her, ""would you please let me finish my sentence? We wouldn't be wasting time if I didn't keep getting interrupting."" When my friend tried to ask if only two people was allowed in the room, the doorman pointed his hand at him and said, see what he's doing, he's trying to argue. At no time were we loud or rowdy, we were simply asking about a policy that we do not know about and yet we were treated like criminals. At the room I checked the guest information folder and nowhere is this policy stated. 

The location is good but something has to be done about the service. No non-residents after midnight is not an issue but not telling us about it beforehand is. Not explaning the policy to us is an even bigger issue.As for wasting her time, we walked out friend out to the road and when we came back she was smoking and chatting with the doorrmen. Could she not have the patience to explain the policy to us rather than to be so curt so she has time to smoke?",2,2009,09,07
248,"Hotel is nice, location is decent",If you want to stay at a nicer hotel near the city center it is good for that.  Rooms are okay.  Lobby is nice along with pool.  I rate it low since I am not a city person and the rooms were not what I expected.,3,2009,09,04
248,would definitely come back,"Great reception service, very clean.  Breakfast was excellent.",4,2009,08,31
248,"Great location, good value although not great customer service","We stayed at the hotel this weekend as we were going to the Gaiety Theatre to watch one of the last performances of Riverdance.  The hotel is in a good location situated south of the river.  We were told to get the 16a bus by the airport which drops you round the corner and goes every 20 minutes.  A note - getting the bus is only €2.20 for a single fare and there is a ticket machine outside the airport which takes notes and coins.  We got a taxi back due to the early departure which on a Sunday cost us €36!!
Anyway upon arriving at the hotel we were very early but were allowed to check in at 11am and the reception staff were efficient and friendly.  Our room was on the 6th floor and was adequate and clean with a nice comfy bed.  Shower was nice and you get the usual complimentary toiletries.  Tea and coffee provided as well as an iron, ironing board and hairdryer.
We were really keen to use the swimming pool until we read in the info book in our room that all guests MUST wear swimming hats!!!!!!  This was for ""hygiene"" reasons.  We obviously don't carry hats with us and we were advised we could purchase 2 hats at a cost of €2 each.  Frankly this is ridiculous!!  We only booked into the hotel to use the pool and simply could not be bothered to wear the hats.  We travel extensively and never have we come across this before.
We ate in the Central restaurant in the evening.  I had the lamb and chorizo burger which was just over £10 and was lovely.  My partner had the lemon peppered chicken which was £12 and was very disappointing for the cost.  It tasted fine if a little dry but was identical to a chicken fillet burger from KFC!!  A vodka and coke was €7!!!  oops.
In the morning we had to have an early check out and had a taxi ordered at half 7.  The breakfast place opens at 7.  We were allowed in a couple of minutes before and there were a few other people arriving.  The first impression of the restaurant is that it is spacious, clean and well set out.  However, it was impossible to find the tea and coffee as there was no proper area set out for it.  I had to ask where it was and was pointed to a tray filled with tea and coffee pots which I thought had been left the night before!  The chef (who serves you a hot breakfast) barely spoke english and my fiance gave up trying to ask for a fried egg (even though this is available) and ended up with scrambled egg which was like rubber and tastless.  The food to be honest was okay but nothing special and for the money you would expect more.  You also get all the cereals, fruit and toast etc etc.  All in all the hotel was good value but we just feel they should focus more on customer service.  We would stay there again but would not eat there as the restaurants are overpriced and the chef (s) are not great.  Sorry chefs!!",4,2009,08,23
248,Cheap & cheerful.,"We booked this hotel via lastminute.com and were very pleased with what we got for our money.  Nice, clean rooms with big beds, very helpful staff and the bar prices weren't too bad for Dublin.  It is a little bit out of town but my girlfriend and I enjoyed walking into the city centre through the little side streets.  We found some great places to eat & drink. Good Irish style pub next to hotel called The Bleeding Horse, great music & open late 3am I think.  You can even pull your own pint of Guinness at your table!
Overall I would recommended this hotel for a weekend stay.  There is also a bus service to the airport about 2 mins walk from the hotel, very handy & much cheaper (€2 each) than a taxi (€40).",4,2009,08,23
248,dissapointing,"just back from 2 days in this hotel.I was very dissapointed ,the rooms are ok but small and plain also, the windows on the bottom floor dont open out,so the room was very warm and stuffy.I asked for a room change and i was given one by a lovely girl at reception, so customer service was good. . .It was noisy also  but then the hotel is in a busy area.The pool and jaquizzi were lovely just check that there are no classes going on because when i went down on the thursday  evening there was an aqua areobics class going on so i could not use the pool.Stay in this hotel if you are just on a sightseeing tour of dublin but not if you are seeking a bit  of  comfort or to relax.",2,2009,08,16
248,Excellant Hotel - you cant go wrong!!,"We have just come back from a 3 night stay at this hotel and can say nothing negative about it. Check In was good. Rooms are good with everything you need. They have a lovely pool and jacuzzi and breakfast was good. The bar lounge is really nice, not as pricey as the other bars around. Can think of any reason why this isnt a 4 star hotel. Ideally located for seeing the sites, with the hopper bus stops pretty close. The street it is on has some really good bars with music and entertainment if you dont want to travel into the centre. Warning....it is really expensive in Dublin, with prices in temple bar being the most expensive and go up when it gets late!!! Our most expensive round was 27.60 euros!!! taxi to the hotel from the airport was about 34.00 euros.

Overall brilliant hotel and would recommend to anyone - any questions, please ask!!!

Happy Holidays!!",5,2009,08,16
248,lovely hotel,"hotel is really nice, the staff are really helpful and although the food and drink is pricey (althought so is all of dublin) it is a good place to eat and drink as well. we never ate in the restaurant but it looks quite nice although slightly quiet. the staff were so friendly they let us use the pool even after we had checed out on the day we were due to leave. only thing i would say would be that the bathroom had a bit of a funny damp smell we were in room 404 but others may be different. i would choose this hotel again if i were to return to dublin for value and for location as it is about 15 minute walk to the centre and only about 5 to 10 mins to st stephens green and grafton street,",4,2009,08,04
248,Good home base,"Camden Court Hotel served as our family's home away from home for three days during our Dublin stay.  The room was spacious and accommodated our family of four nicely.  This hotel was one of the only ones offering such.  Conveniently located to most key highlights, those not handy were within walking distance.  Room amenities included in-room coffee and most standard toiletries.  Missing was WiFi and, a pet peeve of mine, no wash clothes.  The ice machine was located one floor away while the soft drink machine just outside.  On the whole, we enjoyed our stay and the hotel staff was courteous and helpful.",4,2009,08,02
248,Decent Value,"Rooms are basic, plumbing could be better, the staff is attentive and friendly.  Beds were hard, but I find that very common in European Hotels.  The hotel is a reasonably walk to St. Stephen's Green and the city center.  The Bleeding Horse pub next door is a good choice for dinner and a beer.",3,2009,07,28
248,Good value,"We stayed in the Camden Court hotel for ashort visit to Dublin.  We found excellent effecient staff, comfortable hotel a great swimming pool and excellent food.",4,2009,07,25
248,GLAD WE ONLY STAYED ONE NIGHT,"This hotel is where we ended our bus tour of Ireland and I'm glad we only stayed here the one night. The lobby and common areas of this hotel are quite attractive however the rooms were not. They are tired and sparsely furnished rooms. The front desk was not sufficiently covered so that all inquiries could be fielded. In terms of location there are plenty of hotels in Dublin that are far more convenient to the main attractions in Dublin (e.g. O'Callaghan's Davenport).

On a positive note the breakfast buffet was really quite good.",3,2009,07,24
248,"great value, fantastic location","not sure what the other reviews were on about, in terms of a/c--we stayed for 3 nights in mid july and the temps were average--we never needed a/c, in fact, the heater came on two of the three nights!  if noise is a concern, ask for a higher floor, rear facing.  all three nights we had wonderful sleeps, and the hotel is fabulously located.  we were within comfortable walking distance to tons of sights--stephen's green, grafton st, temple bar, trinity college, the guinness storehouse, o'connell/parnell st, iveagh gardens, etc.  not to mention, the bleeding horse pub below is the oldest in dublin, and there's a good trad session a block away at devitt's. . .after having driven all around ireland, it was a pleasure being within walking distance to all of the sights we were interested in, in dublin.",4,2009,07,23
248,"central location, shabby rooms","If you don't really care much for the extras and just need somewhere to sleep for the night, this is a great hotel. It is in a central part of Dublin so it is very easy to walk places from there. We drove into Dublin and didn't use our car again until we left. The convenient underground parking that is included is a great plus as well. We stayed for 3 nights but only woke up in time for breakfast once. It was the standard irish breakfast fare- greasy, fried and heavy. The rooms are definitely in need of updating, but considering how expensive other hotels in Dublin are and if you aren't planning on spending that much time at the hotel, this is a good deal. Although the rooms appear old with gross carpeting, the sheets seemed to be clean and new. Its very easy to go out sightseeing from this very central location which is the whole reason we were there!",3,2009,07,23
248,Rooms need improving,"Stayed in this hotel for one night for a trip to Dublin. My BFriend got us an upgrade to a suite - SHOULD'NT HAVE BOTHERED. The ""Suite"" was awful - no bedsidelockers, stains on the walls, a basic bathroom, no full lenght mirror, furnishing that belonged in the 1970s. Really disappointing. Breakfast was o.k, pool is also quite in need of a bit of a refurb. All in all the hotel is in the middle of the city so you don't spend much time in the room anyway, just dont go for a suite.",3,2009,07,16
248,"Fantastic!!!""","First time away with my boyfriend, we decided to give Dublin a go and after much researching decided to book the Camden Court and so glad we did.
We arrived tired after a late evening train journey down from the North, in the hotel about 9pm, staff were friendly and helpful. 
The rooms were basic but clean and very tidy, fresh towels everyday, made up beds. Room service all through the night. Only thing was no air conditioning in the room so that was a bit warm but nevertheless it didnt spoil our stay. 
We were only a Bed only deal, so we had our breakfast at one of the cafes across the road (recommend O'Briens).

5 minute walk from Grafton Street and St Stephens Green, not too far from Temple Bar area either, so you are pretty close to the city centre without being right in the noise and busyness. Would suggest you take a horse and cart tour round Dublin, will take you round all the sites (40 euro for 30 mins, 60 euro for 1 hr) and give you the history.

There is a Sauna, Steamroom, Jacuzzi and Pool, all fantastic-and free to hotel users (you will need to purchase a swimming hat though)

The hotel bar Central C was a calm and relaxing place, it never got too noisy. We ate in the Iveagh Restaurant one night, the food was slightly expensive but worth every penny.

Overall-cannot fault this Hotel at all or Dublin in general. Just watch out for the taxi 
drivers, they may con you (was charged just over 11 euro from Connolly Station to the Hotel-we gave the driver 15 euro, expecting some change as we only had notes at that stage. He drove off and we didnt get any change, after that we started giving exact money...",5,2009,07,14
248,"V nice, v central, friendly service, great beauty room","Stayed here last Thursday  for a conference. V handy as so central to the city centre. Lots of nice city walks beside it - a stroll to the Iveagh Gardens, and a couple of minutes walk to Stephen's Green.

Staff were very friendly and helpful. There is a really nice atmosphere in the hotel and you get the impression that it is a lovely place to work.
Rooms were nice - Plasma Screen TV, v comfortable beds.  

Food in the restaurant is v tasty  - and the bar is lively. Also, there is a very famous bar around the corner, called the Bleedin Horse - just outside the hotel

As I was going on a night out, I decided to chill out for a few hours, and had a swim and  a steam in the pool (Bring a swimming cap for the pool). After this, I headed into the beauty room. This is decorated in an Asian style with flowing fabric on the ceiling, with candles, incense, and lovely music. I can honestly say that I had the best massage and  facial ever. My eyebrows were included with the facial, and I walked out feeling really relaxed and ready for the night ahead in Dublin City.

I would definitely stay here again - a great base for exploring the city. I would go back for the facial alone.",5,2009,07,14
248,Enjoyable stay,"We arrived around noon after a long flight from Australia and were pleased to find that our  room was ready for us so we  could shower and sleep. The staff were friendly, happy to help  and good with information and directions. The breakfast was good and we appreciated the free car parking.  We liked the free internet and it worked without any problems for us.   

This hotel is a little out of the busy part of town and that is one of the reasons we decided to stay there - it was a bit quieter and traffic is less than in the centre of Dublin.    We didn't have any problems with noise or the light, which we found very unusual to be still daylight at 11pm, however we managed to sleep without any problems.   

We were warm and airconditioning would have been nice, and the open window didn't quite do the trick - a minor thing and we stayed at many other places in Ireland that also didn't have airconditioning.  

Overall, a pleasant way to start our holiday in Ireland.",4,2009,07,09
248,Better hotels nearby,"Came for a conference, should have flown back the same day. Wifi did not work in the conference area, phone did not work in the room. Reception staff could not give accurate directions to a nearby pub. Not impressed at all.",2,2009,06,30
248,Nice but no air con,"This is a lovely hotel near St. Stephens green. The room has a safe, iron and tea\coffee making facilities.  There was no fridge and air con.  The room was unbearably hot thanks to the great weather.  If you are a light sleeper keeping the window open is not an option with a busy pub next door.
We didn't pay the €13 per person for breakfast. There are a couple of cafe's on Camden street where you can eat a cooked breakfast for €5.",3,2009,06,29
248,nice hotel Bit of a walk to centre of city,"I stayed here with my boyfriend for our birthdays at the start of june, lovely hotel, a bit far of a walk down a dodgy street to get to it though. I would advise vistors to take a left outside the hotel and then the next right to get into the centre of city as its a better lit street. 
the hotel itself is ok but rooms could do with a paint job and maybe new carpets. But nicer than most hotels bathroom wise. 
I had a few drinks in the bar the night we stayed it had a relaxed atmosphere and not to pricey for dublin. 
I would recommend paying the extra €2 someting to have your breakfast in bed I did the breakfast was lovely and plentiful and better that we didn';t have to get dressed to go the restaurant for it. :) 
overall nice hotel but not one for walking in high heels to the bars.",3,2009,06,21
248,clean and convenient but noisey,"Convenient walk to Grafton St and Trinity College area.  longer walk to Temple Bar but still convenient.  Our room for 3 was a very good size for 3 people.  However, it was a very warm weekend and we were on the sunset side of the building so it stayed very bright til 11PM and very warm all night.  No a/c.  Also no top sheet so the choice was cover with the too warm duvet or no cover at all.  So beware in summer or if just landed and have jet lag.    Also because we needed to keep the windows wide open all night when the bar next door let out at about 2 AM or later each night it was very noisey for a long while.  People shouting to each other as if no one else existed in the city.",3,2009,06,20
248,Convenient location...but only an OK stay.,"Hotel Camden Court is a pleasant enough hotel in a good location being only a 15 minute walk from such attractions as Dublin Castle and Temple Bar.

There is free wireless available at a good speed and a fitness centre with a pool, which is good and the bathrooms in the hotel rooms are pretty nice. This is probably where the good points end, at least in regards to our short stay.

Our room was spacious enough however it's fairly old but moderately clean. There were not enough power points around which was frustrating when trying to use a laptop, hair straightener, camera charger etc.

Our room was located right next to the maids room on the 3rd floor (room 327). We were woken up early each morning with loud talking, banging and crashing etc - you can hear anything that goes on outside your door, anything at all. So much for a relaxing sleep-in.

To use the pool you need to buy a swimming cap for some stupid reason - stupid considering half the people who wear them still have hair flowing out of the bottom. Totally not worth it - but the pool/sauna/spa was quite nice.

There was a plasma TV in the room with fairly good television and quite a few channels which is always a plus but overall I think I would look elsewhere next time - even if it was just due to a one off bad experience.",3,2009,06,17
248,"Great location, Adequate Room, Nice Pool and Jacuzzi","Stayed here for 89 B&B, all Dublin hotels appear pricey apart from the Bewley's deal. Chose this hotel as it had free parking which I needed and it was within walking distance of a business meeting. Room was bog standard. Restaurant does not have much soul, breakfast full of American's on package deal. Loved the pool, and super strength jacuzzi and nice sauna. I would stay here again as its easy to drive to and the price is OK and it has a good fitness centre and pool although the value would be better as part of a DBB package. NB for parking you drive past front of hotel weeping right then stop in front pf very larg green gates, press buzzer for admittance if shut, then down right, turn right, till you see small boom arm gate, leading to hotel parking area. You enter beneath hotel at the leisure centre entrance.",4,2009,06,08
248,Decent Hotel Mediocre Breakfast,"Front desk staff were all friendly and helpful, they let us leave suitcases there for a week while we toured around Ireland. Dining room staff were a little less cheerful but that may have been partly a reflection of me being tired in the AM. We stayed 4 nights in total. Rooms were sparse but nice, LCD tv was a nice touch (although I suppose that is common now). Breakfast buffet was okay but not nearly as good as a fresh breakfast we had at B&Bs elsewhere, and better can be found in Dublin for less money. Location was pretty central, I chose it largely based on the proximity to St. Stephen's Green. It was just far enough from the stuff we were going to see that it was a bit of a walk though. Jury's Inn Christ Church would have been a bit better for us but then it depends on what you want to see.  I would stay again but would not opt for breakfast unless pressed for time in the morning. We book 3 nights on Travelocity, and 1 night direct. The direct night was well worth it for the Queen sized bed. (We are both tall)",4,2009,05,26
248,Would Recommend This Hotel,"My husband and I have just returned from a 4-night weekend stay at the Camden Court Hotel. We booked for room only. We arrived at Dublin Aiport and caught the 16A right outside Arrivals. E2.40 each to the hotel. There are ticket machines right by the bus-stop so you can purchase your ticket from there. Tickets are valid for 90minutes from the time you get on the bus and they are stamped. The journey was nearly 90minutes but it was approaching rush-hour. The bus stops on Camden Street outside Tesco Express. The hotel is about 30 yards round the corner. The reception desk was helpful and all we needed was our surname. We didn't have to show any paperwork. We'd requested a room on a higher floor and were given a room on the 6th floor, at the top. We had a double room. The room was clean and very quiet. We could not hear the road, traffic or people. The view was not great as we were overlooking offices, but we didn't expect a view from a hotel in a built up city area. The room was very warm. The heating did not come on whilst we were there, so it must just have been heat travelling up from other floors. We kept the window ajar all the time. The tea/coffee/milk was refilled daily. The bathroom toiletries included soaps, shower caps, shampoo and bath/shower gel. These were replaced daily. We didn't have breakfast. But this would have been  E13 per person. We did have one evening meal in C Central bar which is in the hotel. The meals were between E11 - 15 but were lovely. Would recommend the Spicy Chicken Burger  with salad and chips. Very Filling. Pint of Guiness E4.80 from the bar. We often walked out the back entrance of the hotel and down that road. This takes you to the LUAS Tram stop on Harcourt Street. Turning left onto Harcourt Street takes you up to Stephens Green (Shopping Plaza on the left and park on the right.) This was only a 5 minute walk. Another 5 mins brings you to Grafton Street. We would recommend Bewleys on Grafton Street for breakfast (11 euros for Irish Breakfast, 6 Euros for Bacon & Egg Bagel - lovely.) Another 10minutes brings you to O'Connell street. So although the hotel is not right in the city centre it is easy to walk to the main area. We also walked to the Castle - 20 minutes and to the Busaras (Main Bus Station) in 25 minutes. Temple Bar is a 15 minute walk away. So the hotel is central to most places by foot. You can also walk to the Guiness Factory but we opted to catch the 123 from O'Connell Street. E1.20. The driver will tell you where to get off. The cost of eatting out is expensive compared to UK, especially when at the moment the Euro and the Pound are almost equal . Even ""McDonalds"" is double the price. A bottle of wine in Tesco costs E10 - 12  where in England is £5.00. If you go when you get more Euros to the Pound it will be better.
We used the hotel swimming pool facilities. If you intend to swim you need to wear a swim cap. You can purchase one for E2.50. But you only need it for the pool, not the jacuzzi or steam/sauna rooms. It was never busy when we went. Only a few people in there. Towels are provided. We didn't use the gym. 
The bus stop back to the airport is right opposite where you get off on the way there. The bus comes every 20 minutes. The journey took 60 minutes on way back. Allow plenty of time for check-in as the security for departures at Dublin airport is very thorough and takes a while to get through.  
We would recommend this hotel.We did find it quiet but we were high up. If you are a light sleeper and the noise from the road/traffic/people may keep you awake. Try and request a room high up.",5,2009,05,20
248,Great hotel in Dublin 2.,"The Camden Court hotel opened in 1998 and is rated a 3-star.  It is reasonably priced for Dublin at €79-€99 if you book 14 days in advance at the hotel web site, less than 14 days, add about €20, excluding breakfast and it may also be booked through various travel web sites.  Since my last visit in October 2008, the hotel added free in-room wireless internet, which used to run €15 a day.  The hotel has a really nice gym and indoor pool which is unusual for a 3 star.    

The bedrooms are spacious and comfortable featuring a flat screen TV, tea/coffee service, free WiFi, iron and ironing board, laundry & dry cleaning, hairdryer (in the top drawer of the credenza), plenty of closet space and room service.    I thought the bed was a little firm but slept well nonetheless.  Room faced the street and traffic was not noticeable.  

The staff are courteous, efficient and helpful.    

Bathroom was clean with a shower-in-tub and has adequate counter space and a large mirror.   

The Camden is centrally located with lots of restaurants, cafes, bars and markets close by and is a five minute walk to Grafton St., as a point of reference.  A Starbucks is a short distance away on Harcourt St.  And a couple of nice breakfast places can be found on Montague St, between Camden St and Stephen's Green West.  Cafe Bliss is one and offers reasonably priced good fare.  To find Montague St from the Camden Court, exit onto Camden St and head North, towards the centre of town and turn right at the grocery/cafe called ""Fresh"".  

""Fresh"" is a market offering a good deli, groceries, fresh produce, wine & beer etc.  Also, a French cafe called ""La Boulangerie"" is located across Camden St from the hotel and offers wonderful french pastries and all day dining.  

To get to the hotel from DUB take the Aircoach to the Kildare St stop for €8 p/p and the hotel is about a 15-20 minute walk.  A taxi from the airport to the hotel runs about €30.  

I have no problem recommending the Camden Court hotel for travelers who enjoy a 3 1/2 star experience, appreciate free WiFi and like to jump on the treadmill to keep the travel calories at bay!",5,2009,04,25
248,Amazing Hotel!!,"My boyfriend took me here for my Birthday in March for 3 nights.  The hotel is absolutley amazing.  I loved every minute of my stay.  We arrived at the hotel at 9.00 a.m and the room was not ready, but we were able to stay in the hotel reception until our room was ready.  The staff could not do enough for us. 
Once in our room it was absolutley beautiful.  We had a big balcony, although it was raining so we did not use it much.  Waiting for me in the room was a big bouquet of roses, bottle of champgne and a box of choclates!!
We had full use of the gym and swimming pool and also breakfast in the morning, which was full of variety.  There was also a bar attached to the hotel, which is a little pricy for drinks but ok.  
The hotel is about a 5 minute walk from the centre and I would recomend this hotel to anyone.  The hotel in all was fabulous and the staff could not do enough for you.",5,2009,04,23
248,"Excellent hotel, friendly service, great breakfast","Just returned from a 2 night stay with friends.  We were all impressed with the hotel. Great location too.  The hotel was very clean, room were good size, good bathroom facilities and the restaurant area very modern and bright.  The breakfast was excellen and we were most impressed that breakfast runs until 10.30 and 11.00 on Saturday.  Thr 12.00 checkout is also great.  All the reception staff were very helpful and ordered us cabs and booked us restaurants.  Security on the evening is good too.
Would reccommend to anyone and if returning to Dublin I wouldn't stay anywhere else.",5,2009,04,05
248,"Fantastic location, excellent hotel","My husband and I have just returned from a fantastic weekend in Dublin.  The hotel was superb, staff very friendly and always happy to help.  The room was nice and clean, the breakfast was lovely, all fresh and lots of choice.  We have stayed may times at Marriotts and Renaissance, this hotel was of a similar standard, certainly the public and restaurant areas were.  The room was a little smaller than the marriotts but of a very similar standard. 

We had read may reviews before we went and were very apprhensive, but were delightfully suprised.  The 16A bus goes from outside the hotel straight to the airport and costs 2.20 euro each way.  Make sure you take plenty of money with you, everywhere was very very expensive we paid 6.80 euro for a bottle of Bulmers at Gogarty's.  On average a round of Guiness and Bulmers was at least 12 euro.

The hotel is about 15 minutes stroll from Temple Bar and Grafton Street, 10 minutes walk from the famous Hairy Lemon pub.  Loads of very nice restaurants and bar's

Hope this helps sombody",5,2009,03,16
248,"Perfect location, good price, nice people, an OK hotel!","Very nice staff. Clean rooms, not very big but with everything you need. Toiletries every day. They have a nice bar annex lounge where you can sit/drink and eat whenever you like. Fittness and swimmingpool free for hotelguests. Location is on walking distance from main attractions.  Breakfast and lunch options just around the corner. I would not take breakfast in the hotel. Try the Italian sandwiches across the street! Gorgeous. Many
busstops nearby. Next to a very famous traditional pub 'The Bleeding Horse"". Hire a car and take a trip to the Wicklow mountains for great hiking and sightseeing!!",4,2009,03,10
248,"Good, comfortable accommodation",Stayed here for 2 nights.  Bed was comfortable - room spacious and well appointed.  Within walking distance of major sights.  Breakfast was substantial and enough to keep you going for the day!,4,2009,03,10
248,"Good location, clean and spacious","Couldn't be a more convenient place to stay for being near some good nightlife but out of the way of the hordes of tourists... even if you are one.  The rooms are big, beds comfortable, and staff courteous.  The lobby has a decent bar and nice looking restaurant, and there are many good nightspots (some of the best in town) nearby.  The LUAS runs just behind the hotel - keep that in mind as you can't see it right from the hotel but it's there.  Goes up to St Stephens saving you a 10 min walk if you're sick of the hike after a few days.

Downsides - walls a bit thin, pool requires you to wear a cap (!?) you can conveniently buy from the hotel, and staff, while friendly, are a bit out of touch with some amenities and where/when they're open.  No big deal though.",3,2009,02,22
248,Noisy - Unable To Sleep -  Basic Room,"just spent 3 nights at the camden court hotel - not impressed.
we were very surprised to have such a basic standard-looking hotel room - nothing like the one featured on their web site.
1 double bed & 1 single (2 adults, 1 child)
2nd floor right on the road by a busy junction - terrible traffic noise all night long as it's on a one way system & then you get the rowdy drunks all through the night.
I asked to be moved but they said they couldn't (or wouldn't) i jokingly asked if they provided ear plugs - honestly we had disturbed sleep for 3 nights - unacceptable.

only 2 hot drink cups provided - no hot chocolate sachets in the hotel - they charged us for our child's hot chocolate at breakfast - maybe kids should drink coffee or tea these days?

breakfast was included in our room rate - otherwise it would have been 13e each! - good selection however, on our last day it was awfully busy (rugby nation - ireland v france) - they had watered down the orange juice.  the apple juice looked like water. Some of the european staff did not understand the irish staff when asked to fill up yoghurts / marmalades & jams etc - a disaster service.

The pool was freezing all four days - the jacuzzi was only a couple of degree's warmer. 
note - the gym/pool is not just for hotel residents - they allow gym/pool membership to locals.
note - a charge of 2.50e each is made for material swim hats which have to be worn.

note- the 16A bus from outside the airport takes you right outside the hotel for 2.20e adult / 1e child - runs every 20 mins (takes about 50 mins)",2,2009,02,12
248,Great hotel !,Myself and my husband stayed at the Camden Court hotel for a long weekend. We landed at Dublin airport an 8.20am and after checking in with really friendly receptionists we where able to book in our room at 10.00am. The room was spacious and clean. We where really pleased. We did find the location was a little out of the way but none the less we had many a nice walk through St Stephens Green to get to the main city centre. We also dined at the hotel's Central bar which was a pleasant experience. The food was simple and tasty. All in all we had a really nice time on our visit to Dublin and i would not hesitate to recommend this hotel !!!,4,2009,02,07
248,Great stay in Dublin Camden Court,"We have just returned from a smashing weeked in Dublin and we stayed at the Camden Court.  We thought the rooms were great, everything provided - iron, trouser press, tea/coffee facilities, bath, shower, comfy bed - and it was spotless and clean.  We asked for top floor and two rooms together and that's exactly what we got.  The bar was nice and reasonably priced for drinks and snacks.  The breakfast was unbelievable.  Anything and everything you could want, nice and hot and served by pleasant staff.  Everyone in the hotel made us welcome and we would definitely stay their again.  The only negative was that it was a bit of a trek to places but Dublin is a bit sprawled out so which ever hotel you choose you will have to do some walking to get to the attractions.",4,2009,01,30
248,Long weekend in Dublin,"I stayed at this hotel for 3 nights in January. Having read other reviews I was apprehensive before arriving. However, the experience was a very pleasant one. The hotel was clean and comfortable and the staff very helpful.
The hotel is about a 15 minute walk from the Temple Bar area, but there are literally thousands of taxis available.
The only concern with the stay was the high cost of virtually everything, particularly with the poor current exchane rate in respect of the sterling- but that's obviously nothing to do with the hotel!",4,2009,01,26
248,OK Hotel in a Reasonably Central Location,"We stayed at this hotel for three nights over a May Bank Holiday in May 2008.  The rooms are spacious including a comfortable double bed, sofa, large TV, dressing table and a built in wardrobe.  The bathroom was reasonable modern and was clean with a shower unit, sink and WC.  We were on one of the upper floors and had a good night sleep each night with very little noise.  I think it is worth getting one of the upper floors as there is a large bar to the front of the hotel and the traffic is busy on the street infront of the hotel during the morning.  

The hotel isn't located right bang in the middle of Dublin but is within 10 minutes walk of all the shops, bars and tourist attractions of central Dublin.

The breakfast buffet each morning offers everything you could need but this is when you notice how big the hotel is with the number of people in the dinning room!  Overall, this was a good stay and would use it again if in Dublin for business but I may look for somewhere different if I was to come to Dublin with my girlfriend again.",4,2009,01,22
248,Mixed Bag,"The Camden Court Hotel proved to be a mixed experience for me.  I arrived later than I expected on New Year's Eve day and only wanted to get to my room, take a shower, and close my eyes before heading out on the town for some celebration.  The shower was lukewarm at best and when I called down to the front desk the answer I received was that ""it was New Year's Eve and everyone was showering and using all the hot water.""  I reminded the person that the Camden billed itself as a ""luxury"" hotel and that ""luxury"" hotels tend to have a good supply of hot water.  She asked me to wait until the morning to take my shower so that the water could be replenished overnight.  Doesn't everyone take a shower in the morning, too?  A strange and frustrating start to my stay at the Camden.  I checked out the next morning and did experience some great service.  I learned that the friend I would be staying with outside of the city for the next two nights was not arriving in Dublin until much later that evening.  I asked the front desk if I could store my bags until then and they were happy to oblige.  I then asked if I could use the gym downstairs even though I had just checked out.  There was no problem with that either and I had a nice, long workout in the somewhat frigid gym.    I followed that up with a nice, long, and, yes, HOT shower!  Suffice to stay that I wouldn't stay at the Camden again on a major holiday, but otherwise it's fine.",3,2009,01,04
248,A briliant weekend!!!,"I went to dublin to do a bit of shopping, party and spend quality time with my boyfriend. This hotel enables you to do all of these things it is based in an excellent location. The hotel had a range of customers, ranging from older clients to young people like me. It is based in a fairly quiet location however everything is only a five minute walk away! The bedrooms were very clean, the breakfast was yumi and the swimming pool was great. I had a lovely time and will be going back in the future. The staff were very polite and went out of there way to help.",5,2008,12,08
248,Good Value for money and convenient to Grafton Street for Shopping !!,"Just back from a one night stay at the Camden Court. Booked it through Travel Republic. The hotel provides free parking and is a 10 min walk to Grafton Street.

The rooms are clean and basic ..Satellite TV, Hairdryer, tea and coffee making facilties, Iron and Ironing board. We were bed and breakfast..fab breakfast. There is a bar and restaurant, which were quite lively, quite a social scene. The hotel has a pool and fitness suite which is good for a 3***.  

Service was very good...staff very friendly and welcoming .

Would recommend this hotel. Would tend to stay around Ballsridge, but this was a nice change and closer to the City Centre. Dublin is very expensive now, so less shopping this time round !!!",4,2008,11,18
248,not really three star,"stayed here for 2 nights mid week
first night my smoking room smelt like 20 people had just smoked in there, no ashtray, called reception re same, and was told he'd look for ashtrya but they were short of them so he might bring me a plate!!no one ever came to my room with any sort of an ashtray.room very noisy at night.
second night ate in the bar, the chicken korma was actually a very very mild curry and most definately not a korma.
rooms clean, good location but food and reception need to shake it up a bit",2,2008,10,24
248,"Lovely hotel, very welcoming","We stayed at the Camden Court unexpectedly as a one night break, the Westbury and Radisson were too expensive. We weren't expecting much but as a Donegal man I was really delighted to see that a Donegal owned hotel is more than capable of leading the way in terms of hospitality and service. The room we had was really well furnished and immaculate. Room service was more than prompt, a jug of fresh milk was delivered within a few minutes of putting the phone down, something that impressed us. The bed was extremely comfortable, I suffer from a bad back and in the morning didn't feel any discomfort. The bar was nice and to my surprise, guinness was really good - normally hotels are unable to serve good guinness so this was a memorable first. All in all, I would recommend the Camden Court and certainly will stay there again.",5,2008,10,23
248,Loved the Leisure and Treatment Centre,"My self and my husband celebrated our  anniversary and stayed in the Camden Court hotel for three nights. The staff were kind and courteous and couldn't have done enough for us.The room was bright and airy and the bed was one of the best we have ever slept in. Sheets like silk:-)And very quiet as well.
The pool was a treat and we both had a few treatments after which a glass or two of wine and a meal in the Iveagh finished off the day nicely. I would definatly recommend location and will be back again.A++++++",4,2008,10,16
248,A great place to stay,"We have just come back from spending a weekend in Dublin and staying at The Camden Court Hotel.  We were a party of 5 girls and stayed in 3 twin rooms.  Unfortunately all the triple rooms had gone at the time of booking.  We booked on the internet and got a much better deal than booking direct with the hotel which was almost double the price.

We were all really pleased with the hotel.  The reception staff were extremely friendly and helpful.  They helped us find an Italian Restaurant in Temple Bar that we had been to before but could not remember the name of, even making a reservation for us.  There was seating in the reception area which was comfortable and a good meeting place.  The decor was all stylish clean and tidy.

The rooms were clean and more spacious than other hotels that we have stayed in.  Nothing looked worn or in need of attention.  The bathrooms were clean with the normal shampoo, soap and bath cap!! The towels were changed daily.  The shower and bath worked perfectly with good water pressure.  One thing to watch out for when leaving the room is that the door is pulled shut properly and you hear the click.  We came back to our room just after checking in and realised we hadn't shut the door properly.  

The service staff were all hardworking and extremely polite.

The breakfast which was included in our booking was delicious and a perfect start to the day.  Everything was available from a full Irish breakfast to continental if preferred. 

My only gripe would be that we were on the second floor and there was quite a lot of road noise as it seems to be right in the middle of a road system.  However, if you take some earplugs as I did it really isn't a problem.",4,2008,10,09
248,great friendly hotel,"Just returned from spending 3 nights in Dublin. from the start everyone was very friendly we arrived at 09.30 after an early flight we were able to book in and leave our luggage until later so that we could go and explore.
Hotel great didnt use leisure facilities as we didn't have time. The hotel is in a great location close to buses and trams but able to walk everywhere or use public transport, brought a combined bus and tram ticket for just over 5 Euros per day. 
Breakfast good but as previously mentioned could be quite chaotic especially with the large numbers of Americans who all seemed to breakfast at the same time.
Dublin is not to be missed we will definately return to both Camden court and Dublin",4,2008,10,01
248,very nice,"hotel was very nice,clean modern and very comfortable.
the room i stayed in was spacious,very clean and the bathroom was new which was nice.
there is vending machines on each floor which is handy as you could just get a drink in the middle of the night if you had none in the room.
the hotel receptionist was was very friendly and had alot of manners,room service was fast and had my food sent up in max 10 minutes.
the night security made me feel safe,when i arrived in the hotel in the middle of the morning i was not allowed enter until he checked that my name was on the hotel residents list.this let me know that he didnt just let in anybody,which was nice.
leisure facilities were nice,average but nice....
hotel location is just 10-15 minutes walk to grafton street or less then 5 minutes in a car.
overall,i liked this hotel very much and will be visiting again.",3,2008,09,24
248,Clean Hotel,"Just returned after a three nights stay at the Camden Court Hotel dublin,with my Daughter.When we got out the airport we got the 16a bus which takes you right by the hotel,this takes about an hour & gets very busy.The bus journey will cost you 2 Euros,in a taxi 30 Euros.We got checked in quickly & went in lift to our room,when we got in the room they had put us in a double room,we asked months in advance for a twin room.After i had phoned reception was asked to go back down as they had got us a twin room.The room was clean with a nice plasma telly on the wall,carpet had a few bumps in it which i kept tripping over.The bathroom was clean shower not to good tho,came out like a pressure washer ha.We asked for a room in the court yard at the back as the hotel is on a very busy main road.it was quiet apart from the bins getting put out at 6am in the morning,we overlooked offices.Breakfast could be arranged a bit better,you told waitress your room no then they told you where to sit.It was hectic queues were long,we didnt find the breakfast to good,you could tell it had been there for awhile keeping warm.decided to eat in the main restaurant one night.There was a special board so i ordered the steak & tomatoes.When it arrived was a piece of steak with one tomato,you got no potatoes or veg this cost me 20 Euros,you had to pay extra for anything else,this was a disgrace.The waiter came with the bill & told me the sevirce charge was not included ha,we didnt leave one as we had payed enough.You can walk into the city centre which is about 15 to 20 mins walk,but we got the bus which cost us 1.05 euro a trip which was ok.Dublin is a very busy city we had a good time,just watch your bags as people are close to you in the centre.Yes the Camden was nice enough good distance from the city centre,needs to get food prices down a bit tho,even the drinks where very dear.My daughter treated me to a body massage in the hotel it was wonderfull,would stay again one day.",3,2008,09,14
248,Probably should be more than a 3*,"Very nice hotel with a lovely spa ie swimming pool, gym, sauna, jacuzzi etc (which we took advantage of).  Booked with some friends for a few nights in Dublin.  The hotel is very nice and clean.  The rooms were a good size and were very quiet.

We had breakfast in the hotel on both mornings - a very nice buffet breakfast and the food was very good.  Comfy chairs in reception and all the staff were very friendly and helpful.

The only negative thing I could possibly say about it is that if you are not a very good walker (I am not), then it is quite a way out of the busy Temple Bar area and seems a long walk both ways (although  buses seem regular).  The 16A from the airport goes almost to the door (although takes about an hour in rush-hour).

If you want peace and some sleep, it is probably best to be slightly out of the way but half a mile nearer would have been good I think, however you would probably be paying a lot more money for the same facilities at a hotel closer to the river.

Drinks in the hotel bar were very expensive, eg 4 ""halves"" of coke were approximately £11 - they only have bottles so charge you for several small bottles.

All in all, I have stayed in much worse 4 star hotels, and would recommend this to everyone.",5,2008,09,12
248,really nice,"My husband and myself arrived, on Thursday evening.

Reception staff very nice and friendly.

The hotel room was very clean, and pleasant.
We were only staying 3nights but the sheets and cover had been changed on the second night.

We only had breakfast at the hotel but the dining room staff were on the ball, and breakfast had a great choice.

Staff very friendly and helpful throughout the stay.
A big plus was that there is no nightclub in the hotel.

Well within walking distance of grafton street and surrounding area

Will be only to pleased to stay here again!!",4,2008,08,26
248,An adequate hotel not too far from the city centre.,"We stayed in this hotel at the start of a tour. We found the room quite up to scratch. We had a rear room so was fairly quiet except for the moving of waste bins early in the morning. Unfortunately there was no air conditioning so had to have the window open. Room comfortable and clean. Didn't eat in the hotel but breakfast fine. The staff were very fiendly and worked hard. 

Why is it that two drinks in Ireland are always 10 euros wherever you go!

Was adequate but could do with air conditioning.

Reasonably well placed for access to the city centre.

This may seem a strange recommendation but could be useful for, say ladies eating on their own and the like. We found that M & S in Harcourt Street have one of their first table service restaurants here. It was excellent value and choice and very clean. They even have an open terrace on the roof space adjacent to the restaurant. The manager told us that it is a service which M&S plan to roll out accross the UK soon. All power to them. It was very good.

Hotel served its purpose and no major critisims.",3,2008,08,14
248,Fabulous Experience,Me and my partner stayed at the camden court hotel for a night in july - the service we recieved was excellent and we loved our stay. We will certainly recommend this hotel to any of our friends and family that come to visit dublin. The hotel is so easy to locate from dublin airport and we are pleased to say that we are using the hotel again in september!,5,2008,08,12
248,Fanastic Hotel,"Only stayed at the Camden Court hotel for one night but booked it off the back of a recommendation from my boyfriend who had previously stayed here. For the price, the hotel is absolutely fantastic. The room was perfect (although they do tend to get a bit hot so you'll need to keep the window open), with a good sized bathroom, powerful shower and plasma screen tv with satellite tv. 

The lobby was run efficiently, and the staff at reception were really friendly. The leisure facilities are great, but remember to bring a swimming hat if you want to go in the pool (Irish law says you have to have one in a public pool). We had lunch in the bar, which was very nice, although the Polish staff sometimes had a bit of trouble understanding what we were trying to say. The breakfast buffet is one of the best I've ever seen.

The hotel is perfectly located, about a 10 minute walk from Grafton Street but far enough away to escape the noise, and costs 25 Euro to get there from the airport.

I will definitely stay in this hotel the next time I go to Dublin - great value for money and in an excellent location.",5,2008,08,04
248,"Loved it, except for forgotten wake-up call!","My mom and I stayed at the Camden Court for two nights in June. The hotel is easily reached by bus from the airport (we got off about a block away), and very conveniently located for dining and site-seeing—just a minute or two on foot from St. Stephen’s Green. Our twin room was clean and comfy, bathroom fully functional (and rather nice, actually!), and street noise minimal. There was a sign on the main entrance alerting patrons of construction, and I once took a wrong turn in our hallway and ended up in some kind of unfinished area, which was a bit weird, but we didn’t hear any construction noise or see any workmen while we were there. Not sure if the place had wi-fi, but for non-laptoppers they had coin-operated internet in the lobby; it was expensive, though—a euro per 8 minutes, I think (more than the local internet cafes). Meant to go for a dip and the pool looked nice, but we never got around to it. I was perturbed that they charged a connection fee (35 cents or something) for calling freephone numbers. I was even more perturbed that they forgot our wake-up call! We’d set phone alarms for back up (of course), so it didn’t matter really, but if we’d been relying on it and missed our pre-paid tour for that day as a result, I would’ve been extremely annoyed. I complained when we checked out and the man at the desk apologized but didn’t offer compensation and basically passed the buck by saying his colleague was supposed to have made the call, he hadn’t been in at the time, so he would have a word with her. Oh well. Overall we had a really nice stay, and I would recommend it. (And check out nearby Kitty’s Bistro—DELISH!)",4,2008,07,29
248,Friendly welcoming hotel,We stayed in the hotel for one night with our 8 month old baby and thought it was excellent.  We arrived early saturday morning and parking was no problem.  Staff at reception were very welcoming and friendly and arranged an earlier check in for us - 12 rather than 2pm.  Rooms were perhaps on the small side but they were very clean and well maintained. The leisure centre was brilliant for a city centre hotel and the swimming pool was well heated with a toddler/baby area sectioned of from the main pool. Staff were very accommodating to all our requests e.g heating baby food.  Location was great - a short walk to grafton street/st stephens green.  We will definitely return to this hotel next time we are in Dublin.,5,2008,07,07
248,Noisy,This is a very nice hotel but I would not stay there again.  In June it is warm enough that you must open the windows.  We change rooms twice because of the noise from the street and court yard.  Our friends also had the same problem.  We did not sleep much during our three day stay.  They need air conditioning or fans. Also the only transportation to the airport is via taxi.  We order one thru the front desk for four adults and lots of luggage but a small car showed up the next morning.  We managed to stuff everything into the back plus luggage on our laps for the long ride.,2,2008,06,29
248,Good location,"We stayed at this hotel from May 9-13, 2008. The location was perfect - close to nearby attractions, central, and surrounded by lots of shopping and pubs.

The room was spacious, comfortable, and clean. We had a room overlooking the courtyard. During our stay, part of the courtyard was being repaired, which meant construction noise from 8:00 A.M. until 5:00 P.M., Monday - Saturday. This was a bit of a nuisance, as we slept with the window open to improve air circulation (the room did not have air conditioning).

The ice machine was handy, but the room did not come with an ice bucket. We were 'urban camping', and had brought a collapsible camping sink/bucket, which when filled with ice, worked as an impromptu refrigerator.

We did not eat any of our meals at the hotel. We made use of the Fresh supermarket (better selection than the Tesco Express), just down the street. This was also handy for a few beers ;-)

The hotel staff was friendly and accommodating.

We booked this hotel through priceline-europe and got a good rate, much lower than anywhere I had checked for a central Dublin hotel.

The shuttle to the airport was merely a 5-minute walk away, which was also convenient. Apparently, there is a city bus that has a stop in front of the hotel or quite near to it, but we never made use of this.",3,2008,06,04
248,"Great location, will probably be back, needs some improvement though.","Hmm, not bad, needs some improvement though.  Arrived to find hotel car park packed, was lucky to come across someone leaving just as I was about to give up, definitely didn't relish the idea of trying to find alternative parking in that area of Dublin.  Friendly and helpful staff at check-in.  Decent sized, well kitted out  and clean room overlooking courtyard.  Room was reasonably quiet .  (Our friends had a room overlooking the street, this room was very noisy in comparison to ours).  Some building work still ongoing in the lobby at night, didn't really effect us.  Went out for a meal, arrived back in pleasant hotel bar, had one drink, was ignored for 15 minutes at understaffed bar while looking for second drink and decided to go to bed instead.  Left a number of disgruntled but more determined people still waiting to be served.  Discovered on going to bed that my side of the bed had a large slump in it, like a huge man had sat on the edge of the bed and broken it.  Made the best of it (slept ok) and reported it to reception on check-out but felt that housekeeping should have spotted the problem before I reported it. 
The breakfast buffet was a bit of a shambles with a log jam at the toaster/juice machine leading to lengthy queues which got progressively worse as the late breakfasters arrived en-masse for the last half hour of breakfast service.  I had up to then breakfasted leisurely and reasonably well on fruit, yogurt and cereal and decided that the queue was too long for me to bother going for bacon and eggs.  But I was annoyed at the poor organisation which forced me to make the choice.
Overall  impression was great location, pleasant building, friendly staff but needs better management to give real value for money.",3,2008,05,26
248,Good value for money in central Dublin,"I stayed there with my husband and my mum for a ceremony in Dublin. Had chosen the hotel with Tripadvisor and wasnt disappointed. 

Very nice 3 stars hotel. 

Extremely helpful and efficient staff to check in. Had booked a double and a single room and discovered 2 singles. The change was done immediately and with a smile. During all this, we lost one of the room key but this was sorted out very quickly with no bother at all.

Room are spacious, clean, a bit aged though but very comfortable. We both had room at the back so very quiet too for an hotel in center of Dublin (and in a very busy street). Bathroom fine.

Room service efficient: despite the fact that mum didnt order breakfast the night before she decided for a breakfast in her room in the morning. They apologized to the fact that it wouldnt be quick as they had to serve the breakfast which were ordered 1st and gave us a delay of 30-40 min. Breakfast arrived in 15 min.

Restaurant extremely nice. Service perfect. Food good and good choice. Lack of a bit of atmosphere as it was nearly empty but it was just what we needed after a very busy day. Very relaxing!!

Location: nice and busy street, lots of cafe (to have a lovely and cheaper breakfast), pubs, restaurant, little shops, 10 min pleasant walk to Stephens Green and Grafton St.

Overall, as a 4 stars hotel woman, I will probably come back in this hotel in Dublin as it was a perfect 3 stars, clean, comfy, handy, and less than £100 in center of Dublin! Just need a bit of sparkle!",4,2008,05,19
248,Very Nice Clean Hotel,"The Hotel was excellent, I would definately use this hotel again.
They gave secure luggage storage for us as we had early flight in (could not check in) and a late flight out (had to check out.)

We did not use the gym because of the amount of walking we did around Dublin itself.  I was going to use the swimming pool but read in the brochure that you needed a swimming hat to swim (male or female) so I did not bother with this.

We did not eat breakfast here, there is a Tesco Metro and a Fresh supermarket within 2 minutes walk of the Hotel so we got our breakfast from the bakery inside there.  There is a pub next door which didn't seem to make excesive noise to keep us awake (we were on the 6th floor.)

The room itself was very hot but the staff provided us with a fan after I asked for one.  An ice machine was provided on the 4th floor (6 altogether,) there was a notice saying not to use glass but they did not provide any cups - their holders were empty on both days that I went to it.

Overall a very nice stay, excellent staff, just seemed a very long walk - 40 mins when we got off the airport transfer bus just above the Spire on O'Connell Street (maybe we got off too early.)  This transfer bus at 10EURO return is highly reccommended.",4,2008,05,15
248,Could Be Better,"Room was very basic (for the price) but large enough with a good-sized bathroom. The room faced onto the courtyard where a constant loud hum from a generator could be heard. Despite being April and warm outside the heaters were pumping out hot air for most of the evening. We were told that we could not turn them off as all rooms were controlled by timers, and if we wanted it to be cooler we were to open the windows. The mattress and pillows were very hard too so it was a bit uncomfortable at night.
Breakfast was fine and the lobby/restaurant etc was very nice. I thought the hotel was very expensive for what we got. I wouldn’t be going back there, as I'm sure there would be cheaper hotels with better rooms.",2,2008,04,29
248,Brilliant Hotel,"Stayed at this Hotel, weekend just gone 28th feb - 2nd March. Staff were really nice from the outset and were very helpful. We didn't get chance to check out the pool or other facillities, however, we did read that if you wanted to go in the pool you needed to wear a swimming cap (were avaliable at 2.5 euro from the hotel). 

If anyone is flying into dublin we found out after we got of the bus about 20 mins walk from the hotel that it stopped virtually right outside the hotel. The bus you need to get is the 16A from the airport, it was 2 euros takes longer than the sky shuttle bus, but you get to see a bit more of Dublin. And the same going back we jumped on right outside the hotel and went all the way to the airport. Took about 30mins on a Sunday. 

To temple bar its about 10-15 mins, and we felt safe walking home at night.  If you miss brekfast there is a gorgeous sandwich shop just up the road towards temple bar called 'Fresh'. 

Would definitely stay at this hotel again, and more important I would recommend it to friends and family.

p.s there is pub right out side the main entrance of the hotel, so good starting place to enjoy a few Guinness.",5,2008,03,04
248,Very Comfortable Stay,"We have just returned from a great weekend in Dublin and the very nice Camden Court Hotel.  There were 8 of us (30-somethings!) occupying 4 twin rooms for 3 nights (31/1-4/2).  

On arrival we were greeted by efficient and cheerful Reception staff and our rooms were allocated in no time at all.  We were all situated on 2nd floor overlooking the main road (yes there was some noise from the traffic outside but nothing major and certainly nothing to complain about!).  The rooms were very comfortable and well-furnished/decorated to a modern taste.  

The bar area was modern and the bar snacks were lovely.  Enjoyed the Irish cooked Breakfast each morning - didn't bother with cereal/cheeses but there definitely looked to be something for everyone.  

Pool area was lovely and we didn't find it too cold like someone else said but obviously it was cooler than the jacuzzi and we saw no evidence of grime/slime that another reviewer has reported.  There is also a steam room/sauna which were great for relaxing in as well.  Didn't go into the gym but it looked well-equipped from what I saw.

All-in-all a very good 3* hotel and for what we paid we felt we had value-for-money with this accommodation.  Would definitely stay at the Camden Court if we visited Dublin again.  Good security on the door at night as well.

Dublin I have to say was great in terms of shops/bars and was about 15 minute comfortable walk to where all the action was.  Was good to stay in a hotel that wasn't in the thick of it so all good from our point of view!!",4,2008,02,05
248,Regular Haunt,"I stay in this hotel regularly, for business. It's not perfect, but I simply cannot understand the more negative reviews. I find (most) of the staff friendly, the hotel clean and breakfast good. 

I have to admit the refurbishments are a pain - particularly the chaos in the car park. Nevertheless, there's a good atmosphere, rooms are good and the hotel is central. What more could you want?

I have never used the pool/gym, so cannot comment on this.",4,2008,02,03
248,The Camden was very comfortable,"My husband and I stayed at the Camden while visiting relatives just outside of Dublin over New Years 2007/2008.  The lobby was very welcoming and comfortable and the staff was fine- we didn't have any problems.  One thing I noticed - and I don't know if they do this in all major city's - was the security.  If coming back to the hotel after 10PM we were met at the door by security and checked against a list.  The room was clean and comfortable, although the linens weren't exactly high quality.  It was also very quiet, which was surprising on New Years.  We had a room on the court yard, not the street, which would probably have traffic noise.  They had a big breakfast room that could accommodate a lot of people, and the food was better than expected.  The location is within walking distance of everything, which you could say about most of Dublin I guess.  I would definitely recommend and stay here again.",4,2008,01,25
248,Rooms Need a Facelift,"The Camden Court has a convenient location in a lively part of town.  The lobby is well-designed, and the young people at the desk are friendly.  The rooms, however, are drab and dark, and the breakfast facility looked (and tasted) like a school dining hall.  Dublin itself has a lot of zing.  Camden Court seems left behind",3,2008,01,19
248,Very nice hotel only a few minutes walk from city centre,"My friend and myself stayed here for 4 nights in mid November, Very nice hotel only 5 minutes walk from temple bar and main shopping area. Hotel has a lovely reception area with plenty of sofas and armchairs for sitting and relaxing before you venture out. Breakfast was buffet style with the usual cold and hot selections which filled us up nicely for the whole day before our evening meal. Lovely pool but we never actually went for a swim in it as you HAD to wear a swimming cap. Plenty of good restaurants just round the corner including DICEY'S GARDEN which served steakhouse type food in beautiful comfortable surroundings and Saagar  Indian restaurant which had an excellent menu with very tasty food, both these resaurants were excellent value, around 60 euros for both of us including a bottle of wine.",4,2007,12,20
248,good hotel near central Dublin,"Hi all,

This hotel was a solid 3star city centre hotel. There were 6 of us in 3 seperate rooms. The rooms were fine LCD TV and big bath room in each room plenty big enough for 2 people. Breakfast was fine, full Irish or continental. If you wanted a little quiet time eat in the bar it was much better than the breakfast room. 

The hotel is currently renovating to extend its restaurant and breakfast room so it's a bit noisey during the day, however it is quiet at night.

The hotel bar was cool opened all night. We visited the restaurant and it was supurb if you stay here you must visit it!!!! Reception was fine no dramas there.

Dublin is a typical city with quality night life everybody must go to Temple bar in the evening it rules. Make sure you visit Dublin Gaol(Jail) it's a wonderful experiance brilliant guide and and excellent tea room and it's only 6euroes bargain.

If you fly in get a cab to and from airport it's only 35euroes it's a much better ride than the bus I can tell you!!! 

Enjoy your stay!",4,2007,12,11
248,Pack your Earplugs!!,"Stayed at The Camden Court last weekend - lots of positives - clean and modern in an excellent location with very good leisure facilities, all at a reasonable price. Unfortunately the downside is noise and ventilation. We stayed in a room facing Camden Street, it was very stuffy but when we opened the window the street noise was horrendous and when we closed it no noise but no air! - We asked to be changed but were informed that building work next door was likely to repeat the experience. This is our third time staying - in the past we usually stayed overlooking the  internal courtyard but any noise from there is magnified as it acts like an echo chamber. I think next time we will try their sister hotel near the Grand Canal",2,2007,12,09
248,Beware of noise,"Just a note to anyone considering staying in this hotel - check if the building work there is still continuing. Barely managed a couple of hours sleep due to extreme levels of noise from an adjacent building site - not sure if they were working on the hotel or offices next door but full-scale building work went on until at least 6.30pm (when we left for the evening) and started again at around 7am. During the night, it sounded like there were one or two people still working on the site, with the clanging of pipes being shifted etc. While our rate was quite reasonable - 89 euro for the night - I would definitely have paid the 40 or 50 euro extra to stay in a Jury's Inn or similar establishment where I would have gotten a proper night's sleep.",2,2007,11,30
248,Worst Hotel Ever Stayed In,We have just returned for a weekend in Dublin.  There were 22 of us and although we enjoyed the weekend the hotel was awful.  When we checked in on Saturday afternoon the electric was off - we were told it would be on again at 4pm.  Some girls went to the bar while others headed out for lunch.  By 6pm the electric was still off and no one was allowed to their room.  It was annouced that the bar would be serving free drinks but each time someone ordered a drink they were asked to pay for it.  The staff were so rude and didn't seem to know what was going on.  Tealight candles and small torches were used for lights - very dangerous as we witnessed a child put paper on a candle which started a small fire - the staff didn't even know how to use the fire extinguisher.  The electric came on at 7.40pm and because we were eating in the hotel had to rush to get ready for 8.30 with no hot water.  The waitresses were so rude and practically threw our meals at us - at 10.30pm.  We had many more problems with the hotel - too many to mention.  When we came to check out we were offered at 10% discount - so pathetic.  We had no choice but to pay as we had a train to catch.,1,2007,10,29
248,Hmmm Ok Hotel,"I stayed in this hotel when it just open and had a great weekend.  This time i was in Dublin and decided to stay here for the 3 days.  The hotel is clean, comfortable, 15mins walk to Temple Bar.  

There is a small but decent gym and swimming pool.

The hotel is currently under going some upgrading so the resturant was a bit of an experince especially in the mornings, in fact on the final morning I give up as I couldnt get a seat.  The cold buffet is very limited but the quality of food on the hot buffet was good.  I asked for Green tea and it took them almost 15mins to bring it to me - not the most difficult task in the world

Overall its a reasonable city centre hotel with car parking.  The staff are generally very pleasant.  Overall the hotel is clean (mind you on the fist day they didnt empty the waste paper bin in my room - very minor but still)

Would I stay here again - yea sure.",3,2007,10,23
248,good value for Dublin,"stayed one night, booked due to reasonable price and fact that hotel has underground carpark.
not enough spaces for hotel guests in carpark though, had to drive around 5 times.
clean room, but really stank of cigarettes, asked for another room, to be told there was only twins left, so stayed put.bathroom clean and comfortable.
not enough lighting in room, husband had exam and could not read in bed. only at desk.
noisy outside, but it is Dublin city.
great location in city centre, good value, breakfast good, but not much for my veggie husband.
overall happy with it for one night in Dublin city centre.it was clean, and the car was not vandilised!",2,2007,10,15
248,Good Hotel,Excellent hotel The room we first went in to was rather noisey but staff moved us to new room The room itself very good. Would recommend hotel to anybody going to Dublin. Food very good. Cost us 10 euro by taxi to city centre.,4,2007,09,29
248,Not well maintained,"I booked this hotel because the reviews here were mostly positive.  If you are coming from the US, you may be disappointed with this hotel.   You can't really read in bed because the lighting is very dim. The rooms are large and the plumbing is fairly modern for Europe. However, both the shower head and sink faucet in our room needed replacement.  When we asked for the shower head to be replaced, we were told they didn't have one and could not get one from another room.  This is a large hotel with several hundred rooms.
There are two elevators in the hotel and one was broken for the entire weekend causing long waits and crowding in the only remaining elevator.  The front desk staff are all eastern European, so were not able to help us with directions or tourist information.  We were directed to the Tourist Information Office which is a good 20 minute walk.  The hotel is not as close to the city center as they stated, so if you are not fit or don't feel like walking late at night plan to spend money on transportation.
I would have used the internet for information, but the two computers in the lobby were both out of service for the entire weekend.  If you spend any time at all in the room, book early at a hotel listed in the better guide books.",2,2007,09,26
248,Excellent Service,"Booked for 1 night, but needed 2, Hotel was full, but they searchd high & low and managed to locate a room, so left me in my original one and moved the person who had booked mine into the new room. Great service

",4,2007,09,06
248,great hotel,"The Camden Court is a fantastic hotel. Very clean and comfortable, with very friendly staff. We stayed for 3 nights, bed & breakfast, Fri. Sat. & Sunday. The breakfast was very good, continental or traditional english breakfast. We looked at the dinner menu in the hotel restaurant and it looked excellent, although we didn't book there. We also looked at the pool area which looked really good but unfortunately didn't get time to use the facilities. We got the 16A bus from the airport which took us more or less to the door, the bus was busy, it took just over an hour and cost 1 euro 80. A taxi would of been around 30 - 40 euros. We was about a 10 minute walk from St. Stephens Green and about 20 minutes to the Grafton Street shopping area. We was a good way from Temple bar and always took taxis which cost between 10 and 15 euros for four of us. There are thousands of taxis in Dublin and getting one was never a problem. We also did the bus tour which cost 12euros 50 each and was valid for 24 hours. Dublin is a fantastic city with something for everyone, there are many wonderful eating places with prices on a par, however the beer is twice as  expensive to what we are used to.
We booked Camden Court directly through the hotel and would consider it to be value for money given the extra leisure centre area and breakfast which many 3 star hotels in Dublin do not provide.The hotel is in a good location away from the busy, noisy areas, but not as some reviewers have said in a quiet run down area, in fact just the opposite, there are many pubs and eating areas on Camden Street, & there is no noise from passing traffic or people however  the only downside to the hotel was that there is building work going on at the rear which did wake us up on the Friday, but not a problem at the weekend, so although I would definitley recomend this hotel I would advice you to check on the building work!
We would most certainly book again at The Camden Court on are return to Dublin.

",4,2007,09,03
248,A bit of a shame,"We stayed at this hotel back in 1999 when it first opened and it was excellent so we thought we would give it another go on a return trip. Overall the hotel is good but the building work waking us up before 8am didn't get us off to a very good start. The hotel did not advise of this when we booked. The main problem was the organisation in the breakfast room. We were told by the very pleasant foreign waiter to sit anywhere but he omitted to tell us how to get our breakfast,the breakfast is completely self service. We realised after a few moments that we had to get our own tea/coffee and then our own breakfast/ there were no signs to advise what the protocol was. The cold buffet was poor and very little choice of fruit etc. The hot buffet was excellent and the choice really good . We then asked four different  staff, all eastern european for toast eventually retrieving some from the bread area after the fourth request. This happened both days of our stay and unfortunately the staff did have trouble unerstanding english. The pool was still really nice and the bedrooms were clen and tidy although the furniture did need alittle updating.Alittle more attention to detail and this hotel could be excellent

",4,2007,09,01
248,Excellent,"Lovely hotel, really enjoyed stay here. Staff very friendly and helpful. Rooms very nice, swimming pool lovely. Hotel is central, near grafton street, stephens green etc.

",5,2007,08,27
248,THis is a great hoet,"I have stayed at the Camden Court in 2003, 2004, 2005 and twice in 2007. The lobby is very nice, the staff is excellent and the breakfast is very good. It is very centrally located within city centre and Temple Bar,  but far enough away, 3 blocks, that you don't have the noise. The rooms are very nice and comfortable. I go to Dublin from the States on business. They have a geat pool, work out room, Jacuzzi, stem and sauna.

Great hotel.

248,Highly recommended,"My husband and I stayed at the Camden Court recently and we were very pleased with the standard of service and the accomodations. We arrived very early in the morning and they did not have a room ready yet, so we stayed in their very nice lobby to wait. While waiting we noticed that the staff was constantly cleaning, rearranging furniture, and just making sure operations were running smoothly. Although they were very busy with other guests, the front desk staff was very courteous to us each time we checked back regarding the room. They actually stand out as being the most pleasant front desk staff we have encountered for a while. As soon as a room was available we checked in. The room was very clean and comfortable, and was very quiet ( our room overlooked the beer garden). The hotel is very conveniently located close to town and the Luuas station. We did not have breakfast included in our rate, so we ate at a great place called Gerry's that is just off of Harcourt Street down a little laneway. A mini breakfast is 5 euro, and it is more than filling. We will stay there again next time we are in Dublin.

",5,2007,08,08
248,really enjoyed this hotel!,"There was 7 of us on a 21st birthday. we took the train to dublin and when we arrived at the hotel we were very pleased! really nice hotel, bus stop a few meters down the road. Rooms very nice, comfortable. the leisure complex in the hotel was also very good! The hotel is quite far from the centre and we never walked in but getting the bus was very easy and only 1 euro. There are lots of bars, clubs restaurants etc on the street that camden is on. and some nice 1s just behind the hotel too! so not much need to go into temple bar for a good night out! would definitely return to this hotel! very pleased!

",5,2007,08,05
248,Pretty Good,"I stayed here for a week as part of a Dublin tour in late July/early August 2007. The hotel is in a rather ""dead"" area of City Center. It's not dangerous, just lots of closed businesses without a great deal of foot traffic. Despite what some other reviewers have said, it isn't a very long walk to Temple Bar/Dame St., unless you are old or incapacitated. It took me about 15-20 minutes to walk there, and I walk at a brisk pace. St. Stephen's Green is also nearby (you HAVE to see this; it's beautiful!), as well as some great shopping in the St. Stephen's area. The hotel itself is pretty good. The rooms were fine and overall the hotel staff was very helpful. The restaurants always seemed understaffed and hurried, but no one was rude. One outstanding employee was at the front desk (I can't remember her name!). She was a ""trainee"" but very professional and courteous. I arrived early (around 10 AM) after 20 hours of flying. Although my room wasn't ready yet, she told me she would try to get them to hurry, and my room was ready by 11 AM. Excellent! Here's a Tip: Breakfast is included in most stays. Room service breakfast is also free (except for the mandatory 2.75 Euro service charge). I hate going to restaurants first thing in the morning, so this was a real bonus. Apparently tipping isn't usually done here. I gave the room service waiter 5 Euros and he was shocked. Guess I made his day! Only a few gripes: On two occasions my wake up call came late (one day it was actually an HOUR late!). Also, in a time when most hotels offer free wireless internet, this hotel charges about 10 Euros for an hour (or the ""better"" deal of 15 Euros for 24 hours). There is an internet cafe just around the corner that charges only 1 Euro for thirty minutes -- so I recommend going there and saving your money. The food in the restaurants was not great, not bad; pretty typical for a hotel. Go around the corner or down the street. There are plenty of local places that are much better and much more reasonable. Overall, however, I was generally pleased with the hotel.

",4,2007,08,04
248,Great Dublin Hotel,"Before I went to Dublin, I did a ton of research on hotels and Camden was the best that I found for the price.  It did not disappoint.  Yes, it was a little bit of a walk, but it was nowhere near as bad as what I thought.  I honestly never took the bus into the downtown area and though the walk wasn't bad.  Our room was to the back, so we didn't hear much noise.  The breakfast and restaurant area were great.  The bed was the most comfortable one we had in Ireland (and we stayed at approx 6 hotels).  One of the elevators broke, so that was the only bad thing I have to say.  I'd definitely stay there again.  Oh, and I would also recommend the Bleeding Horse, which is a pub right outside Camden.  We tried many, many pubs and kept coming back to the Bleeding Horse because it was our favorite.  Very cozy ambiance with lots of little areas to sit.  We also stayed at Jurys Christchurch for a night and thought Camden was much better.

",4,2007,08,03
248,Not best pleased,"There is a bus stop which is located about 100 metres away from the hotel, with buses going straight to the city centre and Temple bar area. The buses cost 1 euro each way, so it's not too bad, but a little inconvenient. If you feel a little more energetic, then you can walk it in about 15 - 20 mins. Overall, I don't feel that the hotel is best located, and there isn't anything to do in it's immediate vicinity.

",2,2007,07,29
248,We nicknamed this hotel The Pit of Dispare,"This hotel was recommended by a company I was visiting for business.  Its horrible.  The walls are so thin and the noise is insane.  They have buses coming and going all night long with bus loads of people, you will not sleep at this hotel.  The rooms are no frills, the bed is hard as a rock and mine is at an angle, i've heard others say this too.  It is clean, I'll give it that.  The air is stale and there's no fan or air conditioning here to at least move the air around.  Your only choice is to open the window but hear more of the noise of the buses coming in, or sleep with it shut and be very stuffy.   

Restaurants weren't bad.  I'd only stay here if I had no other choice.  A co worker stayed at the Fitzwilliam by St Stephen's Green and it was much nicer for the same price.

",1,2007,07,03
248,Loved Dublin and the Hotel,"I have returned after a 3 night stay at this Hotel.  I booked directly with the hotel as my DIL had stayed here twice.
I booked directly with the hotel asking whether the had any special deals on.  I was staying Tuesday/Friday.  They didn't have but did give me a good price better than any  of the booking agents on line.  Also much better than the price on their own web site.
I had requested a non smoking and quiet room.  I was on the 2nd floor near to the lift.  My room faced on to a beer garden and was very quiet.  The room was comfortable with 2 beds and adaquate storage for clothing etc.  The condition of the room was excellent and the bathroom spanking clean with new tiling etc and a wonderful power shower. I missed not having a fridge but other than this I had no complaints.
The staff were welcoming and friendly but also very efficient.  The dining room staff were also although they tend to clear the table when I had gone back to the buffet.  The following morning I told them I was coming back to the table.  Really it was not a problem.
The breakfast was good althought I did not eat a cooked breakfast.  I didn't use the restaurant in the evening.  
I travelled from the Airport to the Hotel by the 16A bus which dropped me just beside the hotel.  Cost only 1.90Euro.  I took a taxi to the bus station and this cost 11 Euro.
The reception staff were helpful with bus routes and other information I required.
My only thought was that this hotel is a little further out than I had expected.  I did walk in and out on the first day but took the bus to O'Connell street on the following days.  Very frequent buses and numerous bus numbers so didn't ever have to wait more than 2-3 minutes.

Overall I had a wonderful time in Dublin and really enjoyed staying at the Camden Court.  I would not hesitate to recommend this hotel.

",5,2007,06,25
248,Great location!,"We just arrived back after 2 days at the Camden Court. We had a wonderful time in Dublin. The hotel was a perfect choice for us. We arrived early after an overnight flight from the U.S....took a cab...very personable driver, from the airport. We couldn't get right in, but the hotel took our bags and off we went to explore Dublin. My suggestion from this hotel is to walk through St. Stephen's Green and take advantage of the Hop-On Hop-Off Bus service around Dublin. The pub/bar was perfect for our dinner the first night. The rooms in the back and on the upper floors are best to ward off street noises. Very comfortable. The buffet breakfast included in our rate each morning was great! Our second night we felt very safe walking from the Temple Bar area back to the hotel at 10 o'clock at night...about 30 minutes. All in all a lovely hotel, great location, friendly hotel staff...great introduction to our 10 day trip to Ireland.

",5,2007,06,18
248,Comfortable hotel,"Over all my boyfriend and I had a very nice stay at the Camden Court Hotel. The hotel is within a walkin distance from the city centre (10 min), at the southern side of St. Stephens Green.

Room:
+ Nice and clean, bathtub, comfortable bed, quiet (but we we're lucky, since most of the hotel rooms face a busy street), safe in the room
- No view, no minibar (only roomservice) or refreegiator

Facilities:
+ Good Irish breakfast, ok swimming pool, sauna and fitness centre (but not spa quality), ok hotel bar, efficient room service, car parking.
- No free internet access, lousy continental breakfast.

Service:
Nice, friendly and efficient service throughout our stay. The hotel webpage give an accurate presentation of the hotel.

If you are staying several days at the hotel, we recommend not to pre-order breakfast, as there are plenty of nice bakery shops etc. nearby.
",3,2007,06,04
248,Would definately return!,"We found this hotel to be roomy and clean. It isn't luxury but very clean and affordable. The lobby was nice. We chose it because it was away from the city noise but near the bus stop. There was an occasional bus or truck noise outside at night but nothing constant. 

The towels were very very soft. There are no washcloths or clock radio. 

My friend and I split a room service club sandwich and salad, which was really great. We did not find their breakfast to be any value at all and would not recomend it. They did have have great coffee. 

We felt safe there but the building across the street was boarded up. It felt as if it were on the ""outskirts"" of town. THe Bleeding Horse Saloon next door was nice. 

We took bus 16A from the airport and got there within an hour for E1.80. We didn't mind the ride.  Also went across the street and got back to the airport on the bus.

",5,2007,06,02
248,Good overnighter,"We only stayed here one night and the main attraction was the fact that it had its own car park and was close to the city centre. It was quite a challenge to find by car, due to the one way system, but once there we found a space and parked okay. Reception was busy, but efficient and we could have our room immediately, which was great. We were also given lots of information, which was helpful - i.e. pool opening times and meal times.

The room was spacious and great for three of us. We didn't have the time to use the leisure facilities unfortunately, as time was so short, but apparently you need to wear hats in the swimming pool - so remember to take yours if you don't want to buy one at the hotel. Breakfast was the usual, but average, buffet style for everything ( and I mean EVERYTHING - you have to go and fill your own tea and coffee pots!) except for the hot food, which was served to you at the hot buffet. The breakfast room was packed to the gills, but waiting time for a table was not a problem.

",4,2007,05,31
248,Beautiful Hotel,"We stayed at the hotel on the 26th and 27th May for our anniversary.
Once we reached our room, the staff at campden hotel had upgraded us to one of their suites. The suite was lovely and spacious and very clean wtth a queen size bed. The staff are very pleasant. The breakfast in the morning finishes at a reasonable time so you do not have to make sure you are up at the crack of dawn to make sure you get your breakfast. The swimming pool is a good size and the jacuzzi is lovely and warm. We will be recommending this hotel to everyone we
know.

",5,2007,05,30
248,Great Hotel,"We stayed at the Camden for 2 nights on the 23rd March 07 and we couldn't fault the hotel at all.  The decor is fresh, stylish and modern, the room was spacious and spotlessly clean, we didn't really speak to the staff much but on arrival and departure they were very curteous.  The location was ideal for us, about 10 mins walk away from Temple Bar and Camden Street itself has some great pubs to break the journey.  We would definately consider staying again.

",5,2007,04,30
248,A great experience in Dublin,"This is our 2nd trip to Camden Court Hotel while visiting our son who is studying abroad in Dublin.  The hotel has a great location - only 3-4 blocks from Grafton Street and the same from St. Stevens Green.  Having stayed on the 4th and 6th floors we found it very quiet.  We booked the bed and breakfast and found it very convienient.  Breakfast was good and all you can eat.  Used the restaurant 1 time at the same time as a big soccer match, but easily found a seat and there were no rowdy people.  Staff is cooperative and friendly.  Rates are good for this kind of a hotel in Dublin.  I recommend.

",4,2007,04,26
248,Keep looking!!! Skip it!,"A waste of money and time.  We stayed for two nights, the second night was Good Friday.  On afternoon arrival, our room was not ready and we had to leave our luggage  in a messy room off the lobby.  We asked the receptionist if museums were open the next day, as we were concerned that it was Good Friday, and were told that they were- no question. We wanted to take our kids to a soldier exhibit at the museum.  We got up early Friday to head there and found that she was wrong!  the museums were closed and our day was wasted.  We wish we skipped Dublin as there is not much for kids to enjoy.  The hotel staff did nothing to appease their mistake- we paid the price by having a wasted day in Dublin.  They just said that they ""apologize"".  I say that they are responsible for tourist informtion dispensed by their staff and should have given us a discount, at least.
In addition, the rooms are worn out looking and carpeting in the too narrow hallways is full of stains. The location of the hotel is noisy and ugly.

",5,2007,04,23
248,Loved this hotel!,"Well me and my friend stayed at the Camden from the 11th- 15th April . Were 18 and wanted a girly trip to see Dublin and go out etc. As Im a travel agent they upgraded our room which was so kind of them. We had the most amazing time and the hotel was brilliant. The staff were always there to help, whatever you needed at whatever time. The hotel was very clean and very posh defo should be a 4*. The pool jacuzzi, sauna and steam room were amazing we had such a relaxing time using these. The gym is also good with lots of differant machines for you to use. Breakfast was ok, I didn't like the hot food but the breads etc were lush. Location is probably the best you can get as we found we only visited Temple Bar once as its so comericalised and we wanted to see the real Dublin. The tram is just behind the hotel taking you to grafton street, which we preferred, lovley restaurants. Theres a street right by the hotel( can't rember the name) and it has the best night clubs we went to them and has the best time we didnt meet one English person in there only Irish so it shows you the real Ireland. This street leads right down to grafton street! so for us the hotel was in the perfect place . Eating out isn't as expensive as everyone sais we found that we ate in posh restaurants every night with a bottle of wine for around 20 euro each ! The shopping centre is beautiful so many shops, it really is worth a day out there. The people in Dublin are so friendly too , we found we could't even walk down the street without someone asking us if we were ok or introducing themselves ( people around our age) The taxis are an average English price , the drivers have lots of useful information so would be best to jump in one for the first night to get to know all the great places to visit around.We will defo be coming back to Dublin and staying in this perfect hotel. Also the Manager Anthony is great and will help you out with whatever you need. Stay at this hotel and I promise you will love your stay in Ireland
P.s be sure to go to the guiness factory and Dublin castle(the hop on- hop off bus will take you to lots of attractions for a small price)

248,above average hotel,"We went to Dublin to celebrate a 40th & 50th birthday party, and so we booked a party of seven into the hotel between the 31st March and 2nd April. After reading previous reviews, I requested quiet rooms at the back of the hotel, which we were duly given, and they were very quiet.  Our rooms were quite roomy, with a large flat screen tv which was nice, and there were tea/coffee making facilites which we didn't actually use.  The bathroom was a little on the small side, and appeared nice, although a little 'frayed' around the edges - I dislike shower curtains! The breakfasts were very good with cooked and continental choices, and would highly recommend booking B&B (especially as meals are so expenseive in Dublin).  We had a few drinks in the bar most evenings which was very good also.  We found the staff to be helpfull in giving us directions and booking taxis for us on several occassions.  The area around the immediate hotel was a little on the rough side, but we never felt this was a problem. Walking to St Stephens Green/Grafton Street took around 15 mins - which was great as I would not have wanted to stay right in the city. On the whole, I would definately recommend this hotel, and possibly checking the rates through the hotel (we paid £40.00 less that some advertised sites).

248,Camden Court Is First-Rate,"We stayed 3 nights at Camden Court first week of March, 2007. We chose it based on TripAdvisor reviews and were not disappointed. Everything about it was highly satisfactory. We arrived quite early in the morning, before 10:00, but were able to get a room very shortly after arrival. The room was quiet and clean and well-appointed as was the bathroom. The tariff included a full breakfast each morning. The staff was most helpful. Several reviewers below commented on the distance from the center of activity, but we found it no more than an easy 10 minute walk to St. Stephen's Green and only a block off the tram line that ends at the Green. We also found a very nice little Italian restaurant just around the corner on the street leading to the Green where we had two most pleasant and reasonable meals. Camden Court is highly recommended and for the price, I wouldn't even look elsewhere if I returned to Dublin.

",4,2007,04,02
248,Great hotel on the whole,"My husband and I stayed at the Camden Court hotel for three nights in March.  As we were in Dublin for St Patrick's Day the number of available hotels was small so we took our chance and booked this one.

The hotel was very pleasant.  Our room was on the fifth floor and a lot bigger than most double rooms we have stayed in.  We had plenty of space.  The bathroom was nice with lots of hot water and a powerful shower.  There was a big plasma screen tv.  My only complaints would be that there wasn't any tourist information in the rooms and there was a limited amount of tea, coffee etc in the room.

The breakfast was good with a lot of choice.  We ate at the hotel restaurant twice in the evenings and were very impressed with the food.  The hotel bar was also good.

Reception staff were on the whole helpful except for when we checked out the girl was a bit miserable.

The hotel was quite a way from the centre of Dublin - about 15 minutes walk.

",4,2007,03,25
248,Beware of the noise from the Bar,"We stayed here on a Friday and Saturday night in Mid March.
This hotel is a 20 minute walk from the centre of Dublin and costs about 11 euro in a taxi.  We had lunch in the Central Bar in the hotel the day we arrived and that was very good and there is a good atmosphere in the bar.  The rooms are a decent size but ours smelt of smoke on arrival.  The Leisure facilites are good  in the hotel so that is a real plus.  
We enjoyed our stay but the real problem was that when we went to go to bed on Saturday night at midnight, the noise/music from the bar could be clearly heard in our room.  When we phoned down to complain they simply said it was on until 1.30am and there was nothing they good to about it, so we were not pleased about that.  Our family had a room on the other side of the hotel and no noise could be heard, so it is worth requesting on check in a room on the opposite side to the Bar. Also breakfast is good but very busy from 100am to 1100am so worth it to get up a bit earlier!!!

",2,2007,03,12
248,typical 3 star city hotel,"We stayed at the Camden Court Hotel for 2 nights to celebrate a mates 40th, there were 16 of us in the party ( 8 rooms) and on the whole I think the hotel covered our needs pretty well. The hotels location is not bad, it is about a 15 min walk to the top of Grafton street or 20 min to Temple bar at an average pace. Temple bar cost about 12 Euro in a cab, though there is a tram stop about 90 secs from the hotel which will drop you by Grafton street. There are various fast food joints/ coffee shops/ supermarkets all within 1/2 mins walk of the hotel.

The rooms are not huge but just about adequate with a comfy double bed, not rock hard or a marshmallow. There were all the usual hairdryer, tea/coffee making facilities, tv, desk, chair and a trouser press.

The bathroom was a reasonable size with no obvious mildew . The biggest negative was the bath towels, I am 5'8 and a UK size 14/16 and they only just covered my bits after a shower (length and width), so if you are on the larger size of the population you may wish to take one of your own towels if you have room in your luggage.

Our room was right next to a set of fire door which I was not happy about, but the fire doors did not slam like in some hotels so this was not a problem.

At breakfast I was looking forward to a good Irish fryup after a night of drinking and dancing, unfortunately I was really disappointed. Although the restaurant was busy (10am) everything tasted as if it had been cooked and left under warmers or reheated. The cooked breakfast did look better on the second morning though I was assured it didn't taste much better. I just opted for the continental which wasn't bad, but the selection isn't huge. 

On the whole the staff were neither overly pleasant or rude, just doing their job.

I didn't use the pool though some of our party did, I didn't hear any complaints and I don't know whether the 'you must wear a swimming hat rule' was enforced.

We didn't have a problem with our bill on check out but I did find the process a little weird. The hotel had taken a swipe of our credit card on check in so on check out the receptionist took our room number, typed on the computer asked for our credit card then said thank you here's your card and your receipt. There was no being told what the amount was before it was taken off our card or being asked to check if the billed amount was right. It's the first time this has happened to me and I didn't like it. I obviously checked the bill and it was OK BUT ........................... I don't know it just wasn't right!!!!!!!!!!

248,Nice hotel but situated on a very noisy street,"For value for money it is a very good hotel.

The rooms are clean and spacious and there is a good variety of hot and cold food served for breakfast between 7 and 11 so there is no rush in the mornings.  The bar menu is varied and the food was served quickly.  It is about a 5 minute walk from Grafton Street.

The only problem we had was the noise from the street.  One side of the hotel overlooks a very busy road which has bars and a lot of traffic passing through it.   After the first night (a Saturday) we asked if we could be moved to a room at the back of the hotel because we had next to no sleep all night, for whatever reason this was not possible so we had to endure another 3 nights of very interupted sleep.  Whether there was a problem with the double glazing or not we cannot be sure.  

So whilst yes I did enjoy my stay here and was happy with the facilities I would recommend that you ask for a room towards the back of the hotel and not on the main road or you WILL have very very interupted sleep from the noise outside.

",4,2007,02,27
248,Check your Bill Carefully!,"Facilities :- I booked 4 twin rooms via the hotel website, for a total of 8 people.  Everything was in order when we arrived, and we were all very pleased with the hotel, the staff, it's facilities and the rooms.  The rooms are spacious and clean, and have a flat screen TV, hairdryer, kettle etc.  The staff are accomodating and friendly, and obtained taxi and restaurant reservations when requested.  

Food and Drink :- We ordered room service one morning - it was cold when it arrived so not recommended - and we had breakfast downstairs the following morning - there was a good choice, both hot and cold.
The bar is very nice, we didn't eat any meals other than breakfast whilst we were there but the meals that other people were eating looked good but they were a little over priced.

Location :- The hotel itself is set quite a distance from the main attractions of Dublin.  It is walking distance but I would recommend comfortable shoes as we were all struck down with blisters on the first day!  

Negative points :- When we checked in, our party decided to pay in full in advance so that we could check out quickly.  However upon checking out we were advised that we needed to pay a further 109 Euros.  This was the hotel's mistake, the receptionist had not registered enough on the till when we paid and we were therefore accused of not paying the bill in full.  The duty manager would not accept that it was their mistake and would not let us leave the hotel without taking a photocopy of a credit card!  We obviously refused and advised her to check their tills and left, giving the hotel a mobile number to contact us on.  She then phoned us within the hour to advise that it was their mistake however gave no apology for the embarrassment that she had caused.  So if you pay in advance, check and keep all of your receipts!

There was a function in the hotel on one of the nights that we were staying.  There was a lot of noise from drunken party goers who were congregating outside the hotel to smoke cigarettes.  Even though the windows were closed we could still hear a lot of noise, and that was the case even for other members of the party who were staying in rooms at the other side of the hotel.  If you want a quiet night's sleep I would suggest you check with the hotel beforehand regarding functions.

",4,2007,02,07
248,comfortable,"just had 5 days here. very reasonable rate booked online. room basic but comfortable. staff on the whole were neither particularly pleasant nor unhelpful. food was delicious, cannot recommend the three course dinner enough. our room overlooked the front of the hotel on the main road, would suggest booking a room at the rear to anybody else as it was quite noisy with traffic and the bar below. the swimming pool/jacuzzi etc was desperately in need of modernising and heating! had to go in the steam bath to get warm. also very noisy at night due to noise transmission from neighbouring rooms.

",3,2007,01,20
248,Not for business travellers,"The positives -- the room was very clean.  The neighborhood is authentic Dublin -- not posh, but close enough to the main venues and with some real character. The staff were efficient, if harried and without any welcome.

The negatives -- they sell rooms directly over the pub (I was the lucky winner of one in that wing) which became a disco at 10:00 PM with booming noise until 1:00 AM.  I could make out every word of the disco anthems (Donna Summer, etc.) being played along with booming bass along and every word of the drunken smokers' conversations in the courtyard.  I called the desk to complain, was transferred to the manager on duty who told me there were no other rooms, and... ""It is Saturday night...,"" the clear implication being that one should expect this level of noise even when paying 110 euro for a fairly basic room. 

When checking out (early -- the hotel lost three nights business from me), I told the clerk again that my stay had been unsatisfactory and there was absolutely no apology and certainly no concession.

Other comments -- beds are adequate, but the pillows were hard and lumpy. There is wireless Internet access, but it is not complimentary.  I can't recommend this hotel to business travellers.

",1,2006,12,21
248,No Complaints,"I would reccommend this hotel to stay in. The car park is a bonus. I found it convenient enough to city centre ie a pleasant stroll. The rooms are spacious and comfortable with everything you need, they have recently been refurbished. If you dont want to go out for something to eat there are dining options in the hotel. The first night we had a tasty snack in the bar. The second night we dined in the restaurant and the early menu is good value. Any staff we had dealings with were pleasant and helpful. There is a good leisure centre but unfortunately the sauna and steam room were out of order when we were there. I stayed in this hotel the weekend of the marathon and although it was very busy I had no complaints.

",4,2006,11,21
248,Loved the hotel!!,"The hotel was perfect, reception is very classy, staff nice and helpful, rooms clean, bright, nice coloured, we also liked the nice plasma tv, absolutely not noisy. It's the perfect place to stay in couple, it's very romantic! The pool & sauna were great!!

We recommend this hotel to every person who wants to visit Dublin but stay out of the noisy streets where Dubliners party!! It is about 20 minutes walk to the city centre, but it is very easy to find and Irish are very helpful with tourists :)

PS : Book via the hotel's website, we got cheaper prices than the ones indicated in the room!!",5,2006,10,24
248,Great Hotel,"We stayed at this hotel for two nights and really liked it.

The staff were all helpful and polite, check in took a matter of minutes and any questions/requests we had were dealt with and advice helpful.

The rooms were very nice, reasonable size and clean and comfortable.  We didn't hear any noise from other rooms so either our neighbours were very quiet or the walls are reasonably thick.  We faced onto the  back of the hotel and there was some noise, but this is a city centre hotel so noise is to be expected and did not bother our group at all.

We used the leisure centre which was very nice after a busy day/night out!  We also had some treatments at the beauty room and these were lovely and relaxing, definitely recommend!

Breakfast was nice, I had a full fry up one morning and it was all lovely and hot which is quite unusual for a self serve buffet as often  the food sits around under the lights for a while and is luke warm.  The breakfast definitely hit the spot if you have had a late night out sampling Temple Bar area!!!

The lobby is nice to sit in and there are some waiters who come around to get you drinks, the bar is also very nice.  We had some of the bar snacks and they were very nice and, I thought, a reasonable price for bar food,

We mainly got cabs into the centre that reception ordered  for us, but it is easily walkable - about 15/20 mins.  But is was quite wet when we stayed so getting a cab was a better option - about 12 Euros (4 people in cab) to Temple Bar.
  
We enjoyed Dublin as a whole, and found it to be a friendly city with a good atmosphere.

All in all we were very impressed and happy with the Camden Court Hotel, and would recommend it to anyone who was looking for somewhere  to stay in Dublin - very nice!

248,Not dissapponted in camden court,"I used this website extensively before making some choices, so now I am ""giving back"".   Wife and I ( from Louisiana USA) stayed at Camden court 5 nights during golf tournament. Hotel was clean, lobby spacious with  seated lounging areas by TV. Connecting bar was nice.  We never went to gym.  Front desk check in was courteous and knowledgable and accurate.  Wake up calls came as requested,  requested fan for room arrived forthwith, and ""booked taxi for 6:15 am"" next day departure was spot on time.  Recent Dublin taxi fare rates so fare from airport to CC was only 24 euro  and worth it (change a small amount of currency at airport).  We requested fan because of general climate rooms have no A/C and may be a tad warm on full sun days...fan helped this and also its steady hum makes for a nice sleep aid.  Our second floor room (202) end of hallway therefore only one room next to us.... over looked the back (of two) parking porticos which I at first thought might translate into nocturnal noise,  but it did not.   The rooms across the hall were on a busy street and I can not comment on noise in those rooms.....good room might be an 02 room number on higher flow....note that ice machine on 4th floor, but not every floor.  Front desk has adapters for the 220 v current, but even with that we tripped a breaker so I would be hesitant to bring and plug in any expensive USA 110 V a/c device.     Room itself was quite satisfactory and shower was especially nice. Prepaid breakfast buffet gave satisfactory choices and the seating area was charming and leisurley.  Good coffee.   Louisiana folks might want to take a small Tony's with them.  Town center area  ie Grafton thru O'cconell  street / river liffey about a 12 minute walk north . ...REMEMBER cars come from opposite direction and it could be quite easy to look the wrong way and step out in front of oncoming traffic and be KILLED>...mind (pay attention to) the walking lights.   Night time crowd mostly under 30...but generally  they are world wide anyway.  Some unique shopping, but no bargains.  Nearby also luas (pronouced ...lewis...) electric tram at Stephens Green ( public park.)  Put coin in  touch screen machine for  return tickets and ride about just to see what you might see.  This also easily done with hop on/ hop off bus tour... buy ticket from bus driver . Irish stew at shehan pub very good...go to second floor for better seating/ tv.   In center area we found a ""lebonese restarurant"" that was actually a generic Italian and should be avoided.  East Indians were good yet for lack of time time we did not try Mongolian restaurant.   Camden Court was quite OK.

248,Great Value for money,"I stayed in the Camden Court hotel due to its location. I was working the following day nearby and needed somewhere handy. The weekend that I stayed was the All Ireland Hurling Final so most city centre hotels were either booked out or were too expensire. I got a booking in the Camden Court on a web site and the price was very reasonable. When i arrived on the Sunday evening the lobby was buzzing with people and the atmosphere was very friendly. I was checked in within minutes by a very friendly member of staff. My room was on the 5th floor so off I headed to the lift. I usually have a big problem with hotel lifts and how slow they go but not this one. Although the hotel seemed very busy, there was no delay on the lift. Once I got into my room, I was a little disapointed to find the window closed considering the heat of the day so the room was very stuffy. But as my window overlooked the car park i could open it with little noise (obviously not the idea view from your window but it was getting dark anyways so there was very little to see) To cool down i decided to have a shower. The towels were very fluffy and soft but just a little on the small side. Soaps and stuff in plentiful supply and very pleasant smelling. The shower was fantastic. A lot of different pressures so you could have a gently shower if preferred. I decided to go the whole hog and was nearly pinned up against the wall the pressure was so strong. Not everyone's cup of tea but for me this was heaven. The room had cooled down significantly at this stage so i ordered some room service. Not a large menu but plenty of choice for a snack. The food arrived very quickly and was delicious. Toasted sandwich was crispy and not soggy (as can sometimes happen) and the coffee was stong and hot.
Before I settled down for the night I had my usual check for stray hairs in the bed. Not one did I find. The duvet on bed was much more comfortable than blankets and the pillows high and plump. The overall cleaniness of the room was to a very high standard I am very pleased to say. The carpet looked very new and from the pattern on the floor had very recently been hoovered. The bathroom was spotless with even the taps gleaming
I asked for an iron and ironing board and they were deliver very promptly by a very pleasant young lady who had turned and gone before I had a chance to give a tip.
The next morning I ordered breakfast in bed and again the coffee was hot and strong. The cooked breakfast contained beans and mushrooms which I do not like but that is a personal choice as opposed to a fault of the hotel.
Overall the hotel was very enjoyable to stay in. I have stayed in a few hotels in Dublin and other big cities and this one comes very high up the list. I would definately recommend the Camden Court hotel if you want somewhere that is very central. Also if you are like me and very particular about hygiene this is the place to stay.
",4,2006,09,19
248,Good Hotel and Good Location,"I stayed here with my sister, niece and nephew during the school holidays as it was the only hotel we could find in Dublin within our price range for 4 sharing a room at €163 through their own website.

I had stayed here 1 year previous and i was delighted to find that they had refurbished the rooms and bar. 

The room was spacious, with two queen sized beds and one single bed. The bathroom was clean and roomy, there was plenty of towels, complementary shampoo, etc for all of us.

The pool is a bonus especially when you have children, it is located in the basement, it has a suana, steam room, jacuzzi and a decent sized pool, with a little kids pool also and a fully equipped gym. But i must say staying this time they need to turn their attention to refurbishing the pool area next it has gotten a little grubby.

It is only one Luas stop from St Stephens Green, and the stop for the Luas is just outside the door of the hotel.

The buffet breakfast in the morning is great, they have everything from cereals, fruit, yogurts, juice, tea/coffee, toast to a hot breakfast, you will not go hungry here.

The bar is really trendy and the bar staff we found very friendly especially with the kids.

For location this hotel is great to stay in, it has car parking facilities also. But as another reviewer said it is difficult to find it.
",3,2006,09,18
248,"Great city, great hotel","We only stayed in the Camden Court for one night last April but we wish it was longer. We liked everything about the hotel. The location was great (difficult to find when driving but their directions were pretty good). The hotel's a 20 minute walk from Temple Bar through a lovely Notting Hill-like area - full of character day and night and felt very safe too. 
The hotel itself was modern but without having a bland chain hotel look about it. The rooms were spacious and clean with a decent sized bathroom and nicely furnished. While we were there the downstairs bar was closed for refurbishment but a temporary bar had been set up in the large lobby area. The lobby  seemed to be used by some business people, perhaps spilling out from the function rooms - this didn't bother us but might be better to be aware of this business atmosphere during the week.
The pool and gym looked great - we were only disappointed because our stay was not long enough to make the most of them. We did take advantage of the breakfast included in our package - a decent cooked breakfast in the hotel's restaurant.
Another advantage of this hotel is their secure carparking facility - we were able to park overnight for free which is often difficult in Dublin. And after we had checked out they let us leave the car there until late afternoon so that we could enjoy another day in Dublin city centre. 
We would recommend this hotel to any of our friends or family and we would certainly go back there ourselves. We actually only booked this hotel from a friend's recommendation after being let down by a large international hotel chain (not The Simple Life after all!). It worked out well for us as this one was much nicer anyway!
",4,2006,09,13
248,Nice hotel,"My husband and 6 yr old son stayed here for two nights on 7/22 & 7/23.  We had a good experience.  Rooms were clean and large and bathrooms very nice.  Breakfast was excellent, and they offered a full breakfast, as well as cold cereal, a variety of rolls/bread, yogurt, and fruit and juice.  It is about a 10-15min walk to Grafton St., and a little longer walk (20min or so) to the Temple Bar area.  There is a bus that stops less than a block from the hotel that runs to the airport and only costs 1.85 Euro.  

My only complaint is that there is no air conditioning, and it was very hot when we stayed there.  However, the staff was very accommodating, and gave us a fan for our stay, which made it more bearable.

There is a leisure center in the lower lever, with a pool, whirlpool, sauna that is nice.  However, you have wear a swim cap if you want to swim but they do have them there to purchace (it was about 2.50Euro).

I would stay here again.

248,Our stay was fine...,"We stayed two nights in this hotel at the start of our coach tour of Ireland.  The hotel is quite new (only a few years old) and our room was nice.  The windows did not open very wide but the weather was not terribly hot so we were fine.  The duvets were very fluffy and the staff at the front desk were friendly and efficient.  

The hotel is well situated to get into town and we walked over to St Stephens Green which is a lovely park.

The breakfast room was very crowded in the morning as several tours were departing the hotel.
",4,2006,07,29
248,Very Poor Service,"I had a very disappoining stay at the hotel, it did not live up to its advertising or reputation. I was very specific to book a double smokeing room. I even went so far as to phone hotel reservations to confirm this and was told it would be no problem at all unfortunately I was given a non smokeing room with two single beds. I showed my confirmation to both the person who checked me in and the manager neither were to pushed to help me. I actuall put my oponions on a comment card but I did see the same young lady remove I spoke to take it the next morning  I actually named them on the comment card but I will not name them here(two females with bad attitudes).

The room was actually a health and safety hazard as it was so hot, the T.V, was not tuned in properly nad the young ladys told me there was nothing that could be done until the morning. I headed to the bar to be told there was no peanuts available nad the glass was dirty

I tried to sleep but to no avail and ended up trying to connect to the internet in my room after paying for  a passwrod I could not connect and the person I phoned for help could neither help me or care.

Now for the best bit, I was in a que for about 10 minutes for breakfast to be told '' yea we will be with you in a minute'' the bacon and sausage were poor to say the least and I was refused a boiled egg. 

I paid and left,

248,"Brilliant Value, Great Hotel!!","Had a great overnight in the Camden Court, I live on the outskirts of Dublin and used the hotel as I was meeting friends in the nearby Odeon Bar. Booked it on the web and it was only €99 for the 2 of us for the night which is fantastic value for a city centre hotel. 
Everything about my stay was just brilliant, very friendly check in, nice lobby and bar in the hotel, the restaurant looks a bit dated though. Breakfast is served till 11am which was fantastic as i was slightly hungover the next morning.

248,Dreadful hot smelly hotel room!,"We were part of a coach tour of Ireland and this was our first hotel. Staff at reception not at all helpful with our luggage despite my mum being less able. No air-conditioning and the room was hot and humid overlooking the coach drop-off point. Also it was where the staff smoked out side so the room smelt of stale cigarette smoke and was noisy at night. Decoration was old and tired. Not a very nice room at all and I wouln not stay there again.
",2,2006,07,21
248,Good location,"This hotel is in a good location to walk and take the bus everywhere.  It was very hot & humid because it was the hottest week Ireland has had in years and no, there is no air conditioning in the rooms.  The windows don't open very wide either so my parents had to get a fan in their room which was old & dingy.

The bathroom comes with a bath/shower and toiletries and is large, as was the room and closet/drawer space.  

They had a gym, beauty salon and pool but we never used any of that.  The lobby is nice and comfortable for sitting and having a drink or just talking.

The breakfast was not very good.  They have very few choices of bread and what they did have was stale and had mould on it.  They only had tinned fruit as well.

The hot breakfast was OK but the line to get something is very long.  The juice is also from a carton and doesn't taste very good.  The waitstaff are all foregin and are running around a lot.

There is one woman at the front desk who is from Eastern Europe and does not seem to know anything nor is very helpful.  In fact no one who worked there knew much about the area and couldn't help us with directions or restaurants.

We enjoyed our stay but there are probably better hotels out there
",4,2006,06,19
248,Dont Stay Here,"Upon arriving at the hotel I waited approximately 20minutes to check in by someone who clearly does not want to work in the hotel, the grounnd floor toilets were nothing short of a disgrace and the room I stayed in was little better dirty bed linen and a dirty bathroom, complained to a a young lady at reception who claimed to be a manager but clearly had better things to do than help me.
Was served by a rude barman who I interupted reading his paper behind the bar.
Terrible nights sleep, warm, humid rooms with no Air Conditioning lots of street noise, clearly this hotel is locted in a bad area.
Th best is yet to come, breakfast was perhaps the worst breakfast I have ever eathen in 20 years traveling, thank god I we didn't have dinner in the hotel.

Really Dont go here

248,Dublin in Halloween,"Me and my wife went to dublin in oktober 31.2005 - We were so lucky to be there on Helloween. I would say to any one  If you like to get a Halloween costume and go to the biggest costume ball in the world go to Dublin on Halloween.

Enough about that, the camden court hotel is not in the heart of dublin but it is only a 20 minutes walk to temble bar and about 10 minutes to St. Stephens Green mall an park. 
The rooms are comfirteble and cleen. The brakfast was wery good and ther is a traditional Iris bar just next dor. Good for some Guinnes. 
But the extra plus for the hotel is the fantastic spa at the ground floor. After a long day of shopping there is nothing better than going in the jaczzi and the steam bath.

I would stay at the camden court if I went back to Dublin.

248,Good Value - Great Staff,"My family stayed during the third weekend in April.  The fitness center was great for the kids - although a little more seating around the pool would have been nice.  The rooms were clean, and we were quite comfortable during April as no air-conditioning was necessary.  When we did have the window open it did get a little noisy - especially on Saturday night.  The breakfast was good and the staff was outstanding.  They were so helpful in every way.  For a decent hotel only 8 minutes walk from St. Stephens Green with underground parking - this is one of the best deals you will find in the city.  I would definitely stay there again.

* No Air-Con in rooms,  and if you are in the odd numbered rooms the noise from the busy main street below means that you can't open your windows.

* The leisure complex opens at 8 at the weekends as opposed to 7 during the week.  Not helpful if you want a early start.

* I found the twin room to be spacious but found the bed very hard and unconfortable.

* Bring you own biscuits to nibble although there is tea/coffee facilities in the room

* The bathroom doesn't have an extraction fan or it didn't work in room 405 as I felt I was having a sauna after my shower!

All in all, this is a great hotel for the money £40 pppn and a great irish breakfast thrown in.  Location wise it hits the spot also as it takes 10min to walk to St Stephens Green or take the DART and you'll be there in 90 seconds!

248,Ready for a chat...,"A short break in mid-week was excellant value, perhaps because the bar was being refurbished. The staff were friendly and always ready for a chat. Time has a different meaning to the Irish, even in the capital! Room was fine, breakfast good. A request for fresh fruit was met immediatley. Early bird evening meal was very good but the full dinner menu looked a bit pricey. 
Close to the Canal for a pleasant walk and 10 mins to Grafton St shopping. I would stay again without hesitiation.
",4,2006,04,08
248,"Clean, comfortable but be careful how you pay","A pleasant enough place to stay in Dublin.  Currently undergoing some refurbishment so the main bar is closed.  Friendly multinational staff, good location.  Underground car parking is restricted at present due to works, but it's free if you can find a space.  Good sized rooms, clean and comfortable, and a pool/leisure centre.  A good breakfast but the only irritation arose at checkout: when paying with a credit card from a UK bank, the transaction was automatically converted into sterling rather than being charged in euro.  This 'dynamic currency conversion' is supposed to be at the discretion of the customer but since virtually every business that does it fixes rates that are below the bank rates, it is almost never in the customer's interest to go for it.  When I told them to reprocess the bill in euro they were not pleased, but it was done.  Not a problem peculiar to this hotel, but one to watch out for when using plastic outside the country where you bank.
",4,2006,04,01
248,Building work,"Hotel was fine, location was average 15 min walk to St Stephens Green, the breakfast was great.

But beware the Hotel is currently under renovation, the room which was allocated to us was right above the works we were unable to use the room until 5.30pm, we requested a change of room and as it was the rugby weekend they did not have any available for us.  When booking your room make sure that they have rooms available away from the building works.

We were given a discount.

248,Loved this hotel!,"I read many reviews on this hotel, some good, some bad, and was a little worried I would be disappointed, but it was fine!!!

Staff were lovely, rooms were fab, breakfast was excellent, and the location was great.

I would like to point out that there is a 'scenic' route to the city centre, past St. Stephens Green which leads you to the shopping area, and another 'not so scenic route' which takes you directly to temple bar.  So it's up to you what your priorities are, but avoid the latter at night.

The hotel is expensive, but it is difficult to get one that offers better value.  You dont get biscuits with your tea/coffee but you get decent shampoo, soap, shower cream, shower caps etc if you dont take your own.....(shower is pretty good).

It'l cost you between 6 to 8 euros for a cab from the centre at night, and the hotel will be happy to arrange taxis for you.

Enjoy.........
",4,2006,03,14
248,shame,"OK the Hotel was fine, as you would expect. ALL the staff were excellent in all respects. Even though they were under extreme pressure. Twin room 229 smaller than a travel lodge in UK, but comfortable, quiet and had all we needed. (no safe although there was a safe deposit at reception) However, during our stay, the electronic room keycard system was broken so we had to be escorted to our room when we needed entry, the bar area was being refurbished, which reduced the available bar facilities to those more commonly found at a wedding reception in a village hall, drinks and glasses on a table etc. and at breakfast (which was superb) on Monday, the cereal counter caught fire! We paid top dollar for our stay, which unbeknown to us, clashed with the rugby international, so prices were hiked sky high. Although not directly the fault of the hotel, our stay was a bit of a shambles. I purposely paid well over the odds to get a good hotel for my wife's 50th birthday. I do not feel that I received value for money. If the hotel reads these reviews, maybe a voucher for a revisit sometime, because under different circumstances, it could have been an excellent experience. Good location, a serene oasis far enough away from the downtown madness but close enough to walk and indulge. I will recommend this hotel. But I Hope you are luckier than we were.
",2,2006,03,01
248,Really friendly staff,"We are a family of 2 adults and 2 children and really enjoyed our stay here. Despite it being a really busy weekend (rugby international) the staff couldn't do enough for us. We had interconnecting rooms and after mentioning that the radiator wasn't working properly in one of the rooms we were offered electric heaters straight away (the radiator eventually worked properly). The beds were really comfortable and the rooms were quite roomy. There were tea/coffee making facilities in the room but bring your own biccies.

Swimming pool was great and location of hotel was really convenient for going into town.

I would definately stay here again. A really friendly, comfortable hotel.
",4,2006,02,28
248,Loved it here,"I stayed here for 2 nights with my husband. We were welcomed by very friendly staff, the room was lovely, the breakfast was great and the leisure facilities were excellent. Also, the position of the hotel was good, only a 10 minute walk to St. Stephens Green, or catch a frequent bus down to the Temple Bar area, no problem! We would definately recommend this hotel to anyone who wants to stay near the centre with leisure facilities.",5,2006,02,21
248,Overpriced and overrated,"I don't understand all the good reviews for this place.  I spent a week in Ireland travelling around by car and have been to Dublin before.  Take my recommendation and stay in one of the million B & B places all around Dublin. We paid 110 Euro for the night with breakfast, and I think that was about 50 Euro too much.  The room was clean but small and dated. The breakfast was awful and if you have a choice I'd go without and get a proper Irish breakfast at one of the many pubs.  The location is in a pretty dodgy area and we didnt' feel safe walking around at night.  There were no toiletries either, so make sure to BYO.
",2,2006,02,08
248,Nice Hotel & Great Location,"Stayed 3 Nights whilst working over a long weekend, very good value, excellent facilities, rooms very comfortable, staff pleasant and attentative, restaurant and a small lounge bar onsite (more atmosphere to be had though at the local pub ""The Bleeding Horse"" on the corner) Great location for walking into the centre of Dublin by day or night although the new tram service is just around the corner.
Would visit again, hopefully next time on a leisure break thus having more time to enjoy the facilities and use the swimming pool etc.

248,Everything you need for a great break in Dublin,"This was our 2nd visit to Camden Court, and it did not disappoint.  Arrived at 10.30am after an early flight - bus 16a goes down Camden Street from airport, buy a one day rambler ticket for 5 euros and use it for the whole day too, inc going down to Temple Bar in the evening for your meal! a taxi costs 28 euros, which we treated ourselves to on way back to the Airport. Our room was ready for us which was a plus, had expected to leave luggage and come back later.  The reception is very impressive, wood panelled and elegant, staff very smart and polite. This is a 3 star hotel but deserves 4 stars.  The rooms are clean, including the bathrooms, free tolietries and drinks. Room service only 2 euros extra, we had this one day, bang on time and very pleasant.  There is a pool, gym, steam room, sauna and large very bubbly jazauzzi, great after a day walking around Dublin. We booked a day tour to the Wicklow Mountains to get some fresh air and quiet away from the city one day - lovely.  The shops are fantastic, plenty of real irish pubs, modern restaurants, and for Irish dancing go to The Arlington Hotel Near O'Connell street, across the bridge from Temple Bar who have free shows every evening from 9-10pm including irish singers - brill with a pint of guiness in one hand and a plate of irish stew in the other! The guiness really does taste better in Ireland - smooth and creamy.  Cassidys bar is also in Camden Street, where President Clinton stopped for a pint with his bodyguards in 1995 - about 100 yards from hotel.
Worth a visit - i'd go again.
",4,2005,11,18
248,Would Stay Here Again!!!,"The hotel was lovely, most of the staff were great.  The Concierges were very friendly and helpful.  Knew almost everything to know about Dublin for the tourist!!

The food was outstanding in the Lobby and Restaurant and Breakfast was amazing.  Continental and Cereal to start then onto a full Irish, no need for lunch after that!  Restaurant was expensive, but then most of Dublin is.

The Leisure Suite was great, the pool was a bit cold however and the ceilings could do with a lick of paint.

The rooms weren't spectacular, but clean and well furnished and presented and very large.  

The new LUAS tram system is only a few yards up the road if you don't fancy the 10 minute walk to St Stephen's Green.  With the tram, we found it pretty much central.

Would definiately stay there again. We booked through ---- and got a really good rate, a lot cheaper than what the hotel rate offers.
",4,2005,10,22
248,"Great Location, Large Romms, Great Staff","I have to agree with the previous review.  I thought the hotel was great.  It was in a prime location, very close walk to grafton street and temple bar.  The Bleading Horse Pub next to it had great food.  Our room as well as the bedroom were very large.  There was a great lounge in the hotel lobby where you could drink some tea or have lunch.  The staff was very helpful with recommending good places to eat.  The hop on hop off bus even makes a stop there 2x's a day to pick up the hotel guests.  The only negative comment I have is that our room was located on the second floor right at the tour bus entrance, so it was a bit noisy but that's to be expected and the breakfast food wasn't the greatest, but it was free.  Other than that I was very with the hotel and would definitely stay there again.
",4,2005,10,19
248,Had a great time at Camden Court!,"I have just come back from a five day stay at the Camden Court Hotel and just had to write a review.  I picked the hotel because of its price and the fact that it had a leisure centre, however I looked on Trip Advisor before booking and was a bit concerned about the mixed reviews, especially as it was a suprise party booking for my husband's birthday and we usually only stay at 4 or 5 star rated hotels.  However, if anyone has read the bad reviews let me say do NOT let them put you off booking.  

We pulled up at the hotel and it is impressive looking.  The car parks were small but we had no trouble parking (maybe because it was midweek). Lovely reception area, staff very smart, polite, smiling and helpful.  Up to our rooms which I had booked as doubles, one had an extra single bed and the other two extra single beds, so plenty of room.  Spotlessly clean and comfortable, although the shower curtain smelt a bit. The rooms looked over the road and were a bit noisy, but hey you are in Dublin!  I suggest if you want a quiet hotel you should stay in another city; Dublin parties until about 4am even on weekdays, so yes you do get noise, litter and the occasional vomit on the pavement.  The hotel is only a 10 min walk from Temple Bar, and the hotels in the centre must be far noisier.  

Straight down to the Irish pub for a great pint of Guiness and  again, lovely friendly staff.  We only used the restaurant for breakfast and there was a good selection of both hot and cold. I didn't have the sausages as I'm vegetarian but the eggs were fine (if you like them well done just ask!) and I ended up having a cooked breakfast every day which I never do at home.  Everyone else had meat and thoroughly enjoyed it all.  Tea was served with tea bags in the pot so you could have it as weak or strong as you liked.  The staff could't have been more helpful and attentive, we only had one waitress who didn't smile (perhaps she'd had a row with her boyfriend the night before!) and all spoke good English.  There are mixed nationalities in all the pubs and restaurants in Dublin as it is a very cosmopolitan city with many tourists, students and backpackers, just like London.  The concieges was very helpful and knowlegeable with directions etc (one was more smiley than the other I must admit, but both very efficient).

The leisure centre was lovely with pool sauna, spa, steam room, gym, sunbed and beauty rooms and I swam every day before breakfast (I can recommend this to work off all the food and Guiness you will consume!).  You have to wear swim hats but you do in any pool in Dublin.  We just thought it was a giggle and everyone wears them too so it doesn't seem odd at all.  At only 2.50 euros they make a fun souvenier as well! The only downside was that the drainage was blocked and the floors were waterlogged and dirty, so if you go do take flip flops.  However, the leisure centre is owned independently from the hotel.

To sum up, the hotel is rated only a 2-3 star and it is FAR FAR better than that; it is great value for money. I can highly recommend it and would book again. We all enjoyed ourselves and my husband had a great birthday.  All the people we met both in and out of the hotel went out of their way to be helpful and friendly.  Dublin is a great city to party in!
",4,2005,10,15
248,What country am I in?,"I really want to explain how bad the brekfast is here but words fail me. My sasauges were like tyres thick and tasted like rubber. Tea was like luke warm tap water and I would say the tea bag was just dipped into it and taken out again for the next pot. The egg - oh my god, Ive gone off eggs since what the hell is that all about?
The staff are in a world of their own I actually felt quite sorry for them not a word of English and they could not even converse with each other as they were all different nationalities.
The price was a complete rip - off. Will never go back again.
",1,2005,10,10
248,Not Great but Satisfied,"The hotel is located in a run-down section of Dublin. Our room view  was an abandoned building with broken windows. The parking is terrible, there is not enough room. The staff could be friendly and/or not depending on who is working. The consierge's were all very helpful. The food was good and the breakfasts were outstanding. The rooms would be considered very large by european standards. It's rated as a 3 star hotel and that's what you get.
",3,2005,08,14
248,Noisy hotel with a quite unfriendly staff,"I stayed in the hotel for two nights in August. The choice for this hotel was motivated by the closeness to the centre and the good reviews. The stay was disappointing: the hotel is a 15 minutes walk from the centre; the concierge was not able (or not willing) to get you information on buses that run to the centre. The hotel is very noisy: you hear every word from the neighbours. Furthermore, the hotel was full with full with people 60+, visiting Dublin by coach :-( The staff was generally unfriendly and not very helpful. So, if you are planning on going early to bed and getting up very early in the morning, and if you are sure not to need advise from the hotel staff, than this is a good price hotel to stay in Dublin.

The hotel is situated right in the city centre and is within walking distance of everything. I found the staff at reception very friendly and informative. The bar next door to the hotel was very lively and great fun. My bedroom was spacious and very comfortable.

I would whole heartly advise anyone to stay there as for comfort and location you wouldn't do much better..........",4,2005,07,04
248,"Excellent Hotel location, facilities and staff A1","Just a quick note

I am writing this on returning to Britain from the Camden Court Hotel in Dublin I stayed with a party of friends from France and the United States.
We enjoyed our stay so much that i just wanted to let all your readers know about this hotel we have stayed all over the World from New York to Dubai and really the staff here were excellent we were checked in by a girl fron the northern part of Ireland, she was most helpful. The front of house porters were also very helpful especially a guy called Dan - he was so helpful with booking Dinner, Tours and even a river dance type show all of which were excellent.  
The facilities included a leisure centre which on the saturday morning was undergoing essential maintance but we were informed  in advance so this 
was not a problem we decided to do a tour and when we returned all had been sorted out 

If staying in dublin check it out you will not be dissapointed 
What can one say -
 
a. I would return to dublin just to have the pleasure of staying in such a fine hotel

b. The main hotel bar was so different in design than any other i had been  to- just uniquely Irish with an excellent pint of the Guinness

C. Don`t just take my word for it , try it yourself
",5,2005,05,12
248,Butt City!! Easter 2005,"We stayed here over the Easter weekend, and found the hotel OK, but the location awful... Cigarette butts lined the main street from the hotel to the Temple Bar area, pools of vomit on the pavement were not uncommon, and the boarded up shops made us feel rather unsafe, especially as we had a child with us! Dublin is not a child friendly city, and appears generally shabby and rundown. The hotel was clean, staff friendly apart from a rather diffident concierge, but breakfast was only average with over cooked food, limited choices and waitresses who cleared your plates before you'd finished! The leisure centre facilities were very acceptable for a city centre location. Overall not a city or hotel I'd feel confident about recommending.
",2,2005,04,05
248,"Enjoyable stay, great location","I thought this hotel was really good value for money.  The room we had was quite large with a decent sized bathroom, the location is perfect as well, just a short walk to all the main shops in the centre, and a really nice italian restaurant we went to.  There was a pool, sauna, steam room and whirlpool which was an added bonus, and i found the staff very friendly.  For a 3 star hotel this is definately good value for money.
",4,2005,03,17
248,One of the most unwelcoming hotels ever stayed in,"We took a lot of care choosing the hotel for our one night in Dublin in October 2004, which was intended to round off a lovely tour of Wales and Ireland. The positive tripadvisor reviews led us to this one, but unfortunately our very mixed experiences of the establishment did not make this the expected highlight of the holiday.

The hotel itself was beautiful, quite well located, the room was lovely and the facilities were great. However, having wanted to swim (another reason for picking this place), we discovered that you had to have a swimming cap to wear in the pool, which on a brief one-night visit made this an obstacle we were not prepared to overcome (for the sake of other would-be swimmers, perhaps this requirement could be mentioned prominently in the hotel's details). The reception staff were cold and uninteretsed, not at all welcoming upon our arrival or thereafter. By contrast, the concierge and bar staff in the feature Piseogs bar were delightful and very helpful.  The breakfast experience was atrocious. We did not like the way the food was arbitrarily dished out in front of you, rather than allowing guests to serve themselves. The breakfast staff did not understand the simplest of requests. Although English was not their first language you would expect the hotel management to have ensured that they were sufficiently trained to provide the level of service required by this type of hotel, for which we had paid well to stay in. The tea provided was disgusting, and the twice-repeated request to replace it with a stronger cup resulted in an even worse, and weaker, 'brew'. A decent cuppa in the morning is, in fact, surprisingly difficult to obtain in many a hotel, but this took the biscuit.  

It is a shame that a hotel with such obvious potential is ruined in ways that it would not take much to put right, in order to make staying there a truly wonderful experience.  The attitude of the front-of-house staff, in particular, left us feeling immediately sooooo disappointed.

248,"excellent, good south city location","have stayed at the camden court a number of times while in dublin, pluses are itslocation, within easy walk of top of grafton street and around corner from new LUAS tram stop, rooms excellent, quiet despite location on busy street with many  restaurants nearby ( surma indian restaurant is good) bar downstairs not the best, but try 'bleeding horse' pub nearby for more atmosphere. Overall, would reccomend highly.
",5,2004,10,01
248,"Camden Court, Nice room but....","Just had a very enjoyable stay at the Camden Court and agree with most reviewers, but thought I'd add a couple of points not mentioned. At the end of the road (2mins) there is now a tram stop which will take you to the end of Grafton St. Very useful.
Secondly, when returning to the airport. DON'T use the service bus (16A) which stops just across the road unless you've got loads of time and enjoy crowded service buses that stop at every bus stop in Dublin. Although cheap, our trip took 1hr 15 mins (the reception desk suggested this bus) and although extremely cheap at 1.65 euro, terrible. The Aircoach takes approx 30-40 and is very comfortable although the stop is further away, a taxi between the hotel and nearest stop will cost approx 6-7 euro and the Aircoach itself 12euro return.
Only other gripe-the breakfast. Dining room dark and boring, staff unattentive, food only O.K 
Try the restaurant at the Leeson Court  (Kobar I think) on Lower Leeson St,about a 10 minute walk away. Lovely food (lunch), great decor. excellent attentive staff.

248,"Very Happy, Enjoyable, Contented Stay","We had a very enjoyable stay here in August! It was a 30th Birthday surprise - mid-week stay. The staff were very friendly and helpful. The concierge in particular was very accommodating with taxis etc. The swimming pool was a lovely added bonus and very relaxing after a long 'touristy' day. We arrived at 10am and were given a room instantly which was great, although Im sure this wouldn't be the case at the weekend. The rooms were very clean, pleasant, sparkly bathrooms. Average fittings, not shabby.The surrounding area isn't too pretty but a minutes walk will lead you to the Luas - The New Tram System. An absolute doddle to use and takes you intp St. Stephen's Green. I can highly highly recommend the hotel's restaurant, we were very surprised as we decided to go there as we were running late. Fabulous food, great service. Thank you very much, my boyfriend thoroughly enjoyed his birthday!

248,Great Staff,"I would like to thank the 3 night shift people that worked on April 25, 2004.  The night of 4/24 my husband and I received a call from home (New York) that my husbands mother pass away.  I immediately made airline reservations.  The morning of 4/25/04 at 5:00 am we came down to the lobby to check out and the men asked if they could get us breakfast. We didn't want to put them out. The dinning room wasn't open yet.  To our surprise they served us coffee, toast, and scones while we waited for the taxi. They even played some special Irish music since we didn't have time in the country to enjoy it ( we flew in on 4/23/04) . This meant a lot to us in our time of sorrow that people do care. We wish to come back to Ireland and I definitely want to stay at the Camden Court Hotel. 

The staff at the hotel was special.  

Thanks.",5,2004,05,10

248,Nice and Friendly,"Such a nice and friendly hotel. The rooms were clean and homely, but above all the friendliness of the staff really made our stay. The facilities such as the leisure centre were welcome additions. The Irish breakfast was wonderful. The walk into the city (10 mins) was just about right, besides there were excellent pubs and restaurants on the way to sidetrack you. Overall I wouldn't hesitate to go back.",4,2004,03,02
248,great value hotel,"Stayed at the Camden Court last week and thought it was excellent value as Dublin hotels are very expensive. Room was clean, breakfast was ok, although the girl serving the hot food had a ""face like thunder""! 
Walked to the Temple Bar area every night (got a taxi back though!) loads of lovely places to eat - spoilt for choice.

I also used the swimming pool, sauna, steam room etc. which was an added bonus as not many 3 star hotels have these facilities.

All in all, I would highly recommend this hotel.",4,2004,02,25
248,OK- but nothing special,"Stayed at the Camden Court this week thanks to the reviews posted on this site. The hotel is around the 3 star level, warm welcome, all the facilities (especially keep fit!) that you might need. Rooms are small and clean and ours had a strange smell in the bathroom (reported) but it did not spoil the stay. Restaurant only used for the (included) breakfast but, whilst a bit limited in choice, there was plenty of food available. I would not pay for the cooked breakfast if it was not included. Staff in restaurant not particularly friendly and one was on the mobile whilst serving hot food. The hotel is sited OK for St Stephens Green and Grafton Street but the area is a bit seedy and the walk from the centre not really enjoyable. Certainly Temple Bar is best visited by taxi. I think the charge (?375 for 2 nights) is extortionate but I'm told that Dublin hotels are expensive. We've stayed in Washington DC and Chicago for less!",3,2004,02,22
248,Great weekend spot,"We were very pleased with this hotel. We arrived early off a Ryan Air flight, hoping to just leave our luggage and they gave us our room. 
Rooms were clean and spacious, with a bathtub, not just a shower. No trouble at all with street noise- we slept very well. It's convenient walking distance from all the major sites. Breakfast seating was a bit slow in the morning, but they did have a huge crowd. Staff were pleasant and helpful.",4,2004,02,10
248,Good Value,"When planning our trip to Dublin, I had booked a room at the Best Western. But after reading the reviews for that hotel on TripAdvisor, I changed my mind and decided to look elsewhere (thanks!). The reviews that I had read for the Camden Court Hotel were bang on! The hotel was in a great location and it was very clean. Our room was a nice size with all the necessary amenities for a three star hotel. The breakfast was good quality and the hotel staff were very friendly. The concierge consistently recommended excellent places to eat and visit while in Dublin. The only complaint that I had was the noise at night. Our room faced onto the courtyard of the hotel and both nights we were awaken to the noise of either drunken people screaming or laundry being delivered at the crack of dawn. Other than that, I would highly recommend this hotel.",4,2004,02,07

A lovely modern, clean and luxurious place to stay - 5 mins walk from Grafton street. Has a great gym and pool, and secure free car parking. 
Breakfast fairly average. We have stayed in many of Dublin's hotels, including the 5 star ones. This is the all-round winner!",5,2003,11,16
248,Nothing wrong with modern hotels,Took my wife on a birthday treat weekend to Dublin in October 2003.Stayed two nights at this modern but very friendly hotel. A few steps further out of the heart of the city than you might wish especially after a few pints of the black nectar. Big reception area and pleasant Piseogs bar. Good leisure complex; almost boiled in the jacuzzi! All the staff had big welcoming smiles and everything very clean. Would stay there again without hesitation,5,2003,10,14
248,Within walking distance of best parts of Dublin,"We're from Dublin, having left in 1999. Whenever we get home for a holiday, the Camden Court is our hotel of choice. Its located at the top of Camden Street, and is a brisk walk (i.e.1 mile or about 15 minutes) from Grafton St and Stephen's Green. Due to its location (in what used to be a seedier area of the city) the hotel is close to the South Circular Road which leads to a convenient moterway hub for getting in and out of the city. We use the Caden Court as a base for trips down to Waterford, out to Galway and up to Cavan. The hotel itself is clean and tidy. The rooms are small-ish by US standards but adequately appointed. The price can be expensive (as is usual for Dublin hotels) but its a good idea to shop around on the internet for better rates than the hotel itself can offer.",5,2003,08,01
248,Great,"I stayed at this hotel in July 2000, and it was great. The location is about 1/2 mile away from Temple bar, but it is a nice walk! Make sure to request a non-smoking room if you are not a smoker! The smoking rooms here are very intense!",5,2003,07,26
248,Lovely Hotel,"Stayed at Camden Court 2 nights in April,2002 with a tour group. Great fascillities (pool, lounge, reception area) and clean, nice rooms. Wonderful location in walking distance to most everything in Dublin.
",4,2002,10,31
248,A really great hotel (for every occasion),"We stayed at the Camden Court Hotel for 3 days. The room faced the street and was a family room and despite there being a family with children next door, it was super quiet in the room. The bed was super comfortable and the room was well equipped, and there was no room for complaint about the cleanliness either. We were more than happy to have chosen this hotel. 
The staff were also super friendly and the wellness area and the gym were really well equipped and never overcrowded despite the hotel being fully booked. 

In addition, I had planned to propose in Ireland and therefore contacted the guest service and was really thrilled with everything that was offered to me, how the communication went and how I could rely on everything - thank you again for that.",5,2024,05,05
248,Negative experience,"4 star hotel that doesn't even deserve 2. Hard pillows, more than half an hour away from the centre, and, last but not least... broken heating in the room which they tried to remedy with an 80's radiator. Only the second night a room change was offered at 10pm. We were guaranteed a gluten-free breakfast but from a 4-star hotel I would have expected something more than bread and jam. 50 meters away there are several supermarkets with a vast choice of gluten-free products where stock up. Sometimes you get lost in a glass of water. Honestly not recommended",1,2024,03,06
248,Recommended hotel near the old town,"Well located, typical Irish hotel, a little dated, very busy, lots of tour groups, very friendly staff, pleasant rooms, very good food, only a short walk to the city centre, good pubs in the vicinity of the hotel",4,2023,09,06
248,A few minutes from the center,"Good hotel near Temple Bar and Trinity College (both on foot and with 2 Luas stops on the green line) near the Harcourt stop where the Dublin Express to the airport also leaves
Quiet and safe area
Room with queen bed, modern and clean, bathroom with tub with curtain
Coffee machine with pods in the room
Friendly and helpful staff who also speak Italian
We did not try the restaurant",5,2023,08,25
248,"Ok, aber schlechter als erwartet","Sehr gute Lage, alles fussläufig zu erreichen. Zimmer sind angemessen für den Preis in Dublin, sehr sauber. Frühstück leider enttäuschend und nicht sauber. Keine frischen Omelettes, alles etwas lieblos präsentiert. 
Wer hier großen Komfort erwartet wird enttäuscht sein. Dann lieber tiefer in die Tasche greifen und im Durchschnitt ab 300€ für ein Zimmer pro Nacht ausgeben. ",3,2023,04,16
248,Ottima posizione,"Hotel situato in ottima posizione. A pochi minuti a piedi sei in centro. Proprio di fronte c’è la fermata del pullman che porta all’aeroporto. Zona carina con molti locali e ristoranti. A due passi ci sono un paio di mini market. 
Consigliato!",5,2023,02,05
248,Schönes Hotel für Dublin-Trip,"Das Hotel liegt sehr zentral und man erreicht alle Sehenswürdigkeiten in Dublin sehr schnell. Die Tram-Station ist nicht weit.
Der Service ist gut - allerdings wurde ein bestellter Sektempfang für die Gruppe verpennt - man hat sich aber schnell bemüht.
Das Essen und der Service im Restaurant sind sehr gut und auch beim Frühstücksbuffet ist für jeden etwas dabei. Die Zimmer sind geräumig und sehr sauber.",4,2022,07,15
248,Sehr schönes Hotel mitten in Dublin!,"Die Lage vom Hotel ist sehr zentral. Von dort aus erreicht man die Pubs auf schnellstem Weg. Das Zimmer was sehr sauber und wir haben es sehr geschätzt das der Check-Out erst um 12.00 Uhr war. Die Mitarbeiter sind alle sehr freundlich und zuvorkommend, wenn man ein Taxi benötigt oder Fragen hat helfen Sie gerne weiter. Unbedingt das Frühstück dazu buchen, es hat eine riesen Auswahl und ist sehr lecker. Wir kommen aufjedenfall wieder ins Camden Court!!!",5,2022,04,23
248,Consigliato,"abbiamo soggiornato 3 notti ed è stato un buon soggiorno. L'hotel è ben curato, le camere abbastanza ampie e spaziose e ottima la pulizia. Ottima anche la posizione, a 15 min a piedi da temple bar e ben collegato con l'aeroporto (10 min a piedi dalla fermata del 700 Leeson Street Lower). Bello anche il pub subito sotto. Lo consiglio",4,2022,03,30
248,Schönes Hotel,"Das Hotel ist sehr schön, die Lage und das Personal samt Service war super! Die Lage des Hotel hat uns super gefallen, zu Fuß war man in 20min in der Stadt, auch eine Bushaltestelle ist direkt gegen über.
Zimmer sehr groß und geräumig, auch das Bad. Leider wurde unser Zimmer währen des Aufenthalts nicht geputzt, es wurde nur das Bett gemacht und die Handtücher gewechselt, obwohl diese nicht am Boden lagen.
Preislich sehr teuer.",3,2022,01,06
248,Senza lode senza infamia ,"Abbiamo pernottato 4 notti per capodanno, hall carina personale  gentile.
Le camere sono piccole e con la moquet, dovrebbero ristrutturare sia le camere che il corridoio (Piano 2), infatti all’arrivo la receptionist si è scusata per le condizione del corridoio, dicendo che stavano per fare dei lavori.
La zona è a 15 min a piedi dal centro, seno’ ci sono i mezzi vicini.
Colazione abbondante e buona, un po’ troppo irish sarebbero gradite delle torte, ogni giorno facevano un succo salutare davvero ottimo!
La palestra è grande e attrezzata, sauna e piscina con idromassaggio grandi  ma un po’ angusti, ci vorrebbe piu’ pulizia negli spogliatoi.
Dipende l’offerta che trovate, 150€ a notte attualmente non li vale.",3,2020,01,12
248,Good stay,"Buona posizione per raggiungere i principali luoghi di interesse, sia con il tram che con i bus, capolinea Airlink di fronte all’hotel.
Camere spaziosa e pulita.
Personale professionale e disponibile per ogni richiesta.",4,2020,01,03
248,Relacion calidad precio es absolutamente desproporcionado,"El hotel está bien. La situacion es medianamente buena. Las habitaciones no son grandes, pero tampoco pequeñas. Son casi todas interiores, Dan a un patio interior. El parking cuesta 10€ diarios. El wifi no conseguimos que funcionara. La ducha no salía agua caliente, pero lo arreglaron posteriormente. Solo hay 2 ascensores y cerca de 50 habitaciones por planta, por lo cual a algunas horas del dia es practicamente imposible cogerlo. No tomamos desayuno, costaba 13€. La television solo es de canales normales. El problema máximo de todos estos comentarios es que la noche para 3 salio por cerca de 250€ sin desayuno. No lo vale. Ni se aproxima a ello. NI siquiera puede parecerlo.",2,2019,10,15
248,Excelente ubicación,"la verdad que no es el hotel que elegimos inicialmente, pero nos derivaron a él, por motivos ajenos a nosotros, y quedamos encantadas. Trato genial, desayuno completo y variado, y lo mejor cercanía al centro y paradas de bus, para poder moverte por la ciudad o desplazarte al aeropuerto. ",4,2019,10,09
248,Hotel da consigliare,L'hotel è in una posizione ottima per muoversi con i mezzi. Ci ho soggiornato per lavoro e non ho avuto tempo di visitare la spa e la piscina ma il resto dell'hotel è molto gradevole. Pulito ed organizzato. Il personale è molto gentile e la qualità della colazione è davvero ottima. Da consigliare!,4,2019,08,31
248,BUON HOTEL,"Hotel in pieno centro di Dublino.
Camera ampia, spaziosa e pulita… Unica pecca la camera dava su una strada trafficata e la notte si sentivano rumori.

Macchinetta caffe'/cappuccini a disposizione.

Recomendable Hotel.",4,2019,07,22

248,Hotel comodissimo,"Sono stata in questo hotel per un soggiorno di tre giorni.
La camera era pulita, munita di bollitore, macchina del caffè, ferro da stiro e ventilatore. La colazione molto ricca e varia (potete scegliere tra pietanze della irish breakfast e quelle della colazione continentale). Gli orari per la colazione (7:00-10:30) ed il check-out (entro le 12:00) sono molto comodi.
Il centro di Dublino è comodamente raggiungibile a piedi, sotto all'hotel c'è il pub ""The bleeding Horse"" (frequentato anche dagli stessi irlandesi) e lì vicino c'è il capolinea del bus che porta in aeroporto...comodissimo insomma!",4,2019,06,10
248,Soggiorno speciale,"Io e mio marito abbiamo soggiornato per due notti in questo Hotel. La posizione è fantastica: esattamente di fronte alla fermata del bus per l'aeroporto e a 7/8 minuti di cammino dalla cattedrale di Saint Patrick. L'hotel si trova sopra uno dei pub più antichi di Dublino e, essendo arrivati di sera e mentre pioveva, abbiamo potuto gustarci una serata irlandese senza muoverci affatto.
L'hotel é carino e ben curato nell'aspetto esterno. La colazione è ottima e abbondante, sia nel dolce che nel salato. Unica pecca è stata la biacheria del letto che in un punto era logora e in un altro macchiata. Ultima cosa, ma molto personale, io toglierei la moquette.",4,2019,04,29
248,Nettes Hotel,"Geräumiges komfortables Zimmer, sehr gutes Frühstück. Zu Fuss und auch mit öffentlichen Verkehrsmitteln erreicht man innerhalb kurzer Zeit die City. Bar schön, Abendessen gut.

Lo mejor: la situación del hotel, muy céntrico, y la cama ¡solo podía levantarnos una ciudad tan bonita como Dublín! El personal muy agradable, un día nos prepararon un desayuno para llevar porque teníamos que salir pronto antes de la hora del desayuno. El día de salida nos guardaron las maletas. Daban ganas de estar más tiempo allí, pero un fin de semana no da para mucho... ¡Lo recomendamos! :)",5,2018,12,04
248,Una semana en Dublin. Todo perfecto,He pasado una semana en éste hotel por motivos profesionales. Opción más que acertada para conocer o trabajar en Dublin. Hotel cómodo y céntrico. Personal amable y cortés siempre dispuesto a agradar. Bien comunicado con el Aeropuerto mediante la línea 757 de autobús.  Genial desayuno y un buen descubrimiento sus restaurantes.   Enclavado en una zona con comercios y buena opción de ocio nocturno tradicional irlandés.  Volveremos,4,2018,11,07
248,Dublino che passione,"Ho trascorso 3 notti in questo hotel con mio marito e la nostra bimba di 5 anni. La posizione, arrivando alla sera del sabato, si è rivelata ottima, in una via molto animata tra locali, ristoranti e negozietti, anke alcuni alimentari molto particolari e belli che per acqua, frutta e necessità varie sono davvero comodi, tra l altro chiudono tardi. L hotel è grande molto ben tenuto, una grande hall, le camere spaziose e ben dotate: phon, set cortesia, macchinetta caffè con cialde, cassaforte e tutti i giorni 2 bottigliette d acqua, gasata e non. Buona pulizia, c è la moquette ma nn si sente odore polvere come in certi hotel dove sono stata. Lo staff è molto gentile, c è una piscina ad uso gratuito se avete un oretta libera approfittate è molto rilassante. Buona la colazione c è scelta per tutti i gusti, dolce e salato.. io aggiungerei una tortina o plum-cake e della cioccolata spalmabile ma comunque e’ Già molto ricca. Tornando alla posizione prete tranquillamente girare la città a piedi. Se avete il sonno leggero chiedete le camere interne ma comunque questo hotel ve lo super consiglio per il vostro soggiorno a Dublino. Buon viaggio.",4,2018,09,03
248,pro e contro,"l'hotel non è centrale, ma dista 2 km da temple bar.
la strada è trafficata, qualche pub e basta nei dintorni
niente aria condizionata, stanze caldissime!
ottima la colazione, dolce e salata
parcheggio mini",3,2018,08,13
248,Ricordo di Dublino nostalgico.,"Hotel accogliente ed in buona posizione semicentrale. Stanze pulite, colazione internazionale ben assortita e ristorante
Con buona cucina. Per chi si reca per la prima volta a Dublino va consigliato certamente anche per l’ottimo rapporto qualità e prezzo!!!",4,2018,08,05
248,Bustouristen,"Dies ist ein Hotel für Bustouristen und da ich selber einer bin, sollte ich mich nicht beschweren. 
Alleine unterwegs würde ich hier nie buchen: laut, an einer verkehrsreichen Strasse gelegen (Fenster offen lassen unmöglich) 80iger Jahre Einrichtung ohne irisches Flair, kein Air Conditioning, nicht wirklich zentral gelegen (20 Minuten Marsch vom Trinity College), kurz nicht empfehlenswert.",3,2018,07,29

248,hotel di classe nel centro di Dublino,"Hotel di classe superiore, con camere ampie (ottimo il bagno), prima colazione veramente irlandese, molto ricca, ampi spazi comuni, piscina, il tutto in zona centralissima, ottimamente insonorizzato, per cui i molti rumori delle starde intorno trafficate e dei pub non giungono nelle camere.",4,2018,07,14
248,"Gutes, ruhiges Hotel","Wir hatten zwei verschiedene Zimmer, beide Male zu einem Hinterhof hinaus.Das erste Zimmer war perfekt: zwei riesige Betten, ein großzügiges Bad, einen ruhigen Hof. Das zweite Zimmer ging auch auf einen Hof, jedoch war dort eine laute Lüftung, die doch störend war. Insgesamt war das Zimmer auch kleiner, das Bad eng, und die Betten sehr viel schmaler. Man sollte sich vorher die Zimmer ansehen. Das Frühstück war sehr gut, wenn auch die Frage nach ""hot milk"" für den Milchkaffe nicht immer richtig verstanden wurde. Das Schwimmbad nach einem heissen (!) Tag in Dublin war traumhaft - wir haben es sehr genossen. Ich würde wieder in dieses Hotel gehen, da es auch fußläufig gut liegt.",5,2018,07,03
248,Ottima scelta,"Ampio, con begli spazi comuni, camere non enormi ma confortevoli, pulite, fornite di ogni attrezzatura (asse da stiro, ventilatore, macchina caffè espresso, macchina caffe americano, phon nel cassetto. Comodi i materassi.

Consigliato se non si trova altro.",3,2018,06,23
248,Urlaub ,"Hatten ein Zimmer im 5.Stock. Bei wärmerem Wetter heizt das Zimmer mächtig auf, weil keine Klimaanlage vorhanden ist (warme Tage sind hier wohl die Ausnahme). Der Service ist sehr freundlich und das Frühstück war prima. Obwohl das Hotel ziemlich groß ist, merkte man dies beim Frühstück nicht. Das Zimmer verfügte sogar über ein Bügeleisen zzgl Bügelbrett, was ich schon ungewöhnlich fand. Die Lage des Hotels ist nicht völlig zentral. Um in die City zu gelangen, sollte man einen Fußweg von ca. 20 Minuten einplanen oder einen der zahlreichen Busse vor der Tür benutzen. Optimal ist die Verkehrsanbindung an den Flughafen über den sog. Airlink Express, ein Bus, der direkt vor dem Hotel hält. ",4,2018,05,09
248,Buono il primo pernottamento - Scadente il secondo,"Vi abbiamo pernottato 2 notti non consecutive.
Il  giudizio per la prima notte è più che positivo, peccato che per la seconda non ci si possa ripetere.
Infatti la stanza assegnataci ( nr. 601 ) non è all' altezza dell' Hotel poichè il bagno è
senza riscaldamento con tubazioni rumorose e scarichi ingorgati.

248,Ottimo hotel!,"La stanza riservataci era spaziosa e molto pulita, dotata di tv, phon (nel cassetto). Nonostante fossimo vicini agli ascensori non li abbiamo minimamente sentiti durante la notte. Il bagno altrettanto pulito e spazioso.
Personale alla reception gentile e disponibile. Non abbiamo provato la colazione poichè impegnati con dei tour sin dalla mattina molto presto.
Davanti all'hotel c'è la fermata dell'autobus 757 che arriva/porta in aeroporto in 25/30 minuti. Il centro (zona Temple Bar) è raggiiungibile a piedi in 15 minuti. La zona in cui è posizionato l'hotel era tranquilla e sicura.

El desayuno normalito,  no hay aceite de oliva ni de ningún tipo, y poca variedad. La habitación aceptable, sin mini bar,el secador de pelo enchufado en el armario (no se puede quitar) y no hay espejo donde mirarte mientras te secas el pelo, el baño aceptable, pero con muy poca luz.

248,delusione,"Bisognerebbe poter dare due giudizi separati: uno sull' albergo e uno sulla ristorazione. Le stanze e i servizi relativi sono al top: non ho notato mancanze anche se non ho aperto il frigobar. Discorso diverso per la cena: mezza fetta di salmone affumicato su un ""lettino"" di insalate varie non può essere definito uno ""starter"" ma solo un piccolo stuzzichino per il resto nella media. Altro problema la durata della cena dalle 20  alle 10,30 abbondanti che  per il menu che abbiamo avuto è troppo. Se effettivamente e Franco Rosso a stabilire i menu ( e non l' hotel) sarà meglio che prendano seri provvedimenti.",2,2017,08,18
248,Posizione e stile al top!,"La posizione è perfetta, a due passi da Grafton Street e dal St. Stephen Green, e l'arredamento dell'hotel è in stile boutique, molto bello, sia la reception che le camere. Servizio buono, ristorazione un po' deludente, ma tutto sommato un bell'hotel.",4,2017,08,13
248,Tolles Stadthotel in Dublin,"Wir waren für 2 Nächte in diesem Hotel und hatten ein sehr schönes und ruhiges hofseitiges Zimmer. Besonders hervorzuheben ist das schöne und große Badezimmer und die tollen Betten. Wir haben wirklich sehr gut geschlafen. Das Hotel liegt sehr zentral, das Personal war sehr freundlich und zuvorkommend und mit dem Frühstücksbuffet waren wir auch sehr zufrieden. Leider war im Juli sehr viel los (Reisegruppen) und daher war es schon um 7 Uhr früh sehr laut im Frühstücksraum und dementsprechend viel los.",4,2017,07,25
248,Muchissimo ruido,"Hoel moderno, con piscina, las habitaciones estan bien, y no mal situado un poco lejos del centro unos 20 minutos a pie. El problema es el ruido, las habitaciones no estan insonorizadas y esta en una calle con mucho trafico por la noche te despiertas y parece que la gente habla dentro de la habitacion. Cuando pasa una ambulancion es un horror, la slarmas de las tendas... imposible dormir. PErsonales no muy amable, nos quejamos y la resuesta fue eso es porque esta en el centro.... Muchisimos hoteles estan en el centro y no se oye nada.... Dijeron que nos contactaria el manager y hasta hoy que supongo que contestarà en tripadvisor... Una pena porque el hotel esta bien",3,2017,07,20
248,Sosta di una notte,"Prima tappa del tour della Francorosso Bellezze d'Irlanda. Mi ha infastidito subito il menù della cena con due sole scelte di antipasti (insalata o zuppa) e di seconda portata (pollo o pancetta) e nessuna possibilità di mangiare un frutto al posto del dolce da scegliere tra torta al limone e torta di mele. Devo dire però che il pollo ( mangiato poi per sei sere anche negli altri hotel!) era molto buono ed anche il resto. La colazione fissata alle 7.45, senza possibilità di anticipare,  è un'altra cosa che mi ha infastidito. Però poi, scesa alle 7.15, sono stata accolta dal personale con gentilezza ed ho usufruito di una colazione faraonica dove non mancava proprio nulla né di dolce né di salato, né di frutta. Quindi la mia deduzione è che la Francorosso fissa i menù e gli orari mentre l'hotel è e sarebbe sicuramente più elastico.
La camera assegnataci era piccola ma confortevole, senza aria condizionata che peraltro non serviva, il bagno privo di aspirazione e senza phon.  (negli altri hotel il phon è in un cassetto. In previsione di bagni ciechi e senza aspirazione mi porto sempre degli incensi. Nell'armadio asse e ferro da stiro e scaldaacqua con fornitura completa di tè, caffè e biscottini. Mi sono trovata bene, in un ambiente signorile e classico a pochi passi dal centro di Dublino e se dovessi tornare a Dublino ci tornerei con la certezza che non si serve solo pollo!",4,2017,07,06
248,Empfehlung,"Wir waren für ein verlängertes Wochenende in diesem Hotel. Es ist sehr zentral gelegen, das Personal war sehr zuvorkommend und freundlich. Zimmer , Frühstück u die Lobby waren sehr schön.

Buona illuminazione. Ci sono termosifoni e vedo un ventilatore. Deduco che la stanza non è climatizzata, si patirà il caldo in estate. Wi-Fi ok è gratis. TV kc/s. Colazione di ottima qualità e abbondante. Dolce salato frutta

Ha un reparto ""Leisure"" come lo chiamano loro, ossia dotato di due saune e una grande piscina. La camera ed il bagno erano giusti, ossia ne troppo grandi ne troppo piccoli. Il letto molto comodo ed il personale uno più gentile dell'altro. Ottima la colazione che offre di tutto e di più! Vivamente raccomandato!

Unica pecca il wifi molto lento nella stanza, nessun problema invece nella hall.",4,2017,04,11

248,"Se torno a Dublino, ritorno qui. ","Ho soggiornato qui quattro notti. La posizione dell'albergo e' buona, a pochi minuti a piedi dal centro, e proprio di fronte c'e' la fermata per l'autobus 757 per l'aeroporto. Check in veloce. La camera e' abbastanza spaziosa, bene arredata, con TV a grande schermo smart.  Pulita, con letto comodo e, finalmente, con cuscini degni di tal nome. Bene anche il bagno, pero' grave pecca, manca l'asciugacapelli. In compenso c'e' l'asse da stiro (curiose priorita': io in vacanza mi lavoro pure i capelli pero' non stiro). Ci sarebbe stata anche la macchinetta del n espresso ma la mia non funzionava. Ho avuto una camera silenziosa che dava su una corte interna. Fantastica la zona fitness relax: palestra ben attrezzata, piscina da 16 m (quindi nuotabile), piccola piscina per bambini, sauna e bagno turco. L'ho goduta appieno.  Ho utilizzato anche il ristorante dell'hotel: non a buon mercato, ma cucina di livello molto buono. Quindi , ribadisco, esperienza positiva. Note negative: l'asciugacapelli assente e il personale della reception non proprio simpaticissimo...",4,2017,02,20
248,Gutes Hotel,"Sehr gutes Hotel an perfekter Lage.

Zimmer sind sauber. Das Personal ist sehr freundlich. 
Frühstücksbuffet ist sehr reichhaltig und vielfältig. 
Würde dieses Hotel jederzeit wieder buchen. ",4,2017,02,18
248,Yesss!!!,"Giudizio pienamente positivo con possibilità di miglioramento:
- posizione ottima, a poche centinaia di metri dal vero centro, culturale e turistico; 
- camera spaziosa e confortevole ma non silenziosissima, anche per la presenza di un frequentatissimo pub sotto l'hotel;
- colazione abbondante ma non ricca per varietà, tre tipi di croissants, pane, molte marmellate, cereali ma niente torte o biscotti, insomma dolci secchi ecc., ma soprattutto piuttosto cara, 8,50 euro.",4,2016,12,29
248,Buon hotel per viaggi d'affari (e non solo),"Ho soggiornato per due notti in questo albergo. La posizione è buona, a circa 10-15 minuti a piedi dal centro. La struttura è principalmente rivolta ai viaggiatori business: non si tratta di un hotel caratteristico, ma dallo stile elegante e sobrio. Camera spaziosa e bagno molto bello, dotato di asciugamani, bagnoschiuma, shampoo e creme varie. Buona la colazione, con scelta di tantissime opzioni continentali e da ""English Breakfast"". L'unica nota negativa è stato il WiFi in camera, nel mio caso al terzo piano, che andava molto lento. Ma probabilmente è stato un caso, anche confrontandomi con gli altri ospiti che viaggiavano con me in altre camere non hanno riscontrato questo problema. Consigliato per viaggi di lavoro, meno se cercate un albergo caratteristico, ma rimane comunque valido anche per viaggi di piacere.",4,2016,12,19
248,Un buen hotel para ser Dublin,"El hotel esta muy bien, de los mejores en los que hes estado. Es muy caro, pero asi son todos los hoteles en Dublin, por lo menos este esta bien. El desayuno es caro pero muy bueno. Esta en pleno centro con zona de pubs alrededor",4,2016,11,24
248,Mittelklasse zum fairen Preis,"Zum ersten Mal in Dublin war das Hotel schon mal ein guter Start. Zentral gelegen, sauber, ohne Renovierungsstau, mit sehr freundlichem Personal und reichhaltigem Frühstück. Kann das Hotel unbedingt weiterempfehlen.
Trotz kühler Außentemperatur und offenem Fenster waren unsere Zimmer nachts etwas zu warm; meckern auf hohem Niveau.",4,2016,11,01
248,Gutes Hotel in der Innenstadt,"Wir waren für ein Wochenende in Dublin und haben uns das Camden Court Hotel ausgesucht weil es recht zentral liegt und wir ein Wochenendpaket inkl. Frühstück und Abendessen buchen konnten. Direkt vorm Hotel hält der Bus zum Flughafen - vom Flughafen sind es ca 30-40 min bis zum Hotel. Vom Hotel aus läuft man in ca 15 min in die Innenstadt, nach Temple Bar und zum Guinness Storehouse. Wir wurden freundlich empfangen und die Zimmer waren sehr sauber und recht modern eingerichtet. Wir waren im 6. Stock und hatten einen tollen Blick über Dublin (Zimmer 611). Was uns überrascht hat: Frühstück auf dem Zimmer ist kostenlos - man zahlt nur eine Servicegebühr. Frühstücksbuffet im Hotel ist aber auch sehr gut. Wir haben beides ausprobiert und waren zufrieden. Insgesamt ist das Hotel für ein Wochenende zu Zweit zu empfehlen. ",4,2016,10,23
248,Sobrevalorado,"Lo mejor el servicio, queriendo agradar. Muchas cosas a mejorar; hotel viejuno, decadente. Sin minibar, el wifi es de broma, sin secador del pelo, moqueta vieja, almohadas súper duras y difícil acceso al parking. Las zonas comunes decentes; el precio no es acorde al hotel.",1,2016,10,21
248,Hotel centrico y moderno,"Hotel agradable, no muy céntrico pero tranquilo, habitaciones limpias con baño completo, el desayuno en bufet libre es mas que correcto.

248,Confortable y miderno,"Hotel un pelin alejado de la zona de Temple Bar pero a solo una parada en el tranvía de la zona de Grafton Street y multitud de buses con mucha frecuencia que en 3-4 paradas te llevan al centro 

El hotel es moderno lo que es de resaltar. Limpio y cómodo. Buen wifi y agradables y grandes zonas comunes. 

Buena atención de recepción y dispuesto a Ayudar y orientar.

Recomendable aunque sea algo superior de precio pero se ajusta al estándar español lo que es una tranquilidad para futuros viajeros

248,Brevissimo soggiorno,"Questo è stato probabilmente l'albergo del tour che ho preferito, peccato essersi fermati pochissimo, dalle 17:30 alle 3 di notte. Peccato anche non aver provato la piscina ed il servizio ristorazione. Bella la camera e soprattutto il bagno, con shampoo, balsamo, bagnoschiuma e crema corpo.
La posizione rispetto al centro città mi è sembrata buona.",4,2016,09,08
248,Mittelklassehotel,"Wir übernachteten dort 3 Nächte im Rahmen einer Studienreise. Nicht direkt an der Fußgängerzone gelegen, aber 
laufen möglich. Restaurant und Frühstücksraum dunkel. Unser Zimmer zum Innenhof war einigermaßen ruhig (Ausnahme Wochenende). Leider befand sich unter unserem Zimmer ein Gebläse, welches auch die ganze Nacht lief. Das Gebäude gegenüber war die ganze Nacht beleuchtet und das Licht schien in unser Zimmer. Keine Einhebelmischer am Waschbecken. Bad klein. Essen im Restaurant ganz ok.",3,2016,09,08
248,Un quattro stelle... business style,"Mentre in tutta l'Irlanda sono rimasto stupito, quasi imbarazzato, dalla gentilezza e dalla cortesia del personale di alberghi, ristoranti, negozi... ecco l'eccezione che conferma la regola. Qui siamo stati trattati con normalità. Non male, assolutamente, ma in modo freddo e distaccato, come negli alberghi ""per lavoro"" dove l'afflusso è tale da rendere un sorriso evento raro. Piccolezze, ma dovrebbero spiegarmi cosa ci sta a fare  il valet all'entrata se poi la macchina te la devi parcheggiare tu (noi avevamo difficoltà sia per la guida a sx che per le dimensioni del furgone noleggiato). La fitness rooom aperta solo dalle 8 durante i week-end. Una sola chiave consegnata all'arrivo. Corridoi dei piani molto, molto basici. Interni delle camere invece puliti e ben arredati. Assurdo trovare un ventilatore nell'armadio... ma noi d'altronde non siamo riusciti a trovare il pannello dell'AC; quindi finestra aperta e tanto rumore dalla strada. In conclusione: per lavoro va benissimo, se invece volete assaggiare la cordialità irlandese, non ritengo sia questo il posto.",3,2016,08,24
248,Super tolles städte-trip-hotel,"Lage:ruhig und trotzdem in 10 min in der fussgängerzone

248,Eher ein 3-Sterne Hotel,"Das Hotel ist zentral gelegen und hat eine gute Verkehrsverbindung zum Flughafen (30 Minuten mit dem Bus), die Haltestelle befindet sich direkt vor dem Hotel. Die Innenstadt und viele Sehenswürdigkeiten sind fußläufig erreichbar. Das Hotel selbst ist eher durchschnittlich und auch schon etwas in die Jahre gekommen. 
Erster Eindruck und Zimmer: Die etwas ältere Einrichtung des Hotels empfanden wir als recht charmant, es passt einfach zu Dublin und wirkt authentisch. Jedoch haben wir in allen Bereichen die Liebe zum Detail in einem vier Sterne Haus vermisst. Der Check-in war sachlich und zügig. Unser Zimmer war im dritten Stock mit Blick zum Hinterhof, keine schöne Aussicht, aber ruhig. Das Inventar wie gesagt etwas älter und mit Gebrauchsspuren aber charmant. Jedoch lagen Kabel lose herum, das Briefpapier war ganz zerknittert, die Roomservicekarte unangenehm klebrig, die Lampe neben dem Bett mit einem ekligen (Blut?)Fleck und die Spiegel im Bad verschmiert. Es gibt leider nur Shampoo, Duschgel und Lotion, jedoch auch auf Nachfrage an der Rezeption keinen Conditoner. Mein Partner fragte nach einem Rasierer, der gebracht werden sollte laut Rezeption, das wurde dann aber einfach vergessen. Beim zweiten Versuch bekam er direkt an der Rezeption einen Rasierer. 
Der Wellnessbereich: Ebenfalls sehr in die Jahre gekommen, aber auch hier wäre es nicht so schlimm, wenn Sauberkeit und Ausstattung gestimmt hätten. Die Umkleidekabine, WC und Duschen waren nicht besonders hygienisch. Schimmel in den Fugen und es roch stark nach Urin. Das Schwimmbecken selber war sehr stark gechlort, es gab vier einfache Plastikliegen ohne Auflagen. Es lagen feuchte, zerknitterte Zeitungen herum. Von Wellness oder Erholung kann leider nicht die Rede sein, wirklich eine Enttäuschung. 
Essen und Trinken: Das Restaurant war wenig besucht, bietet eine gute Auswahl an Speisen. Glutenfreie Gerichte waren auch kein Problem. Wir haben tolle irische Steaks bestellt, eines ""rare"" und eines ""medium"", leider wurden beide ""well-done"" serviert. Das war angesichts der tollen Qualität des Fleisches wirklich schade. Das Frühstücksbuffet war im Vergleich zu deutschen Buffets dieser Hotelkategorie wirklich klein. Die Servicekraft fragte uns nach Kaffeewünschen, als ich nach Cappuccino fragte hieß es: Wir servieren nur Kaffee oder Tee, Kaffeespezialitäten müssen Sie sich selber holen."" Das ist nicht der zuvorkommende Service den wir uns in dieser Preisklasse gewünscht hätten. Alles in allem wirklich Schade...",3,2016,08,01
248,Tour ,"Bell'albergo  nei pressi della cattedrale di S.Patrick e di S.Jesus Christ.

Di notte la strada è rumorosa ma siamo nella Dublino più vecchia

248,Consigliatissimo!,"Situato in centro a Dublino, le camere sono spaziose, confortevoli e pulite. La colazione, più che abbondante, presenta una vasta gamma di pietanze salate e dolci (comprese le brioches, che in genere in Irlanda non sono presenti nei buffet del mattino).
Buono anche il ristorante presente nella struttura.
Il personale è stato molto gentile e competente.
Davvero un ottimo hotel.",5,2016,07,24
248,Hotel perfecto para descansar en Dublín,"Es la segunda vez que me alojo en este hotel en Dublín, la primera con la familia, y la segunda por trabajo, y lo recomiendo sin dudarlo. Tanto si es por placer como por trabajo, después de pasear por la ciudad o trabajar todo el dia, es fantástico relajarse en la zona de SPA, y gimnasio del Hotel. La situación no es mala, aunque hay que caminar unos 10 minutos para llegar al centro, pero se agradece el paseo. El personal es correcto, sin nada que destacar en positivo ni negativo. Lo mejor es que se duerme bien, y la zona de aguas. Al lado justo está el Bleeding Horse, que se agradece para tomar una buena Guiness fresquita en un ambiente típico Irlandés.",4,2016,07,16
248,Molto bello!,"Hotel moderno, pulito e in centro! Circondato da pub e negozi questo albergo offre tutti i servizi. Stanze silenziose nonostante la zona frequentata! Colazione ottima molto variegata e con le marmellate in piccoli vasetti di vetro! Tutto ottimo!",5,2016,06,09

Facilmente raggiungibile il centro a piedi, la zona è tranquilla, le camere silenziose.
Ho provato anche l'area leisure con jacuzzi, swimming pool e sauna. Il costume se non lo si ha in valigia si può acquistare direttamente in hotel.
wifi veloce e disponibile in ogni punto della struttura, un po scomodo solo per il fatto che ogni volta richiede l'inserimento della password.
La colazione è ricca, international.
Il personale cordiale e sorridente.",4,2016,04,17
248,Elegante y con amplias habitaciones,"Ubicado en la zona sur de Dublín, con gran variedad de sitios interesantes de ver, como el barrio georgiano.

248,Splendido!!,"Splendido hotel nelle vicinanze del centro: le strade dello shopping e dei parchi distano solo 10' a piedi. Hotel con grandi spazi comuni, camere molto grandi e confortevoli. La cucina del ristorante è molto apprezzata. Da ritornarci!!!",5,2015,11,08

Hotelbar ist eher langweilig",3,2015,11,06
248,Ideale Lage um Dublin zu Fuss zu erkunden,"Die  Zimmer sind zwar ziemlich klein , aber gut eingerichtet, das Bett ist gross und die Matratzen von guter Qualität. Leider hatten wir in der ersten Nacht ein Zimmer zum Hintereingang und zum Hof. Die Lüftungsturbinen waren grad unter dem Fenster....Die Lüftung rohrte ununterbrochen und wir konnten nicht schlafen ! Auch Ohrenpax nützten nichts. Wir haben reklamiert und bekamen ohne Probleme ein neues Zimmer , das ruhiger war .Das Personal ist sehr freundlich und hilfsbereit. Der Speisesaal fürs Frühstück ist gross und hat den Charme einer Kantine , Das Frühschtück ist reichhaltig und  lässt  keine Wünsche offen,das Servicepersonal sehr zuvorkommend  :-) Ganz lecker war das Brot und die feinen Fruchtsäfte.Jeden Tag besonderer Saft mit Angabe von Vitaminen usw.

Wifi gratuito.",5,2015,09,13
248,Ottimo,"Camere molto pulite e comode,colazione abbondante con varie specialità caratteristiche. A pochissimi minuti dalle attrazioni senza prendere mezzi.
Si può raggiungere i pub e il Parco Stephen Green.
Lo consiglio",5,2015,09,03
248,Meriterebbe più cure,"L'hotel è un quattro stelle posto in un'ottima posizione visto che si raggiungono a piedi tutte le attrazioni di Dublino (giardni botanici esclusi) e che è vicinissimo al bellissimo parco di St Stephen green e alla centralissima Grafton street decisamente la migliore via per lo shopping di Dublino ma... in camera la tenda era chiaramente sporca, il personale non ha mai sostituito i bicchieri usati lasciando esattamente nella posizione in cui i trovava (persino con l'acqua dentro), il bollitore per l'acqua per il te era arrugginito e nessuno prestava attenzione all'uso che gli ospiti facevano degli spazi comuni, per cui c'era chi piazzava serenamente le scarpe sul tavolino della hall, che schiamazzava in piscina tentando di appropriarsi di teli altrui, chi caricava bibite nella macchinetta di buon mattino etc. Nessuno poi aveva un'idea di dove si acquistassero le tessere per usare i mezzi pubblici...

Insomma l'hotel ha delle potenzialità ma in un quattro stelle la porta del bagno dello spogliatoio femminile divelta, con conseguente necessità di usufruire bagnate di un bagno posto nella zone comune del centro benessere, è sinceramente inaccettabile.",4,2015,07,14
248,Amplias habitaciones,"El Hotel dispone de habitaciones muy amplias y un baño suficientemente grande.

Tiene pantalla plana y grande en las habitaciones aunque no tiene canales en español, pero si disponen de USB para poner pelis que lleves en pinchos.

El desayuno es bueno tipo buffet combinando desayunos continentales e irlandés.

Lo malos es que no está muy céntrico.",4,2015,07,12
248,Sehr empfehlenswert,"Eines der Auswahlkriterien warum wir uns für Camden Court entschieden haben waren die Parkplätze beim Hotel. Etwas schwer zu finden - trotz Navi - aber alles andere war TOP. Vom herzlichen Empfang über die Sauberkeit der Zimmer bis zum Check out, waren wir sehr zufrieden. Das überaus freundliche Personal in der Rezeption möchten wir extra erwähnen!",5,2015,05,15
248,Buon hotel ma...,L'hotel si trova in una posizione defilata rispetto al centro raggiungibile con una passeggiata di circa 15 minuti. Nella zona ci sono ristoranti e pub ed è in prossimità del bellissimo Parco Stephen Green. Le camere sono spaziose ma hanno la moquette che avrebbe bisogno di essere sostituita così come l'arredo mento non proprio da 4 stelle. Buona la colazione con un buon rapporto qualità prezzo. Il personale parla solo inglese.avendolo prenotato ad un buon prezzo è andata bene ma credo ci sia di meglio.,3,2015,05,04
248,Buona scelta ,"Camere comode e pulite. Colazione  ottima e abbondante.
Posizione semi-centrale ma facilmente  raggiungibile (15 minuti a piedi dal centro).
Il personale alla reception però è un po' approssimativo e le indicazioni sui mezzi pubblici sono state scarse.
Anche il pub limitrofo merita una visita.

248,"Limpio, tranquilo, algo alejado.","He pasado la Semana Santa con mi mujer. Tanto la habitación como el baño son grandes y limpios. El personal de recepción es amable y servicial aunque ninguno hablaba español. El hotel está a 15-20 minutos de Temple Bar y 20-25 minutos de O´Connor Street. Para el precio 140euros/noche sin desayuno, esperábamos algo más. Posiblemente nos alojaremos en otro hotel en nuestra próxima visita a Dublín.",3,2015,04,08

Cuenta con un bar muy agradable
Como unica pega diria que esta algo alejado del centro pero como recomendacion a futuros clientes teneis bastantes lineas de autobus en la misma puerta (el 16 va directo al aeropuerto) o un taxi desde el hotel al centro son 5€ asi que no supone un gran gasto por ahorrarse el paseo.

Negli anni posso dire di essermi sempre trovata bene: camere spaziose, confortevoli, personale assolutamente gradevole, ristorante di discreta qualità sia per cibo che per servizio, palestra e piscina compresa nella tariffa. La pulizia anche in camera è generalmente molto buona, il bagno, la doccia e la moquette son sempre pulitissimi. La pecca (anche se devo ammettere che capita non spesso) è la pulizia delle lenzuola. A volte noto che sono un po' usurate o non ben lavate. Ma onestamente gli irlandesi sono poco attenti a queste cose :) per il resto... Eccellente. ",4,2014,09,01

Die Zimmer sind gross und das Bad ebenfalls. Das Frühstücksbuffet ist sehr grosszügig in der Auswahl und man sollte die Reservation gleich im Internet mit dem Zimmer zusammen bestellen, dann erhält man einen besseren Preis. Die Bar/das Pub ""the bleeding horse"" gleich am Hotel dran ist für Nachtschwärmer bestens geeignet. Etwas laut am Abend aber dafür läuft was. Hier kostet das Guiness €4.60 was für Dublin o.k. ist. Die Lage ist etwa ausserhalb des Zentrums aber mit einem Taxi für ca. €8 in alle Richtungen gut erreichbar. Das Fitnesscenter ist im Untergeschoss und hat alles was das fitte Herz begehrt: einen grossen Pool, ein Whirlpool (Jaccuzi), einen Steamroom. Hier können sich auch Kinter gut verweilen.

Dista 10 minuti dalla zona centrale e più ""caotica"" di temple bar, la sera è assolutamente tranquillo e le camere sono sempre pulite e ordinate. Il personale è cordiale e c'è il wifi gratuito. Unica pecca è il costo elevato della colazione ma se andate nei bar vicini (io sono andato al Fontana's cafè e mi sono trovato benissimo), spendete meno e vi risparmiate un po' di euro da investire in qualche pinta di birra a Temple bar!",5,2014,05,19

248,Comodo,"Hotel dal buon rapporto qualità/prezzo, situato non molto distante dal centro e dalle maggiori attrazioni di Dublino. La nostra camera, pulita, spaziosa e silenziosa, era situata al quarto piano con vista su un cortile interno. Il segnale del wi-fi (gratuito) era ottimo. Discreta, anche, l'esperienza all'Iveagh (il ristorante dell'hotel).",5,2014,04,20
248,buon hotel tranne il portiere di notte,"Posizionato a ridosso del centro di dublino e ben servito dai mezzi pubblici (bus n. 16 per l'aeroporto), si trova questo hotel molto grande.
C'è veramente tutto: stanze ottimamente arredate (anche bricco per caffè, thè, asse da stiro) e letti molto grandi.
Ristorante, brasserie, centro benessere (palestra e sauna-bagno turco gratuiti). 
C'è un pub attaccato all'albergo, comunque a pochi passi ci sono ristoranti anche di buon livello.
In circa venti minuti si raggiunge il centro a piedi.
Nota dolente: personale al desk notturno (un tipo alto e magro) sgarbato e approssimativo.
Ci ha rifilato la prima notte una stanza vecchia, con arredi penosi di fronte al distributore delle bibite, all'ascensore e sulla strada! Era troppo tardi per fare casino; quindi il giorno dopo - sempre dallo stesso tipo che ci voleva rifilare la stessa stanza - abbiamo preteso il cambio con facce torve e poche discussioni.
Alla fine abbiamo avuto una stanza normale che è all'altezza delle recensioni lette sulla struttura.
Comunque, in buona sostanza, il personale è scostante e litigioso.
Dimenticatevi la calda e cortese accoglienza italica.",4,2014,03,13
248,Un ottimo albergo,"Ritorno al Camden Court Hotel dopo alcuni anni, memore di un soggiorno molto positivo.
Posso confermare che questo albergo rappresenta una certezza per tutti coloro intenzionati a soggiornare a Dublino.

La posizione, nel South Side a poca distanza da St. Stephen's Green, nel bel mezzo di uno dei quartieri più vivi e frizzanti della città, rende possibile recarsi a piedi presso tutti i monumenti e le mete del turismo in città, ma nello stesso tempo consente di soggiornare in una zona autentica e non tappezzata di paccottiglia turistica o ristoranti-trappola.

L'hotel in recensione offre anche un ristorante (presso il quale abbiamo mangiato piuttosto bene una sera), un piccolo ma confortevole pub, la piscina e un angolo internet (utile per stampare le carte d'imbarco). 

Le stanze sono piuttosto grandi, pulite e confortevoli come ricordavo; lo stesso dicasi per il bagno, che tuttavia aveva il lavandino parzialmente tappato. Da rivedere pure l'eccessiva temperatura nella stanza e, più in generale, dell'intera struttura.

Per gli amanti della colazione irlandese, suggerisco senz'altro quella offerta dall'albergo ad un prezzo equo, a patto che si sfrutti adeguatamente la formula ""a volontà"": bacon, salsicce, uova, ma pure yogurt, cereali, frutta, coissant, marmellata fino a quando non sarete sazi. Se invece vi accontentate di una tazza di caffé e di un croissant, forse è meglio fermarsi ad uno dei tanti caffè lungo la strada che porta nella zona più centrale della capitale irlandese.",4,2014,03,10
248,comodo e confortevole,"Sono stato con amico in ottobre 2013. L'albergo è comodo in 15-20 min a piedi si raggiunge Temple Bar. La camera era confortevole, pulita e silenziosa. Consigliata la ricca colazione, mi pare di ricordare costasse 10 euro in più ma li valeva tutti. 
Nonostante il ritardo dell'aereo, arrivando alle 00.30 alla reception siamo stati accolti con grande gentilezza e disponibilità. 
PS Una curiosità interessante: siamo andati e tornati senza problemi coi mezzi pubblici, al ritorno però abbiamo constatato che, fermi con le valigie sulla strada principale all'altezza della fermata del bus per l'aeroporto, i taxi si fermavano offrendo di portarci ad una tariffa pari a quella del bus ... (ma avevamo già il biglietto).",4,2014,02,07
248,Solide,"Gutes Hotel in der Nähe des Zentrums. Saubere Standardzimmer, prima Service, gutes Frühstück. Endlich ein Hotelpool in dem man wirklich Schwimmen kann. Insgesamt: empfehlenswert für einen kurzen Aufenthalt in Dublin.",4,2014,01,13
248,"Céntrico, limpio, recomendable","Comienzo de la aventura en Dublín. Reservamos en Septiembre 2013 una habitación doble para una noche en este hotel. A favor? Habitaciones cómodas y limpias. Personal amable. Supermercados cerca. En contra? El precio. Es muy caro. No incluía desayuno. Era la única habitación que encontramos disponible para ese fin de semana. En fin, recomendable a pesar del precio.",4,2013,12,01
248,buon hotel,"non troppo distante da Temple Bar, circa un quarto d'ora a piedi. servizio gentile alla reception, hanno soddisfatto le mie richieste, anche se non particolarmente difficili (taxi per l'aeroporto il giorno della ripartenza). LA camera era pulita e sufficientemente spaziosa, molto silenziosa. purtroppo nessun canale italiano in TV. La colazione e' discreta, non male, ma ho visto di meglio.",3,2013,12,01
248,Citynah und faire Preise,"Die Lage des Hotels ist super für eine Städtetour. Die Innenstadt ist gut zu Fuß zu erreichen und in der Umgebung gibt es genügend Möglichkeiten, auch per Bus oder Bahn die Umgebung zu erkunden. Das Frühstück ist für den Preis absolut angemessen, 13 € für ein gutes irisches Frühstück. Ansonsten ist das Personal sehr freundlich und bemüht, die Zimmer sind sauber und der Gesamteindruck ist wirklich gut.",5,2013,10,07
248,Perfetto,"Arrivati  da Palermo abbiamo dormito per una notte in questo hotel.
Accoglienza cordiale e gentile alla reception, nonostante l'ora tarda (le 01,00) con dovizia di informazioni sui servizi dell'hotel.
Camera grande, confortevole, pulita e silenziosa con Tv a schermo piatto, cassaforte, bollitore per tè e caffè.
Bagno con vasca perfettamente pulito e funzionale.
Letto grande e comodissimo.
Al mattino abbiamo scoperto con piacere che la struttura è allocata al centro della città vicino al Trinity College e al Temple Bar che abbiamo comodamente raggiunto a piedi.
Assolutamente perfetto per le nostre esigenze, mi sento di consigliarlo.",4,2013,09,01
248,Posizione ottimale,"Buon hotel situato 300 metri a sud del St.Stephen Garden, a 20 minuti a piedi da Temple Bar. Dotato di parcheggio gratuito, camere con ogni comfort e una ricca colazione. Probabilmente si trovano soluzioni più economiche ma comunque cercando tra le varie offerte proposte io ho trovato una notte a 119 euro anziche i 185 normalmente richiesti",4,2013,08,20
248,"ALBERGO MODERNO,GRANDE E VICINO AL CENTRO","Albergo enorme, nascosto dietro un arco e piccolo cortile,tutto in mattoncini all'esterno.
Abbostanza silenzioso, situato nella parte di Dublino al di sotto del fiume Liffey,permette di raggiungere Trinity College, Temple Bar e zone limitrofe in 10-15 minuti a piedi.Non credo dotato di parcheggio proprio. Camere abbastanza ampie,ben arredate,pulito.Dotato di Spa.Wifi gratuito interno
Ottimo ed abbondante il breakfast irlandese.
Da consigliare",4,2013,08,19
248,Everything is nice,"Wir wohnten im Camden Court Hotel am Anfang einer Reise, für 2 Nächte und am Ende der Reise, für eine Nacht. Die Rezeption war freundlich und gut auf uns, als größere Gruppe, vorbereitet. 
Die Zimmer sind zweckmäßig und sauber. Die Lage ist vorteilhaft um einen ruhigen Schlaf nach einem Pub crawl zu gewährleisten. Es gibt freies WLAN und einen netten Wellnessbereich. Pool, Whirlpool und Sauna sind sauber. Es empfiehlt sich, eine Badekappe für den Pool mitzubringen (bei längeren Haaren), da sonst eine Leihgebühr von 2,50€ anfällt.
Das Frühstücksbuffet ist reichlich. Wünsche werden gerne erfüllt. Kaffee oder Tee wird am Tisch serviert.
Sollte man auf eine Pub-Runde am Abend verzichten wollen, befindet sich direkt nebenan, gutes Essen und übliche Getränke.
Insgesamt waren wir sehr zufrieden mit der gut organisierten Aufstellung des Camden Court. Das Temple Bar Viertel erreicht man in 10 Minuten Fußweg, den Flughafen in ca. 20 Min. Taxifahrt.",5,2013,07,25
248,Ottimo hotel nei pressi del centro,"Hotel situato in una zona piuttosto tranquilla ma vicina al centro, St Stephen's Green e Grafton Street si raggiungono in poco più di 5 minuti a piedi, Temple Bar in 15.
Le camere sono grandi, il letto comodissimo, e tutto è pulitissimo. Wifi gratuito disponibile anche nelle camere, colazione abbondante e buona. C'è anche un centro benessere e una piscina, ma non sono riuscito ad usufruirne per mancanza di tempo!
Per essere un 3 stelle è veramente un ottimo hotel.",5,2013,05,31
248,Hotel perfetto per soggiorni a Dublino,"Sono stata con mio marito in questo Hotel 4 notti i primi di maggio ed entrambi siamo rimasti molto soddisfatti. Innanzitutto, ha un ottimo rapporto qualità prezzo. Abbiamo prenotato volo + hotel tramite il sito aerlingus e abbiamo ottenuto un ottimo prezzo, migliore rispetto ad altri siti di viaggi. L'albergo è un 3 stelle, ma ne vale anche 4, la ns. camera era al 6 piano, dava sul cortile interno per cui era silenziosissima, oltre ad essere molto pulita. Abbastanza spaziosa, dotata di tv a schermo piatto, cassaforte, asse da stiro, bollitore con te e caffè. Bagno con vasca. L'hotel è abbastanza centrale ma fuori dal caos di temple bar, che comunque si raggiunge a piedi in un quarto d'ora. Volendo nelle vicinanze ci sono diversi posti per cenare oltre a dei supermarket. Non avevamo la colazione inclusa nel prezzo ma ciò nonostante tutte le mattine abbiamo fatto colazione qui al prezzo di € 13 ciascuno perchè era molto buona. C'è la possibilità di fare la full irish breakfast (consigliata) oppure classica colaizone continentale con croissant, toast, marmellata, yogurth, cereali, frutta, prosciutto e formaggio. Wi.fi gratuito a disposizione. Vi è anche piscina e centro benessere ma non abbiamo avuto il tempo di utilizzarlo. Presente anche un ristorante e un bar, che però non abbiamo provato. Insomma, c'è tutto quello di cui potreste avere bisogno!!!! ci torneremmo sicuramente",5,2013,05,29
248,Tutto ok,"Veramente tutto ok. Posizione ottima: a 10 minuti a piedi da Grafton Street. di giorno si può attraversare anche il parco adiacent. Allo stesso tempo in una zona tranquilla e fuori dal ""casino"" di temple bar. Ben servito dai mezzi pubblici: diversi autobus arrivano in centro.
Noi avevamo una camera al sesto piano, molto silenziosa. L'albergo è pulito per gli standard locali. Come dappertutto c'è la moquette, che trovo terribile, ma che è il pavimento standard per quasi tutti gli alberghi. Alla reception sono gentili e prodighi di informazioni. In camera c'è anche un bollitore e diverse bustine di tè o caffè solubile.
Il ristorante non lo abbiamo provato ma all'apparenza sembrava buono. Non abbiamo provato neppure la SPA. In sostanza io lo consiglierei senza alcun dubbio",4,2013,04,30
248,tranquillità,"se cercate tranquillità, pulizia, gentilezza camden court è quello che fa per voi. la colazione è ottima e le stanze spaziose
vicino ai maggiori luoghi di interesse, ben collegato dall'aeroporto (linea 16).

248,Excelente Hotel para alojarse en Dublin.,"Desde el 28 al 30 de Marzo de 2013 nos alojamos en este Hotel con mi esposa. Realmente nos encontramos con una habitación con baño privado, confortable, con instalaciones que hacen a una estadía placentera de quien se aloje en este Hotel, con un parking apropiado y de fácil acceso al Hotel, y con una ubicación en la ciudad de Dublín, que nos facilitó el arribo en coche desde la terminal de ferrys y que la día siguiente nos posibilitó y cenacho acceso a las principales atracciones de la ciudad. El desayuno fué muy rico y bien servido. El personal, servicial y amable facilitó el bienestar de nuestra estadía.",5,2013,04,23
248,OTTIMO ALBERGO..PROBLEMI CAMERA,"Ottimo albergo situato leggermente al di fuori del centro vero e proprio, comunque a 15 minuti a piedi da TempleBar, struttura accogliente e pulita, personale cordialissimo, camera ampia e carina con l'unico problema del termosifone regolabile....purtroppo anche quando si chiudeva, il rumore dell'acqua nelle tubature si continuava a sentire....per una persona dal sonno leggero come me è stato un bel problema. Informandomi da altri ospiti il problema pareva fosse solo il mio pertanto ritengo la struttura validissima anche in rapporto qualità/prezzo...come consiglio evitate la camera 404.",3,2013,04,23
248,Molto buono,"Ottima posizione, a pochi minuti a piedi dal centro, stanze grandi e pulite. Il personale è gentile e disponibile, la hall e la sala da pranzo bellissime e molto curate. L'unica pecca è la rumorosità: purtroppo mi è capitata una stanza al primo piano che si affacciava sulla strada dietro l'hotel e di notte c'era parecchio frastuono. Se non fosse stato per questo inconveniente sarebbe stato un soggiorno perfetto!",4,2013,04,17
248,En pleno centro pero zona tranquila,"Esta en pleno centro pero en una zona tranquila. Las habitaciones amplias y comodas. En general la atencion es buena. El desayuno no es excelente pero esta bien. En los alrededores y en menos de un minuto andando hay pubs, tiendas, restaurantes... Recomendable.",5,2013,03,01
248,Recomiendo este hotel,"Compartí una habitación con mis tres hijas y tuvimos mucho espacio, buena atención y estupendo precio. Está en una tranquila zona bastante cerca del centro. Las personas que nos atendieron en recepción en los diferentes días fueron muy amables.",4,2013,01,30
248,als Ausgangsort für eine Stadtreise geeignet,"Die Innenstadt von Dublin ist zu Fuß in 10 min zu erreichen. Die Zimmer sind zweckmäßig und einfach eingerichtet, laden aber nicht zum Verweilen ein. Wer es ruhiger mag, fragt ein Zimmer in der oberen Etage zum Hof an. Die Halle und das Restaurant sind nett gestaltet, die Bar ist nicht so gemütlich ( da bieten sich eher die zahlreichen Pubs in der Stadt an ). Das Frühstück ist gut, der Service freundlich und hilfsbereit.",3,2013,01,05
248,Un' ottima soluzione senza spendere una fortuna,"Il bus dell'aeroporto ferma a 5 minuti a piedi dall'albergo. Il personale della reception e' cortese e solerte. La hall e le aree comuni sono belle e ben tenute. Le stanze sono pulite ed ordinate ed il mobilio e' di buona qualità. La nostra stanza dava sul retro ed è sempre stata molto silenziosa garantendoci delle belle dormite. La colazione non era compresa nella tariffa, ma c'è un piccolo supermercato ad un isolato per cui la cosa non ha mai rappresentato un problema.  Il centro e' raggiungibile con una breve e piacevole passeggiata.",5,2013,01,02
248,Ottimo per il primo giorno a Dublino,"Hotel raffinato situato in ottima posizione vicino al centro, facilmente raggiungibile dall'aeroporto anche in macchina, accogliente e pulito.
Presenza di parcheggio interno gratuito.
Stanze spaziose e poco rumorose con wi-fi gratis.
Presenza di vari Pub nella zona",4,2012,11,04
248,Buen hotel!,"Estuvimos cómodos, no esta ubicado en pleno centro pero a 10 cuadras, se llega rápido caminando o en bus. Las habitaciones y la cama cómoda. Solo estuvimos una noche y no utilizamos el resto de las instalaciones y estuvimos muy bien y la atención muy buena!",3,2012,08,25
248,Excelente relación Calidad-Precio,"Estuve con una amiga la pasada Semana Santa y en general mi opinión sobre el hotel es excelente. El único inconeviente es que no está ubicado en centro neurálgico de la ciudad (a pie el Trininy Collage quedará a unos 15-20 minutos y el Temple Bar a unos 30 minutos), aunque si te gusta alojarte en una zona tranquila es ideal, además está muy cercano a los dos grandes parques de la ciudad.

El trato del personal y la habituación (muy limpia) son correctos además dispone de piscina, jacuzzi, sauna y gimnasio gratuitos para sus clientes, servicios que no son habituales en hoteles de 3 estrellas.",4,2012,07,20
248,Una settimana da favola!,"Situato in ottima posizione vicino al centro, facilmente raggungibile dall'aeroporto, nelle immediate vicinanze dell'Hotel ci sono locali dove mangiare, vari take away, un market e almeno due pub, uno addirittura adiacente. 
Il personale è cordiale, le camere spaziose, pulite e ben isolate acusticamente dotate di phon, bollitore e accesso internet e wireless gratuiti. 
La piscina è aperta fino alle 10 di sera ed è stata molto gradita insieme all'idromassaggio. 
Colazione ottima con full irish breakfast cucinato al momento.
Ottimo rapporto qualità prezzo. Vivamente consigliato!",5,2012,05,18
248,Angenehmes Hotel,"Das Hotel gehört nicht zu einer internationalen Kette und ist insofern landestypisch und damit etwas plüschig. Ich empfand es jedoch als sehr angenehm und sauber. Die Bar ist OK und das Personal freundlich. Seit die Luas gebaut ist, kommt man mit zwei Stationen zum Stefans Green. Die Haltestelle ist um die Ecke. Alternativ 20 Min Fußweg. Fazit:Nicht die Topspitze aber absolut zu empfehlen.",4,2012,05,05
248,"bella struttura, un 4 stelle di tutto rispetto","l'hotel si trova su camden street, e con una camminata di 10 minuti scarsi si arriva in grafton street (via dello shopping principale). per arrivare nella zona trinity college servono altri 5 minuti di camminata. si gira benissimo tutta la città a piedi partendo da questo hotel.  
la zona è tranquilla, no rumori notturni, e offre alcuni pub e ristoranti nelle immdiate vicinanze.   l'hotel è moderno, le camere spaziose, con un arredamento semplice ma curato.  
pulizia ottima. ottima la colazione a pagamento nel ristornate dell'hotel. 
un 4 stelle di tutto rispetto. 
da conseigliare per chi gradisce strutture ben curate appena fuori dalla confusione di pub e negozi.",4,2012,05,02
248,Un poco dejado,"Lo mejor con diferencia de este hotel es su personal. Como es habitual en Irlanda, el personal fue muy simpático y servicial a pesar de que el hotel estaba completo (durante St. Patick's). 
Está a unos 15 minutos andando del centro, y tiene un pub muy popular justo en la esquina, pero aún así no es ruidoso. 
El edificio por fuera está bien, y la recepción muy bien. Da muy buena impresión al entrar, pero nada más salir del ascensor y llegar al piso, los pasillos están muy viejos. La habitación mejora, está bien. El baño es correcto. 
Un fallo de la habitación es que no tenía cortinas de día. Solo unas que dejaban la habitación a oscuras. O a oscuras, o sin cortinas. 
El desayuno es un poco malo. Un poco en plan batalla, pero sirve para coger fuerzas y empezar el día.
No es mala opción, pero carece por completo de encanto alguno.",3,2012,04,02
248,Weekend a Dublino,"Sono stato in questo Hotel di Dublino in occasione dell'incontro del 6 Nazioni 2012 tra Italia e Irlanda.
Scelto per la posizione comoda (10 minuti a piedi per arrivare a Temple Bar e 20 minuti per raggiungere l'AVIVA Stadium), siamo rimasti felicemente sorpresi nel trovarci in un bell'Hotel pulito, comodo e con stanze grandi.
Bella la hall, molto grande e con annesso ristorante (non lo abbiamo ""testato"") e sala breakfast.
Personale gentile e disponibile, dopo le 23 la porta principale viene chiusa ma si può entrare tranquillamente da una laterale, alla quale si è accolti da un uomo della sicurezza che verifica nome e stanza prima di lasciar entrare.
Stanze ampie e letti ""king size"" molto comodi, ci hanno fatto riposare e recuperare energia dopo le serate nei pub.
Nonostante l'hotel  sia ubicato su un incrocio molto trafficato, una volta dentro la stanza non si sentiva volare una mosca!
Bagno pulito e ampio.
Spettacolare poi il fatto che ci sia un caratteristico pub proprio in fianco all'hotel in cui poter passare la serata senza quasi muoversi dalla camera, utile anche per cenare se si esce un po' tardi (i pub chiudono molto presto la cucina...) prima di raggiungere il centro di Dublino per passare la serata.",5,2012,03,05
248,Hotel eccellente,"Ho soggiornato per una notte presso l'hotel Camden Court. Mi sono trovato molto bene per la pulizia e il comfort della stanza. Ho riposato molto bene grazie alla quiete che regna in tutto l'hotel, nonostante la posizione centrale. Notevole la cortesia del personale alla reception. Ottimo il ristorante.",5,2012,01,07
248,Le faltan algunos detalles,"La situación es buena, a 20 minutos andando del Trinity College, y todo es camino tiene tiendas, bares, cafeterías.... se puede coger el bus 16A que deja casi en la puerta.
La habitación es algo antigua, la calefacción es de radiador de pared que funciona con agua caliente y hace bastante ruido cuando está en marcha. 
El cuarto de baño está bien aunque sólo ponen jabón, gel y gorro de ducha, se hecha en falta algunas cosas más. Las toallas del baños son pequeñas.
El desayuno iba incluido en el precio pero tenía poca variedad, le faltaba algo más de bollería y dulce.
Lo que no me gustó fue que no tiene caja fuerte en la habitación, para mí es fundamental, y la única cadena de televisión española es la autonómica gallega. Y lo peor, no hay wi-fi!!!!! Usé el ordenador junto a recepción para hacer sacar la tarjeta de embarque del avión y funciona con monedas, 1 euro-10 minutos, e imprimir 12 paginas me costó 6 euros!!!!
La piscina no la utilicé pero no tenía mala pinta.
Cuando entras en el hotel te esperas algo más de lo que te encuentras en realidad.",3,2011,12,05
248,Buen hotel con muy buena relación calidad-precio,"El hotel Camden Court en Dublín está muy bien. La habitación era muy nueva y confortable, y la recepción/restaurante son muy agradables. Además, los hoteles en Dubín son caros y en este pagamos 82€ por la habitación doble con desayuno buffet incluído (que ya cuesta 13€ por persona si se paga allí...). Por lo que la relación calidad-precio está muy muy bien.
La piscina/spa que anuncian no son gran cosa, pero probamos el jacuzzi, la piscina y la sauna y están más que bien.
Respecto a la ubicación, está a unos 15 minutos a pie del centro, distancia más que asumible a nuestro parecer. El paseo desde el hotel a la zona de tiendas (Grafton) por el parque St Stephen's Green está muy bien, mejor que la via más directa (por Camden Street).",5,2011,10,05
248,Schönes Hotel in gute Lage,"Das Hotel war im Rahmen einer Rundreise über Marcopolo gebucht. Das Zimmer war geräumig und ordentlich, ebenso das Bad. Leider hörte man zum Teil den recht geschäftigen Straßenlärm. Sehr gutes Frühstücksbuffet. Gute Lage, um Dublin zu Fuß zu erkunden! Schöner Wellnessbereich, der aber etwas sauberer hättes ein dürfen!",4,2011,08,26
248,Really Nice!,"abbiamo soggiornato in questo hotel 2 volte sia con amici che in famiglia. è veramente un affare. si trova in una posizione strategica: massimo 10 minuti a piedi dal centro di Dublino! le camere sono pulite e silenziose. Gli addetti al ricevimento veramente cordiali. Camere spaziose, letti grandi e molto comodi! Se dovete andare a Dublino è un posto da tenere in considerazione!",5,2011,07,28
248,hotel confortable con piscina  y spa incluido,"Estuvimos en Dublín para las fiestas de St.Patricks, y nos decidimos por este hotel porq habia visto q era un 4 * y ademas en el precio incluía el spa ( piscina , spa, sauna y baño turco). La vista de fuera parece como si fuera viejo , pero de dentro es muy bonito y esta muy cuidado. El desayuno es tipo buffet con abundantes cosas ( probar los yogures! q están buenisimos!) Apegado al hotel , hay un pub-bar q se llama the bleeding horse , q esta muy bien para comer o tomarte una cerveza. Si vais a Dublin es interesante sacar la Dublin pass , porque tienes acceso a bastantes cosas de la ciudad.",4,2011,07,19
248,Keine irische Gastfreundschaft,"Das Hoetlm wurde überraschend von TRipadvisor als ""Award-winning"" ausgezeichnet.  Die Situation stellt sich jedoch anders dar: unfreundliuches Personalo, beginnend an der Rezeption, Minimumpunsum), finster drein blickendes Personal im Restaurant und in der Lobby,  kein Gune Morgen von Zimmermädchne, auch finstere Blicke. Man fühlte sich sofrot und auf Dauer unwohl in dem Hotel.  Der Serives beim Frühstück war schleppend, auch wenn viel Andrang war. Für einen Tomatzensaft als Extra sprach das Personal sofort von extra Charges.
Immerhin: Poolbereich gross, gepflegt. Zimmer auf solidem Standard.
Fazit: zum Wohlfühlen nicht geeignet!",1,2011,06,13
248,"En general, bien.","Nos hemos alojado dos noches en este hotel. La noche del sábado bastante más cara que la de domingo. En general ha estado bien, el personal de recepción excelente, hablando un ingles perfectamente entendible. Por las noches sólo queda abierta una de las dos puertas de entrada, y en esa puerta hay un guarda de seguridad velando por los clientes.

Esta en Lower Camden, a sólo unos pasos del centro, para poder visitar sin problemas ni transporte público el parke Stephen's Green, Grafton Street, Molly Malone y Trinity College.. Las zonas de comerciales de O'connell street i Temple Bar quedan algo más alejadas, pero no más de 15 minutos andando.

Recomiendo este hotel, sólo para un par de noches.",3,2011,05,10
248,Bestes Preis-Leistungsverhältnis!,"Funktionales Doppelzimmer mit allem was das Herz begehrt, WLAN, Pool mit Whirlpool und Sauna, gemütliche Lobby und sehr zuvorkommendes Personal. 

Einziger Minuspunkt: Im Pool muß eine Badekappe getragen werden. Aus hygienischen Gründen. Aber die Sauna wird schön als Aufwärmraum für ältere Damen im Badeanzug genutzt. Von wegen Hygiene. Ich lach mich kaputt.

Aber sonst alles toll. Dazu kommt die super Lage. 10 Minuten zu Fuß in die Stadt. Gegenüber ist aber der öffentliche Fahrradverleih (Charlotte Road) wo man für 2 Euro 3 Tage lang überall in der Stadt Fahrräder nutzen kann.

Rechts daneben ein Super Pub (Bleeding Horse) und über die Strasse gibts Fish & Chips und den besten Döner der Stadt.

Und nochwas - mit dem Bus 16A kommt man für 2,30 EUR direkt zum Flughafen.",5,2011,04,20
248,Bellissimo soggiorno,"Prima di descrivere l’albergo desidero parlarvi del receptionist Krystian, una persona veramente speciale , che ci ha accolto con un grande sorriso al nostro arrivo e ci ha fatto sentire veramente a casa. Krystian è la persona che tutti i turisti vorrebbero incontrare all’arrivo in albergo. E’ gentile, entusiasta, sorridente, efficiente e professionalissimo. Grazie ancora a te Krystian per tutto quello che hai fatto per noi.

Sono appena tornata da un soggiorno di 6 notti presso questo bellissimo albergo. Situato in posizione strategica e raggiungibile con l'autobus n.16/A che parte dall'Aeroporto e ferma a circa 20 metri dall'albergo. Il biglietto costa solo € 2,20 per gli adulti e € 1 per i bambini e si può fare a bordo. Non conviene gettare soldi per i taxi. Il viaggio in autobus dura circa 1 ora e consente di vedere già la città. A pochissimi metri dall'albergo di sono 2 supermercati aperti a volte fino alle 23 e ristoranti di varie etnie. 
Il personale dell'albergo é efficientissimo, gentilissimo e disponibile per ogni richiesta. Gli spazi sono vasti, a partire a dall'enorme hall, ai vari bar, alle sale conferenze e alla piscina ed al centro benessere, veramente ideale per riposarsi dopo una gionata di cammino. Il prezzo é eccezionalmente vantaggioso per ciò che viene offerto e soprattutto per una famiglia come la mia, composta da due adulti , un'adolescente ed un bambino. La stanza quadrupla é molto grande e spaziosa. A disposizione c'é anche , gratuitamente, il bollitore con il té, il caffe, il latte e lo zucchero. Una grande comodità per chi vuole bere una bevanda calda...gratis!!
Ho dato un'occhiata a m olti alberghi del centro però le hall non mi ispiravano molto. Il Camden ti accoglie veramente con gli spazi confortevoli. Lo consiglio a tutti, sia a uomini d'affari che alle famiglie.",5,2010,04,19

248,buena relacion calidad-precio,"El hotel es bastante normal, pero para los precios que se manejan por allí, sale económico. Está un poco retirado de Temple Bar, y si no llueve no pasa nada, pero en nuestra estancia estaban las calles heladas, y hacía frío para verlo. En cualquier caso, lo recomendaría.",3,2010,02,16
248,Tutto perfetto,"Ho soggiornato per tre notti al Camden Court Hotel di Dublino in occasione di un fine settimana nella capitale irlandese, e posso dire di essere estremamente soddisfatto per la sistemazione. 
L'albergo si trova nel South Side, a circa una decina di minuti a piedi dalla zona di  Grafton Street e a cinque dai bei giardini di St. Stephen's Green. L'area di Camden Street è sicura e frequentata a tutte le ore, anche perché è recentemente diventata uno dei fulcri della vita notturna della capitale irlandese.
L'albergo, di aspetto e concezione moderna, ha una clientela mista di viaggiatori per ragioni di lavoro e di divertimento: esso si presta ad entrambe le soluzioni, in quanto fa dello spazio a disposizione degli ospiti il suo asset più importante, e ciò vale sia per gli spazi comuni (reception, bar e sala per colazione), sia per le stanze. 
La camera a noi assegnata era davvero grande, oltre che pulita e confortevole, e lo stesso dicasi per il bagno. La finestra della camera dava sul cortile interno, per cui abbiamo potuto godere della massima tranquillità.
Il personale al desk è professionale e gentile, anche se magari un poco freddo.
La prima colazione ha un prezzo certo non modico, ma è davvero difficile poter avere una simile scelta al mattino: v'è infatti un bancone dietro il quale un cuoco può mettere nel piatto tutti gli ingedienti che ci aggradano per fare il miglior e più abbondante full Irish breakfast, oltre che un buffet per croissant, toast e marmellata, cereali, salumi, formaggio, yogurt. Inoltre, caffé o te' a volontà per via di un cameriere che gira costantemente fra i tavoli. 
Insomma, la prima colazione del Camden Court Hotel renderà superfluo ogni altro pasto fino a sera... e ciò, considerato il prezzo richiesto, non è affatto male!
Per il viaggiatore italiano che, invece, non ama che una tazza di caffé al mattino, ciò è disponibile gratuitamente grazie ad un bollitore e il caffé solubile (o il te') presso la stanza (come d'abitudine, del resto, in tutti gli hotel, le guest house o i B&B delle Isole britannche).
In conclusione, mi sento di consigliare a tutte le tipologie di viaggiatori il Camden Court Hotel, quale ottima base sia per visitare i siti turistici più importanti di Dublino sia per raggiungere la zona del centro cittadino ove si trovano la maggior parte degli uffici.",5,2010,02,09
248,Buena relación calidad-precio.,"Me hospedé en este hotel durante tres noches y debo decir que en general estuvo muy bien. No está alejado del centro (12-15 minutos caminando a Temple Bar) pero sí en una zona tranquila y muy segura. Un pequeño paseo os separará de los monumentos más importantes de Dublín. De todas formas justo debajo del hotel está uno de los bares más antiguos de la ciudad. Desde la habitación no se escuchaba nada de música, pero resultaba muy agradable para tomar una pinta después de cenar (no muy cara, unos 4,5 euros si mal no recuerdo).
La habitación era amplia, con una buena cama, baño privado con bañera, armarios más que suficientes, televisión de pantalla plana, ventana a una especie de patio o aparcamiento... Ninguna queja con respecto a la limpieza. El único problema es que desde la habitación se oía constantemente el ruido de una especie de extractor que resultaba muy molesto. Nos quejamos pero no nos hicieron mucho caso (de hecho el empleado que nos atendió se limitó a decirnos en un tono algo despectivo que él no escuchaba nada y que no iban a cambiarnos de habitación). Afortunadamente en cualquier farmacia de Dublín puedes adquirir tapones para los oídos.
Otro detalle que no me hizo mucha gracia es que tampoco nos prestaron adaptadores para los enchufes cuando se los pedimos (no sé si es habitual en este tipo de establecimientos que no los tengan). Algunos miembros del personal son algo ariscos, pero no todos. El último día nos atendió una muchacha bastante educada.
El último punto negativo es que la habitación estaba un poco descuidada, con algún que otro desconchón en las paredes, pero nada grave. Tampoco tiene nevera ni minibar.
Lo mejor de este hotel es sin duda la cantidad de servicios gratuitos a los que da acceso. El WI-FI gratuito en las habitaciones funciona muy bien. El spa es muy recomendable, con una piscina cubierta, jacuzzi, sauna y baño turco. No suele haber mucha gente a última hora de la tarde y pude disfrutarse después de un largo día de pateo. Creo que también cuenta con aparcamiento gratuito, pero nosotros no lo usamos.
Por el precio que pagamos (unos 70 euros por noche)y teniendo en cuenta su ubicación y los extras que ofrece (spa, WI-FI, etc) diría que sí es un hotel recomendable, pero debería mejorar algunos aspectos que ensombrecen el conjunto, sobre todo la atención del personal, aunque el día que nos marchamos observamos que a un grupo de alemanes que la estaban liando parda en recepción les trataban con mucha más educación que a nosotros (no eran tan morenitos como nosotros, claro está).",4,2009,12,16
248,Camden Court Hotel... niente male !,"L'Hotel è situato in una zona non centralissima ma comoda per poter, volendo,raggiungere il centro anche a piedi e ben servita dal servizio dei bus 16A-83-122 che passano alternandosi piuttosto frequentemente. Il servizio ai piani  è molto buono, c'è la possibilità di  parcheggiare  gratuitamente l'auto in un cortile interno senza ulteriori spese, la camera doppia ha due letti a una piazza e mezza , manca il frigo  ma è pulita, la nostra nonostane il divieto di fumare esposto sulla porta aveva all'interno leggero odore di fumo ma lasciando aperta la finestra è andato via. Il personale è gentile e tutto sommato siamo stati bene...all'Insomnia Cafè si fa un'ottima colazione per 5euro circa,è proprio davanti all'hotel ,da non considerare invece la Boulangerie anche questa davanti all'hotel ,una colazione arriva a costare 13 euro circa ,identica alla precedente!! Non si sa come mai! Vicino c'è il parrucchiere e numerosi supermercati aperti fino a tardi e locali vari.",3,2009,08,24
248,Semplice ma offre ottime tariffe ed è in una buona posizione,"Ho soggiornato al Camden Court dal 22 al 29 marzo 2009, ho trovato un' offerta favolosa con last minute. Ha una posizione eccezionale, le zone di temple bar oppure di Grafton street sono raggiungibili in pochi minuti a piedi, è servito molto bene dagli autobus e, volendo dall'aeroporto prendendo il 16A si arriva a due passi dall'albergo.Il personale del ricevimento è molto giovane, gentile ma un po' impacciato. Camera al 5° piano, decorosa direi, corredata di: phon, stirapantaloni, asse e ferro da stiro, bollitore per tè e caffè. Volendo trovare un diffetto alla stanza, il letto è piuttosto piccolo rispetto ai letti matrimoniali che si trovano in Italia. E' possibile utilizzare gratuitamente anche la piscina, che dopo una giornata trascorsa a macinare chilometri a piedi non è male! Una serata abbiamo cenato presso il ""C Central bar"", buona cucina in un ambiente informale, prezzi onesti. 
Possibilità di utilizzare internet sia dalle camere che nella hall: veramente esagerato il prezzo Euro 1,00 per 15 minuti!!!
Riassumendo consiglierei sicuramente questa struttura, soprattutto a chi non ha grosse pretese ma desidera comunque una buona struttura in grado di offrire un'ampia gamma di servizi.",4,2009,04,03
248,Zentral und genau richtig für Dublins Regenwetter,"Das Camden Court Hotel liegt zentral 6-8 Gehminuten von St.Stephens Green und damit der Einkaufsstraße entfernt. Direkt in der am Hotel angrenzenden Camden Street gibt es, wenn man nicht in das Restaurant gehen mag, zwei kleinerer Supermärkte und eine Handvoll Pubs/Bars. Ebenso fährt die Buslinie 16A vom Flughafen fast direkt vor die Haustür.

Das Hotel an sich hat trotz seiner ""nur"" 3 Sterne eine sehr schöne und edle Lobby mit stilechten irisch-britannischen Möbeln und auf Wünsch auch Service. Das Personal hilft einem schnell und unkompliziert und alles technische macht einen gepflegten bis sehr guten Eindruck.

Unser Zimmer war für 2 Personen mit einem etwas kleinen, vermutlich 1,40m, Doppelbett und einem Einzelbett ausgestattet. Es gab neben TV und Fön auch einen Wasserkocher mit Tee und Instant-Kaffee für zwischendurch - insgesamt auch sehr praktisch für diverse Fertiggerichte aufzugießen, den Dublin ist schon recht teuer. Die Betten sind eher weich aber akzeptabel. Den besten Eindruck hinterläßt das Bad. Was die Sauberkeit angeht gibt es kaum Mängel, ein paar Ecken werden übersehen die fallem einem nur zufällig auf.

Das Schmankerl jedoch ist das Schwimmbad. Nicht nur ein, leider etwas flaches, Becken hat es, dazu gibt es noch einen Jacuzzi bzw. Whirlpool, eine Dampf und eine Holzsauna. Diese sind genauso wie der gut ausgestattete FitnessClub (wirklich ein kleinerer Club) für Hotelgäste inklusive. Einzig Sportsachen fürs Gym und eine Badekappe (gibs auch für 2,50€  zu kaufen) für den Pool brauch man

Insgesamt ein gutes, zentrales Hotel, dass wenn man es so günstig bekommt wie wir(unter 50€/Nacht) zumSchnäppchen avanciert",4,2009,03,10
248,"Nettes Hotel, aber frühstücken sie im Zimmer","Lage:
Das Hotel liegt etwas außerhalb der Innenstadt. Wir sind immer zu Fuss zur Stadt gegangen, was etwa 20- 25 Minuten gedauert hat. Es fahren aber auch Busse. Der Flughafenbus hält direkt vor dem Hotel.

Zimmer:
Das Zimmer ist geräumig und bietet TV, Wasserkocher, großes Bad. Alles sehr sauber, wenn auch nicht neu. In Anbetracht der großen Menge heruntergekommener Hotels in Dublin eine sehr gute Wahl, zu der wir uns beglückwünschten.

Frühstück:
Die Organisation des Frühstücks ist der Haken bei diesem Hotel. Schon vor etwa 10 Jahren habe ich in diesem Hotel genächtigt und die Situation beim Frühstücksbuffet war schrecklich. Zu viele Leute wollten auf einmal die Speisen, es entstand Stau und man muss warten. Wie ich den vielen anderen Trip- Adviser- Berichten entnehme, hat sich daran nicht viel geändert.
Darum haben wir direkt im Zimmer gefrühstückt. Das lief auch sehr gut ab. Das Frühstück kam zur vereinbarten Zeit, inkl. Toast, einer Sorte Cornflakes und warmen Speisen. Einen Zettel mit den Wünschen kann man bis um 5 Uhr nachts an die Zimmertür hängen. Ich rate jedem, der in Ruhe speisen möchte morgens, dort im Zimmer zu frühstücken. Wir haben es nicht bereut. 
Kritisch anzumerken ist, dass dieses Hotel keine Heiße Schokolade zum Frühstück anbietet.

Service:
Der Service freundlich, aber sehr beschäftigt. Offensichtlich kommen hier oft Reisebusse her.

Fazit:
Wer gut zu Fuss ist bzw. mit dem Auto, sollte dieses Hotel nehmen. Die Zimmer sind schön mit dunklen Möbeln. Wir würden es wohl wieder nehmen.",4,2008,09,01
248,Unpersönliche Massenabfertigung,"Wir waren für 3 Übernachtungen im Camden Court: Mutter, Vater u. ein 11 Jahre alter Sohn. Die bis dato insgesamt guten Kritiken hatten uns überzeugt. Wir mussten dies für uns revidieren: Das Hotel ist zwar nicht grundsätzlich schlecht - wir können es aber nicht weiterempfehlen. Es ist vor allem sehr laut, insbesondere auf der Straßenseite. Da keine Klimaanlage vorhanden ist, kommt man um ein Öffnen des Fensters nicht herum. Die gesamte Nacht herrscht Lärm auf der Straße. Wir behalfen uns mit Ohrstöpseln.
Wir hatten an einem Morgen das Pech, das Frühstück zusammen mit den Passagieren mehrerer Busse einzunehmen. Es herrschte Gedränge, das Büfett war teilweise abgeräumt (so gab es beispielsweise - in insgesamt 3 Behältern - keinen Orangensaft mehr).
Offenbar ist das Hotel auf Busreisende und Massenabfertigung spezialisiert. Das Frühstück ist vollständig auf Selbstbedienung ausgelegt. An heißen Getränken gibt es standardmäßig nur Kaffee und schwarzen Tee. Kakao (hot chocolate) muss extra bestellt werden und kostet €2,95 pro Becher. Auf meine Frage, warum man für Kinder kein kostenloses Heißgetränk bereithalte, bekam ich von einer leitenden Angestellten die Antwort, Kinder könnten schließlich auch Tee oder Kaffee trinken, oder auch Saft (Anm: wenn denn welcher da ist).
Das Camden Court Hotel bildete den Abschluss einer dreiwöchigen Irlandtour, auf der wir einige Hotels und eine Pension kennenlernten. In unserer persönlichen Rangliste liegt dieses Hotel eindeutig auf dem letzten Platz.
