211,A Well Oiled Machine that Excels Experience,"A Super 5 Star Experience.
From Driving into the Carpark to Walking into the Reception every minute was exceptional.
The decor, the comfort, the facilities and the staff made our stay just incredible.
The rooms were spacious, well presented and completely spotless. The bar drinks, the meal in the restaurant and  the breakfast were were all top class and the staff in every department from the Door Staff, Reception and Housekeeping who  were all such a professional well presented friendly team total made the experience and so it’s hard to single out any department but the food and beverage department mixed of young and older were outstanding. They were so busy over the 24 hours of our stay and they worked and worked and worked so hard and they smiled and were so courteous to all from early to late under enormous volume of numbers, hats off to them.",5,2024,09,02
211,A great hotel,"We had a wonderful stay for my sister’s graduation at Croke Park. The hotel was great. Nick Cunningham, in particular was really helpful. We had Alex as our host in the restaurant and he was just great, couldn’t do enough for us, calm, professional and helpful. Really recommend this hotel",5,2024,10,18
211,The Sideline Restaurant,"Evrim Polat was an amazing server. She was polite, efficient and very friendly. I have had a few bad experiences with service here before and Evrim has completely changed my mind. She is an assist to the Croke Park Hotel. I will definitely be back!! 10/10",5,2024,10,18
211,Restaurant service,"Ervim Polat was amazing with her service! So attentive, friendly and welcoming. An asset to your company. Service was great , food was lovely, really enjoyed the experience overall. Place was absolutely spotless too. Great experience all together",5,2024,10,18
211,One night stay,"This was a single night stay, while we didn’t get to use the various facilities of the hotel the service we received by the staff we did meet was very helpful and friendly. The rooms were spacious and well laid out. The bed was a little too soft for me so sleep wasn’t great but everything else was great. We will happily stay again",4,2024,10,16
211,Croke Hotel Park,"Great Service, comfortable Hotel, and good Breakfast. Everyone was fast and efficient and the rooms were very welcoming and good to sleep and relax at the end of the day.",5,2024,10,16
211,"Clean, comfortable and nice","My wife and I stayed at The Croke Park for the first 2 days of our trip. This was our third time staying at this hotel. The hotel staff was friendly and helpful when we arrived. We did arrive early and asked if we could park our rental until check in time. It turns out that our room was ready early so they checked us in! 

The hotel has a great lounge area in the lobby, and a nice modern bar. Parking is conveniently located below the hotel and they take guest security very seriously. The rooms were clean, very comfortable and modern. My wife and I loved the nespresso maker in addition to the standard kettle. 

The Croke Park Hotel is within walking distance to so many of the sights of Dublin, so there’s no need to drive and park. My wife and I walked everywhere we wanted to go as we had done the previous two times. We hope to return again soon and stay while in Dublin.",4,2024,10,12
211,Very unfriendly reception staff and location a let down,"A hotel for young people or people who drive. No facilities whatsoever in the area restaurants or pubs. Long walk to nearest bus stop 12 minutes no Luas service so if you don’t drive you have to factor in Taxi fares 
Very clean hotel and breakfast very good.
Staff in restaurant were helpful but reception staff I would consider to be very poor and were not very helpful gave a bad impression of the hotel from the time we arrived.
Hotel not suited to older people",4,2024,09,25
211,Hotel is wonderful,"The hotel is fabulous, and all the staff are wonderful, Caroline who waited on us at the bar on Sunday night was amazing with us and our children.

The breakfast is very good, it is worth savoring every moment of the hotel

When I return to Dublin, I really want to have the same experience at the Hotel again.",5,2024,09,24
211,Terrible,On arrival we were told that the bar and restaurant were out of bounds as they were taken over by a large private function. Later on we found that this large function had spilled into the lobby. It was packed on very loud. We were brought to a room at the back of the hotel for dinner. It turns out this room was just behind the bar where the party was! It was the noisiest dinner of my life! Staff and party goers kept coming through the connecting door and leaving  it open. It was like eating in a disco. The individual staff were nice but the overall dining experience was appalling.  Then after we went to bed we had the pleasure of being kept awake well into the night by the same private party which was now in the hotel courtyard under our window. Most hotels I am familiar with hold functions such as this in proper function room away from other guests. I don't want to blame individual staff members who were mostly very nice but  I feel deeply disappointed with this hotel.,1,2024,09,22
211,"Short stay in Dublin with family to explore some local attractions, in the late Summer sunshine",Short stay in Dublin with family to explore some of the local attractions in the late summer sunshine ,5,2024,09,19
211,Avoid!,"Absolutely ridiculous charging 525e to stay for the Coldplay concert considering how much this hotel costs on a normal night. To my horror 3 days after my stay my card was charged 3 times totally 1575e for one night!!! Contacted the hotel who said they would refund me my money and half of the original amount for the error, it seems it was all lies to get me off the phone since I only got back the money taken in error and nothing else. My emails are currently being ignored and I am left with multiple charges from my bank and service providers due to unpaid direct debits. Avoid at all costs and if you staying there do not use your card!",1,2024,09,16
211,Family experience,"Are stay at the Crime Park Hotel was excellent, it included family room, evening 3 Corse meal,  breakfast and family tickets to Dublin Zoo.  Children absolutely enjoyed the experience.",5,2024,09,16
211,Fairly dismal area of Dublin,"Hotel is nice enough, room was clean and had both a shower and separate tub. Our rate included a nice breakfast, buffet style.

But the neighborhood is dismal. No restaurants/pubs/shops nearby.  So it was quiet and we slept well in a comfortable bed. ",3,2024,09,11
211,Nice hotel.. but,"The minute we got Coldplay tickets, I booked this hotel, 480 for one night (utterly ridiculous). But a bucket list concert! 
To then be charged €20 on leaving car park felt like a complete kick in the teeth,  on our booking details this was not mentioned. Surely, when charging this much money, one could at least expect to park the car free or charge. Nice hotel, spoiled by greed.",3,2024,09,07
211,Outstanding in every way,"Fabulous hotel, loved it! We chose the Croke Park as it includes free secure parking if you book direct, and if you sign up to the Doyle Group newsletter it releases some cracking deals. For a 4 star hotel in Dublin with parking and breakfast for 2, it was a no brainer. Our room wasn't ready when we arrived but we were given a free drink each in the lounge bar and only had to wait 10 minutes, nice gesture. The room was lovely and absolutely spotless as was the whole hotel. Bath and separate walk in shower was a bonus. If you are fortunate enough to get a room on the 4th floor you get free access to an executive lounge with comfy chairs, sofas, free water tea coffee pastries and fruit. Great if you need to work during your stay. Location is great, a taxi is €10-15 into all the popular spots although there is good public transport available just outside. 
Breakfast was very very enjoyable with a full range of food. Local bacon sausages and black pudding, fried and scrambled eggs (poached available on request), hash browns,beans, mushrooms, toast, coffee, juice, hard to beat a proper Irish fry! Loads of cereals, bread, fruit etc also available.
We only stayed one night to see Riverdance but will definitely be back for a longer stay to explore Dublin more.",5,2024,09,07
211,Bit expensive ,"Great location if you are going to a concert.  Carpark is under the hotel which was a great bonus. Room was clean and tidy. 
Bit expensive to stay mind you.
Breakfast was great. Really could not find any faults in my stay. 
Yes I would go back if I was going to see another concert in croke park",4,2024,09,02
211,Super staff and BBQ,"Can't say enough nice things about the staff in this hotel. Went there before coldplay, accidently booked bbq for wrong day, but the super efficient and friendly staff ensured that we got a table. Food fab and wad an excellent way to relax before the concert. Thank you all. Highly recommend. ",5,2024,09,01
211,Concert time,"If your going to a concert in crokepark this is the place to stay. Mind you it's expensive.  Great location friendly staff clean and tidy.. easy carparking under the hotel 
",5,2024,09,01
211,Coldplay Overnighter,"This hotel is superbly located at Croke Park, easy walking distance to local restaurants & bars too. 

Rooms were quiet, clean, cosy & comfortable.  Would highly recommend if you can afford the inflated prices during big gigs, but more of a treat than a regular thing as too expensive.  Lovely bars, live music, good food and friendly staff.  Easy peasy 😊👍",5,2024,08,31
211,Fab stay as always,Wonderful hotel to stay in....Rooms spotless. Food excellent. Staff so professional. Always greeted with a smile and have 100% customer service.  Only hotel to go to when visiting Dublin.  ,5,2024,08,29
211,Disappointing after previous good visits,"Stayed for one night last night. Room was fine but it had no fridge which I've had on previous stays. Shower was also lukewarm this morning. Staff generally very good and a particular mention for the lovely French lady in the restaurant for breakfast who was also there on my previous visits and is just so friendly, hospitable and couldn't do enough for us. My biggest disappointment was checking out this morning . A lady staff member who seemed totally disinterested, barely spoke and never asked if we had a nice stay. That's a big red flag in my opinion. Hotel definitely scores for location, cleanliness, really nice bar and lounge areas etc and great to have the parking too but I'm sorry to say the customer service definitely let it down on this occasion. ",3,2024,08,26
211,Consistently Outstanding,"Excellent service throughout, as ever. Rooms are spotlessly clean and extremely comfortable. The decor is tasteful and refined and public areas, tranquil and spacious. The food is outstanding and the level of attention to individual requirements much appreciated. Gluten free croissants were offered at breakfast, along with superior quality gluten free toast. Delicious chocolate sorbet and vegan ice cream are also available. Fabulous Goan curry and steak sandwich with gluten free ciabatta. Good selection of excellent wine.  
Convenient location for the city, airport and, of course, events at Croke Park. Secure on site parking. Always a pleasure to stay at the Croke Park Hotel. I look forward to my next visit.",5,2024,08,25
211,Concert night,"I stayed with my family at the Croke Park Hotel for the AC/DC concert. Overall, it was a very pleasant experience. The rooms were lovely and very clean. The breakfast service was excellent, especially thanks to a staff member named Miriam, who helped my kids get pancakes and other items from the buffet. I will definitely come back",5,2024,08,23
211,Our stay at the hotel,"We booked this hotel, as it was right next door to the Croke park stadium where
AC/DC were playing. Although the prices for the hotel had doubled We had an amazing stay here. All staff were friendly. The bedroom exceeded our expectations. Very large room with bathroom having a separate bath and shower in it. The beds were extremely comfortable as well as the pillows. Everything you needed. Hotel was very spacoius with lots of comfortable different seating areas. The proximity of this hotel was a short taxi drive away from city centre costing around €10 and other places of interest. ",5,2024,08,19
211,Lovely place to stay in Dublin,"This is a lovely hotel. It is not close to the city center, but the rooms are comfortable, the breakfast buffet is fine. The best part of the hotel is the staff. Incredibly helpful, always going the extra mile. Enjoyed the stay very much. It came at the end our stay, quiet and restful.",5,2024,08,15
211,Disappointing Stay,"Had a 1 night stay in Croke Park Hotel. I feel I got a good deal to include breakfast dinner and overnight stay. I can't fault the bedroom, bed, bathroom and all of the Hotel in terms of cleanliness and comfort. However I felt staff weren't overly welcoming and friendly apart from the staff at the bar who actually were friendly. It might be professional to be business like in greeting guests but a little bit of warmth from staff wouldn't go a miss. We had lunch on arrival and had to wait 45 minutes for 2 club sandwiches. Our tea arrived after ordering lunch but we then had a 45 minute wait till sandwiches arrived. The restaurant certainly wasn't overly busy at the time and no staff made any effort to see why we weren't being served our food or on arrival of food did they explain why it was so late in coming. When I asked for fresh pot of tea it was greeted with disdain as to why we needed fresh ""hot"" tea as the previous round had got cold in the 45 minutes. On paying for lunch no apologies were made for such a long delay.  Price was certainly  high. As I had dinner included in booking we ate in restaurant again that evening. Service had improved and food was good. Think a few more options could be on the menu. Next morning we were down for breakfast it was usual choices of healthy continental or full Irish.  The fruit bowl was empty and when I asked if there was more chopped fruit I was told to look in other dining room there wasn't any there either and it wasn't being replenished.  The hot food certainly wasn't hot it was being kept warm in covered food trays with gas flame underneath.  It certainly wasn't hot. This hotel is good location for doing the Croke Park Tour or Guinness Storehouse tour. But I am disappointed with the overall stay. Would I recommend it honestly don't think so and I don't think I would make a return visit.  🤔",2,2024,08,15
211,Absolutely amazing,"I can't imagine a better place to stay within this price range. It really exceeded our expectations. Clean, comfortable, relatively close to the city center, and most of all, legendary staff. Honestly, can't say anything bad about our stay. Absolutely great. ",5,2024,08,13
211,Good hotel,"It 's a good hotel..the rooms are clean and the attention is so good
Good restaurant.
The location its far to de Dublin center,but ther's a parking in the hotel",3,2024,08,11
211,Family stay,"Family of 5 stayed during a busy all ireland final Sunday. Staff were excellent throughout. Room excellent, service prompt and staff very attentive. Room service food was lovely. All in all, a lovely experience. Thank you all ",5,2024,08,06
211,Lovely hotel but let down by poor provision for triple occupancy,"Hotel clean and lovely decor. Staff friendly and helpful, especially the bar staff. Range of food in the bar was just ok, and the quality of the food was good but not excellent. But we booked a triple room as travelling with my 11 year old child and the third bed was a camp bed of very poor quality. He could feel the wires through the very thin mattress. We asked for, and were given an extra mattress for it but it was still a very uncomfortable night's sleep. Given the cost of staying in hotels at the minute, it is not good that all occupants don't get a comfortable bed. The main bed though was fab and the room was lovely so as long as you don't need the extra bed, I'd recommend this hotel.",3,2024,08,05
211,Classy hotel,"This was our favorite hotel experience on our trip to Europe. It was classy, the beds were amazingly comfortable. Having the stadium across from us -Wow!",5,2024,08,03
211,We loved the hotel,"The waiter Joao was super friendly and attentive in the restaurant during dinner, was very nice to us talking with someone that nigth! the entire team served us very well. and the receptionist spoke Portuguese was also super cool, I Didn’t remember her name but she was from France!",5,2024,08,02
211,Cozy and comfortable restaurant,"Had a cozy night in the Croke park hotel restaurant enjoying  dinner with my coworkers.  And Joao took wonderful care of  all us. Absolutely friendly, professional and very attentive. I am looking forward to the next time I come back to enjoy a meal here. However, do not order the macaroni and cheese.",5,2024,08,01
211,"Comfortable,  friendly hotel","It was a real pleasure to stay in this hotel.  The room was clean and well presented with a very comfortable bed and good services staff were really professional and friendly, our waiter Federico was extremely good and looked after us well throughout our meal. Would highly recommend this hotel for business or leisure stays.",5,2024,07,30
211,Great stay,Fabulous stay in a comfortable hotel with professional staff and good services. Good value and convenient with parking and easy walk into the city ,5,2024,07,28
211,Excellent Hotel,We really enjoyed our two nights stay at the Croke Park Hotel.  All of the staff we encountered were extremely helpful and courteous. Our room was very spacious and clean. The bed was very comfortable. The food both in the bar and restaurant was excellent. The choice of menu for breakfast and dinner was great. Well done!,5,2024,07,27
211,Match day drinks,Had a great time at the match regardless of Cork not winning! :( It was a busy bar and I was impressed with how the staff handled all us wild culchies. I don't know how they do it. A lovely lady called Miriam went out of her way to get the table drinks and coffees and I helped her translate the Cork language! Fair play to Miriam for her hard work all the service staff.,4,2024,07,25
211,"Lovely hotel, so convenient on all Ireland day!",Stayed on all Ireland day and it was great to relax in the room until we needed to go to the match! Room was spacious and clean. Top class hotel! ,5,2024,07,23
211,Very disappointed for a 4 star,"First of all this isent something I’d usually do but after paying nearly 500 a night for a 4 star hotel I was left very unpleased. 
After booking this hotel for an all Ireland final after our county had It I decided that we would go and splash out on all Ireland final weekend. No issues checking in until it came to the night going to bed 
1: when we turned on the air conditioning it was squeaking and definitely in need of a refurb so we couldn’t keep it on over the noise making the room well over temperature. 
2: the shower was totally leaking on to the bathroom floor so we had to leave towels on the floor constantly to soak up the water
3: I do understand that this weekend was fully booked out but since we arrived on Saturday morning to when we checked out Monday the floor in the bar had never seen a mop and as you were walking to breakfast your shoes would stick to the floor

And i hate complaining as im usually very easy going and you may think these are stupid things but if your paying over 450 a night for a 4 star hotel surely the standards would be a lot higher 

Really disappointed in this as we were really looking forward to the stay 

Regards 
Kelvin",2,2024,07,22
211,Family stay,Great family stay. Excellent location to croke park. Could be slightly cheaper on match days. Will definitely return,5,2024,07,15
211,Amazing service,We ate in the Hawthorne restaurant while staying in this hotel and had absolutely brilliant service from our lovely waitress Fiona. We felt so well-looked after and to top it all off our meal was delicious. Professional and homely. Thank you!!,5,2024,07,11
211,👎,"Worse hotel ever and i do drone work for 4+5 star hotels all over Ireland, the bar manager wasn't very nice today... 
I wouldn't recommend to anyone as the food was very average aswell, bit of a let down concerning its location, i will not be back!!!!!!",1,2024,07,07
211,The best hotel we've stayed at in Dublin.,The room was absolutely spotless and the staff were very friendly. Check in was quick and efficient. The food was excellent in the bar and the cocktails we had at the end of the night were very well made. We will definitely be back to stay again.,5,2024,07,06
211,Fantastic stay at a fantastic hotel l,"We had the most fantastic stay at this hotel. We were greeted at reception by Eoin who went over and beyond to help us with check in and booking an extra night. We got the same room for our two nights stay even though it was very last minute and it being Gaa weekend. 
The bar staff and breakfast staff were excellent and worked very well together under pressure.
The beds and pillows were super comfortable, we had the best sleep. The bathroom was large with a choice of a shower and bath.
Housekeeping had our room refreshed early Saturday morning while we went shopping and strolling.
We thoroughly enjoyed out stay here and will be recommending this hotel to anyone travelling to Dublin.",5,2024,07,06
211,Highly recommend,"Great Hotel  walking distance to town. It is directly opposite Croke park too. The parking was excellent and it was easy to find. 

Lovely breakfast, mix of hot food and continental. The kids had pancakes and waffles. 

The room had a shower and bath. Which gets it extra points. We had a room opposite the elevator and I thought we would be disturbed all night but not even once.",5,2024,06,29
211,It would be good...,"...if all would work well and problems would be solved properly.
I know that it is sometimes hard to find a quiet room where everything is working, because my wife and I travel a lot.  Therefore we are happy when we find a good hotel with good rooms. This was the reason why we canceled our booking of the castle hotel and decided to stay at the Croke Park Hotel when we came back to Dublin 10 days later. When we booked the second stay we asked to get the same room (237) which was quiet and all was working. The receptionist told us it would be ok . When we arrived the second time (June 26) they told us we cannot have the desired room and gave us room 223. In this room the shower did not work (low pressure and only lukewarm), so we asked for fixing. They offered another room which was a twin instead a double, more noisy and with the same shower problem.  So we stood in the 223. But the maintenance was not able to solve the problem and we had to stay three days with bad shower.",2,2024,06,28
211,Fabulous hotel,"From start to finish, our stay was fabulous, from check in, the room, the breakfast, dinner in the restaurant and the staff, everything was exceptional.  My husband had to stay in hospital and it was no bother to get a late check out.
The hotel was very near the bus stop when we got bus from the airport.",5,2024,06,28
211,Good place,"The hotel was good, nice staff, easy access by walking and near an airport bus stop. Though the AC wasn't working and I haven't been made aware of it until I told them. ",4,2024,06,27
211,"Come for room, stay for the staff.","What an amazing few days. Our second stay at this hotel and won't be our last! The room was spacious and impeccably clean. A massive shout out to the bar staff, especially Federico, Appolina and Laurent. Cocktails here are made perfectly and bar staff will even go above and beyond to make something to your liking. Who knew a tequila daiquiri would be better than the traditional?! Honestly an amazing trip and cannot wait to come back!",5,2024,06,26
211,Fantastic federico,"We really enjoyed our stay here, if you go to the hotel bar, Federico was absolutely fantastic can’t recommend him enough as a bartender, exceptional customer service. Laurent went above and beyond to create a cocktail for my girlfriend and even taught me something about cocktails (I’m a cocktail bartender for over a decade), tequila daiquiri just wow. All the hotel staff were so friendly, the price of a pint of Guinness is 7 euros, cheapest we found on our stay. Hotel food was great. Rooms were so clean, we travel a lot but not a single fault on cleanliness. This is the second time we’ve spent here and by far our most enjoyable thanks to federico, Laurent and Appolina (I hope I spelt her name correctly). If the shower pressure was the same as the bath I would genuinely live here. Location was perfect for our visit as we were walking distance for a concert in town and from fairview. Thanks for making our holiday so amazing. The staff made it! Will definitely be back a third time.",5,2024,06,26

We came back to the hotel after a day of shopping and wondering around Dublin to eat dinner.  My wife had Chicken Caesar Salad.  She it was very good and they were very generous with the chicken.  I ordered a hamburger and it was extremely good.  The sauce that they put on the burger is amazing.  We learned that they made it in house.  Our waiter, Frederico took excellent care of us.

211,"Excellent hotel, let down by the food.","Great hotel, friendly attentive staff, let down by the food.
Not too long a wait at a busy check in time and was pleasantly surprised to be upgraded to a room with a balcony and a great view of the wonderful stadium. 
The balcony itself however hadn’t been cleaned in a while and contained several cigarette butts & could have done with a wipe down. 
The bed was amazingly comfortable and a pleasure to relax in after a long day in Dublin

An advertised vegan/vegetarian menu did not in fact exist upon rocking up for our dinner reservation and I’m afraid the food was a big let down to an otherwise very good hotel. 
Next day at breakfast I ordered porridge which came with skin along the top and was inedible and tasteless. 
Didn’t bother with the dinner reservation the next night and ate in town.

Would definitely recommend and I hope they improve on the dining experience.",4,2024,06,20
211,Another great stay,Exceptional stay once again in the Croke Park I'm getting addicted to good service lol 😆 check in was simple the rooms are lovely bright and comfortable I spent an hour in the gym which is modern and exceptionally clean had my meeting along with dinner and after had a nightcap just great 👍 👌,5,2024,06,18

211,June Overnight Stay,"Excellent hotel, wonderful room, efficient and courteous staff. It was the perfect location to stay before an early morning flight out of Dublin Airport.",5,2024,06,13
211,Sensational Dublin Hotel,"Stayed in The Croke Park Hotel for 5 nights beginning of June whilst my wife was in hospital for an operation. First time I’ve stayed in any hotel on my own so a little apprehensive. 
No need to worry at all.
All the staff were lovely, friendly and welcoming.
Breakfast consisted of a buffet style setup with almost everything you could imagine, you could see food being prepared in the kitchen ( spotless).
The lunchtime and evening meals were superb, rooms were cleaned daily, towels changed daily if you required. 
Tea and Coffee available in your room and fresh bottles of water every day .
Underground secure parking for piece of mind.
All in All 
A great hotel to stay in

The carpark was included in te room price and this was an added bonus. We just got an uber or walked anywhere we needed to go.",5,2024,06,02
211,A taste of luxury at affordable prices,"From arriving early and getting early check in, our interactions with the staff, and especially this evening dining at the Hawthorn, everything has been very impressive. Good food and drink, a general feel of luxury, for good value for money.

Federico and Gemma's service was second to none, helping us celebrate a work milestone for my wife.

Absolutely would recommend and rebook ourselves.",5,2024,05,31
211,Highs and Lows,"We chose The Croke Park based on reviews and location when booking a hotel for the night in Dublin.  And in some areas, The Croke Park did not disappoint.  

The front desk service was courteous and attentive.  We arrived without luggage because it was still at the airport.  The hotel provided us with 'Dental Kits' which were very much appreciated.

The rooms were nicely appointed and comfortable.  Although it was a rainy and cool day outside, I still like the room to be cool and the thermostat in the room went down to 16 Celsius.

Our visit to The Croke Park's bar is where things started to be amiss.  Every table in the bar was taken, however, after taking our drink order, the waiter seemed to forget about us.  After 15 minutes, we went to the bar and spoke to a waitress.  She sent our waiter back over who apologized for the wait and told us he would get our drinks.  When?  He still had not brought us water we asked for.  He didn't really seem to be concerned.  Five minutes later he brought our drinks.  No water.

We needed to leave early in the morning to get back to the airport.  I parked the rental car in the complimentary car park the night before.  While my family members went to the front desk to check out, I went down to the garage to get the car.  Pulling up to the exit did not open the large metal roll-up door.  I had to get out of the car and push an intercom button.  After the third push, the door began to open.  I pulled up next to the kiosk to scan my ticket or room card to open the barrier.  It told me I needed to pay 20 Euros.  After 10 minutes and multiple attempts to satisfy the kiosk, The Croke Park's security guy shows up and tells me the arm would not go up because I had not satisfied the front desk with my parking ticket.  He seemed to be scolding me.  Told me  it's all about security.  Really?!  You knew I was here (my family is in the lobby waiting for me and I had pushed the intercom button to get the door raised).  He radioed someone and the arm went up.

I drove around to the front where my family was and went into the lobby where the security guy and two other guys were behind the counter.  I put my room key down with the parking ticket and asked them which of my credit cards they wanted to satisfy the parking.  They seemed stunned to see me.  After a few taps on the computer, the guy tells me we were checked out and there was nothing owed.  I was pissed.  I made a comment to the security guy about making me go through some archaic process to get the car out for no reason.  We left.",3,2024,05,30
211,Magnificent experience definitely will be back,"Our go to hotel, very professional, friendly, exceptional standards which are consistent over the last number of years we’ve had the pleasure of staying with Sean and his team. Can’t recommend this hotel enough, bed, bathrooms, breakfast, attention to detail 5 star",5,2024,05,29
211,Nice city centre hotel,"Stayed for two nights with two friends in a triple room. Really liked this hotel, reasonably priced (for Dublin) with a nice restaurant/bar and location is nice for heading into the city centre or out towards the airport. Would stay again if visiting Dublin.",5,2024,05,26
211,Good hotel with great potenial.,"Second stay at the Croke Park Hotel. I stayed there for 6 nights in a suite with complememtary access to the lounge.
At first I want to say Thank you to the great staff in all departements. Specially Mr. Lewandowski was great and all time he do the best what he can. 
The suite is nice and have 2 rooms. The maintence and cleaness could be better, but overall is a good price-value balance.
The Lounge with complimentary softdrinks, coffee and a small breakfast some fruits and sometimes pastry in the afternoon is very very poor. No one has an eye for this great oppotunity to satisfy premium guests. 
I toll the operator that the water machine needs a service men because the co2 was empty. 3 working days in a row nothing happend. We I left the hotel the issue was still active. In the evening you don't get any pastry. Just at one day they forget to take the breakfast pastry away so they stand the the whole day. Also the range of softdrinks was no range. Just masses of still water.
Please take more care for the area.
The pre booked experiences (GHA) worked pretty well and the value for the money was very very good. 
The breakfast was ok but when you stay longer than 2 nights it's getting boring. The staff was so so. Between very friendly and with an open eye to please don't talk to me. Also the eye for the buffet when it's busy need more attention because many things goes empty and the kitchen don't know that they have to reproduce the food in front and so was the time of emptiness to long for a pretty crowded breakfast room. I can say much more but it will take to long.
What I also don't like when the GM walks thru the Hotel and don't greet the guests with a Hello or something else.
The staff at front desk are very friendly and helpful in the restaurants it was also so so. But the restaurant manager was very nice because he made an easy drink for me what was not on the menu and gave the recipe to the bar that they can create the easy drink when he is not in charge. This was very nice.
The quality of the food was in The sideline very good and tasty. In the more elegant and exclusiv The Hawthorn restaurant was weak for the price.
But overall I would come back because of Mr. Lewandowski and the friendly restaurant manager. It's a little bit like comming home. But just a little bit.",4,2024,05,26
211,Gemma was incredible!,"The outdoor/indoor space was very pleasant with heaters and blankets that really weren’t necessary but available just in case. Gemma was so wonderful and happy, it made our experience that much more special. Highly recommend this one for anyone.",5,2024,05,25

211,Great service,"Frederico went above and beyond to assure our wine was delicious and fresh!
When our wine was not fresh he brought a whole new bottle and poured a taste to be sure it was good. Kind and courteous service throughout the evening.

211,Fabulous stay!,"My husband, daughter and I had such an amazing time at The Croke Park Hotel. The room was lovely. We had dinner in the Hawthorn, I had smoked salmon and Guinness bread for starter and steak for main, it was all delicious. They also had a great children's menu. There was a good range of choices for breakfast, the bircher pots, croissants and full Irish breakfast were lovely. The service was very helpful and friendly. There was a big rugby match on at the Croke Park stadium opposite (perfect location, if you are watching a match there) and there was a brilliant atmosphere in the bar with the match on and then live music. The location was also good for sightseeing round Dublin. Overall a fabulous stay!",5,2024,05,17

211,Excellent Experience,"We stayed at The Croke Park in May 2024. This hotel will be a favorite now and for future visits. I can’t wait to bring my family. From the warm greetings when you enter the building to the kind and quick service when we had a special request. I can’t compliment the staff enough.  However, Alex stood out! He made our dinner special. He was very attentive, friendly and professional. The food was delicious but Alex took it over the top.
Thank you everyone at The Croke Park for a wonderful visit to Dublin.",5,2024,05,10
211,Amazing experience,"We had the pleasure of attending the record breaking rugby semi in Croke park. 
The stadium is incredible and there were 82300 people in attendance. 
The loos bars etc were well staffed and great food! 
The only downside was not being allowed to bring alcoholic drinks to your seat when people had hot drinks and minerals! 
An incredible experience and of course our team Leinster win!",5,2024,05,08
211,Great stay,"We had a great one night stay at the croke park hotel. We went to the zoo and came back and had dinner in the bar we were served by Joao who was so friendly and kind to us and our boys. I enjoyed his humour and he returned to our table during our meal to see if we were ok for everything. 
The bedroom was lovely, clean spacious and real value for money. The room was near the lift which I like when travelling with the kids as they are not running up and down the corridor. When inside the room you can hear nothing from outside the door.
The reception staff were very nice and professional, quick in checking us in and again in the morning checking us out. We had a tour of croke park booked and was able to leave the car in the car park until we were finished which was great of us. 
Nothing was a problem, we really enjoyed our stay and the boys loved it also. 
I would definitely return and stay here again. 
Thanks Croke park hotel, great value for money and nice friendly staff all round.",4,2024,05,07

The foyer is beautiful with lots of seating areas and little nooks  , we enjoyed drinks in the bar which had a great atmosphere and a lovely courtyard. Our room was very clean very comfy beds and pillows. The bathroom was stocked with all the essentials , handy when u forgot your shampoo and conditioner. The main reason I would book again is the staff , who were both friendly and accommodating. Check in took a matter of minutes everything had been prepared and check out was just as quick. The bar staff were welcoming and friendly and the household staff always took time to say hello and good morning. Overall very happy with our stay and would book again when we are staying in Dublin. We did not eat at the restaurant so can’t review  but the breakfast was delicious and had plenty of choice.",5,2024,04,28

211,Outstanding Stay!,"The Croke is my favorite hotel when visiting Dublin. Clean, spacious rooms with delightfully scented soaps and lotions are just a start. The friendly and knowledgeable staff provide outstanding customer assistance and service. The restaurant is by far my favorite especially for the tasty breakfast buffet. I have to order a porridge with honey and fruit every morning. For dinner, Frederico, my server suggested the most delicious toasty I’ve ever eaten. My hats off to him and the chefs for providing amazing service with a smile and fabulous food. In addition, the Irish Coffee at the bar should not be missed! Thanks for a superb stay. See you soon.",5,2024,04,12
211,🍀🍀🍀🍀🍀,"I love this hotel. It went through some changes during Covid (didn't we all?), but I'm happy to see it return to the high level of customer service I've come to expect.

I will come again for sure and suggest it.",5,2024,04,10
211,Memorable Easter Weekend,"Stayed at The Croke Park Hotel over the Easter weekend, while taking in the four football league finals across the road at Croke Park Stadium. It was therefore a weekend I was really looking forward to as not only did it double as a welcome Easter break, it was also an early Birthday treat.

  I must admit that I had high expectations for my stay, and thankfully it didn't disappoint. The room was spotlessly clean, and had a lot going for it. The tea making facilities were excellent, with a variety of teas, coffee and Hot Chocolate available. The room also came with a large tv, which had the added bonus of having the sports channels, while also having the ability to stream from your phone to the tv. There was also bottles of water in the room which were a great bonus as was the mini fridge. The bathroom too was spotlessly clean and well stocked. The room was also incredibly quiet and the location also meant  that there were no outside noise issues even on a busy match weekend.

  It's clear that the entire staff take great pride in their work here and I think that shows throughout. It helps create a really welcoming atmosphere  around the place and that helps put anxiety ridden guests such as myself at ease. Due to the busy nature of the weekend, I didn't venture to the bar or restaurant so I can't comment on them but I am eager to return here in the future and will surely sample the delights they have to offer then.",5,2024,04,05
211,A wonderful hotel in Dublin,"Luxury hotel with spacious and clean rooms. One of the few places with air control (heat and air) in the room.

So happy we picked this place for our arrival to Ireland.",5,2024,04,04

We didn't get our sever's name at Hawthorne on Friday, but he was so amazing too!",5,2024,03,30
211,Dangerous Shower,Charged €15 for parking at check in and informed this was because I booked through booking.com but would have been free if booked direct?? Scalding hot shower that could not be cooled with mixer so unable to shower and no apologies or compensation offered in turn. No soda bread at breakfast despite being listed. No Guinness 0.0 in stock. Not informed or asked if car park ticket needed validation even though I was charged immediately on check in so had to return to desk to get it done. ,1,2024,03,29

211,The wonderful Joao Picciatelli in restaurant,"We stayed at the wonderful Croke Park Hotel for business.  Our check in was super, our room was wonderful, extremely comfortable, bed and pillows amazing.  What made our trip to the hotel excellent was the wonderful service from Joao Picciatelli in the bar/restaurant.  This young gentleman is such an asset to the hotel.  From the moment we arrived in the restaurant Joao greeted us with such a wonderful smile, excellent service from a member of staff who is clearly very happy with their job.  We travel all over Ireland for work, and we both agree Joao was one of the most wonderful members of hotel staff we have met.  Well done Joao and well done The Croke Park hotel for such a wonderful experience, so many hotels could learn from such an excellent example you are setting.  Keep up the amazing work !!!

211,Great stay!,"Nice, clean and comfy. Only downside is that you have to walk 20 min to get to the city center and that the hotel restaurant closes at 10pm. They only do sandwiches after that time.
Overall though, it was a great stay!",5,2024,03,26
211,Michael Fox,I was very surprised by the last minute price as i booked less than 36 hours earlier. The accessibility by the rail network suited my trip as I had a conference with in the Helix where a taxi fare was reasonable. Very good.,5,2024,03,25
211,Parking fee,Stayed there last weekend & had to pay to park. It must be a new policy as i stay often here & never had to pay. I didn’t see it on their website either. €15 isn’t too bad it’s just I didn’t know about it.,5,2024,03,25

211,Great hotel,"Stayed here when over visiting Dublin, hotel is excellent, trendy but classy, spotlessly clean. We arrived early and were able to check in at no extra cost. Staff are very friendly and welcoming. 
If you’re wanting a hotel near the main bars and nightlife then it’s not for you, although it’s only around 20 euros for a taxi to them so not the worst. 
Croke park is literally on your doorstep if you plan on going to an event there then this is ideal. 
The bed and pillows are the comfiest I’ve ever slept on. Rooms are amazing. 
Overall I’d definitely recommend staying here and would return.

211,Lovely hotel to stay in :),My husband and I stayed here for one night and really enjoyed our stay. The hotel is modern with a beautiful aesthetic and our room was clean and had everything we needed. The hotel bar was nice and the food very good. We had burgers which weren't cheap but I think that's every restaurant now if you don't want to eat in McDonalds. The hotel is literally across the road from the stadium so would be a great place to stay if you are going to a game. I would definitely recommend this hotel :),5,2024,03,06
211,Croke Park - advised but don't eat out of the menu,"Good hotel, gym was open even during the night, very friendly receptionists. Only 2  things:
1) the thermostate was set high in the room and lowering it caused it to reset after a couple of hours back to the high setting. Irritating
2) Don't order out of the menu at the dinner area. A bowl of only vegetables they can't produce, you'll get a sidedish with some asperagus and some green beens, and that's it. Disappointing.",4,2024,03,03
211,Fabulous family stay,Most enjoyable family stay - room and breakfast both excellent- would highly recommend it for family stays. Have stayed alone previously for work too and also excellent from that perspective with good work facilities and quiet room.,5,2024,02,26
211,EXCELLENT HOTEL IN DUBLIN,"Very nice hotel, the staff were incredible, rooms are very nice and very clean.  It´s about 20 minutes walking from city centre. The hotel as a public parking (15€ per day) Will come back sometime soon.  Would like to mention that Mirna and Fátima were very helpful. ",5,2024,02,25
211,On entering our room we were surprised with a tiramasu cake and a card congratulating us on our wedding anniversary.,The hospitality and welcome is second to none. Beautiful comfy rooms. Breakfast is fantastic. We went there for our 54th wedding anniversary. We had stayed there previously a couple of times and will definitely be back again on our next trip to Dublin.,5,2024,02,21
211,"Amazing, Outstanding, Phenomenal - every time (Regular business stays)","I stay here 2 - 3 times per month, year round. 
I will once again reiterate the simplicity of staying at the Croke Park Hotel, along with the friendliness of each and every member of staff I have come into contact with. 
Nothing is ever a problem, the reception staff are excellent and check in is always a quick and easy process, the bar staff are always incredibly friendly, happy to chat and extremely knowledgeable. 
The breakfast team are second to none with no hold ups or delays. And of course, the reservation team and yourself, always quick to reply, advising work arounds and solutions and extremely flexible with dates etc. 
The rooms are always immaculate, the food second to none and the draught Guinness is impeccable.",5,2024,02,19
211,Amazing Host at the restaurant,"Dante our host was amazing to my crew. His service  impeccable and welcoming. federico, Patrick and rocisin was amazing as well. The service was so quick with the amount of orders the received. The ladies at the front desk was amazing and welcomin",5,2024,02,18
211,Croke Park Family Trip,"Two night stay in the Croke Park Hotel. Beautiful hotel. Very relaxing, free parking. Great location. Everything you could ask for. Food in the restaurant at breakfast and dinner scrumptious. Real orange juice, for me bits are okay, for others smooth orange juice (no bits) preferred. Staff at reception, breakfast and dinner very helpful. Overall loved it and will be back again and again and again and...",5,2024,02,16
211,A warm welcome in The Croke Park,We had a very pleasant stay in The Croke Park Hotel in mid February.  Our well-equipped room was spotless.  The hotel was quiet.  Breakfast was excellent  with probably the best croissants in town. There was a wonderful array of good quality food on offer. Bar food was tasty and available all day. Complimentary parking for residents is a major bonus.,5,2024,02,14
211,Lovely Stay at The Croke Park Hotel,Very welcoming and spotlessly clean hotel. Staff very friendly and very accomadating.We had dinner in the restaurant  and the food was first class. Breakfast next day was a buffet. It had everything  you wanted and the service was excellent in supplying  thectea and toast,5,2024,02,13
211,Perfect stay,"Not much more you would need when visiting Dublin
Good location
great hotel with everything you would need from underground parking to a beautiful breakfast
Helpful staff clean and modern rooms and reception areas ",5,2024,02,13
211,Great place to stay and very near Dublin city centte,"This was our second stay at the Croke Park Hotel. The room was superb and staff were extremely kind and I'd like to mention Fatima on reception who was super helpful.
I love the little area off reception - a little quiet area with seating and very relaxing. Thanks for a lovely stay !",5,2024,02,10
211,Fantastic hotel right across street from stadium,"This hotel is a fantastic hotel located directly across the street from the Croke Park stadium. The hotel itself has a very nice lobby with courteous and kind staff. Has a wonderful sprawling breakfast buffet as well. The hotel rooms are average size (but not too small) with comfortable beds and nice bathrooms. The heating and cooling also appears to work well. Although not really downtown Dublin and requires a long walk or Uber to get there. It’s perfect if you’re wanting to be near the stadium. I enjoyed my stay here very much, and would highly recommend it.",5,2024,02,09
211,Fantastic!!!,This hotel is fantastic! It is a little walk out from the city centre but really quiet as a consequence. The room was clean and spacious and the bed was very comfortable. My only complaint would be that there were no plugs on the left side of the bed. The breakfast was great as was the club sandwich we had one evening. It really has a luxury feel to it and the lobby had some great tucked away seating you could retreat to while enjoying a drink from the bar. It was reasonable priced too when compared with the city centre. I would very much recommend!,5,2024,02,05
211,Better than expected,"First time visiting Dublin and the Croke Park, our stary was first class from beginning to end. Staff were friendly and very helpful. Room was immaculate and breakfast was great.
We would recommend this hotel, it's in a quite area but easy access to city center. We will be back for sure!",5,2024,02,05
211,Great hotel with a very warm welcome,"Stayed here for 3 nights recently. Really enjoyed it. The rooms are fantastic with mini fridge, safe, and free bottled water included in the price. Bed was very comfortable and, having been staying in a number of “budget” hotels recently, coming back to a room that has been serviced each day is surprisingly comforting. The breakfast each morning was delicious and there were a vast range of option to suit every taste and dietary requirement. It kept me going until dinner. Speaking of dinner there were again a wide range options and you could choose the more formal restaurant setting or the very comfortable bar, both with great menu choices. 

The hotel is around a 15 minute walk from O’Connell street so it’s very convenient. There is also  underground parking in the hotel which is free if you book directly with them. Anyone who knows Dublin will appreciate that that can be a huge saving. The price I paid for B&B was very competitive in relation to other hotels of this class in any case so  the free parking is an added bonus.

Last, but certainly not least, were the staff. Each and every one of them were welcoming and warm, and that of course added to the overall feel and ambience in the hotel. I will be back.",5,2024,02,03
211,"The room is very big , clean and well equipped.","The hotel is on Perfect  location, essy acess to the city centre.

211,Very Good,"Spent 2 nights here recently.  Lovely hotel, room very clean. Shower wouldn't be the best.  Breakfast was top class. Evening meal of Cod and Chips was OK, not the best but also not the worst, didn't like the coating. ",4,2024,01,29
211,"Comfort, relaxing luxury","The rooms and hotel were excellent, the staff were brilliant and professional. The bar and restaurant were great, lovely tasting breakfast with plenty of variety.

211,Lovely stay at an exceptional hotel,"I thoroughly enjoyed my stay here from a Monday night to Friday morning. The hotel itself is beautiful on the inside and has a luxurious feel to it. It is about a 20 minute walk to the city centre but only a short walk to bus stops which would bring you there. There is also a spar shop, an off license and several takeaways within a 5 minute walk. The rooms are very spacious and comfortable, each containing a large tv with chromecast on it as well as a mini fridge. The beds are very large and comfortable and I got a good nights sleep each night. I would definitely recommend and I would 100% stay again. ",5,2024,01,20
211,Excellent,"Stayed here on numerous occasions and back again last night for a few days! Lovely hotel glad to see customer service hasn’t changed since the last time we were here.

Loved everything about this hotel.,5,2024,01,09

211,"Top tier, empathetic and exceptional service. ","Stayed two nights for my father's Kidney surgery at a nearby hospital. The staff were wonderfully accommodating, service was excellent and the rooms comfortable. Also a server, Hugo, was especially reassuring at a time of stress. Excellent all round. ",5,2024,01,05

211,compassion,"I have heard the best about this hotel so I decided to book a room. At Last I didn't manage to stay in the hotel due to sudden death in the family. When I informed them about they showed kindness and too much understanding. Surely, when I visit Dublin I will definitely stay in this hotel.",5,2024,01,04
211,Great stay with young family,"We stayed only for one night at Croke Park on our way to Belfast.  We travelled with young children who were tired and grouchy, the staff at the hotel were amazing and really helped us.  We stayed in large comfy beds, the room was clean and quiet.  Breakfast had a pretty good selection of vegetarian and dairy free options",5,2024,01,03
211,Breakfast disaster,"Very nice hotel, nice staff comfortable room.
One bad thing was breakfast. Had to queue for 15 minutes to get into breakfast area. Plenty of empty tables but none of them were cleared.  By the time we got in, there was very little food left. Got some cold tea and toast.  So bad that we didn't bother going down for our second morning.",3,2024,01,02
211,Good,"Nice hotel , very neat.  Less food options  menu. Service took more time to deliver especially during lunch time. , overall nice stay . Not far city center. Good ambiance.  Reception guys very good 👍 👌 👏 ",4,2023,12,31
211,Retirement night,This was a special event for our Principal who was retiring after 40 years of hard work and commitment to kids aged 5yrs to 12yrs old. The service was shabby to say the least. I would hesitate to recommend this hotel. ,1,2023,12,20
211,Don't reccommend,"Multiple issues with this hotel mainly the staff and the lack of service. When a customer is paying hundreds per night to stay in a hotel they expect a certain standard. The staff don't seem to have training/experience. We were told when we checked in that there was no dinner included in our reservation even though we questionned it we were told no so when we went up to the room we found the email confirmation and went back to reception to show a different member of staff who reassured us and apologised.We waited an hour between our starter and main course and had to alert a manager about this. Things didn't improve much we still waited a long time for dessert. All our cutlery was removed after our starter even though our dinner cutlery hadn't been used which we mentioned to the waiter and he laughed and removed it anyway without replacing it. When our dinner finally arrived there was no cutlery.
Breakfast the next day was no better, the food continuously ran out so did the plates. Not enough staff, no milk on tables for tea/coffee.
The beer (Heineken draft) in the Sideline bar was flat and had a funny taste and tried this on two occasions.
Needless to say we don't recommend this hotel and won't be back",2,2023,12,18
211,Usually good but noisy at christmas,"Normally a great base for the family, however at christmas it dosent seem to know weather its a nightclub or a hotel! Just check any room in the southnwest corner are above an outside bar that may play loud music until 1 am",1,2023,12,17
211,Best option value / price,"Hotel, rooms, staff service, cleannes and so on was perfect for a 2-3 night stay.
Located 20 min far walking from Dublin city center.
Expensive prices in their Bar&Resto.
I would definetly recommed it
",5,2023,12,12
211,A fantastic experience. All the details very careful.,"A fantastic experience. All the details very careful. The room was very clean. The atmosphere in the public spaces incredible. The staff very friendly. 
It takes about 20 minutes to walk from the hotel to O'connell street.",5,2023,12,07
211,Loved it,"I travel quite a lot and have stayed in many hotels and write quite a few reviews and if you have read any of my previous reviews you will see I am critical if things are not what they should be.
I can say I am struggling to give any negatives here, however....

There was  a cleansing issue and a mechanical issue in my room. However, when I raised this, I was immediately changed to another room and given 2 drinks vouchers due to inconvenience.
I found the pillows not to my liking and was not able to sleep very well to start either.
OK, negative done, let me list the good points, and there are quite a few.....
Firstly I arrived quite early in the morning not expecting to get in my room and was hoping I could leave a case in the luggage room whilst I got a coffee some where, not only was my room was ready I was allowed to go to it and I was also told my stay included access to the executive room which was lovely quiet and well stocked with drinks and lite bites.
My room was clean open, comfortable (apart from the pillows), and modern.
The whole hotel public areas were also very clean and modern.
TV included Sky Sports, and the rooms were serviced daily, with plenty of towels and toiletries, including a disposable dental kit and shaving kit and plenty of tea coffee and water in the rooms There was an iron and board in the room also.
Location about 30 minutes walk to the centre of Dublin.
Breakfast was included and probably the best breakfast I have had in a hotel.
Staff were a credit to the hotel, polite friendly and nothing seeming to much trouble from cleaners, bar and restaurant staff reception and managers.
In all, I loved my 3 night stay here, and should I return to Dublin, I would look to book to stay here.
The hotel has a lot of little touches that add to it, and it does not have 4 and a half stars for nothing. A lot of thought has gone into the running of the hotel, and I, for one, definitely appreciated it, so thank you for a nice stay.
Definitely recommend.",5,2023,12,05
211,"Lovely hotel, bad breakfast service ","Lovely hotel, very clean and comfortable beds but breakfast was a huge let down. Staff very unorganised, constantly running out of plates, bowls and orange juice for self service. Ordered tea when we where seated and it never arrived, checked with one of the waiters who told us the kitchen was busy and it was taking longer - didn’t think it should take that long to make a pot of tea! They really could have done with a manger overseeing the waiting staff during breakfast. ",4,2023,12,04
211,Convenient Location & Spacious Rooms,The hotel was conveniently located to the airport and the rooms were quite spacious. The breakfast buffet was very nice welcome instead of table service.  The hotel is very lively & festive upon arrival.  I also appreciated the secured garage parking which was very nice in the early morning hours sheltering you a bit from the cold weather.  ,4,2023,12,03
211,Ok not Great,"Location to 3arena not Great as presumed. Taxi about €12-15. Saturday night Very difficult to get, book a taxi if you can.
Restaurant food poor enough, Very expensive. Bar is ok drink is ok, bar food a bit tasteless and expensive for what your getting. Triple rooms are narrow. Only 2 cup's & facilities available in a room for 3. Not enough & reception had to drop up more, which took 20-25mins.
Rooms seem quiet for sleep, clean, shower not great. Turn air con in room to cold when using shower, prevents steam in bathroom.Fridge in room Very handy. 
Breakfast quite cold at 9.35am, different plates/cups needed to hold the heat longer, scrambled eggs etc Go cold fast.
Stay is ok a bit more reasonable than other hotel's including using taxis, Saturday night in Dublin...... expensive ",3,2023,11,27
211,"Comfortable and modern, would recommend!","The hotel was lovely throughout, modern and clean with lots of space. We had the standard room but it was a great size and the bed was so comfortable! Bruna at the check in desk was really helpful, particularly in organising the bottle of lovely prosecco to the room - it tasted fantastic, the glasses were spotless and the prosecco itself was nice and cold. The breakfast spread was brilliant, including hash browns and fresh orange juice that wasn't from concentrate, both of which I really appreciated. We thoroughly enjoyed our overnight and I would visit again for sure!",5,2023,11,20
211,Best hotel ever for the price!!,Lovely hotel with a great free Irish breakfast buffet. Very clean rooms and wonderful staff. Best hotel for the price I have ever stayed in!!  The maid service was outstanding and the front desk was so accommodating!! I recommend it highly!!,5,2023,11,15
211,Very enjoyable experience,"I stayed in The Creole Park Hotel for one night. It is easily accessible to Dublin airport and parking was included in the rate. 
The checkin staff were friendly and helpful. 
We had a meal in the sideline restaurant which was delicious and good value for money 
The room and bathroom were spotlessly clean and comfortable. 
The breakfast next morning was delicious and again the staff were professional and helpful 

Overall a very enjoyable experience I will be returning and I have no hesitation in recommending The Croke Park Hotel",5,2023,11,14

211,Fantastic stay at Croke Park Hotel ,"We were a group of 3 female travelers and had a lovely stay at the Croke Park Hotel. We felt very safe both in and outside of the hotel, which is located just across the street from the Croke Park Stadium. The location of the hotel was about 25 - 30 minutes walking from the center of the city with lots of beautiful shopping centers even closer. I want to particularly thank Stephen Barry at the front desk who checked us in and gave us a wonderful welcome indicative of what the remainder of our stay would be like. I also want to express our gratitude to the staff at The Sideline, the onsite restaurant, for fantastic food, drinks and service. Michael, Alex, Jorge, Diego and Nora took extra good care of care of our friend Colleen, who raved about how attentive everyone was to her. On our last evening there we wanted to order pizza well after the restaurant was closed (but the bar was still open) so we found a pizza place who delivered to the hotel lobby and the above named restaurant staff graciously continued to bring out drinks to us in the lobby. Their kindness enabled us to make the most of our last evening in Ireland and for that we are so grateful! ",5,2023,11,05

Lovely friendly staff on reception, in the bar and at breakfast.

Very impressed and great value for money.",5,2023,11,03
211,Outstanding Service and attention to detail,"This is a 4 star hotel that is offering the same service we have found in many 5 star hotels. From the moment we checked-in to our family room (No.413) to the minute we checked-out we were treated like royalty. 
We booked The Croke Park Hotel due to its location and price, we booked directly in a family room for 2 adults and 2 kids. The price we got for booking direct with the hotel was far better than any other price we saw online so well worth going direct.
The room and entire hotel was spotlessly clean, our family room was quite large and well equipped with a large tv, Chromecast tea/coffee station and Nespresso machine. 
We had free parking in the basement, Check-in was a breeze and we were accommodated much earlier than the official check-in time.
A taxi to the City Centre (O’Connell Street Spire) was only €10.20 which saved us walking with the 2 kids as we had a lot planned for the day.
The restaurant/Bar in the evening was lovely, nice atmosphere, plenty of polite staff and nothing was a problem to ask for. We had breakfast included the next morning which was excellent with plenty of options to suit even our fussy eater.
For any future family trips to Dublin The Croke Park Hotel will be our first choice.

The room was big and spacious with a comfortable queen bed, soda, chair, soda, mini fridge, working desk, plenty of storage, shower and bath.

The breakfast has plenty to choose from and if you want something extra, the kitchen can accommodate your request.

The hotel is just 20 minutes away from the city centre, but buses to the city centre are minutes away.

The staff were brilliant and very helpful.

Highly recommended.",5,2023,10,31

211,Highly recommended for a comfortable and luxurious stay,"Large and comfortable room, with a separate bath and shower in the bathroom. Very good breakfast, including ample vegetarian options.

A stones throw from Croke park football stadium.The room was well appointed, the bed was very comfortable.  Large comfy pillows. We arrived early before our 3pm check in but were able to be assigned a room. Even better we were given an upgrade and access to the executive lounge. Staff was  attentive and always helpful. We also enjoyed the food and bar. We opted for the breakfast package which is recommended. Overall a wonderful stay here.",5,2023,10,19
211,Fantastic customer service ,"Alex from the front lobby bar in the hotel presented us with outstanding customer service and satisfaction. From the time he met us to the time we left he attended to us with manners , humour, extremely professional and was full of knowledge about the establishment. He was so kind and made myself and my partner feel so so relaxed and comfortable with his beautiful presence and smile . Anything we asked for this guy accommodated with such resurgence and manners 👏🏻

This guy is just such an asset to the hotel and we do hope he is acknowledged for his professionalism. Alex thank you so so much for your service and your smile . Look forward to seeing you again hopefully before Christmas for a 🍻

211,Honest review,"Stayed for one night on a medical trip to Dublin. Rooms are immaculate and the hotel decor in the bar and lounge is lovely. Had dinner in the sideline restaurant. 2/3 mains were cold but they took so long to come in the first place we just got on with it. We sent the sides back and they took ages to replace and were cold again. The only member of staff that genuinely cared (we forgot to get her name) and looked after us in the end, we really appreciated. For management information she was a local girl from Drumcondra with dark hair and is an asset to your hotel. The breakfast was a shambles, items run out at the buffet and are not replaced. We were there well before finish time. The coffee and toast that are served to you are cold. Poached eggs come out overcooked and swimming in a bowl of water. At least plate them up on a hot plate. Reception staff were lovely and most helpful. Basic things like hot food, faster service and replenishment, this hotel would have gotten a 5 star review from us. Nail the basics, you have the rest.",3,2023,10,18
211,Ok for the night,"Stayed here for one night after arriving in Dublin, room was large and comfortable but dated.  Restaurant and lounge seemed to have a fun vibe although we didn't have a chance to eat or hang out there.",3,2023,10,17
211,Nice but overpriced,"Nice although overpriced. 

Some nice features however for $444 euros per night it is well overpriced. The safe did not work; the step in garbage did not work. Parking was extra and breakfast was extra.

Most staff were helpful. The lobby was very nice and inviting.  The rooms were okay; they felt crowded. The beds were very nice.",3,2023,09,24
211,Caters very well for family functions ,"Caters very well for family functions. Validated parking available. Lovely decor. Comfortable. Friendly, attentive and competent staff. We had buffet style catering in our function room, food was great. Facilities great. Would definitely recommend. ",5,2023,09,23
211,Nice stay at Croke Park,"We had a nice overnight stay at the Croke Park Hotel.  Booked at last minute after our flight was canceled. The room was well laid out and comfortable.  Staff were friendly and efficient.  Easy parking a bonus.  We liked the neighborhood, it was nice to be away from the all the craziness of central Dublin but still lots of great restaurants and things to do within walking distance. Overall a very comfortable and nice stay, though a bit on the basic side for costs..",4,2023,09,18
211,Lovely short visit in a comfortable and welcoming setting,"Friendly and helpful staff, clean and comfortable room with large, luxurious bed and smart bathroom containing a good supply of 'The White Company' products! Breakfast was plentiful and varied, and I had a delicious dinner in The Hawthorn restaurant. The hotel is, of course, perfectly situated for visiting the Croke Park stadium (of which I would recommend the tour), but is also fine for the city centre if you don't mind a 20-25 minute walk. I was also pleasantly surprised to be offered a free dental kit when I ran out toothpaste, saving me a late trip to a corner shop! Thank you for a short but lovely stay; I would like to return for a match experience...",5,2023,09,08
211,Catering Manager particularly needs to get a grip with this place,"An absolute shambles!
Booked in for dinner only to find the table was low level one in the bar area which was extremely noisily.  There clearly was not enough staff as we had to wait some time for drinks order to be taken and then the food one.  I ordered cod and chips.  When it arrived the chips were cold.  Having eventually managed to attract the attention of a member of staff they said they would replace the chips.  I asked for the whole plate to be taken back to the kitchen so I would eventually have a hot meal.  N such luck!  When the plate returned, yes the chips were warm but the fish and pea puree were both cold.  The meal was eventually returned to the kitchen with a begrudging apology.  By the time a replacement arrived the rest of my group had all finished their meals.  No offer was made to compensate for this situation.
Turning to breakfast the next day.  Staff did their best to avoid eye contact with the clientele to meet requests for tea/coffee etc.   In fact they were standing around, on one occasion in  a group of four, laughing with one on her mobile phone.
We chose this hotel as it was near the ferry port as we had an early start (before breakfast).  We were offered , and took, a take-out although there were not enough lids for the coffee/teas.  We asked for a number of the meals to be vegetarian.  The filling of avocado, peppers etc  were inedible and they went straight into the bin.
Management - get a grip",2,2023,09,07
211,Definitely highly recommend this hotel staff were amazing from check in to restaurant staff to room service staff excell,From booking online to checkout was flawless so easy I was in dublin at 4 am dropping off at airport I said I'd chance my arm at checking in at 8 am absolutely no problem even though normal check in is from 3 pm si thank you so much room spotless beds so comfortable 10 out of 10 excellent hitel highly recommended ,5,2023,08,22
211,Great stay and meal at The Croke Park,"What a wonderful Hotel. The staff is most gracious and accommodating. The front desk checked us in quickly and efficiently. 
The restaurant cocktails and food was served quickly and warm and was delicious. The atmosphere busy but quiet and most enjoyable. 
Our service from host and server was wonderful. Do not hesitate to stop by for a delicious cocktail or meal I am sure you will not be disappointed. We will definitely return.  ",5,2023,08,21
211,A very enjoyable end to our trip to Ireland.  Saved the best for last?,"Staff were excellent.  They assisted us with doing some last minute printing we needed.  They printed out and marked up maps for the area.  The restaurant staff were cheerful and welcoming.  The restaurant was spacious and quiet, though busy.

Our room was the largest we've had anywhere in Europe and the bathroom was huge with a tub and a shower.  It was a real luxury after some vary cramped and noisy hotels throughout Ireland.  The bed was comfortable and  the room was quiet.  Because it was next to the Croke Park Stadium, we were worried that it would be noisy, but it was perfect.  We took advantage of the location to go to the national botanical garden which was nearby. 

If we return to Dublin, we will definitely stay here.",5,2023,08,21
211,Good location with parking,"Lovely hotel, 20 min walk into town. Using the loyalty package,  we got free parking and breakfast.  Breakfast was very good with a good Irish buffet.
Room large enough for three of us (2 adults and a teenager. We were only here 1 night but would stay again.",4,2023,08,15
211,I was there for both All Ireland Finals,"Great welcome, service and vibe as well as lovely food and quality pints of Guinness! The Manager Sean Reid was outstanding. And all the support staff were friendly and very helpful. I would highly recommend the hotel and its location near the airport.",5,2023,08,14
211,First time in and it is my favourite now!,"Reception was great. Location is great, it was only few minutes walking from everywhere we were going to. The car park is good, but there's a 24H fee for it. Good wi-fi and good TV, I was able to cast from my tablet to it. 
Spacious room and clean. Everything was working in it.
Not expensive comparing to other hotels.
",5,2023,08,09
211,Excellent stay,"Loved my stay at Croke Park Hotel.  Very spacious room, with a great shower.  Lovely choice at breakfast.  Major compliments to the staff who are excellent, and go above and beyond for the customer.  Very welcoming reception area, with plenty of space to sit and chat.",5,2023,08,08
211,Awful Customer Realtions and not kid friendly,"Obviously major plus of the hotel is location for matches in Croke Park. Have stayed a number of times. 
Decided to take kids on this occasion. Not treated fairly to say the least. 
Had lunch here, attended match in Croke Park and had dinner booked for post match. 
After dinner the kids were excited to catch a glimpse of post match highlights in the bar but we were very rudely asked to retire to our room at 9:30 without even a prior warning. As soon as meal was paid for it was a case of we were then informed kids are no longer welcome as they were too young. (11 and 12) 
There was never a mention of this while we had our dinner but immediately once bill was settled it was a case of now you’re not welcome. 
While we pleaded for 5 minutes (all it took to watch highlights)the manager made quite the scene and ejected us from the bar area without even a moment to finish what we were drinking. 
When I questioned him he informed us the adults could return but kids needed to leave immediately. 
While I understand the law in Ireland with children in bars a few moments notice or finishing up time would have been courteous. 
There was zero issue while eating and were even offered if we wanted desert but  declined but as soon as we settled bill it was a case of kids definitely not welcome. 
The manager in this situation, while he has a job to do handled to situation in an appalling manner in front of two young kids. 
Big let down.  
Not at all a kid friendly hotel and couldn’t recommend a stay  if this is best the hotel had to offer when it  comes to guest relations.",1,2023,08,06
211,Lovely stay in a modern relaxing &nice staff hotel .,"The rooms were spotless,with great space including bathroom,there was a bath and a separate shower,also noticed a phone in bathroom in case of an emergency..the room was spacious with water ,tea coffee facilities in room and a fridge..The beds were very comfortable ,you couldn’t have a bad night sleep in these ..
We didn’t eat in restaurant but drinks were lovely and bar staff very nice ..the breakfast had everything you would want,definitely won’t leave here hungry with again lovely staff ..

Also they have ice machine on each floor and a tv lounge with tea coffee facilities..",5,2023,08,04
211,Good hotel,"Good hotel, clean nice rooms which is my most important thing. Really good food in the hotel restaurant! The only downside is the location from the town, I did not feel safe walking to the hotel at dark.",3,2023,08,01
211,"Wonderful Accommodations, Excellent Waitstaff, Delicious Food","The beds feel a bit like you’re climbing into a cloud, they are so comfortable and the room was very neat and clean. The hotel also offers these cute little alcoves to read by the fire or sit and chat. So cute and thoughtful! The crowning jewel though really is the staff at this hotel. They were so attentive and helpful. At dinner we had Milena and she was a delight! She offered us recommendations and anecdotes, thanks to her I chose the perfect after dinner dessert (the chocolate marshmallow bonbon was to die for)! The restaurant  itself was very chic and cozy, providing alternative seating options. I loved everything about my experience here! I can’t wait to visit again soon! ",5,2023,07,31
211,Perfect accomodation for family holidays and excellent location for seeing seaside as well as centre of Dublin,"Towels are fullest I have ever felt. Everything is nice and clean. Everybody is very professional. Coffe and tea supplies are great. Location is great, easy to go the seaside ( Howth, Bray Daly from Connoly tram station (DART). Dublin is great: nature and history/culture. ",5,2023,07,31
211,Wonderful ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️,Incredible hotel. Wonderful customer service and attention to detail. Rooms were immaculate. Food was wonderful and great breakfast selection.

211,Fantastic Stay,Fantastic place to stay and very nice staff.  Alex was a standout and looked after anything I needed during my stay went above and beyond what was required and never any issues that she couldn't solve was the most professional and kindest member of the staff during my stay. Would definitely stay again,5,2023,07,30

211,Helpful and brilliant staff,"Brilliant staff, go out off their way to help you. Due to my mother having a long stay in hospital in ICU, every member of staff couldn't have been more helpful. Reception staff, special thank you to a lovely girl Ana Luisa in the restaurant, Rebecca also for her understanding and communication over the phone. Staff went beyond to help my family under the circumstances. ",5,2023,07,26
211,Setting the bar for Dublin Hotels,We visited recently for a family celebration. The staff were very welcoming. Seán the manager was brilliant. Nothing was too much bother. Rooms were spotless and spacious. Food was top class and service excellent. Will definitely be back,5,2023,07,26
211,Croke Park Hotel Top Class,"I have to say a fabulous hotel, well ran, spotless, Beds so comfortable, great view to Croke park, Food was top class, the staff where do I start from front desk to restaurant, Bar, Security, everyone single one of the staff were helpful, polite, loved there jobs, happy which is lovely to see.  Looking forward to going back. ",5,2023,07,18
211,Dublin stay,"So I booked this hotel for a family of four 2 adults 2 children 12/15 years old. The hotel is a bit out the way , it costs around 10/15 euros to get to centre by taxi or 30 minute walk . The room cost just under £300 but you do get exceptional value and service. So the room was clean and tidy , hot water comfy beds a little dated will need to be updated soon. Included was 3 course meal for all of us and breakfast . The 3 course meal was wonderful , tasty and kids and adults really enjoyed this. The service was super Olivia was attentive kids loved her. Only criticism was the starter - ceaser salad was too big and the main course too big . The breakfast again choice super and service , everything you could think of- fresh juice , coffee, hot / cold food , fruit , all included .  We also was given a choice of a free activity to do - we choose the stadium tour which is across the road from the hotel. If you want a comfy stay , good food , happy staff that appreciate you this is the hotel for you . If you want a centre location and modern then this may disappoint but you cannot argue with the food, or the friendly staff thank you for a great stay ",5,2023,07,18
211,Disappointed,We booked hotel as it has a caroark but we're told on checkin that the car had to be moved at 12pm at the latest as hotel was fully booked the next night. The hotel should make this clear when taking your booking and not good enough at check in or with an A4 sheet on paper on the bed.,2,2023,07,17

The waiter Adrian is really professional and kind. Great experience. 
If I have the opportunity to come back I will do.
",5,2023,07,06
211,Nice place,"This was a really nice hotel for a family of four, around fifteen minutes on foot from the city centre. The personnel was polite, it had a nice restaurant, for those who want to have something to eat without getting out of the hotel and good breakfast.",4,2023,07,05
211,Good Experience,"We stayed here for one night to make an early morning meeting the following day. The check-in was smooth, we were told everything we needed on arrival. The room contained everything you would need for a comfortable stay. Lovely comfortable bed, tea/coffee making facilities, large TV, safe, iron etc. The bathroom was beautiful, very nice toiletries. We had a balcony room and that was great.
This wouldn't be our usual kind of place to stay as we like leisure facilities (sauna,pool,jacuzzi, spa treatments) and much larger rooms, but for business purposes or airport stays etc we would recommend here unreservedly. ",4,2023,07,04
211,Extremely Bad customer service !!!,"I dont normally write reviews . 
I stay in a lot of hotels around the country.
I never had an experience like this.
We always stay in 4 or 5 star . 
I stayed here with my son , my partner and his parents for his Dads birthday, for 1 night away as it was convenient to do the croke park tour.
On arrival we met with my partners parent s in the  bar.  We ordered some food and drinks.
All seemed ok. The staff were standing around waiting to pick up our glasses and plates before we finished eating. We were served by numerous staff members.
That night we arrived to the bar for drinks . We were given a table it didnt comfortably fit our group .
Another waitress asked, would we like to move to a bigger area with a couch.
It wasperfect . 
We stayed for a few hours had cocktails and drinks as we were celebrating 2 birthdays in the group. 
Next morning ,We arrived for breakfast. Checking in on arrival. We were asked room number and had we paid for breakfast !!  
We replied yes as my partner had paid on check in for both parties. 
We were seated for breakfast .
The breakfast wasn't great . We seemed to waiting for ages for food to be replenished. 
My partners parents came down to join us .
We were seated near each other. 
As we were sitting eating breakfast, another girl approached our table and asked our room number. We gave our room number, with that she replied have you paid for your breakfast.  I could not believe it . 
I was that annoyed, I left my seat and went straight to reception and reported it. The receptionist apologised. She then picked up the phone to call the breakfast room. No apology on my way back in or the way out . No apology to my partner or partners parents on checking out .
It looked like there was a lot of staff on with nothing to do.",2,2023,07,04
211,Great overall experience.,We were treated wonderfully. The beds were really confortable abd the room was very well prepared and servised. We also enjoyed the food we ate there and we were treated really well. We especially enjoyed the excellent service by Mirena. ,5,2023,06,25
211,10/10,"I cannot say a bad word about this place, from the moment we walked in we were greeted with nothing but smiles and friendship from the staff. Henrique & Olivia stood out big time, they were so friendly and it’s a credit to the venue for having these 2 members of staff. Thanks for looking after us so well 

Paul",5,2023,06,14
211,10/10 LOVE THIS HOTEL,"I came on business and had breakfast and happy hour at the hotel. Adrian was our bartender and was an absolute pleasure. So helpful, respectful and fun. Will be back again and stay at this incredible establishment. ",5,2023,06,11

Thank you for taking care fo us! 100 points and stars to this amazing hotel and great services and staff.. Thank you to the staff at the hotel… Cheers,5,2023,06,11
211,"Awful staff in this hotel,do not go here","This hotel is lovely from the rooms to the lobby, but as you start dealing staff members it is disgusting particulary when you are looking for a table for food, there is a girl with glasses who is vey rude should not be working in the hospitality industry , i was watching as she spoke to staff and i was appalled by her mannerism and behaviours i could see the floor and bar staff were going above and beyond for the guest but in her and a fellow senior member of staff mannerism towards there staff was disgrace they need to learn how to work with people. In other circumstances it was a good stay but the hotel need to fix there staff",1,2023,06,10
211,Nice stay,"Modern, spacious hotel outside of city center. Convenient for Croke Park Stadium/conference center events. About 20 min and 25-30 euro taxi to the airport. Bus (buy ticket card at Spar, or 1.70e per ride, no change) or taxi (Free Now app works well; no uber) can be taken to the center, otherwise 30 min walk. Room was comfortable for several days, good housekeeping. Breakfast was ok but got boring since always the same. Nice lobby with bar and restaurant but did not try food. There is a good Italian restaurant down the street and a really nice pub (Fagan's) about 10 min walk. ",5,2023,06,07
211,Just a perfect hotel experience,"Excellent hotel, warm efficient reception. The hotel has a lovely lobby which smells great. Spotless, spacious and fresh rooms with all the amenities logically presented: plug points, internet, all the information, good towels, great pillows. Just perfect! I would certainly recommend, and will try to find more in this hotel chain. Well done, it was a delightful experience to be there. ",5,2023,05,29
211,Satisfactory hotel with some pluses and minuses.,"The room was comfortable, the bath had both a tub and shower.  The shower worked well and there were no issues with water temp or pressure.  The bed was comfortable and there were a lot of outlets and places to charge devices.  There were mirrors within reach of using a blow dryer.  Washclothes are provided.  Hair dryer, iron, and pants press were also in the room as well as equipment to make instant coffee or tea.  Small refrigerator was also in the room.  We had some service problems at breakfast as there was a conference there and a high volume of diners.  Breakfast was a buffet and acceptable.",4,2023,05,27
211,A lovely hotel!,"This is a lovely hotel! We spent three very comfortable nights here. It’s just a 15 minute walk to downtown, so the location is great. The room was spacious, the bathroom was huge (a luxury in any European hotel ha). Breakfast is amazing but if they’re busy, service is pretty slow so get there early.",5,2023,05,22
211,What’s not to like?,"My favourite place to stay in Dublin. Good location, really friendly staff, great food, nice bar, the rooms are spacious and clean with super comfortable beds, free parking, I mean what’s not to like?

Will definitely return, if I’m ever heading to Dublin, The Croke Park is always my first choice for somewhere to stay.",5,2023,05,22
211,Ok,"My stay was nice , the service was good , but I'm afraid the food leaves alot to be desired  especially the breakfast. Cold plates , cold toast , cold cooked food ,and above all the quality of the breakfast was just not up to scratch. More like a budget hotel as far as breakfast was concerned. Very disappointed. 
",3,2023,05,18
211,A Truly Olympian Hotel,"I have been going to the Croke Park for longer than I care to remember.  In itself this shows how much I value this wonderful place.  The staff are extremely professional, yet they always have a way of making your feel at home.  Courteous, warm and ever friendly and helpful.  The rooms are large and luxurious.  The food is always to an excellent high standard.  In particular the Lamb Cottage Pie and the creamy yet light porridge in the morning.  Excellent croissants and freshly squeezed orange juice.  Generous amounts of coffee at breakfast and a traditional, hard to beat, full of variety cooked breakfast.  Ideally located for the city centre.  Standards always to the highest degree.  An olympian hotel that never rests on its laurels - Citius, Altius, Fortius - Communiter",5,2023,05,11
211,Amazing,"Spent two nights in Croke Park Hotel and there's really nothing that wasn't amazing during our stay. Good location right in front of the stadium, very welcoming hall. The rooms are clean and have any facility (TV screen, air conditioning, Wi-fi, Bathub etc)  and, most importantly, the breakfast has an incredible variety of choice and it's all delicious. All of this for an insanely low price. Recommended to everyone ",5,2023,05,07
211,Family friendly with central location,"We have stayed several times in The Croke Park Hotel as a family and have had a great stay on each occasion. The family rooms are spacious, clean and comfortable. The staff are very friendly and helpful. The location is second to none as it is so central to everything you want to visit in Dublin.",5,2023,05,06
211,Bliss,"Recently stayed in The Croke Park after returning to Dublin on a late flight and I smiled to myself when I got to my room - low lights on, bed turned down and cups and saucers out ready for cocoa. After a late flight this was so welcome rather than drive home (3 hours). The Croke never fails to deliver in terms of comfort and staff and without doubt has the comfiest hotel beds ever. After a great nights sleep, I enjoyed  breakfast before heading home refreshed. Thanks to all.",5,2023,05,06
211,Thoroughly enjoyable.,"We stayed here on March 10th as we were attending a GAA/AIB awards evening in Croke Park. It was thoroughly enjoyable and deserving of my 5 stars.
All staff were extremely helpful, room was spacious and quiet. Breakfast was perfect not just because they served porridge, my favourite! 
We enjoyed a lovely evening post award ceremony in the residents' bar with friends and found the bar to be most comfortable and spacious , accomodating our groups with ease. 
A great place to stay if attending any event in Croke Park with plentiful onsite parking  adding to the convienence.  Highly recommend!! ",5,2023,05,03
211,Delicious dinner at Croke Park,"This is our first stay in Dublín and the Croke Park Hotel was such good choice!!
We have dinner at the restaurant and we had an excellebt service by Milena and Adrian, very nice and great advices 
Chicken, salmon and apple crumb are delicious 
Thank you for such great evening",5,2023,04,30
211,Good service in the restaurant,The service of Adrian and Milena from the resraurant it was excellent. We asked to change table because it was very noisy and they did. They recommend us very good meals and they were very friendly with us.,4,2023,04,30
211,Great Hotel,"Really nice and comfy beds. We loved the breakfast, the selection was fantastic und the Service was excellent, especially Sandeep. Could be a little bit cleaner in our room, but all in all we would totally recommend this hotel.",4,2023,04,30
211,Henrique in the restaurant - a true star!,"Bedrooms - very dated but comfortable beds, good nights sleep!
Restaurant - Beautiful setting and Henrique was the best server ever - give that man a raise! Lovely warm and bubbly, the entire family loved him! True Irish/Brazilian hospitality ;)",4,2023,04,29
211,Brilliant experience that we hope to have once again in the next few months!,"Great spot as usual, really pulled out the stops to make our stay comfortable, food super and as always Seán and all the staff were so professional! 

All our requests, handled with ease and a smile! ",4,2023,04,28
211,"Good, let down by the parking situation","Stayed in the hotel around 10 years ago and decided to return. Still a nice hotel in a decent location with friendly staff, so would recommend on that basis. The only reason I’ve given 4 stars rather than 5 is because we were charged for parking when we left. Part of the reason we booked was the “complementary car parking” which is referred to on the hotel’s TripAdvisor summary. This is misleading, as it’s only complementary when you book with the hotel direct and the widely used third party website didn’t indicate otherwise. I even mentioned getting the parking validated at check-in and wasn’t corrected then when I should have been. Not the end of the world, but the hotel needs to be clearer with guests on this.",4,2023,04,27
211,Exceptional care,I arrived past midnight - as I had taken ill earlier and required a hospital visit - the receptionist offered to bring me tea and toast to my room. She was exceptionally kind and truly professional. The night manager was so helpful also. I was really well looked after. I’ll be back!,5,2023,04,27
211,A nice place to stay in Dublin,"Quiet, clean, and friendly personal. They responded quickly when we needed something.
Easy access to the city center. You can either take several bus lines or walk there.
I would recommend having several USB sockets in each room as it will be easier to charge electronics.",5,2023,04,20
211,"Comfortable hotel, but not welcoming and a fair distance from centre.","Upon our arrival, the reception staff insisted that we only had one room booked, when we'd booked two, which was quite embarrassing in front of others!! However they eventually located our other room, but only because I'd taken a screenshot of 2 rooms at the time of booking online, so I'd recommend doing the same, but no apologies or anything were given.
 Also we were one family and asked, at booking, for rooms to be located next to each other, but didn't get that, which was awkward.
We had booked directly and had a lot of trouble accessing our online account, which said we had no rooms booked at all at one point, emails weren't responded to, so I'm glad we took the screenshot, or we'd have been left one room short!!
We had to leave at 4am due to our return  flight time, the reception chap wasn't friendly or helpful and didn't even tell us that the garage door would be locked at that time, nor gave instructions regarding how we were to get out. This cost us quite a while contacting him, which had a knock on effect of us getting to the airport on time.
Staff were all ok, I wouldn't say friendly, but were polite enough, the cleaning staff were the most friendly there.
We weren't given anything extra, such as chocolates for the kids, or bottles of water upon leaving, like other people mentioned in their reviews, but we got what we paid for, a comfortable stay.
The hotel itself was lovely inside, aswell as nice and secure.  Rooms were comfortable and spacious with good showers and nice toiletries. Breakfast was good, but be aware if you go 40 mins before the end, like we did, they don't replenish things. A lot of our party are vegetarian and the granola pots weren't replenished, croissants etc same, so not everyone got what they wanted. Even toast, which had to be ordered, was only one half slice per person!! Also if you're a bigger family you get split between two different tables, they wouldn't put one together for us!!
The hotel is quite far out from the city centre attractions. Uber taxis were around 18 Euros one way, so factor that in if you plan to go into the centre much, as maps showed a 35 min walk and there's a lot of walking around in the centre to visit things.
Overall I'd sum up saying it's a nice looking hotel, very comfortable, good breakfasts if you get there early and don't want toast, but not really a friendly feeling from reception, or breakfast staff and not very welcoming if there's more than 4 in your party.",4,2023,04,14
211,Fabulous Easter break,"We are just back from a fabulous Easter break with my husband and 3 kids. we had such a lovely stay from beginning to end .

We had lovely food, cozy atmosphere and an unforgettable experience.it has everything you need .  the rooms are spacious and very clean, The kids loved it here and were so grateful for the beautiful butler chocolates they were given on arrival for Easter it was such a lovely touch. we will definitely be back again. Thank you to everyone for making our break so enjoyable. ",5,2023,04,12
211,Amazing Hotel with Exceptional Staff.,"Exceptional staff! Every single person we spoke to made us feel welcome and special.

Breakfast was up there with the best we've had! High qualiry ingredients,great choice and again. Such friendly helpful staff.

O Connell street, main shops, temple bar etc just a 10-15 easy stroll away! 

We can't wait to return.",5,2023,04,07
211,We loved this hotel ❤️,We really enjoyed our stay at the Croke Park hotel. The hotel is very comfortable and has a lovely environment. The staff were so friendly and helpful.

We have stayed at a Doyal Collection hotel in Washington DC  before and really liked that too. ,5,2023,04,06
211,Exceptional Easter Break,Attention to detail and customer care meant that our trip was just what we needed. Love this hotel and the food in Sidelines is exceptional - some of the best we have experienced. Staff in the bar went the extra mile to make our visits memorable. ,5,2023,04,06
211,Good atmosphere during matches,Very  busy during the gaa matches- if you are there for that then great! If you aren't there for the gaa matches you would be very confused and wouldn't get the most from the hotel. Couldn't comment on what it's like not during gaa matches,4,2023,04,04
211,"Good location, dreadful service/management ",The hotel was very busy due to football matches being played on the same weekend as our stay. First of all we couldn’t check in as the road was closed and they were not allowing access by footpath. Half of our party  managed to check in hours later than expected but could not access the car park. There was no apology or compensation offered for this and management did not hel at all. The next morning we came down for breakfast and had to queue 30 mins for a table. It was chaos. The breakfast buffet was at least 50% empty and was not replenished during the hour we were seated. No toast or basic breakfast items available. I asked staff 4 times for tea and coffee before we got it. I would have expected a lot more from a Doyle collection hotel.,2,2023,04,03
211,Mayo,"Excellent stay once again ,warm welcome, efficient  receptionist , Irish  hospitality at its best  at The Croke Park Hotel.
Busy weekend at the hotel with GAA games across the road but still manged to smile.

211,Best hotel,This lovely hotel had everything I was expecting  wonderfull staff brilliant decor  and a breakfast to die for.  Everything was local to walk and the bar  was well price would definitely  stay again job well done thanks for enjoyable  stay,5,2023,03,30
211,great place to stay,"Friendly staff in a welcoming setting. Hotel is more up market (i.e. a bit expensive) but there is value for the money, with lots of good service and food. Very clean, nice products in the room, overall a very good experience.",5,2023,03,25
211,Bathroom totally inaccessible.,"I had asked for an accessible room but it was not accessible - it didn't have bars around the toilet or a walk in shower.  I was told later that it was 'semi accessible' (it had a bar on the wall beside the bath) so be careful when booking to ask for a fully accessible room, if required. The bathroom and bedroom were spotless except for a disgusting throw at the bottom of the bed which needs to be binned. The mattress dipped in the middle. ",2,2023,03,24
211,Good all round,"We visited here and stayed for the final weekend of the six nations championship. The staff were friendly and helpful and rooms are attractive, well furnished and with good bathrooms. Common areas are modern and attractive and all services provided.",4,2023,03,22
211,Great place,Nice clean hotel with good breakfast. Rooms are spacious and look beautiful. There is a gym guests can use. Staff was polite and made us feel good. It's very possible to walk to city centre and we did just that. There probably is a public transport connection too.,5,2023,03,19
211,A great Irish experience,"Had a really great experience at the desk with Bruna. She was very personable, friendly,quick to attend to my needs and very informative. The whole hotel is beautiful. Love the shower and bath combo. The breakfast was fabulous. Love a real Irish breakfast. Baked beans, mushrooms, hash browns, and the best porridge. Can’t recommend this hotel more!!",5,2023,03,18
211,We'll be back,"9 years after Our last Visit, we rerurned to Croke Park Hotel and it's a return to Old friends. From the first Minute of Our stay there was a very good feeling caused by professinality and hospitality. We'll be back by Our next visit to Ireland.",5,2023,03,15
211,Oldie but excellent hotel,The Croke Park hotel is not a brand spanking new hotel but it still delivers.  If you're looking for hip hotel  go elsewhere but if you're looking for a relaxing hotel and a good night's sleep The Croke Park is the place to stay.  Spacious lobby and bar area with plenty of seating as to not feel crowded and too noisy.  Great breakfast selection.  ,5,2023,03,15

211,Loved the staff,"Visited the hotel for a  family gathering which was held in the Hawthorn. The staff who were taking care of us were  Keera, Adrian and Kaylie and they were just amazing. They assisted us with everything and were there to help us with whatever we needed. Loved Their personality and also their friendly approach to the kids. It's the service they gave that was something that made all the difference.. a huge thank you to the entire team.",5,2023,03,12

211,Weekend break,"We were visiting for a family birthday. The location was perfect for us, the service was excellent as was the breakfast. The traffic noise in our room was a little noisy but the room was very comfortable and spacious.",5,2023,03,08
211,City Break in Dublin - Great Hotel,"The hotel was great, really nicely decorated. Staff were friendly and an upgraded room for my partners birthday was very kind! Breakfast was very tasty (but a little on the pricey side). Room itself was cheap though - would say the walk to city centre is around 30/35 mins but so long as you are ok with walking you will be fine!",5,2023,03,05
211,Good service and a warm welcome,"We stayed in The Croke Park Hotel for a second time in six months. Once again, Tomas, the manager on duty and his staff made us most welcome. Our Saturday night stay coincided with the GAA annual congress. I was pleasantly surprised to see that the hotel showed no signs of strain on what must have been one of the busiest weekends of the year. The food was tasty, all staff were professional and welcoming. Our well-appointed room was spotless. 

One matter requiring attention- the electronic room keys don’t always work (we had a similar experience on our previous visit) necessitating repeated visits to reception to have the key recoded.",4,2023,02,26
211,Excellent,Highly recommend this hotel well suited in the heart of Dublin easy access to all the main shopping areas . The staff very professional and extremely friendly  very welcoming and had a positive smile .. ,5,2023,02,26
211,Wonderful staff!,"The Croke Park Hotel is a great option for visitors to Dublin (particularly in the off-peak season as it is always very busy during the summer season due its proximity to the national stadium).

The Sideline Bar is a stylish spot for a quiet drink and the hotel has wonderful staff in all departments.",5,2023,02,24
211,Outstanding Customer Service,"I just want to drop a quick note to say what a wonderful staff member you have in Rebecca Hughes. 

I booked a room with you guys today over the phone. Rebecca took my call and could not have been more helpful. I am travelling with my father who is in a wheelchair. 

Rebecca was so kind to me from the outset. She understood the challenges that someone in a wheelchair may have and did her utmost to ensure that our stay with you in March would be as seamless as possible. We discussed the most appropriate options available to  us for our stay on our initial call. Rebecca then unexpectedly called me back to discuss a better option that she had found for us. I really felt she went above and beyond for me today. 

When I told my Dad I had found a room in the Croke Park, he was very excited. He told me he had always wanted to stay there sometime but had never got around to it. I hadn't known, so its been a bit of a winner of a day :)

Looking forward to our stay in March. 

And thanks again Rebecca, you are an absolute star!!

",5,2023,02,20
211,Nice modern hotel,"This nice hotel is rather well located, not far from down-town (more or less half-an-hour by walking) and 7-10 minutes walk from a bus-stop (AirCoach 700) to and from the airport, which makes it really very convenient. Full English breakfast served every morning (self-service except for toasts and coffee, that have to be ordered), a bit crowd on Saturday (even if they open at that occasion both dining rooms). Very friendly staff, both at the reception desk and at the restaurant (some of them, being for countries like Spain or Argentina) speak Spanish. All in all, a rather good option for families to stay in Dublin at a reasonable price.",4,2023,02,18
211,"Gorgeous hotel, spotless clean","Beautifully decorated, very spacious areas, big rooms. Cleanliness can't be flawed. Friendly staff. Parking 15 euro per night is a bit steep. No swimming pool or games room or anything for children.  Otherwise brilliant hotel.",5,2023,02,16
211,The bed hotel so far in my opinion Notting but excellent,"I will recommend it to anyone because the hotel is excellent, easy to reach and close to the city centre for any amenities. The hotel is very clean and there food and staffs are excellent, wonderful individuals.",5,2023,02,15
211,Great option!,"Had a great stay.  I went for business and everything worked out perfectly.  Liked the style, super clean, comfortable bed, good Wi-Fi.  just across from stadium door, a m a z i n g location, couldn't be better.  Considering Dubling hotels are super expensive, this offered -good- value.",5,2023,02,07
211,A Weekend at the Croke Park Hotel,"This was a family visit to Dublin for a GAA event in the Croke Park stadium. We were joining by friends and GAA club members. It was a memorable experience for one and all, enhanced by the experience of the Croke Park hotel ",4,2023,02,05
211,Amazing evening with friends,"Adore the Croke Park. Service is always so friendly and warm. Rooms are absolutely spotless. Drinks and food were so good, the bar manager went out of his way to make non alcoholic cocktails for our designated driver. Can't wait for the next stay!",5,2023,02,05
211,"Excellent hotel - we had a two-day meeting, and everything was great","Staff were very helpful, the hotel is lovely and the meeting facilities were perfect. We had two lunches there too as a group of 16 people, and everyone was very happy. The meeting rooms were big and spacious, with natural light and reasonably priced. Thank you!",5,2023,01,25
211,Lovely Hotel,Excellent hotel and value for money with a really big family room which was needed.  There was also a great size ensuite and a bath which nowadys is hard to find in some hotels.Attended a match in Croke Park and was a great buzz and atmosphere around.,5,2023,01,24
211,Excellent Stay at The Croke Park Hotel,"Management and staff were welcoming and sincere about wanting to ensure we had a positive experience at the hotel.  Highly recommend staying at the hotel, whether it be for games in Croke Park or even visits to Dublin.  Convenient proximity to Dublin Airport (15-20 minutes drive).",5,2023,01,23
211,"Midweek Break,Excellent Hotel.","Stopped at this hotel for a couple of nights midweek. It is handy for the City Centre, and is based next to the canal. The room I had was very comfortable and clean. The staff are absolutely brilliant and very helpful. Breakfast is a typical English, but other products are available, with unlimited toast, tea and coffee, you can’t go wrong. I will definitely be using this establishment again, when I visit Dublin.",5,2023,01,20
211,Poor dining experience ruined the last leg of our honeymoon trip across the country,"Had booked this as part of the last leg of our honeymoon trip around Ireland with my wife and son.

Was told that dining was quiet today and to call down when ready to be seated. Landed at 6pm and it was quiet. My wife and I ordered 2 steaks and a baby bowl of mash, veg and gravy for our 11 month old son.

After 20 minutes our steaks landed. Lady said your baby bowl is coming now. After looking round the room we could see others being seated and getting their food in the same time. But still no baby bowl.

Spoke to a member of staff who said they would look into this. My wife and I proceeded to eat our dinners and again more people got seated and food inside 20 minutes but no bowl for my son.

After again asking staff what was going on, an hour later the bowl arrived. The manager gave the pathetic excuse that the first one the chef made had soup not gravy. However the mash, gravy and veg was in 3 separate bowls.

Sorry but I’ve worked in kitchens before and I know that gravy, soup and mash is made in large batches. With the one my son did receive being in 3 separate bowls it leads me to believe the chef was more interested in making his fancy burgers than waste his time on making a simple mash and gravy for a child.

Ruined the experience for me. Only reason I gave a 3 star review for dining was the bar staff were nice to talk to. The manager did not make eye contact with me the rest of the evening and anytime I approached the bar for a drink, they quickly went the opposite direction.",3,2023,01,18
211,another excellent stay,"executive room, executive service. staff were cheery and attentive. They made us feel spoiled.

good distance to walk into Dublin centre or Drumcondra and close enough to airport to be convenient.
Thank you",5,2023,01,15
211,Outstanding stay,"From my first phone call to the hotel where I was assisted by the friendly and helpful manager Sean with making arrangements for a large family room - my impression of the level of service was excellent.  Our stay then far exceeded expectations.  All staff in every area from housekeeping to dining and reception were outstanding.  The breakfast was delicious - lots of choices and hot/fresh food.  Ambience throughout the hotel was wonderful - warm, comfortable, lots of nicely lit and cosy seating areas to hang out and have drinks/food.  Beds were super comfortable, bathroom was huge - great shower, big bath and White Company toiletries were a treat.  It was my husband's 50th and everyone went out of their way to make him feel special.  Our children - who are both autistic and sensitive to noise/crowds/bright lighting - found the hotel calming, welcoming, spacious and very relaxing.  They really enjoyed themselves.  Our sincere thanks for such a memorable stay. Highly recommend a stay.  We cannot wait to come back and see you again.",5,2023,01,09
211,Excellent location service poor.,"I stayed here with family on Saturday last. The hotel was very busy due to big football match the next day. Check in was efficient and room was adequate if a little small. The public areas in the hotel are nice and comfortable. The bar on the Saturday evening was very busy but the service was very poor. It took 20 minutes to get served at the bar. The next morning came down for breakfast and had to queue for table. We were then sat at a table that was full of dirty dishes, cups and cutlery. It took some 30 minutes for someone to completely clear this and bring us fresh cutlery. It was chaos. There seemed to be a lack of trained staff. I would have expected a lot more from a Doyle collection hotel and for the money spent while at this hotel.",2,2023,01,09
211,A wonderful restful stay,A warm welcome from friendly professional staff in a very comfortable hotel. Good hot breakfast. Excellent service. A nice easy 30mins stroll into the centre of town. We really enjoyed our first weekend in Dublin. Can't wait to go back. ,4,2023,01,09
211,Worst Hotel Ever,"Went for a family night away and was met with the most rude and obnoxious bar staff and management ever experienced. Verbally and physically abused by staff. No leadership, management or common sense shown, avoid at all cost please",1,2023,01,08
211,Perfect but a bit far from the city centre,"All the facilities in both the room and the hotel itself: cleanliness, kindness, traditional but modern aspect, massive TV and a really comfy bed. The air conditioning was OK although a little bit noisy. 
I can't rate the experience as perfect because it was a bit far from the city centre (O'Connel Street, Grafton Street, Temple Bar...) and it's a kind of residential area with few bars, restaurants or supermarkets, which in addition, poorly illuminated and really filthy streets.",4,2023,01,03
211,Fab stay,"Great spot near ferry. Beautiful hotel. Friendly staff. Mighty price. Lovely food in bar. Would stay again with out doubt.
Sadly didn’t get to try the breakfast as were off early to ferry. Lovely having separate shower and bath in room.
",5,2023,01,03
211,Regrets...,"We have been in the Croke Park Hotel for two nights (currently on our second) and there are two more to go... And we have mixed feelings. It's a very nice hotel, out of the way but only 15 minutes walk from the centre, and the public areas are superb, as is the breakfast which is delicious and of high quality and the staff are very attentive... But for the price of the room, many things are wrong: no fridge although it was indicated on the description of the room, the TV didn't work the first night (we said so and it works better than yesterday but it turns off without warning after 5, 10, 15 minutes, it depends), we didn't have hot water the first night (also repaired this evening...) but what is the most exhausting is the noise Last night we couldn't sleep until midnight because we could hear the neighbours as if they were in the room, and tonight children have been running and shouting in the corridors for almost 2 hours... We can say that it's not the fault of the hotel, but after a certain standard, it's really not normal to undergo that when we want to rest after a day of visit. Let's just hope that the next two nights will be better so that we don't end the year so badly...",4,2022,12,29
211,great over night stop,"This is always a relaxing hotel, with on-site parking and good amenities, the public areas a grand and inviting, the Bar/Restaurant is a rewarding experience with high quality service. The staff are friendly and attentive.",5,2022,12,28
211,Excellent facilities and a very good price,"We stayed for 4 nights and we enjoyed every moment of it.
Staying here was the ideal base for walking into the city centre 15 minute walk, plenty of food and drink options within the hotel itself.
The staff were absolutely brilliant. Very friendly , very helpful and made the check in and check out process very easy.
Would highly recommend staying here , the price of what you pay is worth it. We would have paid more for what we stayed in.
We will be going back in the future. ",5,2022,12,19
211,Lovely stay!,"Stayed at the croke park hotel when visiting family and doing some Christmas shopping. We found the location excellent and close proximity to the city center. The hotel is well decorated for Christmas and the kids loved the Christmas trees and playing with the presents under the trees! The room was modern, clean and comfortable. The breakfast was perfect also with pancakes and Nutella for the kids! Staff were very friendly and we would definitely recommend this hotel. ",5,2022,12,19
211,Family friendly,"Would book again and recommend. Very friendly, thoughtful and helpful staff. Good food. Free parking. Well appointed rooms. Lovely linen. Big chromecast TV in room. Nice little gifts for the children on arrival. ",5,2022,12,18
211,Beautiful Hotel with helpful staff,"Stayed one night in hotel. Well located, lots of parking, beautiful inside and very helpful staff, especially in the restaurant.  With a Coeliac in our group, we needed to be sure the food was 100% gluten free. The staff could not do enough, one lady in particular and got us a fab breakfast.",5,2022,12,17
211,"Super quick stay, pleased with our choice.","We stayed here for a very quick stay (5pm-8am) due to its location to our car rental return location. It is only a 1 minute walk from the Enterprise on the street. We were happy to relax in the hotel room and watch a world cup game. The room was nice with a large TV and a king-sized bed. The bathroom was nice and clean. I loved that I couldn't hear others walking the halls or in nearby rooms. Access to the lounge for bottled water and snacks was helpful. We had a quick meal at the Sideline of fish and chips, and it was good. We had a good sleep and it's only a 20 minute ride to the airport. We are pleased with our stay and have. I did give4 stars for cleanliness as our lounge chair had a stain on it, but otherwise it did feel clean. We did not use the other in-room amenities like the coffee machine, but it was nice to have it there.",5,2022,12,14
211,Lovely,"I popped into the restaurant for a quick bite to eat before a football match and it was great. Everything was lovely especially our waitress, Rachel! She was so helpful- great service from her! Will definitely be back!! ",5,2022,12,12
211,Excellent,A Warm welcome awaits you at the Croke Park Hotel. Located directly across from the entrance to Croke Park football stadium. Very happy with our room and services provided. Would recommend to anyone travelling to Dublin . Convenient for travelling from Dublin Airport and into city centre with public transport within walking distance. Nice restaurants nearby if you decide not to eat in the hotel. ,5,2022,12,11
211,First class customer service,After a bit of a hiccup with our booking . The Croke park team went over and above . Thomas the manager thank you for the meal and drinks vouchers and the chocolates . Very much appreciated. All the staff were lovely .,5,2022,12,05

211,Christmas Magic,A warm welcome from staff made for a great start to our trip. Friendly and efficient. Christmas decorations were delightful and the cocktails a dream. Parking a real bonus and location just a 30 min stroll into O'Connell Street,5,2022,12,03
211,Couples stayover,Very comfortable hotel rooms very clean and quiet. A nice breakfast also but staff were not able to keep up with the amount of people booked in. Bar service in the evening time was very poor and the residents bar was a disaster,3,2022,11,28
211,Modern and well located,Hotel was well placed for exploring Dublin and also had car parking.Reception friendly welcoming and well organised. Our room was of a good standard and clean.  Plenty of storage.Great breakfast with plenty of choice Enjoyed our stay and would come again.,4,2022,11,27
211,Value but needs to improve Bar,"Good Bits: Room nice and also clean, Breakfast very good, check in nice and easy, good value for Dublin.

Improve Bits: Bar staff behind bar need training in customer service, Gin and Tonic €10 served in a wine glass with just ICE, had to ask for lemon and this arrived about 5 mins later with not even a sorry, came back to Bar after function at 11.20, told last orders although there were plenty of people in bar, again served with not as much as a smile, was then moved to lobby if you wanted another drink, they take order in lobby and then go to bar where you are no longer allowed to sit. Crazy for a busy hotel on a Thursday evening.",3,2022,11,23
211,"Great, but attention to detail missing","Overall this is a great hotel, modern and centrally located. It has a great restaurant, ample parking and a delicious breakfast offering. Service from all on the front desk was great.

I couldn’t quite score full marks because of the following points which took away from the experience. 

1. Both days we arrived for breakfast and no one came to seat us at the podium on either occasion but then did ask for room number. It’s not clear - do we seat ourselves or wait? No signage. Also the people serving neglected one half of the seating area, had to get up after 10 minutes to ask for tea and toast. Others had same experience

2. Food in the restaurant was good although quite pricey which didn’t reflect the service that came with it. No one asked how our meals were despite us seated next to the bar on a non busy evening. 

3. Big huge bedspreads are a terrible eyesore on a bed particularly when there’s the odd stain. The towels were also not free of stains.",4,2022,11,23
211,Enjoyable experience,Enjoyable stay for  two nights .Hotel is in a great location within walking distance to city centre and all churches . Near the Mater Hospitals .Staff were very friendly and efficient .Car parking is free which is a big advantage in Dublin ,5,2022,11,21

Unbelievable, how comfortable you made me feel traveling from the United States in here to Ireland make me feel welcome warm I just can't say enough for Vladims. ",5,2022,11,20
211,Lovely Stay,I stayed in Croke Park Hotel on Fri 11th Nov.  I had dinner in the very busy bar and it was really tasty.  The service I received from Vadims M was second to none.  He could not do enough for me.  I had a great sleep in their very comfortable bed and breakfast was good the next morning too.  Well done to all.,4,2022,11,13
211,Vacation Dublin first time,"every thing was very good, friendly staff, helpful, made it a very pleasant hotel ecperience. Price for the quality of the hotel was ecellent, the food was great and the serive was fast. Treated me and my wife like part of their family.",5,2022,11,11
211,Friendly Staff,"Last weekend I and a couple of my friends arrived at the hotel bar. We had a few drinks and were well looked after by the team. Entering the bar makes one feel that one has plenty of space. The atmosphere of the bar was amazing, from my experience, the atmosphere cannot be purchased. It’s all down to the staff and how they treat guests. 
Special thanks to Vadims for great and efficient service.
Definitely will come there for a drink and will recommend it to others.
",5,2022,11,10
211,Night out,Hotel smells amazing as you walk in lovely rooms and bar and fabulous staff only downside it's it's a bit out of the way no shops near the hotel you practically have to walk to Dublin city for a shop as in if you want a newspaper or bottle of coke or something small ,5,2022,11,09
211,Used to be so much better,"It pains me to write this review as this was always one of my favourite hotels, however, this visit is far removed from the many good nights I've enjoyed here. It has been a few years sibnce I've been here and I wish I stayed elsewhere this weekend.
Although I arrived at the hotel 30 minutes after check in there appeared to be a problem allocatiing me a room. The girl at check in explained that my room wasn't ready and they would give nme a voucher for a drink while my room was prepared. To be honest I understand there things happen but I was taking my mum to a show and was concerned about time as we had pre theatre dinner reservations. Thankfully there was a gentleman on reception who was able to sort us out with a room,
We stayed on the 2nd floor and when we exited the elevator there was a fusty smell. There was also a lot of room service dishes to the right of our room. THis was at 3:30PM and were still there when we returned at 11PM that evening.
I booked this almost a year ago as art of my mums Christmas present. It was only after I booked that I discovered it was €10 for car parking if you didn't book direct with the hotel. I had never been charged before. With hindsight I shouod have went elsewhere.
When I paid for the parking at check in they charged €15. I was absolutely knocked out by this. Never have I witnessed such blatant profiteering by a hotel. It's a s if they wanted to queeze evert last cent out of you. This alone would be enough to make this a no go for me. 
Breakfast was another disaster. tea and toast arriving at the end of your breakfast. I appreciate they're busy and the staff work exteremly well, however, if you know in advance that you're going to be that busy, you should have enough staff to deal with this.
This is such a shame as I always loved staying here. I still get a buzz out of waking and looking out the bedroom window and seeing Croke Park in fromt of me. However, dinner plates and cutlery left all day outside our room and the complete rip-off parking charges has soured my opinion of this hotel. Maybe more time treating customers well rather than squeezing cash out of them would work better.",1,2022,11,06
211,family break,"love everything about this hotel. the staff are excellent. breakfast lovely and the location was great. easy access to the botantic gardens, zoo, NAC and lovely restaurants in drumcondra. will go again",4,2022,11,06

If I have to say the one thing that makes this hotel special it would be all the staff that work there they are all friendly and nothing is to much trouble. I look forward to staying there again soon thanks Guys.",5,2022,10,31
211,Excellent,"Couldn’t fault this hotel, prices were reasonable , breakfast was excellent, our room was spacious beds were very very comfortable, The staff were friendly and polite. this hotel has got the balance right. ",5,2022,10,30

211,"Great stay, friendly staff, spotless cant ask for more","Always have a lovely stay here, staff are excellent check in & check out is very easy. Rooms are spotless and a good size. The breakfast is excellent with a great choice and lovely staff. Large bathroom with a large shower separate to the bath.",5,2022,10,25
211,Everything was almost perfect,"For the price, the trade off is a half hour walk to most attractions. Everything else is just perfect. Our room was quite big, the bed was very comfy, the tv was huge and you can cast from your phone, with good enough internet to boot. There was a bit of noise from the hall but mostly we heard nothing and slept great.",5,2022,10,19
211,Above and beyond,"Brilliant stay at this hotel, the staff were amazing, especially Thirza who was exceptional. Incredibly comfortable beds and spacious rooms, great food especially the tempura cod, which was mouth watering. and wonderful service, brilliant!",5,2022,10,18
211,Good stay overnight,"We didn't see a lot of the hotel as we just stayed the night before heading for the airport early next morning. Therefore didn't try meals or bar on site. Booking was good value for money. 
Everything was just fine!",4,2022,10,18
211,"Goiod service, nice rooms.",As a solo traveller I found it a pleasant place to stay. The food was of a good quality  staff friendly and service from both the front desk and the bar staff was quick pleasant and competent in all aspects of the stay.,4,2022,10,17
211,Mixed feelings,"Nice enough hotel but a good 20 min walk from Dublin centre. Rooms were nice and clean but carpets need a good scrub. Staff friendly and helpful. Food intolerances not catered for. Area surrounding the hotel, and city generally, dirty and dog poo all over the place",3,2022,10,17
211,Customer Service at its best!,"I travel a lot for my job. I spend many evenings in “nice” hotels. For me it’s the customer service that makes the difference. My wife and I had a GREAT experience at this hotel. The staff was very welcoming when we arrived and throughout our stay.  We arrived before our room was ready and the manager and front desk staff were very accommodating in getting us into our room in a timely manner. The rooms were comfortable and the restaurant/bar were wonderful. AND our exceptional experience started even before we arrived with the outstanding support we received from Rebecca in their reservation department! This was a rather complicated trip with a conference in the middle and leasure time around that. Rebecca helped guide us through all of the logistical craziness sending multiple emails to lock it all down. She was highly responsive and pleasant throughout, and even greeted us upon our arrival. We would HIGHLY RECOMMEND this hotel to anyone visiting Dublin!!",5,2022,10,15
211,Disappointing service ,Poor bar service. Had to remind staff twice to finish my Guinness and serve. No attention to detail. Zero eye contact. Zero attention to detail. Took 20 mins to check in with receptionist. Staff member took full payment instead of pre authorization. ,2,2022,10,15
211,Croke Park Hotel 🏆 🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟,"10/10 
You have to stay here especially if it’s with family. 
The entire team were extremely friendly helpful and made the kids feel like it was their 2nd home. 

The reservations team, to reception to bar staff to breakfast staff were truly outstanding. 

The family room was good with a tv that allowed the kids to use chrome cast to watch their kids programs. 

The central location made everything so easy.",5,2022,10,12
211,"Conveniently located, bad smell ","Very nice hotel, conveniently located. Great underground parking included with stay. Rooms are very plain and cheap. Shower leaked all over floor. Hallways smelled horrible on 3rd floor. Very friendly staff and excellent breakfast buffet. ",4,2022,10,10
211,"Functionally good, with a few concerns","Our room was comfortable but being at the front of the hotel was noisy if the window was open or if the air conditioning was on, and hot otherwise. The door to the stairwell needed a room key and it rarely worked, the staff new it was a problem but didn't seem to be able to arrange for a repair. Breakfast was generally good with lots of choice, and the eggs were cooked in large batches and could be rubbery. ",3,2022,10,04
211,My kids love this hotel,"We’ll definitely come back again and recommend this place to our family and friends. Very clean and staff are super friendly, very accomodating. Its nearby the city and its also near the airport.kudos",5,2022,09,19

211,Beautiful Hotel,"Beautiful hotel with helpful, attentive staff. Parking garage available for hotel guests - they validate for you. We did not eat at the hotel, so can't comment on the restaurant/bar, but it seemed lively!",5,2022,09,11
211,The Croke Park and Keim,"Our first time visiting Ireland and it was magnificent. We would HIGHLY recommend staying at The Croke Park. It provides everything you need and the staff takes it over the top with there customer service. We like to walk and the hotel is literally a 10-15 minute walk to O'Connell Street and the heart of Dublin. We made the walk daily and took in everything we could. Anyone visiting Ireland would be very pleased staying at this hotel and like I mentioned, the front desk staff is incredible, especially Keim. She made sure to greet us each and every day she saw us, asked what our plans were and suggested places to see and things to do. Just made our stay that much better. Thank you so much Keim, so much appreciated you and your kindness.

Respectfully,

Akie and Heather",5,2022,09,09
211,Wedding Party,"3 nights of pure bliss in the Liam McCarthy Suite along with my family of 20 spread over the hotel for our wedding weekend. From the front desk staff to the bar and lounge staff even down to housekeeping, I have never come across more attentive or friendly hotel staff. Even though our wedding was not at that location they still gave me the bridal treatment all the way. Best breakfast in Dublin in a long time, plenty to choose from and so fresh... Us Irish are all about the sausages, and they were quality. Our suite was fantastic, with large sitting room, Modern Décor, Huge bathroom, tones of wardrobe space, tones of room to lounge. We spent each evening in the hotel lounge and lobby with family and friends. Only 10 minute walk to Dublin City Centre. It doesn't get any better than this, I cannot recommend this hotel enough and 100% will be booking a Christmas shopping break.

211,"First time, hopefully not last.","Been to Dublin many times, never stayed here. But what a hidden gem. Sadly I was only here one night on business. No real time to check food etc. 
it’s a 15 minute walk from Connolly Train station. Located right beside the imposing and impressive Croke Park GAA stadium. Staff really friendly. Rooms modern. Bathrooms with large walk in showers and a bath. Restaurant and bar area quite large. It has an on-site gym but I never used it. Overall, a good quality 4 star hotel. Not in the heart of Dublin if you want the shops and bars on your doorstep, but a good alternative if you are taking in a game at Croke Park or just fancy a short break away from it all.",4,2022,09,06
211,Would recommend this hotel,Very good hotel. 20 min walk into Dublin centre. Staff very helpful. Good sized rooms and comfortable beds. Very clean. Restaurant good food and reasonably priced. if you book direct you get breakfast included.,5,2022,09,04
211,Great Hotel,I had a lovely stay in this hotel. The staff were friendly and efficient. The decor in the lobby and restaurant was really pretty. My room had a comfortable bed and a nice deep bath. The food in the restaurant was delicious.,5,2022,09,01
211,Amazing value and a lovely hotel,"Booked a room for one night, family of four, as another arrangement had fallen through. We were absolutely delighted with the hotel, the room, and the location (really handy for the airport the morning after). Amazing for the price.",5,2022,08,30
211,lovely hotel,"this is a beautiful hotel, i stayed here with my family a few days ago. everything was of a very high standard. The restaurant is excellent, the room was so spacious and clean. We will definitely stay here again.",5,2022,08,30
211,excellent location,"Very enjoyable visit. Allocated a wheelchair accessible room as requested.
Staff pleasant and very helpful, especially those in the restaurant for breakfast.
Onsite car parking is a huge bonus.
Have stayed before and will be back again.",5,2022,08,27
211,"Nice hotel, very poor service","Very disappointing visit with family recently.  The hotel itself is nice and rooms were very clean and comfortable.  
At the start of our evening, we were willing to overlook the poor service as I understand how difficult it is to get staff since Covid. However, by the end of our night, we were quite frustrated.  They were clearly short staffed,  or were not willing to pay for more staff. The staff that were serving us were clearly not trained. We waited ages to get served and when we did place our order, our waiter could not understand us and could not take the order properly.  I can get over this but his manner was extremely abrupt.  The food itself was very good but unfortunately 2 of our group only got their meals when everyone else had finished.  The same staff were serving in the bar when we moved there for drinks-again very slow service and not enough staff on.  They were not friendly or helpful in anyway.  There is a serious lack of basic training and no manager present throughout the night. 
Breakfast was similar - we had to ask for cutlery, milk or sugar.  The selection is average but did taste ok - more like a 3* star hotel breakfast. 
Don't think I will be returning.",3,2022,08,24
211,Came here through our #cie tour.,"This was a very nice hotel. Staff was friendly and courteous. Rooms were well appointed and clean. Their breakfast had plenty of options and the food was good. We did not dine here. The only downside here was our 2nd morning the shower drain backed up and flooded our floors.
   We will likely stay again given a chance we get back here.",3,2022,08,21
211,Great place to stay in Dublin,"Easy 20 min walk to most sites or short drive to further off ones.  Handy to have a car park on site.

Rooms and hotel beautiful, clean, neat and spacious.

Breakfast buffet had everything you could want, staff a little overstretched though.",5,2022,08,19
211,Wonderful staff and hotel!,"Our family stayed here our first night in Ireland and it was wonderful.  Not right downtown, but not far away.  We walked to the Hop On/Off tour stop and went everywhere we wanted for the day.  Coming from the USA , we arrived at the hotel very early in the morning, never expecting to be able to get a room until the afternoon, but they were more than ready for us and we were able to get into our room early!!  This was a welcome start to our trip and was so helpful!  Thank you to everyone at The Croke Hotel who showed us great Irish hospitality from day 1!",5,2022,08,18
211,Cleanliness and good atmosphere,"Location near the Croke Park, public areas really comfortable, clean and with an amazing atmosphere. Standard rooms for a family of 4 (double queen beds). A plus to the bathroom as there are shower and bath. Good breakfast.",5,2022,08,18
211,Great stay,"Beautiful lobby, rooms, bathrooms... Even the stationery is very tasteful!  Spacious, comfortable, quiet. Just what we needed.  Convenient location within reasonable  distance of most attractions.  Would definitely stay again.    ",5,2022,08,17
211,Nice modern hotel not too far away from downtown Dublin or the Airport,"Enjoyed our stay at The Croke Park.  We spent 2 weeks in Ireland and the beds (and especially the down pillows) were the best we slept on the night we slept at The Croke Park.  The fact that it's reasonably close to the action in downtown Dublin (a 20 to 25 minute walk) and to the airport, and has free parking, is a plus.  It was also very reasonably priced compared to most Dublin hotels.  We would definitely stay there again!",5,2022,08,17
211,City break,This hotel is ideally located for a family break in Dublin. The staff are very friendly and helpful. The food in the bar is excellent quality but service was very slow. Breakfast quality could be better. ,4,2022,08,17
211,Very nice hotel set in Croke Park area.,A very comfortable and well appointed hotel directly across from Croke Park. We appreciated the good parking facilities and AC while visiting during a heat wave in Dublin. Staff were helpful and very pleasant. The area lacks alternatives to hotel breakfast which was steeply priced.,4,2022,08,16
211,Birthday celebrations,A little break to celebrate my friends birthday we are big gaa fans and to wake up looking at croke park was such a bonus the are very helpful and friendly and only a few minutes into town in a taxi we travelled the weekend of the 12th august ,5,2022,08,16
211,Family of 4 - Fantastic Time,"We had a fantastic stay. Staff couldn't have done more. Room was very spacious with up-to-date amenities. We had room 227 and had views of the stadium and passing trains and planes which our kids loved to watch. 55' TV in the room so kids could watch their cartoons at night before bed. Shower separate from the bath and great pressure.  Very nice feel about the hotel. The sideline bar has a large projector screen with a gas fire always on, which made for a lovely homey feel. Hotel a short walk to all the hustle and bustle of the main town. Lovely Georgian houses lining the streets Along the way. We will recommend to our friends and family ",5,2022,08,15
211,"Lovely hotel, convenient location & helpful staff","Great long weekend with my mum. We were celebrating my birthday and the staff were kind to upgrade our room & let us check-in 4 hours early. 

Lovely outdoor drinking & dining spaces (even for breakfast - make sure to ask!)

15 minute walk to city centre or 5 mins to a bus stop. Staff were very helpful with directions, printing boarding passes and ordering taxis. 

Would definitely recommend if you like a city break but enjoy a quiet evening slightly away from the bustling city. 

This is the second hotel I’ve stayed in Doyle group, not been disappointed so far!",5,2022,08,15
211,Far from main attractions,"This hotel was clean, staff were friendly and efficient. Everything about our stay was fantastic but we did find it far from Dublins main tourist areas. We had to walk a long way to get a bus or to take a cab closer to the sights we wanted to see. If you were going to a concert at the arena it would have been an exceptional location. ",4,2022,08,14
211,Family Stay at the Croke Park Hotel,"We recently stayed for 2 nights at The Croke Park Hotel with two children and our stay exceeded all expectations. Rebecca was so helpful when making our reservation  and our first impressions with the staff at reception were exceptional. Throughout the stay the staff in each department were superb, reception, breakfast, evening meal and housekeeping - all so welcoming, so professional and a credit to the hotel. The food was out of this world, I had a superfood salad and burger on the first night and steak with triple cooked trips on the second night - the nicest steak I have had in years. The spread at breakfast was incredible and there was something for everyone - continental, full Irish, porridge, overnight oats, pancakes, waffles etc. The children had the waffles and were on cloud nine. The room was so comfortable with two double beds and a large TV with chromecast so the children were able to enjoy movies cast from my own phone on both evenings. The bathroom was beautiful with lovely products. The highlight of the stay was the Executive Lounge which we called in to several times - a fabulous room with a balcony looking out on to Croke Park - rooms on the 4th floor are slightly more expensive to avail of this Lounge but worth every penny as there is a fabulous coffee machine there, bottled water and light refreshments. Each floor has a GAA great opposite the lift - Nicky Rackard from Wexford, John Joe Reilly from Cavan, Christy Ring from Cork and John Tull Dunne from Galway - one from each province. There was also a charger available to charge my EV in the carpark. Everything needed for a comfortable stay was at our fingertips. We also did the Croke Park tour which was fantastic. We enjoyed our stay so much and would highly recommend it to all, for comfort, location, good food and pleasant atmosphere - Croke Park Hotel has it all.",5,2022,08,11
211,Clean & Comfortable,The hotel is very well located for buses or a brisk 15minute walk to the city centre. The room was very clean and exceptionally comfortable and the accommodation team seem to take extensive pride in their work & department which is a credit to them. ,4,2022,08,09
211,"This is a two-star hotel at best. If you’re American, the Croke Park Hotel is akin to a Motel 6.","As soon as we walked into our second-floor room, we were hit with a musty smell. There was a dampness to the air, which permeated the room. The beds had the cheapest sheets imaginable (like a thick tissue paper). The room had a color scheme from the 70s and clearly has not been updated in years. Wallpaper was peeling off, the shower had mold and grime peeking out through worn caulking. Sprinkles of mold could be seen on the shower tiling as well. To make matters worse, two of our towels had stains. When walking the hallways, you could pick up the faint smell of cigarette smoke. We arrived after midnight and could have asked to switch rooms, however during check-in we had heard another guest requesting to move rooms due to a bad smell. Not wanting to take a chance on landing a room that was worse, we tried our best to get a good night's sleep and checked out as soon as possible the next morning.

The staff was friendly and do not deserve any flak for the quality of the hotel. The responsibility lies with ownership. This hotel clearly tries to milk as much money out of their rooms as possible without updating them. This is their right, however the Croke Park Hotel has absolutely no business calling itself a four-star hotel. The only thing four-star about this hotel is the price they charge for their rooms.",1,2022,08,06
211,Not near anything other than Croke Arena,"Stayed here at the end of a tour, and the tour company had selected this hotel for the group. This hotel is across the street from the Croke Arena. Other than that, it is located in the middle of No Where: We could not find any restaurants, stores, groceries or attractions nearby. You will need to take a taxi to get anywhere.  We had no choice but to eat dinner at the hotel. 

Rooms are small and nothing special. Room had a couple bathroom items and only a few TV channels. Nice lobby with tables and chairs but how much time do you spend in the lobby? Hotel does have a gym with some equipment. Back of hotel has train/tram running by it but it wasn't noisy. 

The restaurant/bar is typical hotel food: Not so good and a bit pricey. I wasn't feeling well and asked for a roll or some crackers to eat while waiting for dinner. They brought a few pieces of very dry, horrible brown bread and charged me $4 for it (they didn't say there would be a $4 charge). Buffet breakfast was typical hot Irish buffet.",3,2022,08,05
211,Great value. Poor sleep.,"I really like the location, the cost and the restaurant. The hotel is clean and modern and safe. I would have given it a rave review if it wasn’t for the bed. The covers were too thick and the AC want powerful enough so I overheated. The bed was also a twin so it was too small to have a comfortable sleep with my wife. To be fair I’m 6 foot 2. The room was nice and the bathroom was great. If the bed was a little bigger and the AC stronger it would have been 5 stars.",3,2022,08,05
211,"Good hotel, great price and service",Book direct with the hotel to get the best price and options. Tried other agency initially and found we paid €60 less direct. Spacious car parking and 15 min walk/ easy access to centre of Dublin. Plenty of taxi options otherwise.,4,2022,08,02
211,"Good location, eat elsewhere.","Treat this as an expensive B&B, ideal location for Croke park but I suggest you get your meals elsewhere as the service is slow., very slow. Main course arrived c. 90 minutes after ordering, had to go and seek cutlery which did not arrive with the food.",2,2022,08,01
211,Lovely hotel let down by poor service in bars and restaurants,"Poor service lets this lovely hotel down.  I was actually quite shocked at how slow and poor the service was.  The staff in the bar and restaurant clearly lacked experience.  I get how affected the hospitality industry has been by Covid etc but honestly this was pretty bad compared to other places.   Train your staff properly, you are charging high prices for sub standard service.  The server at the bar struggled to get a simple order right.  We were on a GAA family package and when I asked another young server what menu we should order from she hadn’t even heard of the GAA package.  I mean, it’s Croke Park Hotel.! The wait for dinner was far too long.  The wait for drinks longer.  When dinner arrived it came for some and not others until much later on when those served first were finished.  Desserts arrived for 2 people and then 30mins later the rest of us.  The server did acknowledge and apologise for the desserts delay.  This is a lovely cosy hotel spoiled by the service, management need to take responsibility and train their staff teams, how they can send them out on the floor lacking in the basics is ridiculous especially given the price they charge.  I would love to return as the hotel is very nice but it would need an overhaul service wise before I’d spend money there again.",3,2022,07,30
211,Excellent staff and very helpful,Great place to stay with excellent staff who are extremely helpful and no issue is a problem. They are always there to make your stay as comfortable and will go to the extra mile to ensure your stay is to your expectations ,5,2022,07,28
211,"Stayed for work, would return for pleasure",Had the misfortunate of missing the all Ireland final the day before I stayed!! But the hotel and hotel staff were brilliant. Will return in the future. The supporting the local GAA club will ensure my return. Great way to support local GAA ,5,2022,07,27
211,Average,Overpriced. Poor service in general in bar and restaurant areas. Food itself tasted fine but nothing to write home about. Inexperienced staff. Room booked for four but water only provided for two for some reason. Disappointing overall. ,3,2022,07,25
211,Didnt stay but Customer service was above and beyond.,"I was calling around looking for a nice weekend away for me and my wife i called The Croke Park looking for availability and we  delt with Rebecca in reception/bookings who was nothing but above and beyond in her advice and recommendations, even though we didnt spend our time with TCP we definitely will be staying next time with them due to this excellent customer service, Again Rebecca is a true asset to this company.",5,2022,07,22
211,An Excellent Stay & Hats off to the staff!,"We a family of four recently stayed at The Croke Park hotel from booking our stay to departure I firstly have to compliment the staff they could not have been more welcoming, always smiling and ready to assist with any requests.
We had our breakfast, lunch and dinner in the hotel and the food & service was excellent with plenty of options for both adults and children.
Room standards are excellent and spacious and if you have any kids loving GAA to see the smiles on their faces waking up to a view of Croke Park is special.
Already looking forward to our next stay at The Croke Park Hotel!!",5,2022,07,19
211,Top Class,"Absolutely outstanding stay on Saturday night. A small mix up with the room was swiftly resolved by Lisa at check in. Throughout our stay she made it her business to ensure everything was ok for us. Every single member of your staff working that week end (all Ireland final by the way) could not have been more helpful, courteous and friendly. We travel a bit and what we experienced at the weekend was just phenomenal. Can you please make sure the Croke Park team see this message especially Lisa. Security could not have been more friendly as well especially with their increased workload over the weekend. Top class food and top class spotless room. Just Wow.",5,2022,07,19
211,Nice Property. Nice People.,"We spent our first night here after flying into Dublin. We were all a bit frazzled from driving and flying for long hours with kids. The staff was incredibly nice and understanding. The room was also wonderful. Very comfortable beds. We chose to not eat there, but took a path along a little creek in the morning to a great Crepe place. It was about a 5-7 minute walk along the canal. Definitely a great place to start our adventures.",5,2022,07,17
211,Great Hotel ... A little off the beaten path,"Room was great, front desk staff were very kind and helpful.  Hotel is well appointed and nicely decorated.  The hotel on non-game days is lovely. ... However, it does get crazy during game days and if you are not coming for a game, sadly I would recommend you stay elsewhere during game days as it is a bit overwhelming, (and this isn't the hotels fault, it's the clientele during games - kids running in halls, intoxicated people everywhere, etc).  The hotel during non game days was just lovely.  The hotel is a bit from the main city area, but a $10 cab fair got us right into town and when we walked back one evening, while still light out from main city/town, it took about 25 minutes.  We did walk through a little bit of a sketchy area and I would not recommend the walk in the dark or after bars close.",4,2022,07,12
211,Overnight Stay,"Lovely hotel to stay in. Staff very welcoming and accommodating. Food was delicious. Breakfast great choice to choose from. Lovely spacious rooms with a big tv. Had a great nights sleep as did the rest of my family. Lovely toiletries  and shower was very refreshing. Just 5 minutes from city centre from car or taxi. Will definitely be back again.
",5,2022,07,12
211,Average,"We had been in Dublin for the All Ireland Semis. We stayed across the city the Saturday night and in the Croke Park Sunday night. We expected the noise and huge volume of people so that dis not bother us. We had a meal in the restaurant and it was ok. Service was fine.
Room was clean and generally had no issues.
Breakfast in the morning was not great. Maybe it was because of the busy weekend but the staff were very inattentive in the morning. We had to tey many times to ask a server to take our tea and coffee order. 
The actual cooked breakfast was quite cold also. Maybe we arrived at a bad time...9.30?🤷‍♀️ 
Unsure if I would stay here again.",3,2022,07,11
211,AWFUL,"We stayed at the Croke Park hotel on 2 occasions over the past month for football and wouldn’t recommend. The service from breakfast to bar service was awful. Alot of drinks unavailable.  The main bar had a very dull atmosphere, no back round music.  We thought on such a big  footballing weekend (all Ireland semi final)  they could at least have a 2piece band in the bar. My friend asked for an omelette for breakfast which the chef was unable to fulfil her request and the waitress wasn’t sure if they had gluten free break, after 10 minutes returned to say yes that had it and another 10 mins then to get the toast.  We received coffee upon request just as we were finishing our breakfast.  Booked an executive room with access to executive lounge which was offered a fridge full of water, tea/coffee, some fruit and chocolate muffins. A bar which wasn’t open and no bar staff in attendance. Absolutely no perks. We requested a camp bed for my 10year old daughter, yes we got this but no pillows or duvet!  All round a bad experience for paying over £400 for a night. Wouldn’t recommend ",2,2022,07,10
211,"Great service, mediocre location, technology issues","Staff is great, very responsive. Room was fine. Food is good (we only had dinner). On 2 different occasions there were issues processing my credit card (they acknowledged it was their readers and not my card), in one case the gentleman who delivered our room service meal had to come back to the room to re-process the charge. Wifi was spotty. No fan in the room like we had with other hotels in Ireland, and the in-room safe was not operational (there was a sign on the room door indicating that we could use the main safe deposit box for free, which seemed like a hassle).

You can walk to the city center, but it's a bit of a hike. Right across from Croke Park, which is great if you are headed to or from there, but less great if you arrive on a game day and want any kind of cocktail -- or quiet.",4,2022,07,07
211,Excellent,Absolutely excellent from check in to check out the staff are very friendly and the location is just great only 10 to 15 mins walk to the city the food in the bar is v good and the breakfast was excellent would highly recommend staying hear ,5,2022,07,05
211,Overpriced unclean hotel,"I stayed here for one night mid week recently on business. I needed a taxi to a meeting so I booked one at the reception desk 2 hours in advance. When I arrived down for the taxi there was none there and I was told I'd have a 40 min wait - totally unacceptable given I'd pre-booked. The attitude of the lady at reception was terrible, she shrugged her shoulders at me and didn't help at all. On arrival to the room there were dirty room service plates left outside various bedroom doors, I thought they'd be taken away shortly as there were lots of housekeeping staff around the corridors. The dirty plates, empty glasses and bottles etc were still there 24 hours later when I was checking out, Disgusting. I won't be returning and would not recommend this hotel to anyone.",2,2022,07,04
211,good hotel,"decent quality hotel, no real negatives apart from perhaps the location if ur in town as a tourist, it is walkable to the city centre but wouldnt want to do it every day. Staff were good, room was very comfortable, hotel was as clean as u would expect, decent breakfast at reasonable price, it ticked all the boxes i need in a hotel",4,2022,07,03
211,"Great location, good facilities, poor staff and management","Really nice hotel with good facilities and very comfortable rooms let down badly by poor staff, poor management and mediocre food. Location is God for anyone travelling into Dublin from the north side ",3,2022,07,02
211,Horrible experience,"What a dump! There was garbage all all over the floor, the carpet was dirty and the lifts did not work. Worse yet, the 300 euro/night rate did not include breakfast. Do not stay here. I would have been better off sleeping the in airport on the floor.",1,2022,06,30
211,Medium overall,"Medium level overall, but the best option if you have an event at the Croke Park, just opposite. Rooms are ok but breakfast is too 'production line' style. Some options but too boring for more than 2-3 days visit.",3,2022,06,27
211,Poor Value for $,"Had not planned to spend a night in Dublin but faced with unanticipated travel delays, found ourselves at the Croke Park Hotel…on the day of finals which meant that the area was literally overrun. I read someone else’s comments about the hotel being overrun by Americans. On our occasion, it wasn’t Americans but good old Irish folks coming out to cheer on their teams. In my books, it matters not the country of origin of the people who are running amok in a hotel, but the fact that the hotel makes no attempt at control, nor have the staff required to deal with a surge in attendees. Children repeatedly setting off fire alarms, rampaging through the halls, stomping through gardens on the patio. Hotel staff are not child-minders, to be sure, but allowing the number of people in the bar and lobby that was witnessed cannot translate into a good customer experience (I suppose good customer service for some is simply getting to pound back multiple pints while awaiting a match. To each their own). Aside from the general crowd, linen bags and room service trays and bottles lined the halls, room was very average for very high price. Worst of all, this place is in a desert, as far as restaurants are concerned. Not a great area of Dublin, so we ordered room service. There seemed to be some alright items on the room service menu which the hotel notes is available until “late”. Who knew—9:30 is TOO late! Ordered 2 sandwiches which could only be described as something a child might make when packing a school lunch. Freezing cold bread and ham, no cheese as promised, with crisps on the side. Sandwich #2 was simply weird. Husband thought he was ordering some sort of grilled veg sandwich, turns out it was a couple of (again freezing cold) pieces of deep fried zucchini and red pepper on cold bread, smeared with odd beet purée. One half of sandwich was missing it’s bread “lid” (not that it mattered, sandwich was inedible). I’m not a “rude American” (as some reviewers like to refer to anyone other than domestic tourists),  but a polite Canadian
who is generally appreciative of a bit of effort for the equivalent of a $500CDN room, dear in any country. Human resource shortages are a worldwide issue, but little things like not making sandwiches out of ice cold bread would be a suggestion. Will also add that when direct booking this hotel, we were sold an upgraded breakfast package, although hotel website clearly states breakfast is included. Haven’t experienced the breakfast yet, but my expectations are not high.
I notice that hotel management is dutifully responding to many poor ratings on trip advisor, offering future complimentary services. A nice gesture, but for international travellers you only get one chance. We come to Ireland frequently and won’t be staying at the Croke Park Hotel again.",2,2022,06,26
211,great stay at the croke park hotel,we had a great stay at the croke park hotel. the hotel bar and the food was excellent. the hotel room was clean and confortable. i never mentioned the check out time. it is 12 o'clock which is great as you can get your breakfast. return to your rokm get a shower and relax until the check out time. thank you for that.,5,2022,06,26
211,It's fine.,We were staying with friends so we got a cheaper room. Because of this it was fine but if you are going with a romantic partner it is maybe better paying a little extra as there are a few turn offs which may have hashed the vibe a little e.g. cleanliness of the room. For business and friend trips I'd recommend.,3,2022,06,26
211,Good location for The Croke Park but need to improve the service,"I have stayed the hotel to attend the event at The Croke Park. The hotel is located in front of the gate of The Croke Park. It is a few steps to get the gate.
The atmosphere on the ground floor is excellent since there are many chairs and tables with AC power. I could work there with the laptop during the event. 

They need to improve the service. One day during staying the hotel, there was no bed making at all. I asked to provide the set of new towels, but there was a shortage of facial towel. I didn't understand the shortage of towels at all.
Another improvement is the security box. The security box in the room doesn't work at all. It is assumed that the battery was gone. The hotel should check those facility at their maintenance activities.

I asked the front desk whether the shuttle bus goes to the city center. She replied that you'd better walk to get there. I am not sure that they have the shuttle bus.

There is no restaurant and shop around the hotel. The business for The Croke Park is ok. You will go to the city center if you would like to have the better lunch or night entertainments.",4,2022,06,25
211,Disaster ,"Came here to stay when going to the quarter final matches, very disappointed to say the least, we were also celebrating our dads birthday. He payed an extortionate amount for a room with two double beds, got to the room and only had a double and single with no  fridge in it! 

It went downhill from there, the meal was a disaster. We arrived for our booking tired and hungry after the game, there was little to no one in the restaurant at this point bare in mind. Served by a woman with very little English who didn't understand most of everything we said, 20 minutes later and no drinks, meal has already arrived as well. Try to get attention of server however no where to be seen, and also got some of the order wrong due to not understanding , I don't blame this waitress but the management who haven't provided adaquate training! The management were useless also just stood behind the desk the whole time providing no assistance- you expect great service for a hotel of this standard and the prices you are paying, simply not good enough! Will not be back ",2,2022,06,25
211,Great Place,"My husband and i stayed here last October due to having an operation in Dublin. The building is beautiful and internally exceptional. On arrival we were greeted well and nothing was a bother to them. The food was absolutely delicious. All in all the staff were very friendly and even gave us directions. 
Thanks

211,"Great rooms, brilliant service, good food","I always mistakenly associated the Croke Park Hotel as a hotel people probably just stayed in when going to see matches in the stadium across the road, so to my surprise, when i first stayed here I was pleasantly surprised by the beautiful interiors, large well decorated rooms, and the brilliant service.

It's a large, modern hotel, where staff are very welcoming and friendly, and the food and beverage is of a surprisingly high service. They often have bbq's and bbq buffets in their large courtyard whcih is really unique for a hotel in dublin. And really put in a lot of effort to have an exciting drinks menu  too",5,2022,06,24
211,Brilliant service,"We stayed in the hotel two weeks ago, and after a day out with my Dublin friends I invited them over to the hotel for some drinks and a bit to eat. We arrived at 9pm with no reservation, and there was no badtime to get a table for 7 of us. Natalie the manager in the bar, was brilliant getting us a quiet space. Her service, offering us drinks and talking through some cocktails and food available, was premium. There was a young waitress helping as well- sorry I missed her name -and the evening was outstanding.
Room was spacious and spotless clean - we only stayed one night. Reception staff were friendly at all times. 
I’ll definitely return here.",5,2022,06,23
211,"Nice public spaces, decent rooms, a little disorganized","Spent our last night in Ireland here.  Didn’t get our room
Keys until 10:30pm - so we paid $350 for a 12 hour stay.  Not quite worth the cost for a sleep & a shower.  getting a taxi to the airport proved challenging.",3,2022,06,19
211,Birthday treat.,"Well where to start. Had high expectations as this was not a cheap hotel, and it is also a sister hotel of the Westbury ( Doyle Collection). When we arrived we where greeted with the typical scene of Americans swarming over the entire lobby, being loud and inconsiderate and taking over the space. The staff looked stressed and overwhelmed! We got to the desk and checked in. I paid and got my room key, and my friends got theirs.
We Went to the room and initially where quite impressed. However there are elements in the room which need updated, as it feels a little outdated. I was also surprised to see a small cake wishing me a Happy Birthday. I thought the hotel had been extra considerate and seen that my birthday had been a few days previous. I was impressed!
However, It turned out a friend had ordered the cake and had left a €50 gift voucher at reception to be taken off the cost of the room as a present. Turns out they had forgotten at reception and proceeded to charge me the full price, spoiling my friends surprise. After having brought this to the attention of the manager we where offered two complimentary drinks, however the €50 voucher will take up to 5 days to be reimbursed. My fiends had a similar experience by being given a room that hadn’t been cleaned, which had dirty glasses and a half eaten cake in it. Oh btw the cake was disgusting, I honestly couldn’t eat it. couldn’t tell you what it was supposed to be.
The next day we went for breakfast, again met with a swarm of loud Americans who had taken over the attention of the already overstretched small serving team. We seated ourselves and went ahead and got our breakfast, we finally got some coffee after approaching a very busy young waitress who was being over run with demands by the large group of highly annoying loud Americans. Breakfast was mediocre at best, pastries where the ones that are bought in frozen pre made, overall very average! This is not a 4 star hotel, the service is mediocre. Hotels need to stop taking large parties of Americans who proceed to take over the hotel leaving little energy or time for other customers. We won’t be back as it’s way over priced and doesn’t deliver! What a disappointment!!
Oh and the area is fairly rough! Dublin isn’t looking it’s best these days! Very run down in places, lots of homeless and addicts on the streets, very little Garda presence!",2,2022,06,19
211,Not great,"We stayed Sat night 04 June.  We're not GAA fans so hadn't realised it was a busy GAA day.  We were bringing our daughter to her first big concert and arrived back to the hotel at 11am.
My daughter and son when to the room and myself and my husband fancied a drink to wind down.  I'm guessing it had been busy in the bar but by that time it was reasonably quite.  However, the bar staff were absolutely miserable.  It took an age to get served, no smiles, everyone was just completely down in the dumps and dragging their heels.  While we were standing there for 20 minutes you couldn't fail to notice that the 2 sets of external doors on opposite sides of the bar area were open.  It was freezing!
I spoke with the bar\ night manager who told me they were moving furniture and the doors would have to stay open until it was done.  To be fair, when we arrived I did  see them bring a sofa through one of the doors.  However, that was it.  Other couches were moved but internally, from the lobby into the bar area.  Nothing went through the door on the other side of the room at all, and they were escape doors which can be easily swung closed behind a person.  The night manager suggested we sit in the lobby, which we did, where every table was sticky and dirty with from the day, little comfort, zero atmosphere.  We had two drinks and the doors in the bar stayed open the whole time, all furniture moving had ceased and the bar manager was happily going about his other business, leaving them open.

This is the second time in awhile where I have experienced similar antics on behalf of bar staff who just want the customers gone.  Freezing them out is certainly a way to do it.   The contempt it shows for customers who have paid €300 for their room is outstanding.  Close the bar if you don't want the custom, but I guess, that's not the night mangers call.  

I've left 3 stars as the breakfast and the breakfast staff were lovely.  The room was clean but the attitude of the bar manager and his manner let the place down.",3,2022,06,13
211,Clean spotless comfortable good carpark,I try to stay here whenever i sleep over in Dublin.  Nice rooms. Great bar.  I love the decking area and often go to BBQs on it which are to die for. I'll go again.  They seem to have cut back on the crafty beers in the bar. Lunch was really really good lots of choices.,4,2022,06,11
211,Reservations agent of the year!,"I have a loved one staying in the hotel and wanted to arrange something special, all the way from South Africa. I managed to get in touch with Rebecca , the reservations agent who helped arrange everything for me through email. She truly is such a helpful and friendly agent. 

Thank you once again Rebecca!!",5,2022,06,08
211,Great Stay,Enjoyed every minute of our Stay. Would definitely stay again. very handy for moving around Dublin. Great room and bed was so comfortable. Staff very friendly and efficient. Booked through booking.com but will book direct next time.,5,2022,06,08
211,Nice hotel but service lets it down,"Stayed here for a concert in St Anne’s Park. This is a lovely hotel in a good location with affordable parking options (free if you book your stay direct). However there were some aspects of service that let the hotel down. 

Firstly we were assigned our room, we had booked a double room and were met with what looked more like a family room with one very small double bed and a single bed. Myself and my partner are not large people and we were actually uncomfortable in this “double” bed. Definitely the smallest double I have seen in any hotel and smaller than our double bed at home. Maybe this is why we were allocated a room that also had a single bed? Two of our friends also stayed in the same hotel, booked the same room type as us and received a room with a kingsize bed. So it seems like there are inconsistencies in the rooms. 

My partner then went down to the bar at 4:50pm to order some cocktails for us. He was told that they couldn’t do them as they wouldn’t be serving cocktails until later. We were due to be going out shortly so he agreed to purchase a gin and tonic and a beer instead. He then asked the bar staff out of interest what time would they be serving cocktails from and they said 5pm! Surely they could have made an allowance of 10 minutes to prepare the cocktails at 4:50 when he asked, or else let us know that they would be starting in 10 minutes if we wanted to wait. 

This is a nice hotel with a lot of potential but this was generally a bit on the disappointing side for our first time staying here.",3,2022,06,06
211,Not great,Stayed here for 40th wedding anniversary. Very disappointed with availability of gluten free foods as I’m coeliac. Needs to improve with availability of choice. Not good enough for the prices being charged,2,2022,06,01
211,Great Stay,"We enjoyed finding such a nice hotel in Croke Park. Everything was first class. We would stay there again. 20 minute walk to action in downtown Dublin, and a 10 minute walk to buses to the airport. Our room was quiet, which we were looking for.",5,2022,05,31
211,Staff couldn’t do enough for us,"Me and my partner booked this hotel as we were going to a family function nearby, my sister and her partner also booked. Unfortunately due to their system going down they had overbooked and got in contact to say we had to stay in another hotel near the airport. Due to the party being around the corner from Croke park this was quite a big inconvenience for us as we could no longer walk about freely but Edele was fantastic in giving us what we needed to make the change somewhat manageable. She had fantastic communication given she was dealing with multiple over bookings. She was nothing short of a delight to talk to. 
Upon check in day we had arrived to the Croke park to have a complimentary free lunch for the inconvenience before we got a taxi to the other airport - we spoke with Tomasz who directed us to lunch. After lunch we had booked the taxi and heading to wait and Tomasz and chased us down after us to tell us there had been a cancellation and we could stay after all. We were delighted to be able to stay closeby, after entering the room he had phoned to say another room was free for my sister and her partner when she arrived in Dublin. We both got a breakfast included to apologise also. Tomasz  And Edele went above and beyond for us and we wanted to thank them for everything they done. Couldn’t fault the lunch or breakfast & all staff was polite & easygoing. Room was spotless.
Thanks again 
Would definitely stay again

Great location- 15 minute walk into the centre. Opposite Croke Park. Fairview Park - 10 minute walk. 5 minute walk from nearest Dublin Bike collection point.

HOWEVER, bar needs more staff on a match day. Queued for 25 mins for overpriced drink in plastic cups. They seemed to run out of glasses as they were so busy.

bar staff working very hard, but under a lot of pressure. No floor staff clearing tables. ",4,2022,05,21
211,"Just about very good, could be better though!","Stayed here for 3 nights. The first room we were given, we had to complain about the poor comfort of the mattress, room 149. It urgently needs replacing, to their credit they relocated us to another room which was much much more comfortable, although a bit noisy. Neither room had a mini fridge, which our friends did have. Rooms are fine but fairly basic for this type of hotel. Food and drink were good although expensive, which is pretty normal for hotels like this. There are plenty if better options close by. Overall it was a bit better than average hence the very good.",4,2022,05,20

211,good location with parking,"Nice modern hotel with on site parking

The Croake Park Hotel is a larger hotel with many amenities including on site parking ( 10 Euros?). The room was large and well equipped.  The bathroom is modern with both a separate tub and shower. The rooms are clean and the location is quiet. Its about a 15 minute walk to get to the main part of town in which there are restaurants and pubs. We walked from the hotel to the Trinity College area.  

Breakfast was not included with our hotel although there is an on site restaurant as well as a fitness center. I especially like the hotel for its cleanliness.",5,2022,05,14

Shame",3,2022,03,10
211,A fabulous stay with friends,"I stayed with a group of friends last week. I highly recommend the Croke Park hotel for a leisure stay. The twin bedrooms were immaculately clean, spacious and well decorated. The service from the staff at reservations, reception, meeting and events and the bar rivals many 5 star hotels in the city. Breakfast the next morning was delicious, lots of hot food choices and a beautiful room. 
Looking forward to staying again soon",5,2022,03,10
211,Fantastic,"Amazingly friendly staff on arrival. We were a few hours early and our rooms weren’t ready but the team kindly took our bags and stored them safely for us until we arrived back later that day. 
Room was spacious, clean and comfortable. 
We went out in the evening and got a taxi back to the hotel. The taxi driver didn’t accept card and was incredibly unhelpful but the night manager noticed we were having difficulty and came out and paid our taxi fare without question and got us inside safely. 
Overall, a great experience and would absolutely recommend this hotel if you are looking for somewhere away from the hustle and bustle but close enough to enjoy Dublin",5,2022,03,07
211,Amazing hotel and super staff,"Stayed with a group of friends and couldn’t recommend the Croke park hotel enough. Staff were so friendly and attentive. The twin rooms were super spacious, immaculately clean, tastefully decorated and so comfortable. Breakfast the next morning was very good too. Buffet options with plenty choice, eggs ordered fresh from the kitchen and drinks served to the table! Couldn’t ask for more. We also had a small meeting room for the group to have drinks and hangout before we went for dinner, brill!! Thank you to  the hotel for a really great stay. Already looking forward to the next visit 😊",5,2022,03,07

211,Up for the match,Room set up for 2 people whilst 3 people stayed. Overall a good experience but the hotel really needs to work on its bar service particularly after a match. They lost sales because of insufficient bar service areas.,4,2022,02,21
211,Lovely stay,"Stayed here on 19th Feb as a couple on a B & B, with 3 course evening meal package (""Make a night of it"" offer) at a cost of €259.   Completed online check in advance of arrival so just had to collect the keys when we arrived - the process was very efficient.  The room (437) was lovely - with a huge & very comfortable bed.   The en-suite had both a bath & separate level deck shower as well as a huge mirror, good light & lots of shelf space.   There was a good amount of hanging space for clothes as well as all the usual facilities that one expects in a good hotel.   The hotel was busy due to the Dublin -v- Mayo match in Croke ark and some of the bar staff seemed overwhelmed by the occasion but it was generally a very positive experience.   The location is very convenient for Croke Park but is 1.3 miles away from the City Centre (middle of O'Connell Street).",5,2022,02,21
211,6 for dinner on Sunday,"The Hotel is located very well from the city center.
Very clean. Dining area very comfortable lovely fire.. Outdoor areas for smokers.

211,Handy beside the stadium. Nice area.,"The hotel is nice, straight acrossfrom the stadium, beside the royal canal, you could happily walk along it on a nice day.

211,Family stay,Excellent family stay. Friendly and excellent location for visit to croke park. Atmosphere good. Food good. Staff excellent and friendly. Match day provides a great experience for all. Would highly recommend ,5,2022,01,31
211,Sort out the internet,"This is my fourth visit to the Croke Park. Always happy to return. Staff are always friendly, greet you as they pass. That is the most important thing to say about it. 
Having  to sign in and out of the internet is very annoying. Is it my fault r, as I think, a problem with the hotel. 
There was a large crowd this weekend and everything went well as far as I was concerned. Rooms are comfortable but I had a problem with the heating. Would be helpful if there was an instruction on how to use it? 
Despite the above, I will be back. There is no other hotel in the city I’ve found to better it. Especially the secure parking. Thanks to Jenny and the Filipino lady on reception. Sorry I can’t recall her name. And the breakfast staff were v attentive, checking if I needed anything extra.",4,2022,01,30
211,Excellence,"I’ve recently stayed in The Croke Park, after what has been an extremely difficult time for the hotel industry, and delighted to report that it has maintained its high levels of service, cleanliness, comfort with a friendly welcoming atmosphere. The foyer and dining areas are beautiful and relaxing while the choice and quality of breakfast was perfect. The Croke Park still has the most comfortable bedrooms of any hotel I’ve stayed in and you are guaranteed to have a great sleep. Overall, I was delighted with every aspect of my stay and cannot wait to get back to one of my favourite hotels!",5,2022,01,30

211,Christmas Stopover at the Croke Park Hotel,My wife and I had an overnight stay and evening meal in the hotel on 3rd December following a visit to the RDS Craft Fair. It was our first time staying at the hotel. We were both really impressed by the customer friendly service we received from staff - they were so helpful.

211,"Fab hotel, great value for Dublin","We booked an overnight family trip to go to a concert. The hotel is beautiful,  spacious, spotlessly clean and the staff very friendly and efficient. 

We had a large family room with two double beds, comfy pillows,a safe, fridge. The bathroom had separate shower and bath.  Free no password WiFi was great. Bar food was excellent.",5,2021,12,05
211,Breakfast was seriously disappointing,"A warm welcome at reception, beautiful hotel, lovely dinner but the breakfast was just so disappointing- food for our table arrived in drinks and drabs, most of the food was cold, the toast never arrived, we ran out of milk and there were no staff available to ask, most of the food was uneaten and nobody to notice. Staff that were on duty were very friendly but clearly too busy to deal with everyone.",3,2021,11,29
211,Excellent All round,"Smart, comfortable, always clean, familiar staff. The food is always good.
The rooms are comfortable with individual AC.
The bar/restaurant area is really nice and gives the sense that you are not in a hotel bar/restaurant",5,2021,11,17
211,Family trip,"Excellent location for a visit to Dublin city, zoo , show or shopping.
Hotel is beautifully decorated with excellent staff and accommodation. 
Peaceful nights sleep so close to the city.
Safe free car park ",5,2021,11,14
211,Clean and comfortable,Very clean and comfortable. Mostly friendly staff. Would stay again as very convenient for us visiting family. Problem with key cards had to renew everyday which was a bit annoying. Plugs in room not very convenient,4,2021,11,09
211,Family stay great hotel,"Great location if interested in gaa , we did the croke Park tour. Reception area is gorgeous, as is the bar. Carpark on site is very handy I'll definitely return, that was our 2nd family visit there. We didn't go into city so I can't comment on location in relation to city centre. ",4,2021,11,06
211,Comfortable and friendly,"Nice hotel next to the Croke Stadium and about 15 minutes by walk to the city center.

At the reception they gave us tourist information that we required and personel was nice and friendly",4,2021,11,03
211,American style spaciousness,"This is a spacious good quality hotel with large bedrooms. It is comfortable, nicely decorated, clean and well run with good parking in basement.

211,Excellent stay,"Really enjoyed our stay. Excellent service and great value. Couldn’t recommend it enough. Had the breakfast, which was excellent and all of the staff were helpful and cheery. Location was also central as we were travelling for a music festival it was ideal. No issues whatsoever and really enjoyed the stay. Rooms were also very comfortable!",5,2021,11,01
211,Very Friendly experience,"Stay with 2 kids under 3, we had appointments for both kids in temple street hospital. All staff we meet were very friendly and very accommodating. The kids got coloring books on arrival which was a lovely touch. We had lunch one of the days at the bar, the staff were very friendly and engaging to the kids which help keep them entertained while we waited for our meal. 

We stayed a Wednesday & Thursday night and didn’t hear any noise our room was at front of the hotel 

There was free under ground car parking with our booking and which is great. Would definitely book again and recommend for a family staying in Dublin.",5,2021,10,30
211,Great staff,"Just returned yesterday from a lovely stay in the croke Park hotel. Family room had 2 double beds and a single and still had space for a cot. Plenty of storage space. The room had a massive TV with access to chrome cast which meant we could stream netflix etc from our phones. This proved handy when we were cooped up in the room with a sick baby! There was also a nespresso machine, kettle & fridge. We had access to the executive lounge which was a nice space to sit and relax with a cup of coffee.
We ate in the hotel one night as part of our package. The menu was quite limited although the food was nice. Only one vegetarian option. Breakfast was great, plenty to choose from although most things had to be ordered from the table due to covid restrictions. A menu of what was available to order would have been handy instead of having to keep asking staff. 
The main selling point of this hotel though is the staff. All staff we encountered were extremely friendly and helpful. My young daughter was sick in the restaurant and the staff went out of their way to help us, from the lady who helped us clean up, the waiter who insisted on carrying my dinner up to the bedroom for me to the other staff who offered help and expressed concern. Even the next evening, a staff member recognised my husband and offered to arrange for a drink to be sent up to the bedroom for me. All staff made an effort to speak to my children and ask about their day and they really enjoyed the activity packs given to them in the restaurant. 
We will definitely stay in the hotel again on our next visit to Dublin and would recommend it to anyone wishing to be close to attractions without being directly in the city centre.",5,2021,10,27
211,Fantastic family staycation,Excellent family staycation. Fantastic hotel experience. Staff excellent and friendly. Breakfast tasty and delicious and staff so friendly. Room was very spacious with all amenities. So handy to have on site free parking. Will definitely be returning.,5,2021,10,26

211,Business trip with group of 20,Our group of 20 stayed for 2 nights.  We received a very warm welcome.  The rooms were all very comfortable and clean.  Breakfast and dinner were both exceptional and the atmosphere in the bar was very pleasant and inviting.  We will stay again.,5,2021,10,21
211,Poor check-in and position of the rooms,"With check-in we received rooms with doors to escalator and windows to a busy street. After we asked for other rooms, we received rooms almost nearby with windows towards the busy street. The hotel was not fully booked and rooms at the quiet hotel side should not have been a problem. So the comfort was not good.
But the restaurant with breakfast and dinner was very good.
Public transport with bus or train into the city center of Dublin was just 10 min. walking.
",3,2021,10,17
211,A Fabulous Stay at a Fabulous Hotel 4* but really should be 5*,"We stayed at The Croke Park Hotel for a few days at the end of September this year and had the best time.  Thankfully there were multiple COVID provisions in place and we felt very safe during our stay there. The Hotel itself is beautifully decorated with luxuriously modern furniture and stunning decor throughout.  The Reception desk staff were extremely courteous, pleasant and helpful. The room was spotlessly clean and it was a delight to see a coffee maker complete with capsules ready for use (oh and tea lovers the tea provision was incredible too with loads of flavours to choose from)   The bathroom was spotlessly clean and well stocked with The White Company toiletries which were plentiful and truly luxurious!! We ate both evenings in the Sideline Bar & Bistro - (I am Vegan) this is usually a huge problem when eating out but not here.  There were numerous choices and I opted for the Mushroom Risotto OMG it was sooooo delicious, my Husband's Steaks were terrific too with gorgeously chunky chips to munch his way through!!!!  We had a fabulous stay and we would highly recommend this Hotel for a stay at any time.  We'll be going back again soon!!",5,2021,10,12
211,Would highly recommend this Hotel.,"Fantastic Hotel. 

All staff were amazing from check in to check out and everyone in between. 

The food is so good we ended up eating in the restaurant both nights of our stay.

Bedrooms were very comfortable and clean.

All covid regulations in place and adhered to. Regular sanitising stations and all staff wearing masks. 

We could not fault the hotel or staff on anything and have already booked to go back.",5,2021,10,07

Breakfast was amazing with an excellent choice on the menu definitely something for everyone's taste and the staff were very helpful with recommendations of breakfast choice also the coffee was spot on for me and it set us up for the day .Added bonus was the cromcast in the bedrooms could sit back relax and stream netflix on the 55 inch screen !!

211,The Croke Park - Fab hotel always,"First visit back to The Croke Park in over a year due to covid.  Delighted to be back to experience the fantastic hospitality that has always been consistent over the many years I've had occasion to stay.  The reception area, bar and restaurant have all been beautifully re-designed  and decorated to provide plenty of open spaces that allow social distancing.  That said though there is a great atmosphere in the Sideline bar along with a good food and drinks menu. Delighted to see familiar faces among the staff as well as plenty of new staff  who were well-trained and friendly.  Peter, the Bar Manager as ever doing a great job.  Rooms are comfortable and well-equiped which always guarantees a good night's sleep.  Can't fault the hotel in any way and would highly reccommend for an overnight or longer stay in Dublin with plenty of free parking.",5,2021,10,03
211,I can not wait to go back!,"We were a party of 8 and spent the entire day and night at the hotel. The service, the staff, the food, the attentiveness of the staff. Despite the many restrictions in place in todays world we barely felt this as the staff handled everything so professionally. The food was outstanding  every meal. Your staff though, every customer touchpoint was exceptional. ",5,2021,10,03
211,Lovely hotel worth a visit,Dined in hotel with friends last night and some stayed over. It was the nicest hotel in terms of friendly staff who were so helpful. They just went the extra mile. The hotel has a really lovely atmosphere gorgeous decor  & is very central yet removed from the busy city centre . The food was lovely & a good selection on the menu. I would highly recommend a visit. It definitely ticks all the boxes.,5,2021,10,03
211,Superb hotel for a city stay,"This hotel is conveniently located to the city centre with good car parking facilities. Within 1-15 minutes walk you will be right in the middle of the main city shopping areas.
The hotel has good, well equipped rooms and the excellent staff ensure your stay from checkin through to departure will be of the highest quality.
The bar area is welcoming and spacious and the restaurant serves quality food whether breakfast, lunch or dinner.
",5,2021,10,02
211,Delighted to return,"We recently stayed in this hotel to go to a match. We’ve stayed many times in the past but this was the first visit of the year due to covid. I was really impressed, from the moment that we arrived to the moment we left, with the covid protocols in place. 

Masks worn by all staff and by guests, hand sanitising stations in many locations, plenty of notices, sealed rooms post cleaning, it all made our visit feel very safe. 

On top of this the accommodation was top class as always, with a lovely clean room and very comfortable beds, and the food at dinner and breakfast was great. We also ordered room service and it was delivered promptly and by a very friendly member of staff. All the staff we met from check in to check out were so welcoming and warm on what was a very busy weekend. 

Overall, we were delighted to be back visiting The Croke Park and are so glad to see that all the things that made our visits so great are still there and can’t wait for the next visit.",5,2021,09,23
211,Fantastic stay and felt so safe,We recently stayed in The Croke Park and had a fantastic stay. The covid protocols in place were of an incredibly high standard and made us feel very safe. The food and accommodation were superb and we can’t wait to return again.,5,2021,09,23
211,Weekend Stay. Fantastic staff.,We stayed in the hotel on one of the busiest days the All Ireland Football Final! We needed our room changed at the last minute due to a late change. Despite the hectic day and big crowd the staff were amazing. The receptionists were very considerate and assured us they would sort everything out. The Hotel Manager Allen Smullen was brilliant and made sure our stay in the hotel was a very enjoyable one. The Deputy General Manager Sean Reid also made a point spoke to speak us that evening and check that everything was ok. Very few hotels can make you feel special but all the staff on duty were just amazing they made our stay even more memorable. We will be back.,5,2021,09,21
211,Great to be Back,Had the pleasure to return to the Croke Park Hotel on 11th September after more than 18 months. It was certainly worth waiting for. Friendly staff catering to your needs always with a smile.We had dinner in the evening and the food was of a very high quality. Rooms were bright and airy and the hotel was adhering to all Covid 19 policies which gave us great confidence. It was only open to residents which was a great plus for us.Nothing was too much trouble to the staff and they were always willing to help. It was a pleasure to be back and lets hope for many more stays in this hotel.,5,2021,09,17
211,Very average,"Have stayed here on a few occasions and all I can report is that the hotel has lost its edge. Overpriced for the quality of the product offered. 

Pros:
Bedroom was nice, comfortable bed, good quality toiletries (the white company), crisp bedding
Car parking is included

Cons
Evening meal was not great, very limited limited wine list. Chips were basically chunks of potatoes which were wet and slimy 
Breakfast was a real let down, was not offered any breads or croissants, or pastries. Surely these are a standard breakfast item and should be delivered to the table along with the orange juice and tea. Toast was not even offered.
Cooked breakfast was awful. The eggs looked like they had been cooked hours prior to being served. When I stayed the hotel was very quiet, so surely it’s not too much of an ask for eggs to be cooked to order. 

There is a 3 star hotel in the city centre which is far superior and cheaper. 

Overall I feel this hotel has let standards slip. For the price charged I expected a much better offering.",3,2021,09,16
211,Never disappoints,One of our favourite hotels in Ireland. We come her every year for our anniversary before setting off on a coastal trip stopping off and various destinations along the way. Before the COVID took over in 2020. Was great to be able to come across again.,5,2021,09,13
211,Great Hotel,"Only one night, but it was a very enjoyable stay. The receptionist were very helpful and printed out a map of the area for me. My room was at the rear of the hotel (on the opposite side from Croke Park). Unfortunately this was above the deliveries entrance which meant a bit of noise in the early morning. Apart from that the room was great with a massive TV. The bath filled very quickly with hot water. Towels were plentiful. Missing was a toilet brush. The double bed was luxurious, and I had a good sleep (deliveries excepted). There is not much in the area that I could find in the short time I had available. Croke Park itself is directly across the road and I would think that the area could be quite noisy on 'match day'.
Overall it is a great hotel and I would recommend it to anyone going to Dublin if you are willing to walk a bit to get public transport.",5,2021,09,11
211,Been here before and will be back,"I've been to the croke park hotel on many an occasion for matches etc. and always enjoyed my stay. With restrictions lifting I thought I'd go back for a night and I got the same excellent level of service I always have.

211,Poor food quality.,"I was here for my hotel quarantine. The experience is horrible. They maintain poor food quality and need make complain again and again. Always served ice cold food with moisture on lids , so the potato dishes always on water. Doesn’t feel the food are fresh and the soup with the lunch time feels watery..! Breakfast bread is burned and the cheese and egg omlete came with moisture water..! I complaint at 10AM and they send another portion at 12pm that’s was my breakfast..!! I am Not recommend this hotel for quarantine or any other purpose. Simple wasting money for quarantine  and get worst experience.",1,2021,06,12
211,Service is not good enough,Just one word try to avoid this hotel.  food is not good and service is horrible.......even tv just you can connect with your phone than you can use YouTube.just bad experience.....I just came from hotel quarantine but just I forgot to mention that any hotel except croke park hotel ad my friends told me who already spent 12 nights in this hotel.,1,2021,06,02
211,Excelent,"Highly recommended for both business trip and vacation
Staff unique and food superb. Not  overpriced and good wine at  value for money, unlike man hotels. Great nights sleep no noise and beds top quality and cleanliness superb. Proximity to the city a huge advantage

Above all the staff are terrific and look after your every need. The nearest thing to staying with close family as one can get. . ",5,2021,03,28
211,Cash before Delivery,They took payment from my credit card straight away at  check in  never informed me they were going to do that as i wanted to pay with a different card on check out. said they could refund it but after 10 days... Girl at reception was rude saying that she didn't take it.... also never informed there was no housekeeping.. so if i had a complaint they already had my payment..,2,2021,01,25

Rooms are a great six and are always on point and spotless. Staff are so friendly and accommodating.

211,Very comfortable stay in a modern hotel central to the city,I stayed in the hotel for approximately three days and during this time staff were very accommodating to our needs as guests.  From the safety protocols and ensuring that gym equipment was sanitized to ensuring that we had all items we needed in the room to having healthy and tasty food options. Really enjoyed the comfort of the room as I needed a quiet space to relax.    Would recommend to fellow travelers.,5,2020,12,14
211,Night away in Dublin Hotel,"This is a great location , the hotel is walking distance to the city center. All the staff were so nice, which made the stay so enjoyable. The sideline bar is a large bar / dining area that has a great atmosphere. Having car parking as part of the package is also very helpful. We will definitely be back and would have no hesitation recommending the hotel.",5,2020,12,08
211,"Friendly staff, excellent hotel","Best 4 star hotel in the city, no question. The rooms are modern and clean, the general hotel is well maintained has fantastic décor and is constantly updated.

The employee was very helpful and, after I asked how early I could check in as I needed a place to work, she arranged for me to check in within the hour. Getting to the hotel, the receptionist was so pleasant and willing to help. Ordered room service for dinner and, again, the server was very pleasant and helpful. The room is great, internet speed is very impressive for a hotel,  decent sized TV, cleanliness cannot be faulted but it is the staff that truly make the difference here. Cannot recommend highly enough.",5,2020,11,20

The staff are extremely professional and welcoming.  With 2 large double beds, the family room was spacious and clean.  Small ice bucket in the room and an ice machine down the hall means that we cant wait to come back again minus the kids!  Would absolutely recommend this hotel for a visit with our without the kids.

211,Best you can get for little money,Lovely hotel. Excellent service in bar and restaurant. Clean bedroom with great bathroom. Room service great also.

211,Lovely hotel,"Lovely, safe to stay and clean hotel. Got a warm welcome on our arrival. Had a great breakfast, all the family enjoyed it. Room was very clean, cosy and met all the safety standards. Very friendly staff.",5,2020,08,19
211,⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ Best hotel experience I’ve ever had,"Had an absolutely lovely stay with my cousin. The staff could not have been nicer if they tried. The room was perfect and spotlessly clean. We were delighted with the large flatscreen smart TV, meaning we could watch Netflix, YouTube or connect it to our phone! We had a pleasant check-in and check-out with a lovely receptionist. 

We were joined by my mum that evening in the bar and we couldn’t have received better service. We had the entire bar to ourselves, as the hotel must have been rather quiet that evening, but we weren’t made to feel like an inconvenience at all. The food was absolutely delicious and I will certainly make a point of returning to eat there again in future. 

The wonderful barman and waiter, Luke, ensured we had the best experience possible. He knew the menu inside out and is clearly very skilled behind the bar. The only way I can fairly describe Luke, is as an asset to the company. Outstanding people skills, intelligent young man, brilliant at his job, we couldn’t have asked for better. I sincerely hope he gets the appreciation he deserves because people like that are few and far between in the hospitality industry! 

Breakfast at the hotel was nothing short of perfection. We were ensured we could order as much as we wanted from the menu, the new table-service, in place of the buffet, was amazing. The lovely waitresses were so kind and brought us everything we asked for without delay. I even had the opportunity to speak French with one of the waitresses who is originally from Paris. My French definitely could do with some practice but she was very kind and patient with me.

211,Perfect Evening ,"Great stay in a fabulous hotel. Staff were so friendly and helpful and dinner and drinks were exceptional, especially the cocktails. Thomas on reception was very welcoming and accommodating assuring we were taken care of making the stay that little bit better. 

Can’t wait to return again soon to enjoy all the hotel offers. ",5,2020,08,15
211,Love this hotel can’t wait to be back again.,This was our 3rd visit to the Croke Park  Hotel . Looking forward to our 4th. From before  you arrive all your needs are catered for . We booked a family room for 4 which on the website showed as 2 double beds . As this room didn’t suit l emailed to ask for a double and 2 singles within an hour l had a reponse saying we could have a room with 2 doubles and a single. The room were spacious and spotlessly clean. We also received a Covid pack at reception with hand wipes and a face mask .The hotel booked our Croke Park Stadium Tour . Hotel staff were very friendly and welcoming . Lots of good hints and advice on where to go and what to do . Food was amazing both breakfast and dinner. Next level in hospitality couldn’t recommend it enough .,5,2020,08,14
211,Family trip,Lovely hotel. Good location. Very good precautions re Covid. The staff were the highlight of the trip. They couldn’t have done more for us. Breakfast was fantastic! Family room was a bit tight for 4 people but it was clean and comfortable. Would stay again! ,4,2020,08,12
211,Outstanding,"Stayed here because I was sitting an exam in Dublin. My whole experience here was first class - from the moment I stepped in to checking out. The staff are so friendly. Room was SPOTLESS and the food was delicious, the best food I have had in a long time.

The staff here are a team, and have really pulled out all the stops to run the hotel in the middle of the pandemic. The place was so clean, sanitiser everywhere, social distancing in place, and even a complimentary bag with a mask and wipes upon check-in. 

Also - my bed was huge and so comfortable, massive television with chrome cast, air conditioning, fridge, safe, complimentary waters, a bath and separate shower.

Thank you so much to the dream team at The Croke Park for making my stay so comfortable. I will 100% be back, and am recommending you to all my friends and family. 

- Rianne",5,2020,08,11
211,Will keep coming back,"Spent yet another night in this excellent hotel on Sunday 2nd August.  Our first hotel outing after lockdown. Its really sad to see this great hotel so quiet with only one floor open I think.
Got checked in early as usual and would not hesitate to stay here again.
All aspects of Covid protection were evident, presented with a pack with masks and wipes at checkin and witnessed the exceptional sanitation of tables in the sideline bar after customers left their table.
Feel really sorry for the staff as they try to both be polite and helpful and keep their distance at the same time.  It can be hard to understand them with the visors they wear, but this is not their fault and they do try very hard.
I would return here again without hesitation and would encourage others to do the same and do hope the GAA get something going again across the road so that this hotel can show again how efficent they can be, even on big match days.
Thank you very much for another enjoyable stay and we hope to return soon.",5,2020,08,11

211,Lovely hotel,Myself and my husband enjoyed a 1 night stay here on his birthday. Hotel was really nice. We received a drinks voucher on arrival which entitled us to a free drink each. We also had the use of a very comfortable residents only lounge which was so comfy. Also free fruit and pastries the next morning. Thought the little touches in our room at night was really nice like chocolates on the bed. Curtains drawn. Slippers by the bed. These things are appreciated. Wil definitely return.,4,2020,03,09

Highly recommend the hotel and bar for Dublin stays.",5,2020,03,01
211,"A nice hotel, perfectly located for Croke Park","I recently stayed here as I was speaking at a conference in Croke Park the following day, and I was very impressed with the hotel.  As well as being ideally located (across the road from the stadium), the hotel was clean and comfortable and the staff all very friendly and helpful.  The television in the bedroom was bigger than the one in my living room, and had all the main sports channels (including Sky Sports) - possibly for all the sports fans coming to matches.",4,2020,03,01
211,Nice Place in Dublin,"This hotel was a nice place right next to the stadium. The staff was nice and the food was good. The staff even packed breakfast to go as we had to fly out before the breakfast opened for the day. Now to the room, the view was not great as it overlooked a wash with graffiti all over it. The beds were comfortable enough but they were a bit small and for some reason the rolled; we assumed this was so you could push the beds together. I believe the bathroom was the best part of the room. We were very happy because the staff helped us celebrate our anniversary with some little treats and some champagne. Overall, it was a nice place within walking distance of the heart of Dublin (25 minutes to Trinity College) and only a 17 minutes drive from the airport.",4,2020,02,26
211,Very nice hotel,"We rented a king room. It was very nice, and clean with a comfortable bed. The location of the hotel is good but a little further from downtown than I had expected. Having been warned about driving in the city we opted for  catching an Uber. (Walking is possible, however our friends who are locals advised against late night walking.) 
Our only complaint was ongoing issues with the heat in the room. ",4,2020,02,25
211,Beautiful hotel,Really nice hotel so handy for match days. Lovely room and all little touches like champagne an executive lounge free teas coffee hot chocolate and more really made it a special stay.

211,"Nice hotel, Great staff",We went to Dublin for a trip with another couple. We only stayed for five nights but the staff was wonderful. We had the pleasure of be served by Kent in the bar.

Will definitely be recommending this hotel.,5,2020,02,23
211,Great hotel and good wheelchair accessible features,Staff could not have been nicer and nothing was too much trouble for them.  We stayed in a wheelchair accessible room and it met our expectations.  Only issue was that beds did not have lockable castors.,5,2020,02,17
211,Excellent hotel!,"The Croke Park hotel is a really nice hotel! I was there some days in June 2017. The atmosphere is good, the staff is so kind and everything in my room was perfect and clean. The food was delicious. It is opposite the croke park stadium.",5,2020,02,17

211,One of the best all round hotels I've stayed in,"My wife, 1 year old daughter and I came to Dublin for a long weekend and couldn't have picked a better hotel to stay in. 

HOTEL
The hotel itself if clean, warm and has a nice atmosphere. Nice reception area leading to the restaurant / bar which had ample space. Food was nice (menu could be a bit better) and could watch the sport on their big screens. Our room was very large and great for our little one to roam around. Sky sports in our room was also a treat, although my wife would disagree! Nice touches like fresh bottled water supplied daily was a plus. The bed was also comfy. Only downside was the pillows. The feathered ones went to nothing so asked for their alternative - a synthetic type, which suited us better, but still wasn't brilliant. 

STAFF
Couldn't get better staff if they tried. Everyone was friendly and helpful. Having a baby can sometimes be a bit manic and they helped in every way possible. Their training has been excellent. A big shout out to the general manager who got us in the Executive room to watch the six nations match as the Gaelic footy was on the main tv. Also the Daniel and Hudaifa (sorry if I spelt it wrong - not written down well!) in the bar area. Great service and attention the detail.

LOCATION
About a 15/20min walk to the centre, which means it is in a quiet area. Walked in every day, so for us it was ideal. Not far from the airport. The right side of the City.

All in all it",5,2020,02,12
211,Great Spot to stay,We recently stayed at the Croke Park Hotel - cannot fault it - lovely room great breakfast. Very central a 10 minute walk brought us to the top of O'Connell Street - lovely girl at Reception - we'll stay again!,4,2020,02,12

211,Close enough to the city centre for exploring it but far enough away to be quet at night,"A very comfortable bar & restaurant with excellent big screens for watching any sports, the staff were very pleasant & the hotel itself was very clean.

211,Top class hotel,I stayed for business recently. Its my favourite place to stay in Dublin no matter what I'm in town for. The location isn't the most convenient but the professionalism of staff and the luxury and quality of the stay here more than makes us for location. ,5,2020,02,07
211,Great stay,Stayed here and did the croke park tour very handy to just walk over to the next morning was a nice pleasant stay with a few minor issues but all was quickly resolved and staff were very friendly  cant fault them,4,2020,02,04

Staff seemed a little stressed at breakfast and after it was difficult to get a coffee. Otherwise no complaints",4,2020,02,03
211,Work trip to Dublin,"The Croke Park is a lively hotel with nice rooms, bar and food. Check in was prompt, however  check out was very slow. Only problem I had with my stay was the cleaners were slamming doors repeatedly from about 630am near my room. For such a nice hotel I would expect much better. ",4,2020,01,31

211,The best of all worlds ,"This hotel has all the modern conveniences that are expected nowadays such as wifi, great beds, gym, good choice of food and drink, with easy access to many of Dublin's top attractions (lying in the shadow of one of the best at Croke Park Stadium and Museum!). All those features should get top marks - quality / cleanliness / etc. What is difficult to describe fully is the quality of the welcome and the friendly, helpful attitude all of the staff bring to their work. Cannot praise them enough for their excellence- many thanks for making our stay so enjoyable. 

So if you're looking for a modern hotel with the type of welcome Ireland is famous for - this is the place for you. ",5,2020,01,27

211,Croke park tour,"The tour was very nice and we got to see all the ins and outs of the stadium. The lady giving the tour was so sweet and was very informative. We got to see things like dressing rooms, practice areas for the athletes, and private box rooms. I definitely recommend doing this tour. The interactive museum was fun as well.",5,2020,01,21
211,Lovely comfortable hotel,Stayed here for the past 4 years . Staff are friendly/ room is gorgeous and so comfortable! Pillow top mattress is amazing ! I love staying here . Breakfast never disappoints!! I look forward to my next stay,5,2020,01,20
211,Lovely modern hotel but really lacking in service,"I stayed at the hotel recently as my local GAA club were in the Club All Ireland Finals
The hotel was busy but i'd imagine not as busy as they would be on normal All Ireland Final day
The hotel is in a great location and the rooms are very clean/comfortable and have a nice modern feel to them
Check in was very easy and the lady on reception made things very easy.
We went to the restaurant to get something to eat before the match, seated quick enough but waited over 45 minutes for 4 bowls of soup. The soup itself wasn't great and had no flavor to it. Repeatedly asked for water, glasses on the table were dirty. I didn't say anything as I put it down to them being busy.
When we returned from the match, we went to the bar and were told we weren't allowed to order any sandwiches ect from the menu as on match day they don't serve them. I asked for some crisps and I was advised they didn't have any nor did they have any in stock despite having a hotel full of people. 
At reception, I asked if I could get some tea and milk for the room as there wasn't any on arrival - 1.5 hours later and I had to ring back down to the room and ask again.
I went to freshen up and my room key wouldn't work so I had to go back to reception to have this fixed - throughout the night this happened 3 times to both my room key and my 70+ year old parents amongst others staying in the hotel.
Breakfast was extremely disappointing to say the least - I asked for a table for 4 people and they waitress sat us at such a small table we couldn't fit more than 2 plates so had to move. The jugs of juices were empty, no eggs, no bowls for cereal/yogurt despite asking several times. Tea/Toast arrived cold and I mean cold which isn't good enough. 
Nice hotel and you would feel sorry for some of the waiters/waitresses as one can only assume they are dealing with a lot of complaints. 
Overall, my experience of this hotel is not a good one and I would be reluctant to return.",3,2020,01,20
211,Constant good quality,Stayed here several times for business. Never had any complained. Very comfortable and fresh/clean look and feel. Friendly staff. Location is a bit away from centre (around 20 minute walk) right opposite of Croke Park stadium.,5,2020,01,17
211,Super staff!,"Checked in here last minute! 
Luke at the reception was so lovely on check in! 
The room was really nice, large and a beautiful bathroom with a bath and shower! 
It was absolutely spotless and classy! 
Very large and comfy executive lounge. 
The dinner was really nice and tasty, the ladies serving us were so nice and kind.

Would absolute recommend this hotel it's so modern yet homely.  ",5,2020,01,12
211,Very friendly and efficient staff,"We had a great night in the hotel bar! It’s a lovely big comfortable bar, with table service and a massive thanks to Dylan, Ian, Kent, Luke and Jamie for being great hosts, they were so friendly and welcoming! We will definitely be returning :)",5,2020,01,11
211,"After my 5th stay, progressively getting worst, 5th time visiting was the worst...","1. Great location if you have a car (free parking for hotel guests) and want to talk to city centre
2. Gym - Decent but progressively worst since the first time I went. There was no water so tried to call reception. Reception was busy so didn't manage to get water on day 2, came back day 3 and still no water so called reception and it was then refilled
3. Breakfast - The quality of breakfast vs the hotels I've stayed at in Dublin is bottom 10%. Ie. fruit selection limited, cheese selection limited etc. I would recommend getting continental breakfast and ordering from al la carte if you want to enjoy breakfast a bit more. Its rather costly at €12 for continental plus €10.50 extra for eggs royale but I prefer it over sausage, bacon fried eggs etc (which is €14 if purchased during check-in) if you prefer.
4. Rooms are nice enough although toilet flush wasn't great so left flushing multiple times
5. Bar staff are lovely, felt the same every visit which helped pull up my review score

Additional detailed account of why I haven't given this hotel a higher score which left me sorely disappointed with Croke Park on this occasion:
During check-in I was asked if I would like to add breakfast for the next 2 mornings for €14 per day. I asked if there was à la carte and was advised that it is buffet. I accepted this as the only option and paid €14 per day. Upon arrival to breakfast the next morning I noticed there were options to purchase additional items. I did not take this option up and tried the hot breakfast as this was included. I was quite disappointed with the hot breakfast in comparison to the first time I stayed as I was able to order from the menu previously which was a nicer experience. I've stayed in Dublin ~25 times over the last 2 years and I found the hot breakfast at Croke Park as one of the least favourites. The next morning I went to breakfast and advised Mary Kat (who seating customers) that I felt I was slightly misinformed at reception regarding my breakfast options and that I would like to pay the difference to get a breakfast I would prefer, ie. €12 for continental plus €10.50 for the additional charge for eggs royale taking it up to €22.50 as oppose to €24.50 which I would be charged for a hot breakfast that I would not be eating. I was extremely clear in stating I understood that I would need to pay for one of the initial charges (ie. continental or full) plus the additional charge by describing in numbers but Mary Kat went on to explain to me 3 times that I had paid for full breakfast including hot food (at €14) but can pay the additional €10.50 to get the eggs royale. I stated this leaves me being charged an extra €2 after I felt I was misinformed. I said honestly, I've had great experience staying here previously, I really like the hotel and I am not struggling for the €2 but down to principle alone, I would like the hotel to do the right thing by addressing this issue. Mary Kat then seated us, took our order and said she needed to speak to her team lead. Tanya came to see us approximately 8 minutes later and went on to explain that we needed to pay the additional fees with complete disregard for anything we have stated previously to Mary Kat. I went on to explain exactly what I stated to Mary Kat regarding what we were advised at reception, the difference in cost, the fact we did understand the charge model and that I didn't really want anything but the hotel to do what I felt was the right thing. Tanya responded that she will check if we can receive €2 credit (I assume credit is with the hotel as oppose to credit refund) with reception rather than just either 1) state it will be resolved and no further action was required 2) discount the charge by €2 so that we were not left with an additional charge. I stated that if it was this much hassle to make it right then I would be better off paying the €2 each. Tanya then went on to take our order again and asked if we confirmed if we were happy to pay €10.50. I stated yes, its fine. Our order then came late as it seems after we ordered from Mary Kat the order did not go into the kitchen and then when it came out it was overcooked. I advised a waiter that our eggs were overcooked and at this point our food came out after ~22-25 minutes (from initial order time) and we were running late to work by 15 minutes so I left it as that. I've got a photo of this as this ordeal left me vex and pretty exhausted by how a small issue managed to go on and escalate from a happy returning customer to an extremely disappointed. Me and my colleague were both shocked at a demonstration on poor customer service on so many levels.

I got to work 15 minutes late which didn't help my day.",3,2020,01,10
211,"Amazing staff, beautiful hotel",We chose this hotel to gather for the afters of my fathers funeral. Every single staff member were so kind and friendly and could not have done more to help us.

211,Unexpected visit during busy time ,"We googled the place, and showed up to have a few drinks in a quiet atmosphere, in New year's eve, everything in town was packed, we got fabulous cocktails, hotel looks like they are missing a star, should be marked at least one star up, and service was amazing, two very nice receptionists welcomed us, and we were served by a gentleman named Thomas in a bar, 5 star service and complimentary chocolate! They know how to care about guests. Lovely evening ",5,2019,12,31
211,"Convenient, easy access great parking and transport options to the city","We had a lovely stay at the Croke park hotel. easy access to the city and not far from coastal walk along the seafront in Clontarf, whether you want to experience city life or the great outdoors in Dublin this is a top hotel choice.",5,2019,12,26
211,GAA Package,"We booked the GAA package that include a stay for a family of 4, 3 course meal, breakfast and tickets for the GAA Stadium tour.  We had tickets booked for the Gaiety panto and decide to stay in The Croke Park hotel.  The staff were brilliant from reception to dining staff and made feel so welcome.  They even included a drink on the house for all.  Nothing was a problem and staff so polite and friendly.  The Stadium tour was excellent and so interesting and the hotel also let us keep the car in their car park until we finished out tour.  Will definitely be back.",5,2019,12,23
211,Birthday Visit,"We stayed here for my husband's birthday. What a lovely hotel. The beds are a DREAM! Upon my request, they assisted in delivering a birthday treat to our room as a surprise for him. Much appreciated! Clean, warm and welcoming, and the scent of that hotel is incredible. You'll know what I mean when you get there. Plenty of things to do close by and easy to get a taxi. The male staff members were incredible, with the exception of the woman working the front desk on the 21st and 22nd of December. She made it clear you were inconveniencing her any time you approached her. Seemed confused at times as well. Gave us wrong directions to navigate the hotel, which was a bit alarming, given she works there. She was the only female I saw on staff for front desk those two days. Thankfully, everyone else was SO wonderful, willing to help and made us feel very welcome. Would definitely stay here again.",5,2019,12,22
211,Very Happy,Our stay here was very satisfactory. Kent our server in the restaurant was an absolute gent and really enhanced our stay. Our father is unwell in hospital and he really went out of his way to make us feel comfortable and well looked after. ,5,2019,12,19
211,A great hotel ,"Could not fault the Croke Park Hotel. Friendly staff, great facilities, good food, superb breakfast.
Close to Drumcondra railway station good access to central Dublin, but far enough away to be peaceful and quiet.",5,2019,12,18
211,Amazing Hotel and Customer Service,"From our parking, to checking in, to our room, to dinner, to extra supplies, to breakfast, to our check out you guys were amazing.  We honestly felt like we were the only guest in the hotel.

Luke on reception made our checking in and out so easy and so friendly.  He is a true assist to your company.
The food for dinner was amazing, your waitress, I am sorry I didn’t get her name is from Northern Italy and was in Incredible with her attention to detail.  When we were seated she took our 11 year old daughter to a separate table and taught her how to fold cloth napkins in a different way.  My daughter is very imaginative and loves stuff like this and was simple blown away. 
We are certainly a family of 5 fussy eaters.
Your waitress wrote down every order, repeated it back to us and delivered everything we asked for.  This is a credit to your kitchen team as well, as everything came out as we asked. From sauces on the side, to steaks cooked perfect, to dishes being altered to suit us.

Upon leaving the restaurant my children had used all the tea, milk, hot chocolate in the room and asked for more from reception. We only got to our room 316 and a young lady was there with handfuls of items, thank you.

The room was well sized, comfortable, we even cast a movie from our phone to the tv and and had family movie night after being stuffed with dinner.

Breakfast in the morning was simply lovely with great attention to toast and tea, fresh hot lovely food.",5,2019,12,13
211,December stay at the Croke Park,"Lovely stay in the Croke ark Hotel.

I stayed the first night with work colleagues for our Christmas Party and we had a brilliant night with amazing food. Our triple room was spacious and the beds really comfortable.

The second night my partner came up and we had a double room.  Again the room was so nice, the beds were so comfortable!
The staff were so lovely and helpful and a real credit to the hotel.

We would definitely recommend this for a stay in Dublin.  Gorgeous hotel, so close so everything.
It was so christmasy and festive with gorgeous decorations and tress.",5,2019,12,13
211,Great business related visit to Croke Park hotel,"Stayed 3 nights in this hotel as I had business appointments nearby.  Very comfy bed and full bathroom with bath and walk-in shower.  Breakfast and dinner very good.
Great underground complimentary parking was a welcome bonus.
Will definitely return in the future.",5,2019,12,11
211,good value,"The location is a taxi drive away from the city center, its a 30 minutes walk to downtown so you most probably want to take a cab (the most accomodating staff will arrange it for you). however the hop-on-hop-off city tour busses stop by the crow park nearby. rooms are very nicely kept and everything is very much up to standard. the best part is the restaurant and bar. good food, nice athmosphere and a very wide selection of beverages (14 kinds of beer on tap!). breakfust buffe is average",4,2019,12,11
211,3 nights in dublin,"Spend 3 nights here with the mrs.
In short , nothing short of amazing.
From the time we reached (mr krishna) was nothin short of amazing. Helping us from our rental car the day we landed till sorting our taxi the day we left.
But its not just 1 person, the entire staff was pleasant and more then helpful. The attention to details (especially the wine and butlers chocolates) was great. 
Rooms are big, bathroom is squeaky clean, however as per all the hotels in ireland , i felt the rooms are rather dimly lit.
If you are planning to travel in dublin by foot then be prepared for at least a 15mins walk each way to reach the city center.
P.s - the bar is also a highlight",5,2019,12,11
211,Very pleasant Hotel sooo convenient.,"From the wonderful warm welcome at reception to my departure everyone I met was so pleasant and helpful.The rooms were very clean and the shower powerful!
Breakfast was fantastic.
Will definitely stay again and highly recommend the Croke Park Hotel.  ",5,2019,12,10
211,Wonderful Experience,"We went to the 'Hawthorn' for a Christmas Dinner and absolutely loved every meal they served us from prosecco to our desserts. The hotel itself was amazing. the second you enter you'll be able to feel Christmas vibes. The staff from reception were all so kind and ready to help you even if their so busy. But what made our night was from the service of Kimberly and Patricia,they were so kind,friendly and attentive. They look after your needs and made sure everything was okay and perfectly served. Thank you for your service,this won't be the last and next time I'll stay in this hotel and will recommend it to everyone!!!",5,2019,12,09
211,Outstanding,"I stayed here at the end of November and just loved this hotel. The staff were amazing and couldn't be more helpful. The rooms were a nice size and very comfortable. It had all the facilities needed for a good stay.  The service throughout the hotel was very good. 
I had access to the Exectuve Lounge which was amazing and highly recommended as an add-on.
The location was good however not totally central.  If you are happy to walk a bit, it is fine otherwise you will need to get a taxi to go shopping etc. 
I would definately stay here again.",5,2019,12,09
211,Croker,Lovely hotel very clean great staff very near the city centre and Croke park car parking very good scenery from some of the rooms fantastic I couldn't have expected or asked for more I will go back there again,5,2019,12,09
211,Think this is visit 8 here.. ,"Been quite a few times to The Croke Park and simply because we love it. Checked in by a pleasant young man called Luke. 
We were in room 434 this time with access to executive lounge which we love popping into for a coffee and view of stadium.
Room was lovely as always with big cosy bed.
Mary Kate was star of the show at breakfast on this visit. Smiling and very helpful. Nothing was a bother to her. Thank you Mary Kate.
Was great to see Sean the duty manager who also was very helpful and welcoming.

Walk into Dublin is not that fat about 15"" minutes. Taxi home at night was 9 euros.

Thanks to Alan and his team for another lovely stay. See you next year. ",5,2019,12,08
211,Fabulous Hotel,"I recently attended a 2 day training course in the Croke Park Hotel, and I have to say I was very impressed. It's a beautiful hotel, and the staff were exceptional. The lad that was looking after us (Brendan, Trainee) went above a beyond to ensure we had everything we needed, he was so helpful and his customer service skills were impeccable,  the girls in the restaurant looked after us very well at lunch time and on finishing the course we decided to go in the bar, and Jamie was so attentive, he didn't have the wine that my friend wanted however he recommended another and he really knew his stuff, needless to say she enjoyed it that much she had another glass.
I will definitely be back again. So very well done Brendan, Jamie and the girls in the restaurant you did am amazing job.

211,Croke Park Hotel - pleasantly surprised,"Had a two night stay in Croke Park Hotel @ start of December - had passed it many times going to a match and was very pleasantly surprised at how impressive the hotel is, both in appearance and service.

Very pleased with our stay",5,2019,12,06

The breakfast is the best I've ever had in a hotel, with a great variety of choices, and the service is very fast and friendly. Especially Doris, she makes you feel at home and very well taken care of, with her professional but warm and positive approach.
Thank you, everyone at Croke Park hotel for making our stay in Dublin great.",5,2019,12,01
211,"Dinner and Drinks at Sideline Bar, server Kent.","An excellent experience at the Sideline Bar, pints and Shepard's Pie! Kent was our server, great service and conversation, making for a delightful experience we will not forget. Engaging and genuine. We will certainly be returning!",5,2019,11,29
211,Fantastic restaurant staff,"My husband and I ate in the restaurant this week in the Croke Park. We were served by Kent, who was just fantastic. He recommended what to eat, what to drink with it. He was so friendly amd polite and professional. You don't get customer service like that in most hotels. I'll def be back again. Food was lovely.",5,2019,11,29
211,Great stay in a friendly city,"Me and my family was very well treated at this hotel. From the first moment we felt warmly welcomed. The room was comfortable, clean and quiet. The breakfast was a full Irish breakfast plus lots of fruit which my children enjoyed immensely. The hotel is in a quiet area within 20 minutes walk to the downtown.
Highly recommended!",5,2019,11,29
211,Great Hotel for a Dublin Stay with Car Parking,"Have stayed in this hotel many times and it never disappoints.

Yes it has on-site parking which is very handy and yes it is within 10 minutes walk of Dublin City Centre but its the professionalism of the staff from the moment you arrive at reception to check-in, or eat in the restaurant or drink at the bar that really sets this hotel apart.
They are welcoming and engaging at every interaction.

The rooms are spotlessly clean and modern

The food in the restaurant is excellent and the choices available for the buffet breakfast is very good.

If you are planning a visit to explore Dublin city then this is the spot for you",5,2019,11,25
211,Fabulous Hotel,"Recently spent two days on a training course in the Croke Park Hotel.  What a gorgeous hotel very luxurious.
The staff were so helpful and friendly in particular the waiter Brendan.  Nothing was too much trouble for him and he was so friendly and efficient.  He was working on his own and seemed quite busy and he did so with a friendly smile lovely young man.
We stayed for a drink in the bar on the last day and the barman Jamie was also very friendly and helpful.
Would definitely recommend this hotel",5,2019,11,25
211,Croke Park wins in Dublin!,"Easy access from car park to reception to a friendly, efficient registration. The room was extremely clean and comfortable. The pillows were luxurious. the staff were extremely helpful and efficient. Evening meal and breakfast was good. Check-out was easy. I was allowed to leave my car while away on business for a day. Hotel within 10-15 mins walk to City Centre, faster than bus or taxi. I would highly recommend the Croke Park Hotel. ",5,2019,11,24
211,Excelent Stay,"The hotel has great facilities and the staff were really nice and friendly. The room was very spacious, the bed was super confortable and the bathroom had a great shower and tub. Overall it was an excelent stay!",5,2019,11,24
211,Convenient Location to downtown Dublin,"I have stayed at this hotel on several occasions- each time the reception has been able to find me a room immediately after my Trans-Atlantic flight. The rooms are very comfortable and clean. It is convenient to the airport and it is a 20-minute walk to O’Connell Street, the main drag, north of the River Liffey.  ",5,2019,11,23
211,Excellent Service,"Service  was absolutely Brilliant. Hannah in reception was so kind and helpful when we arrived and through out our stay. We had to cut our stay short due to circumstances outside our control. As we had booked through Hotels.com website, they needed to contact the hotel for a refund. All was sorted in two phone calls. Again I put this down to Hannah's brilliant customer service. The representative from Hotels.com was brilliant too in that matter. Hannah is excellent at her job. Brilliant !!!  Tim & Ana",5,2019,11,22
211,"The Croke Park; luxury, comfort, the friendliest staff ever.","My husband and I loved our stay at the The Croke Park, Dublin.  The minute we arrived, tired and wrinkled, the staff there treated us like family.  Mehou (I hope I have the spelling right,) and Stephen were especially helpful to us as we got settled and they always greated us with a smile when we showed up for a drink at the bar or a meal.  The food was excellent. You can sit in the sports bar area, by the fireplace, or in the dinning room.  For a real romantic meal, eat on the enclosed patio with candles, strings of lights and winding ivy.  The concierge was cheery and full of great ideas for us. The rooms were nice and the beds were some of the most comfortable we've ever stayed in. Don't miss that breakfast either!  We sincerely hope to go back someday.",5,2019,11,20
211,"Great hotel, friendly staff and good location.",Stayed at the hotel recently and found the hotel staff to be extremely friendly and efficient. The rooms and facilities were excellent. The hotel is located within walking distance of the city centre too. The only problem I encountered was that I found the breakfast and evening meal were a bit cold and some items had run out at breakfast time and took a while to replace. ,4,2019,11,18
211,Good stay,It's a fine hotel. the rooms are spacious and very clean. Staff is friendly and will give you a warm welcome. I use it for work trips and find the free shuttle bus to Eastpoint Business Park very convenient. To be able to use this free service twice in the morning and once in the evening is a great way to save company money.,4,2019,11,17
211,A Gem Tucked Away...,"I recently visited Dublin on a weekend trip with my husband, and I chose Croke Park based on a number of factors, including online ratings and reviews. I’m also drawn to nicely decorated boutique hotels, and I was enamored with the photos I saw online. 

Overall, it was a lovely stay. I’ll start with the positive:

- The hotel staff were TOP NOTCH. We booked two nights separately in two different room types, and on both occasions, they brought the room keys to wherever were in the hotel. Are you kidding me?? So unexpected, so amazing. I truly appreciate the accommodating staff who answered all our questions and helped us called taxis when needed. Overall, they hotel staff rose to any and every challenge/request with a smile. 

- The room itself was nicely decorated and clean. Although our first room, the hot water didn’t get very hot. We didn’t even get a chance to lodge the complaint because we got another room the next day. 

- The restaurant decor/environment - exquisite! Truly “Insta-worthy” if you’re into that sort of thing. The food at the Sideline Bar is also delicious. We ate there twice and both times, everything was very tasty. The strawberry mojito needs a little work though :) 

But, of course, there’s always some downsides. And while, Croke Park had a few, it really didn’t take away from the experience:

- The buffet breakfast in the Bistro was TERRIBLE! Gross eggs. Rubbery bacon. The list goes on. We were glad we didn’t pay for it with the room. The breakfast in the Sideline Bar area particularly the omelette, more than made up for it the next day. 

- Location - Croke Park is in an industrial looking area that’s slightly away from the city Centre. Theres not a lot of food options within walking distance if you’re looking to walk. There’s no good views from this hotel, so don’t go looking for it. But, the plus is that everything important from the train station to the city center is a 5 minute drive away. If you’re feeling adventurous, the city Centre is a 20 minute walk and well worth it. 

Overall, it was an excellent experience. It wasn’t perfect, but what is? I would definitely stay again and recommend to others. Just work on the buffet breakfast guys. Put as much love into it as you do everything else!",5,2019,11,15
211,Wonderfully service,"Myself and my boyfriends decided to stay in the croke park for our anniversary and it is one of the best decisions I’ve ever made. As it was heavily raining on the Saturday we decided to stay in the bar for food and we were not disappointed. Special mention to the bartenders Ciara and Jamie, they were incredibly accommodating and professional, as well as Kent our server who made sure that we were looked after for the entire night. 10/10 would book again",3,2019,11,13
211,Brilliant bar staff!!,"Jamie, Lorraine and ciara  behind the bar could not do enough for us, between the  cocktails and the attentive service I could not reccomend more, excellent stuff!! Honestly cannot get over how spoilt we were",5,2019,11,13
211,"Focus on the money, not the client","Noisy bedroom with no isolation from the road in front. Heating malfunction even after changing bedroom. Only solution was to install a radiator in the room.

Issue with my credit card's chip. So they didn't allow to check-in until I went out to find a cash machine and withdraw the money. No focus on the client.",2,2019,11,12
211,J-con guest,"I was invited to stay here as a special guest at J-con.

We have decided to visit the bar on a few occasions and I was extreemly impressed with the service.  I wanted a Disaronno sour cocktail but it wasn't on the menu until I happened to talk to Jamie. They were extreemly accommodating and I cannot stress how well mannered and bubbly they are all.  Shout out to Jamie for making the best disaronno sours of my life!

And I HAVE TO mention this waiter : Kent! Bright Young fella, extreemly friendly guy and definitely a pleasure to meet!

Overall the hotel couldn't be anymore accommodating.  It was clean, friendly and very cozy.  I couldn't fault them for anything.  I would also like to mention that we had checked out then we realised that we needed to stay another night and they arranged it right away.

Would 100% stay here again.
Thank you for everything.",5,2019,11,09
211,Such a family friendly hotel.,"Just had another (3rd this year) visit to The Croke park hotel. This hotel is perfect for seeing all the sights the city has to offer, and is also perfect for families. The staff cannot do enough especially for the kids. One lady in particular,Lorraine, couldn’t do enough to make sure we had everything we needed to make our stay as relaxing and stress free and enjoyable as possible. The concierge is also a wealth of knowledge about different sightseeing and tourist attractions and will give discount cards where applicable. Will definitely be back to stay. Oh and the breakfasts are amazing!!",5,2019,11,09
211,Convenient but still out of city,"Staff very obliging and cheerful.Clean and fresh surroundings.Great selection at breakfast but could be a bit hotter.
Quick check in and check out .Great to be able to leave bags in .easy access to city centre and conference centre across the road.",4,2019,11,08
211,Excellent service and food,"Our stay was short, but very enjoyable.  the food in the Sideline Bar was gorgeous and our waiter, Kent, went above and beyond the call of duty to make it an enjoyable meal.  Room was lovely and beds very comfortable.",5,2019,11,07
211,Wonderful Hotel Thank You Katie Noonan,"Having had our booking canceled by AMOMA after they went into liquidation, the CROKE Park Hotel and staff came to our rescue and ensured we were accommodated for the Dublin city marathon 2019 weekend . Thank You Katie & Staff. We had a great stay, room was great and very comfortable. Food in the hotel was to a high standard and the reception staff were excellent a dealing with any requests we had. Free parking was a bonus and the breakfast was really great. Thank You so much. ",5,2019,11,07

211,Smooth Stay,"We stayed in this property for 3 nights and we are reasonably satisfied. The location seem to be a hindrance as the Property is little far from the City Center and Public Transport in Dublin is not very tourist friendly. Therefore most of the time we end up hiring a taxi. The breakfast provided at The Sidelines.. was ordinary & nothing much to mention. Overall it seems this place may be suitable for Business Travelers or Supporters of various games happening in Crore Park Stadium for for people travelling for pleasure its not so comfortable. The staff tried to assist nd make you comfortable, same can't be said for all staff members.",4,2019,11,07
211,Perfect end to an Irish vacation,"My wife and I spent 2 nights at the Croke at the tail end of a 1 week bus tour.

The hotel is located just on the edge of the city centre, only 7 km from the airport.

Postives:
We experienced excellent service from checkin to checkout. We had an issue with the initial room (too close to the elevator) which the staff addressed with no problem at all. 
The room we had (259) was clean, nicely appointed and comfortable.
The meals in the hotel were excellent (breakfast & dinner). Our service in the bar, Kent, was very helpful giving us suggestion on meals, a local beer to try and making sure we had everything we needed. THANKS Kent!
The fitness area is on the 1st floor. Nice size space, minimal equipment but more than enough for a ""travel workout"". Big thumbs up having all equipment in good working order - Thanks to the cleaning & maintenance staff.

Minor Concern:
The area around the hotel seems a bit ""iffy"". We had no issues walking to the Temple Bar area (less than 3k, took 25 mins) but I would do the same in the evening. 
Hallway noise - the gap under the door allowed hallway sounds to the heard in the room. We easily solved this is one of the bathroom towels.

We would stay again.

Enjoy Dublin!",4,2019,11,06
211,Excellent Hotel,"I stay here regularly and it is a fab business hotel....great location, bar, restaurant and beautiful rooms.
the staff here are amazibg and I got served again in the restaurant by Kimberly,who is so attentive and hospitable. Best urban hotel in Dublin JM",5,2019,11,06
211,Great on one hand not so on the other hand .  ,"The hotel is facing the Croke park stadium and iat reasonable walking distance from Dublin city centre. The staff at reception is just very helpful and nice!  So are the hotel maids who I believe spend quite some time slotting their cards to open the doors for guests whose room cards get constantly de-activated. 
The room was really comfy, large, with a shower and a bath tub in the bathroom. 
I hesitated between a 3 and a 4 rating for this hotel. I end up giving it a 3 as breakfast time  is the unpleasant experience. It’s messy, the staff seems unprepared, unable to cope, tables are not cleared so you end having to sit at a table where the cups and pot of the previous guests. have not been cleared yet. And because of that waiters think they have already brought you hot tea/coffee. So you end having to explain, etc not exactly how you want to start your day. 
One morning I arrived at 8:30 and the buffet was just empty : no eggs, no bacon, no mushrooms, no sausages...nothing to eat basically which meant having to wait for refill. The breakfast experience just reveals a lack of organization, a lack of training and no proper management. ",3,2019,11,06
211,Great hotel but watch out for sneaky charges in restaurant,"So all the reviews you have read about this hotel are true. The reception staff were very welcoming, the hotel is absolutely spotless, the gym facilities are great, the breakfast choices are excellent, the rooms are comfortable and even the passing trains didn't really bother me. And I slept like a baby.

But there was one thing which left a slightly bad taste in my mouth. When we went for dinner at 'The Sideline' bar we asked for fish and chips from the menu. The restaurant had run out so we were offered salmon instead. Delighted, we accepted. At the same time we ordered the burger and fries. When asked if we wanted cheese and pickle, we naturally said yes. When we got the bill we discovered the salmon cost 7.50 Euro more than the fish and chips and for the cheese and pickle on our burgers we were charged 1 Euro extra per item. Not big money but we should have been told this at the time of ordering, rather than what felt like an underhanded way to get more money from customers.

Also, the iron in my bedroom was dirty, which I did not see before using it. I only had one clean shirt and it was dirtied/stained by the iron so I had to wear a waistcoat all day to hide the dirt/stain, which was very uncomfortable as I was busy all day. 12 hours after leaving the hotel I still have my waistcoat on as I've not got home yet. 

These are both relatively small things which can be avoided. Would I stay here again? Yes, definitely.",4,2019,11,05
211,Meets requirements,"Stayed here for a couple of nights towards end of September - Well maintained hotel with decent sized rooms (we had three rooms booked, all nearly the same). Location-wise probably not the best, but it did not matter to us since we had a rented car. The hotel does offer free parking.

Overall, it met our purpose!",5,2019,11,05

211,Great hotel,"A very pleasant stay at a fantastic hotel.  By far and away the best part of the stay is the staff, the Irish do hospitality like no one else and I wasn't disappointed here.  Special mention to Sarah in the Sideline bar who really looked after us after a busy day.  Many thanks!",4,2019,11,04
211,Highly recommend  lovely hotel,"Stayed for a few days with my sisters last week, there was a mix up in the booking through no fault of the hotel.  Sean the deputy manager sorted it out and looked after us very well without a fuss. Very friendly efficient staff especially Kimberly in the bar serving the tables a real asset to the hotel. So friendly and competent, good at her job. Would definitely recommend this hotel very clean,  comfortable beds, seating areas very comfortable in bar and library.  The only down side was the drink very pricey.",5,2019,11,03
211,Friendly service generous size rooms,A modern hotel in contemporary style. A great welcome at reception. Rooms are generous with a large bathroom and separate shower and bath. TV is enormous! Breakfast was good with plenty on offer. A nice feel to the hotel. My wife did comment on the lack of plugs near to a mirror making drying hair challenging! A little bit out of town c 20 min walk or there is a good bus service less than 5 mins away.,5,2019,11,03
211,Best bartenders ever,"Bank holiday in the croke park hotel , and it was a blast .the bar team (Jamie, Kent, Luke, Ciara) took the best care of us .. will defo be back in the future . The best service we had 10 out of 10, will be back in the future",5,2019,11,02
211,Great place to stay,"We spent the last two night of our Ireland tour in Dublin at the Croke Park Hotel. Everything was exceptional, our last night we had dinner at the bar. The food was amazing and our waiter Kent was the highlight of our day! Five stars for Kent!",5,2019,10,30
211,Worth a visit!,"Very clean hotel, the staff was kind and friendly especially the waiter named Kent from the bar ""The Sideline"". The rooms are well equipped and clean. The Croke Park Stadium is directly located next to the hotel which makes it suitable for sport event visitors. 

I can recommend it!",5,2019,10,30
211,Waitress Kimberly was wonderful!!,Such a nice Restaurant and hotel. The concierge was super helpful.   Restaurant on site. Nice atmosphere and Kimberly our waitress was excellent.  We enjoyed our food and her service was spot on..  she was delight to talk to.,5,2019,10,29
211,Miss,"Ciara behind the bar was great, she put up with us all night and still had a smile on her face! The bar was great had a lovely evening with colleagues would definitely recommend to people visiting Ireland",5,2019,10,28
211,Could not do enough for us! ,"Stayed here recently to attend a disability summit in Croke Park. They simply could not have been any more helpful. We had a child with a disability they went out of their way to accommodate us. Super friendly staff the rooms are huge, beds are beyond comfortable and the breakfast was fabulous. Could not recommend them highly enough. There was one woman in particular who I believe was from Derry on reception who was so nice to us. They make you feel like family. Well done to all 👍",5,2019,10,27
211,"Lovely hotel, great location and good staff!","Stayed here for one night recently for a work event, hotel was very clean, nice rooms and lovely breakfast. Location is perfect for Croke Park, it’s literally across the road. Staff at reception were very pleasant and helpful. Parking was included which was very handy. I will certainly return here for another stay and recommend to friends and colleagues. Thank you Croke Park Hotel for a lovely experience. Your staff at reception are a credit to you.",5,2019,10,26
211,Excellent!,"I stayed there for a week for business and I felt as much at home as one can feel. Great service, very comfortable rooms, breakfast is fine, although it may get busy and you’ll have to wait for toast and.m coffee, but full recommendation!",5,2019,10,26
211,Mr &mrs quinn,"Top class service, made feel important from the moment we arrived. Staff went above and beyond to make our anniversary stay memorable.

211,Business,"Fabulous hotel and really professional, friendly staff.  Kent in the bar was really friendly and great service! Clean and accommodating to all requests. Will be back definitely be back, lovely stay, well done!",5,2019,10,24
211,My favorite place in Dublin!,I’ve been to The Croke park hotel a few times before for business and it’s always fabulous. This time I went to the bar and had Allny and Jamie as my bartenders and they were amazing. I loved their energy so much I decided to stay for dinner and had Kent as my server. Kent was absolutely lovely and accommodating. I had a few things I wanted switched from the menu including a dairy allergy and he was extremely helpful and informative. I also had a chance to talk to Luke at the bar and he was so pleasant. I will definitely be returning and recommending The Sideline at Croke Park Hotel to everyone.,5,2019,10,22
211,DON'T BOOK IF YOU ARE A DISABLED CUSTOMER,"I requested a fully accessible room and did not receive such a room. 
1) bed was blocking bathroom access (i have a mobility aid) bed kept moving whenever i sat on it causing me to fall twice
2) bathroom tiles were extremely slippery and I nearly fell getting out of shower.
3)Shower door was too narrow for a disabled person to get in and out safely. also there was insufficient number of bars in the shower. ",1,2019,10,21
211,Fabulous,"Had a great stay at The Croke Park for 2 nights.  The room was perfect, clean and spacious.  The best bathrooms of any hotel in Dublin, and great to have Chromecast on the TV.  Reception were welcoming and helpful, Krishna and Jennifer were great.  Nice buzz in the Bar all weekend, service with a smile and a great Espresso Martini!  Look forward to staying again soon.",5,2019,10,21
211,Brilliant Night ,"We stayed here as a part of our anniversary trip - and were treated to excellent customer service, a great room and a brilliant location from which to explore the sights of Dublin!

We walked into the centre to visit O’Connell Street, Grafton Street and Temple Bar - all easily accessible but far enough away to have a peaceful night sleep!

Breakfast was excellent, and the hotel was clean and beautifully presented.",5,2019,10,19
211,Lovely Hotel,We recently stayed here as a family of four. The hotel is lovely and in a perfect location for access to all areas. I would have given this hotel top marks only the service can be quiet slow. We had to ask several members of staff in both the bar and at breakfast a few times for our orders over the course of our stay. Apart from this we really liked the hotel and would return.,4,2019,10,17
211,Excellent ,"Would highly recommend. Our first trip to Dublin. Lovely staff, great accommodation. Very clean hotel. Good breakfast. About 30 minute walk to Temple Street. Would definitely come back when we return. ",5,2019,10,15
211,GREAT STAY!!,"Our stay at the Croke Park Hotel was superb,  Staff were so pleasant and attentive and the food was lovely.  Would recommend this hotel to other guests. We had an event on in Croke Park Conference Centre, so staying at the Croke Park Hotel was so convenient, right across the road.",5,2019,10,14
211,Beautiful hotel close to city centre,"Stayed here numerous times and each time it just gets better! I have already booked my next stay! Staff make you feel so special from the minute you walk in until you leave! 
I would recommend anyone to stay here, its close to the city and right across from croke park stadium, which is a great day out! Food and cocktails are fab! We have booked through the reservations office each time and Clare Byrne has always been helpful with every stay.",5,2019,10,14
211,Highly recommend,"Myself and 2 friends stayed here as we were attending a concert in Dublin. The rooms are lovely and clean and the beds are very comfortable. The food is also very nice, we all got different dishes and we all really enjoyed them. The staff are very attentive and friendly. I would highly recommend this hotel to friends and family or anyone who is looking for a nice stay in Dublin. ",5,2019,10,14
211,Highly recommend,"We stayed here, 2 adults and 2 children (11&13) and had a great stay. The hotel was very modern and rooms comfortable. The hotel was much cheaper than others in Dublin, and it's about a 15 min walk into town but this didn't bother us. Definitely recommend staying here.",5,2019,10,13
211,Nice hotel to stay in Dublin,"My wife and I stayed at the hotel during our visit to Dublin. The hotel is remodeled and very spacious, staff very friendly. Deputy head concierge Krishna Kumar went out of his way to help us. The only drawback with the hotel is that its about a 30 minute walk to city center or 10 Euros for a taxi ride.",5,2019,10,13
211,Lorraine - lady with a little Irish magic!,I had drinks in the bar area after flying into Dublin for a private event in Croke Park a few weeks ago. Being irish and having left home in 2003 i was super excited to be in Dublin and excitedly ordered some irish cripss with my drinks but there were none on the menu.  Lorraine (who wasnt even serving our table) noticed that something was wrong and when I explained she disappeared and came back with some crisps for me!! It may seem like a small thing but honestly it summarises why people love Ireland and meant so much to me!!,4,2019,10,12
211,Birthday Celebration,"Had dinner for my friend's birthday celebration.The ambiance is very nice. Food selections are good and on reasonable prices.Staffs are very accommodating and friendly especially Keim, who is very patient with us while we order 😊. She also helped us with the surprise cake.
Luke at the bar was also commendable.
It was an enjoyable night.",4,2019,10,10
211,"Kent - Croke Park Hotel in Dublin, Ireland","Kent in the Bar Area was wonderful.  He served our entire large group 3 nights in a row while we were visiting Ireland in October 2019, and he was fun, courteous, quick and efficient.  The hotel should hang onto employees like him!",5,2019,10,09
211,Great Hotel in Dublin,"Stayed here for 4 nights and really enjoyed the hotel.  It's fairly new and even though it's on the north side of the city and not in the heart, it's still convenient and comfortable. Our room was nice, large and clean.  The restaurants at the hotel were very good and their Irish Breakfast Buffet was excellent.  Dinner also was terrific.  ",4,2019,10,09
211,Best Hotel in Dublin,"Love this hotel! The staff is fantastic! Eager to please, very accommodating.
Delicious Irish breakfast buffet daily!
I recommend the organic Atlantic salmon and the seafood linguine for a wonderful dining experience
Shout out to Chris the concierge, strong, quiet and helpful, Tricia, one of my favorite servers in the restaurants who always helps me out,  and Kent who had such a wonderful personality and made sure everything was great in The Sidebar restaurant and bar!",5,2019,10,07
211,Made my friend’s birthday celebration a blast!,We really had a great night celebrating my friend’s birthday celebration in Croke park. The food that we ordered is lovely and had some few drinks which we really enjoyed. I dont usually write comments like these but im very much happy because we got really good service from Keim and the bartender which is luke. Keim helped us surprise our friend by bringing the cake before 12mn and they sang happy birthday song to my friend. She is really happy and shocked. Very unexpected. Very friendly staff in the bar and will definitely come back soon! Thank you so much keim and luke!💓,5,2019,10,07
211,Lunch with friends ,"Was in the bar having lunch with my friends and had a lovely girl called Hayley serve me, she was very helpful with the menu as my friend was vegetarian and wasn’t sure on what to try, really appreciated the help :)",5,2019,10,06
211,Unexpected,"We stayed in this hotel for location for our family trip. The hotel, staff and location to Dublin is great. Highly recommend and the helpful staff made our stay in our Capital city a wonderful place to stay",5,2019,10,05
211,A great business hotel,"It's a fairly unprepossessing building from the outside, but a different story inside. The check in process was meticulously polite, and the room was extremely comfortable. The bathroom had a separate shower and bath, a long time since I've seen that. The bed was super comfortable and the place generally was super quiet at night. I great overnight stay for someone on business who needs some peace and comfort for the day ahead. The breakfast was excellent and staff very good. No place is perfect, so these are tiny quibbles. The pillows were very full, and I like a flat pillow since I sleep on my front. I would have liked to see smoked salmon at the breakfast buffet, but I'm sure I could have ordered some from the waiting staff. My room was a long walk from the lifts/elevators. Otherwise, a great stay.",5,2019,10,04
211,Hotel just opposite football stadium,Hotel is a little away from the city centre. It’s about a 10/15 taxi ride to go to the city centre. Room was clean and average in size. Hotel and room could do with modernisation.  Check in and out was fast and efficient.,4,2019,10,03
211,Clean Rooms + Friendly Staff,"I stayed here for one night whilst in Dublin, upon arrival the staff were very friendly and accommodating. The rooms were fresh, clean and came with all the necessary bits & bobs. Bed again clean and comfortable.
I would recommend and certainly stay again.",5,2019,10,02
211,"Long weekend, Pub tour","We choose the hotel while taking a pub tour in the city. The staff is extremely friendly, room was clean, beds were comfortable. We had some minor technical issues with the key cards but it was taken care of quickly.",4,2019,10,01
211,"Mixed Overall, but a particularly bad breakfast experience.","Stayed here along with another couple on Saturday night.

Starting with the good, the receptionist was very friendly, check in was really good and the rooms were nice and clean and well appointed.

We didn't eat here, but when we returned to the hotel at 10.30pm approx, we went to the bar. Sat down and hoped to order a drink. Would have went to the bar, but one lady who walked past said she would be right back to take an order. 15 mins passed, no-one came, caught the attention of another lady who said she would also be right back. No prized for guessing but she also vanished. So I went to the bar and mentioned the bad service to the lady at the bar. She was efficient and apologised. 

Next morning, breakfast, waitress appeared, took the orders efficiently enough. After she went away, we noticed other diners had menus, but we weren't offered any. 

The porridge when it arrived was so thick and dried out, it was practically as thick as tar and pretty much inedible and tasteless. The bacon in the buffet was down to the dregs, soakng in grease and there was barely enough left for the four of us, and what was left was so dried up yet still lying in grease, it was unpleasant. The white and black puddings were so dried out, they were like hockey pucks. It looks as if the food was left out too long and dried out under the lamps. However the sausages, hash browns, and bacon were all particularly greasy, and the fried eggs had that kind of glazed look which happens when they are left lying around too long. We were down for breakfast 40 mins before last orders and it seems that no more replenishing was going to happen on the buffets at that stage.

Id have to say, it was among the worst breakfasts Ive ever experienced in a hotel, if not the very worst. Also coffees were served I think twice incorrectly to one of our group. 

Overall, a disappointing experience. Hard to believe that this hotel is part of the Doyle Collection. We would not consider returning based on our experience. I think no matter how good rooms or location are, quality of service and food counts for a lot. Seemed to be no visible management in the bar on Saturday night or in the restaurant at breakfast, so there wasn't anyone to even highlight the issues to.",2,2019,09,30
211,Very nice rooms ,"Located right across the street from the Croke stadium. The rooms are nice and clean.  The is a clothes press, hairdryer, hot water pot (for coffee, tea or hot chocolate). The bathroom has a shower and a separate tub.  If you are traveling from the US be sure and bring a converter plug. There is a bottle of sparkling water and regular water that I was told are no charge and also there is 2 cookies they put per day.  There is a mini fridge but it was locked. For a fee they will unlock it.  ",5,2019,09,28
211,Cleanliness and lovely cation of Croke park hotel,"The hotel hallways were dirty (filthy carpets, trays of dirty dishes left in the hall for more than 12 hours, bags of dirty laundry left in the hall all day.   Local neighbourhood not safe for walking.  Told not to try local bar, tourists were not welcome.",1,2019,09,27
211,Wedding,"i truly can’t thank Croke Park hotel and their staff  enough for helping us with my daughters wedding.  They really worked with us throughout.. their catering was truly amazing 100% recommended.  Hotel was fantastic, catering was amazing, .. bar  was my favourite 😂 but bar staff were too ❤️   Anyone thinking of a wedding ???  Just do it..  ❤️❤️ You won’t be disappointed... THANK YOU ❤️❤️❤️",5,2019,09,26
211,Bar,Excellent service by kent and hayley. Veey nice. Both were vert helpful in finding more Local pubs. Plus they made me margarita which was not easy in Dublin. Always appreciate helpful staff. Would recommend!,5,2019,09,25
211,"Good hotel, very nice staff","We stayed here for 2 nights. The rooms were very well appointed and very clean. It was a pleasure to stay in a quiet hotel without the usual noise you sometimes get from Dublin hotels. There was no game on at the next door stadium and I had excellent service from all staff including waitresses, bar staff and concierge.
Food and drinks are not cheap, but it’s what you would expect to stay in a hotel like this.",5,2019,09,22
211,"The staff is great! Thanks, Kim!","I never write reviews.  Seriously. 
However, my experience at the front desk was wonderful (just flew in tired and a little cranky from a long trip😕) but they were really accommodating.
But the BEST of the staff served me in the lounge, on my second night there.  Shout out to Kim Dasig, new employee, hard worker, and student going for all that life can offer!!
If you’re lucky, she’ll be on duty when you need a little jolt of sweetness and hope for the future!!!👍👍👍👍👍",5,2019,09,22
211,Dissapointing,"All the rave reviews led us to stay here. I think it probably would be great for people attending matches at the stadium across the street, but not so much for the average visitor.

First, the pluses: Comfortable beds and very clean and comfortable rooms. The front desk staff were friendly enough, but not exceptionally so. Free garage parking.

The not-so-greats: Location—nothing interesting within walking distance. Not at all in an area suitable for tourists wanting to do anything other than soccer matches. Wifi didn’t work most of the time we were there, and nobody seemed too concerned about fixing it. The “Executive Lounge” is pretty lame. It smelled of soured beer and had barely any snacks or drinks. The one plus was the espresso machine, but in the morning the room was closed for maintenance. I asked the front desk if there was another area offering complimentary coffee—I was told I could go to the restaurant and buy one.

For a vacationer looking for an interesting and convenient area, stay elsewhere.",2,2019,09,16
211,Great Customer Service,"Top class in its customer service.  As a frequent visitor to this hotel it is lovely to be recognised & greated by name when you arrive at reception by Thomas & his team of Bernard, Deirdre & January to name a few.  Then the Hostess with the Mostess Antoinette is an absolute pleasure & knows all her customers and is always so welcoming & makes the time to have a chat with people which is lovely as travelling on your own is not always enjoyable.  New floor staff Kent & Kim are great & fit right in & ready to help out.  This hotel is spotlessly clean & offers free parking to customers which is on site & makes for a very convenient stay.  I would recommend this hotel without hesitation.",5,2019,09,16
211,Fantastic lodging!,"Pros: Free parking, quiet room, deep bathtub, elegant hotel, lovely breakfast
Cons: Not close to Temple Bar or downtown (wasn't a con for us)

We did not have high expectations for this hotel, to be honest and we were absolutely blown away. From the moment we checked in (warm face cloth to wash away the grime of the trip) to the fantastic recommendations from the concierge, Christopher, we enjoyed our stay from start to finish.

There were a few hiccups: the first room we were assigned had a heavy lingering odor of smoke from a previous guest. One call to the front desk and it was taken care of. We LOVED our room and the deep bathtub for soaking. The breakfast room was charming and the food was delicious. Yes, it is a little bit of a short walk to the Temple Bar district, but that really wasn't a big deal for us. We took the bus to Guinness for the day and then walked all over downtown before walking back int eh evening. 

Above all, the evening staff is their biggest asset. Sadly, subsequent hotels we stayed in during our Ireland honeymoon didn't meet the same quality standards we experienced at the Croke Park. 

Pro tip: We like a COLD room at night and hotels in Ireland do not typically include a top sheet. Ask for one. Otherwise, you'll find the bed made only with a duvet cover and bottom sheet.",5,2019,09,13
211,My Dublin Visit,Stayed at this hotel as my wife and daughter had previously enjoyed their stay at the hotel. My visit with my wife was to celebrate my 70th .We could not have chosen a better hotel.Although a short way out of the City well within walking distance 10 to 15 mins and you are in O'Connell  St.Excellent hotel with exceptional service from staff  all delivered with great enthusiasm The Hotel has a great arrangement with Do Dublin Hop on Hop off services making this all the easier. Concierge Services could not have been more helpful I have no hesitation in recommending this hotel if you are considering a stay Dublin,5,2019,09,13
211,Mixed opinion,"This is the first time I had to stay at ""The Croke Park"" and am not sure will do it again.   The location is not optimal for my needs, is in a mixed residential and industrial area, and it is across the street from the side of the stadium.   It is walking distance (30 mins or so) to the center of Dublin, but there are very few restaurants around, one convenience store about 500 meters away, otherwise not much.   The hotel is trying hard to maintain image through services and accommodations, but can do only so much.   Restaurant is good with very good quality but limited selection, the very good breakfast is included.   The room I had was large with plenty of storage, safebox, bar, complementary water, 65"" TV.  The bedding and towels were fresh, but furniture, carpet, tiles were dated, in need of refreshment.  And the awful smell in the bathroom that started at the evening!",3,2019,09,13
211,"Location,comfort,service","We stayed overnight with 4 children 7 years -12 years prior to camoige finals. We had the most relaxing time at hotel, staff, service and location of hotel was key to our enjoyment. Looking forward to a return trip",5,2019,09,10
211,Repeat customer - excellent as usual,"Stayed here this weekend for the camogie finals.  Stayed in a family room with two adults and two children.  Room was great - on the 4th floor so we had access to the executive lounge which was great - lots of space and room to relax, read, have a beverage and just enjoy the hotel. 

The hotel was at capacity this weekend, but we never felt crowded, hurried or anything other than relaxed and well taken care of. 

The breakfast was fab ,and along with the beautiful buffet we had some omelettes and pancakes cooked to order. 

The staff and the service are what sets this hotel apart from everywhere else.  Nothing is too much trouble, we were very well looked after and the staff really are fantastic. 

I should also add we visited the sister hotel - The Westbury while in town doing some shopping.  We went to the Westbury for some cocktails and when we said we were staying in their sister hotel the Croke Park we got a fabulous window table in the gallery overlooking Grafton Street.   Again, the staff here were also exceptional.",5,2019,09,09
211,Excellent stay at the Croke Park Hotel,"My family and I stayed 2 nights at the Hotel last week. Very nice hotel, great facilities, friendly helpful staff. Breakfast service was excellent. Rooms very clean and facilities great. Underground car park was a real bonus.",5,2019,09,09
211,Excellent,"The service we received throughout our stay was amazing, especially the service we received in the bar, the sideline, from the team of Kent, Sarah, Jamie and Luke was absolutely outstanding. The food was unreal. The rooms were great, with beds like clouds! All of the staff seemed happy and that they loved what they were doing. All around it was a brilliant stay.",5,2019,09,07
211,"The Croke Park Hotel, Dublin - Great Value","I recently stayed at the Croke Park Hotel, Dublin and it was great value for my money. Once I arrived at the Reception, I was greeted with a smile, looked after exceptionally well and my stay was a dream come true. I will definitely be back and will recommend The Croke Park Hotel to all my friends.",5,2019,09,05
211,Croke Park Dublin,"The front desk staff and bar staff were exceptional throughout our stay.  We had a few small problems with the booking process, but the desk staff took care of things quickly and professionally.  Underbuilding parking a real plus for this location.  Concierge staff were attentive and informative.  ",5,2019,09,04
211,Wonderful Stay,"Staying at the Croke P:ark Hotel is always a wonderful experience for me.
The welcome attention and respect I get is exceptional
Staying at the Hotel is like being at home with all the trimmings.
I would stay nowhere else when in Dublin",5,2019,09,04
211,Still delivering a great service,"I have left a few reviews on this Hotel so wont go over what I have said in the past its still great ................but for some reason they have changed the bar food menu which I think is a big mistake . Its mostly what you would describe as snack food you might order if you had been drinking and felt peckish.
Previously you could get Fish and Chips , Club sandwich , Pasta , Chicken salad , Shepherds pie etc which when you are dining on your own is fine as you can sit at the bar and watch some sports .  
Really hope the Hotel has a rethink here as for me I would not now eat at the Hotel which is a shame. 
Special mention for Antoinette who sorted out my dinner in the bar and staff as usual were excellent especially Peter who always goes out his way to stop and have a chat",5,2019,09,02
211,"Brilliant hotel, lovely stay","Checked in to the Croke Park late, not a problem, for them communication with late check in guests is quick and responsive. The room is well appointed with aircon. Massive TV and lovely bathroom. The bathroom had a large walk in shower and a bath. The main room had all the amenities you would expect, mini bar, trouser press, safe, teas and coffee and high speed network access. Staff were super helpful, even printing our boarding pass for our flight. Thanks so much. This is a big sporting hotel next to the stadium and is well equipped to handle any type of guest. The only reason we gave it a 4 star is that the breakfast didn’t have some of the things we would like such as beans, the fruit was not fully stocked and the juice table needed cleaning. but I’m sure that if I asked they would sort it as the service is great. I would give it 4.5 stars if I could.",4,2019,08,30
211,Pleasant Croke Park stay,"Very nice stay from the moment we were greeted at Reception to  check-out.
Only thing was a restrictive menu for the evening bar food, albeit what we ended up ordering tasted good. Car-parking underground was easy accessed even if direction signage from car-park to hotel could be improved, but small matter in overall great weekend",5,2019,08,29
211,"Location a little far out, but a great hotel with an exceptional breakfast","We chose this because of a good proximity to the centre of Dublin, looked like a nice hotel, and breakfast was included. It was a little further out than expected, around 15-20 mins fast walk, but it meant it was quiet, with little traffic. Then hotel is very well presented, and the staff were excellent, but there is one thing that to me, is very note-worthy... The breakfast. We`ve been let down by many hotels in the past, but this is by far the best English/Irish breakfast we`ve had and my other half is a vegetarian. We would stay here again if visiting Dublin as many others that we saw in Dublin were dated etc. If you don`t mind a little walk, this was a great hotel",4,2019,08,28
211,GREAT Hotel,Travel for last night of vacation with family of 5. We had 2 rooms at 5 different hotels for the week. Croke Park was one of the best we stayed at. Safe area and a quick taxi ride to anywhere needed. Excellent condition and reasonable rates/food choices. stayed at sister hotel River Lee with same quality.....that is why I said one of the best!!,5,2019,08,27
211,Outstanding Value,"This hotel is among the most outstanding values on any continent. i have stayed in over 100 hotels and found this among the strongest in terms of price, cleanliness, service, food quality and location. ",5,2019,08,25
211,Average,"Spent a couple of nights here in a triple room, on arrival we received a warm enough welcome booked in and proceeded to our room.
Beds are small and not very comfortable,  considering it's a triple room we had two bath towels two cup and saucers and one teabag.
Ensuite is average enough not what I'd consider a 4* property. 
Breakfast in morning is a bit hit and miss, staff where nice are a bit scattered,  on a plus though there scramble eggs were delicious. 
Bar is big and a good selection of wines, beers and spirits,  really nice staff here and super at their jobs.
Both nights we had disturbances on the corridor which I thought should have been dealt with as on the first night it went on for 15 - 20 minutes. 
Sockets on our desk would not work which was restricting between phone charging and hairdryer etc.
Food in restaurant is good but expensive and portion sizes are small, every side dish is upsold to you when ordering which I found annoying. 
Would I come back, possibly but I'd certainly be requesting a better room next tg time. ",3,2019,08,25
211,The Croke Park,The restaurant at The Croke Park hotel has excellent dishes. Your waiter Alejandro has great professionalism and perfect service. It is not necessary to stay at the hotel to eat. Recommended for hotel guests as well as for those who want to eat.,5,2019,08,25
211,Bar service,"Visited this hotel for a friends' get together on 19 August. Reception staff were helpful and friendly.  Rooms are very well appointed. Nice sized and bright ensuite.
However we found the bar service very poor.  At about 4.30 pm having settled into our rooms we decided to have a glass of wine. Bar wasn't busy with plenty of comfortable seating available and at least four staff present. We ordered 2 glasses of white and one red. Paid for it immediately. The girl who took my card assured me the order would be brought to our table. So we waited and waited! I could see the girl who had taken our order walking around performing other duties. I thought she might have forgotten so I reminded her. She said I'm sorry we're short staffed. I pointed out that there were 3 or 4  people about but she explained that they (including herself) were floor staff and there was only one bar staff on duty?? Anyway we eventually got our order and the white wine was actually warm! We had to get ice to make it drinkable.  Very disappointed. We had intended eating there but on the basis of this we decided against it.  Just a pity as otherwise this is a lovely hotel. Incidentally the breakfast was very good and the staff on the morning were very good.",3,2019,08,25
211,Best service,"This hotel had the best service on our trip to Ireland. The parking was included and convenient. The bar and restaurant were excellent. The location was a bit of a walk to the city centre, but certainly part of the walking we expected on our trip. It also was in a nice neighborhood with good restaurants and a casino.",5,2019,08,24
211,Most friendly and helpful staff🙂,"Beautiful hotel, very clean and modern. The breakfast was fabulous, the staff couldn’t have been more friendly and helpful. Had a baby with us and it was a very family fee hotel. Really enjoyed our stay.",5,2019,08,22
211,A perfect stay with excellent people,"Just chose croke park as a recommendation in a site where I was buying my airplane tickets from. The location was a bit of a surprise, as I didn't check it before.... it was about 20 minutes walk to Dublin Center.

We were received by extremely friendly staff, on a very busy day (which we got an email warning us about), regarding a semi-final game of gaelic football in the stadium which was just across the road. Regardless they took the time to make us welcome, we arrived too early for check-in but they gave us some indications, took our luggage, first freshened up in the hotel and just hit the town.

Everyone was perfect. A huge tv with a huge bed, complimentary water and coffee in the room, a ver clean bathroom with nice amenities... I really have nothing to speak bad of it.  Even though it was a big walk, specially when returning... it was doable and the taxi rides accounted for great stories they would share with us.",5,2019,08,21
211,A very good value business hotel,"Execellent hotel with clean, moderm rooms and decent bath with a separate shower stall and tub. Full Irish breakfast. It is opposite the Croke Park stadium and about a 25 min walk from the City Centre. If you arrive on a match day, you will have to walk with your bags for the last 800m as cops barricade the streets. Really lively after match party in the hotel bar and restaurant. ",4,2019,08,21
211,Above and Beyond ,I wanted to post this review while the experience was fresh in my mind. My boyfriend and I stayed at Croke Park Hotel so we could be close to Croke Park Stadium to watch the All Ireland Senior Hurling Final. The staff at Croke Park were amazing. It's an extremely busy time for them but they did all they could to make sure our stay was comfortable and special. Thank you so much. It was a special trip and we appreciated how thoughtful everyone was. The room we stayed in looked to the stadium which was perfect for us. The bed was very comfortable and the room was spotless.,5,2019,08,20
211,Lovely room,"We are a couple and had a room with one twin and one double bed. The only drawback to this was that there is no side table for one side of the double bed. The bed was comfy, but the pillows flattened out as soon as you touched them (seems to be very common in Ireland). The room was very spacious, and the bathroom was clean and well appointed. Breakfast was great. It's not super close to the city center, but we only stayed one night at the end of a tour, so it wasn't too much of an issue for us. Croke Park stadium is literally right across the street, so if you're looking to see that, you're in the right place.
The service at the hotel is excellent, and I wanted to give a special shoutout to Rachael at the front desk who was super helpful at getting us info on how to get from this hotel to another once our tour was over.",4,2019,08,17
211,Very clean rooms & friendly staff.,"Me and my family stayed there for 3 days in August'19.The hotel is not situated within the city centre but it is only 20 mnts of walk to the city centre.There is a hop on hop off pick up from the hotel.My stay was coincidently during the GAA Gaelic matches in the Croke park stadium which is just next to the hotel.The area was heavily crowded with about 70,000 spectators and the roads to the hotel were blocked by the police during the match days and we had a tough time reaching the hotel on those days.
Before you book,check if any major events or games are happening in the stadium,unless you are a spectator to the event.
Otherwise,the hotel was excellent and the rooms were very clean and the staff was extremely friendly.",4,2019,08,17
211,Expected Much More,"My partner and I stayed at CrokePark Hotel for one night after visiting family on Dublin's north side. The area itself didn’t look much but there was a nice big car park underground. 

Stayed for one night (thankfully not more). Really basic accommodation and requiring a good cleaning. Bed was not that comfortable but sheets etc seemed clean (unlike rest of room). Bird droppings on the windows which spoiled an already poor view. Bird droppings were well dried and looked as if it had been there for a good few days. The room was kinda grubby and terrible grout on tiles in the bathroom. (My partner's a tiler by trade so he knows). The room floor under the bed itself was dirty with crumbs and someones toe nail clippings (pretty disgusting). It could have done with a good clean and a vacuum. On the up the staff on check in were nice and welcoming. 

Breakfast was nothing special but at the same time not bad either. There is a bar and restaurant of their own but we didn't go. Lobby furniture was grubby and torn, and shrub area outside the front door was unkept.

All in all, we did not enjoy our stay and the cost was not low enough to lower our expectations in line with what we got. Wouldn’t stay again.",2,2019,08,17
211,Loved it,"Such a fancy hotel! Friendly staff and the room was big, giant tv in room, beautiful bathroom, and a/c. Perfect location, walking distance to all the good places. Right across from the stadium so be sure to book ahead of time if it’s during the time a match is going on. ",5,2019,08,16
211,Very comfortable stay!!,My visit to Croke park Hotel was filled with joyous and comfortable experience. I can't remember the names of anyone in specific as whosoever I met at the hotel tried their best to fulfill a superb experience. The Irish breakfast spread was superb. I think that the restaurant could introduce a few more food choices specially for lunch and dinner as the menu was very limited.,5,2019,08,14
211,Croke Park hotel,"Location 20 minute walk to city centre, 5-10 mins in a taxi- 15 Euros.  Hotel clean with pleasant staff and good breakfast & bar food.  Didn't eat in restaurant so cant comment.  Free parking a good extra as many other hotels didn't offer this.  We would stay again",5,2019,08,13
211,Outstanding,The quality and standards of this Hotel is amazing. To have an abundance of helpful and friendly staff in one Hotel is superb. This Hotel exceeded our expectations especially as we were staying at an extremely busy time for the Hotel. Our room and bathroom were beautiful and the facilities were fantastic. The location was perfect for us.,5,2019,08,13
211,Helpful staff ,We stayed at Croke Park Hotel before and after a tour for a total of 3 nights. The first night we arrived it happened to be the semi-final of the Gaelic Games. The whole area was extremely busy but the staff were very helpful and gave us access to the club lounge to compensate for the inconvenience. Staff were friendly and remembered us when we returned from our tour - made us feel extremely welcome ,5,2019,08,07
211,Hard to beat,"Stayed here with my wife and children as my brother in law was playing for Down in Croke Park. All the staff we encountered were very friendly and helpful. The rooms were very modern and stylish. The bar area was very comfortable and ambiance was very relaxed. The executive lounge was an added bonus, good varity of local products. Happy to return to the Croke Park hotel anytime. Couldnt ask for better, especially for an event at Croke Park ",5,2019,08,07
211,Excellent hotel with very helpful staff,"Croke Park Hotel just gets better each time we visit. Rooms are lovely, food is delicious and the executive lounge is just great. Location is good and the staff excellent. As always we cannot wait to visit again very soon. ",5,2019,08,06
211,Weekend Stay,"Amazing Hotel and situated very close to City Centre
The Hotel is beautiful. The rooms are amazing and very spacious.
The Staff are of the highest quality you could wish for.
The food is fantastic.
Great car parking
Reception area is very spacious and comfortable.
The Bar is so comfortable and the large screen is perfect for sports",5,2019,08,06
211,Hotel very good. Food in Sideline bar very poor standard,Hotel excellent. Food in the Sideline bar not very good standard. Simple toasted sandwich had chunks of ham and fat inside. Eggs Benedict again just had ham and fat placed inside. Overall very average eating experience compared to hotel room.,4,2019,08,05
211,Continue to be Exceptional,"I have stayed several times in Croke Park Hotel and I am extremely pleasantly surprised every time I spend time there. The same exceptional quality, value for money but most important staff attitude and professionalism. Warmly recommended.",5,2019,08,05
211,Bad recommendation of the Discovery programm!,"-breakfast: dishes were not clean, 
-room: deluxe???, spots on the carpet and lampshade, curtains with spots and had a bad odour, towels with big holes, very noisy within the hotel while room service, overused furniture; dirty and empty refrigerator/minibar was mentioned to staff, but nothing changed until departure (6 nights!), ...
-Bar: unmotivated and bad trained service staff in the evening
-Lobby: electronic based Taxi-call took a long time, meanwhile other guests were served with free taxis at the hotel entrance ",2,2019,08,04
211,Nice hotel,"Stayed here recently. Nice hotel good location for where we were visiting. Very comfy bed. Excellent food and our server, Ott, was brilliant, friendly and efficient. Made our evening 😁. Will be back.",4,2019,08,03
211,Would recommend ,"Stayed here at the beginning and the end of a trip around Ireland. My only real complaint about the hotel is that it isn’t exactly located in the middle of any local attractions, unless you are attending an event across the street at the stadium. Other than this, it is great. The rooms are clean, comfortable, and spacious. The bathrooms were very well done. The front desk staff is extremely friendly and accommodating. The breakfast is excellent and much better than the included ones that you find in the US. The bar is comfortable and serves excellent appetizers. So, if you are willing to walk a bit, or hire a taxi, this is a great option.",4,2019,08,03
211,Nice if you like to walk,"This hotel is a 25-minutes walk from the town center. Some parts around the hotel are not too nice, other are fine. If you take Dorset street towards the center it's perfectly fine.  

The hotel is really nice,  the gym is great, breakfast, although not included, is nice too. The area is really quiet,  except from when there is a game on the stadium which is really close, right at the other side of the street. The personnel is friendly and very helpful. The beds are comfortable.  We had a view towards the canal, which was nice. Fun fact: they actually sell vibrating penis rings in a vending machine in the men's bathroom at the reception. ",5,2019,08,02
211,Excellent experience,"I always come to this hotel, the rooms are very comfortable and spacious, the breakfast is fantastic, there is parking, they have also renovated the bar and restaurant, where the very nice and talented Doris works !!!  Thanks to all the staff !!!
Ivan",5,2019,08,01
211,Great experience,"Just a quick review to compliment the staff of the hotel, I was staying the night before the Limerick v's Kilkenny Semi Final with my Dad who is 86.  I had requested a room close tot he lift and we were able to check in at 1pm which was great. The bar staff couldn't have been nicer to us, we were in and out of the bar a few times on the Friday and met a lovely lady Antoinette who really looked after us and went above & beyond to look after my Dad, another really lovely young girl working in the bar too.  The facilities were great, we could book lunch on Sat when we knew the hotel would be packed before the match and everything worked like clock work, a well oiled machine, just wanted to compliment the restaurant and bar staff as they work so hard especially on those match days.  We were allowed access to the Executive lounge for an hour before the match as downstairs got too busy for my Dad and we were delighted with that. We really enjoyed our stay and will be back again!  Thank you",5,2019,08,01
211,Nice concierge,I stayed here one night with a CIE Tour.  The concierge brought up my suitcase and even traded out a bottled water for me.  When my sink started leaking they immediately sent someone to fix it.  My room was very comfortable.  For dinner my sandwich was a little burnt but breakfast was better.,4,2019,07,30
211,Could not have been better,"First time my wife and myself have never been to Dublin and I could not of had a better time then staying at the Croke Park Hotel.The manager Sean Reid went beyond to make sure we were comfortable in everyway even went out of his way to get tickets to a GAA game that was happening across the street at Croke Park which we had never seen and had a great time .Krishna Kumar ( Concierge) made sure that we saw everything but made sure we did not burn ourselfs out and to enjoy our stay.I would also like to thank Theresa,Raj,Ott,Tania,Jennifer,and to the others that made us feel at home.Thanks Again Shawn and Olga Lennon",5,2019,07,30
211,"Great location, friendly staff.","Excellent location near the port and on the edge of the city. Really helpful staff. Great pint of Guinness in the bar. Large, clean, functional room. Good car parking facilities on site. Would definitely stay again.",5,2019,07,30
211,Beyond the call of duty - Sean reid,I'm so sorry that it has taken so long to write this. I rang the hotel and spoke to Mr.Sean Reid and requested 2 rooms adjacent together as we were taking my dad to dublin for an operation also requested room near lift. Well I must say we got all that and more. We have stayed at the hotel before and were always happy but this time they really showed us that service in the hotel is 5 star. Thank you again we will be back.  ,5,2019,07,30
211,Bittersweet...,"I enjoyed my stay here BUT, and it's a huge BUT....despite a 'heads up email'  from management (considerate) that I would be staying here during major sporting events all weekend- after all, it is directly across the street from Europe's 3rd largest stadium-Croke Park. Essentially...""there was no need for alarm, just be aware"". Here's the problem: I couldn't even get a coffee in the Hotel as the lineups to order were roughly 50 people long queued along one whole wall of the restaurant. Most of the patrons in line were in their team colours, in large groups - out to have a bit of fun pre and post-match. I get that. But to have to jostle my way out of an elevator through a sea of non-hotel guests or to exit by foot through the front doors was an intimidating process ALL WEEKEND LONG. Why not take proactive steps to ensure the people paying hundreds of Euro's per night for the priviledge of actually sleeping in the hotel feel a sense of inclusion? Why not offer us a ticket to go see this unique sport. Or maybe offer room service without the surcharge when the queues are unreasonable for an Innkeeper to manage? Surely you can do better than an email and a good luck missive? On a positive note, both my check in (delightful chap) and check out (lovely Jannary- thank you) were professional and well done. Parking is secure and free and was appreciated. The bed was amazing, and the room -spacious and well appointed. I enjoyed the freedom of walking into the centre of Dublin and marvelling at this historic city and it's wonderful charm. If you took steps to make me feel special at the Hotel during these sporting events, then and ONLY then would I return. But at this point, I felt quite duped by the fact that the hotel had my money and I was basically thrown to the wolves to fare on my own. Not good enough Croke Park Hotel management team. I love my sport but I certainly didn't feel a part of anything - I felt like a complete outsider while you crammed hundreds of sporting fans into your lobby, bar, courtyard, restaurant & common spaces. I was happy when check out time arrive which is not a great feeling to leave a proper with.",3,2019,07,29
211,Avoid on Match Days- chaos after the game,"We got an email from the hotel 3 days before we arrived, saying it was an All Ireland Hurling Semi Final Match Day on our arrival and that roads would be closed and a Garda presence around the area. True, we had to negotiate Garda road blocks to get to the car park.

The first room we were given (3rd floor) smelled badly, so we changed to a first floor one which didn't smell.

In hindsight we wouldn't have stayed had we known how the Hotel would be totally swamped with Hurling Fans, and when I say swamped, you couldn't move downstairs as they were shoulder to shoulder once the match finished, some getting severely inebriated celebrating their team's win. Huge queues to use the ground floor female toilets.

I went into the 4th floor residents lounge and it looked like Beirut on a bad day - all the cold refrigerated drinks were gone, no cups (paper or otherwise) to get a drink from the hot drink machine, discarded crockery and part used bottles all over, and no-one picking up on it.

The ""restaurant"" was overcome with fans, so we walked outsidelooking for somewhere to eat. The area is not salubrious - graffiti, run down flats, beggars asking for money and scruffy take-aways. Eventually we gave up, returned to the room and ordered a Deliveroo.

We were advised to go early for breakfast due to the Fans tending to leave breakfast until 9-30am onwards, and causing some congestion in the dining room.

On the plus side, the bedroom was nice, albeit overlooking the railway lines. We stayed in the Ashling by the Liffey last week for similar money and it knocked spots off this place. The three lifts are good too.",3,2019,07,29
211,Nicer than expected,"It's rare that you can say that the hotel is better than website indicates but that has been our very pleasant surprise.  Hotel appears very new.  Our King hotel room was equipped with all amenities, including safe, large screen TV, refrigerator, kettle, biscuits, tea.  Bathroom had both a walk-in shower and large soaking tub.  Staff were very friendly.  Very very pleased!",5,2019,07,26
211,Outstanding ,"This hotel was on point for everything. The staff were fantastic, food was delicious and atmosphere was very pleasant. 
Highly recommend this hotel. Easy walk to OConnell Street
I had an executive suite which was very like a standard room but with access to a private bar on 4th floor",5,2019,07,26
211,Lovely hotel but VERY LOUD,"The room itself is extremely comfortable and spacious. However, we happen to be staying during a time when they were having Gaelic games and as this hotel is directly across the street from the stadium, the hotel was swamped with drunk sports fans until all hours of the morning. The restaurant was unavailable to us and when we were granted access to a special guest area however it was very untidy and there were no snacks/drinks left by the time we went up there. 
Other than that, I would recommend this place. It is quite far from the sites of Dublin itself so you either need to use a taxi or hire a car. The parking deck is quite secure but small. We came home late both nights and almost had no space to park. ",4,2019,07,24
211,Croke Park Hotel Dublin,"This was the 4th return to the hotel although it was away from the town centre due to high quality of service. From the airport you can take bus 16 close to Drumcondra railway station. Get off just after Tesco on the left hand side, ask any passerby the directions to go to Croke Park stadium. The hotel is on Jones Road opposite the stadium. If you are tired or have luggage or it is raining a taxi will cost about 20 Euros but slow traffic may drive up this price, From the bus stop where you get off for the hotel, you can take the same bus 16 or 11 or 13 to town and get off at O'Connell Street. Do not buy a Visitor Leap Card at the airport as it is not possible to re-credit it at a newsagent or Spar or Costcutter subsequently. On the same side as the hotel is Enterprise Rent a Car and also an Italian restaurant.",5,2019,07,22
211,Family GAA visit,We stayed at the Croke Park Hotel for the Wexford and Kilkenny Leinster Finals. We had a lovely room with 2 large double beds. The room was fresh and airy. Even with the 2 beds there was still plenty of room for the kids to play with their toys. Breakfast was delicious. My parents had a lovely spacious double room too. Everybody was friendly and welcoming. The hotel got very busy for the match but the hotel was well prepared. I regret not booking the hotel for this weekend again earlier. I have rang lots of times to book the Saturday and Sunday but rooms are full. Keep up the fantastic work everybody is doing at the hotel.,5,2019,07,22
211,Faultless,Staff were so pleasant and nothing was too much trouble for them. The room was much larger and better furnished than I expected. Also spotless clean. The location was great for us as we were going to a GAA match in Croke Park which is just across the road. A very pleasant stay.,5,2019,07,22
211,Excepcional quality and friendly service,"The Croke facilities are very good, clean and all the people are very friendly. The concierge was available for any need we had. Although just next to the stadium the environment is very quite and we are 15 min walking distance to the city center. The breakfast is very good. ",5,2019,07,22
211,Laura,"We stayed here to attend a football match.  The hotel was packed with GAA fans, yet the hotel maintained order, cleanliness and a lovely atmosphere.
The rooms and corridors were spotless, quite luxurious and every staff member I encountered were smiling and courteous.  We dined in the restaurant after the game, the service was so good for it being so busy.  The menu however was limited, basic.  This may have been due to the large volume of people.
",5,2019,07,22
211,Fantastic staff ,"Stayed here with my parents and inlaws and our 5 weeks old baby. We booked the hotel for convenience as it was our daughter's 1st trip away and 1st visit to Croke Park to the Leinster Final. From the moment I booked to when we left the hotel, the staff couldn't do enough for us. I booked a double room and asked if it was possible we be allocated a room with a single bed in it also as sometimes my baby will not settle I'm her crib and sleeps on the bed. They did this for me with no extra cost. We also requested an early check in so I could feed her in privacy before the game and when we arrived at 11.30am, we were thrilled to find our room was ready. We ate in the restaurant for lunch and dinner and the food was very good and again very nice staff who made us feel very welcome despite being very very busy. Our room was lovely. Nice and spacious. Breakfast was very nice, although I ended up asking my husband to bring up my breakfast to me in the room as my daughter had an unsettled night. The staff couldn't do enough for him. Got me a full breakfast tray and offered to carry it up to the room. The reception girls were very nice and due to your fantastic staff and excellent location, we have booked again for the All Ireland Semi Final game. We look forward to returning to your hotel. ",5,2019,07,22
211,It grew on us favorably each day,"Although not well situated, being not very close to city, and directly across the road from the stadium, as it happened our stay coincided with the Gaelic football finals weekend so plenty of action in the precinct. Very friendly staff. Rooms only had views of stadium walls so no views but room itself was comfortable. Probably will look for better situated hotel next trip, but this was ok not having been to Dublin before. ",3,2019,07,20
211,"Friendly staff, comfortable room","The staff were welcoming and friendly including, reception staff, Consierge, domestic staff and waiters. 

The hotel room was lovely, very clean and comfortable. 

The bar was really nice. I liked the decor throughout the hotel.

The only reason it gets a 4/5 is because the tv was down and when I rang reception they said they would send someone up but that person never arrived. 

The location is out of the way if you want to  walk in to the city centre several times in the day as we did. It does take a good half an hour one way which we didn’t anticipate. 

Finally the surrounding area of the hotel is a dump to put it politely. I wouldn’t have felt safe walking here alone at night. 

Overall I would not stay here again purely because of the location.",4,2019,07,19
211,"Happy, Safe and Cared For","Krishna and Steven in the Concierge Dept went above and beyond to help us solve problems, store our luggage, arrange taxis, make reservations and get tips and directions. Krishna was masterful in his emotional intelligence skills. 5 thumbs up! I loved the breakfast that was provided--so many choices and great servers. This was a lovely way to start each day. The rooms were very clean and everything was provided for one's comfort. The bathtub and shower were roomy and well-designed. Hot water was in copious supply. The flat screen TV was large and perfect for watching the Women's Soccer World Cup!!! We stayed here 5 nights at the beginning of our trip and returned for the last night of our trip. It truly felt like coming home on that last night!! Finally, I love how many social spaces Croke Park has on its ground floor offering food and drinks for everything from a visit with one or two friends all the way up to large group parties.",5,2019,07,18
211,Excellent property; nice and quiet area,Very good area away from hustle and bustle; not in city center so you would need to travel a bit to get to the sights; otherwise great area for coming from airport; very nice touches like a box of Butter's chocolates on arrival and a small pack of cookies!!,5,2019,07,17
211,Good spot hits the spot and then again,"Stayed over as annual work BBQ was on. Really great hotel own carpark and everything.  perfect. Stayed in room on 4th floor what luxury got a fab breakfast on 4th floor really enjoyed my stay.  Will stay again.
Regards
Matt",5,2019,07,17
211,Pleasant stay,"It's a lovely hotel with comfortable spacious rooms. Great staff and reasonably priced food and drink. A big advantage is the free car parking,and they had no issue with us leaving the car for a few hours post checkout.  The hotel is in a great location, easy walking distance from the city centre. Looking forward to our next stay and would and have rrecommended to plenty",5,2019,07,17
211,Best Hotel in Dublin!!!,"Booked to stay for four nights bed and breakfast. A lovely receptionist Hayley welcomed us. It's always great to be greeted with a smiling happy face.
Our room was 426 on the fourth floor which meant we also had access to the executive guest lounge which is great for a coffee, fruit and even a continental breakfast if you do not want to go to the main restaurant.
Our room was excellent. It had a super cosy king size bed and was very well cleaned.
We enjoyed the breakfast every morning. A special thank you to Karl who looked after us, and went the extra mile for us. We enjoyed his friendly conversation and hope he is there on our next visit.
We ordered poached eggs every morning. There is a great selection for breakfast. I personally loved the fresh fruit salad which was on two mornings.
The hotel is a great base to stay and see Dublin and beyond. The first night we walked to Fagans in Drumcondra for dinner. This was only a ten minute walk. The second day we walked to Connolly Train station which was roughly 15 to 18 minutes. We got the dart to Howth. This was roughly 6 euros return each. We did the Howth cliff walk which was amazing.
The next day we walked into Dublin again only 10 to 15 minutes walk. We got a taxi back that night to the hotel which was 12 euros.
The last day we walked again to Connolly Train station and got the dart to Bray. We bought a return to Greystones which was roughly 12 euros each return. We walked from Bray to Greystones which was 1.5 hours. Again amazing scenery.
We did not dine in Croke Park this time as we were out and about but next time we definitely will.
Overall a brilliant relaxing break. The hotel was busy at the weekend with hurling and football fans but this did not interfere with our stay at all.
Jannary checked us out of the hotel and again her service and smile was excellent.
Thank you to everyone in The Croke Park team for a great stay. 
We can't wait to go back to our favourite hotel in Dublin. ",5,2019,07,17
211,Lovely steak,"Thanks to Ott K for perfect service and great steak.

I ordered 10 oz Striploin medium rare and it was stuffing great amazing meal alongside with great service , all of my expectations were fullfilled and i even got extra chocolates :D",5,2019,07,16
211,******************** Great Hotel with Excelllent Service ! ************************,"I travel for work and recently had a chance to stay at The Croke  Park Hotel in Dublin, Ireland - twice as a matter of fact.  The hotel is nice and is just about 15 minutes walk to the city center. A hotel is nice not merely by being a hotel with a big brand name attached to it,  or by providing the best amenities or even by providing a good, sumptuous breakfast.  Anything that makes a hotel good for a guest is the service provided by the staff.  Unhelpful and rude staff can kill all the positives that a hotel might have.  This hotel is absolutely commendable for excellent staff, who would go an extra mile to make your stay extra special.  I would like to complement Ms. Roisin ( am not sure about the spellings) for taking care of my room preference. Also to mention is a lady at the Reception, Ms. Jannary, who has an extremely pleasant demeanor and a very professional and helpful attitude. She was there on both occasions while checking in and has a very welcoming smile. The others at the Reception were Ms. Katarin and Rachel, whom I did not have much interaction with but have every reason to believe, were equally good. All in all, this hotel has some very nice employees on their payroll, who take care of their guests to make their stay a pleasant and a comfortable one. The rooms are nice and buffet breakfast a good start for the day ahead. Give this hotel a try and hopefully you will enjoy your stay as much as I did.",5,2019,07,15
211,Very good hotel,"This is a good hotel. Service was excellent, breakfast was good, and rooms were comfortable, with probably the best pillows I ever tried. 
Location is ok if you don't mind some walking, or just a short ride.",5,2019,07,15
211,Stadium Tour with a Guide!,"Unlike so many stadium tours these days, the Croke Park tour is led by an actual living and breathing human!  In fact, our guide was a former hurling player!  Excellent tour that this non-Irish person found informative about the all amateur sports of Gaelic Football and Hurling.  Worth taking the tour to find out about these uniquely Irish sports that are truly played for the love of the game.",5,2019,07,15
211,BBQ,"Had an amazing night with my colleagues at a BBQ. Food and music was excellent 
Come meet January and Thompaz at reception. Then Peter and Colin in the hotel. The staff make this hotel as they make everyone feel special and comfortable.

211,So very nice,"We spent one night at The Croke Park in the first half of July as a family of four (with kids 15 months and 3.5 years) and the experience was excellent. Service across the board was excellent from Jennifer (wearing an in-training name tag) at the front desk, who was knowledgeable and empathetic, to the kind woman in the bistro helping us figure out what to order from room service as we navigated menus and allergies. Our room, with two double beds and enough space for a “kids cot” (pack & play), was quiet, comfortable and had a really nice, clean and tasteful bathroom with separate tub and shower. The breakfast buffet was wonderful prior to our flight back to the states (the Dublin airport is maybe 20 minutes away). Without a doubt we will stay at The Croke Park again.",5,2019,07,13
211,Wonderful Stau,"We stay here often and are never disappointed. It's a fine hotel lovely big comfy rooms. Great staff and reasonably priced food and drink. A big advantage is the free car parking, very few hotels offer this. The hotel is in a great location, easy walking distance from the city centre. Looking forward to our next stay. ",5,2019,07,13
211,"Location, Comfort and Style","Stayed here recently for a concert in Croke Park. Obviously, the location could not be bettered but was not expecting the hotel to be as good. Food in the restaurant was reasonably priced and despite the fact that it was very busy, the food was cooked, presented and served perfectly. The room was spacious and very comfortable. The breakfast choice was good and the staff throughout the hotel were friendly and helpful. Could not recommend this hotel enough. Top Class",5,2019,07,12
211,Fabulous 1 night stay,"We stayed over for 1 night for he Westlife concert which was taking place directly across the road in Croke park stadium..
From the moment we checked in until we departed on the Saturday morning,we had a brilliant time and really enjoyed our stay ",5,2019,07,09
211,Top class,"Stayed here in June booked another wee trip to Dublin for last weekend and before I left I booked another room for August this hotel is spotless luxurious and the staff are the best in the world. As I’ve a disability I was facilitated with a superb accessibile room which is st the front of the building and overlooks the stunning croke park stadium I felt like a VIP the concierge met me an the car park when I arrived and took up my bags and brought me to a special desk to check in,outstanding!!
The beds are spacious and comfy and the decor is a beautiful blend of traditional and trendy. 

Their food is superb and always served with a smile. Special mention to Hannah who checked me in, booked me a taxi  for sight seeing and remembered my name from my last visit. If I won the lotto I’d move in just love this place.",5,2019,07,08
211,Brilliant Service,"Hotel staff couldn't do enough, we ordered food to our room Saturday night after the concert and got breakfast to the room the service was top class. Someone with us was celebrating their 30th and when we arrived she was made special with Cava in the room. Staff couldn't do enough for us.",5,2019,07,08
211,Exceptional Service,"I booked here because the hotel is a VIP member with Expedia. I wasn't expecting much more than a decent spot to stay the night. But wow, I was blown by the service and quality! I only wish we had a longer stay in Dublin. I was most impressed by the care and attentiveness of the staff. They gave us the best check in of our whole 3-week vacation around the UK/Ireland. First they greeted us with warmth, a hot refresh towel to wipe our hands during check in, and then went through many of the details like the best areas to walk around for the views and sights. The additional drink coupons were the cherry on top (I only wish they had clearly noted beer or wine selection only). Maybe we just got super lucky with our staff but I think they are just trained exceptionally well. Don't bother reading a bunch about other hotels in the area, go here and you won't be disappointed. The location is a bit off the main drag but it's a nice walk in to the heart of entertaining pubs and restaurants. The beds could have a nice topper on them as well, but like seriously didn't matter much for our night's sleep.",5,2019,07,04
211,Great location,"Excellent location and spotless room with everything you,d want for a short stay, breakfast would keep you going for the day.A great location for matches (or concerts) in Croke Park. Had a room with a balcony which was excellent as the weather was good during our stay.",5,2019,07,04
211,An Excellent Modern Hotel,"Another great stay at the excellent Croke Park.

A very comfortable, clean hotel, great food and drinks as well as a great location. Staff were as always helpful, professional and happy to do whatever they can to make my stay as good as it could be. Highly recommended.",5,2019,07,03
211,Good Stay!,"I was in Dublin for a 2 week business trip and stayed at this hotel.

What I liked: The hotel is located in a quiet place next to river Liffey and also next to famous Croke park stadium; if you are staying on a day of the match you will see ocean of people enjoying at the hotel. The rooms were big and comfortable and the staff was very helpful. Close by to attractions, car rental, convenience store etc.

Recommendation: If you want a quite accommodation this definitely is the place to be and it is 20 mins away from the bustling temple bar area.",4,2019,07,03
211,Go Wexford!,"Happened to be staying the weekend of the hurling championship. Now I know what hurling is. The stadium is across the street and the hotel handled the fans and their enthusiasm excellently. Top notch staff, everyone was pleasant and helpful. Only negative was the bathroom sink and faucet - the sink was cracked and the faucet sprayed out at a 45° angle. Someone should have caught that before I did. ",4,2019,07,02
211,Poor staff interaction spoiled our stay,"The hotel is very nice, with comfortable rooms and a very good location for a Dublin City trip, but our trip was spoiled by how staff dealt with one of our group during a mix up over a breakfast booking. A minor glitch became blown up into a major blow-up at the desk, I ended up feeling a lovely stay was spoiled by some thoughtless and under-trained staff. Staff need some input as to how to deal with guests when there are glitches, do not treat your guests like they are wannabe petty criminals.",3,2019,06,30
211,"When in Dublin, stay here!","From the moment we came through the door, we were greeted with a smile.  Our room was immaculate and had everything we needed and more.  We spent our first 4 nights in Ireland here and decided to come back for our final night after traveling and before leaving the country.  It felt like we were coming ‘home’ and we just really looked forward to the very comfortable accommodations after traveling and staying in other hotels.  I’d definitely recommend this hotel.  It’s walking distance to many of the local sights and there’s a car rental place next door if you should need, as well as public transportation close by. ",5,2019,06,30
211,off beaten track excellent hotel,"This is north in the city not particularly close to most tourist attractions, but across the street from the hurling stadium.  Despite that it was a great hotel - nicely appointed room with very comfortable beds, great staff, excellent food and dining room.",5,2019,06,29
211,Metallica @ Slane Castle 2019,"I stopped at this hotel weekend Friday 7th June 2019 till Monday 10th June 2019. I went to see Metallica at Slane Castle on Saturday 8th June 2019 in County Meath. I had pre paid for a return coach from Dublin Quays to Slane Castle.

On arriving at the hotel the receptionist said I hadn't paid for my room which I had. I then showed her an email confirming this and she told me to forward it onto the hotel's email address which I did. I then upgraded to breakfast which wasn't included in what I paid for with lastminute.com for 42 Euros (14 Euros per night)

Once I checked in I got a bus from a couple of streets away to the center of Dublin to get myself some wellies for Slane Castle on the Saturday. The hotel give me a Do Dublin bus travel guide leaflet which I found helpful. I searched Sports Direct, Pennies and eventually got some wellies in Dunnes. I'm normally a size 8 mens shoe but after trying on a set of size 7 in store I found they fit me. I was able to get a meal inside of Dunnes before walking back on foot to the hotel.

On the Friday night I tried the bar out at the Croke Park and had a few pints of Guinness whilst watching the Republic Of Ireland play a qualifying match for Euro 2020 on RTE 2. I found the bar to be reasonable size with waitresses and waiters that served at tables etc.

On the Saturday the buffet breakfast filled me up for the big day at Slane Castle to see Metallica. The breakfasts included cereals, yogurts, toast, bacon, eggs etc and were buffet style help yourself.

I didn't get back to my hotel room till about 3am so breakfast on Sunday was something to look forward to.

On the Sunday morning I talked to a German guy who was a VIP promoter than stopped with Metallica at the top floor of some restaurant in Dublin. He told me he was going to all 25 European Metallica shows. He was sat at the breakfast table in the Croke Park hotel.

On the Sunday I went for a walk to the pubs in Dublin which had Gaelic Football on. Galway against Kilkenny was on in the pubs. There was also an all day breakfast cafe to try called Le Petit Breton that served french ale and french drinks as well as English and Irish breakfasts etc.

On the Monday I had to check out of the hotel at 12pm but I was able to leave my big 10KG suitcase with reception as I wasn't get my airport transfer till quarter to 6 on the evening.

I went for a walk had a breakfast at Le Petit Breton, went for a pint of Guinness at a couple of pubs then went to a McDonalds before going for a pint at Quinn's Drumcondra then back to the hotel. I picked my suitcase up around 5 in the afternoon and waited for my taxi.

The transfer people rang both me and the taxi driver to help one another find each other at the hotel. I found the staff to be very helpful, there was a beer garden where I had had a pint during the afternoon.",4,2019,06,28
211,Great hotel for visit to Ireland,This a wonderful hotel close the the Dublin center.  The price is reasonable and the staff is very helpful. I had a great time during my visit to Ireland. They assisted with my travel arrangements and needs.  The food was excellent as well.,5,2019,06,28
211,Perfect,"Great Hotel, great and friendly personal. Big TV. Clean rooms. Your are quick in the city by bus if you want. Was there with my girlfriend, we had nothing negative to say. We would take it again. Kepp going like this! :) ",5,2019,06,26
211,Fabulous,"Fabulous stay at The Croke Park.  Have stayed here a few times and it is consistently excellent.  The new design of the bar area is gorgeous.  We had delicious lunch and cocktails on arrival and all staff were friendly and helpful.  Breakfast the following morning was delicious and service was quick, friendly and attentive in spite of us coming at the busiest time!  Looking forward to my next stay already.",5,2019,06,26
211,Best hotel in Dublin,"The staff are so friendly, welcoming and helpful.
The standards of cleanliness and comfort are superb.
Easy access o the city centre. We would recommend a tour of Croke Park stadium.
Parking is easy and safe.",5,2019,06,26
211,Solid hotel,"Solid hotel for the price.  Short walking distance to downtown Dublin.  Excellent breakfast in the mornings and a nice bar for a drink at night.  Free on-site parking for guests.  Would recommend.  Rooms were clean, included a trouser press.",4,2019,06,24
211,The Hawthorn Restaurant,"We had a group dinner at Hawthorn Restaurant. The restaurant looks lovely with its art deco style. Facilities were clean. Service and food were very good. I ordered salmon for starter, hake for main and chocolate fondue for dessert.",5,2019,06,24
211,"Awesome room, staff, breakfast",Stayed for business and my husband came with me. My conference was across street and my husband loved tour of Croke Park. Amazing breakfast. Wonderful room/ shower. Housekeeping staff was tremendous! Easy 20 minute walk to Temple Bar. Highly recommend,5,2019,06,21
211,The staff was great,We just got back from 15 days in Europe and our first stop was in Dublin where we stayed at The Croke Park.  Looking back on our trip some of our fondest memories were with the staff at The Croke Park who were very accommodating and made us laugh.  Lorraine in the restaurant was very personable and friendly and made sure our needs were met.  I had lost my phone in a taxi one night and Jennifer at the front desk went above and beyond to try to help us locate the phone and when we did find it was as excited as we were.  All and all a great stay and I would recommend to my friends and family.,5,2019,06,21
211,Double 'celebration',"My daughter and I were travelling to celebrate two events.  A belated 60th birthday and a forthcoming graduation. We travel regularly to 4 and 5 star hotels. I have never had a check in like the one we had anywhere in the world.  A trainee who was unfriendly, surly, inefficient and extremely unwelcoming.  Had been promised a room with access to the executive lounge and possibly an upgrade in writing in April. Told we had neither as hotel was full.  This was first impression of the hotel. Eventually given room on 3rd floor with access. Told nothing about checkout times, where the lounge was, etc. On second morning the lounge was unattended, almost everything needing replenished, dirty cups and plates everywhere, hardly any plates or bowls. I had to phone on my own phone down to reception. Waited 10-15 minutes and waitress arrived and started to clear things away. Nothing replenished. My daughter went down to reception. A member of staff came up and loudly in front of guests said it was for guests on the 4th floor!  Did I know breakfast was downstairs? We were offered pancakes and for me one slice of French toast. We later spoke to Pascal, the Manager. She admitted it was a disappointment and during discussion said to leave out bags, come back for a meal to make up for it all or 'anything you want'.  I immediately said I wanted to leave and not really return. The lady at reception who spoke to us in lounge came to the hotel door to speak to us. Again she said prior to our flight at 8pm to leave bags, that she would organise a complimentary taxi to the airport and to have either a meal in the bar or a complimentary meal of three courses in the restaurant which she said was open from 5pm.  She said it was to make up for the negative experience in the lounge. She shook my hand and told me she'd take care of it all.  Reluctantly I left my bags, returned by taxi to the hotel from the Guinness Storehouse which we had limited time to spend (35 minutes) because of the waste of 90 minutes at 'breakfast '. We went to the restaurant. We did not order three courses, we did not order alcoholic drinks, we explained that it was at Pascal and the other manager's invitation.  We ordered a main course only and a bottle of water to share.  Not exactly taking advantage! Imagine our humiliation when the head waiter came to the table after our order to tell us that a message from Pascal that it is EITHER one course only OR a taxi.  But not both!  Then five minutes later the second waiter comes to the table to say it's only ONE course (which is what was ordered) and everything else ordered is to 'come out my pocket!'  At that we chose to leave the restaurant saying to cancel the order. I was not only angry, I was enraged!  However, it gets better.  The young concierge Sean saw how upset and angry I was and was the only one to deal with things. He immediately ordered a taxi and arranged for me to speak to Ian.  Ian saw just how humiliated I was made to feel.  Abbas (a Duty Manager) stood at reception with two young trainees and openly discussed the situation and laughing with the young women.  Again, extremely humiliating. When I asked him to say it directly to me instead of as if I wasn't there in front of him, he replied 'I'm done with this conversation' and left the desk.The taxi arrived and of course it was not the hotel paying but it had been arranged by the hotel for me to pay. Abbas came to the taxi and confirmed I was to pay cash.  Why, oh why, did staff promise that they would arrange and offer this and then it's even more humiliation to the customer than in the morning?  Foolishly I returned to the hotel in a taxi to be treated in this way by many members of staff. I wonder if male guests would have been treated in this way?  It certainly was a very bad stay from beginning to end and definitely not the double celebration I awaited.  My daughter and I were treated as though we were trying to get a free meal and taxi, neither of which I had requested at any time, but what had been promised by two managers to try to 'restore my impressions of Croke Park Hotel'.",1,2019,06,20
211,Nice Hotel,"Nice hotel, with friendly and helpful staff.  Rooms are clean and spacious.  The hotel is well located and in close proximity to the city center and the 3 Arena where we were at a concert. Would recommend this to other people and we will definitely be back.",5,2019,06,19
211,Perfectly comfortable stay near city centre,"My wife and I had a 2-night stay in the Croke Park Hotel. It is situated next to the largest stadium, but during our stay, there were no matches. Rooms were big with comfortable beds, water cooker, iron and even a (relatively small) bath tub. We had a good quality sleep and traditional irish breakfast. It is somewhat high in fat though, but it would be anywhere in Ireland. There were also other options like cereals, fruit, bread rolls & cheese etc. The gym was small but convenient, there were free towels, bottles of water and bathroom amenities. The staff were exceptionally friendly and helpful. And they even have a shuttle bus from the hotel to the great Hop-on Hop-off Bus tour that takes you over 2 hours through the city. It is best to discover Dublin, since the streets are full of busses and taxis, I would have hated to drive there myself. The bus drivers are also super helpful, friendly and have great sense of humour. Would recommend this hotel to anyone who is not on the lookout for a party location.",5,2019,06,16
211,Perfect Fit for Our Needs,"I have stayed in Dublin now a few times and have decided that The Croke is my go to place. I do not need a hotel to be perfect but attention to little details and thoughtfulness stands out.

Here are some some of things that I really appreciated about Croke Park-

Hot towel at check in after a long flight. 

Bottles of complimentary water at check out.

Dessert in room for anniversary.

A great turn down when we arrived at 10 am after flying, I booked an extra night early to be able to sleep and so they had the room ready for bed when we arrived. Superb! 

Breakfast included. 

Bed is comfy. This is important. 

Bathroom is updated and clean, robes are available and attention to conservation is requested. 

My only complaint, if you could call it that, would be to change up the breakfast buffet a tiny bit. It was standard fare which was good, and honestly they could do fine without changing it, but would also love some small add on each morning maybe a shooter or something of that nature. 

Overall,the value for what you get is a perfect balance. Staff is wonderful. 

",5,2019,06,15
211,As expected,"Right next to the stadium, this good hotel, about 15 minutes by taxi to the centre of town, depending traffic.

Spacious rooms, efficient staff, good breakfast selection. Probably not the hotel I would choose when on business trip, as lot of other hotels are in centre of town, but if you are on a holiday, or got lot of time, definitely fine. 

Large tv screen in bar area to watch games.

",4,2019,06,15
211,Quick Getaway,"We stayed at Croke Park as a last minute Bank Holiday Weekend Break. The reviews were good and the feedback regarding transport from airport to hotel via Trip Advisor were also very helpful. 
The hotel is ideally situated at a 20minute walk to Dublin City Centre. The hotel staff are very helpful, polite, well presented, could not fault any of them. The Concierges were also helpful & recommended the correct trips for our length of stay. There is no spa here as we thought, this is regularly mistaken with their sister hotel.  We had no problems with the Breakfast, there was plenty of choice and staff were always checking on the food, do not be put off by some reviews. Our room was a good size with good amenities, the bathroom even had a separate bath & shower, the shower wasn’t particularly powerful but done the job. We would stay here again & definitely recommend.",4,2019,06,10
211,Great great great just great,"Took mrs truth teller to Michael Buble in the 3 arena last night, we stayed in the Croker hotel.  Almost within touching distance of the stadium 😁.  We had a really enjoyable experience there.  The staff couldn't have been nicer, We stayed on the 4th floor and many thanks to the reception staff for arranging this for us👍🏼. Would happily stay here again (must be brilliant on a big game day).  One tiny point, I was hoping to see great hurling and football photos and memoribillia placed tactically around the bar and lobby's but this is a minor issue.  Thanks to all and hope to see you again 🇮🇪",5,2019,06,08
211,Using a rental car to explore Ireland?  Use Croke Park as your hub,"Along with exploring many fun spots in Dublin, I had interest in making several excursions to areas south & west in Ireland.
  
The Croke Park was ideal for my trip.  When I was exploring Dublin, the hotel provided very safe & free parking for my car, which was such a relief when visiting a new place for the first time.  When utilizing Ireland's excellent network of highways to Galway, Waterford & Cork, the Croke Park was never further than a few hours drive.  

It was a pleasure to stay there.  The breakfast package was worth the upgrade.  Coming down every morning to that comfortable dining room was a great way to start my day.  Rooms were clean and comfortable.  Any interaction with service staff or concierge was trouble-free.  

The neighborhood is less touristy than other hotels, but I liked having a little distance from the very congested Temple Bar area.  I walked one day from the hotel to Trinity College & it was an hour's walk.  Plenty of interesting shopping, dining & people watching along the way.

Without question, I would visit the Croke Park again.",5,2019,06,07
211,Another great experience in Croke Park Hotel,"Attention to detail , welcoming and professional staff combined with wonderful food make this my ""go to hotel"" when in Dublin. The recent renovations and new decor make this an even better social or business experience.",5,2019,06,07
211,Great Hotel,"Stayed here a few time now and the standard is always great. The room was comfortable and well equipped. The only very slight annoyance is I could not get the fan on the AC to turn off.
Food and bar as ever were great but it is the staff who really make this hotel. From checking in with Hayley on reception to all the staff in the bar and restaurant they are super friendly, always happy to help and a total credit to the hotel. 
Love staying here.",5,2019,06,07
211,Outstanding hotel,"Ist time here and from the moment we arrived to leaving it was superb.
Staff on check out friendly and professional.The room was amazing,  spotlessly clean and a great view of Croke Park stadium.
We decided to have food in the bar and what a pleasure,service outstanding and food very tasty. Be prepared for hotel prices though.
Big shout out to Lorraine in the bar , incredibly friendly and a pleasure to meet , brilliant attitude and great with children,  a box of chocolates for my daughter was the icing on the cake.
Beds incredibly comfortable and a wonderful selection of food at breakfast tbe following morning.
Top that off with more chocolates at check out and tben free parking, why stay anywhere else.",5,2019,06,06
211,Accommodating Staff,We needed an early check in as my husband was unwell and we were flying back to the US the next day.  The front desk quickly checked us in. The chief porter was nice enough to order our taxi the next day for the airport.  The dining staff were most accommodating and the food was just fine for me.  I would stay again without hesitation.,5,2019,06,04
211,Fantastic,Stayed here for one night and it was amazing the minute we arrived!! Staff were so friendly. It was my partners birthday and they upgraded our room and arrived with  prosecco to the room and a cake which was so nice!! We will definitely return here soon.,5,2019,06,04
211,Great rating and I can see why,"This hotel rates very highly among Dublin hotels and I can see why.  Parking is plenty and free upon validation of ticket.  Check in staff are friendly & efficient.  The room was large & spacious, as was the bathroom.  Twin room consisted of two double beds with such comfortable bedding, affording us a fantastic nights sleep.  Good quality bathroom products & towels.  No noise on corridors either late at night nor in morning.  
Ate in sideline bar in evening - it was a lite-bites / tapas menu. Lovely bar, comfortable seating - as a matter of fact there are lots of very nice areas in the hotel to just sit and have a drink or coffee while passing the time or people watching!
Breakfast was also good.  Nice buffet choice, food was fresh and hot.  Also options available to order such as poached eggs, French toast etc.
All in all and fantastic and faultless stay.  Would be more than happy to return and recommend.",5,2019,06,04
211,A great stay,Stayed here with friends for a concert which was on nearby. Our hotel stay was one of the best. The staff were very friendly especially the concierge who was so helpful and made us feel right at home.The room was clean and spacious. The breakfast was delicious this was included in our stay. There was a great choice to choose from. Would like to thank the young girl who also brought us up Prosecco and a desert plate as it was my birthday on the day we stayed. Overall great experience would definitely recommend.,4,2019,06,04
211,**Top Class and couldn’t be faulted**,I stayed here with my sister last weekend as it was my birthday. Staff were so friendly on arrival we were given a lovely warm welcome. Our room was beautiful spacious and clean and the beds were so comfortable. As my sister had mentioned it was my birthday there was a lovely surprise in the room of complementary Prosecco and cake. This was really special and such a lovely touch. We had a beautiful meal and drinks in the bar. The atmosphere was lovely and the staff were more that kind and helpful. Upon checking out we were given complementary bottles of water. The experience on a whole was just so pleasant and it was such a great way to spend my birthday weekend. Thank you so much we will definitely be back. ,5,2019,06,03
211,Pleasant Stay,"Greeted by pleasant staff.
Asked if there was any availability of a free upgrade and was told we'd been given an upgrade to a Queen room with a single bed, I said I'd paid for a Kingsize Double room, showed her my booking - she replied with ""yes that's what you've been given"", I wasn't convinced and upon entering the room we had been given a queen and single! I rang down and was moved to ""2 doors up to room 340"". So we hadn't been upgraded, she had actually tried to down-grade my booking!?? I wasn't pleased. But room 340 was what I'd paid for!?
The room was clean, warm, well equipped and with nice linen - bathroom was good with very nice towels/toiletries.
Staff pleasant.
Carpark good and free to residents.
Didn't have breakfast in-house went up the street (Castle Tea Room) €7 each. 
Would recommend. 
Thank you.

211,Trip to Croke Park,"I stayed in the Croke Park hotel as it was convenient to the Mater Hospital, where I had an appointment the following morning. The room we stayed in was convenient to the lifts, as requested. The room was spotless, very comfortable and very quiet. Breakfast, as usual, was amazing.",5,2019,06,01
211,Great hotel,"Stayed for one night while attending a concert nearby, staff were friendly and helpful. Check in was great thanks to the lovely young man on reception. He was so helpful and made us feel very welcome. The room was clean and spacious. The late checkout was great however the cooked breakfast was a let down for a hotel with such high standards but it was included in the stay. The fresh fruit, juices and pastries were delicious.",4,2019,06,01
211,Great service,"Stayed here on multiple occasions for examinations held in Croke Park. Other than the location being convenient, the staff are always pleasant and the car parking in city centre Dublin is an added bonus. ",5,2019,06,01
211,Would Stay Here Again In A Heartbeat!!,"This hotel certainly knows how to treat their customers!  Everyone from the front desk staff, to the concierge, to the cleaning staff were incredibly friendly, helpful and always went out of their way to make you feel welcome.  The room was extremely clean and had all the amenities you could possibly need.  We only stayed here one night, but we were wishing we had more time here.  You will not be disappointed to book here.",5,2019,05,31
211,Croke Park Hotel Restaurant,"Whilst on a week long business trip to Ireland Indifferent hotels, this is a stands tall amongst them all. A great hotel with an exquisite restaurant. The staff here really take their jobs seriously resulting in a blemish free dining experience. Really fantastic restaurant food and amazing staff/waiters .... dumbfounded!",5,2019,05,30
211,Great stay at The Croke Park Hotel,"We stayed in Dublin 2 nights and The Croke Park was excellent.  I have 0 complaints, except the pillows.  I had a hard time getting to sleep because of the pillows.  I didn't ask for a different one, because the first night I was so tired and the next night I forgot.
The hotel was very tastefully decorated and very clean; both very important to me!  I am ultra picky and I was very satisfied with our stay.  ",5,2019,05,29
211,What a great find !,"From the time we checked in ,until the time we left, this place checked all the boxes. The front desk was helpful with all our questions. The room was clean and bright. The restaurant/pub was new and the food was exceptional. We couldn't have been happier to stay here.",5,2019,05,26
211,A wonderful Stay ...The Best Staff Ever!,"Stayed at the Croke Park whilst working for a week in Dublin.

Cannot recommend this hotel highly enough....
The hotel is beautiful, but what really makes this hotel are the amazing staff that work there.

One disappointment I have to say is the lack of vegan food available here.  There wasn't one dish on the menu for lunch which was vegan....so I couldn't eat here although I would have if it would have been available.  For breakfast however, the chefs made me some gorgeous mushrooms and avocado with sour dough toast, which was arranged by the wonderful Aaron, he was amazing and nothing was too much trouble for him.

Hannah in the restaurant was also fabulous, and again couldn't do enough for you.

Sean the concierge and Jannary and Jennifer on reception were just brilliant and nothing was too much trouble for these girls.  Jannary went above and beyond her duties to make sure I was well looked after!  I cannot thank her enough.

If you are looking for a gorgeous hotel, 15 mins from Dublin City Centre with amazing staff, the look no further than Croke Park.

Thank you everybody so much for making my staff so fab!!",5,2019,05,26
211,Great Experience ,The employees were extremely nice and the rooms were clean and comfortable. The breakfast was fantastic and the vibe of the hotel was very welcoming. We plan on staying there again! About a 20 minute walk to the city. Highly recommended. ,5,2019,05,25
211,Our stay at Croke Park in Ireland,Great place and good value in central Dublin just a short drive to downtown attractions. Hotel facilities and staff were first rate  and food was fantastic. We will definitely stay here again on our next trip to Ireland. ,5,2019,05,23
211,Relaxing visit to Ireland,"we greatly enjoyed the staff and hotel. the room was large and clean with a large bathroom .the room is quiet and come with a comfy bed. we did not use the restaurant as the prices were a little on the high side, and instead enjoyed several of the local restaurants in Dublin. ",5,2019,05,21
211,Perfect location,"This hotel is around a 20 min walk from the centre of Dublin and is literally across the road from Croke Park stadium.
The room was modern and well furnished with a large flat screen TV opposite the bed - most of the SKY channels fully included as well.
Didn't spend any time at the bar or have time for breakfast, but the reception area was well equiped for business travellers.
I also must commend the hotel for allowing me an early check in time at 11am without a fee.",4,2019,05,18
211,Awesome service! ,"Had a wonderful stay at the Crowe Park Hotel! Our meal in the restaurant was delicious and our server, Michael, was amazing! He was so friendly and helpful! Very attentive and the food was great! Can’t wait to go back! 
Thank you to Michael and all of the staff for their exceptional service! ",5,2019,05,17
211,Dublin Hotel,"The Croke Park Hotel in Dublin is an excellent option, it is close to the centre of the city, convenient for the airport and the M50 with an onsite car park. The hotel has a small gym and a very good bar/restaurant available. Would highly recommend.",5,2019,05,16
211,Amazing hotel,"We loved our stay at the Croke Park Hotel. Our trip to Dublin got off to a rocky start as our original booking at a different hotel had fallen through at short notice, but the Croke Park Hotel were amazing and found us a room at very short notice. The staff were friendly and the facilities were amazing. It's a great hotel in a good location- easily walkable to the city centre and very close to the Drumcondra train station. 

Particularly thanks to Ian who checked us in and helped us when we were panicking about having nowhere to stay!",5,2019,05,10
211,Exceeded Expectations,"Just loved this hotel from the moment of our arrival. Welcoming, helpful and interested staff. Our room  was spacious and  modern, with  lovely  bathroom and excellent toiletries. 
Easy and safe parking. We chose it for easy access to the airport for an early morning flight and it exceeded our expectations.  Would definitely stay here again rather than at any of the airport hotels.",5,2019,05,09
211,Great Hotel,"OK, It is a walk out of town, but it is RIGHT NEXT TO CROKE PARK. Lovely recently updated hotel, Nice, Modern, but retaining the older elegance of the building.
Great Rook, Everything you need, Superb Breakfast",5,2019,05,07
211,Extremely comfortable stay in Dublin,"We needed a hotel close to the airport for one night in Dublin after having stayed with friends in South Dublin for a few nights.  The hotel room met all of my expectations - comfortable, warm and clean.  Amenities in the bathroom were from The White Company.  My only (very minor) gripe about the room is that I would have preferred fresh milk and a coffee maker - but other than that, i had no concerns,  The reception staff were extremely welcoming and helped with any information that we needed.  The buffet breakfast was fine - well cooked substantial Irish fare - I stay at a lot of hotels and I would rate it as average compared that that offered by similarly rated hotels.  The location of the hotel, directly opposite Croke Park, was convenient for the airport but it is not in a particularly attractive part of Dublin and you need to take public transport (or a brisk walk) to go into the centre. That said, we walked back from our restaurant at 10-ish and the area felt safe enough.  Probably not recommended if you want to be close to the city centre, but for a short-stay near to the airport, then this is definitely a good option.",5,2019,05,07
211,"Lovely Hotel, Far From Downtown","My husband had a conference at the Croke Park Hotel, and so we booked a room for the week. The hotel was very clean and comfortable with a good restaurant and bar in the building. Staff was very helpful and friendly.  The only down side was that it was at least a 10 euro taxi ride to go anywhere. It is also not in a very walkable neighborhood with very few restaurant options in a walkable distance.  The hotel gets a 5 out of 5 stars, The neighborhood gets a 3 out of 5.",4,2019,05,05
211,Friendly and very comfortable,"We used this hotel as a base for a long weekend to celebrate a special birthday. The hotel was aware of the celebration and treated us exceptionally well - upgrade to executive level and a birthday cake on arrival. The bed was very comfortable, the room really clean, the staff (without exception) are incredibly friendly. It is a 30 minute walk to the centre - but we knew this when we booked and don’t mind walking. For runners there is a great run along the canal just by the hotel - you can pretty much run as far as you want - the canal path goes on for miles.

My wife is coeliac and the restaurant was tremendously helpful, cooking her a gluten-free breakfast to ensure no possible cross-contamination.

If I had any constructive feedback it would be two elements of breakfast. 1. The plates were not very hot and the cooked food went cold very quickly. 2. The coffee is very weak. Neither of these are worth knocking a star off, but I raise this in the event that the hotel reads the reviews.

If I come back to Dublin I would stay here again.",5,2019,05,05
211,Warning. Check your bank account for multiple holds on account that are not released,"This place has went downhill with whoever is in charge now . This is my third time visiting the Croke Park Hotel and will be the last. I am currently in dispute with Croke Park hotel as they made have 2 further holds on my debit card account. One for the room again and one for food , drink. Both which were paid for upon checkout but on another transaction. 

3 times i was asked for my card as they needed to put a hold on which explains why there is 2 payments pending in my account which i cannot access. Having spoken to Danske Bank they agreed that Croke Park need to release this and they gave me the authorisation code of the 2 further strange holds . All Croke park has to do is email back the bank with my details and the authorisation codes to have these 2 holds released.

Unfortunately their ""system"" only shows 1 payment which i am not disputing as that was the bill paid upon checkout , so i advise anybody to actually check their bank to see if there is indeed more holds and be aware if they keep asking for a card to make a hold .

i was asked for my card for a hold when i originally booked which is perfectly normal , then once again when we arrived i was asked for my card for a hold and i expressed my concerns then. Furthermore i was asked for it again when i ordered drinks at the bar and was informed they would need to place a hold which was very suspect.

This explains the 2 holds i have sitting with my bank at the minute and unfortunately i am now at a loss .

as i say i have stayed twice previously and it was good . However this time nothing was plain sailing as we hit the language barrier a few times as English is not a few staff members first language. Also breakfast was cold and inattentive,  but to be honest my dinner was very nice .

It certainly was a noticeable change from previous times and not in a good way.",3,2019,05,03
211,Treated Like Royalty! Fabulous Stay! We will be back,"Stayed here in April with my family for one night as our daughter was playing in a tournament in Croke Park.

From check in to check out we were treated like royalty.  All the staff - and I mean ALL the staff went over and above what was expected in terms of service. 

Our room was spacious and comfortable.  We dined in the hotel for dinner and breakfast - food was all great and very good value. 

What makes the hotel exceptional is the service that the staff give.  When we arrived to check in the reception staff made a big fuss of our daughter and congratulated her on her sporting achievements. 

When we then arrived in the room the hotel had left some lovely personalised touches for both my girls that made them feel like absolute superstars.  

As a 10 year old playing in Croke Park is a BIG DEAL, and they way in which all the hotel staff treated our daughter reinforced this.

Thank you so much for helping to contribute to such lovely memories for our family.  We will be back!",5,2019,05,02
211,PERFECT STAY!,We visited the hotel with our daughter and checked in very early. The staff accommodated us in a comfortable room for the 3 of us and helped a lot in all the arrangements. Room was nice as well as the breakfast. Nice facilities including car park. Will surely go back..,5,2019,05,01
211,Croke Park Hotel didnt disappoint but breakfast needs improving,"Overall stay at hotel was excellent - staff very friendly, hotel clean and modern. I didnt have dinner there but did have breakfast the following morning - arrived for breakfast about 9:45 and was a bit disappointed by the quality of some of the food - looked like it had been sitting there for quite a while - eggs were clearly there for a while and rubbery. Asked for spelt bread but there was no option  for that. Suspect if I had breakfast earlier it would have been better quility - but still small things like this matter when paying top dollar. Have stayed in sister hotel river lee in cork several times and breakfast is always outstanding. all in all minor complaint for an otherwise good stay.",4,2019,04,28
211,Comfortable stay,"We stayed 5 nights at Croke Park while enjoying Dublin and other sights in Ireland.
Pros:
1. Very clean and replenished toiletries, coffee supplies and daily bottles of water
2. January at the front desk was helpful and friendly, made us feel welcome and the check in process was very smooth
3. The bed is extremely comfortable and perfect for a good night's sleep
4. We were on the first floor with a view to the back of the hotel, so it was calm and quiet
5. Krish at Concierge was so polite and helpful and understands the value of good customer services

Cons:
1. The location is right across Croke Park stadium, so it is out of the city centre and takes at least 25 minutes to walk to the heart of all the action in Dublin. The closest bus stop is still a 10 minute walk, so most nights after a long day of touring, we were forced to take a taxi back to the hotel from the city centre. Taxi cost between EUROS 10-12 and can add easily add up as Uber is not permitted in Dublin.
2. One night, we ordered in room dining. It was super expensive given the bland taste of the food and the small portion. Very poor value for money.",4,2019,04,27
211,Perfect place to stay for ALI 2019,"Perfectly located right next to Croke Park Stadium. It is a 20 minute walk to Dublin city centre. The room was very spacious, quiet and clean. Room service is excellent. Water & coffee capsules were refilled several times a day. Breakfast includes everything you could wish for. The gym is open 7 x 24 h.",5,2019,04,27
211,Wonderful hotel with the best customer service!,"We stayed at Croke Park for 6 nights while visiting Dublin with our two kids. This is one of the best hotels we have stayed at. The staff was very caring and professional. The room was very comfortable, quiet and clean. The breakfast was very good! We would highly recommend this hotel.",5,2019,04,25
211,"Beautiful hotel, recently redone.","We stayed the first 2 nights of our Ireland trip. I had been told that the hotels in Europe were small and old and while that was ok I was genuinely surprised and happy when I saw the Croke Park. It was beautiful, modern, and our room was clean and large. Our room was not ready so we had a drink and some food in their beautiful lounge. The staff was friendly and explained how tipping (or not) works in Ireland and was very honest and helpful. I love that they make a livable wage and don't live on their tips like they do in the US and therefore you only tip if the service is exceptional which it often was. That takes a lot of stress off a traveler.
Anyhow we had breakfast there both days which was delicious (an Irish buffet) and dinner one night.
I had the cod and my husband had the rib eye. The food was done perfectly and was reasonably priced though the ambiance was upscale. With 2 drinks it came to just under $70.",5,2019,04,25
211,Excellent Hotel,"We spent two nights at the Croke Park Hotel and really enjoyed the amenities.  The food in the restaurant was excellent.  
It is located away from city center, but is within walking distance of the closest bus stop.  If you are depending on the bus system to return to the hotel, the last one out that way boards at 5:30 in the afternoon.",5,2019,04,24
211,Maintaining standards,"I spent a Sunday night recently in the Croke Park hotel and was very impressed with the recent revamp. It looks fantastic and dinner in the newly revamped lounge area was top class. As always, the staff were friendly, courteous and welcoming,  all under the watchful eye of Sean. It’s always an enjoyable experience to stay in the Croke Park and difficult to find a similar hotel of this standard with the same high level of service. Keep doing what you do so well!",5,2019,04,23
211,The nicest of the hotels we stayed in in Ireland,"This hotel was a great choice.  Clean with big rooms and big bathrooms.  The shower was immaculate and big.  The lobby area was updated and nice.  The staff were friendly.  The parking was free.  We found a lot of cute little places to eat around the area and it was only a 15 minute walk to the hop-on/hop-off bus tour we did.  We ate at the restaurant at the hotel one night.  The ambience was amazing, it was a little pricey though.  Only complaint is that I couldn't find vending machines and they didn't seem to have a little area to purchase snacks or drinks.",5,2019,04,23
211,"Great staff, good food ",Went with the family. Food was good. Not a lot of choice on the kids menu. I had snitzel which was good. Wife had soup which she didn't like. Kids devoured their fish & burgers. Staff were really nice. We ate outside on the terrace and really enjoyed it. ,4,2019,04,23
211,Definitely our favourite hotel,"We visited The Croke Park Hotel over Easter & can honestly say it has the most helpful, nicest staff we have ever experienced a special mention for Hannah on reception although the staff who were on hand at breakfast & in the lounge bar were amazing as well. The food was gorgeous & the decor & rooms were fantastic ( we stayed in The Liam McCarthy suite ). Needless to say we will definitely be back. Enjoyed every minute of our stay.",5,2019,04,23
211,Lovely Stay,"My partner and I arrived early to the hotel (around 10am) and were able to check in early, since they had a room available, this was also at no extra charge.  Very much appreciated after an early flight and only 3hrs sleep!

The staff at the hotel were excellent and couldn't do enough for us.  I have a severe peanut allergy and have airborne reactions - this is not something I would usually tell a hotel.  Whilst enquiring about breakfast, the lovely man on reception asked if my allergy was airborne (genuinely never been asked this before) and said they would stop serving peanuts with drinks in the bar for the duration of our stay.  Small gestures like this make all the difference.  I don't like making a fuss about my allergy, but to have staff who appreciate the seriousness and do their best to ensure your comfort and safety really is refreshing - so thank you for that!

The hotel room was spacious and the bed was so comfortable!!!  My partner and I slept really well for the duration of our stay.  The room was also clean and had everything you would need - safe, hairdryer, iron, tv, etc.

Location - a little further out of the centre of Dublin.  It took us about 20mins to get to the Temple Bar area of the city.  However the distance is reflected in the price (rooms closer to the centre are much more expensive!)  The hotel also has a car park that you can use free of charge (we asked about this but ended up not renting a car).

Overall, we couldn't fault the hotel or the staff and we really enjoyed our 3 days in Dublin.  I wouldn't hesitate to recommend this hotel.",5,2019,04,23
211,Lovely hotel,"A group of us visited this lovely hotel. Rooms are lovely, complimentary bottle of wine in each room was a nice touch. Beds were sooooo comfy!! Lovely fast running bath with the White Company complimentary products in the bathroom. Breakfast was amazing with lots to choose from and enough to suit every need. Hotel bar was big and did a wide range of drinks and good wine. This is the best hotel I’ve visited in a long while. Shame it’s not a bit more central to the shops/bars but only a 20 minute walk or short taxi ride. ",5,2019,04,21
211,Nice stay,"The hotel is not far from the bus stop to / from the airport. Ticket is euro 6. is within walking distance to the city, about 20 minutes. Not far from trainstation with good connection to Howth (euro 6.25 return) and Belfast.",5,2019,04,21
211,Croke park hotel,From booking to departure a top class service. Free goodies for kids as easter special. Breakfast fresh and a wide variety of tasty food to set you up for the day. Free parking allowed us to drop off the car and bus /walk around the city very easily. Will definitely be back,5,2019,04,20
211,Recommend ,"Lovely hotel to stay when visiting Dublin a short cab ride to centre of town or hop on the tour bus at 1030am ! Rooms comfortable , food good staff friendly cost reasonable for a city hotel . Only problem we had was with the serving staff at breakfast on the first day who were so slow better on second day overall a great visit ",5,2019,04,20
211,Tremendous Hotel but a little bit out of the way,"You will definitely enjoy a stay here as the rooms, dining area, service are all top notch. The bathrooms are lovely with great water pressure and the tv channel our extensive. The beds were very comfortable with some of the best pillows in Ireland.  You should know though it is a decent cab ride to temple bar, trinity etc.  If you aren't driving that can add up.  Perfect hotel for a big game though as it is steps from Croke.",4,2019,04,18
211,Lovely hotel,"Stayed for a concert recently. Hotel 15 minute walk from city centre. We were welcomed by a concierge on arrival and our bags taken from the taxi. Reception staff were so accommodating and helpful. My brother had organised a free upgrade and chocolates to be sent to our room. The bedroom was beautiful. Large double bed and single bed. Crisp clean sheets, comfortable mattress, and cosy duvets. 
We didn’t have the breakfast but dining area and bar looked lovely. Only thing that would have made the hotel even better would have been a swimming pool as I had 2 children with me.
Will definitely be back to stay.",5,2019,04,18
211,Had a great time in Ireland!,"We loved this hotel! The rooms were clean and spacious. The food was delicious and the bar/restaurant was beautifully decorated. The staff was warm, welcoming and so helpful. We would definitely stay here again.",5,2019,04,15
211,Great Hotel but Far from City Center,Recently we stayed at the Croke Park hotel in Dublin. This hotel was VERY nice and the staff were great! Only downside was the location. It was directly across the street from the stadium but the area did not seem like the best. Plus it was farther from the city center then we thought. We had to take cabs a lot more than we would have liked because of the location. I also wish there was a cafe in the lobby to get a quick coffee and bite to eat because there is nothing else nearby.,4,2019,04,15
211,Date Night,"Had date night in the bistro restaurant, was served by Arthur, Felippe and another gentleman I believe was called OT, beautiful service and was well looked after. Drinks and food were much better quality than you would usually find in hotel restaurant and the new restaurant out the back is the perfect setting for a romantic meal. Would definitely recommend. The bar is also a nice place to relax afterwards and the staff really make sure you feel welcome and looked after.",5,2019,04,13
211,Jas,"Excellent service and staff. Good atmosphere, clean. Recommend to families and friends and all.very convenient to go around city . Very lively bar , restaurant The Side Line. Traditional Irish music in bar.",5,2019,04,13
211,Friendly staff,"I often stay here for work. The staff has always been amazing. The rooms are clean and comfortable. I usually go out for dinner, but last time I ate at the hotel's restaurant. The quinoa crusted salmon was delicious! Perfectly cooked and seasoned! We were served by Michael, who was very friendly and personable. Michael and Caelyn (I am probably misspelling her beautiful Irish name) took the time to talk to me a little bit about Irish culture and language. I really appreciate that they were open to my curious questions. Their friendliness definitely made a great experience even better.",5,2019,04,13
211,Friendly and comfortable hotel,"The Croke hotel is a friendly, comfortable and safe hotel to stay in Dublin.  It’s not a 5 star hotel by any means, but it’s a good hotel. The rooms were ascetically pleasing and clean. It Is located outside the main city area.  You need to get public transportation or taxi.  We ended up taking taxis which is a 10 min. ride to the hart of the city.  Taxis drivers seem fair in pricing and they’re usually knowledgeable of the history of Ireland and point of interest to see.  There is a convenience store about 5 min. walk. ",4,2019,04,11
211,Amazing Hotel,"Fabulous hotel,
Lovely rooms with complimentary chocolates for Easter. 
The staff could not do enough for us so friendly and welcoming.
Great location.
From the moment we stepped through the door it was magical.",5,2019,04,09
211,Nice comfortable vibe and great staff,"Just stayed a night for work. All staff exemplified good customer service. Hotel has a nice buzz about it, on the north side, but don't let that put you off if you are not familiar with Dublin. For a mid-week stay while I was attending a conference at Croke Park over the road, it was a  very pleasant experience.",5,2019,04,09
211,Super All round.,Excellent Hotel - super place to stay.. staff extremely helpful & very friendly. Great food- Breakfast fabulous and as were meals taken in Bar. Room very comfortable & clean.  Car parking facilities  very good.  Highly recommend this hotel.,5,2019,04,08
211,Pleasant stay,"Room is reasonable, it is modern just don't expect a massive room (you are paying for the convenience of being close to the city).
The concierge was extremely helpful and the food at the restaurant was excellent!!!",4,2019,04,06
211,Amazing service,"This is my second stay at croke park for business, both have been thoroughly enjoyable. Beds are very comfy, rooms and hotel are very clean and the breakfast is to die for. They have a small gym which is an added bonus as well. Slightly away from the town centre so for a longer break might get a bit tired from walking but overall a lovely, good value place to stay",4,2019,04,04
211,"Excellent, service, location, staff","I stayed here recently for work, hotel was excellent, good service, staff were excellent, good service, facilities, cleanliness.  I would definitely recommend and a stone throw from Croke Park which was great for me. ",5,2019,04,04

",5,2019,04,03
211,"Great experience of staff, room and facilities","Really nice staff, great atmosphere in the bar & at breakfast. Lovely room & very clean. Good location- close enough to walk to city centre. Free parking even for a few hours after check-out. A little pricey but worth it. Would definitely stay here again and recommend to friends and family.",5,2019,04,02
211,Welcoming hotel in a great location,"We stayed at The Croke Park on our last night in Ireland. Because we had an early flight, we wanted to be north of the city but with easy access to the city and to the airport. 

The hotel staff were all very friendly and helpful, and the room was lovely. We walked in to the city which took us about 30 minutes, and took at taxi back at the end of the evening which was less than €10.",5,2019,03,28
211,Breakfast is shoking,"the room and bar - we had dinner there - is fine nothing special.
if you don't have all morning, don't have breakfast because we wait for it 45 min.
it was not busy and we arrived 6.35, from there all goes down hill. 
average continental, we ordered omelette and eggs Florentine. it was not eatable just for the garbage.
it was my second time staying at this hotel and after this experience never will again.
complaint at the hotels questionnaire and no replay from the management",3,2019,03,25
211,Excellent Staff,"Stayed here for one night to attend an event in the city. We were impressed, it was nicer than we expected to be honest. The room was big, well decorated and clean (the same for the bathroom). Really nice bar near reception. The main thing that impressed us overall was just how friendly and helpful every single person working there we encountered was, really great to see and they are all a credit to the hotel. Will stay again for sure.",4,2019,03,25
211,Friendly and comfortable hotel.,"Good location only about a 20 minute walk into the city centre.Quick transfer to and from the airport on the number 700 bus.The bus stop is about only 5 minutes walk away from hotel.
Reception staff very friendly and helpful.",4,2019,03,24

211,REFURBISHMENT - AS WELCOMING AS EVER,"We visited the Croke Park Hotel as a family over St Patrick's Weekend and were treated like royalty.......as everyone else is, who chooses to stay there!   We were totally amazed at the fabulous refurbishment which took place over the past couple of months in the restaurant and bar areas.  Mr Sean Reid (Deputy General Manager) met us in reception and was absolutely delighted to be our tour guide of the newly refurbished areas.  WOW!  Such grandeur and finesse!  We were blown away by the sheer luxury and opulence of this refurb!   Siobhan (Front of House Operations Manager) ensured that she was on hand to greet us with her ever-endearing charm and warm personality.....as with Sean, she never fails to impress us with her friendly greeting and banter.  We were treated to the most delightful check-in with the lovely receptionist Caitriona.  Her courteousness is to be admired and super super efficient in every way, ensuring that everything was in order for our weekend stay for each of our family members.  Nadia (Reception Manager) also was on hand and again like the other members of Staff had the most friendly and warm-hearted welcome for us.  No doubt the Croke park Hotel must be very proud of their Managers and Receptionists....undoubtedly true ambassadors for this fabulous hotel.  With this being our umpteenth time to say in the Croke Park Hotel we knew our way about and were greeted by many more friendly Staff faces over the weekend.
We had the pleasure of dining in the restaurant over the two evenings and again were cordially greeted by Pascale and Lori, both of whom ensured that our culinary delights were served with the warmest hospitality.  Food as always, was top-knotch and the fact that we were dining in the luxury of the refurbishment made it even more special.
And would you believe we had an even greater surprise in store for us on Saturday evening.....Tyrone beating the Dubs!!!!!  All in all it was a wonderful weekend so many thanks to Sean and all his efficient Staff for ensuring that our stay in the Croke Park Hotel was another memorable one.  Looking forward to our next visit.",5,2019,03,21
211,Great Service; Helpful Staff,"I stayed at the Croke Park Hotel on business for three weeks. My entire time there was a good experience. The staff was able to help me workout payment concerns between my business and their payment. 

Ask for the very handsome front desk associate, Lorenzo. He was the sweetest thing who handled my issues professionally and with compassion.",5,2019,03,19
211,Excellent hotel,"Met at registration desk with a smile. Even though the hotel was under renovation the staff were outstanding. They were very responsive and willing to help in any way.
The restaurant was a little small due to the renovation that was going on but everyone appeared to be served in a timely manner. The hotel is right across from the Croke Stadium.",5,2019,03,19
211,Excellent ,"Booked a long weekend for my wife’s birthday which fell over St Patrick’s weekend. 

Staff were all extremely pleasant and hotel room was excellent. They even gave my wife’s complimentary cake for her birthday! 

When my 4 year old was sick in the restaurant at breakfast there was no issues and everyone was very nice about it.

Yes the bar got very busy on games at the stadium but there was a residents lounge on the 4th floor which was very nice. 

Thanks for a great weekend ",5,2019,03,19
211,"Overcrowded, Cannot Recommend.","Booked Crokepark Hotel, for a nice getaway to Dublin. Hotel is right opposite a huge stadium. Completely dominates it and gives no views of any of Dublin. Hotel is absolutely overrun when football matches are on. Lobby and bars, full of people drinking and standing everywhere - nowhere to sit down or relax. Place was dirty with glassware left around. It cannot cope with number of people. Felt trapped and tried to go out but all local roads were closed to access.  We would not stay at this hotel.",1,2019,03,18
211,Quality hotel,"we had a conference in the nearby Croke Park stadium, so the hotel's location was very convenient for me. Quality of service and the hotel itself were excellent, no complaints. The staff at the reception, bar and breakfast lounge were very helpful, efficient and friendly. Infrastructure, amenities and so on were of high quality and the room was very quiet.

No complaints here.",5,2019,03,18
211,"A good choice if you are a GAA fan, but not if you want to visit Dublin","I booked this hotel more than a year upfront, knowing that St Patrick WE is a busy week end. The hotel is just opposite one of the entrances from Croke park stadium. It is about a 20 minutes walk to old Dublin, just south of the river Liffey. During game days the complete area around the hotel is not authorized for traffic, including taxi`s. Many fans, who are hotel guests but also many other, gather in the hotel lobby and public areas before, after and during half time. It is not funny. It is overcrowded, very noisy and the toilets are dirty. Also be aware that the restaurant is only offering a game day menu with a rather limited choice. The facilities offered by the hotel are meeting the expectations for this type of hotel. The rooms are comfortable, bedding is good. There is a safe deposit box in the room. Acoustic insulation is optimum. I found 2 long black hairs in the bathroom upon my check in",4,2019,03,18
211,Disappointed,"Our room and bathroom were very clean and comfortable.

The choice of food in the Bistro was quite limited, presumably due to a refurbishment of the kitchen.  We paid for an executive room - in retrospect a standard would have been better value for money.  The executive lounge advertised drinks and snacks being available all day.  These consisted of soft beverages, hot beverages, biscuits and fruit so was very limited compared to other hotels.  We were given vouchers for one alcoholic drink per day from the downstairs bar.",4,2019,03,17
211,Old Friends Together,"We had a fantastic time,we were celebrating 2 milestone birthdays would recommend the hotel to all our friends,staff very great especially Conor the waiter in the bar, who made the night explaining all the various flavours in the cocktails. Breakfast was very good, would certainly book again in the future.",5,2019,03,16
211,Perfect ,"When we arrived at around ten o clock on a Tuesday night we were greeted by a very pleasant and helpful receptionist.
We were advised that they were undergoing some renovations and that it would not effect our stay, and to be fair we would not of noticed if he had not of said.
Clean, friendly, great rooms and super breakfast! 
We will be back 👍",5,2019,03,13
211,Wonderful hotel across from Croke Park,Lovely room but most of all Exceptional staff! Caitriona went out of her way for us! After an overnight flight and traveling for 18 hours she quickly got us a room and personally tracked us down to give us the key since we had to wait 30 minutes for the room to be cleaned! She was so pleasant and even apologized to us for having to wait! She is wonderful and so is all the staff we encountered! I am so happy we will be staying there prior to leaving Ireland as the hotel is quiet and tucked away from downtown! Kudos to the staff! Will definitely stay there again next trip!,5,2019,03,11
211,Great Hotel,"Lovely hotel that will be even nicer when the work they are doing is finished.
Had one small issue but the hotel staff and quality makes up for that.
Free car parking is a nice touch. Will definitely be back.",4,2019,03,10
211,"4 Star with 5 Star level of service, comfort, cleanliness and professional friendly staff.","Stayed earlier this week as a couple. Having stayed previously we can confirm that once again this hotel really lived up to our expectations. On both occasions we had access to the Executive Lounge  which afforded a pleasant level of comfort with the amenities offered, including a very varied and fresh Continental Breakfast selection. From check-in to departure all the staff we encountered were friendly, efficient and always seemed ready to go that extra step to make guests feel at home. As would be expected the room facilities were excellent, including the welcome gift of Butlers Chocs, together with an offer of complimentary drinks for both. Also great to see that the in-room products were Irish sourced, where possible. Not at all difficult to see why all guest rate this property so highly. An added bonus for a city centre hotel is the free parking for guests.",5,2019,03,09
211,Three chilaxing days in Dublin.,"I really enjoyed my stay in the Croke Park Hotel. The atmosphere especially on Sunday before and after the camogie was special.
The lady who checked me in on Thursday is a top professional and a real asset to your team.
The staff at breakfast were also well on top of their game and delivered a excellent service.
Throughout my stay staff were welcoming,helpful and very professional.
My room was perfect. The quality of the bed, matress, linen and especially the pillows all four of them were top class.
I like the feature on the lift where you can only access the floors using your room key card.
Other guests were very much at home and at ease in the hotel's comfortable and secure atmosphere.",5,2019,03,08
211,Short break,"Rooms were very clean and well presented. Staff were very helpful. I had requested early check in for 10am. I was informed they would try to accommodate my request but could not promise availability of this, however I would be able to leave bags with concierge if room was not available. When I arrived at 9am my room was available.",5,2019,03,07
211,Excellent customer service,"I really feel I have to write this short review because Pascale who works in the bar/restaurant at the hotel really does go the extra mile. From offering to fetch a newspaper to excellent recommendations on the menu, I really was made to feel welcome. Merci beaucoup Pascale!",5,2019,02,27
211,Croke Park Hotel,Croker is convenient to the city and the airport.  Great vibe in the hotel and staff is very friendly. Very comfortable rooms and great stay had.  front desk greeted you with a warm towel which was great after along trip.  In room dining was great food good ,5,2019,02,26
211,Great stay in a lovely hotel,"We are a family of 4 people- 2 adults and 2 children. 
Car parking facilities at the hotel are excellent. Lots of car parking spaces and they are quite spacious.
We were welcomed by a very friendly receptionist. Check in was a quick and straight forward process. 
Our room was warm, clean and cosy. The bathroom was excellent-a large bath with shower and plenty of space. 
The beds were very comfortable and pillows and duvets were soft and comfortable. 
Check out the following morning was seamless. Our receptionist was friendly and helpful. 
We will definitely be staying here again. ",5,2019,02,25
211,Great Location and great staff,First time staying in the Croke Park. What a location - across the road from the stadium and a 10 minute walk into O'Connell Street . The staff were so friendly and couldn't do enough for you. We will  be back!,5,2019,02,24
211,Didn't Want To Leave!,"My boyfriend and I visited Dublin for the weekend, and this hotel really made our stay more comfortable. The hotel staff were lovely and always willing to help, especially when we needed advice on public transportation! The location is also very convenient, only a 15 minute walk or so into central -- and if you're not up for walking, there is a bus stop nearby (or the hotel can call a taxi for you!) It really felt like a luxurious stay for an unbeatable price. Definitely staying again next time we're in Dublin!",5,2019,02,22
211,Made me feel very welcome,The staff is very friendly and the rooms spacious and very clean. The staff has a very much can-we-help-you attitude. Will come again in March. The hotel offers free car park and a free shuttle bus in the morning and evening to and from Eastpoint business park.,5,2019,02,21
211,Lovely room and nice service!👍👌!,I stayed in the Croke park with my parents and my brother and the rooms were lovely and organised with a lot of drawers and there is also two phonebooks. There is a huge TV with lots of channels. If you would like a walk into the city  and look at some of the many historical monuments then it is perfect.,5,2019,02,21
211,Amazing service 😇,"I went to the Croke park hotel with my dad john, mom Fiona and brother David. The service  was absolutely amazing when I arrived I got served with hot towels and at 10 o clock in the morning my room was cleaned 🧹 and there was chocolates and biscuits waiting for us in the room and there was amazing chicken korma in the restaurant, the sideline bistro 😃.
I would say that my stay from the restaurant to the room was immaculate.
I would 100% recommend the Croke park hotel.",5,2019,02,21
211,Simply lovely,"This is the second time we have stayed at this hotel. The staff are really welcoming and nothing is to much trouble. 
The rooms are really clean and well equipped. Plenty of hot water. 
The breakfast is again fantastic and sets you up for the day. If I had to be ultra picky, the only thing I would say is the music played at breakfast is really bad but luckily not to loud, so the noise drowns it out. 
I would definitely stay a third time. 
Thank you for a lovely break. ",5,2019,02,20
211,Dublin visit,"stayed here for 3 nights, a nice hotel about 15 mins from the city centre a good walk. Had a meal here the special but the beef used was a bit grizzly. Fish and chips were nice, the vegetables served with the steak were hard and cold. Don't think we would choose to eat here again. Had breakfast on the day we left at the coffee station wasn't too bad.",4,2019,02,20
211,Great Customer Service,"I would definitely come here again. The customer service was good and the team was very accommodating. The only complaint I would have is for the Hotel to consider changing bed frames from wheels being on the bottom. The place is so grand and beautiful, wheels on the bottom of the frames takes away from that. Other than that I definitely enjoyed myself and they even accommodated me with access to the executive lounge after a mistake of their own. 

Would definitely visit again.",5,2019,02,20
211,Perfect! Well done Croke Park.,"We stayed for four nights from Friday 15 Feb and from start to finish everything was fantastic.
We chose the Croke Park over other, more central hotels because it seemed to offer us more for our money.  Having visited Dublin eight times previously we had a lot to compare it to. I can honestly say (having stayed at the Gresham and Westin too) Croke Park is our fave. It is a high end four star without the pretentiousness of some more traditional five star hotels, which we prefer.
We were checked in by the lovely Gary who was so helpful and deserves a mention. 
Our room on the Exec. floor was perfect.  Some have described the furniture as dated. It is not, the furniture is absolutely top quality and traditional. Spot on in our book. Everything was immaculate too. 
We requested room service on one occasion, for supper, and our food was spot on. Food in the Bistro was great too. We had a good bit craic with one of the young waiters (Liverpool supporter) who was so friendly along with our fab waitress (small young blonde lady) who was excellent too.
It was lovely to receive a call from the hotel manager on our second evening asking how our stay was going - a nice touch! 
Our early morning call happened as requested, check out was smooth, our taxi was there waiting for us as requested. 
10/10 Croke Park, we’ll be back.  From M Armstrong.",5,2019,02,19
211,Mid term break,"Spent the last few days with my partner in the hotel, and we had a great stay. Warm welcome and friendly staff. Got an upgrade to a lovely executive suite which was beautiful 👍
Handy 15min walk to city centre and taxis available via front desk if needed. 
Only one negative thing was the breakfast was slightly cold this morning. 
Would recommend this hotel as it was great value and the staff were first class 👍",4,2019,02,19
211,"SUPER HOTEL, EXCELLENT STAFF AND SERVICE","We decided to stay at the Coke park hotel as we were attending a concert nearby in the 3 Arena on Friday night. We ate in the Sideline bistro beforehand and I must the food was excellent.

We stayed for 2 nights and on the second night ate at a nearby Italian which I also would recommend.

The hotel is ideally suited and close to bus services which we used to travel to the city centre for a bit of shopping. 

The hotel is very clean and even smells it on walking through the entrance door

I highly recommend you try it.",5,2019,02,19
211,Excellent family stay. Will return again soon,"Another great stay at the Croke Park Hotel. Can’t reccomend the Hotel highly enough, it’s by far our favourite hotel in Dublin. We have stayed several times now with our two children and wouldn’t consider staying amywhere else.
 The staff are fantastic and so accommodating, our baby wouldn’t settle for dinner or breakfast in the restaurant and it was no problem at all to have it sent up to our room instead. We were down for a match in Croke Park which didn’t start until 5pm, this would have gave us several hours to kill before hand with two small children, a late checkout was offered free of change which made our day so much easier. 
The rooms are spotless clean, bright and spacious, as is the hotel. The atmosphere is welcoming and relaxed. The food in the restaurant is fantastic, with great selection for both breakfast and dinner. Restaurant staff are also fab and very friendly
Location wise it is a short taxi ride into the main city centre which suited us perfectly as I’d rather not be in the main hub of things. 
Definitely looking forward to our next stay",5,2019,02,14
211,Disappointed with breakfast ,"Stayed one night. Hotel location was convenient for the event I was attending. The hotel was busy with club finals on in Croke Park. 
The bedroom was spacious and the bed was very comfortable. The bathroom was spacious and well stocked. 
The breakfast was buffet style. There was a considerable queue for a table. The selection of food was good. I selected fried eggs from the buffet. They had just been delivered from the kitchen. When I sampled the eggs they were ‘stone cold’. I called one of the waitress and asked for two newly cooked fried eggs from the kitchen. They were delivered in about five minutes. To my disappointment (and surprise), the newly cooked eggs were again stone cold. I called the waitress and advised her. At that stage I gave up. 
The overall rating reflects this bad experience. Otherwise I would have rated the hotel as very good. ",3,2019,02,13
211,Friendliest staff ever,"When we arrived at the Croke Park Hotel, there was a huge crowd in the hotel lobby due to Football and Hurling matches that weekend. We were notified by email, so we knew it would be busy. Despite the crowd, the staff at the front desk helped us efficiently and with a smile. They made us feel very welcome. My wife was already a bit under the weather and her condition worsened during the next few days. The staff was so kind to allow us to checkout a couple of hours later so my wife could get the necessary hours of sleep to feel somewhat alive and would be able to get up and move. They even arranged some fruit and water for her. The staff was very, very kind and thoughtful. I really recommend to stay at the Croke Park Hotel",5,2019,02,13
211,Weekend break,Very disappointed with the hotel in general regarding bar and restaurant facilities. Staff seemed very inexpierienced. Lack of management very obvious. Bedroom was excellent. Very clean and spacious. Breakfast was very good as regards variety but plates cold.,2,2019,02,12
211,Sideline restaurant excellent for a pre match meal,"Had a great meal before club final match recently.Politely served, reasonably priced and considering the huge volume of supporters there. 8 of us were well sorted with late lunch and a few drinks before the match.Despite our reservations initially as clearly the hotel was very very busy we would def go again, even on a small match day. 👍🏐",5,2019,02,11
211,DCAM9 ,"Excellent 
This hotel never fails to impress, location, staff and food are all great.  Always providing a high standard of cleanliness and service. 
I would recommend spending a little more to have 4th floor room and access to the exec lounge.  Just home yesterday from 3 night stay on 4th floor and it was lovely. 
Renovations in bar are ongoing this month but do not seem to cause any major problems to the daily running of this lovely hotel.  Upgrading of media systems in bedrooms mean no movies to watch ( we did miss this facility).
Have been staying in this hotel for years and always look forward to our next visit. ",5,2019,02,11
211,Great Hotel - ticks all the boxes,"We have stayed here twice whilst visiting Dublin to watch 6 Nations rugby. The hotel is very comfortable, everyone is very pleasant, friendly and helpful and the breakfast is excellent. The first time we stayed ( in March 2018 ) we were given a free upgrade which was meant we had complementary breakfast in the lounge upstairs which was nice but this year we ate with everyone else downstairs. Rooms are spacious, very clean and comfortable and all staff genuinely keen to please and look after guests. Location is around €20 cab ride from the airport and €10 away from the centre of town and of course if you are interested in GAA its an ideal spot if visiting an occasion at the magnificent Croke park stadium",5,2019,02,10
211,Disappointed overall by Croke Park Hotel,"I found myself disappointed by a number of elements in respect to the Croke Park Hotel. Stayed recently with my company.  Staff are very nice, rooms are average at best with some design elements very dated. Food again was a let down, again I found it average and basic outside of breakfast, which was nice. Finally, I didn't find the location particularly safe at night I went for a walk one early evening and quickly returned. Some of the local neighbourhoods look very run down with gangs of teenagers being intimidating. Sorry I can't give a thumbs up to the Croke Park Hotel.",2,2019,02,07
211,Classy hotel,"This is a great hotel. Everything is spot on. The rooms are super comfy and spacious and the staff are great. The only negative is the price of the breakfast...over €20 for a full Irish? Bit steep. But other than this it's a fabulous hotel, with free parking too.",5,2019,02,05
211,Croke Park stay,As always the hotel was amazing -even though renovations are being carried out it did not disrupt the hotel or guests in any way —breakfast as usual was exceptional!! Staff always seem to take time to treat all guests a very special which makes us feel as though we are really important to hotel!,5,2019,02,04
211,"Smiles, a beautiful atmosphere and renowed Irish hospitality....what's not to like??","From the moment you walk through the door, you are met with smiles, a beautiful atmosphere and renowned Irish hospitality. The reception staff were great and nothing was too much trouble for them. My room was big (double and single bed), comfortable and very clean and had all the facilities you would expect and the food in the restaurant was lovely (I recommend the Seafood Chowder). Couple this with the fact that it's 20 minutes or so from the airport by car, 15 minutes walk into the City centre and also directly opposite Croke Park Stadium and it's a total win. I'll be staying here again without question and would highly recommend you do too :) xx",5,2019,02,01
211,Dublin visit.,"Really comfortable bed and excellent bathroom. I liked the look and feel of the place. Refurbishment was going on,in dining room, which is tricky as it impacts on overall experience. However, for me the bed is the most important thing and here the linen and quality of the bed was very high. Meetings in Croke Park so really easy access. Travel to and from airport was very easy and when asked for a taxi arrived very quickly when leaving.",4,2019,02,01
211,It’s all about the staff,"A modern, clean and well organised hotel. Made amazing by funny, efficient and hard working staff.

I have stayed in many hotels whilst traveling on business but haven’t yet been greeted as well as I was on arrival by Thomas Levandowski (not the footballer). Although we arrived just as the restaurant was closing he arranged a table for us and went the extra mile to make sure we had a pleasant evening.

Once we sat down for dinner Antoinette Darble really made us feel special and dinner really rocked. The rack of lamb was really memorable.

Well done guys, see you again soon",5,2019,01,29
211,Croke park,"Wonderful hotel with nice rooms and excellent service. Next to Croke Park stadium, convenient in case of cronference, but just a little bit too far for a walk to the city centre. However, this is compensated by fully equiped rooms, excellent service, friendly staff, good breakfast and dinner options, and a nice hotel bar.  Definitely recommended if you don't mind staying at the edge of city centre. ",5,2019,01,28
211,Croke Park Hotel Experience,"Stayed for 1 night.  luxurious accommodation. really warm welcome, reception staff were excellent.Offered an upgrade. (did not avail)  We booked a family room which  was superbly clean, comfortable and modern and had everything we needed, towels were plentiful and good quality.  The breakfast was fabulous, something for everyone.   small coffee area off reception, served delicious coffee, while relaxing and reading the morning paper. Hotel close to church and shops cant wait to go back.  ",5,2019,01,23
211,mr Billy,"we stayed at the Crokepark hotel for convenince to eccles street and the Mater hospital .Very easy to find hotel staff were excellent ,check in was faultless ,room was nice and airy ans spotless lovely to find shower and bath in the bathroom ,Bar food was great ,even though we were in the bar on an early bird menu the food was like been in a top resturant nothing was to much trouble for the staff aiways were polite and attentive ,i would have no problem staying here again",5,2019,01,17
211,Excellent,"Best bed in Ireland and wonderful staff. The hotel was clean, modern, sharp and the staff was on it. I would recommend this hotel. They help in all ways printing boarding passes, getting cabs, selecting events it was very nice. ",5,2019,01,14
211,Excellent place!,"The hotel offers a great service. The rooms are incredible! They are big, bedrooms very comfortables, amazing TV in the wall that makes you feel almost at a cinema, bathroom amenities good. Very clean and the staff very helpful. It is in a very calmed area, and about 20min walk to the center. Good choice!",5,2019,01,14
211,Great place,"Good location, good servcie, amazing rooms. The services was very good, and you feel that staff is trying to help you all time. You can request as many water bottle you need in recepcion. The room are very big, and a very big TV.",5,2019,01,14
211,TOP,a litte away from the city center but the hotel gives you a real warm feeling! feels like coming home after visiting dublin. excellent food  - cosy bar - nice bathroom - very good beds and very friendly staff,5,2019,01,08
211,CHOOSE HERE....YOU WILL LOVE IT,"Booked this hotel as a treat for my daughter who was returning to university in USA via Dublin. From the minute we arrived I knew I'd made the right choice. Such warm and  welcoming reception staff who even offer hot towels to refresh you while checking in. 
We had a lovely room on 3rd floor which we were more than happy with however the newly fitted tv wasn't working properly....sound but no picture.  I reported this to reception who addressed the issue immediately.
A short time later the picture again disappeared and although I wasn't even complaining Tomas couldn't apologise enough. He immediately offered to upgrade us to 4th floor which gives you access to the Executive Lounge. Wow! What an absolute treat with free continental breakfast and also coffee, juice, fruit cookies etc available all day long in such a relaxed comfortable area.
We were over the moon and special thanks again to Tomas who went above and beyond 
The corridors on the accommodation floors are wide and spacious with plush carpeting and this adds to the peaceful ambience.
Special thanks also to the delightfully chatty Krishna and the lovely Irish girl who helped me retrieve belongings I'd left in our first room.
A huge congratulations to the entire team at Croke Park....you should be very proud x
",5,2019,01,08
211,Long weekend in Dublin,"We chose the Croke Park Hotel via booking.com mainly because of its good reviews. It was located a bit on the outskirts of Dublin but you could walk to Dublin in around 20-30 min which was perfect for us. The staff was extremely friendly and made sure we got a nice welcome. The hotel was nice, rooms were big and nicely decorated and the bed was really comfy. We had breakfast at the hotel which was a big buffet with a variety of things to eat. Very nice. At departure the bill was given to us through the door early in the morning, so check-out was really fast. A nice touch was the water bottle we got at the check-out for our journey. All in all a very nice stay that we can recommend to everyone. If going back to Dublin we will definitely stay here again. ",5,2019,01,08
211,Great Hotel from which to enjoy Dublin,"We have just returned from a weekend break to Dublin with another couple. We were very impressed by the quality of staff we encountered throughout or stay.
From the moment we arrived the checkin process was efficient and friendly, our rooms were very clean, well equipped and comfortable. We had originally planned to eat in the hotel on 1 night and then go out to a restaurant on the second but the food in the bistro was so good that we ate in the hotel on both nights. The restaurant and bar staff couldn't do enough for us which made dining in on both nights very relaxing.
From arrival to departure we had a great stay and would thoroughly recommend this hotel. It has it all, Great Location, Free Car Park & excellent staff. Couldn't ask for anything more. Will certainly stay again
As we left they were just starting a refurbishment of the bistro/bar area which we look forward to staying again to experience the new facilities",5,2019,01,06
211,Croke Park Hotel,We always stay in The Croke Park Hotel. It is only a short walk to the city centre and it is righty beside Croke Park. We are usually attending a match but we find it convenient for any activity in Dublin. This weekend we were at the Bord Gais. It was approx. 5 mins in a taxi. The hotel is so clean and comfortable. The food is excellent but the best thing about the Croke Park Hotel is the staff. They are friendly and helpful and every member of staff smiles at the customers. It's a pleasure to come here. I totally recommend it 100%.,5,2018,12,30
211,Weekend away,We booked the Croke Park Hotel for a night in Dublin for a concert.  The room was gorgeous and breakfast was really nice.  The bed was one of the most comfortable I've ever slept in.  There was a Nespresso machine in the room which was great.  The TV in the room was massive!,5,2018,12,30
211,Dublin City Hotel,"Great location, fantastic staff, always go beyond. Love staying at this hotel, look forward to going back.  I use it for Business several times a year and never have any issues, looking forward to see how the new bar/restaurant will look.",5,2018,12,24
211,1 night stay,"Thank you for everything! Efficient check in/checkout, clean, comfortable and quiet room and delicious breakfast. The service was exceptional. The Croke Park Hotel looks like a brand new hotel from the inside with nice and contemporary rooms and public spaces. -Roland C.",5,2018,12,20
211,Fab hotel in Dublin City,A real treat to stay in this hotel. Comfortable and luxurious within a stones throw of city centre. I would highly recommend staying here if visiting Dublin. It's right beside Croke Park if you are visiting the stadium for a game or tour. ,5,2018,12,18
211,Great hotel,"Have stayed here about 4/5 times now and can't fault the hotel or the fantastic staff.  We travel to Dublin by car and the car park at the hotel is complimentary for guests which is a big plus for us. Upon arrival we received hot towels to freshen up.  The reception staff were excellent, friendly and efficient and recommended a couple of restaurants/bars to try.  The room was spotless - fluffy white towels and complimentary toiletries, huge flat screen TV, tea/coffee facilities, safe, mini bar, hairdryer, very comfy bed, complimentary water and biccies, plenty of storage space - everything you'd expect from a four star hotel.  It was a very quiet room looking down onto the enclosed smoking area outside the bar and we slept well.  We didn't eat breakfast or dinner in the hotel so can't comment on that but the day we arrived we were a bit hungry so had very tasty chicken sandwiches and a glass of wine each in the bar.  Was around 22-24 euro. Again the staff were friendly and efficient and there were a lot of people eating lunch which is always a good sign.  The hotel is about a 20-25 min walk to the middle of O'Connell Street (around a mile away) - this is the only thing we don't really like about the hotel, the location - it's just not in the best of areas.  If in doubt, get a taxi to/from the hotel.  It's ok through the day but probably best to get a taxi back at night.  I'm sure there's also a bus route running close to the hotel but have never looked into this.  A complimentary mini-bus to/from the hotel to O'Connell St maybe four times a day would be great!  Super gym at the hotel just off the reception area, all the equipment you need, airy and spacious with complimentary fruit, water, newspapers and towels.  The music was shocking though lol!! (Stupidly forgot my earphones!).  Complimentary bottles of water when we checked out as well.  We really enjoyed our stay here and will no doubt be back in the future.  ",5,2018,12,18
211,Jus as good as the last time.,"Just back form one night in the Croke Park hotel, this is the 4th time we have stayed here in the run up to Christmas.  Hotel very clean, staff very helpful in particular Krishna, he was on duty last year and every time he is exceptionally helpful. Breakfast plentiful and varied. Looking forward to returning again.",5,2018,12,17
211,Wonderful Stay,Had a great stay at The Croke Park Hotel - beds were super comfortable and little extras in the room like the complementary water and mini fridge was really nice as most hotels don't have these any more,5,2018,12,17
211,"Great stay, friendly staff","Felt very welcome, staf did their best to attend to my needs. Gym is very nice and breakfast is delicious! I chose the hotel mainly because it was close to my office, but it exceeded my expectations. Second time there and will certainly return.",5,2018,12,17
211,Another great stay,"Just back from another stay in the croke park. Stayed 2 years ago and had a super time so when needed a room in Dublin for the night it was the first place I looked. Stayed on 4th floor do had use of executive suite but didn't actually use it. Room was lovely and great shower and the food we had was great.
",5,2018,12,15
211,Could not fault one thing!,"I booked a couple of rooms for my company. We were staying at the hotel as our Christmas party was on in the croke park stadium. From the very start of making enquiries until the check out, the customer service was top class. Five star quality. The beds were Devine, very comfortable. The decor was lovely, the Christmas decorations were beautiful also. 

All in all, I could not think of one bad thing whilst staying there. Thank you for your outstanding service and very friendly staff. Highly recommended.",5,2018,12,15
211,Christmas,"I would like to take this opportunity to compliment the Croke Park on their wonderful Christmas decoration around the hotel they looked amazing and whoever did them has a fantastic eye for detail I particularly have to compliment the way the arches of garland and lights are done on the way down to the sideline bistro give the place a real magical feel I have to say I really enjoyed my stay here once again with excellent service and wonderful friendly and accommodating staff thank you to all.

211,Great craic at the Croke,Booked the Croke for a business meeting. The team there could not be better. Polite and friendly - nothing too much trouble. Lovely rooms and great atmosphere in the public areas - bar and restaurant particularly good. The Concierge team is amazing - cannot recommend highly enough with a special thank you to Kumar (I think - sorry didn't note your name and memory's not what it used to be!) Thanks to all though for making our stay so easy and pleasant!    ,5,2018,12,13

211,Great food and Staff,"The service is exceptional to none. The staff make this hotel. You will meet the most accommodating staff Peter, Siobhan, Nadia, January, Thompaz and Colin in the lounge Great atmosphere and service. It is well worth the visit ",5,2018,12,12
211,Nice hotel right beside the stadium,"Not cheap, but it's what a decent hotel in Dublin costs.
Friendly front desk
Nice room but with a rather odd configuration: one double bed which is fine for one person but would be a bit tight for two and one individual bed.
Good working space in the room and a HUGE television
Bed was comfortable, shower was good
Breakfast excellent",5,2018,12,12
211,Lovely Stay at the Croke Park Hotel,"We stayed at the Croke Park Hotel for 3 nights. The hotel is beautiful, great ambiance and buzz. The breakfast has a great variety and very nice as is the food in the bar. The rooms are comfortable. The staff are always helpful. I can't wait for my next stay in the Croke Park Hotel and have no problem recommending this hotel.",5,2018,12,11
211,Superb,"Lovely hotel with some truly exceptional staff. Very clean and tidy. Modern, comfortable bar/restaurant (if a tad pricey, but that’s Dublin in general). 15/20 min walk from the city and right next door to the stadium. The continental breakfast room on the 4th floor is a delight!",4,2018,12,10
211,The Croke Park,"From the moment I walked through the doors the staff was very warm and welcoming. They put forth every effort to ensure my stay was completely wonderful. The front desk staff was extremely professional and friendly and the hotel/hotel room was very clean and quiet. I would definitely recommend this hotel to other travelers and I would definitely stay there again. Thank you for everything!! 
** This hotel is slightly on the north side of town. Although it is very walkable to restaurants, pubs and stores - if you desire to be within one to two blocks of the large shopping and dining districts of Dublin, this may not be your best hotel choice. However, I have nothing bad to say about the hotel and their staff.",5,2018,12,09
211,Spotless clean and comfortable beds,"Arrived on Saturday afternoon and there was a slight mix up with the room on arrival - this was promptly dealt with by the night duty Manager who we found both pleasant and efficient - our room was spotless and very roomy - tea and coffee was in the room along with fresh towels and beautiful toiletries - probably one of the comfiest beds we have ever slept in
Dining and breakfast were in the ground floor bistro - we did get to breakfast early as we had read it gets busy so had no problem whatsoever - food was beautifully cooked and very fresh - 
We had use if the executive Lounge which was lovely after our night in Dublin - to get into town is a taxi drive away but worth it as you have the secure parking in this hotel
Check out is at 12 so plenty of time to have breakfast and no rush to check out
Would I visit again - yes def would most certainly recommend",5,2018,12,09
211,Lovely stay at the Croke Park Hotel,"I chose the Croke Park Hotel primarily based on location (am familiar with it from travelling to matches in Croke Park over the years). It was near a bus route I was using to get to a conference in north Dublin and is within 15 minutes walking distand of O' Connell St. I was able to leave my car in the car park and not go near it for 3 days. It turned out to be a very enjoyable stay. The room had everything I wanted. It was clean and had an in-room temperature control. I didn't hear a sound from any other part of the hotel in the room. The food for breakfast was delicious. Most importantly for me, the staff were a pleasure to deal with. I don't think they could be have been nicer.",5,2018,12,09
211,Short stay,"Great location. Parking available. Room clean and comfortable. Food menu limited and repeated on day two. Staff very friendly. Next to Crowe Park for tours of stadium. Breakfast extra on top of pricey room rate, booked on hotel.com.",3,2018,12,04
211,Hi,Lovely hotel in good location to the 3arena.very comfortable  bed and every  thing you come want in the room.bathroom clean and tidy and spacious .the breakfast was ok.tables slow to be cleared and had to ask same girl twice for toast. .but would stay there again.,5,2018,12,03
211,Dining Room let down a good experience ,"Simple check in by professional, friendly and helpful staff.  Room was clean and well laid out.  Very comfortable bed and spotless bathroom.  Had dinner in the dining room that night which was OK,  poor enough menu choice but polite staff.  Breakfast next morning involved queues,  insufficient staff on duty and general mayhem.  Dining room needs attention to detail to what was otherwise a good stay. Front desk staff deserve special mention for helpfulness. This ",4,2018,12,02
211,Croke Park hotel,"A lovely 4 star hotel right at croke Park stadium.The double room was large and comfortable with a 50 in tv .The bed was very comfortable and the bathroom was also luxurious.I did not eat or have breakfast soo I can’t say but judging by the rest would think it’s good .The hotel is a fair walk from city center ,about 20minutes .",4,2018,12,02
211,One of the Best tours our retirement club has ever done,"We are a group of men (seniors) from Tallaght who made a trip to  Croke Park recently for a guided tour of this fabulous stadium and we are anxious to express our satisfaction with our time spent in this world class stadium.
We done the stadium tour with an excellent guide (Cian) It took approx. 90 minutes for the tour but we wished it had been twice as long. It was enjoyable and informative for every minute of it with the highlight being the tunnel walk and audio sound. The side line view of the stands shows just what a fine set up the G.A.A. has created. 
The Museum was free and you could spend endless hours looking at Tv matches, pictures and information from the past and present.
The Blackthorn Café has a fine selection of food reasonably priced and lovely friendly staff.
We spent well over 4 hours there and enjoyed every minute of it. The setup is very professional it made me a very proud Dub G.A.A. fan and we would highly recommend this tour to everyone whether you are a native Dubliner or a visitor to our Fair City, a visit to Croke Park is a must.

211,Super comfortable beds and very friendly staff,"Myself and two friends stayed in the Croke Park Hotel for a Saturday night in Dublin and had a fantastic time. We arrived early in the morning to drop off our bags and were surprised and delighted that the room was ready. Tommy on reception was very friendly and explained that access to the Executive Lounge was also included in our package. The hotel itself was really lovely and comfortable, but the lounge was one of the nicest hotel features I've experienced. The self service buffet with pastries, meat, cheese and fruit really made the stay. We got back late that night, the room which had three beds was really comfortable with a great shower and a really nice view of Whitworth Road. Every single staff member we met from room service to breakfast the next morning went above and beyond. This was a fantastic experience all round and would definitely recommend.",5,2018,11,26
211,1 night stay,"Excellent customer service, perfect facilities including free overnight parking.  I will definitely stay again.  Location excellent for city access and facilities to leave the car while shopping was brilliant.",5,2018,11,23
211,This i a really nice hotel,"We stayed here a few times I didnt get a chance to write a review but this place goes above and beyond to make your stay worth wile, the staff are amazing food is great bar 100%, its clean warm and anything you ask for is there should be 6 star.
Only reason we move is to be in the city center",5,2018,11,23
211,My first 5 Star rating!,"Myself and my wife stayed in the Croke park Hotel on Monday 19th November for one night and to be honest I wish it had been for a week. Everything about the stay was fantastic. The staff at reception were so nice and a credit to the hotel. The concierge who was friendly and chatty and organised taxis for us to the 3 Arena. The bar staff, and the cleaning staff Everyone greeted you with a Hello and a warm smile. 
The cleaning staff don't normally get a mention on reviews I notice but they deserve a special commendation on this occasion as our room was made up beautifully and it was spotless. We stay in lots of hotels all over Ireland and out room (121) was the Cleanest and freshest we have ever staying in. 10/10 to the cleaner. 
Food was lovely, both our dinner and the breakfast the following morning, with a massive selection to choose from. Rooms were quiet and very contemporary and the carpark convenient and safe. 
It was our first time to stay in this hotel in Dublin but hopefully it will not be our last time. We will be back.
Bill and Miriam Goggins, Cavan, R.O.I.",5,2018,11,22
211,Deserves 6 stars!,"This hotel deserves 6 stars! The hotel reception and concierge were absolutely fabulous. The concierge answered all my questions and gave perfect restaurant recommendations. We were upgraded to a fourth floor room. The executive lounge has coffee, tea, and water during the day. It also had a complimentary continental breakfast in the morning. Another perk was the free parking. Finally, the beds were dreamy. After a long flight from the United States, I slept like a baby in their bed. 

The hotel is a bit of a walk from the center of the city, so we used taxis to get back and forth.

Thank you for a wonderful stay Croke Park!",5,2018,11,21
211,5 Star Service,Great stay again - they are in the middle of a refurbishment and I am looking forward to see how it looks - hopefully they will retain the friendly relaxed feeling currently in the lounge area.All the staff were friendly and attentive and once again Peter the bar manager went out of his way to make sure my stay was okay . Cant recommend this hotel highly enough - would not want to stay anywhere else in Dublin.Its that good my wife is coming over for a couple of nights in December.,5,2018,11,19
211,Fantastic Hotel,"Stayed here for 2 nights, Food was excellent and staff very helpful and friendly.. A bit pricey in the bar for drinks and one grumpy Barman  who always tries to avoid serving you .. But overall a fantastic stay here, reception staff very friendly and helpful .. A clean and well designed hotel well worth a visit with underground parking aswell ",5,2018,11,19
211,Nice Stay in Dublin,"My wife and stayed at the Croake Park hotel on our way back from Vienna to NY.  We really liked the place.  Check-in, check-out was very efficient, staff was very friendly and polite.  Rooms and overall facility is great.  Breakfast is very nice.

I would definitely recommend",5,2018,11,19
211,Highly Recommended,We book this hotel on reviews alone and we were not disappointed from the minute we arrived and greeted by a lovely friendly guy at reception until we left the experience was top class. Easy free secure car parking  and a very welcoming reception area. Rooms clean bright and cheerful. We had dinner in the bar and food and service were both excellent. Breakfast was included in the price and was absolutely delicious spoilt for choice again staff and service amazing. On checking out we were offered complimentary water for our journey home. hotel is a short taxi drive to the main shopping area which was not a big deal would we stay here again - yes without a doubt!!,5,2018,11,19
211,Beautiful hotel in Dublin,"I recently (Nov. '18) traveled with a group to Ireland and while in Dublin stayed at the Croke Park Hotel.  It is modern, beautiful and the staff is professional, helpful and friendly.  Our room was very nice with a mini fridge, plenty of closet space and a large bathroom with a separate shower and tub.  The beds and pillows were very comfortable.  We really enjoyed the food and large bar area with tv screens and one large projector style screen to watch sports.  I highly recommend staying, at least strongly consider the hotel as you will not be disappointed.  Thank you Croke Park staff!",5,2018,11,16
211,A gem in Dublin City,We stayed two nights in the hotel and from the time of our arrival until we checked out we received top class service from all staff.  Everybody was so helpful and couldn't do enough for us.  I would highly recommend The Croke Park hotel.  ,5,2018,11,14
211,Conference,"Visited this hotel a couple of times. I was attending a conference here last month. 
The staff here are very friendly. Special mention to the girl looking after the conference - I think her name was Sara. She was so friendly and bubbly.",5,2018,11,14
211,Great place to chill out,"Good location. I took Aircoach and got off in Drumcondra. Hotel is directly opposite Croke Park. Staff were wonderful and really helpful. Hotel was in good location and was very comfortable. Food was reasonably priced and good quality. Took off one star as some of the decor was looking bit tired, but would still recommend it. Bed was really comfortable with deep mattress and toiletries smelled heavenly",4,2018,11,12
211,Fantastic!,"Myself and my husband recently visited this hotel and were absolutely delighted with the wonderful customer service we received.Any member of staff that we spoke were delightful to deal with and a credit to the hotel.I'd like to mention the concierge team especially Sean the trainee, who went out of their way to obtain a taxi for us on Friday night so we'd be on time for a show in the Bord Gais. We hadn't stayed in the hotel in a couple of years but we felt that the the current quality of customer service being offered in the hotel is remarkable.I'd like to comment also that we were very impressed with the renovation work carried out in the bedrooms and corridors around the hotel.We're looking forward to visiting the hotel again soon.",5,2018,11,11
211,Outstanding stay yet again.,"From the minute you arrive to the time you check out the level of service is excellent. The staff are a real asset at this hotel, they welcome you with a smile and ensure your every need is met. The breakfast is exceptional with a wide and varied choice. It's a fantastic hotel and perfect for both the business and leisure traveller.",5,2018,11,09
211,A good spot close to the airport and the city centre,"The hotel offers everything one can expect for the price and in terms of friendliness of personnel and room equipment even exceeds expectations. It's quite close to the airport and some 3 kilometers from the city centre. My room was clean, comfortable and relatively spacious. Do recommend.",4,2018,11,07
211,An unexpected piece of excellence,"We were attending a show in the 3 arena last weekend and when looking for hotels nearby we came across The Croke Park. I had passed this hotel on a few occasions during events in croke park but never had been in it. We booked and just expected a bed, a clean room and a nice breakfast the next morning. On arrival we were blown away, the first thing I will commend is the reception we got so welcoming and warm. We wanted a taxi booked and this was seen to for us for the friendly gentleman at reception. We left our bag in our room and didn't want to leave! The bed alone could be described as a fluffy cloud, so comfortable. The room was immaculately clean. I honestly felt like we were in a 5star. On arrival back after our show we decided to grab a drink in the bar. The decor was beautiful, so modern yet so homely. The barman greeted us with a warm, inviting attitude. The next morning, we opted for a room service breakfast which was delivered precisely at our desired time. It was so tasty. On departure from the hotel we were given bottles of water which was a simple but nice touch. Cannot recommend this place enough. Will most definitely be back.",5,2018,11,05
211,FANTASTIC HOTEL,"This hotel is across the street from the stadium facilitating easy access to the conference centre at Croke Park.  The executive suite rooms are large, comfortable, well equipped and have a bathroom with a separate bath and walk in shower.

Executive suite guests have access to a private lounge which provides a free breakfast and tea, coffee and beverages along with snacks throughout the day.

The staff are friendly and helpful and it is a really great experience staying here. ",5,2018,11,05
211,marathon weekend,"Have stayed in this hotel with my family for the 2017 and 2018 marathons, amazing hotel, great staff, well looked after from check in to check out, have booked it again for the 2019 marathon. Would not stay anywhere else in Dublin.",5,2018,11,04
211,Short Stay,"Stayed in this hotel at the weekend.  Absolutely fabulous - from the friendly hotel receptionist, to the comfortable room, to the hearty breakfast.  I would not hesitate in recommending this hotel.  The small things really matter here - from “The White Company” toiletries to the complimentary bottles of water on departure - it all adds up to a lovely experience.  Will definitely be back when next in Dublin.",5,2018,11,04
211,Absolutely loved it.,Absolutely loved this hotel and Dublin! Unfortunately only had a few nights here but could have easily stayed longer. Cheerful receptionist who asked how our journey had been and was very nice. Made us feel super welcome! The room was spotless and had enough space for our bags and everything. Nice bathroom and shower worked really well. Cleaning staff were very thorough and left it looking lovely again when they came in. Location was brilliant and had an amazing time!,5,2018,11,03
211,marathon stay at the croke park hotel,"this is a first class hotel ,,the staff and the facilitys are superb. i stayed here during the marathon 2018  and i was made to feel very special ..had the use of the excetutive suite which was wonderful.. highly recomend this hotel to all .fidelma mc fadden./ dongal",5,2018,11,01
211,Croke park Hotel - a pleasant surprise,"Stayed in this hotel last Wednesday/Thursday and was very pleasantly surprised.  The staff were friendly and very efficient, the room was a good size, very clean and had everything I needed.  Will defo stay here again and have no hesitation in recommending this place.. ",5,2018,10,30
211,Croke Park Hotel,"I stayed there overnight recently, and it was a fabulous experience - I would thoroughly recommend it. Excellent location, easy parking, very friendly and helpful staff, very clean and exceptionally comfortable room, excellent breakfast.",5,2018,10,30
211,Great place to stay,"We stayed here two nights while visiting Dublin.  Everything about the hotel was outstanding.  The bar area was spacious, the restaurant is on site and the food was very good and very nicely presented.  The rooms were spacious and clean, beds and pillows were of high quality and comfortable.  We had breakfast in the mornings which was typical European buffet.  Wait staff was friendly and handled our large group with ease.  The On-Off bus picked us up right outside of the hotel and dropped us off at the end of a long day of touring in Dublin.  The bus makes 32 stops and not expensive at all.  The only downside - The hotel had a ""wake"" on our last night and the crowd was overwhelming and very, very loud and took up the whole bar area.  My suggestion would be to have put them in a separate room not a public space.  I highly recommend this hotel to everyone visiting Dublin.",5,2018,10,29
211,Made it all possible,"I project managed a big charity event which took place in Croke Park stadium last Tuesday. The event was a challenging one for all involved. An event which presented several logistical challenges. The management and staff of Croke Park Hotel were instrumental in making the event the success it was. Our participants and staff were so dependent on the efficiency, flexibility and professionalism that was shown at all times throughout every department in the hotel. No matter what the ask was, we were looked after. In the lead up to the event, Simona in the reservations department was tested on many occasions and every time she provided a solution with absolute professionalism and above all....care. She really did care for us and it showed in her work ethic. Siobhan in the front desk was outstanding also. I am sorry I do not know the names of each and everyone of the front office staff. They are all superstars! Congratulations to the management on having such a fantastic team. ",5,2018,10,29
211,Exceptionally clean and welcoming hotel ,"From the moment we walked into the hotel we were welcomed by friendly, helpful and happy staff. Concierge available 24/7, knowledgeable and helpful. 
Rooms are exceptionally clean, extremely comfortable beds and quiet rooms. ( And I am very very fussy about standard of comfort and quality of beds and cleaning)! 
Location- easy 15/20 mins walk into centre or bus ride. 
Breakfast buffet had a good selection of cooked and continental foods. Hotel is undergoing renovation which will make the breakfast areas and systems more efficient. The small complaint I had about this was dealt with by the restaurant and hotel manager with sincerity and a genuine apology. 
This hotel will be my first choice of accommodation when visiting Dublin again and I look forward to returning. ",5,2018,10,29
211,Amazing visit to croke park hotel,I highly recommend this accommodation to families. The rooms were outstanding and the cleaning was of high quality. The food was very pleasant and the staff were friendly. I rate this 10/10! I would for your family and friends to have an amazing time here,5,2018,10,28
211,Nice Hotel,Our group started an Irish tour at this hotel. The facilities are nice and rooms are well appointed. The only drawback I found is the distance from any decent variety of pubs or restaurants. The on-site restaurant is awesome and food selection was plentiful. One common thread throughout our stay was the friendliness and warmth of the staff,4,2018,10,27
211,Wonderful visit,"Just a hop, skip and jump from the main action! Easy to walk anywhere! My husband and I loved staying here. We were able to check in early and take a nap after our long flight. Thanks for your help, Ukarma!",5,2018,10,27
211,Great customer service,"We had a very early departure to the airport.  Ukarma at the front desk made sure we received our to go breakfast,coffee and newspaper.  He also verified that our transportation was scheduled and on its way.
Great customer service
Thank you",5,2018,10,27
211,WOW-WHAT A GREAT TEAM,"Visited this hotel earlier this week and honestly the customer service and friendliness of everyone was just so impressive. Every corner we turned someone was willing to offer assistance. I was there with my daughter and before I even had to ask a lovely gentlemen was ahead of us opening doors and directing us. Very friendly staff around the reception area and in the bar, once again everyone was most welcoming. One of the staff members in the bar jumped in and offered to heat the baby food in the microwave. It's all minor stuff really I guess, but it makes a real difference. Fair play to you guys!!! Thanks for making our visit such a lovely one.",5,2018,10,23
211,Business stay and meeting,"I stayed in they hotel twice, in august and October this year. The second time we had a business meeting there as well. The rooms are very good and comfortable. The food is great.  Meeting facilities are pretty good too.  The only thing which was a bit substantial was service in the restaurant - the bar service was good.  It takes ages to get coffee at breakfast time and at lunch time, no eye contact with the staff whatsoever, as they avoid looking at guests...",5,2018,10,22
211,Incredible place for a short stay,"The Croke Park Hotel is just across from the Croke Stadium. The hotel is very clean, and the staff are super friendly. We have been shown true Irish hospitality. The concierge has been extremely helpful in assisting us. He was a wealth of knowledge.",5,2018,10,16
211,Terrific short stay,"My wife and I stayed at the Croke Park on our last night of a CIE coach trip around Ireland in early October. We really enjoyed our stay and were impressed with the size of the room (three very comfortable beds), quality breakfast, polite and helpful staff, business centre (didn't charge to print boarding passes like a competitor!) and good proximity to the airport. 

It is a long way from the 'hub-bub' of the city centre but is well worth considering.",5,2018,10,16
211,Nice hotel,"Stayed one night in the hotel due to an early morning hospital appointment. It is very close to the Mater Hospital. Cannot comment on breakfast as I was fasting!!
Room was comfortable and parking was free. It is a short walk into O'Connell Street. Overall a good choice for anything in the north of the city",4,2018,10,15
211,Great hotel...even better staff!,Stayed for one night last weekend to attend the Kylie Minogue concert in 3Arena which was then postponed! The Croke Park is a wonderful hotel with the most friendly staff you could find anywhere. I have stayed here many times although less in the past year or two as prices have risen substantially as they have in all Dublin hotels. The hotel is modern and clean and there is complimentary parking which is a bonus. Breakfast is fabulous and bar food is delicious. Would recommend this as a base for visiting city centre but would advise visitors to get the bus/taxi in as the surrounding areas have become less safe for walking through especially after dark. I availed of an Autumn Special deal on this stay which made it more affordable and hope more of these deals could be introduced to allow loyal customers like myself to visit more often! ,5,2018,10,13
211,Hotel was fine; location was disappointing.,"We began a 10 day trip to Ireland at The Croke Park. 

The common areas of the hotel were very nice.  The staff was cordial and efficient. The food was good. In fact, we had the best scones of our trip at The Croke Park. 

Our room was pedestrian and disappointing. It reminded me of a Hampton Inn. Nothing wrong with it, but fell short of four star expectations. 

However, we chose the hotel because several sources - including some Trip Advisor reviews - touted the location as being convenient to the airport and we had to return to the airport for our rental car the following day. Well, we must be missing something. It is NOT an airport hotel. It may be convenient to the airport bus line, but we elected to take cabs, so there was no real advantage. I’d guess that we were maybe 5- 10 minutes closer then the hotels in the city center.  Those hotels, by the way, also offer a lot more in the way of restaurants, etc. The Croke Park didn’t seem to be close to much except the stadium.  

Bottom line?  Nice hotel and it wasn’t their fault we were steered in the wrong direction, but it was not what we were expecting.  

",4,2018,10,11
211,Gem near the stadium,"We stayed in this hotel for a night, enjoyed it very much. Concierge Stephen was so helpful, arranging transportation and a wealth of information. He was very visible and available and friendly too. The breakfast buffet was the best we had in Ireland, over a 13 day trip! Their orange juice was spectacular, couldn't find OJ anywhere else in Ireland that we liked. Though the neighborhood isn't great, there were many transportation options from the hotel and we would definitely choose this one again.",5,2018,10,11
211,"Clean, modern hotel right across from Croke Park and easy access to highway.","This is a very nice hotel. Our room was clean and updated, and our bathroom was very nice as well. The staff was very friendly and was accommodating to us during our very early check out. They even gave us 2 wake up calls to make sure we got up, which was greatly appreciated.",4,2018,10,09
211,As Always - Excellent,"The Croke Park Hotel is always a very enjoyable hotel to stay at.   The staff are wonderful, the rooms are clean, fresh, large and well appointed.  Location is great because you are a short ride to downtown and the airport.  It is also in a quiet area except for game days. Highly recommend.",5,2018,10,09
211,Nice two day visit,"No complaints about the hotel. The rooms are spacious, the bed very comfortable and the breakfast superb. The front desk and restaurant staff were very helpful and the hotel was very clean. The only downside is that Croke Park is a fifteen minute walk from central Dublin along residential streets. To our knowledge, there is no public transportation near the hotel although there is a free pick up for those using the hopon hopoff bus. That aside though we would recommend strongly the hotel and can fully understand why the hotel warrants such a high reputation.",4,2018,10,07
211,Great stay,"Easy check in and great bar, and breakfast in the morning. Delightful staff and close to downtown. the walls in the room were VERY thin but don't let that deter you. It was a lovely stay and a great hotel. ",5,2018,10,07
211,Never fails to impress ,"Visit again this year as I generally do once or twice a year. From Check-in, to the staff in the Bar & restaurant, to all the associates you meet they are helpful, pleasant and attentive.
The food is excellent. This hotel is certainly worth the extra cost compared to other hotels in the area. Close to the city & all attractions are within an easy walk. ",5,2018,10,07
211,"Clean, comfortable and nice","My wife and I stayed at The Croke Park for the first 2 days of our trip. The hotel staff was friendly and helpful even at 12:30 am when we checked in. The hotel has a great lounge area in the lobby, and a nice modern bar. Parking is conveniently located below the hotel and they take guest security very seriously. The rooms were clean and comfortable.",4,2018,10,07
211,Great hotel,"This is the second time I've stayed at the Croke Park, the last being nearly 10 years ago, and unlike a lot of hotels, this one has stayed on top of its game. Clean and roomy rooms, great breakfast, nice bar/lounge area.",5,2018,10,06
211,Great hotel ,"Thanks a lot to all the friendly staff! Best service ever. 
The rooms are modern and comfortable also clean. 
Breakfast could be a more things to choose but the coffee is great and included.  
20 min walk to town.  Free WiFi.  Very cool to have a concierge! ",5,2018,10,05
211,AN OASIS IN THE CITY,"I would normally stay with family for all of my trip home to Dublin but this time I decided to "" hang out ""  for a few days ( 3 in total in Croker)
I was stunned to see the Hotel right across from the Mecca of Croker itself ...I have been attending Croker as a player and later a spectator since the 70's.
My flight was in very early ,4am, but the Receptionist still managed to find me a room until mine was ready .
Fantastic breakfast , sumptuous comfort in the bedroom and truly brilliant attention to detail ...slippers at the ready, Butlers choccies on the pillow , and bed turned down each night .
Would also like to give a hearty shoutout to Brendan, the pm concierge "" up the Dubs""",5,2018,10,01
211,September 2018,This hotel was very nice to stay in.  The rooms were very comfortable and the bathroom was very nice.  The hotel restaurants were nice but a little over priced.  The morning breakfast was great and they offered many options.,4,2018,10,01
211,Excellent,"Enjoyable stay.  The room was very clean and comfortable.  Lovely friendly staff, who had patience and made time for children.  The food and service was fantastic also.  Id highly recommend the Croke Park Hotel.  The location was perfect and their on the door taxi service was very convenient.  We will be back to stay again.  Many thanks.  ",5,2018,10,01
211,Great Hotel,"Stayed for 2 nights, I asked for a room on the upper floors, which I got. My room was spacious, clean and well equipped. Breakfast food was brilliant on both mornings and the bar food I got was excellent, tasty. it was close to the Luas line (about 10min walk) and car parking facilities where excellent too. Will definitely return when in Dublin for further work trips. ",5,2018,09,28
211,Fab hotel,"I love this hotel... i stayed here for my xmas party, all the staff were fab. The rooms are well designed, warm, soft beds. I just cant wait to stay again...
Very clean, staff lovely, decor modern. Great location",5,2018,09,26
211,The best bet in Dublin!,"The most friendly, clean and appointed hotel we found in our 15 day trip.  The only slight low point is the distance to the city center, however, it is just a cab ride away.  The location is perfect if you want sports memorabilia. ",5,2018,09,26
211,Great hotel,"Could not fault the hotel it's a little way out of the city but there is a hop on hop off bus that passes by or taxis are very reliable.
Lovely rooms breakfast and restaurant. Staff very friendly and helpful. Fabulous place to stay ",5,2018,09,25
211,"Absolutely spot on - Fantastic bed, staff and food","First time staying here and would not hesitate recommending this hotel to others. The bed I had (room 427) was incredible, room nice ad quiet at night, nice touch with the turndown service and choc on pillow each night, G&T's in our room on arrival was a lovely touch. Everything spotlessly clean. Even the cleaners were fab and kept providing top ups on the toiletries i.e. bath gels, shampoo etc.
The bar has a really large screen to catch sport and plenty of seating so you can choose to have a quiet enough meal in there (I had soup and sandwich for 10EUR for lunch one day, and burger (15EUR(?) another evening - both were excellent). I stayed here when the GAA / Irish footy wasn't on, but imagine the vibe is completely geared up for match day. 
The staff throughout the hotel were fantastic. I can't actually remember the last time I stayed in a hotel where the attitude by absolutely everyone there from Management to front of house, to Bar / Restaurant etc was as good. It definitely created an uplifting halo-effect through to the guests too. 
Breakfast was fantastic. I don't know how they made the sausages there, but they were amazing! Couldn't find any baked beans in the buffet, but did see them on another guest's table so sure they would make them for you if you had any room left. 
In terms of the area itself - it's around 20 EUR in a taxi to the airport, you can walk to O'Connell Street in about 10mins and it cost us 15 EUR in a taxi back from Temple Bar a couple of nights. 
Overall, I'd prefer to stay here than the city centre as you definitely get more bang for your buck, it's closer to the airport and it's a nice downhill walk into the main drag (have a few Guinness and get a taxi back!). 

Thanks to all the staff!!",5,2018,09,24
211,Don't stay here,"I stay at this hotel several times a month (as I am part of an airline crew) and most all of us are not happy with this hotel.  This hotel allocates a certain number of rooms for crew stays. As one new crew arrives, they will not give us a room until the other crew members that are leaving have evacuated their rooms, and then after housekeeping has cleaned those same rooms. Rather than giving us new rooms, they recycle the same rooms over and over and over.

To try and pacify us, they try to shuttle us up to an executive lounge on the 4th floor and give us a mediocre snack so that we are out of sight and out away from the lobby.  When we mention to the hotel that by contract they are supposed to have our rooms to us within 30 minutes of arrival, several times they have said good luck finding another hotel that will allow us to check in at the hour that we arrive.

Now I just stayed here a couple of days ago and left an item in the room by accident when I checked out.  When I got to the airport, which was less than an hour away, I called the hotel to advise them that I have left something in the room and ask them if they will hold the item for me. I was assured by the front desk that they were hold the item for me until I returned in two days period

Well now that I'm back, there is no recollection of anyone having the conversation with me, there are no notes in my profile where I stayed in the previous room about me leaving an item, and hotel simply doesn't care.

I have stayed here on my own time and paid for the room out of my own pocket about four times. I will never spend my own hard-earned money at this hotel again.

There are better hotels than this, closer to the downtown and Temple Bar area. I would recommend staying at one of those before spending my money here.",2,2018,09,24
211,GAA U12 activity weekend,"Have not arrived yet but if reservation staff anything to go by, hoping for enjoyable visit to Dublin and Croke Park Hotel whilst we take part in activities at GAA HQ. Very helpful staff in dealing with our accidental cancelling of booking!",5,2018,09,23
211,One night Stay while on tour,"Stayed here the first night of a week long tour of Ireland. Hotel is fine, rooms neat and clean and the staff is super helpful. Right across from Croake Park which is a super plus if you are there for a GAA event. The one negative is that it is out of the way from other tourist type areas..Bar and restaurant were also excellent.",4,2018,09,20
211,Lovely hotel with lovely staff,"It was our third time this year staying at this hotel and each time we thoroughly enjoyed our stay. Excellent nights sleep every time. We ate in the restaurant every evening which has a great choice and the quality of the food is excellent. All of the staff we encountered during our stay were very friendly and most helpful. The hotel is spotlessly clean. The assistant General Manager Seán Reid was extremely helpful and courteous.
The underground parking facility is excellent with a lift to reception.
Overall we would highly recommend this hotel for its location sleep quality and food.",5,2018,09,18
211,"Great accommodation, bar service could be better","A frequent visitor to the hotel as it is a beautiful night's sleep, the staff are lovely and friendly and it's in a great location for me for work. However everytime I visit the bar for an evening drink it takes some time to get served. Usually one bar tender working the bar and coffee machine and not the most vigilant to notice when people approach the bar. Considering how attentive the staff at the hotel usually are the bar is a real let down.",4,2018,09,17
211,"Amazing Stay, Wonderful Staff.","Myself and my boyfriend booked in to stay during the rugby pro 14 final. From the moment we arrived we were made feel right at home we were offered so warm towels to refresh and these are just fab after some traveling. We had a lovely warm welcoming with a lovely gentleman on reception. We were very lucky to get an up grand to the ""Sam Maguire"" suite and even had some banter with the receptionist as he had previously asked us where we were from as we are from Limerick the joke was we could have a night of luxury as we would only see the real ""Sam"" as it passes to Kerry. He very kindly organised us a taxi to the Aviva. The suite was extremely spacious with an added dinning room/sitting room. 5* facilities through out the room and bathroom. The shower is amazing. Turn down service was provided in the evening. Food was remarkable both dinner and breakfast. We happily sat by the fire having a few drinks that evening. Parking was included for us and was validated on checkout. It is a clear the staff care about it's customers. We will be back.",5,2018,09,16
211,good stay,This hotel had great guest services.  the restaurant was very good!!!  The gym was quite large and had up to date equipment.  My only complaint of hotel was the location.  Not in the best area and I personally would have preferred a more central downtown.  Rooms were average...nothing great but comfortable.,4,2018,09,16
211,Honeymooner’s Delight," Overall, we loved this hotel. It was a bit hard to find at first, but I chalk this up to being an American driving in Ireland for the first time. 

We parked in the onsite car park and breathed a huge sigh of relief to be safe from the horrors of driving on the left. We found out later that though parking is €30 per day, hotel guests get free parking. 

The staff at the front counter were very hospitable and friendly and made us feel very welcome. 

The lobby is modern and nice. 

Our room was in slight need of update but overall no complaints about the cleanliness or atmosphere of the room. 

Bed was quite comfy. Large bathroom with a standing shower and separate tub. 

We were sent two bottles of champagne to our room (I do not believe this is customary for every guest, probably just because we mentioned it was our honeymoon. Classy gesture nonetheless.). 

Breakfast was outstanding. 

There is a nice bar area as well where we unwound both nights after long days in the city. 

The housekeeping staff is wonderful. We asked that our room be serviced for new towels. When we returned, everything was nicely organized. Our toiletries were tidied up in the bathroom and the mess we had left on the desk was straightened up too. 

No complaints whatsoever. Great staff, great rooms. Will likely return. ",5,2018,09,16
211,Pope,I stayed in the Croke Park hotel when the Pope visited  Ireland and as busy as it was the staff and service were excellent.  The room was bigger than the normal hotel room. Very spacious bathroom and spotless as if no one ever used it.   Shower was easy to use and hairdryer was powerful. ,5,2018,09,13
211,The best breakfast of my life,"My boyfriend and I were in Dublin for an event and went to the hotel for breakfast. What a pleasing surprise - it was absolutely amazing. I have a food restriction so the waitress introduced us to her leader, Emiliano, who promptly offered many options that suited my diet. They were both extremely kind and we are definitely coming back to stay in our next trip to Ireland! Thanks a million to all Croke Park staff!!",5,2018,09,11
211,Disappointed considering reviews read,"If you are given room 171, reject it. Low frequency noise of vent from bistro below can be heard, throughout the night. Not sure if any room is well noise insulated as could here every time next room opened and closed room door.Bathroom nice, choice of bath and shower. Bed in double room smaller than standard. and for me the pillows were not comfortable- the type you sink right into.",2,2018,09,07
211,Traveling with kids,"We spent one night at The Croke Park before flying back to the US after two weeks of travel with a one-year-old and a three-year-old.  Our kids were a disaster by the time we finally arrived at the hotel around 9pm.  Every member of the staff helped us, and our kids loved the room and had a restful night. Great dining-in options, promptly delivered.  Easy, twenty-minute drive to the airport.  ",5,2018,09,06
211,Excellent ,Had a lovely weekend. Natalie checked us in and it was the best welcome I have ever received at checkin. Everyone is so lovely and I was very impressed on the second morning that the lady remembered how I liked my coffee. Definitely be back! ,5,2018,09,05
211,Great location and comfortable start to our holiday,"Hotel was comfortable, staff were friendly and the location is very good. Bar service top notch and the Breakfast was a great way to start the day. so close to Croke park you can smell the grass. Was a bit expensive as the Pope visit was two days later, would definitely recommend staying though",4,2018,09,03
211,The Croke Park Hotel,Extremely Accommodating and Professional Hotel. The allowed Us an early check in after a 9 hour flight across the Atlantic. The rooms were spacious and clean. The staff was polite and helpful. During a problem with one room the Night Manager was quick to switch out rooms for Us quickly. ,5,2018,09,03
211,"quiet, relaxing experience",spacious and quiet.  felt like a north american hotel. excellent service.  exceeded our expectations. friendly helpful staff.  easy to walk to the downtown area. continental breakfast appreciated.  nice welcome drink at bar.,5,2018,09,03
211,Exceeded my expectations!,"Booked at the Croke Park after failing to secure reservations at the Renaissance, Westin, etc etc.   Being unfamiliar with Dublin added another level of complexity.  However, I read in another review that flight attendants stayed at the Croke Park, so I took a chance.   (I didn't realize at the time I booked that it was the same weekend as the GAA semifinals)

Service is outstanding.  I was very impressed with the management at Croke Park.

I received at least 2 emails from the Croke Park team  several days prior to arrival with useful information.  I was also advised at that time that there would be a GAA event, but the communication clearly spelled out what to expect.  A letter from the management was also waiting for me upon check-in; advising what to expect during this event.  (Who knew that the hotel is directly across from Croke Park Stadium?)

My interactions with the front desk were positive and productive.  I interacted with at least 4 different individuals, all of whom were obviously given the power to make customer-friendly decisions on the spot.   I couldn't have asked for better service, particularly because I ended up having to stay an extra night due to a flight change.  When I noticed that my invoice at check-out had mysterious charges and brought it to their attention they didn't make me feel like I was trying to rip them off.  They investigated it and found that someone had mistakenly charged my room for a party of 8's drink tab.  

My room overlooked the courtyard; bathroom was large, modern and clean, with step-in tub (and the half-glass ""door"" that Europeans love).  Toiletries are provided.  

The room decor is neutral with splashes of color (e.g. red throw); TV and an early-2000's-era CD player come with the room.  There is also a large desk that works for business travelers (fortunately I was on vacation!).  Bed is comfortable and there are plenty of pillows.  Room temperature can be controlled in room, although with temps in the 60's I kept the thermostat off.   The ""closet"" has plenty of hangers, and there is also a large in-room safe.

Location - it is north of the major Dublin attractions; I estimate a 15-minute walk to the GPO.  (or you can take the 7 bus, which is about a 10 minute walk from the hotel) It is about a 30 minute walk to Grafton Street - not bad at all.  It cost about 10 euros to cab back from Grafton Street.   I wouldn't recommend walking around by yourself at night as there don't seem to be many people out at night....other than the hotel, the only other businesses in the immediate vicinity are an Enterprise Rent A Car, an Italian restaurant that closes early, an auto repair shop, and Croke Park Stadium.  

Overall, I was very happy with the Croke Park Hotel, especially the service, and would recommend it to anyone who wants to visit Dublin, but not stay right in the middle of tourist mayhem.   (And take a tour of the stadium!)",5,2018,09,02
211,all ireland gaelic DAY,"today we spent the entirety of the day in the presence of two great guys .. daniel lambert, jamie connolly... two guys with a huge attention to detail. we hadnt got to wait more then a few seconda before our orders were taken despite the crowd up there. great job guys your work didnt go unnoticed. see you two again!!",5,2018,09,02
211,Wonderful Choice,"I highly raccomend this hotel for your staying in Dublin both for work and vacation reasons.Staff availability, hotel location (just 20 minuted by walk from the city center and from East Point business area) and sleep quality are the main key drivers for which I would suggest this hotel.",5,2018,09,02
211,"Outstanding staff, great food and prime location",Even though the hotel was full to capacity the staff were always friendly and were not rushing about in a panic. Check in was easy and the food in the bar and restaurant was outstanding. I have stayed in the hotel before and I have always found the atmosphere to be more like a family run hotel which is a real plus factor.,5,2018,08,29
211,Top Class Hotel,"This was our second stay at this hotel. We had booked a family room as we were travelling with 3 kids. This is an excellent hotel, the rooms are spacious and beds are quite comfortable as well. 

We used the restaurant for dinner and the food was once again, excellent. Lot of options for the breakfast as well and the service was faultless.

The city centre is 15 mins walk away or a short ride with taxi. Would definitely recommend it.",5,2018,08,29
211,Terrific hotel,"I have to admit that the Croke Park hotel can easily be in the same catagory as The Hilton Garden Inn hotel regarding staff friendliness, professionalism, assistance etc.

The only downside of course are the immediate other emmenities i.e., surrounding restaurants or activities. To enjoy other sites etc., one has to either walk into the town centre (circa 15 minutes) or catch a cab, or another means of transport is the Dublin bicycles. 

Other than that. I would strongly recommend this hotel if you are looking for the same level as The Hilton, but want to have a cheaper option.",5,2018,08,27
211,Nice hotel with excellent staff,This hotel is in an ideal location sitting right beside croke park with easy access to city centre either which I walked myself but public transport is available close by.The staff were all super friendly from the moment we arrived and the room was clean with a large bathroom and comfortable bed.,5,2018,08,27
211,Happy days,An excellent hotel in the great tradition of the Doyle family. Extremely comfortable beds and soft pillows large bedrooms and walk in shower as well as a bath in a large bathroom.  Food was excellent both the choices at breakfast and lunch and dinner also in the Sideline Bistro. We were a party of 6 which included children of 10 6 and 2 years old and all enjoyed their food.  Staff were very friendly and I was particularly impressed with the welcome pack for children which included a book and a variety coloring/game with pencils. Most enjoyable stay and I would thoroughly recommend this lovely hotel. Quite near Dublin city so an easy walk to centre,5,2018,08,26
211,Amazing,"Amazing hotel! a bit far from the main pubs etc but only a 10/15 minute walk. Staff were brilliant couldn't do enough for you! I would definitely recommend this hotel. The hotel was clean all the time, food was great!",5,2018,08,24
211,Overnight Stay All Ireland Hurling Final,"Booked online and got a good rate considering it was All Ireland Hurling night. 
Was given an Executive Room which was fabulous. 
The hotel was very busy all day, but well managed by the staff and management. 
Parking Excellent. Breakfast was busy next morning but again well managed and very nice. 

Great location for anyone attending match or function in Croke Park Stadium. ",5,2018,08,22
211,Restaurant...,"I travelled over to Drumcondra on Sunday for the big match.  Had difficulty in getting a ticket but eventually got lucky.  I was so excited and looking forward to supporting the Tribesmen- me being originally from Galway.  However as we felt alittle hunger coming on, myself and my husband decided to have lunch at the Croke Park Hotel.  Food / service and general atmosphere was great ...as I would expect from a Doyle Hotel.  However one waitress stands out over all the others...her name is Ellen...she was so good I asked her for her Surname...it begins with a C.... Ellen is such an asset to your Hotel...she was engaging/friendly and so efficient..so I would like to say Thank You to Ellen for adding to the enjoyment of our meal.",5,2018,08,21
211,The Croke Park hotel is excellent,"This hotel was wonderful.  We booked from a website so didn’t know the area or whether the pictures were true of the hotel.  We were very pleasantly surprised.  Hotel itself was great, reception staff outstanding.  We had a trainee and he was excellent and informative.  Rooms were very good (see picture), bathroom very good, we walked along the canal to a recommended local pub for a couple of beers.  We ate in the hotel restaurant.  Before dinner we sat in the large bar area, had a drink and and played cards.  The staff brought out peanuts and chips 3 times for us at no charge.  Then the dinner was superb!  Not only was the food excellent (Adam the Chef is talented), our server (Loredana, also a trainee) was very good.  But the Food and Bev Team Leader, Emiliano was so professional and just fantastic.  He is from Argentina and he was fantastic at his job.  This was our last night in Ireland (6 day trip) and we were thrilled to have it be our best hotel and dinner experience of our trip.  ",5,2018,08,21
211,Highly recommend this hotel,"My husband and I stayed at this hotel for a weekend and it was exceptional. The room was lovely, the staff were very helpful and the food in the restaurant was amazing. We will definitely be going back and would highly recommend it to others. Oh the breakfast was delicious too. ",5,2018,08,20
211,Very good ,"Was a lovely room, very friendly staff, food was lovely. There was a couple of minor issues with the room which I emailed the hotel about, never got a response. Lovely bath and shower in the room. Would def stay again. ",4,2018,08,19
211,EXQUISITE HOTEL,"We have just returned a couple of weeks ago from the Croke Park Hotel after spending the most wonderful weekend there to celebrate our Ruby Wedding Anniversary. No other hotel in Ireland, or indeed abroad, can come even close to its hospitality, friendly staff and courteousness as well as its incredibly luxurious stunning ambience.  We had a very speedy check-in with Abbas, who cordially greeted us with his warm welcoming smile and the refreshing hot towels. His friendly banter is something we truly enjoy.  On arriving at the bedroom we are never disappointed as they are so tastefully decorated to include safe and mini-bar as well as bathrobe and slippers. A large luxurious bathroom, to include bath and separate shower, comes with complimentary toiletries.  New luxurious feathered duvets, coupled with soft pillows are a real treat for a brilliant night's sleep.  

Mr Sean Reid, Deputy General Manager ensures he is always on hand to meet and greet all his guests with such warm hospitality. Even though he is kept busy throughout the day in every part of the hotel, he always finds the time to stop and have a friendly chat, especially on match-days and you can be assured he will courteously greet everyone with their first name.  With Sean - a true ambassador for the Croke Park hotel,  we continually find ourselves so warmly welcomed in opulent surroundings with impeccable intuitive service. As we were celebrating our Ruby Wedding Anniversary, Sean ensured that a lovely greeting card was delivered to our room as well as Moet on ice.  How very thoughtful of him!  This kind gesture certainly made our weekend even more special.

Mr Peter O'Curry, another member of management, met us several times during our stay and continually enquired if everything was as we expected.  Like all other Staff members, he unfailingly delivers quality customer service that exceeds all guests' expectations.

Breakfast was a very relaxing affair in the Sideline Bistro,  The food is always of the highest standard with an extensive buffet menu.  A wide selection of fruit juices, fresh fruit, cereals, home-baked bread, croissants and a variety of pastries is on offer as well as the hot breakfast items.  Pancakes are made on request and are served with syrup and honey.  Tea/Coffee is brought out by staff on request as well as fresh toast as often as one wishes.  The dinner menu in the evening provides a wide choice of starter, mains and desserts.  Each Staff member ensures that dinner is a culinary delight and on entering the restaurant we are always warmly welcomed by Pascale, who goes above and beyond to greet everyone in her gentle manner with such courteousness.

On check-in, Abbas ensured that our key-card provided access to the 4th Floor where the Executive Lounge provides guests with comfortable armchairs and a large screen television.  Here complimentary tea/coffee, soft drinks and fresh fruit can be savoured while relaxing and reading the complementary daily newspapers.  These items are continually replenished to ensure that guests on this floor enjoy the benefits of the 'Executive Rooms'.

Our stay in the Croke Park hotel would not be complete without a warm friendly greeting from Siobhan - another highly competent member of the Management team.  She always makes us feel at home - part of the Croke Park family -  and makes our stay truly special with her professional manner.  She was on leave during the first part of our stay, but when she came on duty on the day we were leaving, she ensured that she met up with us for a wee catch-up and some football banter.

Superpower free wifi as well as complementary car-parking - which is certainly rare in Dublin - adds to the overall welcoming and hospitable experience of the Croke Park hotel, where the entire ambience lends itself to a truly relaxing break.

The Croke Park hotel is certainly an 'Exquisite Hotel' with hospitality at its best.",5,2018,08,19
211,Hotel stay,Great place and so central location. Super atmosphere after big Gaa match's. Spent the day with the family and went to the zoo. Was able to get the Luas to heuston station and walk up to the park and return all within walking distance.,5,2018,08,18
211,Gorgeous and comfortable,"We spent one night at the end of a two week tour in England and France. It was so lovely to find a sparklingly clean and perfect bathroom! The beds were great and the staff was the friendliest I have met in 37 years of traveling with my family. Thank you for a great finale to our vacation.
",5,2018,08,18
211,GPS not accurate- look for the stadium ,"We were in Ireland for 10 days and stayed at a different hotel almost every night so got to see quite a few. This was the most modern/American style hotel we stayed at. There were many little things that made a difference- like lotion in the bathroom. All our other hotels only had shampoo and soap. The staff was friendly and they gave us each a bottle of water when we left in the morning. That was a really nice little touch. Clean room- but watch the beds! They’re on wheels that don’t lock and surprised us when we leaned on them and it moved quite a bit. Nice clean bathroom with separate tub & good size shower. Taxi to Molly Maine statue for 4 ran about $15 euro. 
If you’re looking for Irish charm, this isn’t it but it is a nice clean modern hotel. ",5,2018,08,17
211,Excellent hotel and location,"A brief 1 night stay for a society bbq, really nice rooms with plenty of space and well furnished. Check in was smooth and friendly as was checkout. BBQ food was great in a covered area, lovely food selection and good service. All staff were friendly especially bar staff & concierge. Will return ",5,2018,08,15
211,Another good experience,We have stayed here now many times over a number of years. The level of service we receive always is of a very high standard. we are due to return on a further two weekends soon. Going away on such stays are now stress free. It feels like home from home.,5,2018,08,15
211,Excellent service!,"an excellent hotel with the best level of service I have seen in my last 20 years of traveling ;)

You really feel home as people working here are exceptionally welcoming and ensure your engagement in terms of check in etc. are kept at minimum and proactively looking after you.

Breakfast same as the main Hilton hotels and location good if you don’t mind walking 15 mins to the city center. Loosing some calories on your way to dinner won’t hurt! ;)",5,2018,08,14
211,Amazing see,Couldn’t be more please with this hotel. This was our first trip to Ireland and we took the red eye in and our plane arrived early. When we arrived at our hotel it was way to early to check in however the staff was very understanding and gave us our rooms early (we were part of a big tour group not sure if that’s why but I am not complaining) . The restaurant on site was very good also and overall the staff is very friendly. Hotel is clean and modern.,5,2018,08,13
211,5 stars,"Stayed the weekend of 11th August. Fantastic service as always. THere was a match on but we were on the list to get down to the hotel. Check in was seamless and you wouldn't know there was thousands of people about for the match. 

We had dinner inteh restaurant that night, Pascale the Manager was the ultimate professional in looking after my wife and I as well as our 2 young children. Great to see the head chef John on the pass and ensuring that everything was to the high standards that are associated with the hotel. 

Bedroom was spotless and beds were so so comfortable.

I love the breakfast here and it did not disappoint, great selection and everything was cooked to perfection by Cormac even thought there must have been 100's to serve. We met Alan the Manager and Sean the assistant manager, meeting and greeting everyine and providing a real personal touch to the fantastic service. Steven the concierge kindly gave us an umbrella in case we needed it for the match, thankfully we didn't.

A stroll across the road to get into the stadium this hotel is perfectly located for game day.

The location is great, the hotel spotless and the service is outstanding but it is the people who set this hotel apart from so many others, they are true professionals but so personable also.

I look forward to our next stay",5,2018,08,13
211,Hotel ,"Excellent service, exceptionally clean, fantastic food. Very close to the city centre and the airport. Quiet area with local shops and a stone throw to nearby restaurants that serve real and fresh food.",5,2018,08,12
211,Nice place! Packed on match day!!,"Visited during the hurling semi finals! It was the place to be!  Never have seen so many people in one hotel!  I would like to make a suggestion... If a couple of the portable bars that were set up could only accept cash and offer Guinness, Carlsberg and Bulmers...things would have gone much smoother and quicker.  There was a lot of waiting and frustration.  On a positive note, their seafood chowder is outstanding!  And, there clean up crew was amazing!  You would have never known that thousands of people had been in the hotel over the weekend! ",4,2018,08,08
211,"Good choice, even if its not in the heart of downtown Dublin","Stayed here for three nights as most of the downtown hotels seemed absurdly expensive and glad we did. The Croke park is right next to the stadium and is about a half-hour walk to Temple Bar, or about an 8 euro taxi ride. No games at the stadium while we were there so no idea what that does to the neighborhood. The United airlines flight crews stay here if you can consider that an endorsement.

From the airport you can take the bus to/from the Drumcondra stop on Dorset where its only a five minute walk to the hotel. Parking at the hotel is also free.

Really ended up liking this hotel. Staff were very helpful, and the room was just right. 

Breakfast buffet was great and there were omelets and other items from the kitchen you could order for no extra charge. Lots of restaurants just over on Dorset street as well.",5,2018,08,07
211,5 Star Hotel at a reasonable price!,"Although, this hotel is not in the heart of the city center, what was nice about it was it was in the quiet section of the city. Croke Park Stadium is across the street. The city center was a nice 10 minutes or so walk. The staff was very nice. The beds were super comfortable with soft fluffy pillows and comforter. The plus was this hotel had 2 doubles in the room unlike some other hotels with a twin and double. Bathrooms were clean, I’m a stickler for a clean bath. Separate shower and run was a nice feature. There was a safe in the room for valuables. The breakfast in the mornings were very good as well! Filled you up for a day of shopping or sightseeing! 
Would recommend this hotel!! ",5,2018,08,07
211,Excellent experience,"I had not stayed here for one year before returning in October. It is nice to be remembered with a smile. All facilities were excellent as always. Free parking, friendly reception amd room very bright  and  comfortable. Overall a friendly and excellent experience.",5,2018,08,07
211,"Great location, great people","The staff at the hotel got us ready to start our first day in Dublin soon after arrival. The desk staff, concierge, and others were really wanting to help us.  Great advice like get a ticket for the Green Hop On-Hop Off), go to Fagan's for dinner, walkable spots, etc. And the bed was incredibly comfortable and room was really nice. Breakfast was also excelelnt.",5,2018,08,06
211,"Excellent Hotel, great for families","Exceeded our expectations, highly recommended. Staff very attentive and always willing to assist. Breakfast was very good and a great start to the day. Also try Wallis-Asti the Italian joint down the road for great Italian fare at reasonable prices.",5,2018,08,06
211,Brilliant Hotel,"Great room, fantastic staff and very well priced.  Ideal for family break.  Room was very spacious and clean.  The staff were so friendly, particularly Hannah the receptionist.  She was very polite and went out of her way to help.  The facilities at the hotel were brilliant and we would stay here any time we come to Dublin.  In fact we have booked to go back on Thursday again.  We loved it so much.  The complimentary car park is also an added bonus.  You can decide if you want to take the car or not.",5,2018,08,06
211,Top class,"Excellent hotel. Stayed with my wife and daughter. Executive lounge is beautiful and relaxing. Breakfast was fresh and efficient service. Rooms are clean and spacious. Cannot fault this hotel. Will definitely be back.
Thank you to the staff who made our stay extra special.

211,Quick trip to dublin,We stayed one night at the hotel. The staff were lovely and very friendly. The facilities are excellent and the beds very comfortable. The bathroom was huge with separate bath and walk in shower. Plenty of parking spaces. We didn’t have dinner in hotel but had the breakfast and that was lovely plenty of choice. Well worth a visit. We had 3 adults in a room with two double beds and there was plenty of room.  ,5,2018,08,05
211,Loved the Croke Park!,"We loved staying here because of the wonderful service, convenient location, comfortable & upscale rooms, beautiful bathrooms, etc.. The staff are very welcoming and helpful. Meals are great. Lots of nice amenities. Solid hotel. Highly Recommend👍",5,2018,08,01
211,Nice comfy hotel,"Beds were very comfortable. Dinner and breakfast were both good (we ordered French toast and pancakes that weren't on the buffet). Friendly helpful staff. A bit of a walk to downtown, but we enjoyed the walking and getting to see the city.",5,2018,08,01
211,Saturday night stay,"We stayed in the Croke Park hotel last Saturday and in spite of it being so busy due to hurling semi finals everything was great from start to finish. 
One staff member in particular, Siobhan, went out of her way to help us on check in, check out, and at breakfast. 
We were given access to the Executive Lounge to have a quieter area and the next morning the dining area was reserved for residents only. 
The room was bright and airy with a beautiful pristine bathroom. 
Everything was so good that I booked our next stay as I was checking out.",5,2018,07,30
211,one nighter,"Stayed in the hotel because we were going to both the games in Croke on the Saturday and Sunday. It worked out brilliant. Right across from the ground. Hotel clean, staff were great, food in restaurant was amazing and the place was buzzing on the Saturday evening with a live band in the bar",5,2018,07,30
211,Just perfect,"Everything about the hotel is great. The staff is very friendly, polite and helpful. The breakfast is so tasty and the quality of the products is very high. I enjoyed staying at the Croke Park Hotel and I will definitely come back.",5,2018,07,28
211,Stay here,"An excellent hotel with very friendly staff, a pleasant bar and a good restaurant.  It's all within easy walking distance to the center of Dublin.  Overall it was a very enjoyable experience.  Highly recommended.",5,2018,07,27
211,Good service ,We stayed 3 nights in this hotel. As a GHA discovery platinum member we didn’t get an room-upgrade with the remark that all rooms are occupied. The furniture and the carpets are quite worn out. Nevertheless the service is good and the employees are very helpful. They way into the city of Dublin is quite far for walking. ,4,2018,07,27
211,Breakfast was amazing!,"Came in for a lovely breakfast one morning and were pleasantly greeted at the till by Shannon and Emiliano who directed us to our table by the window. A fabulous buffet was available and the food was all really great!
Carol promptly came to take our order of an omelette and pancakes which came out nice and quickly and were absolutely delicious.
We finished off with a coffee and a hot chocolate out in the bar which Dale made to perfection! Overall, we had a really nice morning and will definitely be back for more.",5,2018,07,26
211,"Excellent, simply Excellent. ","We really enjoyed our stay in this fantastic hotel, the parking is quite convenient and it's literally across the road from Croke Park which we visited. Its not exactly city centre but a short 10/15 minute walk, admiring the stunning Georgian architecture in nearby Mountjoy Square along the way, and you're in the centre of everything. I thought the food was absolutely delicious, both breakfast and bar food in the evening. The staff were great, the bar staff were mostly young, enthusiastic and very friendly in the evening and the reception staff gave us warm towels on arrival and water bottles on leaving a nice touch. Rooms very comfortable but be aware of the safety catch on the shower otherwise you might be having a cold one. ",5,2018,07,26
211,Suitable modern hotel in expensive Dublin; Location is not ideal,"It was hard to find a hotel in Dublin that was not ridiculously expensive but still modern with larger beds (our preference). I opted for the Croke because I figured being closer to the airport would make more sense when we flew out, but to be honest, the location is not really ideal - we ended up spending so much on taxis back and forth between the hotel and central Dublin that we probably could have stayed somewhere closer to the action. The room itself was comfortable and large enough - neither on the newly renovated side or very old either - the accommodation was comparable to maybe a Sheraton or Hilton chain type hotel. It is a large hotel so we ended up with a pretty long walk to reach our room. 

They have an executive lounge - layout was nice but the only thing you get there is coffee and a couple of beverages. We were even offered complimentary drinks at the bar, except the bar staff just forgot about me so I never did get my drink. The front desk staff, on the other hand, was both nice and efficient. I think for me, some of the little effects were odd for a nicer hotel, like not having a hair dryer in the room and having poor coffee or packets of sauces at breakfast.",3,2018,07,25
211,Excellent luxury hotel a bit out of town,Fabulous hotel. Luxurious and friendly staff. Breakfast was very very good indeed. Not the cheapest but very good value for money and worth the 15/20 minute walk into the centre of Dublin. Would recommend it highly.,5,2018,07,24
211,Amazing ,"Stayed here last night with my daughter. Staff were all lovely, Tomaz at the front desk check us in, he was lovely & friendly. We later had dinner in the bar it was absolutely amazing. Our server was Dylan and he was just so kind & professional and really looked after us. We’ll definitely be back again. ",5,2018,07,23
211,A long weekend in Dublin,Lovely hotel. Very quiet surroundings considering it is quite close to the city. It would probably a lot noisier if there was a game on in the stadium. Staff could not have been more helpful and friendly. I would definitely stay here again. ,5,2018,07,22
211,Good hotel,"It's a good place to stay if you go to Dublin. It's not near the downtown, but it's 30' walking. It's located in front of Croke Park, which is a GAA stadium, so some days (match days) the bar and the restaurant are crowded, but it's not a problem at all. Rooms are new, big and modern as all the facilities in the hotel. Breakfast is OK and the restaurant food is quite good. The staff is lovely and helpful. 
In short, I highly recommend this cosy hotel.",4,2018,07,21
211,Easter break at Dublin,"Our family of 2 adults + 1 teen stayed for 5 nights in a deluxe room with two queen beds. The room accommodated as well even though the queen size bed was a bit narrow for two adults.  The access to the executive lounge in the same floor was a definite plus with the coffee/tee serving and water bottle supply. We did pay for the Irish breakfast that was nice, but could have survived with the breakfast served in the exec lounge (at no extra cost). The hotel is right next to the Croke Park stadium that is a must place to visit while in Dublin. When the gaelic games are on there are some access restrictions around the hotel - but it was also fun to feel the atmosphere anyhow. There is a car rental right next to the hotel so very convenient homebase for some driving around the Dublin vicinities. Would definitely recommend Glendalough for a full day trip.",4,2018,07,21
211,Lovely!,My travel agent suggested this hotel for a couple of nights prior to my tour. What a lovely and beautiful hotel and the staff ready to help.  Comfortable bed.  Reasonable priced. Friendly and welcoming front desk staff.,5,2018,07,20
211,Very comfortable and relaxing stay,"This hotel was lovely to stay in.  The rooms very nice and spacious and the bed comfortable.  The receptionist was friendly and welcoming on arrival and made good suggestions on what we could do the following day.  On departure, we were offered a complimentary bottle of water which was a lovely gesture. It's the small things that count and this hotel does that.",5,2018,07,19
211,Beautiful,"Amazing hotel with very friendly and s
Attentive staff 
Directly facing Croke Park stadium 
Would be amazing for concerts or gigs 
10 mins walk into Dublin City centre 
Would definitely stay again 😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀🤣🤣
 ",5,2018,07,18
211,Great Hotel,"We loved this hotel in Dublin and would certainly stay again. We arrived early in the morning from the U.S. and didnt expect our room to be ready. Upon check-in, a room wasn't available, but we were directed by the friendly staff to the breakfast area. By the end of our meal, the fellow at the front desk who checked us in found me and handed me a key. This was VERY much appreciated. The hotel overall was great, clean, modern, etc. The location is not the closest to the city center, but other than that we would definitely recommend and plan to stay again. ",5,2018,07,18
211,5 star service for 3 star price,"I stayed here on the 12th of July while attending a concert in Marlay Park. After parking my car in the free car park I took the lift to the hotel where I was immediately greeted by a concierge offering to take my bags. I made my way to reception where I received a warm welcome from a young trainee, Tommy if I remember. He couldn’t have been more polite or helpful & will prove an asset to their exceptional team (they must hand pick the staff because every one has the same fantastic attitude). I was delighted when he told me we were being upgraded to an executive room on the 4th floor with access to the executive lounge ( a lovely chill out area with complimentary tea, coffee water, soft drinks, fruit, newspapers all day & continental breakfast in the morning). The room was excellent with a super-king bed, flat screen tv, coffee machine, robes & slippers. I commented to my wife that the bathroom looked like it was fitted the day before it was so clean. We had a few drinks & ate in the bar & the five star service continued throughout. When we returned that evening our beds were turned down & a small chocolate placed on each pillow, a lovely touch & something I haven’t witnessed in years. I have been guilty in the past of choosing a hotel for proximity to whatever event I’m attending but I will stay in this hotel anytime I am in Dublin in the future, whether it’s close to what I’m attending or not. I think cleanliness & service like that far outweigh a 10 or 15 min walk to the city centre. I would 100% recommend this hotel to anyone.",5,2018,07,17
211,Very good alternative to downtown hotels,"Normally we prefer to stay in more central locations, but given the exorbitant prices of more central hotels and the fact we were driving and this hotel offered free parking, we booked here. When we booked we weren't aware there was going to be a massive Michael Bublé concert in the stadium across the street, but the hotel sent us several e-mails to let us know, including the fact that the street would be closed off by a certain time. This was very much appreciated, because otherwise we would definitely have arrived too late to be able to park at the hotel.
The welcome was very friendly and professional. The room was very spacious and the bathroom was also big, with a separate bath and shower. The bed was fantastic, very comfortable.
Because of the concert, we paid much more for the first night. I understand why this happens and I don't blame the hotel for doing this, but it did push the rate into overpriced territory for what you get.
In the end the location was pretty good, just an easy 15-minute walk to the centre.
Staff were all very polite and friendly.",4,2018,07,17
211,Croke Park Hotel,"The hotel is very convenient to Croke Park stadium. It is a very comfortable hotel, has  very convenient parking, pleasant staff and good food. Pity about the plastic glasses on match days but I guess this can't be helped on days like this.",4,2018,07,17
211,Great Hotel with Lots of Nice Touches,"Stayed here for a family birthday. Wanted a hotel in Dublin, with parking, that was nice and within walking distance from city centre. This ticked all boxes and more. Great customer service and generally just nice touches that we weren’t expecting. Hot towel at check-in to freshen up, gluten free breakfast for one of the party, water on check out and a special treat for my Mum (it was her birthday) thank you! Will def be back and highly recommend. ",5,2018,07,15
211,All Star Hotel,"Recently stayed in Croke Park Hotel and would compliment staff and management on their professionalism, attention to detail and friendliness. Had a great stay and the staff couldn't have been more helpful especially when one of our party took ill. The BBQ was a wonderful idea on a hot sunny day and the food was delicious. ",5,2018,07,15
211,Solid Hotel not without issues,"This hotel saved our lives... we escaped a horrible hotel in central Dublin and were very appreciative of this place.  Yet, there were issues with the room.  The AC could NOT keep up given the high temperatures outside, and the WiFi just didn't cut it.  Still, the excellent parking garage, great restaurant and comfortable beds are much appreciated.",4,2018,07,13
211,A great place to stay!,"My husband and I arrived in Dublin, Ireland near end of June,2018. We can not say enough great things about Croke Park. Just today we were again discussing their great service and food! The rooms were spacious, very clean and had welcomed air conditioning as it was warm when we visited.
  The Conseierrer was great as well, had the shuttle take us a another place to visit in IE. Called cabs for us, gave us so many tips of where to visit as well. 
 We dined at their restaurant in the hotel and my husband had the best hamburger he said he had ever. I had their fish n chips. They were outstanding! I used to work in seafood at a prior job, I can tell you it's the freshest we had in Ireland! We certainly plan to return here on our next trip. 
You will not be disappointed at all.",5,2018,07,13
211,Professional and Friendly,"Stayed for one night here for concert at the stadium.  Amazing hotel staff and management all impeccably dressed stood out from the offset. I thoroughly enjoyed my day here.   Friendly check in to start with excellent food and drink service and what topped the day for me was the BBQ,  making use of the excellent weather.  Then full screens inside for the football etc with gin bars and a main bar which was packed with serving staff honestly the best organised and professional hotel I have seen dealing with hundreds of customers in a friendly manner. Hotel room was so comfortable we were at the front facing the stadium and again the organisation of the hotel getting customers taxis etc we got into a very comfy bed with very little outside noise and with air con on such a hot night had a great nights sleep.  Amazingly organised given the amount of people they were dealing with.  Gorgeous breakfast with a great choice of buffet or a choice from the kitchen, I could not praise it enough and will definitely be back.",5,2018,07,11
211,Professional in every way.,"Stayed overnight for Michael Buble concert.  I cannot praise the staff and management enough.  What a delight which started with a warm friendly welcome at the reception and just got better and better.  The hotel was so busy and the staff coped with the whole day amazingly. All of our company commented on the very smart attire of the staff and management impeccable.  After meeting at the bar for a few drinks we had friends from England who where delighted they got to see the World Cup on every screen, one of our company even got to watch the GAA match being played that day at the same time.  Outdoor BBQ was amazing with the weather being so good.  After concert atmosphere in the hotel was great and ended the evening with a drink on the 4th floor executive lounge.  What a great hotel, professional, organised and a pleasure to stay in.  Have to mention the room, beds are so comfortable was tempted to stay another night!!
Will look forward to coming back concert or not.",5,2018,07,11
211,Excellent Hotel,"My wife and I stayed in this hotel for a long weekend. It is so close to the city centre, staff are very attentive, food was very good and the hotel itself was very modern. I would have no heistation in returning to this fine establishment.",5,2018,07,10
211,Overnight stay,"We stayed at the Croke Park Hotel for a concert and were very impressed with everything. We had a delicious BBQ in the hotel and the breakfast in the morning was delicious. The room was very spacious and clean, and the bed was very comfortable. Highly recommend this hotel for a trip to the city",5,2018,07,09
211,Comfortable and convenient place to stay,"Stayed here fro 4 days to attend a conference at the Cork Park Stadium. The location was very convenient and close to many good restaurants and the city centre. Rooms were comfortable, staff extremely helpful and courteous. Exceptional service by the concierge to help us with our sight seeing and day trips around Dublin.",4,2018,07,09
211,Delighted to get a room clearly as someone canceled in this fully booked hotel,"We are here for a conference and were only able to get bookings for 3 nights of our 4 night stay through the conference.  We didn’t think getting a room for the 4th night would be a problem but we’re told quickly that it could be because Michael Buble was playing in Dublin on Saturday.  The organizer at the conference found us one double room with two double beds at the Croke Park and we took it even though it was a little pricey.  We didn’t realize until we were walking up from the bus stop that the Croke Park was literally across the street from the concert stadium.  

Very nice hotel with a BBQ buffet available for dinner and breakfast included.  And as a bonus we could op b our window slightly and hear some of Michael Buble.  Pretty spectacular.  ",5,2018,07,08
211,Fantastic hotel,Huge comfortable rooms. Would be big in any American city hotel. Great service. Clean. Super comfortable bed. Superb bar. Great location. Nice gym. Nothing but great things to say about The Croke Park. ,5,2018,07,05
211,Lovely hotel,"Travelled to Dublin for my other halves 30th birthday. Extremely clean hotel with on site parking free. 

Advised it was her birthday and they put us on the executive floor and left a bottle of wine and lovely note in the room. 

Would definitely return",5,2018,07,05
211,Brilliant hotel ,"Just stayed at the croke park hotel Dublin, for 2 nights with my husband and two kids. I’ve stayed in a few hotels in Dublin but this has been are best experience so far. The staff were so helpful and friendly, the hotel is so clean, big rooms with everything you need, we had a great time would recommend 😀👍",5,2018,07,04
211,Great Hotel,"I am a frequent visitor to this hotel and on each occasion I stay there I am impressed by the quality of the hotel, the very warm welcome, and the quality of food  both breakfast and evening meal. The location is great for me as I can walk into Dublin centre in 20mins or so. Nothing is a problem for the staff there, they really do go out of their way to be helpful.",5,2018,07,04
211,Fabulous hotel.,"Enjoyed a fabulous stay here in June 2018. The staff were so nice from the moment we met Tommy on reception nothing was too much trouble, especially for the children. Great food and only a short taxi ride to city center. We do look forward to staying here again very soon.",5,2018,07,03
211,Top class in every area,"I am writing this review on behalf of my parents who stayed here for one night.  They asked me to specifically mention the receptionist, Hannah, who checked them in & out.  She went above and beyond to ensure that they were made welcome, they enjoyed the stay and had everything they needed (including taxis etc).  
The hotel was fabulous, spotless clean and had absolutely everything that you could need or want.  They also had access to the executive lounge with free tea/coffee, juice, fruit, bottled water etc.  
They had dinner in the bar and it was also amazing and service was top class.  
I don't think they will ever stay in any other hotel in Dublin.",5,2018,07,02
211,Nice,The hotel is nice especially if you’re going to the stadium. The staff was wonderful! Breakfast was pretty typical of one in Ireland. It is very large and easy to get lost however. The rooms are kind of dated. Overall good stay but the location isn’t the best. ,4,2018,07,01
211,Croke Park hotel,"As always this hotel was exceptional —I have stayed here many times and it is my favourite hotel in Dublin -from the friendly and genuinely caring staff to the cleanliness of the so comfortable rooms and the amazing breakfast —  I would recommend this hotel 100%
",5,2018,06,30
211,Great Place in Dublin,Loved staying at The Croke Park Hotel. We booked our trip through a travel agency so our stay here was part of the package. Super nice hotel in a great location and only about a 15-20 minute walk from Grafton Street. I had to have something sent to the hotel and the staff was fantastic to work with and help me get it back. ,5,2018,06,29
211,A Nice Comfortable hotel if you like walking - which I do,Exceptional hotel with all amenities and next to Croke Park Stadium.  Enjoyable - I found bar food to my better liking with big screen TV.  The dining staff was very helpful and offered suggestions when I asked.  Also the Concierge morning was excellent .,5,2018,06,28
211,FANTASTIC,"We stayed at The Croke Park for 3 nights and it was absolutely marvellous!! Rooms were beautiful and clean - the beds were so so comfy! Staff were so polite and friendly and the breakfast in the mornings was both impressive and delicious. 
It’s a short walk into the city and has awesome views of Croke Park (obviously) would highly recommend and will definitely bring staying again.",5,2018,06,28
211,Great stay ,"We stayed recently and my family and I rate this hotel very highly. Price wasn’t bad. It’s not city centre but not far away (about 10 Euro in taxi) from the main places one would want to go.
Room and decor are clean modern and very impressive. Food was grand if a bit pricey in the main bar. 
The staff were very helpful and friendly and great with the kids! We even managed to pop across the road  for a tour of the stadium.
All in all it’s somewhere between 4-5 stars with a slight issue about the price of food and drink in the bar but I suppose that’s par for the course in Dublin hotels.
Thanks for a great stay!",4,2018,06,27
211,Croke Park Stay,"We were greeted immediately in a very friendly way. The room was clean and very comfortable.  The breakfast was very good and we found the concierge to be very friendly, accomodating  and knowledgeable.",5,2018,06,26
211,Fab find,"Needed a family room for us and our teenage daughter, so this was one criteria for choosing Croke Park. As was location not too far from the city but with parking for the hire car. And special offer price. Staff so welcoming and customer service was superb. Loved the touches of wet hand towel on arrival for freshening up, bottles of water in room and free bottles of water on our departure. Would recommend, and would return.",5,2018,06,25
211,Billy Joel Concert,"This is our second stay at Croke Park Hotel, once again we were impressed. Our journey this time was to watch Hurling at Croke Park stadium which is straight across the road and to see Billy Joel in Concert at the Aviva Stadium.
The rooms are spacious and the hotel is easy walking distance to the city centre. Check in was great as we arrived at 10am and were given our room straight away even though check in is not until 2pm! The only criticism I have is the bar area, some of the bartenders are a bit over chatty to some customers leaving other customers waiting to be served for a while!! in fact after finishing speaking to a customer the bartender merrily went on clearing up completely ignoring my husband who by this time had been waiting 5 plus minutes whilst he finished his chat!! Hotel is clean and tidy, concierge are very good and helpful. Be warned if there is anything major going on at Croke Park Stadium, don't try and get a taxi when the stadium is emptying, you may have a long wait. We will see you again there is no doubt!",4,2018,06,25
211,A Stay in Croker,"Very convenient location if you are doing business in East Point. The hotel run a shuttle bus in the mornings to the business park.  Clean room, friendly staff and adequate breakfast choices. Priced within reason. ",4,2018,06,25
211,Great stay at the Croke,"Spent a couple of days at the Croke touring Ireland. Very happy with staff, facility, food, etc. I see a number of location comments from other reviews, bottom line is it's a 8 - 10 euro trip into the heart of Dublin.

I would return anytime.",5,2018,06,24
211,Fabulous stay! ,Love this hotel!! We stayed in the hotel over last weekend as we were going to the Taylor Swift concert and was so glad we did! Not only is it so convenient for concerts (just across the road) but the staff were wonderful and the hotel was just lovely to stay in. We ate dinner in the bistro and had breakfast - both of which were excellent. Special mention to Tanya who served us at dinner and breakfast - nothing was too much trouble and her friendliness was just so nice. We will definitely be back!! Thank you all so much �,5,2018,06,24
211,Excellent staff,A very genuine welcome at this lovely hotel with extremely helpful staff.  At check in we requested a room with a balcony and although we hadn’t reserved one a lovely balcony room was made available to us. We were treated as valued guests not just another booking.,5,2018,06,23
211,Excellent Service,"Visited Croke Park in a Business trip to Dublin. We were a group of 9 people.

211,Fabulous!!,"I’ve travelled to Dublin over the last 6 months and Croke Park is the best hotel I’ve stayed at in my time in Dublin. 

It’s not a central location - but the hotel is modern and very comfortable, it’s a very short taxi ride in to town. The rooms are a good size and well appointed. The staff are friendly and super helpful. I got the impression that the staff really like working there and enjoy what they do - which makes for a good customer experience.

My favourite hotel In Dublin - looking forward to coming back.

",4,2018,06,21
211,Wonderful experience ,"Unparalleled service from Ukarma, Clifford and Mateo at check-in.  Early check in was extremely valuable to my family after long night of travel.  

Breakfast very serviceable but more importantly for us, very fast, as we had an early train to catch.

We will return!",5,2018,06,20
211,Superb!,"I have stayed regularly at the Croke Park hotel and it is absolutely fantastic! Great rooms and facilities and the most professional, friendly staff! They go out of their way to make your stay special, cant recommend highly enough!",5,2018,06,19
211,Lovely hotel,"Great service. We arrived early - before check in time - but they found a room ready for us to check in early which meant that we could relax a little after our flight, a little thing but we appreciated it. 

Staff were very friendly, always smiling and greeting us. Lovely food there as well. We only used the restaurant for the breakfast but it was lovely - lot to choose from to suit what everyone likes, and staff quick to offer tea or coffee on arrival. 

Lovely hotel, but quite far from the centre but with hop on buses and taxis around if you need them it’s easy to get to. 

Overall a great stay and would stay there again.",5,2018,06,15
211,Wonderful Hotel,I absolutely loved staying at this hotel. The staff is amazing. We were celebrating our anniversary and they upgraded our room and sent up champagne.  I asked for a quiet room as I am very noise sensitive and the room was the best I’ve ever stayed in. The location is excellent right across from Croke Park about a 15-20 minuet walk from city center or a short taxi ride. The room was clean and comfortable.  The bathroom was enormous with a large soaking tub and really nice bath products.  Amazing bedding and pillows. We used room service twice the food was great and arrived quickly.  We had breakfast in the executive lounge which had a lovely view of Croke Park and a very nice continental breakfast.  The two women who staffed it were so friendly and helpful. The hotel bar is equally nice and well appointed.  This is by far one of the best hotels I’ve ever stayed in and the only place I will ever stay when visiting Dublin.,5,2018,06,15
211,Hotel with good location and friendly staff,The Hotel has  a very good location near airport and also near city center. The staff was very friendly and helpful. The drinks at the bar were very good and alos the lunch. a good hotel for a city trip in Dublin.,4,2018,06,14
211,Top Quality,"The Croke Park Hotel. A total pleasure to stay here, with everything about it top quality: the decor, the food and drink, all staff/team were thoroughly professional and friendly, room comfortable, clean, and home-from-home, atmosphere throughout so welcoming. Cannot fault Croke.  Glad I chose Croke. Will come again to Croke! ",5,2018,06,13
211,Regular guest,"I regularly stay at the Croke Park Hotel two nights every week and I have to say it is one of the best hotels in Dublin! From the hot towel at check-in to the wonderful staff in every area of the hotel, it is a truly 5 star experience!
The rooms are modern, clean and very comfortable with all the luxuries we expect in a modern hotel. As a regular guest I am privileged to have access to the Executive lounge which is a peaceful tranquil place to relax at the end of a busy day with complimentary teas, coffees, fresh fruit and soft drinks. Jacinta is a joy to chat to in the morning! Every time I check into my room, housekeeping have ensured that my request for a light sheet on the bed with no duvet is granted. I even had a call yesterday evening from the duty housekeeping manager checking if I was comfortable and if I needed anything to just ask! The beds and pillows are so comfortable too and a good nights sleep is guaranteed!
The staff at reception and in the bar are all wonderful and really go out of their way to offer great customer satisfaction!
Great job Croke Park! And I look forward to many more enjoyable stays!",5,2018,06,13
211,"Excellent stay, great staff","I’ve stayed here twice in the last few months for exams in Croke Park and on both occasions have had an excellent stay. All of the staff are extremely helpful - particularly a trainee staff member (I think called Mara) on my most recent visit, who was very obliging in moving me to a room with a bath so I could relax after exams! Rooms were clean, spacious and comfortable. Lovely room service, lovely breakfast, very accommodating with parking - would recommend to anyone and would love to stay again",5,2018,06,12
211,"Super service , expensive but clean and lively hotel","Super service by the staff at the Cooke park .

I must specially mention the beautiful and smiling service by NATALIA, HANNAH and the Concierge ( forgetting his name ) Krishna .

Natalia and Hannah ensured we have good service.  There 2 ladies were always smiling, happy to help change our room to a more suitable room and all with a snails . The hotel was clean , a key requirement I have when I am paying £ 200 approximately a day. The manger on Duty was considerate and the staff at the restaurant at morning was superb, they were busy, but they cared to recommend good  food options to my pre teen tired child. 

THE WHOLE STAFF WAS SIMPLY WONDERFUL. 
 
The hotel can do with a hotel cab service to the real city centre of Dublin.  And yes a swimming pool should be at a hotel of your standard.

Having said that , THANK YOU.
Natalia and Hannah , you both are the stars.

211,Lovely stay,"Lovely hotel, not too close to the  downtown area but just around a 20 min walk to O’Connell st. 
10 euro taxi ride.  Veryclean and lovely room.  Bathroom was excellent with separate glass shower stall and bath. Staff were excellent, nice bar area and restaurant, great buffet breakfast.",4,2018,06,09
211,My sons 10th birthday,"Well were to start, what a amazing arrivel, cake in are room for my son for his 10th birthday . Staff are out of this world just amazing, food amazing room amazing. Can't wait to go back. Thanks you all",5,2018,06,08
211,"Loved the hotel, little far out but quite nice","Enjoyed our stay very much! The hotel is great, loved our bathroom- deep long tub and a great shower. Room was very clean and well appointed. We had flown in from the US and they were able to check us on early which was so very much appreciated, staff was lovely! The breakfast was so good... yum! It is little farther out but it was easy enough to take cabs into the center around 11 euros.  Went to a very nice dinner in walking distance to the hotel called Fagans. ",4,2018,06,08
211,Regular guest at Crok Park Hotel,"I still almost weekly at the Croke Park Hotel and simply couldn't recommend it enough.  From reservations to check in to dining or room service, the staff are exemplary. The rooms are always spotless and well maintained with very comfortable beds.

I'd highly recommend and in fact frequently do!",5,2018,06,08
211,Ireland and hotel stay,"My husband and I traveled to Ireland and had an amazing experience. We stayed at The Croke Park Hotel when in Dublin, but traveled to many other destinations in Ireland, including Belfast. It was very nice! Kissed the Blarney Stone, walked the Carrick-a- Rede Rope Bridge, spent time at the Cliffs of Moher, dined at wonderful restaurants, Guinness Brewery and Trinity College. Too many other fascinating things and destinations to type here! You all must visit there!",5,2018,06,06
211,Outstanding Hotel And Staff,"What a beautiful hotel!  Rooms are clean, beds are comfortable, buffet breakfast outstanding.  You can also special order breakfast items (omelets, etc) if you like. This was the nicest hotel we stayed at during our seven day tour of Ireland.  I would like to give special mention to the concierge, Mr. Krishna Kumar, who was so personable and really helped us out with recommendations specific to our needs – thanks again.  We would definitely pick this hotel as our first choice if we ever find ourselves in Dublin again.",5,2018,06,06
211,Very friendly and big and clean rooms.,I enjoyed the stay in this modern and very friendly hotel a lot. Croke Park stadium just over the street. City center is a little bit far away but you can walk the distance. Take care NOT to have a room nearby the lifts.,5,2018,06,04
211,"Excellent, 1st class","Just returned following a great weekend in Dublin. The staff were exceptional, couldn’t do enough for you. Excellent breakfast, comfortable beds, highly recommended. Thank you for making our stay so special.",5,2018,06,03
211,Quiet escape from the city center,"We would not have normally stayed this far out of the city center, but we booked our trip late and this was all that was available.  It was just about a 15 minute walk to Temple Bar area so it ended up better than we expected.  

The breakfast was delicious, the rooms comfortable and the staff very friendly.  We checked in early and they were able to get us one of our two rooms so we had a chance to refresh after our long flight.   

The hotel was clean, elevators quick and the bar was well-stocked and open late.  We would definitely stay here again.",5,2018,06,03
211,"Comfortable, modern","We stayed here on the last night of a tour. Our room looked out on the stadium, which was fun. The beds were comfortable, the bathroom bright and clean. And breakfast at the hotel was very good. Overall, I was quite pleased with The Croke Park hotel. We were able to have the concierge arrange for a taxi into the center of the city the next morning and it was a quick and relatively inexpensive ride. So while this isn't close to all of the tourist action, it's not hard to get to the city center (and likewise with the airport).",4,2018,06,01
211,Croke Park Hotel,"The saying is, ""You get what you pay for."" This was the most expensive of all the places we stayed at this trip and was worth the extra money. The concierge and front desk personnel were phenomenal! Such a treat these days to have such superb customer service. We were acknowledged as soon as we entered the hotel. The check in process was quick. The rooms were nice and clean. The location was not too far from most of the attractions we visited. Parking tickets were easily validated each time we left. The elevators were secured, requiring a hotel key to operate. It was a great place to stay overall.

The breakfast was one of the best we've had after 4 holidays in Ireland.There was a great selection at the buffet with the option to order extras, such as omelettes or pancakes. We ate a sandwich for lunch our day of arrival and had wings the second night for a snack. The only suggestion I'd have is for the staff in the Sideline Bistro and Bar. We had to chase somebody down each time to order and to pay for our check. They weren't very attentive. Other than that, we'd stay at this hotel again if we ever return to Ireland. Well done Croke Park Hotel!",5,2018,06,01
211,"Comfortable, clean with helpful staff","Although it’s a little out of the way, it is a perfectly comfortable hotel with every modern amenity. The concierge desk was helpful and it seemed very family friendly without being overrun with kids.",5,2018,05,31
211,Superb!,"Just returned from a few days in Dublin, staying at The Croke Park. As we had taken an early flight, we arrived at the hotel well before the 2.00 p.m. check in time but we're able to leave our luggage and complete the registration form so that when we returned later, we were able to collect our key and go straight to our room. Hot towels to freshen up after out flight were a welcome touch. All of the staff we encountered during our stay could not have been more friendly or helpful. The atmosphere in the hotel is extremely relaxing and the whole place is spotlessly clean, beautifully furnished and tastefully dotted with touches of luxury, such as the gorgeous scented candles in the reception area and the White Company toiletries in the bathrooms. We had a room with two double beds, looking out on to the Croke Park stadium opposite. The room was spacious and well appointed. The breakfast buffet was excellent with a good selection of hot and cold options. We found Croke Park a good location for exploring the city. It is only about a 20 minute walk but there is also a shuttle bus that links to the Do Dublin hop-on-hop-off bus tour. Be aware, though, that the last shuttle into the city is at 10.30 a.m. and there is only one return trip at 6.15 p.m.",5,2018,05,31
211,Family try ,We stayed here in October . car park beside the hotel which brings you right into the hotel by lift. Hotel is spotless and rooms lovely . I was able to print off a boarding pass for my flight . Reception staff very helpful . We ate in the restaurant food very good and cocktails great too . Breakfast was lovely and plenty to choose from all self service. not in centre of Dublin but close enough and can get bus. Directly opposite croke park stadium . Excellent hotel . I would stay again ,4,2018,05,29
211,Trip to the Rugby in Dublin,"The hotel was booked by a friend of hours as there were four of us going to the Rugby with our wives. We therefore extend our stay by going on a Thursday flying back on the Sunday.
Although at arrival it seemed well presented including our Superior Room it gradually went down hill. The bathroom did not have a shaving mirror, no heated towel rail and no toilet brush. In the room the trouser press was a disaster with my trousers being turned into horrendous creases.  The buffet in the morning was cold and finally when we went into the restaurant on the last night the food was disappointing.
Finally one of our friend's room was close to the cleaning cupboards and was wakened  at 6.30 in the morning with the banging of the doors.
Not to be recommended.",2,2018,05,29
211,Amazing staff,"All the staff could not have been more helpful and pleasant. Definite 5 star for customer service. Hotel located opposite Crowe park stadium. Short walk into city centre, but further enough away so not be disturbed by noice. Fab breakfast",5,2018,05,28
211,"Nice, modern, but neighborhood is eh","We were delighted to be able to use our credit card points to book this nice, modern hotel - it was comfortable, clean, and bright. The main drawback is the location. It's a long stretch of the legs to Dublin's city center, and it's right across - I  mean RIGHT across - from the massive Croke Park Stadium. Luckily for us there were no events at the stadium while we were there, otherwise I feel like it would have been noisy and kind of nuts (not in a good way). But if you don't mind walking a bit, in other words don't need that Dublin charm to be found right on your door step but are willing to walk a bit to get to it, then this is a fine place to stay.",4,2018,05,27
211,Great hotel near the airport,"Our experience was great at the Croke Park hotel, we arrived on our trip last day before flying back home, so that the hotel was 10mins from the airport by car was a hughe plus. The staff was very pleasant and considerate. We were staying at Executive floor and the rooms and bathrooms were very comfortable and clean, we also got a complementary drink and continental breakfast. 
Overall a fantastic hotel with a convinient or inconvinient location depending on your needs.",5,2018,05,27
211,Croke park hotel ,Fantastic reception as we arrived at the hotel. Very welcoming. Room was spotless! Food was very good also. Withing walking distance to the city centre but would be about as far as you would want to walk to get to uther attractions. ,5,2018,05,23
211,Excellent stay,Stayed here for 2 nights with my family. 5* treatment all the way. The staff are all so pleasant and go out of their way to help you and make sure everything is good. The breakfast staff are the best that we’ve ever seen. I will definitely be back here!,5,2018,05,21
211,5 Night Stay,"We recently stayed at The Croke Park while we visited Dublin.  It was a wonderful hotel!!  We enjoyed the food, the breakfast was awesome, and the bar was good as well!  The rooms were clean and comfortable.  Every employee we encountered was amazing and we had no trouble.",5,2018,05,18
211,Excellent visit,"Thoroughly recommend the Croke Park Hotel.  We stayed last weekend Fri - Sun for a girls weekend.  The front desk staff were so welcoming and accommodating in putting 4 girls into connecting rooms, letting us view the options before we decided.  All the staff are so friendly and the hotel is extremely comfortable.  I'm used to staying in 5* hotels, but if you're looking for something a little bit more relaxed, without sacrificing quality, this is the place to be.  Central Dublin is only a few minutes away in a cab, which always arrived at the hotel within minutes of ordering. Loved it!",5,2018,05,17
211,Very nice ,"This hotel is very convenient for any event in Croke Park, just literally walk across the road! Parking, bar afterwards, it’s perfect. But actually it’s a very comfortable hotel for other purposes too. The bedroom was lovely, spotless and comfortable. The bathroom was very well appointed, both bath and walk in shower. Plenty of wardrobe storage, and lighting options. All the little things that make a stay more comfortable. Breakfast was good, freshly cooked omlettes a nice option. Service could be a bit more attentive however, look up and around the room at guests trying to catch you eye, rather than just set and clear tables. There shouldn’t be a queue to be seated either, with lots of free tables. I can’t imaging what it would be like when it’s busy. Prices are also expensive, but that’s Dublin, which is very discouraging for a return visit unfortunately. ",4,2018,05,15
211,Amazing Hotel,"My husband and I stayed at this hotel for three nights when we were in Dublin. The hotel was very clean, food was good, as were the amenities. The hotel itself was about a 15-20 minute walk to the center of town. You have an option to take the bus, but we enjoyed the walk. The room was clean and had everything we needed.

The front desk staff were kind and answered many questions for us. We even booked a few activities through their concierge and loved it! 

We would recommend and stay there again!",5,2018,05,14
211,"Good hotel, location a little too far from the attractions","I spent 4 nights in this hotel recently for a girls trip with a friend. The hotel was nice, clean, with good concierge service. The only issue is the location. being located nearby the arena, it requires quite a long walk to reach the part of town where all the attractions are. Aside from the hotel restaurant, the area offers only 1 other restaurant in the vicinity. If you don't mind the walk and don't need a lot of options for dinner, i would still recommend this hotel.",4,2018,05,11
211,"Off putting stains, none existent room service and payment difficulties.","I was really looking forward to this stay. I was working early Saturday morning and thought this would be an oasis of relaxation. I was so wrong.

There were issues with the payment of the booking, it should have been pre-paid, front desk staff were unhelpful and unsympathetic.

Then to my 'Executive Double' - nice enough on first appearances, but some very very dubious stains (pictured) were apparent on the chaise and the velvet throw on the bed was threadbare and bitty. Well past it's best.

So, to try make the best of it, I decided to order to my room the complimentary glass of wine my 'Executive room' entitled me to. I rang, I waited and waited. 50 minutes later it had not arrived so I called to cancel and head for the bar. As I was leaving the room it arrived on a tray at the door!!

I could go on, but suffice to say this was the very opposite of a relaxing stay and for the price was a HUGE disappointment.

The payment issues have since been rectified but it took over a week to get the held payment returned to my card.

I think I will give the Doyle Collection a swerve in future.",2,2018,05,11
211,Wonderful experience,"My wife and I enjoyed a wonderful and enjoyable stay.  The hotel is convenient, an easy stroll into centre of Dublin and the facilities are perfect.  Breakfast superb and staff are always friendly and helpful.",5,2018,05,10
211,Least favorite of the hotels we experienced on our trip in March.,"We had a disappointing dining experience here on our last night in Ireland.  The service was extremely slow, and when I finally got my meal I had to send it back due to complete lack of flavor.  I then ordered a salad to save time, the quality of which was not much better.  Worst food of our entire trip. The shuttle service outside the hotel to downtown was OK but made only one return trip to the hotel for the whole day, which was in the evening.  We wanted to return sooner so we took a cab back.  Hotel staff were not helpful in planning for the shuttle.  The elevator in the hotel was very confusing to use.",3,2018,05,09
211,Friendly staff especially the breakfast crew,Friendly staff especially the breakfast crew at this hotel in a residential area next to the stadium. Safe area to walk and in 15 minutes you will be on O'Connell street in the downtown section. Breakfast buffet is the same every day.,5,2018,05,08
211,Good,"Stayed here for 3 nights and room was clean and large. Got acces to the executive lounge with free snacks and drinks (water and juice). 15 minutes walk to the centre of Dublin. Breakfast was ok but no beans (English breakfast?) and the bread was not refilled regularly. I have the impression that after 9 am not everything was refilled. After all, no complaints.",4,2018,05,08
211,Excellent,Stayed here the 7th may. Staff were excellent and accommodating. The hotel is excellent and well appointed with all you would expect. It was my wifes birthday and they went to unexpected but appreciated extra effort on arrival. It was a really great touch. The next dau we were able to leave our car and bags and explore Dublin. Easy walk to the city. I would thoroughly recommended.,5,2018,05,08
211,Brilliant,"Had a brilliant time, stayed with my boyfriend for a night, the side line bistro was gorgeous and our server Chloe was so nice and polite. I will definitely recommend to family and friends to stay and eat.10/10",5,2018,05,06
211,Great Place to Stay,"First time staying here, and would def stay here again, the staff was excellent, friendly and very helpful.  Rooms where clean and was central to bus stop that will bring out all around Dublin. Bar was also nice for a night cap.",5,2018,05,02
211,Great week-long stay - ZERO Issues!,"We stayed here for one week while we explored Dublin and surrounding cities on tours. They were friendly from the moment we booked with them. I was able to email or call them for assistance before I arrived. We had great service the entire time. Clean rooms and facilities throughout the hotel. Buffet breakfast every day. The food overall is okay - but who really stays in the hotel to eat. The hotel is about a 15 minute walk from city center and a quick 5 minute walk to a bus stop that drops you off right on O'Connell Bridge. There is a restaurant a few steps away called Wallace Asti - Delicious!!! Ask for the special dinner menu! (free glass of wine, app and entree for 17.95). I had only one negative comment and it was the candles they burned at the front desk/entrance. I found them very overpowering and unpleasant, however thats a personal issue due my sensitive nose. Overall I would highly recommend The Croke Park Hotel",5,2018,05,01
211,Free parking and comfy beds,"We arrived on our last day in Dublin to find a welcome reception and awesome discovery of free parking. The beds were super comfortable too. The only negative was the location, as it was not near many restaurants, as there was only one close enough to walk, but it turned out to be a great Italian restaurant nonetheless.",4,2018,04,30
211,Amazing hotel with 5 start customer service ,"I was staying only one night . It was amazing , bedroom was very large and bed was so comfortable. Room was clean and look so good . Reception girls absolutely amazing - massive thank you to advice me that amazing hair salon The Space . Breakfast was so good . I will definitely will come back to this hotel . Thank you for such amazing memories. ",5,2018,04,30
211,Excellent hospitality,"We stopped by for lunch on a busy Saturday after a visit to Croke Park for an event.  As we had an awkwardly large group number, there was no space for us in the bar.  However, the staff were so accommodating, and found space for us in the seating area close to the reception.  Seats and tables were moved for us, and we were served very quickly.  The waiting staff were particularly impressive, managing to be very helpful in their lunch suggestions for the younger family members, and being very friendly!

We were very satisfied with our lunch choices, and the service was fantastic. 

I will definitely return for an overnight stay in the future!",4,2018,04,29
211,Excellent rooms,"Stayed at this property for four nights in April. Booked a room with two double beds and it was spacious, well equipped and very clean. The hotel is to the north of the city and the cost of the taxi from the airport was around 20 euros. Check in was easy and within a couple of minutes we were in our room. We stayed in room 134 which although on the first floor was quiet. 
All of the staff without exception were friendly and attentive, even a new waitress in the bistro who was on her first day at the hotel. The concierge was excellent and was very helpful with advice of where to go to visit and eat. The breakfast buffet was good and there was enough for a very filling meal.
The hotel is situated away from the centre but two pensioners could walk it in fifteen minutes even with a dodgy hip. All in all a good stay and very good value for money.",5,2018,04,29
211,"Fantastic hotel, well worth the visit!","Excellent service, food and accomodation. Would highly recommend. Fantastic location and would definitely stay here again! Special thanks to Deputy General Manager, Sean Reid for the outstanding VIP treatment. He goes above and beyond for his guests!",5,2018,04,28
211,Great people make very good hotel great,Though not in the center of all things Dublin Croke Park provides a first class lodging and excellent service for its guests. A short fifteen minute walk to O'Connell St. and on the green hop on hop off bus route you are at the core of touristy Dublin. Can't say enough about the staff that made our stay even more enjoyable. ,5,2018,04,25
211,Lovely hotel with lovely staff,"We have just had 2 nights at the Croke park Hotel and it was first class. Our room was spotless and the staff are a credit to the hotel and to themselves. From check in to check out, in the restaurant the bar and the housekeeping everything was done with a smile.

This was our second visit and we will def be back for a third. Thank you all for making  our weekend a very enjoyable stay.",5,2018,04,23
211,"Nice, standard large hotel","The rooms are fairly typical for a large hotel.  The hosts and concierge were all very helpful, in the standard ways you'd expect.  The only main complaint is the mini-fridge is strangely locked and once you get into it (we had some cheese we wanted to keep cool) everything is on weight censors so if you accidentally drop something it will automatically charge you regardless if you put it back.  But the front desk must get the complaint regularly because they simply removed the charge when asked. 

Locationwise, it's not super close to the downtown area, but we're happy to walk and never bothered taking public transport or ubers.  It was perfectly fine, even with our 5 year old.",4,2018,04,23
211,"Nice hotel, Wonderful staff","Our room was booked online and prepaid; there was some confusion upon our arrival about the room being prepaid, but the staff resolved it quickly. The room was fine- clean and well-appointed, but the real standout here is the staff. From the person who checked us in, to the housekeeping staff, to the girl at the front desk who called our taxi to depart for the airport, everybody was Wonderful. I cannot say enough good things about the entire staff. ",4,2018,04,22
211,Above and beyond!,"Great hotel, clean & of high standard within walking distance to the city centre. The staff were amazing especially one specific member who stayed with us for an hour one evening when our car battery died & helped us to get back up and running in time for our ferry. Nothing was too much and we can’t thank the hotel enough for helping to get us to our ferry on time!",5,2018,04,17
211,Best north side Dublin Box ticker,"If you are visiting Dublin and want to be close to city, near airport, and accessible with free guest parking with super comfort beds and excellent restsurant then this location hits the spot.  Although not ideal to walk to city centre there are transport facilities nearby. Opposite the football stadium and in a quiet residential area there is no major noise... except for match days or concerts. From arrival the reception staff were very attentive and efficient. Our meals were sumptuous and reasonably priced. Bedrooms were spotless with lovely linen and comfortable mattresses and ample pillows. The shower and separate bath was luxurious with ample hot water. Noise from other rooms was not an issue. On departure the parking ticket was processed and a bottle of water set us on our way. Would definitely stay again. Only wish the hotel did some deals for off peak times.",5,2018,04,17
211,Wonderful stay,"We received a warm welcome by the receptionist upon our arrival and were upgraded to an executive room. Oh my! This was the awesome surprise and it made our stay even more enjoyable. The room was lovely and big and the shower was spacious.Every one that we interacted with was so helpful and friendly! From the receptionists and concierge, to housekeeping and the staff at the restaurant. The hotel is about 15 min walk from the center, where we walked to most night to get some dinner. We definitely plan on staying there if we come back to visit Dublin!",5,2018,04,16
211,Great stay,Comfortable room.  Nice gym facilities.  Excellent breakfast included and parking.  Short distance to center.  Staff were friendly and made good recommendations for the rest of our trip. A bottle of water at check out was really nice too,5,2018,04,15
211,Dublin,"Can’t say enough about this hotel room nice an clean bed was lovely to sleep in pillows were brilliant . Good sized room as well as a bathroom with bath , shower and all the toiletries . Had kettle and tea an coffee and bottles of water . Breakfast was brilliant good variety we had the complete breakfast . Great hotel staff very friendly and always there cheery and to help . Just under €30 from Dublin airport to the hotel and round about €10 to the city . Will be coming again and staying in this hotel !!!",5,2018,04,15
211,ETB Learning ,"Very warm welcome from receptionist who dealt with me on arrival who despite it being very busy she and her two other Front Office personnel were extremely pleasant and had no hesitation in answering any questions asked. 
Room was very comfortable for to relax and prepare for meeting which was a great help to a weary traveller who had just spent 2 very business filled days in Brussels. We also found time to do a Walking trip of the city. St Nicholas's Church stood out amongst a lot of beautiful buildings.
Back in Croke Park Hotel and the service was beyond reproach and I would highly recommend it for the those wishing to have a comfortable base from which to explore North Dublin and still be within walking distance of the City of Dublin.
Food served was of the highest quality and very well presented as was the refreshing pint.
I have nothing bad to say about the Croke Park Hotel. Everything was excellent 

",5,2018,04,13
211,Key Card Problems,"Our room was acceptable but problems with our key cards somewhat ruined our stay. We needed to use our room keys to operated the elevators to reach our rooms. Unfortunately once inside the elevator we were shocked that the cards did not work and we were locked in the elevator!!! My daughter who is somewhat claustrophobic panicked when the doors would not open. Fortunately we were able to get out after a few minutes. Went to the desk and informed them of the problem with the keys and they did something to presumably correct the problem but it didn't so finally a senior staffer did something different and finally corrected the problem. Several others on our tour told us of having the same problem. After the first problem my daughter refused to take the elevator and used the stairs to and from the 3rd floor room so that ruined our stay which fortunately was only for one night. Aside from that the room faced the Croke Park stadium wall across the street so there wasn't much of a view. When we ate dinner there was a menu outside the Sideline Bistro which was different from the menu on the table. Apparently that menu was for the Sideline  ""Bar"" but no one in our party either didn't notice or it wasn't clearly stated. The person servicing our table gave us the menu we had seen and allowed us to be served in the Bistro where we were seated so at least the problem was promptly corrected.",2,2018,04,12
211,"Good quality, great service and good location","Stayed for 4 nights at the beginning of April.As many have said the service is first class with all staff friendly helpful and welcoming.Good sized rooms with super king-sized beds,very comfortable.Possibly the best breakfast my friends and I have had in hotels- the fresh honeycomb was a surprise and a treat; large choice , good ingredients and omelettes cooked to order if you want. Freshly made individual coffee if you don't like filtered ready made.Evening meals were also very good- well done chefs.It's a 10 minute walk to the top of O'Connell St or a 12 Euro ride into Temple Bar.",5,2018,04,12
211,Customer Service at it's Best,A group of 9 of us have just returned from a fantastic stay in The Croke Park Hotel.  This hotel and their team exceeded our expectations.  We checked in to a very busy hotel and nothing was too much trouble.  We  arrived early and were greeted with a huge smile by Anna at reception she made the children feel very special.  Nothing was too much trouble and this flowed through out the hotel.  It is very rarely that every department in a hotel would exceed expectation but The Croke Park Hotel managed to do this.  The bedrooms are very comfortable and well appointed and the hotel was spotless through.  This hotel team have got the balance right.  We had a fantastic night sleep and if you are looking for a hotel in Dublin you certainly could not look past this hotel.  Our group will certainly be back.  Thank you for making our stay special.,5,2018,04,09
211,Service and hospitality made our stay delightful.,"First trip to Dublin and couldn’t have chosen a better base for our trip. Just the right amount of informality for the guests to feel very relaxed.  There’s a balance of friendliness, service and efficiency that’s hard to achieve here and eludes most other hotels regardless of their status.  Wouldn’t hesitate to stay here again - highly recommend.",5,2018,04,04
211,Friendly and very nice hotel,"Our room was perfect, enought space inside and many facilities. bathroom was fabulous with bathtube and shower, great. Location was great in front of croke park stadium and 20 min walking to O'connel street",5,2018,04,03
211,Great location while attending conference,"My daughter was presenting at a conference at Croke Park.  She was offered this hotel or one closer to downtown.  I advised her to take the Croke Park because of the convenience to the conference and the difficulty of driving and parking in Dublin.  It was absolutely the right decision. She walked across the street to her meeting. We did not move the car for several days.  One day, we toured with the Green Do Dublin bus that picked us up right in front of the hotel.  Other activities we would walk or take a cab or Uber.  We got in the car when we were ready to leave Dublin.  The room was spacious and clean.  Breakfast was good.  It was everything that we needed.",5,2018,04,02
211,Brilliant staff,"Stayed at croke park with wife and two young children for wife's 40th over the easter weekend. While the hotel was perfectly lovely, the best thing about our stay were the staff. From the check in where they made little one's feel very special to the breakfast staff where nothing was too much trouble. Even dropped off some complimentary prosecco for wife's birthday and also easter bunnys for the kids. All in all a lovely stay and would definitely recommend ",5,2018,04,02
211,night in Dublin,"nice hotel convenient.
room nice and the bar food was good if a little pricey.
The breakfast was very good great choice.
The staff were the most helpful, friendly people I have met in a hotel 
Really enjoyed the stay.",5,2018,04,01
211,Great hotel,"Stayed over on st Patrick very clean and very help staff gave us a late check after all the snow came on the the Sunday, we didnt have any cooked at the hotel but the continental breakfast was very good, drink expensive but every where was as well thank you for a nice stay",5,2018,03,29
211,Nice hotel with a great location across stadium,I stayed there for a conference across the street in stadium. The lobby reception bar and restaurant are all providing good quality service. I recommend. The old city is not very close but also not far. Take a taxi. ,4,2018,03,29
211,beautiful stay,I stayed here a year ago for a book signing it's a beautiful hotel friendly staff modern and easy to get about and I really enjoyed my stay. the rooms are lovely and big modern and spacious and overall beautiful.,4,2018,03,28
211,NOT close to city center,"The place is really nice, good room with a few extra thrills, the staff are helpful, food in the restaurant in yummy, but it is NOT within walking of the historical downtown tourist area. Need a taxi to get there. In fact, the area surrounding the hotel is not upscale, but rather like the projects.",3,2018,03,28
211,Four Star Hotel,"From the moment we walked in to check in, we knew this was a special place. Everything was in it's place, and had the appearance of high quality accomodations. We were not disappointed! The room was just so comfortable. And the bed...best nights sleep away from my own bed I have ever had. The staff are top notch, and accomodating to high levels! I definitely recommend this hitel if you are in Dublin!!!",5,2018,03,27
211,Beautiful hotel right next to the stadium!,Enjoyed my stay in this hotel recently with excellent service and really good bar food. Myself and friends stayed and although the hotel was quite busy (due to a match) it had a great atmosphere and lots of space!,5,2018,03,27
211,Absolutely fantastic ,"We have stayed at Croke Park a couple of times now and each time gets better and better. The service we received this weekend was amazing and the staff couldn’t do enough for you. The breakfast in the morning is one of the best I’ve had and I’ve done a lot of traveling over the years.

",5,2018,03,27
211,Lovely stay,"What a lovely hotel. Staff were very friendly and helpful. Breakfast was gorgeous, my partner said there was only one thing missing BEANS. There was everything you could think of and all piping hot and tasty. Yes I would recommend this hotel to everyone. An enjoyable stay.",5,2018,03,25
211,Excellent stay,"We were here for two nights over St. Pattys day-which also happened to be a HUGE day for events at the Croke Park, however despite the extra chaos we felt well taken care of during our stay. The room itself was comfortable (we did have a small housekeeping issue but it was taken care of very quickly) and the location is great, we walked all over town from here. We ended up ordering room service several times, the restaurant is great!! The price was a little high, but again we were there on a super peak time. We would stay again. Thank you!",5,2018,03,21
211,Very comfortable Hotel,"The Croke Park is a very accessible hotel, both location wise and for wheelchair users. Disabled room is very spacious while the bathroom is fine and big with roll in shower with a fixed seat. The room has a wall mounted opener for the door. The only downside I found is the location of the room. It is on the third floor and a good 100 metres from the lift, which is not that far but when pushing on carpet and trying to bring luggage with you, it can prove to be a bit of a push if you are not the strongest. The staff are very friendly and co-operative and did offer to bring my luggage to the room. Food was very tasty in the bar and breakfast was tasty and filling. They offer 24 hour service to the room and a nice selection of sandwiches (at an extra charge of €5 for bringing it to the room), so a ham sandwich could work out at around €10 if you order to your room so depends on how hungry you really are after enjoying a few pints of the lovely pint of Guinness they serve in the bar. I previously stayed in the hotel and don't remember it being as expensive as it was this time around. B&B was €145 which was a few euro cheaper because I used a code provided by the conference I was attending. I have seen offers on their website that provide cheaper options so it is worth checking them out and also calling them directly.",4,2018,03,20
211,Fantastic hotel,"Came here over st paricks weekend. Lovely hotel, with very helpful staff!! Nice and clean and bedrooms are big with comfortable beds. Not too far from the town. Around a 15-20 minute walk. Very enjoyable stay! ",5,2018,03,19
211,The Croke Park Dublin,Very enjoyable stay at this well located hotel just a 20 minute walk from O’Connell street. We were greeted by Emma a very helpful and pleasant trainee receptionist. Our room was spacious with 2 beds.The bathroom was great with a bath and a separate walk in shower. Plenty of toiletries. Breakfast was a well stocked buffet with very prompt delivery of coffee/tea and toast. The freshly squeezed orange juice was a real treat. The free parking was much appreciated in a secure underground car park. Checkout was efficient with 2 complimentary bottles of water to help us on our way. Would have no hesitation using this hotel again if we were staying in Dublin.,4,2018,03,18
211,Excellent!! ,"We were greeted at reception by a lovely girl called Anna, she was so welcoming and accommodating. We were a little early but she sorted a room for us, and we had an upgrade which included the executive lounge. Very impressed by decor of hotel areas and the rooms, modern, funky and clean. Great products in the room. Super comfy bed! Staff were all lovely and friendly. Breakfast was delicious.. such a wide selection and I would say one of my best hotel breakfasts ever! Loved the honeycomb! A slight walk into town but it’s nice and easy. Loved our stay. Highly recommend. ",5,2018,03,16
211,"Good Hotel, Clean & Friendly.","We stayed here for 4 nights. The room was comfortable, very clean and the bathroom good. The staff were very friendly. The food in the hotel delicious and the breakfast buffet had a good selection. Would recommend a higher floor facing away from the Stadium. The hop on & off Bus is directly outside and very convenient.",4,2018,03,13
211,"Great hotel, great location, great experience","booked this hotel for weekend while attending a concert in 3arena.  facilities, staff and location were second to none. Delicious food in the bar & sunday lunch in the bistro was fabulous.  Room service menu also really good.",5,2018,03,12
211,Excellent service,I spent three days here and enjoyed some of the best service that I've had in a hotel. Nothing was too much trouble. The food I had at breakfast and in the bar area was very good. Add to that a high quality room with plenty of space and a bathroom with a separate shower and bath and I would happily stay here again. ,5,2018,03,12
211,Great staff; super stay,"Never done a trip advisor review before but was so impressed with the service my wife and I received at the weekend 
The lady supervising breakfast (Sandip???) was extremely pleasant and welcoming and all the reception staff were attentive and friendly 
Stayed here 2 years ago and received the same high level of service
We will always stay here when in Dublin ",5,2018,03,12
211,My lunch in Croke Park Hotel,I had an excellent lunch in the hotel  today served by Nicole. I found the staff and service excellent and will be returning again soon. Would highly recommend. Very resonably priced and no long delays in the service.,5,2018,03,11
211,Couldn't ask for a better place to get snowed in,"I was at the hotel for a conference that was supposed to be hosted across the street at Croke Park.  I say ""supposed to be"" because partway through the week the facility had to close due to weather, which resulted in hundreds of conference-goers returning to the hotel unexpectedly.  The staff took it in stride and put out a heroic effort to keep all of us accomodated.  Public transit was shut down for almost two days, so the staff couldn't get home and there were far more guests hanging around the hotel than normal.  You would never have guessed that from the service though.  Everyone was terrific.

On top of that, many of our flights out were cancelled, and the hotel was also helpful with that.  They allowed us to extend our stay at the conference rate, and let us cancel the extra night(s) at no cost if we were able to find an earlier flight.

The facilities were quite good and the food from the restaurant was better than I generally expect from a hotel.  I ate there several times and was never disappointed with anything I ordered.

Overall, The Croke Park has good facilities, a location that is reasonable walking distance from the city centre, and fantastic staff.  I was very pleased with my stay in spite of the trying circumstances.",5,2018,03,08
211,Croke Park Staff is Amazing!,"We were stuck in a blizzard at the Croke Park Hotel with the staff who were on shift being stuck there for 72 hours. They were AMAZING champs about the whole situation. Never a bad attitude, never a drop in their service level. I know I would have been cranky had I worked 72 hours straight, but they provided the best service I could think of. Cheers all around!",5,2018,03,08
211,Snowmegedon survival,"Thanks to all in The Croke Park for accommodating the OpenStack conference during storm Emma. The staff were incredible, sacrificing going home themselves to look after the guests. Although my stay had to be extended by  2 days, they were more than happy to accommodate me without hiking up the room rate. Very pleasant stay.",5,2018,03,08
211,They really care about you,They willing to give their resources out to help us when we stuck in the snow and don't have a place for our conference. They pay attention to you when you're in their hotel. That's the place I will like to stay when I visit Dublin again.,5,2018,03,07
211,Fantastic staff with very flexible management,"Every interaction I had with the Croke park staff was an excellent example of customer service done right.

My room was ready early and the staff encouraged me to take advantage of that.  The food in the bar was great and the coffee was just what I needed after 30 hours in transit.  They were very happy to help me plan a day of activities!  Once I got up to the room it was clean and quiet and well appointed.

While the hotel isn't in the CBD it's only a short walk/cab ride.  If I'm ever back in Dublin this is where I'll stay.

I'd expect the above to apply to any traveler at any time of year, however ....

We travelled to Dublin in Late Feb for a conference at the stadium across the street.  During the event the ""beat from the east"" hit Dublin and things ground to a halt.  Things closed and people were encouraged to stay inside eeek

Due to this we the conference facilities were closed and we relocated to the hotel where many of us were staying.  The Hotel staff not only accommodated this happily but they had fun trying to make things work in this chaotic situation.

Due to the storm many of the staff couldn't go home, despite this there were always kind, helpful and polite and many times complimented *us* on being understanding!  By the end of the event the hotel felt part of our community, even adopting our twitter hastags :D

While I certainly hope you don't get stuck in a snow storm, if you do ... do it at the Croke park hotel!",5,2018,03,06
211,Croke Park - Loved it!,"Loved everything about The Croke Park!  The room was spacious and beds very comfortable!  We enjoyed a nice big bathroom with a separate shower & bathtub so was able to enjoy a nice soak while staying.  Everyone we interacted with from the front desk, concierges' and restaurant folks were so very friendly and affable. We ate breakfast one morning and it was great, a nice selection of offerings!  The Croke Park is outside of the city center area, so be prepared to hail a taxi, walk 10-15 minutes to O'Connell Street, or catch a ride out front from the Green Hop On/Hop Off bus when you buy a tour pass, which can be purchased at the concierge desk. If by chance you attend a GAA event at Croke Park Stadium, you'll be right across the street and can take an easy 6-7 minute walk to the other side of the stadiums main entrance!  Unfortunately there were no events at the Stadium while we were in Dublin. Although we did not have a car, they do offer free onsite parking which would be a nice perk! I would totally recommend this hotel!",5,2018,03,05
211,Excellent service,"I was at the Croke Park hotel last week for a work event. As it happens, snow descended upon Europe and we were stuck in Dublin under the most challenging circumstances. I must say the hotel staff handled the situation with utmost professionalism, making us all feel welcome and making sure we had rooms/heat/food/internet during our stay so we could work during the blizzard. 

Under these extreme conditions I did not expect to have room service, yet they managed to deliver even on that front with the red weather alert in place (which means population are encouraged to stay home, instead of showing up for work). Food was available and delicious (whilst other venues were running low). They provided water and coffee for all the guests gathered in the lobby and common areas and made sure we had all we needed.

Many thanks for your help during this difficult time, you made our conference a success despite the weather.

Needless to say the service was also excellent before the blizzard, good front desk service and room service. Very welcoming and helpful staff.",5,2018,03,05
211,Amazing staff,"The room is pristine, the food is excellent, but what really stands out is the kindness and patience of the staff who had to put up with a large group of people unexpectedly stranded at the hotel due to bad weather. They even let us hold our conference there when the conference venue closed and were extremely accommodating to our needs and wants, and never stopped smiling. I'd highly recommend staying here just because the friendly people will brighten your day.",5,2018,03,05
211,Comfortable hotel that can handle a crisis,"I stayed in this hotel for a conference being held in the stadium across the road. Midweek snow came along and shut down the conference venue and pretty much all of Dublin. The hotel managed to host the rest of the event and keep up warm, comfortable and very well fed despite the weather.

Good food in the bar, excellent selection of whiskey, comfortable and plentiful seating.

Room and bed were comfortable. The bathroom had both shower and bath, and plumbing that worked well. The only minor complaint in the room would be that the TV seemed rather ancient for an otherwise modern seeming hotel.

Great breakfast buffet.

Staff universally friendly and helpful, despite also being trapped in the hotel due to the snow.

The hotel is not a perfect location if you're there to tour Dublin (it's a 20-30 minute walk to the temple bar area) but for something happening at Croke Part, it's great.",5,2018,03,05
211,Welcoming and comfortable,"The hotel staff are very welcoming and willing to assist.
The rooms are spacious, nice and very clean, with complimentary tea, coffee and bottled water.
Breakfast is excellent with buffet containing both Irish and international breakfast foods and drinks, all is freshly made with excellent service from the staff.
During the afternoons/evenings we spent some time at the hotel bar which has good selection of beverages (and of course fresh Guinness).
The hotel is located roughly 20 minutes walk from the touristic city center, and 10 minutes walk from a train station, and across the street from the famous Croke Park stadium, house of the GAA.
Highly recommended for anyone looking for a quiet location not too far from the center.",5,2018,03,03
211,Christmas Supper,Was there with a large group we had ordered sandwiches and mince pies as a supper treat.  There was a great variety of sandwiches obviously freshly made and more than enough for everyone.  The mince pies were to die for.  Loads of tea and coffee and obliging staff.  Highly recommend it.,4,2018,03,03
211,Very welcoming,"Felt at home from the moment I arrived to when I left. A room was found for me before checking, really helpful organising various transport requirements and the room was excellent.

Nicely located with good access to the Dublin city centre made this a great place to stay.",5,2018,03,01
211,Very pleasant stay here.,"Stayed in this hotel while attending a function close by. Met at reception by very pleasant & helpful staff. Accommodation was clean,warm & comfortable. Breakfast of the highest quality, great variety, warm & tasty. Any special requests dealt with no problem. ",5,2018,02,28
211,Little out of the way but lovely!,"We knew this hotel wasn’t central, and didn’t mind when booking (we needed to walk off all the meals and drinks we were indulging in anyway!) If we had a little stomp on, it would take about approx 20 minutes to walk into to the city centre. 

Staff were friendly and accommodating! Our room was as we’d expect - clean and comfortable with your usual amenities. 

Would definitely visit again and recommend! ",5,2018,02,27
211,Aine Maher,"Great Hotel and lovely friendly staff. It was one of our best experiences in a hotel. Lovely rooms, great food and above all brilliant friendly helpful staff. A great hotel practical in city center. We will be back ",5,2018,02,25
211,Comfortable hotel.Good bedrooms.,"Best place to stay if attending a function in Croke Park stadium.
Modern well kept 4# hotel.
Check in was troublesome as  key cards were not validated properly and would not work the lift.
Bedroom was spacious and had everything we needed including complimentary mineral water.A coffee maker would have been nice but the mini bar made up for it.
Shower was good and  toiletries were from The White Company.
We had dinner at another venue but enjoyed drinks in the bar with excellent service. Breakfast was good but service was a bit haphazard.Hotel was busy but staff did not seem to be able to cope.
No delph available at buffet, some items not replenished. Long wait for coffee and toast.On the plus side they had gluten free bread.
Would recommend if you need to be in the area.",4,2018,02,24
211,Fab!!,Great night in this hotel - 8 People - all happy - so convenient and close to croke park and such a great atmosphere- a great place for everyone to enjoy & Meet after the croke park matches - I’d highly recommend this hotel to anyone ,4,2018,02,24
211,Overnight stay,"Hotel was excellent, friendly service ( including hot towel on arrival and complimentary bottle of water on departure) ideally located for Croke Park as I was attending a function there, very impressed exceeded my expectation.. ",5,2018,02,21
211,The Liam,"We checked into the hotel for three days to celebrate my better half's birthday. Sophia welcomed us and she was very nice. 

We were allocated The Liam suite. This was a very nice treat for us. A lovely spacious room with a beautiful sitting room and very clean bathroom. The bed was so cosy.

We ordered room service breakfast  on the birthday morning and it did not disappoint. It was brill to have our breakfast brought to us with such a good selection.

We dined in the hotel for soup and sandwiches..this was ten euros each. Very filling and soup was really lovely.

We also dined in The Sideline bistro. We enjoyed fish and chips and salmon. The food is excellent and reasonably priced. 

The staff all sang happy birthday to my other half which was very kind of them.

For me what makes The Croke Park hotel special, are the staff. This is our 6th or 7th time here. 

On this occasion there were so many staff who deserve a mention as their service was excellent. Peter, Andrew, David and Maeve looked after us very well.

The breakfast team who worked very hard to ensure that we had a lovely breakfast. I particularly enjoyed my poached eggs one morning and a lovely omelette the next morning.

The blonde hair lady on breakfast reception (sorry we can't remember your name.
And Amy the duty manager who took time to chat to us. All the staff on breakfast were attentive.

There was one member of staff who really went the extra mile for us called Colin in the bar. 
We enjoyed his excellent professional yet so friendly service. He made us so welcome and took time to explain local places in Dublin we wanted to go to.

Two pints in Croke Park is roughly 11 to 12 euros..in Temple bar they were 15 for the same thing. A rip off in Temple bar.

Walking into Dublin takes only 15 to 20 minutes. We walked into Connolly Station in 18 minutes to go to Howth for an afternoon which was lovely.

Thank you Croke Park team. I can't wait to rebook and go back again.
Keep up the excellent work!!!

",5,2018,02,19
211,Great hotel,"From start to finish we'd a great stay in the hotel. The staff were some of the nicest staff I've ever encountered in a hotel, they were so obliging and interested in their customers. Sideline bar and bistro was great. I would highly recommend this hotel ",5,2018,02,19
211,Standards have fallen,"I stayed here for three nights recently based on previous stays here being very good 
Things were not so good this time. 

My check in experience was very poor and I was highly embarrassed by the staff member who dealt with my check in. Any other time I stayed here I paid upon check out however this time I was required to pay in full upon check in and advised to go out to an ATM to get cash. 

The bedroom itself was fine but the minibar was not restocked each day which is just poor housekeeping. 

The bathroom was mostly clean apart from dirty grouting near the shower and rusty screws in the doorstop. 

My experience in the Sideline bar one evening was appalling as I was simply ignored by all staff and none would take an order. The sideline bar is usually one of the best experiences of the hotel. 

Breakfast selection was very good and the quality of food excellent. Staff got my order wrong two of three mornings. 

I always used to speak highly of the Croke Park but would be less likely to do so now. 
",2,2018,02,18
211,Pleasant stay,We stayed at the Croke Park Hotel for three days. Our time there was very relaxing. It is in an ideal location if being in the heart of Dublin is something you might want to avoid. Staff were very helpful and attentive. They sorted a few minor issues we had with the bed linen. Lobby is warm and welcoming. Rooms are adequate size for a few days stay. Beds were comfortable. Free on site parking. Lovely hotel in many aspects. We will stay again if in Dublin.,4,2018,02,18
211,"""A nice hotel and friendly hotel.""","Welcoming and pleasant staff at the reception desk (Marijana), overall cleanliness and quality of the room. Nice hotel with good facilities. 
The hotel has a relaxing and quiet atmosphere which is perfect when traveling on business.",5,2018,02,17
211,A well run Hotel with lovely staff.,"Located on the Northside of the city just far enough from the centre to be quiet and peaceful at night. A good walk will get you into the city centre of to the local Dart (Train) station.  The Hotel is fresh and clean and really well maintained, beds large and very comfortable.  Staff are really well trained and could not do enought to make your stay a  pleasant one.  Free morning newspapers and a hearty breakfast rounded off our pleasant stay.",5,2018,02,15
211,One night stay ,"We stayed here overnight as my husband was going for surgery at the mater private early in the morning. 
Check in was excellent
Room was lovely would have preferred king size bed. Great to have walk in shower in the bathroom.
We ate in the bar. My steak and potato lack flavor but husband enjoy his burger. Not the cheapest for drinks and food.
Check out was quick. 
Staff friendly in all departments
Free car parking and was offered bottle of water leaving and free water in the bedroom ",4,2018,02,14
211,Functionally acceptable ,"I guess I would summarise this hotel as functional, if you're going to a game at Croke Park then it's going to be ultra convenient as you can literally walk across the road. The rooms are utterly devoid of any personality or interesting features and my window frame squeaked all night in the wind!

On a more positive note, the bar was lively and the breakfast was decent. I would stay here again.",3,2018,02,14
211,Lovely relaxed stay in comfortable Hotel,I stayed recently in this hotel with my wife. On our arrival we we upgraded tp a suite which was lovely. The staff were extremely friendly and helpful.They went out of there way to assist and nothing was too much trouble. The breakfast was excellent. We met a number of friends at the breakfast and there was no pressure on us to leave the restaurant but we  were offered extra tea and coffee a number of times. The hotel is within easy reach of the city center and is easy to get to. I would have no hesitation in recommending this hotel or staying there in the future. ,5,2018,02,11
211,Fantastic visit,Just come back from 3 days in Dublin staying at the croke park hotel..hotel really clean and not far from the main centre..staff all really friendly and the breakfast was spot on..the bar is busy especially on match days but for me it just adds to the atmosphere..fantastic trip and will stay here again for sure,5,2018,02,11
211,Exceptional Customer Service,"My wife and i were visiting Ireland for the first time to celebrate our 30th wedding anniversary. Part of our celebration was to see the Script in their hometown Dublin. As this was part of our bucket list we took advice from family who had visited previously. We couldn't have been more delighted with our choice of accommodation for which was a very special trip for us. From walking through the doors we were treated like celebrities, nothing was too much trouble for Siobhan and the rest of the front of house team, ""exceptional"". The friendliest of welcomes was followed by allowing us into our room around 4 hours earlier than expected,""exceptional"". The staff were genuinely interested in us and our reason for visiting, so much so that having mentioned our reason for visiting ALL the staff knew and were congratulatory, ""exceptional"". Steve the Concierge advised us on the the most suitable venues for us and arranged transport in the form of taxis for the evening and hop on hop off busses for the day ""exceptional"" As you can see a pattern is developing.  The hotel is in the suburbs of a capital city, The facilities more than adequate, clean and comfortable. What makes this Hotel is the staff. I would have no hesitation recommending this hotel to anyone if they were to receive the level of service that we enjoyed ""exceptional""   ",5,2018,02,10
211,Had a wonderful 3 nights,"Really good hotel- friendly staff, quick service, spacious rooms and bathroom. It's located just about a 15 min walk from the city center, easily manageable. 
We reached on a day when it was filled with people who had come to attend a match at the stadium, still everything was managed so efficiently. Kudos to the management team & staff.
The food at the Sideline Bistro & Bar was nothing short of amazing. Whether it was fish & chips, salads, chicken in mango sauce or their cocktails, everything was just awesome.
I'm quite sure this is where we will stay when we visit Dublin again.",5,2018,02,10
211,One of the best hotels in Dublin,"This is a very comfortable hotel, right next to the iconic Croke Park Stadium.
The rooms are very spacious and the food is excellent.
Plenty of space in the hotel foyer.
I would highly recommend it for any Business traveller.",5,2018,02,09
211,Dublin weekend,Great hotel friendly staff nothing to much trouble rooms beds facilities top notch bar prices good 10 minute walk to oconell street bars and shops round corner choke park stadium is opposite well worth a look around highly recommend  ,5,2018,02,08
211,"Excellent hotel, helpful staff",Literally accross the road from the stadium I was pleasantly surprised as it's an excellent hotel not just one in a good location. The bar was vibrant and the room was modern and clean. The staff make a good hotel and everyone I met was helpful and focussed on customer service. Comparatively inexpensive making it excellent value too.,5,2018,02,08
211,Perfect for a cosy night,"We have spent two nights there in a beautiful and spacious room with en suite bathroom. 
Everything was very tidy and clean. We felt most welcome and the staff was very friendly and always anxious to please.
The hotel is located just next to the stadium and it takes a 10 minutes walk to reach O'Connell St., 30 minutes for Temple Bar (10 min / 10€ with a taxi).
The only reason why one ""star"" is missing : the windows of our room let the noise of traffic and rail traffic in the room even when closed and with the busy roads quite far away. ",4,2018,02,08
211,Recent stay,Staff where excellent from check-in to checkout. I was greeted with a smile and a very high level of professionalism. As I moved around the hotel all staff were friendly and keen to be of assistance. At the excellent breakfast the staff made sure that I had everything I needed taking time to engage with me. I had a very good night's sleep in a lovely room.A great point about the staff was that they were not obsequious or condescending which are aspects I hate. There was a genuineness and a wish to assist. I will continue to use the Hotel for my Dublin trips,5,2018,02,07
211,Staff were so helpful,"Stayed here due to proximity to Temple St. Children's Hospital. Staff were excellent, so helpful. Room was clean, car park secure and hotel was spotless. Would definitely stay here again, based on my visit.",5,2018,02,06
211,A truly wonderful experience!,"From the moment we arrived to the second we left, every member of the Croke Park Hotel staff made my family and I feel welcome and special. We had 15 family members spend 10 days with us over the holidays, including our elderly mother, 3 teenage boys and a 10 year old and not only did the staff give us suggestions on things to do and see in Dublin, but they also seemed to truly care about us and made us all feel like we were at home. I was especially impressed with the concierge, Krishna and the Head Waiter, Colin who both took extra care and time making my mom happy and comfortable. I was a Guest Service trainer for the Walt Disney Co for almost 14 years and I must say that every member of the staff truly not only met, but exceeded my expectations. My only disappointment was that there was no Spa in the hotel, but that is a minor inconvenience and I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone coming to visit Dublin, especially if you want a place that isn't in the thick of it all, but very close to the action of the city. I look forward to coming back!",5,2018,02,01
211,The best beds everrrr,"A good hotel away from the noise of the city well least when the rugby is not on. Really liked this hotel its about a 25 minute walk to temple bar etc but its worth it for a good nights sleep. The rooms are large and clean, the beds are so comfortable and the staff are all very polite. A good hotel i would stay here again. Only thing to note if you do walk is to stick to main roads some of the streets are abit sketchy.",4,2018,01,29
211,Still a wonderful hotel but a revamp is needed,As a Regular visitor it's hard not to notice that some things have been the same for a very long time. The staff and the service are always second to none but a facelift is needed to maintain the facilities at the same level of the service.,4,2018,01,27
211,Business Stay,"Nice hotel. Ideal location if attending a conference, business event in the stadium across the road, not to mention for a big match. The lifts take a bit of getting used to. We should have  been told on check in how to operate the lifts, you have to use your key card.",3,2018,01,25
211,Great hotel,Stayed here for my birthday.  It is only a 20 min walk go the city centre and 5 min from some great little pubs. The rooms are well equipped big beds and large bathroom.  Free safe and wi fi which is unusual these days. The staff all very friendly. Would definitely recommend 😁,5,2018,01,23
211,As good as last year!,Had 3 days here with friends for their wedding anniversary as we did last year. As good as remembered! We had deluxe rooms so had use of the private lounge and complimentary continental breakfasts. We find the lounge absolutely brilliant for u winding after a busy day being tourists. The service throughout our stay was excellent and we even had a complimentary drink each every evening. Will be going back again!,5,2018,01,23
211,"Great hotel, nost of the people were awesome","Picked this hotel due to location and tripadvisor reviews, glad we did. The property is welcoming and nicely updated. The room was sizable, comfortable and well attended. Beds were comfortable and clean. It's still a 14 Euro cab ride to city center, so it's nice that the amenities make it worth it. The resteraunt and bar staff were excellent, as was the Concierge. Most of the front desk people are great, with the occasional crany one (not sure what was going on there?) We really liked this place and will stay again when we return to Dublen.",4,2018,01,22
211,Overall - Pretty Good.,"The good - nice big bed with lovely linens. Large bathroom with tub and shower. Good location if you don't want to be right downtown. Very clean. Friendly staff.
The bad - we had a hot water issue two days in a row. The lobby smells of musky air freshener - kind of sickly. Only one staircase VERY far from our room (so was the elevator but I hate elevators).",4,2018,01,22
211,Great Hotel and Friendly staff,"I have stayed at this Hotel many times and going forward will be staying there weekly. Very friendly staff, comfortable rooms and good choice on Bar/Bistro menu. You wont be disappointed. Good location also.",4,2018,01,22
211,very comfortable hotel,"Reception staff were very friendly and helpful. Food and service in the restaurant was exceptionally good. The room was a good size and the large bed and pillows were delightfully comfortable. Another huge benefit was the air-conditioning control in the room. The hotel may not be ideally placed for some but for me it was a an easy walk to the city centre. 
However, the one element letting this otherwise excellent hotel down was the size of the sheet, which was too short for the bed. It is not the first time I've encountered this in Ireland but I don't understand why good hotels risk their reputations by such foolish economies.",4,2018,01,21
211,New years visit,This hotel is absolutely gorgeous. Situated right opposite Croke Park stadium it's very easy to find. We got the bus from the airport for a couple of euros and just asked the bus driver when to get off. The hotel staff are super polite. They provide you with a warm flannel when you arrive which I found a bit odd? The rooms are cleaned every day the shower is powerful and the bath is big. They top up the toiletries every day with the white company products which is fab as they smell gorgeous. Room service is really quick. Beds are comfy but the duvets could be thicker we had to ask for another one each to double up. A lovely stay. ,5,2018,01,21
211,Good Location & Great Service,"Hotel is located within walking distance of City Centre. Offers a very helpful Concierge, great breakfast and staff are very welcoming. Front desk found out it was our Wedding Anniversary and left us complimentary Champagne in our room.",5,2018,01,20
211,Wonderful hotel and staff,"From arrival to departure, the stay was fabulous. I would rate the service 5 star and the facilities were brilliant too. Very comfortable bed. Also has a drink in the hotel bar in the evening and was great. We really enjoyed our stay and would return to this hotel again.",5,2018,01,19
211,Excellent,"The staff make you feel like royalty, parking is second to none, any amount of spaces,
and easy to access.
location perfect, 15 min walk to city centre,
and most of all 2 min walk to the Hoganstand turnstiles in Croke Park.
I'll be back.",5,2018,01,17
211,"Wow, just wow","Booked this hotel for my 40th birthday, 1st time we have been to Dublin and definitely  won't be the last, on arrival we were totally impressed with the hotel, staff was very friendly and welcoming, they notified us they have giving us a free upgrade to the 4th floor with free use of the executive lounge with free continental breakfast, wow we had this to ourselves 3 mornings, was a fabulous idea, tea coffee, orange or apple juice, ham cheeses, cold meats, bread buns all cereals and fruit, really made our stay, also the bar is fantastic on a night, great atmosphere and great staff, even coming round putting nibbles on the table, nuts and crisps, they really do go out of there way to make you feel at home, will definitely be back soon and will be recommended this hotel to family and friends, great place! ",5,2018,01,15
211,Excellent Hotel,"Wonderful beds, great staff too. Not close to city centre but on a positive note you can enjoy a taxi ride to the Center of the city by the best taxi drivers anywhere on earth. Free light breakfast as well. I would go back in a second.",5,2018,01,14
211,Recommended hotel,"Stayed for 4 nights on a business trip. The location is behind the Corke Park Stadium which can be noisy during a concert. I was walking in the neighborhood each night despite the fact it looks a little spooky. The rooms are very comfortable and clean. The bathroom is well equipped. The gym is well equipped, yet there was no weighting scale. The breakfast is very nice. Ask to allow entrance to the 4th floor launch.",4,2018,01,14
211,The Croke Park,"Spacious room and bathroom facilities. Adequate TV selection. Great bar lounge area with excellent waiters/waitresses who are very friendly and courteous. Not a large variety of beverages but more than enough to keep us happy. Food in the Sideline was very good and the proportions large. Same area is used for a breakfast space which also has an excellent variety of hot and cold dishes. Outstanding porridge.
It is a fairly flat 20 minute walk to the city which is also a flat walk. Taxi is around10 pounds. The location is near the football ground. The hotels in the city suffer a bit from the noise of the new trams which have constantly ringing loud bells. Beds very comfortable. Only area to look at was we open the windows at night as the air-con is a bit to hot even on lowest setting with donas provided.",5,2018,01,12
211,"Great hotel, great location","Excellent facilities in this hotel.  The food was excellent both in the bar and restaurant.  The rooms were extremely comfortable, had a great sleep. The bathroom was spotlessly clean.  My only regret was I didn't book a 2nd night.  Will definitely be back.",5,2018,01,10
211,3rd visit ,This hotel is so good always a great welcome and breakfast is one of the best. Both mornings asked for pancakes and they were so good. We had food in bar and it was also good. We got roomservice one night as we were tired from shopping!! It was quick and hot and nice and deliver with a smile. Friends joined us on last morning for breakfast and they were impressed as well. So well done and a special mention to a trainee Evan (hope I have name right ) as they were 7 of us we asked him a number of times for tea etc and he did so with a pleasant attitude etc Good training always shows we hope to be back again in 2018,5,2018,01,10
211,Over night stay,"Myself and my husband stayed here for one night in early January.
The hotel is situated across from Croke Park stadium and within close distance to the city center, a short taxi ride will get you into the city center and can be organized via the concierge desk.
The reception staff made us feel very welcome and couldn't be more accommodating.
The bar and restaurant staff are attentive and excel at their jobs.
The rooms are clean, tidy and comfortable. We had a wonderful nights sleep.
Breakfast the following morning was delicious with lots of different foods on offer to cater for all tastes.
I would definitely stay here again.",5,2018,01,10
211,Best Business / city Hotel break hotel in Dublin !,"I have been staying in this hotel for business and on occasions pleasure for over 10 years , it remains the most consistent in terms of high levels of cleanliness , quality , service and has an excellent resturant. The staff will go out of their way to meet your needs , it outperforms on every level some of the better know branded hotels in the city centre and on the southside. It is certainly worth the taxi fare wherever you plan to vivst in Dublin.",5,2018,01,09
211,"Very comfortable, good gym","We stayed here for a few nights before Christmas. The room was very comfortable. We had a room directly behind the lift, which at first we were worried about. However the lift is quiet and you can barely hear it, and it didn't wake us up on any occasion. The ensuite was huge with a large bath. 

The gym is on the ground floor of the hotel adjacent to reception. As hotel gyms go, it is well stocked. There are some dumbbell free weights, some weight machines (chest press, lat pulldown), a multi-exercise frame rig and cardio machines (cross trainer, treadmills, bike, etc). The only thing missing is a standard exercise bike, the bike in there is a recumbent one. A few new yoga mats in there would also be good.

Parking is secure and free for residents and you can walk to the top of O'Connell St in 10 to 15mins (which we did many times without issue).",4,2018,01,08
211,Everything perfect,"A very recommended hotel (kind staff, very good service, wide and clean room and varied and complete dining). Easy access to downtown and parking facilities. We will repeat in our next visit to Dublin.",5,2018,01,07
211,"Terrible Dining Room Service,Very dissapointed","Stayed at this Hotel on a Friday night in early December, Check in was fast and the staff were friendly, Our Room was very nice, Dressing Gowns and slippers provided, Nice bathroom, We had made a reservation for dinner at 7, We  went down at around 6.30 in order to have a pre dinner drink but the bar and the front lobby was absolutely packed with absolutely No seating anywhere, A supervisor from the dining room saw us and We told her we had a reservation for dinner at 7,she said we could come into the dining room immediately and have our pre dinner drink there, which we did, We ordered our drinks, A bottle of wine a glass of Heineken and  mine was a pint of Smithwick's We,waited for about 20 minutes before we called a waitress,to ask had they forgotton our drinks,This was a different lady to who had taken our order and again gave her our order,after about 10 minutes our order arrived,but mine was not smithwicks it was a larger so I said to the waitress that is not smithwicks and she asked me was I sure, to which I replied, I am sure.She went away and came back with Smithwicks, Our order had been taken after we had arrived and we had received our starter about 15 minutes earlier so we waited for another 15 minutes for our main course to arrive,we were all having steak 3 well done and 1 medium-rare, There were 4 in our party, I had asked when ordering for extra onion rings, which never arrived, The steaks were all on the Rare side my partners had to be sent back so it could be cooked some more, I ate mine as I don't mind Rare, My daughter and her husband ate theirs as they were so hungry, we ordered another drink which took another 20mins., we were more than 2 hours  in the dining room, when we came out the bar and lobby were still packed and no place to sit down, Went to the men,s  room and it was flooded, We had to leave the Hotel to go out to a local bar for drinks, When we came back Crowds had gone and we got a seat near the bar but I think the party goers who were there earlier had moved to another function room as we could hear the music, After we went to bed we were awakened around 2 to 2 30, with people partying,  There were two waitresses on duty and what appeared to be a supervisor as she was in and out. Service was not bad It was Terrible.",3,2018,01,06
211,Lovely relaxing New Year ,"Stayed here for 3 nights over New Years weekend and couldn’t fault it at all. Good location, about 15 min walk to O’Connell street but reception will arrange a taxi and are very helpful. The hotel is very modern, clean and relaxing. The rooms are ideal for a mini break and the housekeepers do an amazing job looking after you & your room. 
Would recommend this hotel to other people and it’s somewhere we would certainly stay again.

Also loved the smell of the candles in the lobby, should of asked the scent of them really ",5,2018,01,05
211,Nice Hotel for a Stay in Dublin,"When we arrived the staff was very helpful and gave uns a feeling of being welcome. 
The room was clean, everything we needed was there. When we had questions, we could just ask someone of the staff and they would be happy to help us out. 
The location is across the street of the Croke Park Stadium in the borough Drumcondra. The borough is not the best to stay in, honestly... but it was okay. Near the hotel are two Spar Supermarkets and a Tesco. Some restaurants are around too, if you don't want to eat in the hotel. 
We ate in the Sideline Bar once and it was really delicious. The staff there seemed a bit off with me and my friend sometimes. We think it was because of our younger age, we are eighteen and nineteen years old, but that should not be a reason to be dismissive. Overall the Bar is really comfortable and the drinks are nice for a night in. 
The location is a bit far away from the city centre of Dublin, we had to walk about thirty minutes everyday, if we did not want to take a taxi or a bus (busses are a strange thing in Dublin to us Germans :D) 
Overall we had a great experience in The Croke Park and Dublin itself, we would do it all again!",4,2018,01,04
211,Lovely hotel but check bill before leaving,"Hotel was lovely, staff were very friendly and helpful. Rooms are lovely and the facilities in the hotel are really nice. Hotel bar lovely for a drink before you go out and isn’t overly priced in comparison to city centre. Bed and pillows weren’t great and have come home with a pretty sore back and neck but the room was lovely besides that. Upon leaving we were given a bill of 55EUR for things we didn’t have and tried to charge us for items out of the minibar we didn’t have but once we clarified this with reception the charges were removed. There was also a discrepancy with the total amount to pay at check in which was resolved with showing our booking confirmation. Overall a nice hotel and would return. ",4,2018,01,03
211,New Years! ,"Came here for New Years and we had a really good stay. The room was large..bath, walk in shower, iron, mini bar. Bed was a queen and really comfortable. We stayed here I’ve New Year’s Eve and they had entertainment on, we never went but thought that was a nice touch. Has a nice bar with large tv’s dotted around. All in all a nice stay. ",5,2018,01,03
211,Bar food,"Ordered a medium to well done striploin steak €15 and received / charged in full for a medium rare fillet steak (with obvious blood showing) €25  Tough & dry meat.
Young staff serving all foreign. They should check orders in case of misunderstanding.",1,2018,01,02
211,Excellent,Stayed here over New Year. All staff in the hotel were excellent. The receptionist (Manjana) was very helpful. Service was exceptional.Location is within walking distance for all main attractions in the city. Would definitely recommend a stay here. Food in the hotel was varied and good quality.,5,2018,01,02
211,Lovely stay,"We had 3 nights here in between Christmas and new year. Easy to access from the airport on the local bus. The hotel smells amazing in the recption area. The staff are super friendly and polite. The room we stayed in had a good sized bath and separate shower. Beds were really comfortable and the room was spotlessly clean. Full Irish buffet breakfast was also very good, didn't eat here at night but the food looked and smelled very nice. The bar area is nice with a great selection of drinks and cocktails. Excellent hotel overall.",5,2018,01,02
211,A Good place to stay,"We stayed one night whilst meeting up with family, Very friendly staff, lovely clean room and excellent breakfast. Just a little out of town but we knew that when we booked, The only reason I have marked it down was that the room although large, clean and adequate just reminded me of a glorified travel lodge type room! Think I expected just a little more from my money. Apart from that small disappointment all in all a very good stay.",4,2018,01,02
211,Fantastic Hotel,"We were impressed with this hotel. Breakfasts which were included in the room rate were excellent. It was a buffet style and there was plenty of choice of both hot and cold food. We have had drinks in the hotel bar one night which were a bit expensive but still cheaper than in Dublin,. The room was very clean, the bed prettyvcomfy and the shower powerful and always hot. This hotel is really good value for money, highly recommended.",5,2018,01,01
211,Anniversary stay,"Stayed there on our wedding anniversary .on 30th of december..got upgraded to Liam McCarthy suite were we spent our first wedding night 4 years ago...everything from start to finish was perfect ...room, lunch , staff breakfasts I could give you guys 10 stars if I could...hopefully I will c u all again  next year on my anniversary 😁",5,2017,12,31
211,A lovely stay,"Im not a demanding guest and didnt need any extra service but hotel met my expectations and I will for sure come back in the future. Clean, modern rooms, helpful staff, good location. Can recommend for sure",5,2017,12,30
211,Best service EVER!!,"When my husband and I arrived at the hotel, it was after a fairly stressful first day in Ireland.  Adjusting to the driving there was a bit more than we had expected and we were both very tired when we checked in.  Unfortunately, my husband also passed out just as we were completing our check in and fell hard on his back (breaking 3 ribs, as we later found out).  The managers were ""on the spot"" and called for an ambulance, but stayed with us until help came.  Throughout our entire week there, these same two managers checked on us frequently to make sure we had everything we needed and making sure my husband was doing well.  One of the managers even gave us his tickets to the Gaelic football game that was playing right across the street at the stadium (very generous of him- and we couldn't walk far at that point, so the game was a welcome distraction).  Just the best place, with the best people!  Can't say enough about the Croke Park hotel!",5,2017,12,25
211,Incredible experience,This hotel is incredible. Is not so far from the center. Extraordinary service and attention of the people. The food is delicious. I really recommended the breakfast. The relation between price and quality is extraordinary!!!,5,2017,12,24
211,Good location - near and far enough to the city center,"Friendly personal, clean rooms, cool lounge (in the 3rd floor) - free parking (!) ...
We enjoyed our 5day stay here a lot - the way to the city centre is just a 10 minute walk - the room (backwards) is calm - the way to an authentic pub is very short ...  ",5,2017,12,22
211,Wonderful welcome,"My daughter and I had a brief overnight stay at the Croke Park. Not only was it very good value, the welcome of the staff made us feel most at home. The hotel is spotlessly clean everywhere.  Parking was excellent - free, covered basement parking and plenty of spaces. Rooms were lovely - spacious and comfortable with a good sized bathroom and good quality toiletries. The beds were very comfortable and even though our room was right at the front of the building, it was very quiet ensuring a good nights sleep. Room had mini bar and complimentary bottles of water when we arrived. The hotel is 15 min walk from O'Connell street but the desk will order taxis if required. As we were there for a short period of time we did not eat in the hotel but will hopefully stay longer to avail of the hotel facilities, as there are plenty of spaces to sit and relax.",5,2017,12,20
211,Fab hotel in Dublin City,"Very welcoming, comfortable and luxurious hotel. Staff are very friendly, rooms are big, clean and modern with a great location in Dublin city.  I would recommend this hotel to anyone travelling to Dublin at any stage of the year. ",5,2017,12,19
211,A home away from home,The staff of the Croke Park hotel go out of their way to make every guest feel welcome and it is one of reasons why I continue to stay there each time I am in Dublin.  The rooms are very comfortable and quiet and ideal if you are working.,5,2017,12,19
211,Fabulous hotel with the friendliest staff,Booked this hotel for our family Christmas city visit. Loved loved loved the hotel. From the minute we checked in we were so well looked after right down to the little details like providing colouring books for the children. I had requested a quiet room and although the hotel was in the throes is Christmas parties we dis not hear a peep all night. The hotel was a high point for the children and this is down to the staff and their attentiveness and personal touch at each point of contact. Cannot recommend this hotel highly enough and will be back. ,5,2017,12,18
211,"A bit out of city center, but that has advantages","Obviously, one's first choice if attendng an event a Croke Park and spending the night....like a U2 concert, as it is literally across the street. There is a complimentary shuttle that takes you to city center with many departures each morning, but nothing returning after dark. Hotel is very, very nice as is the staff. Upmarket with a fabulous breakfast buffet. We needed to get to the airport for a mid morning flight, so that was part of our consideration for location. The airlines use this hotel for their international crews as well.",4,2017,12,17
211,Christmas party stay over,Was attending a Christmas Party at the stadium across the road. Room was clean but very cold when checked in. 1 room key did not work. Breakfast service was efficient. Hot breakfast food could have been warmer. Staff were helpful. Ok if you need somewhere convenient to stay. Recommend room only option. €16 pp for breakfast is not worth it - even though it's cheaper at €10 pp as part of b & b package. ,3,2017,12,17
211,Clean Friendly Quite Hotel,"Clean and Friendly. Hotel restaurant prices were very good. As was the food. Staff knowledgeable and friendly and very helpful. Nice, big lounge with a huge! projection screen TV for soccer games. Hop on / Hop off (Green) Bus picks you up at the Hotel lobby between 9? and 10:45am. 2 day pass is best at $20. Excellent Great Stay, Water pressure in the shower could have been a tad more forceful. But temperature for the hot water was fantastic and long lasting. ",5,2017,12,16
211,Perfect For Its Location,"I stayed here for the first weekend this month with my parents for an event which took place in Croke Park itself.
First of all, location - if your destination is the stadium itself, be it for a match, conference or concert, it could not be any better: you are actually in the shadow of it. But the location has its downside too. It has parking, which is key for so many, but I travel by rail, so it is to the real city centre that I am accustomed. I am not used to having to get taxis, and I found they were working out at €15 a go, though that was at night and to/from Heuston station. I wasn't there long enough to figure out the buses, though being just off the North Circular Road they must run incessantly.
The hotel itself is lovely. Perhaps the reception area is a tad clinical, but the bar, restaurant and most importantly, rooms, are all very nice. The place is immaculately clean, and most importantly, the bathroom. I found this to be a real jewel, with a beautiful shower. A fabulous touch was the toiletries provided: generally I wouldn't use these things to clean the bathroom floor, but the White Company was the luxury here!
The storage space was great, which meant a lot, due the the number of outfits we were carting, and the beds were most comfortable.
Had a very pleasant dinner, and breakfast was most enjoyable. The choice was fantastic, as was the quality, with newspapers available.
The hotel's key strength is as everyone is stating, however, and that is its staff: they are impeccable. The enthusiasm, professionalism, and overall pleasantness is remarkable. From the cooperation at my initial booking well in advance (when I was obliged over expiring credit cards in the meantime), to the bar and restaurant, to organising taxis, to our checking out, they could not have done any more, nor done it any better.
So very, very hard to beat.",4,2017,12,15
211,Fab hotel,"Fab location , close to town. The room was very large and really nicely decorated. stayed around christmas time and the common areas in the hotel were really nice also. On checkout was given a bottle of water which was a really nice touch given the excesses of the previous night!  Staff were very friendly. ",5,2017,12,13
211,Excellent Staff. Lovely Hotel,"The Croke Park hotel is a fabulous hotel. The food, car park, rooms and general ambiance are all lovely. But the staff are what makes this hotel fantastic. My husband was ill during our stay. The staff were so kind to us and did everything they could to help. We hope to stay again soon and would highly recommend this hotel. Thanks for everything.",5,2017,12,12
211,Special birthday treat,"Thank you, for help making my sisters birthday one I hope she remembers. Stayed here from the 8-11th December. The hotel was friendly, the rooms kept clean( especially with my 20 year old kids), had dinner on Sunday evening in the hotel, which was delicious, especially with one of our party being gluten free. Breakfast was lovely and relaxed, overall a well recommended hotel. Thank you.",5,2017,12,12
211,Family holiday to Ireland. ,"Very good hotel. Firstly young lady who booked us in was very good. Thank you Emma! She reorganised our room to suit our original request with no fuss at all and made us feel welcome. Hotel fairly well placed if you don't mind a short walk into town.
Easy to get to airport and motorway. Rooms a little tired but overall can recommend it for a stay in Dublin.  Once again thanks to Emma. I have a staff of 40 in my job role at home and involved in customer support-she would be an asset. ",4,2017,12,12
211,Very welcoming hotel,"I stayed here for a week in August with my sister, my daughter and my niece (teenagers).  The location was convenient; it was a bit of a walk to the main part of the city, but it gave us exercise walking back and forth each day.  The service was excellent.  On the day we arrived, there was a hurling match. We were contacted ahead of time and advised on how best to get to the hotel as the area around the hotel would be very crowded.  When we arrived, our room was not ready, so we were going to wait at the bar.  However, we were told that it would be too crowded there and so we were escorted to a lounge where we could wait.  This was much appreciated as we were tired from a long air journey.  This is just one example of the the service:  all the staff we encountered were kind, helpful and generous. I would definitely go back.",5,2017,12,10
211,Great location & staff,"Great hotel in a great location close to town. Had a bit to eat in the restaurant downstairs and have to say good food and good value. Staff are very friendly and helpful especially when with two kids in tow... parking is good and we were able to take a walk after check out and still come back later and get our ticket validated. 
Only draw back is if you are staying in a room to the front Jones Road is particularly busy on a workday morning so expect some road noise. Rooms are well equipped with modern layout high quality bathroom accessories and very comfortable.",4,2017,12,08
211,A Bargain in Dublin!,"Stayed here for 2 nights with a great friend, we booked a room with 2 doubles, couldn't fault the room or hotel, I normally stay away from hotels geared towards the corporate traveler, and we were concerned that the location was a bit out of town, but we needn't have been concerned.

From the airport, the hotel was a 5 minute walk from the airport buses first stop, and for heading into town, we used the dublin ""boris"" bikes and the nearest bike park for those was again a few minutes walk away.

Breakfast was good, but unusually for me I preferred the continental.

We booked months in advance with flights and the total price was a steal",5,2017,12,08
211,Short but satisfied stay.,"Stayed at hotel for a work Xmas party in Croke Park so stay was brief and blurry! Staff at reception lovely and also having the well needed and plentiful buffet breakfast the next day, the staff couldn't do enough for us....would highly recommend this hotel to anyone needing to stay in the area.",4,2017,12,07
211,Lovely hotel,"Only here for an overnight with work but thought the hotel was great. Room was lovely and airy, loved the few biscuits on the tea tray and decent tea and coffee. Bathroom big and good size bath separate to shower. Even the toiletries were nice. So handy to be able to leave car there while attending conference in croke park. Staff exceptionally nice and helpful. Got up to late for breakfast but if the standard of everything else anything to go by, I'm sure it was good. Will come back here with my family. ",5,2017,12,05
211,Lovely,"A quick one night stay on business and from what I saw everything was too notch from check-in to the rooms to meals.

I would return without hesitation.

Just a word of caution though, the room card and the lift activation mechanism are temperamental.",5,2017,12,05
211,Fab. ,I have stayed here twice now for trips out of Dublin Airport. I cannot recommend it highly enough. All staff are super friendly and the food in the bar is delicious and good value. Beds are so comfy and bathrooms lovely. But staff make it. They must get great training. Credit all round. ,5,2017,12,04
211,"2nd time round, still great!","My wife and i stayed here agin this year for our wedding anniversary and , once again, we where very pleased!  Room was large, clean and tidy.  The staff are friendly and helpful. The location is out of town bait but not a problem for us as we dont mind a 15 min walk or 10 euro (i think) taxi in/out.  To get to the hotel from the air port just take the shuttle and its a ten min walk for the stop...very easy!",5,2017,12,04
211,Christmas Party,Just home from a fantastic party at Crock Park and a fabulous stay at Crock Park Hotel .This hotel is wonderful the staff at check in and check out are so wecoming .The room was beautiful so clean and fresh .Would highly reccommend this hotel and all i can say is if Carlsberg did Hotels 😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊,5,2017,12,02
211,"Very comfortable, great staff","Very comfortable and clean room. The staff are very friendly and welcoming. Breakfast was fantastic, they have a special local breakfast, porridge to which you can add honey and local Irish whiskey if you like, everything else on the menue was wonderful as well. The lounge area was very comfortable, very nice staff who were welcoming until we were ready to retire for the evening. I would definitely stay here again.",5,2017,12,01
211,Very Comfortable Hotel,"Stayed with my husband for 3 nights 24th - 26th November, 2017 on a B & B basis at a cost of €373.60.  This is our 3rd visit to this hotel and we recommend it highly.   The decor is modern, the staff are friendly, food is very good and there is a lovely ambiance throughout.  The rooms are spacious with lots of storage and large bathrooms with a really comfortable bed & lovely soft pillows. Car Parking is free for hotel residents.   If you are fortunate to have a room on Level 4 you will have access to the Executive Lounge which is a great place to lounge around & relax or read the papers while having a complimentary tea/coffee/juice/water/fruit/cookie.  It is a 15 minute stroll to O'Connell Street but taxis are readily available and there is a public bus service nearby.",5,2017,11,28
211,Great staff!," This hotel was nice enough. The bed was comfortable. The extra large bath towels were nice. Provided in the room were:  iron, ironing board,  pant pressing valet, bottled water (still and sparkling), tea/coffee/ hot cocoa (kettle, cream, sugar, etc), shampoo, lotion, shower gel, and soap (not a fan of the scent and no conditioner, thankfully I brought my own), hair dryer, safe, and mini bar fridge. I found it a little awkward blow drying my hair without a mirror. There is a full length wall mirrow, but no outlet near it and the only outlet in the bathroom is for electric shavers. I made it work. We had a king size bed, it was on wheels and moved easily if no one was in it (like when I tried to sit on it to blow dry my hair). Plenty of closet space for longer stays. TV was fine. The breakfast buffet was nice and the food good. The staff was very nice and helpful throughout our short stay.  They have a small business center and a very nice gym. Of note the shower had quite a bit of mildew. Overall I would stay here again, the hop on hop off GoDublin tour bus has a morning and early evening shuttle that picks up/ drops off right out front which was great for our 2 day stay. There are also several places to eat within walking distance! ",4,2017,11,28
211,Birthdayweekend,Excellent venue close to all main sites.  Great friendly staff and excellent food party of three stated in a very comfortable room.  No noise at night excellent sleep -very helpful reception arranged taxis -bar food great as well,5,2017,11,26
211,Good option for Dublin City,"This hotel is located 20 minutes walk from Dublin city attractions. The neighbourhood is ok, is excellent if you are driving, since they have a free parking and good access to major roads.The rooms are spacious, clean and comfortable, do not expect a nice view from your room. Breakfast is just ok, they should improve food selection and service, since it is very slow.",4,2017,11,23
211,Dublin Visit,"It was my first time travelling to Ireland, and I couldn't have been more pleased that I chose The Croke Park while staying in Dublin. From all aspects one would expect while staying at a top-notch hotel, Croke Park easily exceeded all expectations. I was particularly impressed with the cleanliness, along with feeling comfortable, and safe. But, it was the kindness, and help from a particular employee (Valentina) who made my stay at The Croke Park a truly memorable one. Oh, and Paige too... thank you!",5,2017,11,21
211,Great Stay,"We stayed 17-20th November, for my birthday. Lovely hotel a nice stretch of the legs from city centre. Just a 10 min walk away. Lovely room (417) good size and quiet. 
We only ate breakfast in the hotel and it was very good, nice selection and very fresh.
I would certainly book this hotel again, loved it.",5,2017,11,20
211,Very good staff,"The staff was very nice, respectful and gave us the extra. We asked about restaurants and how to travel around in the city, the staff gave us very good tip and did have good knowledge about Dublin. The rooms was very good, clean and big bathroom. Good beds.",5,2017,11,20
211,Exceeded Expectations,"This hotel was recommended to us by a friend, the price was good value & I expected to get a regular type of business hotel. But it totally the opposite, beautiful place , lovely staff, relaxed bar, a good pint. great big carpark. I met the Manager Alan , really nice guy , couldn't do enough for us. 
 I will be back again, Thank you. ",5,2017,11,20
211,Perfect for business trip,I arrived on the red eye and at 4:30 in the morning the front desk manager was able to get me into a room and was sensitive to my bleary eyes and the need for rest before a business meeting later that morning. Great service and very nice rooms. ,5,2017,11,20
211,Great value and service.,"Highly recommend staying at the Croke Park Hotel, staff were exceptionally helpful, the beds were so comfortable it was hard to leave!! Breakfast was also excellent. Underground car parking was easyI would definitely stay again.",5,2017,11,20
211,Excellent overnight stay & very friendly staff,"Overall stay was excellent. From check in to check out all staff were helpful and very friendly. The room has everything you need for an enjoyable stay. Great for business and leisure stays, with Croke Park Stadium just across the road. 

Was given some delicious chocolates before bed and a bottle of water on check out.

Thank you all for the fab service :)",5,2017,11,18
211,Business Overnight stay,This hotel is located very conveniently for travelers from Belfast as it avoids having to negotiate a lot of city traffic as it is near the motorway. Excellent bedrooms and bathrooms. Friendly staff. I ordered a newspaper which wasn't delivered but the front desk got one for me immediately.,4,2017,11,17
211,Excellent !,Warm friendly check in staff with comfortable rooms. Bar service is top class and accompanying bar food is delicious and reasonably priced. Excellent location for Croker &  city center is a stroll away !,5,2017,11,17
211,Great food,"My daughter and I dined in the bar on the 15th November and we were both very happy with the food.  It was just beautiful from the Striploin Steak to the Pork chop.  Such a tasty meal and the service was top notch.
Great place to stay and great location.",5,2017,11,17
211,Superb ,"Stayed here as part of the business trip, have attended a conference in the croke stadium which is right opposite of the hotel. Hotel is absolutely amazing, the staff is great, check in and out is smooth and pleasant. Bistro which is in the hotel is enjoyable also. 5 star and than some.",5,2017,11,17
211,"Excellent location, staff and room. ","I stayed here for two nights for a business conference in Croke Park. The staff were extremely friendly and especially helpful. The room was very comfortable, clean and quiet. We ate in The Sideline Bistro which was very nice. A heart felt thank you to all the staff. ",4,2017,11,16
211,Very nice,"Very nice, clean and modern hotel. Very friendly, helpful and knowledgeable staff. It is situated a little out of the city centre, but the shuttle bus for the hop-on-hop-off tour was very helpful. The sideline bar was very nice and cosy and reasonably priced.",5,2017,11,15
211,Fab Hotel,"Always enjoy our stay. Hotel is spotless, food is lovely, staff are very friendly and hotel is within walking distance of the city centre. Car is secure in underground car park. Would highly recommend staying at this hotel. We are looking forward to staying here on our next visit to Dublin.",5,2017,11,14
211,Such a Lovely Hotel,"Some friends and I stayed here this past weekend as we were attending J Con at Croke Park.

The staff were so so friendly and helpful, they really couldn't have done enough to make sure we were having a good time. They were chatty and professional and, as silly as this sounds, not at all condescending or rude about the many cosplayers walking around (which unfortunately has not been the case in other hotels we've been at for conventions!) Really can't compliment them enough.

The rooms were gorgeous and spotless and the cleaning staff were so friendly and accommodating!

I would sincerely recommend this hotel to anyone staying in Dublin. It's clean, modern, reasonably priced and overall just so friendly and welcoming.

We didn't get the chance to try out the other amenities available within the hotel, unfortunately, but we had a look around and everything seemed just immaculate.

Thanks so much for the great experience!",5,2017,11,14
211,A real 4 star hotel,"Everything was absolutely fine in this hotel. The food (in the bar) delicious, the staff absolutely friendly and helpful. the rooms AND the bathroom are really spacious. If I should come again to Dublin I would choose this hotel again.",5,2017,11,14
211,"Great hotel, good location","Great hotel for a weekend getaway - if going to Croke Park, this is definitely your hotel! Short walking distance from city centre. Great staff, really friendly and helpful. 

Roomservice bit overprized, but nothing too bad.",5,2017,11,14
211,Super customer Service ,"I stayed with my family on Friday night the 3rd of November.  We booked the GAA package where evening meal and Croke Park tour was included.  
We were made feel very welcome on arrival. The children aged 9 8 and 5 were immediate given colouring books and crayons.  Our room was spotless and spacious for 5. 
We ate in the bar where we were given the restuarant menu as it was part of our package. We felt this was less formal with the children. The meal was very enjoyable. The lady in charge in he bar was very friendly to turn children.  
Sadly when we arrived home on Saturday night we realised my son's beloved soft toy didn't come home with is. My son was devastated.  I phoned the hotel on Saturday and Sunday and nothing was logged as being found in our room. I sent an email on Monday and Clare responded saying she would contact the laundry Company.  On Wednesday morning I got a mail to say ""doggy ' was found at the laundry Company and was now back in the hotel keeping her company in the office.  
Doggy arrived home today to a very excited little boy with photos of his extended stay at the Croke Park Hotel. 
It was a very thoughtful touch and above and beyond the call of duty. 
Many thanks to all. ",5,2017,11,13
211,consistently meets expectations,"Regularily stay at this hotel and the premises and the staff always meet my expectations.
Very comfortable and relaxing place to stay.
Breakfast is top class.  Bar food also excellent with tasty and good value options.
",5,2017,11,13
211,"Great hotel, worth the walk!","We came for a weekend to Dublin and we had looked for a relatively low cost deal (inclusive of flights and hotel). Although this hotel wasn't in the centre of Dublin (shops, bars) we knew we'd be happy to walk and we weren't disappointed!

When we arrived all staff were attentive and acknowledged us immediately. We checked in to find we were on the executive floor (worth booking if you're contemplating it). The Continental breakfast was lovely and consisted of bread, cheeses, meats, cereals, fruit, dips and fridges of bottled drinks to help yourself to. Drinks in the room were replenished on an evening and there was also a turn down service which was unexpected but a nice touch.

On our second day we left our bags with the concierge so we could walk around without been weighed down. We collected these at the end of the day before heading to the airport. Very stress free.

Location was fine for getting to O'Connell Street (roughly 10-15 minutes brisk walk and not too hilly). The bus stop back to the airport was about a 5-8 minute brisk walk. We didn't use buses to and from the hotel so can't comment but there were taxi's arriving very regular.

Only tiny niggle is we booked a twin room and got a double but only realised we couldn't separate the beds when we came back at 10pm to find it was one large mattress (we didn't point it out to reception as we didn't want to lose the use of the Executive suite). Luckily we know each other well enough but maybe worth a phone call before hand if it is a business trip (colleagues sharing).

Would stay here again.",5,2017,11,13
211,Excellent Staff and Fcilities,I would highly recommend this Hotel. The breakfast is fantastic.  Variety and choice brilliant. Staff in all areas were polite and helpful. The food in the Bar is very tasty and good choice if dishes. Rooms very clean and bright,5,2017,11,13
211,A great place to stay,"We stayed for 2 nights 1 evening meal and breakfast on Saturday and Sunday all included. I have to say the food was lovely. Situated about a 10 minute walk from the city centre it is an ideal place to stay. There is a shuttle bus that takes you in to the city if you chose. The staff were very friendly and helpful, the rooms large and comfy and very welcoming. Tea and coffee were in the rooms if you wanted it. We had access to the executive room where we also had food and drink constantly available to us. In my opinion a great place to stay",5,2017,11,12
211,Good Place in Dublin,The Croke Park Hotel is a good place to stay to visit all there is to see in Dublin. It is a short taxi ride to sites in Dublin city. Traveling in October was a great time to travel to Dublin as it is not peak season and the crowds were smaller other times of the year.,5,2017,11,10
211,Overperforming,"Arrived for 3 days attending a conference at the other side of the street. And decided to stay close to the conference. Had no expectation about Croke Park Hotel; maybe thats why I am so positively surprised. This hotel simply is so professionel. From the checkin to the maintenance, the bar in the evening, the cleaning etc. And the staff - so friendly. But mostly - I have never experienced a hotel so focussed on maintaining its premise and facility. You feel there is a managementteam behind focussed on the details. In it self the hotel is not a 5* hotel (would say 4*) - but due to the clear over-performance I decided to give the fifth star.
In my opinion the hotel is in walking distance from the Temple Bar area. Ap.. 25. min on foot.",5,2017,11,10
211,Great stay,"Really enjoyed our stay. Friendly staff, lovely clean rooms and plenty of space. Location ideal!! For sightseeing and family stay. Loved the stay. Ideal for visiting croke park. Food at breakfast and in bistro was excellent",5,2017,11,08
211,Wonderful stay,"Exceptional, friendly, helpful staff, excellent room with very comfy bed and excellent facilities.The restaurant was excellent and the hotel is positioned only a short walk from the wonderful city centre.
Would definitely recommend. *****",5,2017,11,08
211,Fantastic hotel!,The Croke Park is a fantastic hotel. It does not look like much on the outside but do not judge the book by it´s cover... Friendly staff mixed with a welcoming atmosphere makes this hotel well worth a stay. We had access to the executive lounge and that is also something I can recommed. The breakfast there had everything you needed to get the day started. The hotel is located about a nice 15 minutes walk into the city centre. ,5,2017,11,07
211,Friendly and attentive.,"Exceptionally friendly and engaging staff throughout the hotel. Very clean and stylish. Too many televisions in the main lounge for me, but the ambience just about there, given the big screens. Rooms very clean and specious. My only negative comment was the overnight meal trays left in the corridor for far too long, which ruined the look of the corridors. The staff were fantastically friendly and helpful, and I can highly recommend a stay. The prices in the bar are very reasonable, and the lads all knew their whiskeys. Overall, a very nice, clean and exceptionally well run establishment.   ",5,2017,11,06
211,Just Lovely,"I stayed here with my husband and daughter for two nights. The room had two double beds and was very spacious. The bathroom bigger than we expected. Our stay was home away from home. The negative aspects are shower at the end of a tub with a dip in the tub beneath shower. This I navigated gingerly to avoid slipping. And the room is obviously more family oriented than catering to my vanity. The mirror fogs in the bathroom and is too far away and not lit overhead to really use for make-up so I navigated around the room searching for my light with my tiny mirror lol. And the hairdryer hardly reached to the full length mirror by the door. .moan over.. We ate on one of the evenings in their restaurant. Lovely service from Raj(hope I got the spelling right) gorgeous Sancerre and fabulous Gambas and fillet steaks accompanied by yummy cauliflower fritters, asparagus and sweet potato fries. Heavenly. The breakfast was just lovely. We all appreciated a bain marie dedicated to fried eggs. Nice touch not every hotel offers. Would highly recommend a stay here with the imposing legendary Croke Park virtually at the front door. ",5,2017,11,06
211,Second trip felt used,"I booked Croke Park and had visited before. It was part of pkg. I called and e-mailed 5-6 mos. prior. As I had 3 rooms for 2 I was requesting a change of 3 in a rm. to be closer, one had never visited before. They gave me a price if I wanted this and as I was giving up 3 rms. I said I would think on it after they named add'l fees. I saw they upgraded people for just a birthday. I was trying to negotiate a van instead of 3 separate cars, passports, and working 4 jobs at 69! I guess they sent me a e-mail I receive 250-300 a day in April. The trip was Oct-Nov. we were planning costumes for Hallloween which we wore at hotel inside and out. Anyway we arrived in van and stayed in 2 rooms. One for 4 and one for 2, 3 beds total. When I checked out they wanted 160 add'l euros saying they sent a e-mail concerning this. I saw there price but never confirmed I wanted add'l cost. I just stated ok I see the price. This was not what I expected upon leaving, then then showed me a e-mail they sent me. Receiving so many a day I probably figured it was a confirmation, I work every day....after a long time at front desk and missing luggage after 2nights we wanted to be on the road. Manager settled on 80 euros and I left in van. Place is nice, which is why I came back, we took cabs everywhere from outside. Concierge Kumasi is really helpful....e-mail if you have further questions I have a bad taste in my mouth....",3,2017,11,06
211,Our favourite hotel in Dublin,"We love Dublin. We have stayed in The Croke Park Hotel a few times now and it is lovely when some of the staff know you.
We stayed on the 4th floor. We were given a very warm welcome from Valentino. Hope I am spelling your name correctly. Pleasant and helpful.
Our room had a nice view of the canal.  The Croke Park hotel must be commended for the cleanliness of the room and bathroom. Very cosy bed, another reason we love our stays here.
Breakfast is excellent. Plenty of choice. We ordered poached eggs and beans which was served quickly. Owen and Clodagh served us. They both looked after us very well. Love they have time for a wee chat. I must also add in Kiva the chef also was so friendly and helpful.
It was lovely to catch up with Sean, the operational manager and Alan, the gm. Both very busy people but took time out to say hello.
It was our first time meeting Orla, the food and beverage manager. She went the extra mile looking after us.
It takes roughly 15 minutes to walk into Dublin. A taxi costs roughly 8 euros back in.
Can't wait to return to The Croke Park Hotel. Looking forward to our next stay.",5,2017,11,05
211,Great Choice,"Overnighted in Dublin returning from a month long holiday. Croke Park was an excellent choice. Very comfortable, high service property, and we stayed at 11 others in the past month.

The downtown and airport are both easily accessed.

Great service, you can tell they work at it.

Only regret was their policy on the Expedia VIP amenity we received, two drinks in the bar. Apparently only applies to their house wine and beer. Rather than limit a perk, they'd be better served not extending it at all. Very chintzy. Totally took the spirit out of an otherwise appreciated gesture.",5,2017,11,03
211,Lovely hotel ,"Stayed here previously and returned knowing it was a good hotel. Rooms are clean and comfortable, the bathroom us large and modern and the staff were all unfailingly polite and friendly. The cocktails are also excellent. It is a bit of a walk into the city centre however once you get your bearings, it is straightforward. All in all, a very pleasant stay. ",4,2017,11,03
211,Amazing ,"Myself, my husband, and our two children stayed here after a bit of a disaster at another hotel. The room was lovely here, Sean the concierge was just a star and so helpful. Hot towels on arrival were a wonderful touch, and I went for a lie down when we arrived as we were all totally shattered. The service was first class and the hotel had a lovely atmosphere. Nothing was too much trouble and help offered with a smile. This hotel is a perfect stay of peace in a busy city. We walked to a great restaurant and enjoyed a hot bath when we got back. The kids were settled and happy. Breakfast was fresh and delicious with a large selection available. We will definitely be back down again.",5,2017,11,02
211,Treated will utmost respect.,We like everything about this Hotel! The greeting was warm and very friendly. The check in process was immediate. The whole hotel was spotless. The food and drink was very good. The wait staff very attentive. Would highly recommend staying here!!,5,2017,11,02
211,Simply Exceptional,"There are very few places that make you feel really ""at home"" as Croke Park Hotel and its facilities. Try it and you will not regret it, starting with location, hotel amenities and people, especially people!",5,2017,10,31
211,Great Hotel,"Brilliant hotel with handy car parking and a great location, the food and rooms where great, the receptionist Marlyes was great at checking us in quickly and helping us with directions and arranging taxis for us on what was a busy weekend, will be back again next year would not stay in any other hotel in Dublin but this one.",5,2017,10,31
211,Very good experience,"Stayed in Croke Park Hotel.for an event in Croke Park. I just walked across to Croke Park from the Hotel. Bedrooms were above average standard. Bed super comfortable. Really comfortable bed. Bathrooms are simple but very spacious and have everything you might need. Staff very friendly, helpful and really professional. Great standard of training amongst the staff. I had a really good experience throughout my stay and would highly recommend this hotel. ",5,2017,10,31
211,luxe hotel,"This hotel has a luxe business kind of feel. Amazing big, comfortable beds, great view of the Stadium next door, fantastic shower, consistent WiFi, great service, and exceptionally clean. It's a pleasant 15-20 minute walk to the centre of Dublin, in a nice, quiet area that gives you a bit more of a sense of residential Dublin.The staff were fantastic. Food in the pub wasn't particularly exciting, but it was decent, and the breakfast was pretty elaborate if you're into such things.",5,2017,10,29
211,"Still good, but don't stay in a room on the ground floor","I have been back in the Croke Park after a few years and it was like being back after a week or so. The hotel is well maintained, the check in was smooth and friendly and everything looked good as in my previous stays. However for the first time, I was given a room on the ground floor, I didn't even know there were rooms on the ground floor, and this is the problem! I got a room that is not really a  standard double bed room, but more likely a meeting room (actually the room was in the meeting rooms area) that can be turned into a bed room when the hotel is full. Nothing wrong with that, but it should be a real bed room! My room was pretty large, with a small (140 cm) ""double"" bed, which was clearly a foldable bed. If I were alone, I could have lived with it, but being with my wife we found the bed quite narrow for two. Furthermore the room di not have some standard furniture, or accessories, like, for instance, a proper desk, and a luggage holder. In other words, the room was bare and the bed uncomfortable. The bathroom was small, but, at least, with everything you need. The breakfast in the morning was good, as usual.
Overall I will still recommend The Croke Park hotel, particularly if you have a car, but be aware: refuse to stay in a ground room!",3,2017,10,29
211,Room was great but food not so good,Visited with my wife on business.  The location is Brillant and car park is handy. The staff are friendly and our room was clean and well equipped .the shower was powerful and the bed was comfortable . The breakfast was good but the food we had on 2 evenings was not great. The beef was warm not hot the desserts we were served had not thawed on both evenings. ,3,2017,10,28
211,"Great value for money with excellent staff, food and facilities. Highly recommended","This is now the third time I have stayed at the Croke Park. What a comfortable inviting hotel it is.
Food quality is exceptional, staff are friendly professional and knowledgeable.
Prices for accommodation and food / drink, very reasonable indeed.
I recommend this hotel for Dublin.",5,2017,10,27
211,"Great location, great service","This is a place that has got it right.

The location is great - just outside the city centre, close to the airport, with access to a spacious carpark (that you get free as a hotel resident). Simple to get in to the city on foot, by bus, or taxi - or if like us you are using the hop on/ hop off tour, there is a shuttle from the front door.

Our room had two double beds, that was comfortable for a family of four, the decor was fresh, the bathroom an excellent size with a separate shower.

On day one we had lunch in the lounge, simple, but delicious soup and a sandwich. On day two we had the buffet breakfast in the restaurant, and dinner in the lounge - both times the food was non fussy and of a high standard.

All the staff we interacted with were very good, friendly without being obtrusive, obviously trained but without being mechanical.

I would stay here again when back in Dublin.",5,2017,10,26
211,Extremely convenient,"This is a great hotel for convenience. If you are just landing in Dublin airport, this is easy to drive to. The parking is simple and free, below the hotel. The staff is not overly friendly, but very competent. The lobby and public rooms are clean and light and open. The rooms are very comfortable and clean. The breakfast was buffet and open odering, and very adequate. If you are a sports fan, the arena is across the street. A cab to the city center is fast and not expensive, if you don't want to bother with taking a car in yourself. This hotel will hold on to your luggage if you get in early and need to store it till the rooms are ready. Nice easy place.",4,2017,10,25
211,Short stay,Rooms were clean and comfortable. The fish and chips at the sports bar were some of the best I have had. Not sure of surroundings as I did not venture out. The staff were very friendly and helpful. I would stay here if visiting Dublin and don't mind not being in city center.,5,2017,10,25
211,Great hotel about a 20 Euro taxi ride ride from the airport,Placed in this hotel because of delayed flights my Air Lingus. Very efficient staff and good food and service. Though not the type of high end quality hotel we used during overseas holidays I would very much recommend it.,5,2017,10,24
211,Fantastic hotel with fantastic service!,"Myself and my fiancé stayed here for one night (attending a concert at the 3 Arena) and we absolutely loved it here.

The staff were warm and welcoming at check in and there's even free parking (car park is situated underneath the hotel-very convenient! We were delighted to hear we had been upgraded to the Executive room on the fourth floor!! Our room (415) was really lovely and spotlessly keen although I felt for an 'executive' room it was a tad small-the bathroom was big but the bedroom area was small-however we didn't mind as it was spotless and as other reviewers have stated the beds and pillows were so comfortable.

We had a great nights sleep-so much so that we slept in til 11am and were mortified to discover we missed our breakfast! Rest assured though the staff were so accommodating and ensured we got a proper breakfast!! This did result in us checking out a little later (20 min) but thankfully the staff at reception were very understanding.

Will definitely be staying here for my next trip to Dublin-thanks so much Croke Park for a wonderful stay!",5,2017,10,24
211,Fine Hotel,"We arrived earlier than their check-in time but our room was ready.  Check-in process was efficient however, I believe they should offer universal adapters when they know you're not from their country.  The room was clean -- I didn't care for being right by the elevators but the room was set back a good ways so the noise was lessened -- and stocked well.  I prefer a refrigerator that's NOT a mini-bar but hey, at least they had one in the room (most in Ireland do not).  I also prefer my hair dryer to be in the bathroom but the only plug in their was for shavers only.  That's not just a Croke Park issue, it's all the hotels in Ireland.  Loved that they provided face cloths (washcloths) and conditioner because all the other hotels did not provide these items.  There was also air control which is, as we found, usually not offered in Ireland.  Their temps are moderate so perhaps they feel it's unnecessary; however, I do like to have the option to keep the room at MY desired temperature.  Breakfast buffet was full Irish breakfast and was a great start to our mornings even if it was a bit pricey.  All-in-All a fine hotel that we would stay in again if we're ever back in Dublin.",4,2017,10,24
211,Good stay,"Location was great for our event, which was across the street.  Hotel was nice, clean, good service, decent continental breakfast.  Bar was good, good service. the fitness room had everything needed to keep fit while on the road.  I recommend it. ",4,2017,10,23
211,Good place to overnight in Dublin,"Stayed here on a friday night hotel rooms in Dublin are damn expensive and the Croke Park is no exception.
The room and hotel is kept to a high standard.  Rooms might not be very big but more than adequate.  The bed was very comfortable.",4,2017,10,21
211,"Nice hotel, average room","Everything outside the room felt very nice and high end.  The staff were excellent, friendly, and helpful.  Inside the room it felt like your average, middle-tier hotel.  Everything was clean, but the bed was hard and felt cheap.  We enjoyed relaxing in the bar area and getting some food and drinks.  A good hotel overall, but if the bed was better it would be a great hotel.",4,2017,10,20
211,Great night - and a breakfast bag to go!,"We stayed here on the last night of our Ireland tour. After a very long day from Derry and Belfast, we arrived at the Croke Park.

Our room was large and quiet. We had a very early flight to the US in the morning. Since we would be leaving the
hotel before breakfast, they prepared us a nice bag with breakfast items. Very handy as we were hungry!

The staff was very pleasant and helpful.  Would definitely stay here again!",5,2017,10,19
211,Great Hotel to stay to start your Trip in Dublin,"wonderfully clean and spacious room. we Canadians loved the bathroom with the shower and tub, wife and I used both...right around the corner from little, community shops and variety store to stock up on food stuffs for our B&B travel adventure...parking garage was good for our rental car, and to see the stadium, across the street was a bonus for a ""out and about"" walking tour of the area when we got settled in our room.
staff was knowledgable and offered great ideas for sight seeing and shops to pick up items for our car trip...all within a reasonable walking distance for us; however, if you don't like to walk, then call a taxi or find out from staff where the bus routes are to downtown shopping .....when we are back over the pond again and in Dublin we'll stay here again...",4,2017,10,19
211,"Lovely hotel, but book taxis in advance","Lovely hotel, nice spacious rooms, decent (huge) bar, very nice breakfast and dinner options. Well suited for the city, but if you need to be somewhere early in the morning then be sure to book a taxi in advance the evening before as it can be a challenge to hail one, even if using an app. Not the hotels fault, just something to bear in mind.",5,2017,10,18
211,"Very pleasant, relaxing and well appointed Hotel","Highly recommended, easy to find, comfortable, good welcome and good food. I can't really fault it. At the same time it is still a standard hotel, very difficult for me to give five stars as I'm always looking for something just a little bit extra. I can certainly recommend it and I would certainly come again

",4,2017,10,17
211,Unforgettable journey,"Visiting Dublin is always a pleasure, but if you also stay in a so pleasant hotel, where everything goes so fine, the experience becomes unforgettable. Surely one of the most helpful staff I had never seen anywhere.",5,2017,10,17
211,Excellent Hotel,"It is super easy to get to this lovely hotel from the airport, plus it is in an excellent location to be able to walk downtown and other tourist hot spots.  The staff were friendly and helpful, the gym was large and well-equipped, and the Sideline Bar was a super spot to enjoy excellent food and warm but airy atmosphere.  The hotel room was spacious, even with a king size bed and I loved the fact that the bathroom had a walk in shower plus a bathtub!  Both concierges, Krishna and Stephen, were very knowledgeable in helping me to navigate around town.  ",5,2017,10,17
211,Here on advisement of Great Value Vacations,"The Croke Park is a very nice hotel.  It was the 5th and last hotel on our recent trip to Ireland which was arranged by Great Value Vacations.  We turned in our rental car when we got to Dublin so we decided to do the Hop on Hop off bus for 2 days  It was a little off the beaten path from ""where all the action is"" but only about a 10 minute walk or 10 Euro cab ride to O'Connell street.  Room was very clean and comfortable and breakfast which was included in our itinerary was very good.  The staff arranged for our taxi ride back to the airport as well and told us what the approximate time and cost would be.  I would recommend this hotel for those who don't want to be right downtown.",5,2017,10,14
211,"Nice hotel, good location for walking to downtown Dublin","First off, we requested and were very fortunate that we had early check in.  After a long plane ride, we were very pleased to be fortunate this could be accommodated. Our room was nice, no view, but comfortable, clean and quiet.  We had breakfast included in our room cost and it was excellent.  They have a full breakfast and make omelets to order.  We also had dinner there one evening and it was not only very good, but reasonably priced.  The walk to downtown Dublin including the Temple Bar area is up to two miles.  Our first full day there we walked a long way and took a taxi back who, we believe, took us for a ride for extra miles and cost so be aware.  As for the hotel, we recommend it.",4,2017,10,11
211,Great location for sports fans and convention-goers!,"I love the friendly staff at this hotel! While the ""view"" (central court offered a view of HVAC system) left a lot to be desired, it was right across the street from a conference I attended. Super clean, comfortable room and little amenities--plus breakfast included--made for a wonderful stay.",5,2017,10,11
211,Friendly hotel ideally located for both city and airport access,"This hotel is perfectly located for ease of access to the city centre and Dublin Airport. The city centre is within walking distance thru lovely georgian streets.  It is easy to find as you can spot the Croke Park stadium from streets away!  Parking under the hotel is convenient. Check-in when we visited was a dream.  Very Belgium and professional counter service.  The concierge was also very helpful.  Our room had a balcony with views directly up to the stadium, adjoining canal and railway track.  Perhaps as we were there in a Sunday, there was no train noise.  The room was very clean.  It had a very comfortable bed.  The super fast internet was very useful.  All staff encounters were friendly and professional.  The offer of a bottle of water for our onward journey when we checked out was a nice touch.  I'd certainly come back to this hotel if traveling thru Dublin in the future.",5,2017,10,10
211,Great Staff!,"We finished our Ireland holiday at The Croke Park and it couldn't have been nicer.

The rooms were fresh and clean, with very comfortable beds, and the facilities were kept impeccably.

We loved the breakfast buffet, and spent quite a few evenings in the Sideline bar for drinks and dessert. It's a great place to end the day. It's also a great place to hang and watch sports on the many, huge televisions!

From the front office, to the servers, to housekeeping, everyone was friendly and helpful whether we needed a taxi, sightseeing ideas, or a restaurant recommendation.

It was a terrific way to close out our trip to Ireland.",5,2017,10,08
211,great place to stay,"my friend and i recently stayed at the croke park hotel, and we were both very happy with our stay the staff  are friendly and accommodating. the room are spacious and very clean, the location is perfect no more than 10 euro taxi ride from hotel to city center, we really enjoyed our stay and hope to be coming back soon. ",5,2017,10,06
211,delux rooms not worth extra cost,Don't pay extra to stay in a delux room if your only reason is to use the executive lounge. The executive lounge is very poor and has no choices to eat. On the plus side the lounge is very clean and quiet . The hotel itself is also very clean.,3,2017,10,03
211,Ireland trip,We just returned from our trip in Ireland and stayed in The Croke Park for three days at the beginning of the trip. We loved the hotel and did not mind that it was not directly in the centre of town. The service of staff was exceptional. There was a championship match played in the stadium one day but the atmosphere in the hotel was a fun thing to experience. We had access to the executive breakfast suite on the fourth floor and that was a great start to our day. We will return to The Croke Park in the future.,5,2017,10,03
211,First Night in Ireland,The hotel was very conveniently located.  It was close enough to the main business area that it made it easy to go places without spending too much of our valuable time travelling.  Everyone there was eager to offer suggestions on where to eat and what to see and do in the city.  Parking was in there basement and complimentary.  Would stay there again if I return to Dublin.,4,2017,10,03
211,Great Experience,"Although not a luxury property, it is very nice--no real complaints.  Staff was professional, helpful and cordial.  Breakfast was included and it was delicious.  The room was very nice and everything was clean.  I would have liked  it to be a little closer to the city center than a 20-30 minute walk, but it was manageable.  It is an excellent value for the money!",4,2017,09,28
211,Perfect stay,"I booked the hotel for a couple of friends that recently got married to stay prior to their trip and they couldn't do more to make them happy. Reception/dinning/reservation, everything was PERFECT.
They stayed in the hotel suite which was an extra plus for their stay. ",5,2017,09,27
211,Luxury at a very nice cost,"The staff was so nice and helpful. The room was absolutely beautiful and super comfortable! The food in the bistro was delicious, especially the Mac and Cheese. One night my husband and I missed dinner and arrived super late to the hotel and they helped us order a pizza. I would definitely stay here again.",4,2017,09,25
211,Nice stay in Dublin,"Very nice hotel with all the amenities, Very helpful staff. They seem to take your request to heart and help as much as possible. Location outside of central Dublin, but just a short bus ride to central Dublin, only about 20 min drive to airport. 
Rooms were very nice, Five  minute walk to bus stop. Would recommend for your stay in Dublin.",5,2017,09,22
211,Has air conditioning!!! YEY,"I loved this hotel, the green colored hop on hop off bus stops right in front to take you in town!! I wanted to shout out to Anna at the desk, she was very pleasant and helpful :) We came in when the biggest match of the year was at the stadium across the street.. what a zoo, but I still had a great stay and was impressed with how they handled the crowd!  This is the closest pub/bar/hotel to the stadium and it was jammed! The bartenders are very good as well, the next day all was back to normal and it was great!  I cannot complain at all!",5,2017,09,21
211,Very Good,"Great modern hotel, right next door to Croke Park stadium.
Very pleasant staff, comfortable rooms, good wifi and free parking on site when you are staying as a guest and a great breakfast to boot. 
Highly recommend if you are attending a conference at Croke Park or near the city centre.",4,2017,09,21
211,Dublin Hotels,"This was a very nice hotel for the price. spacious clean and friendly staff. we were even able to check in early which was great because we had been flying all night
the only complaint and reason we would not stay again is that it was to far from the city center. we had to take a cab everywhere and there were few restaurants and or pubs nearby",4,2017,09,20
211,fabulous hotel,"Comfortable room, friendly staff, shuttle to the hop on hop off tour bus, fifteen minute walk to the town center. We went to the hotel earlier than our check in and they stored our luggage so we could get on the hop on hop off tour bus and they sold us the tickets. We were able to get our vacation started immediately. Would definitely stay again.",5,2017,09,20
211,Nice Hotel,"Stayed 2 nights All Ireland football weekend so it was pretty mental.Check in was fast and polite even with the crowd that were looking to check,obviously well used to such crowds.
Stayed in room 432 which was excellent, a fair sized room.Room service was excellent.
Restaurant was very good,we booked a table on Sunday night and the match special was excellent,a word of praise for one particular member of staff,Raj,polite,attentive and cheerful,helped us chose the wine,advised us on the meals,great to served by someone with a smile on there face.
Cons...were denied excess to executive area on Sunday as a corporate affair was on,shame on you,
Drinks can be pricey,mixers and beers included in this.
Prices for major weekends are exorbative.
All in all  an enjoyable stay despite the prices",4,2017,09,20
211,Very pleased,"was advised in advance of sporting event in Croke Park and steps to avoid match day traffic.

very friendly reception, free car parking, lovely bedroom & bathroom, great nights sleep as hotel very quiet.

when leaving reception gave us two complimentary bottles of water for the drive home, nice touch

thought staff were genuinely nice and happy in their job
",5,2017,09,18
211,Fantastic hotel for Croke Park events,"I was here for a conference that was held in Croke Park. It's great being across the venue, and very quiet. The space is modern with a great lounge area, seating for drinks across a large fireplace, etc. 

The breakfast is buffet style and good. 

The rooms are very quiet with nice bedding and spacious bathrooms. 

Great venue hotel!",5,2017,09,17
211,Good sized room,"This hotel is in the perfect location if you are going to an event at the stadium, it's a lengthy walk to Dublin city center. Rooms are good size but the tv worked terribly. I'm not sure if our air conditioning was working properly either. One minute our room was freezing the next minute it felt stuffy. Also room service was not the best either. ",3,2017,09,11
211,Wonderful!,"Awesome hotel on a quiet street and nice safe location. We were flying out at the Dublin airport the next day so was extremely convenient for us. Very comfortable, nice rooms and awesome  beds. Extremely helpful front desk staff and free parking was a plus. We definitely  would stay here again",5,2017,09,09
211,Over night stay in Croke Park Hotel.,"Spent a very pleasant over night stay in the Croke Park Hotel,from arrival to leaving we had a very enjoyable stay,all staff we encountered were very friendly, helpful and nice.our room was spotless and very large for a city hotel.we had a very enjoyable and delicious meal in the Sideline Bistro and look forward to a return visit very soon. As it was the night before the Hurling All Ireland Final the Hotel was very busy and there was a great atmosphere in it.",5,2017,09,07
211,Wish we had stayed here first!,"We booked our last night for our return to Dublin before our flight out the next day and boy, was I sorry that I did not book this place for the first two nights of our vacation as well! Brand new, beautifully decorated, spacious and clean rooms, helpful and cheerful staff, wonderful restaurant and spacious bar, within walking distance to the city centre and a short drive to the airport. We could not have been happier with the choice. PLUS, it was a super value -- one night was considerably less than we paid for a run down and worn townhouse hotel near St Stephen's Green. We will DEFINITELY stay here on our next trip to Dublin and I'll be recommending it to anyone I know who is travelling there.",5,2017,09,07
211,Super friendly staff! ,I went into the hotel to look for directions. One staff in particular was extremely helpful in helping me find where I needed to go even though I could tell he was busy with cleaning. He told me his name was Kevin. Super helpful guy! ,4,2017,09,06
211,Great Hotel,"Location great,if your going to a game in Croke Park. The staff we're very friendly and check-in was great. The bar is open and comfortable. Lots of space to relax and enjoy a drink except for game day.
The only day when their is security on the door and these men and very pushy and don't seem to care if you are a guest in the hotel or just in to use the bathroom, some training here would be time well spent.
Otherwise the room was top class.",5,2017,09,06
211,All Ireland hurling final 2017,"A perfectly located hotel for visiting Croke Park and a most enjoyable stay with comfortable clean room and great breakfast.
Very pleasant and helpful staff at check in and breakfast room.
Free car parking a great addition.
Will definitely stay in the future.
",5,2017,09,05
211,Fantastic hotel,"Great hotel to stay in. Staff were brilliant very friendly and helpful especially Krishna on the concierge desk. Good food in the bar, rooms spotless and very comfortable. loverly atmosphere about the hotel

Will definitely be back",5,2017,09,05
211,"Nice, corporate hotel","The hotel is a little bit outside of the city center, but there is parking, and walking into town only takes about 30 minutes.  My room was fine, if unexceptional.  The staff were very nice.  The full Irish breakfast is pricey at €16.",4,2017,09,04
211,"Superb hotel, in a superb location, in a superb city ...","Our stay from beginning to end at this hotel was marvellous. Travelling as a family with two young children (9 and 5) we found the reception, cleanliness and quality of welcome an absolute joy. Staff were fantastically helpful, polite and very professional.

Regarding location, we were able to walk into Dublin via Mountjoy Square Park, in under 20 minutes with our children. Another bonus.

The food at the hotel, whilst a little expensive, was of very high quality and certainly justified its price tag.

The room we had was of a really good size, and its cleanliness amongst the best I have seen on my extensive travels. Even though we were there on the night that Dublin won the GAA Senior All-Ireland Semi-Final against Tyrone in the stadium directly opposite (filling us with dread of loud noise and singing into the early hours) we actually found that the room we were allocated was not above the outdoor bar area and as such we heard NOTHING.

I would recommend this hotel to anyone and everyone that could be bothered to listen to me. We have no doubt whatsoever that we will be back again.

This is what hotels should ALL be like.",5,2017,09,03
211,Brilliant hotel,"Although placed more for sports fixtures this hotel is fantastic for those looking to spend time exploring Dublin. It is close to the city centre with great links and a shuttle bus for easy access to Dublin. The hotel itself is beautiful, clean with everything presented to a very high standard. The staff are great and did everything possible to make our stay lovely. We ate our meals here and found everything extremely good. We would highly recommend this hotel.",5,2017,09,03
211,GREAT HOTEL AND ATTENTIVE STAFF,"Very nice rooms.
Great restaurant.
Nice gym.
Good internet.
The concierges were great.
I got excellent walking directions to the city and the botanical gardens.
It's about a 25 min walk to the center of town, and there are buses nearby the hotel.
The stadium is across the street, so try to avoid being at the hotel when there is a large event, if you are looking for a quiet stay.",5,2017,09,02
211,Quick bite ,"We stopped for a quick feed after tour at the stadium. Warm welcome and food offering was 1st class. Staff especially were extremely attentive and accommodating. 

An excellent location that adds value to the GAA in the city. Place was buzzing. ",5,2017,09,01
211,Wonderful ,Croke park hotel! What can I say. As soon as you walk in the decor of the hotel is wonderful with a lovely modern and cosy style. You are handed a warm mini towel for your face when you walk in. The dining is wonderful with a wide choice of breakfast foods. The rooms are tidy and well cleaned with lovely views and there is a room for people in the 4th floor to have dinner and breakfast.,5,2017,08,30
211,Recent stay,"We recently stayed in Croke Park hotel after a GAA game. We arrived very early to get parked before roads closed. We informed staff of our arrival, the friendly & helpful staff checked us in & told us to come back in about 45mins. We then did & room was ready for us at 11am! I never have arrived at hotel never mind to a busy place this like on a very busy weekend of football. 
Staff so friendly, helpful & accommodating to anything that we needed. Will definitely be back here again.",5,2017,08,28
211,Great,"Recent trip with a group we stayed here and it couldn't have been nicer. Online the pictures looked so modern I wasn't expecting it to be elegant but it was. Comfortable beds, quiet rooms, great breakfast, lots of luxurious space in lobby areas to relax and friendly staff. Exactly what you need after a long day of sightseeing.",4,2017,08,28
211,Great place to stay in Dublin!,"We spent two nights at this hotel after a transatlantic flight from Atlanta, GA. I requested an early check in after our overnight flight and the hotel was able to accommodate that request. The room was lovely and well appointed. After a brief nap, we explored the neighborhood and found some nice restaurants in the area. We decided to dine in the hotel and the food was delicious. The waitstaff was slow and unlike a lot of waitstaff in the US, did not seem attentive enough for my taste. They do not depend on tips for a living and I supposed that was one of the reasons there seemed to be a lack of concern for the needs of our table. We had to get a staff member's attention and request everything we needed. No one came by the table to ask if we needed anything. We had to request our ticket, wait at least fifteen minutes for it (it was not very busy at the time) and after another fifteen minutes had to go to the bar to ask why we had not recieved our change. It is as if the bar/wait staff were operating on ""island time"" and had no concept that we might appreciate more attention.
The front desk personnel and the concierge were superb and extremely helpful. If I'm ever in Dublin again, I would consider staying here, but would dine elsewhere. There is a great Italian restaurant a few doors down with wonderful food and an attentive wait staff!",4,2017,08,28
211,Spacious clean rooms. Approx 20 minutes walk to the river,"Spent 3 nights at The Croke Park while visiting Dublin. I would easily recommend this as a place to stay if you don't mind a bit of a walk.
Location: The hotel is opposite Croke Park - home of Irish football. It is on the north side of the city meaning it is on the correct side for the airport. Taxis cost us 22 - 25 Euro. It is a good walk to the river with the tourist attractions on the south side but most of the shopping is on the north (hotel) side.
Food: We chose not to have breakfast so eat out for meals. The biggest draw back is that there are not that many good food places near the hotel - despite it being a tourist hotel and near the football stadium. Be prepared to walk up to 10 minutes to get food or else just eat in the city centre.
Rooms: The room was a triple and had plenty of space and the bathroom had separate bath and large shower.
The only downside to the hotel is that there is not more in the vicinity. So be prepared for long days and lots of walking. Major bus routes 5 - 10 minutes away help if you don't fancy the walk.",4,2017,08,28
211,❤,"The luxury hotel  located across the road from Croke Park Stadium, about 15  minutes drive away from Dublin Airport and 25 minutes walk from the National Botanic Gardens.  
The parking is free. Our room was nice and clean and connected with free Internet access.
The food was delicious.... we enjoyed the meals very much .  
The staff was helpful and kind. 
We had a great time.",5,2017,08,27
211,Luxurious Hotel offering great food!,"We stayed 2 nights and were impressed by the décor, cleanliness and spacious rooms.  We asked for a bucket of ice and it arrived immediately after I put down the phone!  Staff at reception and in restaurant were very friendly and efficient.
The food at the Croak Hotel is superb and delicious.  Their breakfast buffet was particularly tasty with numerous selections available. I ordered made-to-order omelettes both mornings and they were the largest and most delicious I have ever tasted!",5,2017,08,26
211,Exceedingly helpful,The Croke Park staff were very helpful in assisting us recover our lost luggage (Aer Lingus -awful).  They held our luggage while we were touring and when we returned 4 days later Croke Park had secured our bags from Aer Lingus.,5,2017,08,25
211,Excellent hotel on edge of Dublin,"We chose this hotel as we wanted somewhere convenient to stay after arriving from Holyhead on the ferry.  The hotel is of a very good standard. Friendly and efficient staff, pleasant rooms,  good food. Very convenient underground car park, free to guests, with lift link to reception and guest room floors.

Bit on the expensive side (especially the bar), but I suppose you get what you pay for.
",5,2017,08,25
211,Consistently outstanding service,"Excellent location for Croke Park. Also very convenient for the city and for the airport. 
Outstanding service on every visit.
Exceptionally good food - in particular the roast lamb!
Comfortable spacious rooms.
Easy parking.
Helpful competent staff - clearly an extremely well managed hotel.
",5,2017,08,25
211,Lovely Hotel right opposite Croke Park Stadium,"Loved the large room, huge bathroom and all the food was amazing. Presentation superb. I was impressed with their safety feature in the lifts (my room card had to be dipped to proceed up or down!) 
All the staff were pleasant and not over-friendly.  Stayed Four nights.",5,2017,08,24
211,Stay on vacation during soccer championships,"Happened to book without knowing there was a  if championship game in the stadium directly across the street. We planned on napping upon arrival at noon.
Hotel notifed is about street closures and accessibility which was great. 
Upon arrival found a busy and noisy lobby and surrounding area. This did not change the ability for us to rest during the game.
Staff was wonderful and helpful.  Very clean and highly recommend",5,2017,08,23
211,Nice Place,"Nice place to stay in Dublin, but nothing really sets it apart as special. The rooms are sort of small, but well appointed. The restaurants are ok... again nothing special. It is not in the City Centre which can be viewed as both a pro or a con depending on your needs. The hotel does not offer shuttle service to the City Centre or the airport, but there are services that work with the hotel to accommodate guests who wish to tour the city. In our case the location was a pro because we wanted to be close to the airport. We did appreciate the free parking and the staff was very friendly.",4,2017,08,21
211,Great hotel,I stayed 2 nights with my son. Our room was excellent... really comfy beds. The breakfast was delicious with a large variety of foods available. The staff were very helpful and we were able to leave our bags after we checked out whilst we went to a Gaelic football match (great fun). Highly recommended.,5,2017,08,20
211,Friendly and spotless.,"We stayed recently and were very happy with this hotel. It was great to have a separate shower and the bed was truly comfortable. Breakfast was lovely, as was our meal in the bistro. Staff we encountered couldn't do enough to help. It takes about 30 minutes to walk in to town but that didn't bother us at all.",5,2017,08,20
211,very comfortable,"Our first night in Ireland and first Irish hotel. Well we weren't dissappointed. The hotel was great and the staff was too.  The rooms were clean ,neat and comfortable . 
   We ate in the hotel and the food was delicious. Again killing the rumor that Irish food was just OK. Since this was our second meal in Dublin, we figured there were no worries  from here on out.
  Since our day had started about 7AM  eastern time, we were all bushed so after a few Guinness's we all headed to bed. Maybe the best part of the day. The beds were very comfortable and the pillows were to die for. Slept like a baby , ready for Ireland
   Thanks staff for taking such good care of us.",5,2017,08,18
211,Love this hotel- the most comfortable bed I've slept in!,"My husband and I are traveling around Ireland and have stayed at this hotel for 5 wonderful nights. From the moment we arrived the staff were friendly and helpful, nothing is too much trouble. 

As stated in the title the bed is amazing! We had a big room with all the things you would expect (tea/coffee/tv etc), but we also had complementary access to the executive lounge (for guests staying for 5 days or more). It was great, a good selection for continental breakfast each morning, and 24hr access to Orange/Apple juice, water tea/coffee and Fruit.

The hotel is outside of the town centre directly opposite the stadium. It costs about €10-15 each way in a taxi to go into the town centre, however if you are doing the hop on/hop off bus tour then the green buss will pick up from outside the hotel every 30 mins until 10:30. The car park is below the hotel, well lit and felt happy leaving the car there (it's also free to guests).

This has been a great start to our holiday, can't fault it!",5,2017,08,18
211,"Expensive, comfy beds, Ok breakfast, far from city, horrible TV in the room.","This hotel is alright. Posh and renovated, or perhaps news. Clean carpets, bathrooms have nice clean white lines. Staff are very helpful. 

But the I hated the television in the room, hence they lost a star. It had no HDMI or USB connection that I could plug my stuff into. And the Tv was very small for the room. The room was decent size and so was the bathroom. Nice blackout curtains too.  

I paid for breakfast on one day. It wasn't the best breakfast I had. I had to order my toast and coffee which took ages to come. I normally judge a breakfast by the quality of the sausages. They weren't that decent here. 

Despite my negative comments, my rating for this hotel is a 4/5. I've been around the world enough time to know the difference between a good and a bad hotel.",4,2017,08,18
211,If you're not afraid to walk a little bit ...,"The Croke Park hotel may be situated a bit further than most others but it offers superb accommodation, comfort and parking facilities. While remaining within reasonable walking distance from the city centre.  The rooms are well insulated (soundproof) and the beds were very comfortable. We also appreciated the quality of the service and staff attention. ",5,2017,08,18
211,"Lovel hotel, but be prepared for a walk!","We liked the hotel: clean, comfortable and friendly staff. But we did not have a car, and it is fairly remote from sites and restaurants. 25 minutes walk to city center. The room was very nice, but a bit warm. With the window open the room was noisy. And there was a lot of hallway noise during the night. Staff was excellent.",4,2017,08,18
211,Service above & beyond,"We stayed here enroute to airport (very early morning) & our daughter stayed on for a match in Croke Park as she suffers from Crohns disease and is recovering from major surgery. We explained this at check in and she was given a late check out so she could rest up until match time. 
On check out the hotel was extremely busy as is usual on match days. I'm sorry I don't know the name of the employee but he took her to the hotel gym which was the only quiet spot in the hotel so she could sit down until she had to leave for the start of the main game! This I believe was exceptional service. Thank you so very much!
We stay here a couple of times a year...before matches & have always been extremely satisfied with service & cleanliness..can't recommend highly enough! Thank you. 😀",5,2017,08,16
211,A very pleasant stay.,"My Family and I stayed at the Croke Park hotel on August 12th,we really enjoyed our stay,staff were very courteous and helpful to us.We eat in the sideline bar food was excellent a great selection of different meals.it was a bit pricey but I suppose being match weekend this was to be expected.but a very good stay overall.",5,2017,08,16
211,Lovely hotel with helpful staff,"We stayed at the Croke Park for two nights at the beginning of our Irish road trip.  The room was lovely, spacious and clean, and the staff were exceedingly helpful--a special thanks to Krishna and Stephen at concierge for helping us sort the shipment of our forgotten laptop!!  Breakfast was copious and delicious, great value for money (although our dinner in the bar was a bit of a disappointment).  It was a 13 euro/10-minute taxi ride into the city centre, which suited us fine as we only had one full day in Dublin and wanted to make the most of it without going back and forth to the hotel.  Would definitely stay here again and would recommend it to other travellers!",4,2017,08,15
211,Overnight stay for match in croke park ,"Absolutely brilliant hotel.  The hotel was very busy as it was semi final day at croke park however that didn't flutter the hotel staff...from the moment we arrived the service was excellent..as our room wasn't ready because we were early..the check-in receptionist told us we cud use the executive lounge on the 4th floor as our room was on the 4th floor.  We received complimentary voucher for an alcohol beverage and there where loads of extras free in the lounge.

Our room was very clean and comfortable.  We will definitely make a return trip and stay longer next time...brilliant fast service at check in and departure..lovely friendly staff and the little extras and thoughtfulness really make the stay....thanks croke park hotel",5,2017,08,15
211,Great service,Our party was really well looked after by all the staff.  Nothing was a problem.  The breakfast was very nice as well.  We took the time to do the Croke Park Stadium Tour and the staff were very helpful by arranging this for us.,5,2017,08,13
211,dublin week end,"Great hotel, friendly staff, very obliging, comfortable spacious family rooms for.children walking distance to  city centre shopping areas and  theatre  and very clean.  and of course the free parking for guests was wonderful considering Dublin parking prices Hopefully will be back soon",4,2017,08,10
211,FANTASTIC ONE NIGHT STAY!,On arrival to Croke Park Hotel we were greeted with a very welcoming smile. Our check in was quick and efficient and the porter took our luggage straight away and offered to help us.  Our room was facing the stadium (305) which we had asked for and had we also got two complimentary bottles of moet.  What a beautiful treat! The staff advised us of a lovely restaurant just up the street called Wallaces and we booked it for dinner.  Breakfast the next morning was fantastic with loads of choices in very relaxed atmosphere. We could not get booked in the second night as it was totally booked up but the reception staff tried their best each hour to check for cancellations.  We had dinner in the restaurant on the Sunday and it was perfect.  We will certainly be back at this hotel! 5 stars all round!,5,2017,08,09
211,Brilliant Hotel,"Hotel was beautiful, clean comfortable and great value for money. The best thing about this hotel is the staff, they couldn't do enough for us during our stay. The hotel was very busy the day we booked in but that did not phase the staff. They made conversation and had a smile everyone. Food was delicious and staff we happy to fulfill any requests we had. Highly recommend this hotel for a stay in Dublin.",5,2017,08,09
211,cracker beyond croker,"From arrival to departure, the family had a great stay in the Croke Park Hotel, aided by the view of thee Croke Park for all fans of stay & play. 
Free car parking was a bonus, while bedrooms were comfortable & bar areas equally good.",5,2017,08,09
211,Surprisingly quiet,"Being across the street from an arena, it's normal to expect a lot of loud noise, causing lack of sleep.  Although there was a huge tournament in town the room was surprisingly quiet, clean, good water pressure, great breakfast, and very friendly staff.  The only problem I had was my room wasn't ready upon arrival but other than that I would recommend this hotel to families, business travelers, or anyone just passing through.  It's in a central location and walking distance to shopping and dining.",4,2017,08,08
211,Very pleased with our stay,"We stayed to nights at the Croke Park hotel via a recommendation from a neighbor.
As we were attending Croke Park stadium for our first time and as the name might relay 
 the    hotel was ideally situated .The rooms were of a good size ,good wifi ,we only used the restaurant once for our dinner and we were pleased with our meals
Staff could not have been more friendly ,and only 10 mins walk to the city center.",5,2017,08,08
211,Weekend away,"Arrived on Sunday 6th August. Hotel was buzzing with Gaelic fans.  But Hotel staff were so welcoming and friendly . The rooms were spotless . Beds very comfortable. We ate in restaurants both nights very reasonably priced meal was absolutely gorgeous as was breakfast both mornings. For such a busy weekend in the hotel it was kept immaculately clean. It's about a 15 min walk away from city centre. On site parking is brilliant .
Will definitely be making a return visit .",5,2017,08,08
211,Odyssey,"Peter, Orla and their staff were the best I have ever dealt with.  I have stayed at 100's of hotels around the world and they were the best My wife and I have encountered. The way this management group was involved in all aspects of the operation made for a remarkable experience.
",5,2017,08,07
211,Will definitely return!,"We loved our stay here. Great price,staff excellent with the kids. Lovely room, delicious bar food and kids menu. Very peaceful despite it being full as u2 were playing the next night! Weren't able to stay for breakfast as we were booked on the first ferry but we'll definitely come back. ",5,2017,08,07
211,Excellent business hotel,"I was in Dublin for a business trip. The Croke Park was convenient as it was just across from the conference center. Although it’s a long hike into the center of Dublin, for a business trip, this hotel is simply perfect.

A great bar and restaurant, superb service, comfortable beds, and convenient amenities. And fast, reliable WiFi. All in all, a very positive experience.",5,2017,08,07
211,Pleasantly surprised,"I was down for a Match and I was taken back by how well the staff here treated us , Nothing was a problem and all our needs were dealt with in a nice mannerly and helpful way , 
Rooms were spotless clean , food was excellent , staff brilliant 
what more could a guest ask for 
Thank you Croke park and my family look forward to staying with you again ",5,2017,08,07
211,"Nice hotel, adjacent to Croke Park stadium","We enjoyed our stay. The room was very large by European standards (typical 'American' size). About a mile from the city center. It's 'walkable' if you're up for it or you can take a bus or a taxi. Very busy on game weekends, but it didn't hinder our 'tourist' agenda. ",4,2017,08,05
211,A great stay,This hotel is in a really convenient location to the airport and downtown.  The restaurant and pub area served really good meals that were enjoyed by all. The halls and common areas are clean and updated.  The room was very nicely equipped and clean.  A definite stay.  ,5,2017,08,02
211,"Nice rooms, location not central ","This is a lovely hotel. Definitely the nicest one we stayed at during our tour de ireland. The rooms are nice and updated and the bathrooms were very spacious. I would say quality would be on par with a courtyard, which is pretty good for a European hotel. Our room was on floor 1 (which is actually the second floor) but it was very quiet, even the night after a big match at croke park.

The one thing I didn't love was the location  (trade off). It was a solid 30 minute walk from downtown. We timed it one night, took 35 to 40 minutes to walk from Christ church. There's not much around the hotel. Bleecker st cafe is a 10 minute walk away for a nice breakfast or coffee. Some of the hop on hop off busses drop at croke park and  can bring you downtown but the line that runs there only comes every 30 min or so. A can from temple bar costs 10 to 12 euros. Not a bad trade off for a quiet hotel. ",4,2017,08,02
211,"A good hotel, competitively priced","Seems reasonably new but has an established charm about it. Directly opposite Croke Park it might be wise to check if any major events are scheduled before booking here. It's also a 20 minute walk to the more ""touristy"" areas of Dublin and the restaurant precinct. He rooms a good size, they were quiet and there is also free parking and wifi.

The beds were comfortable, but the saggy pillows were a disappointment. The bathroom was huge with a long, deep soaking bath. Greta after all that walking. Those not from Ireland/UK need to be aware of safety latches on some hot water taps. Our showers were cool to cold and we couldn't work out why, especially as we could have scorchingly hot baths!

Hotel staff were efficient and friendly, with the exception of those we encountered at the cafe/bar. A latte seemed to take forever.

As an indication, the Croke Park is similar in both style and price to a mid tier Accor properties such as Novotel, but it has a little more character. I'd stay here again if returning to Dublin.",4,2017,08,01
211,Croke park hotel,"Nice place to stay.  Again no air conditioning. We had a very nice room along side the canal. This hotel is just across from the stadium. We were told that this a very safe area, but the women on our tour wasn't to sure of this. The hotel is very modern and has everything that you would need.",4,2017,08,01
211,Beautiful,"This is a busy hotel because it is across the street from the stadium by the same name. The hotel offers family and individual packages to stay during the sporting season.
Very nice hotel with several areas for extremely comfortable seating.. Big screen TV in the bar area, The breakfast we had was very good with the buffet replenished as needed. Would definitely stay here again.",4,2017,08,01
211,5 STAR - ALL THE WAY,"The Croke Park Hotel undoubtedly would merit a 5 star award. The hotel oozes hospitality coupled with excellent quality in all areas, including bedrooms, restaurant and bar facilities as well as free car-parking, which most certainly is very rare in Dublin!  From the moment that guests step into the spacious lobby, they are cordially greeted with a warm friendly smile from each and every one of the receptionists, including the concierge staff.  We have been guests in the hotel on numerous occasions and thanks to all the staff, we have enjoyed many happy stays over the years. Each time we arrive, we are amazed how every member of staff can call us by name in such a friendly manner.  Mr Sean Reid, Deputy General Manager ensures that he is always on hand to meet and greet all his guests with such warm hospitality. Even though he is such a busy gentleman in every area of the hotel, he always finds the time to have a cosy chat with the hotel guests, especially on match days. Sean is a true Dub supporter, but it must be said that he is to be admired for the greatest respect that he has for every other county teams' supporters. His friendly banter with guests from all parts of the world certainly make everyone's stay a truly delightful experience.  With Sean we always find ourselves so warmly welcomed in opulent surroundings with such impeccable service, and an incredibly luxurious stunning ambience. No request, large or small, is ever too much for Sean and the ever efficient staff in each of their own departments, unfailingly deliver quality customer service that exceeds all guests' expectations.

The bedrooms are very spacious with double or super king-sized beds, with large luxurious bathrooms. They are tastefully decorated to include mini-bar, and safe, not to mention bathrobes and slippers. Soft duvets and pillows are a real treat for a brilliant night's rest.  

Breakfast is a wonderful relaxing affair in the Sideline Bistro, again with staff who have been highly trained in their own particular role in the restaurant.   Food is divine with an extensive buffet menu.  The traditional brown bread is delicious as well as the wide selection of fresh fruit and cereals, coupled with hot breakfast items.  Tea/coffee is brought to the table with fresh toast as often as one desires.  The dinner menu is a culinary delight with a wide choice to suit everyone's taste.

The Executive lounge on the 4th floor adds such tranquility to one's stay.  Complimentary newspapers, tea/coffee, soft drinks and fresh fruit are continually replenished to ensure that all guests on this floor truly enjoy the benefits of the 'Executive Rooms'.  The additional extras as well as the comfortable armchairs and large screen television are a real treat.

The entire staff, who are great ambassadors for the hotel, compliment their exquisite surroundings and the overwhelming experience is certainly one of 5 star luxury. Superpower free wifi adds to the overall classy experience where the whole ambience lends itself to a brilliant relaxing break. 

Well done once again to all the Staff in the Croke Park hotel.  Pure luxury at its best!",5,2017,07,31
211,Excellent customer service,"Staying here at the moment, on a busy match day. Staff in restaurant and lady seating restaurant guests could not be more helpful to us, a family with young children. I hope management appreciates them. Other restaurants and hotels in Dublin should learn to train their staff in a similar way. I would definitely recommend this hotel to families with young children. Their Zoo package is also very good value. ",5,2017,07,30
211,excellent,"The hotel is just out of Dublin's downtown, a 10 (at most 15) minutes walk away from it. This is no bad thing, since the downtown is very noisy, crowded and, history apart, not really 'incredibly stunning'. The hotel in contrast is excellent on all fronts - friendly and professional staff, absolutely clean and quiet, lovely food for breakfast and dinner. We highly recommend it.",5,2017,07,30
211,Best Hotel,Title says it all best hotel out there value for money and staff  are so good.Big family rooms.Food very good.Kids made so welcome here  and nice location for visiting city .Toilets always clean and tidy.Bar staff and serving staff always give 100%.,5,2017,07,29
211,Enjoyed The Croke Park ,"Family of three visiting Dublin for the first time enjoyed our stay at The Croke Park. Positives included the clean and quiet room, huge bathtub and bathroom. We had double beds for a 6 year old and two adults. Superior x 2 Doubles. Front desk staff very helpful and the free parking in a city that charges everywhere for parking was great. We found however this location was not so close to too many food options. We made a few walks of over 20 minute for dinner (deduct time if you have no children and walk at a far pace). Also proximity to city sights not so close as other hotels but again we felt the quietness and free parking out weighed this. Feet are good for walking. We did not eat at the hotel. ",4,2017,07,29
211,Clean and comfortable,"This is an ideal place to stay . Very clean, friendly staff ,little extras and attention to detail  leave this hotel high on our must return list. Though close to the  city ,the noise level is low, although there was nothing in the stadium the night we stayed. Free secure car  parking for guests is another bonus.Dublin hotel prices are rising and this hotel is competitive in its rates.Will call again....",4,2017,07,29
211,Very handy for Croke Park events,"We were in town for U2 so rooms all over were at a premium - and charged at a premium. We were lucky to get the only remaining room at the Croke Park Hotel and, given everywhere was expensive, were please to fnd that our room gave us access to the executive lounge 24/7, with free snacks, fruit, soft drinks, tea and coffee available. It also meant we had a 'private' bar before and after the gig. The room was comfortable, the mattress wonderful and all the staff unfailingly charming. The TV was rather small and the room wasn't soundproofed so we could hear the noise from the courtyard bar below us. Other than that our only criticism is that the hotel decor and furnishings look rather tired. All in all it was a great stay, but the hotel could probably do with a little refurbishment,",4,2017,07,29
211,"Clean, comfortable, great breakfast","Here's what we really liked about the hotel: the room was comfortable, the bed and pillows were comfortable, the bathroom was clean, and the toiletries (The White House) were quality.  The Reception staff, whilst not warmly welcoming, ensured we had the information we needed. They ordered our taxis on time.  The breakfast was excellent.  I love a hotel that provides great breakfasts and include cappuccino-style coffees in the cost (rather than an extra).  I love a breakfast that provides loads of fresh fruit, yogurt, seeds, nuts and crunchy granola.  My husband went for the cooked bacon, eggs, tomato and toast option and he was very happy with the options.  The downside for us was that the hotel is not near the Dublin attractions we wanted to see: Kilmainham Gaol, The Book of Kells, Christ Church Cathedral, Temple Bar etc.  We needed a taxi to and from these, each time around a cost of 10-12 Euros. But thinking about that, if we stayed at a hotel where we could walk to these attractions, we would have missed all of the lovely and informative chats we had with the Dublin taxi drivers.  All (but one, who wasn't a 'local') of the taxi drivers where friendly and really up for a chat and happy to explain more about the city and about Ireland's history.  So, when considering your hotel options, factor the taxi rides into the cost of the hotel room.  The Croke Park is a comfortable hotel to stay in, plus you get the bonus of the local flavour in your taxi rides.",4,2017,07,28
211,What a pleasant surprise.,"The bar is well stocked, the restaurant is excellent especially the seafood chowder, and the smoked haddock and cod patties for starters, were the best I had in all of Ireland.You need to mention how you like your fish cooked, as they will bring it out well done, I like mine a little rare in the middle. The breakfast was abundant. the ambiance in bar is excellent.There is also a Club Lounge with tea, coffee, and fruit, and continental breakfast on offer with some room types, however we chose to eat in the large dining area. Well worth the extra to be paid. The room is spacious, and very reasonably priced. When i booked I was not aware that U2 were going to play across the road, hence the hotel was booked out on one of the nights that we wanted to stay. Will definately stay at Croke Park Hotel. Loved it!!!!",5,2017,07,26
211,What an amazing hotel!,"We just stayed the 1 night as a short city break and I chose this hotel from the reviews and the proximity to the city! 

It's about 15 min walk from O'Connell st and 20 mins from temple bar but it's far enough outside of the busy centre that it's so quiet!! 

The hotel itself is fantastic. Very modern, super clean, staff were some of the best I've had at a hotel and the room was very spacious, tidy and not a defect in sight!

When we return to Dublin we will be staying at this hotel again no question! Both me and my wife both agreed it's more of a 5 star than a 4! 

Great work guys!!",5,2017,07,25
211,Amazing Hotel,Chose the hotel due to its proximity to the Croke Park Stadium where I was attending a concert. It's ideal for that purpose but would say if you want to stay away from the noise of the city centre this would be ideal as it's still within a 15 minute walk to the centre. All the staff we encountered where highly professional but friendly and welcoming. Bed was amazing and I had a pleasant sleep with is rare for me.,5,2017,07,24
211,Directly across the road from the famous Croke Park Stadium,We stayed in The Croke Park Hotel for the Coldplay concert which was taking place directly across the road from the hotel. Check-in was seamless and hassle free on a busy day and the room itself was clean & spacious. However the bar/restaurant area were packed  as is understandable on such a busy occasion but there was no separate residents bar.... that afternoon we had to take a taxi into the city centre to get lunch/dinner and in the evening we had to leave the bar area and order room service so that we had somewhere to sit down and have our food & drinks. It seemed like the hotel was keen to capitalise on the concertgoers but forgot about the guests who were staying in the hotel that night/weekend. I would stay there again but maybe not when events are taking place in the stadium,4,2017,07,23
211,Outstanding Hotel,"Modern, comfortable, great room, great breakfast. Located within walking distance to all Dublin attractions and great restaurants. Close to airport. Service outstanding. Will stay here again on our next visit to Ireland.",5,2017,07,23
211,The experience exceeded my expectations,"My stay at the hotel we truly amazing. I felt very special and that the hotel cared about me personally. The hotel was clean, food delicious, staff incredibly helpful, nice, sweet and respectful. I felt better then home :)",5,2017,07,23
211,BEST hotel during our trip,"We chose to stay at Croke Park Hotel during our 2 week honeymoon in Europe. It was the BEST hotel we stayed out out of all of the hotels!

This is a hidden gem that deserves a HUGE spotlight!!!

The hotel is literally right in front of the Croke Park (which is an 84,000 seat stadium where they play Gaelic football). We booked our stay almost a year in advance and lucky for us, the Gaelic championship was going on so we had the chance to meet with locals and travelers and get to know them. It was an unexpected and awesome experience. It is very close to City Center (about 10-15 minute walk) and very close to other places (pubs, restaurants, tour bus, banks, etc.). 

The rooms (and hotel itself) was lovely! Super clean, very spacious (even the bathroom was spacious!), better than average furniture and actually, an unusually comfortable bed with extremely nice pillows. They had great amenities and more than just the basics.

We had a lovely breakfast (all kinds of pastries, breads, jams, cold cuts, cheeses, fresh fruits, different kinds of coffee, yogurt and unlimited toppings (like granola, dried fruit, nuts), packaged granola bars/cookies) and as a traveler, I greatly appreciated the FREE BOTTLED WATER. It was really thoughtful of the company and hotel to provide this to guests. That alone was amazing. 

The staff was EXCELLENT. When I think of customer service"", the ladies and gents from Croke Park were the prime examples and have set the bar very high for other hotel staff.

If we ever return, I am definitely staying here and I HIGHLY recommend that others stay here also. You won't be disappointed.

P.S. Free wifi with great speed!",5,2017,07,20
211,Staying at the Croke,"We found the Croke to be a very pleasent Hotel for staying a few days in Dublin. We stayed there with our daughter and it was one of the very few Hotels that offered a Family room for the three of us. The breakfast was great and we enjoyed the well equipped Fitness room every morning. We also appreciated the very knowledgeable concierge, who helped us organize our tours in Dublin. It is located a bit outside of the City center, but it only takes you a 15 minutes walk to get there.",5,2017,07,20
211,Directly across from the Hurling and Football Statium,Great place to stay in the city- near restaurants and college. Room was very well appointed with modern conveniences. Impressive. Beds were very comfortable; in building restaurant was very good; parking was complimentary ( unusual in the city); easy access to the airport.,5,2017,07,20
211,"Staying at the Croke Park Hotel, Dublin","I would highly recommend it. It's like a luxurious home from home. Staff are really friendly and nothing is too much trouble. Food is lovely. Rooms are great. Location is super. It's a good, central place for friends to gather from many locations.",5,2017,07,20
211,Excellent Hotel,My husband and I recently stayed in this hotel. We were in an executive room for 2 nights. Used this hotel as a base to do some sightseeing.Room was very clean and beautiful. Bed was extremely comfortable. Food in the bar and in the restaurant was lovely. Staff all very friendly and courteous. Hotel very clean. Have stayed here before and will definitely return.,5,2017,07,20
211,"Pleasant, clean and comfortable",We spent two nights at Croke Park and we were very satisfied with our stay. We came about our reservations via a travel agency but they were experienced and knew first-hand about this particular hotel. We had a great stay with no issues whatsoever. ,5,2017,07,20
211,Party of four going for a two night stay.," We experienced an exceptional high standard of customer care.  The rooms were clean and have good quality furniture, beds, mattresses and on suit facilities.  Although the four of us were only staying for a concert we were attending, we felt that the hotel worked well for both short brakes and business functions. ",5,2017,07,19
211,Excellent,"We had an executive room and couldn't fault it.  Check in was seamless and the staff were wonderful.  Unfortunately we only had one night.  We would have loved more.  The staff in the bar and in the restaurant were also excellent and the choices on the menu for dinner were very good.  Our room was lovely, clean and fresh, with a very comfortable bed.  We would definitely recommend The Croke Park.",5,2017,07,18
211,Very comfortable but some distance from downtown,"Took bus from airport to about 4 blocks from hotel.  HOtel very nice, very modern and comfortable. Some distance from the downtown commercial area however so wound up using taxis to get around. Got a two day on-off bus pass which was very helpful in seeing the sights.",4,2017,07,18
211,Excellent Stay,Beautiful hotel with friendly and welcoming staff! The breakfast was above and beyond what we expected and we left in the morning with our bellies full to the brim! Loved this place and will most definitely be returning! Thank you from the bottom of our hearts!! ,5,2017,07,18
211,Outstanding Service and Comfort,"The Croke Park Hotel is outside of the city center of Dublin -- it is about a 20-25 minute walk to attractions in the city.  The neighborhood is a mix of residential and small businesses (e.g., auto repair, plumbing), and it felt safe during the day and early evening, so we walked to and from the hotel each day.  As far as the hotel itself, the rooms were very comfortable (and have air conditioning), the staff was exemplary, and the food on the breakfast buffet was above average.  The hotel does appear to cater to tour groups; there was a tour bus in front of the hotel each night we stayed, but there was never any delay at breakfast or at the front desk in spite of this.  All in all, I was extremely pleased with my stay at the Croke Park Hotel.",5,2017,07,16
211,Surprised this is #3 in all of Dublin,"To be honest, I am really surprised this is ranked third out of all the hotels in Dublin. The neighborhood isn't that nice although it is close to things like Croke Park and O'Connell St. The façade and especially the interior hallways need updating. Everything seems a bit run down and a little shabby. The room was better although the carpet seems worn. The bathroom was nice and clean. Staff are professional. In fairness, the rates are cheaper so perhaps that has something to do with the ranking.",3,2017,07,16
211,one night,We did a self-drive tour and stayed at a hotel in Dublin the first and last nights.  This hotel was by far better than our other experience in Dublin.  We would definitely stay here again at the front end of tail end of our Ireland excursion.,4,2017,07,16
211,Great hotel & location,"We wanted a hotel close enough to Dublin to explore and to easily get back to the ferry as we only had 1 night here, this hotel was perfect! Rooms are very modern and roomy, the White Company toiletries are a nice touch. We didn't eat here but had a drink in the bar in the evening, the service was quick and the staff very helpful. Would recommend a stay here and would definitely return.",5,2017,07,16
211,Comfortable stay,"Stayed here for a week whilst working in Dublin. It's about 10 mins taxi ride from the city centre, so usually a little cheaper than the large central hotels, unless there is a big concert or Gaelic football match on at the Croke Park Stadium opposite, when they get very busy. 

Reasonable cooked breakfast buffet, helpful service, comfortable room, spacious bar. Not much around in the immediate vicinity so you need to get a taxi if you want to get out for a drink or dinner.",4,2017,07,15
211,Very good,"Very good rooms with good size bed and great shower, very professional and welcoming staff. We he'd a dinner in the restaurant and food was excellent with very good choices on the menu. Rooms are very quiet so you can get good night of sleep, did not try breakfast as we left very early but definitely will stay again.",5,2017,07,13
211,Excellent Overnight Stay,"Last week I stayed in the Croke Park Hotel.  From arrival to departure everything was done without fuss.  Small issue with noisy A/C was immediately addressed by a room change.  Special thanks to Sandeep and Krischna and the front desk (Sophia) for their help during my stay.  The executive lounge was fantastic and has all you need for a continental breakfast.  I basically nested there for the day as I had returned from a long haul flight. The coffee machine is a little tempermental and may need a service as it was giving trouble regularly.
I stayed in the Sam Maguire suite for one night as it was a special occasion.  Again Krischna and the front desk were very helpful here.  The bed was extremely comfortable and the toiletries (White & Company) were excellent quality.  It was nice to have the space and also the stadium view which is impressive.  From this close proximity to the Croke Park stadium one can only imagine the view immediately outside the Colosseum in Rome when the Roman empire was at its height (see Gladiator for nearest modern interpretation).  Also on Saturday morning we culd hear the soundchecks from Coldplay which was cool.
Went for dinner in the Sideline bar and service was a little slow (as was room service), so these are small things to correct.  I walked into the gym and it looked adequate and smelled fresh so it is being kept clean.
The only thing missing to make this a ""must stay"" as a family hotel is a swimming pool.  Even a 15m swimming pool would suffice, like in London city centre hotels.
Underground secure parking is brilliant.  Definitely an option for an overnight stay for the Cork hurling matches later in the year.  Hon the Rebels!!!!
Close proximity to the city centre either by car or walking means this hotel is on my radar for future trips.  There are also discounts to the Croke Park Museum, Tour and Sky walk when staying in the hotel so overall a big thumbs up!",4,2017,07,13
211,"Great service, great location","This hotel is located across the street from Croke Park, a hurling venue and one of the largest stadiums in Europe. We stayed over a championship weekend, and the area was very busy, but it was great to get a taste of what game day is like in Dublin, and the rooms were clean, quiet, and comfortable. There's free parking under the hotel and the service is truly wonderful — friendly, accommodating, and competent. 5/5",5,2017,07,12
211,On croak Park doorstep,"A lovely hotel right opposite croak Stadium, so handy if you like sport. Also a good time to visit Stadium to look around. 
Hotel is clean, rooms are spacious and the bathrooms good. Food is OK, but menu never changes, so limited choice. Breakfast is excellent.
Quite a way out of Dublin which means you need transport in and out, and this means you are a captive client unless you travel out to eat.  Drinks are expensive as well.
Lovely open fire in bar area and a quiet library room.",3,2017,07,11
211,Cold play concert,"As a family we stayed for one night in the Croke park hotel as my wife and daughter were attending a Cold play concert. I must the staff were amazing. Despite the hotel being crowded with concert goers all staff members were obliging, courteous, helpful and professional at all times.
The room was perfect with a view of the stadium and spotless.
The room had all the amenities that you would require.
I would definitely recommend it.",5,2017,07,11
211,Excellent hotel in front of the stadium,"Excellent hotel (this was my second stay at the Croke Park Hotel), ideal location if you have tickets for an event at the Croke Park stadium (literally on the other side of the road) and just a 10 min. walk from O'Connell street; I booked a twin room and it was wide, clean and comfortable (so was the bathroom, with both bathtub and shower-box). Staff very friendly and helpful. Very good breakfast, large choice of food for the ""irish"" breakfast, maybe the choice could be increased a little bit for the ""continental"" one.
Overall, an excellent hotel which I'll surely recommend and where I'll surely return.",5,2017,07,11
211,short break,"The Croke Park is opposite the Croke Park Arena. The receptionist was very polite and helpful, we arrived early and our room was not ready, we were offered an other room if we did not wish to wait. We said e would wait and went to the bar where we had lunch and the only complaint we had was the cheese and ham toastie. the cheese was almost non existent, otherwise the hotel, the room and the Bistro, where they served breakfast and evening meals was was spot on. The staff were all veronica and helpful. I will advise any hotel guest to check the mini fridge, which should be stocked with drinks and snacks. This is connected to their computer, if you take something out it is meant to show up on it. They put a bottle of wine on our bill, but we never had anything out of the fridge and i had checked contents on arrival so new no wine in fridge. We pointed this out to them and they removed it from the bill. The Hotel is within walking distance of the city and will take you about 30 minutes to walk, each way. We did not use any transport whilst in Dublin apart from the air bus to and from the airport. Croke park is the 700 bus from airport and first stop. Then you have to walk a short distance. Any airbus back from under railway bridge which is out side railway station, to the airport.",5,2017,07,10
211,First visit to Dublin,"We were staying at this hotel as we were attending the Coldplay concert opposite. This hotel was ideal and all the staff were very friendly and helpful throughout our stay. Our room was lovely.. clean and well appointed. We ate in the Bistro one evening and thoroughly enjoyed our meal!! We will definitely stay here again on any further visits.
",5,2017,07,10
211,EXCELLENT Croke Park Hotel Staff,"I would highly recommend staying in The Croke Park Hotel, Dublin as the staff are all absolutely so helpful, kind and friendly. Nothing is too much for any of the staff. The rooms are clean, bright and an excellent size. It is a 4* Hotel with 5* Service.

",5,2017,07,10
211,Stayed for a concert ,"But wow one of the nicest hotels I've stayed at in Ireland in a good while! The room lovely and spacious as was the bathroom, which was also super clean. Even though we stayed while there was a gig in croke park it was so quiet at night and well insulated! The staff were super Friendly on arrival. We'd such a lovely experience that we canceled our other hotel in the city for next weekend, and rebooked with these guys! ",5,2017,07,09
211,Great Stay for work,"Stayed here with work. Was just after a match day, but the hotel was spotless which is no easy task. Really nice room, warm welcome, great breakfast, friendly staff. Overall very enjoyable stay! Would defiantly recommend ",5,2017,07,09
211,"Helpful staff, silent rooms.","We stayed 9 nights at this hotel. Every staff member we encountered was friendly and helpful. We were on the first floor facing the stadium. I was disappointed at first because I am a light sleeper and I was sure this was a recipe for disaster. The room was SILENT. The windows are thick and seal well. The room was cleaned thoroughly every day and while we did have a few small issues (key cards always fail) every problem or request was handled quickly and with a smile. The hotel is a bit of a walk to the city center, maybe 10-15 minutes, but I prefer a quieter place to settle in for the night so this was more of a benefit than a hassle.",5,2017,07,08
211,Excellent Stay,"Enjoyable stay. Even on a busy match day the staff were accommodating. The room was comfortable and I slept soundly. Was just a short walk into the centre. The surrounding roads are busy on Sundays in summer, but I was given plenty notice of this by the hotel.
My choice of hotel any time I need to stay near Dublin city centre.",5,2017,07,08
211,Great Hotel,"The Croke Park was lovely. Very clean with helpful and friendly staff. My only complaint is it is a hike to get anywhere from there. If you want a place where you can stop off to have a quick shower or change your clothes while in the city, it's not for you. But, we left early in the morning and came back after dinner, for the night. Lots of $ in taxis to get to and from the hotel. As I said tho, very nice hotel.",4,2017,07,05
211,Premium quality accommodation in Dublin,"Excellent stay, as per usual in The Croke Park Hotel.  Superb staff, superior comfort, and great food make this hotel a great choice always.  The location is excellent for GAA events, but is also convenient to the city centre.",5,2017,07,04
211,SCORED AT CROKE PARK,On of the best hotels I have stayed in. Perfect for a conference in Croke Park across the road.Staff a credit to themselves and the hotel.Very good room and parking.Well designed with the customer away from home in mind.,5,2017,07,03
211,Good night of sleep,"Convenient located half way the city and the airport, I was booked in this hotel for a short night of sleep. Check in and out was quick. Staff very friendly. Room was decently sized, perfect bed. No complains",5,2017,07,01
211,Amazing stay at the end of a Long trip,"After 10 days of AirBnB's we came into the Croke Park Hotel.  It was as if the weight had been lifted from my shoulders.  whisked in, checked in, quick shower in an amazing bathroom, room set to chilly, off for complementary cocktail - amazing dinner at the bar with lots of great input from Sean the Bartender and his Boss Mr. O'brian - New Menu is amazing as well.  Although this is not ""Centrally"" located, it is quiet and a taxi is not expensive.  For Americans, this is the hotel to stay in while in Dublin - you will be amazed at the ambiance, service and support.",5,2017,06,30
211,Excellent Hotel - Why stay anywhere else in Dublin?!,"What can I say about this hotel: superb service, exceptional staff and fantastic food.  I’ve used this hotel on a number of occasions now and I have only ever had positive experiences.  From the moment I step in the door I automatically feel welcome, the staff go out of their way to help and make your stay as comfortable as possible.     

I stayed in a room on the 4th floor (the executive floor) and had access to the Executive Suite which makes life so much easier when away from home.  The hotel rooms are of an exceptional standard, spotlessly clean, a great size with extremely comfortable beds.  I think this is the only hotel I get a full night’s sleep in!  

I used the restaurant during my stay and it was fantastic; they have plenty of variety on the menu and a great wine list.  Breakfast was equally good with a vast array of options including streaky bacon!  .  

The location also works for me, it has great parking and is within walking distance of the city centre.  

However I cannot praise the staff enough – the level customer service is exceptional, the whole team contribute to the experience of staying here.  Not to focus on anyone in particular however during my last stay Sean, Orla and Peter really went out of their way to ensure I had a comfortable stay.",5,2017,06,29
211,Great atmosphere and friendly staff,"We were 26 persons in a conference for two days, and had a truly great experience with friendly staff, good facilities, good food and a nice and quiet location. The staff was very helpful and made it into a seamless experience for us.",5,2017,06,29
211,Fantastic Luxurious Property With Free Parking and Close To City Center,"Had a fabulous night's stay at The Croke Park Hotel.  Didn't have one negative thing to say about the property.

SUITE
- Extremely clean and spacious
- Bed comfy and the pillow's were HEAVENLY

SERVICE
- Overall service from check-in to check-out was spot on.  Super friendly staff that were also very helpful

LOCATION
- This hotel is located right next door to Croke Park where Gaelic games are played
- Not in the city centre but that's a good thing because the hotel has free parking
- Easy to grab a cab and go into the city (costs roughly 10 EUR)

BREAKFAST
- Our package included breakfast and WOW the pastries were YUMMY.  ",5,2017,06,28
211,Croke Park Hotel,"Excellent hotel, well maintained throughout with a highly professional and friendly staff.  I've stayed here half a dozen times over the last couple of years and always come away well rested.  It's good value versus its peers in Dublin: the one point is dropped as a commentary on Dublin hotel prices in general, not the hotel specifically.  Rooms are well appointed and comfortable: I've always been reluctant to leave the very comfortable bed.  I've not used the leisure facilities so cannot comment on those.  Bistro menu is a no-nonsense affair.  Anything I've had is perfectly executed and beautifully presented.  In terms of location, it's obviously perfect to Croke Park Stadium itself.  the immediate neighbourhood is less than salubrious and limited enough from an alternative dining experience perspective.  It is though just a quick stroll to the O'Connell Street area, but if you're looking to go south city centre then probably best to use taxis. ",5,2017,06,28
211,Lives up to expectations.,"Sensibly-designed rooms and comfortable bed. Good hot breakfast includes Irish wheaten bread (or soda, whatever you prefer to call it). Roomy bathroom with long bath. Walls a bit thin? I could hear next room's music. Easy to go on bus to and from airport (as long as you're not carrying too much) and handy for town centre (I walked my legs off). A longer, but pleasant walk, will take you to the botanic garden and a nice Breton cafe. Only thing I don't like about this hotel is the card key activation necessary for lift. I use the stairs therefore. Staff are excellent and welcoming, especially concierge who is a true pro.",4,2017,06,27
211,Spacious and modern,"Lovely hotel, all staff were very accommodating and friendly throughout the stay. Breakfast was delicious and offered everything you could want! The showers were great which is something I look for in a hotel! They offer a gym too which I had no time to avail of :(  it was a bit expensive but I hope to be back!",4,2017,06,27
211,Surprisingly nice stay,"We had a great stay here. The hotel is very comfortable and the staff were super. The lounge area with the tv and the fireplace near the bar was lovely! We took a taxi downtown to eat and see the sights, which was very easy. There were plenty of shops and restaurants within walking distance. I would definitely recommend this hotel if you don't mind being away from the center of town.",5,2017,06,27
211,Great Place,"Perfect business Hotel. Right across a big Stadium. Close to City Center. Very organized. Spacious rooms, very clean. Breakfast and meals to recommend. Staff very friendly. Tansportation to Airport approximately 15 minutes.",5,2017,06,27
211,Great friendly welcome at Croke Park,"Very welcoming and knowledgable staff, beautiful rooms and comfy lounges. Easy walk into town and hotel offers hop on hop off bus connection. Good breakfast available later than many hotels on a weekday",5,2017,06,27
211,Hospitality Plus,"this is the second time we have stayed here and it never disappoints us. very friendly staff, great concierge, the bar and lounge is amazing with a huge TV and great fireplace. perfect for a few Guinness's and cocktails. rooms are comfortable and the executive floor has a small but welcome self serve tea coffee and light breakfast. Perfect for a quick breakfast in bed run....its a 20 minute walk to the cbd and there is a great (really great) Italian restaurant 50 metres away. Love the Croke Park",5,2017,06,26
211,Nice Hotel,Stayed here before. We booked here for family friends 60th for one night. 2 rooms. Was a lovely gesture in the room. A card and bottles of prosecco was lovely thought. Thank You. Rooms are lovely and comfortable. Was a bit of a smell in one of the rooms maybe cause people are standing outside the front door smoking and its blowing back up to that room. Nice hot shower. Breakfast was great. Great selection. Didn't eat here for dinner so can't comment on that. ,4,2017,06,26
211,really comfortable,was here for a work event. room was really comfortable with a good shower. cannot complain about the room in general. Staff were friendly and helpful - although bar service could be a little slow. Key card entry was a touch temperamental.,4,2017,06,26
211,"Great Hotel, Location not great","When booking a hotel for our stay in Dublin, I looked to tripadvisor and a good rate. We were very pleased with the service, room, restaurant/bar. The concierge was outstanding. I wish I could remember his name, but very friendly and accommodating. Great advise and directions when we asked about particular buses and places to see. We were a little disappointed by how far it was from the downtown area. We were looking for a place to eat on our walk home and there really isn't much around the hotel. We did end up finding an Italian restaurant down the street and it was excellent. Again, great hotel and service, just make sure you map out the area.",4,2017,06,26
211,Stay Here when in Dublin,"Excellent, clean, well located and friendly, efficient in the Croke Park Hotel, Dublin. The bedrooms are very well kept, warm yet airy and have all necessary requirements with a choice of pillows and bed linen.  The furniture throughout this hotel is very well maintained and modern.  There are plenty of quiet areas to read or just watch what's going on around you.  The bathroom suites are spotless.
We highly recommend staying here.  The location is also central and about 15 minutes walk to the city centre.
",5,2017,06,26
211,Great place,"We stayed for a weekend visit at the end of June.  The hotel is located north of the Liffey and is around 20 - 25 minutes walk into the city centre.  

The staff are extremely friendly and helpful.  The rooms are a good size and well appointed.  

It's a good base for a sightseeing trip in Dublin.  Though if you don't want to spend extra on taxis or don't want to walk into the city centre each day then a hotel in the centre may be better for you.",5,2017,06,26
211,Fabulous,"While this isn't located in the touristy area, it is quiet and easily accessible. We booked it with frequent flier miles and were thus afforded a junior suite on the executive floor, which features a 24-hour executive lounge with complimentary snacks and non-alcoholic beverages, as well as a place to chill when jet lag has you wide awake at 3AM and your partner is fast asleep. It's also just beside the Enterprise car rental location, which makes it a very convenient location indeed.",5,2017,06,24
211,Excellent hotel for exploring Dublin,"We were extremely happy with our stay at The Croke Park. The service was excellent, especially from the concierge desk. When we dropped off our bags with the concierge well prior to check-in time, we were offered a map of the city, given detailed instructions regarding how to get to what we wanted to see, and even offered an umbrella which we much appreciated. The room was both clean and comfortable. Location is a bit of a walk to the main tourist areas of town, but definetely doable and didn't go through any sketchy areas.",5,2017,06,23
211,Comfortable homebase for Dublin,"The hotel is on the north side outside of the city center near the Gaelic Croke Park Stadium, but an easy, inexpensive cab ride into to sites and quite reasonable if you like walking. The service staff were friendly, efficient and well-trained. The rooms were cheerful, clean, and very comfortable. We signed up for the full breakfast which kept us going until well into the afternoon. We'd definitely stay there again.",5,2017,06,23
211,Very nice,"I was in a hotel for 2 nights and i loved it. Nice and very spacious rooms. Friendly staff. Breakfast was much better than expected... so great value for the money, though that hotel is not cheap.... there is also a great stadion near by, that offers nice view of the city.",5,2017,06,23
211,5* excellent! ,"Could not fault this hotel at all. We arrived at the hotel at 8am. Didn't expect to be able to check in but wanted to drop our bags off. A room was ready so they let us check in. Staff were excellent, even the cleaners were cheery and spoke to us. The hotel and rooms were very clean. Rooms very large and modern. Had a bath as well as a walk in shower. Even had a double and a single bed in the room. Good air con and we were treated to some yummy expensive chocolates that were left in the room. The toiletries were 'The White Company' and the towels in the bathroom were nice and big and fluffy. It was about a 20 minute walk into the centre of Dublin. Taxi to and  from the airport was €20 - €25. We were there to see Robbie Williams at the Aviva and we walked there from the hotel. We were told it should take about 20minutes but it took us an hour. Not sure if we went the right way. The weather was red hot though so may have slowed us down. Take plenty of spending money. When we checked out the reception gave us bottles of water free of charge. It was a very hot day. Dublin is expensive. Been to Dublin quite a few times but prices seem to have shot up. For a beer and a single vodka and coke it was €20. If we go again I'd stay at the Croke Park every time. We didn't try the breakfast but wish we had. I'd imagine it to be great. ",5,2017,06,22
211,"Great facilities and staff, not prime location","We booked at The Croke Park hotel because more central/tourist locations of Dublin were either booked full or too expensive for our budget. The hotel itself was a fantastic facility. Desk staff was able to change our reservation to give us two separate beds, the room was clean, and the concierge staff was very helpful. The only drawback was its location. As a traveler looking to spend time in Dublin, this hotel is a little out of the way. Any trip into city-center requires either a 25 min walk (which locals recommended we not attempt at night), a taxi, or knowledge of the local bus system. We ended up booking tickets on the Hop On/Hop Off tourist bus that pulled up outside in the morning. This made it easy for us to get in and around the city for the day, but still required us to take a cab home at night after the bus stops running (which is fairly early if you're looking to stay out and enjoy all the live music Dublin has to offer). If you're willing to put a little bit of extra work into your transportation, this is a prime facility. ",4,2017,06,21
211,Great hotel!,"Rooms were a nice size, clean, and well priced. Breakfast was good, I would just go with the continental instead of the full. Plenty of food, and better priced. You have to take an Uber or cab to get anywhere, except for the Croke stadium.",4,2017,06,20
211,Croke Park Hotel,This was a nice place.   Room were roomy.  Staff was nice.  The only problem was that the sports fans from the nearby sports park crowded the bars and were very loud.  Their children were unsupervised and running all over the place.,4,2017,06,20
211,Simply a 5 star,"Wonderful service and rooms.
get a room  on 4th floor so you have access to the executive lounge! 
You have 24 hour coffee and snacks 
, lounge and TV, etc.
Staff are very  accommodating and friendly. 
Close to airport.",5,2017,06,18
211,1 night stay,"Was here for one night. My room was clean and comfy. My window faced a street right across from the stadium, had no issues with noise. I had the breakfast buffet the next morning and it was great had lots to choose from. The staff was both friendly and courteous. No complaints definitely will return.
 ",5,2017,06,16
211,Most Exceptional Hotel In Dublin,"My wife and I had a wonderful stay on our honeymoon to Ireland. The staff were helpful, rooms were spacious/clean, and the breakfast was exceptional every day! Parking was convenient, and the concierge were very resourceful, with the best suggestions for someone on their first trip to Dublin.",5,2017,06,15
211,"Great hotel, great value","Hotel has all amenities (parking, restaurant, lounge/bar). Rooms are larger than I had expected. Located in quiet area, and is a short walk to the city center. I usually stay with large hotel chains for business, but was very pleased with my stay at the Croke Park!",5,2017,06,15
211,Great atmosphere and lovely staff,"I'm just home from a lovely Sunday meal at The Croke Park ... all the staff in the bar are really nice but Thomas especially looked after us .. thank you Thomas :-) We both had salmon with mash potatoes and spinach .. so nice and lovely coffee to finish. 
The atmosphere is lovely .. all calm ,, just what you need to relax on a Sunday 
Keep up the good work",5,2017,06,11
211,Great stay ,Stayed here on business for 1 night. Hotel was easy to find and got upgraded to an executive room which was nice! Room was great although there was no guide on the television so you didn't know what was on. Had dinner here and the food was good but the waiter service wasn't great as  I asked for a drink that was forgotten about and the next one was delivered to the wrong table. Saying that I would stay here again demo the location and the comfy room,5,2017,06,11
211,Beautiful Hotel,"This is an amazing hotel. Lovely staff, food excellent, rooms very clean and comfortable.  Location great as its not in the city but close enough to get a taxi at a reasonable price.  Definitely be back for another chill out weekend.",5,2017,06,09
211,Best of Scotland and Ireland for the price !,"Croke Park hotel has all of the amenities you could ask for and also some extra special touches in their rooms: trouser press, separate tub and shower, ice machine (not so common in Europe), free covered car park and thick towels. The location is also very convenient to the Dublin city centre. The breakfast was filling and delicious. ( The fresh honeycomb was so unique and delicious!)  We also found the desk staff friendly and accommodating- especially Valentina.  We got the package which included the hop on hop off bus and that was such a worthwhile way to see the city.  Definitely our best stay over the past two weeks in Scotland and Ireland!  ",5,2017,06,08
211,Great service ,"We really liked this hotel. The staff was amazing and so helpful. You can get Euros at the front desk and they help with tours and transportation. We ate breakfast and it was very good and had a nice selection. We also ate dinner at the bar, which was very good- the burgers are huge- and the staff was great! Our only negative is the lack of airport transport. We did get a taxi for 20 euro. ",4,2017,06,07
211,"Great service, nice rooms and a fair price","Owing to its location a bit off the beaten tourist path, you get a nice experience here while paying a bit less. I was impressed with the staff and the bar service. It's a bit of a hike to the River Liffey and the heart of the tourist district, but manageable. I actually enjoyed the neighborhood feel of this place. Obviously, it's a premier choice if you're going to Croke Park itself as well. A minor quibble, but I'm docking a star for the rather pedestrian free breakfast, which was acceptable but the least appealing of any among the five hotels we stayed at in Ireland.",4,2017,06,07
211,Beautiful Atmosphere,"We stayed in this hotel for our anniversary weekend and it did not disappoint. The staff were extremely friendly and helpful, and they didn't even mind that due to our flight delays we arrived in the middle of the night! Gari the night manager still offered us some water and a hot cloth to freshen up on arrival. The lounge area was warm and inviting and the rooms were lovely too. Krishna the concierge was very helpful with planning our visit. I can't find anything to fault here, will be back to stay again next year! ",5,2017,06,06
211,Excellent Budget Option near city,"We loved our experience at the Croke Park hotel. Walked into town (15-20min), and caught a cab back in the evening for 10 euro. Close enough to have a good time, but far enough to get a good, quiet night's sleep! Definitely great value relative to expensive options in downtown Dublin. I would certainly stay here again.",4,2017,06,06
211,Pleasantly suprirsed,"At first it was difficult to find because my Navigation origianlly too me to the entrance to Croke park the actual field and not the hotel, but the hotel was the next block over. Everyone was very pleasant and the included breakfast was very delicious. The choices did not change from day to day but it was still very good. The elevator was a bit small but nothing to complain about. Overall this hotel was very wonderful and i would definitely stay here again",5,2017,06,06
211,Wheelchair access,"I visited Croke Park Hotel last Saturday night with a couple of friends, one a wheelchair user.  It has been a few years since I have been in the hotel. It is a very good hotel all round, food, service etc. but the wheelchair accessible toilet near the bar/restaurant/foyer is still the same - inaccessible for a person using a powered wheelchair.  On this occasion my friend was in a manual chair which just about fits in.  On previous occasions she has had her powered chair and has not been able to use the toilet.  This is very disappointing as surely there have been complaints made since we were last there.",4,2017,06,06
211,Excellent Value,Excellent value for money with great parking facilities. Only a ten minute taxi into town but also only 20 min drive to the airport. The rooms and facilities were excellent as were the friendliness of the staff.,5,2017,06,06
211,Croke park above expectations,"Had a really enjoyable stay at Croke Park, very convenient position to the city centre, just a 10 minute walk. Having parking facilities was great, as trying to park in Dublin is a nightmare.
The staff were very helpful, and the breakfasts were very good.
We had a meal in the bistro, the food was very good, will definitely stay again. Bill and Jenny waters.",5,2017,06,05
211,Very nice hotel,"The hotel is situated about 15 mins walk from Dublin centre but the 'hop on hop off' bus service runs to the hotel. The room was very clean and the staff were warm and welcoming. The breakfast was excellent also. The only down side to our visit was how expensive everything is in Dublin, but that's not the hotels fault.",5,2017,06,05
211,Wonderful experience,"My previous review failed to appear so better luck this time! My sisters and I visited Dublin in April to celebrate their birthdays. From check in to departure we had gold star service. Staff were unfailingly polite and helpful. We had a ""triple"" bedroom. It was roomy, very quiet with comfortable beds. The standard of cleanliness in both our bedroom and public areas was high. We ate at the hotel and the food was reasonably priced and very good quality. Though the hotel is out from the centre it is an easy 20 minute walk to O'Connell street. Thank you for a lovely stay.",5,2017,06,05
211,just the right amount of formality and friendly,"wonderful hotel facilities, fabulous food - I really recommend the vegetarian club sandwich from the Sideline Bar - I couldn't eat a thing the next morning!  Great atmosphere with friendly professional staff.  Lovely room - so nice to have decent sized glasses, lights that work and a lovely clean bathroom.. I never have a bath in a hotel because they are nearly always horrid - I had two here!  Wonderful stay",5,2017,06,05
211,Great hotel - convenient location,"Very friendly staff, nice and clean room, great extra services (free breakfast, water). Location is good, a 20 minute walk downtown. Or you grab one of the Coke Zero bikes. Great way to get around. Definitely recommended.",5,2017,06,04
211,Nice Hotel by The Stadium,"Really a lovely hotel with the stadium across the street. Nice rooms, well stocked and comfortable beds. The staff is very welcoming and helpful!  Good food and a fabulous bar area. Easy walk to O'Connell Street and the Temple Bar area. 
The Concierge, Stephen, was very helpful in setting up a day tour for us outside the city. 
Highly recommend this hotel!!!
",5,2017,06,03
211,Nice couple of days stay,"Lovely hotel with nice facilities, the room was comfortable and extra ability to use executive breakfast relaxation room. Only issue was shower and sink water power was a little lacking in pressure. Breakfast was lovely and evening meal in bistro was tasty and of nice quality. ",4,2017,06,03
211,My big birthday,I stayed here 2 weekends ago with another 2 couples and had a fantastic weekend. The staff could not have been nicer or more helpful.  We were upgraded on our second night which was lovely. The staff sang happy birthday to me on the morning of my birthday and when my friend asked them they decorated my room with banners and balloons.  We only ate breakfast in the hotel and everyone enjoyed the food.  Great hotel give it a visit.,5,2017,06,02
211,"Nice hotel, nice rooms, nice staff","This is a very modern, well-appointed hotel.  We stayed on the 4th floor, which is designated as the executive floor (I guess?) and had access to the lounge. I didn't end up using it much, but it had a selection of teas and a coffee machine, as well as bottled water and juices, which was nice. 

The rooms were great - very clean, very well maintained, looked pretty new. The TV was a bit small, but I don't watch much TV so it wasn't a big deal.  They have a turn-down service, which is nice to come back to in the room. 

The hotel is situated a bit far from the city center - about a 20 minutes ride. Taxis are about 15 euro to get downtown. If you are driving, be prepared to search for a place to park. It's really a 50/50 on whether you shell out for a taxi or spend the time and energy finding a place to park downtown. I did both, but they both have their upsides. Parking is free at the hotel, which is nice.

One thing that is a drawback at this hotel is there is not any outlets near the bed. So forget having your laptop or phone plugged in and near you. Not sure why this was an oversight? Very mind boggling. 

Internet is a little slow, but not terribly so. It was adequate.",5,2017,06,02
211,Very unwelcoming ,"This was a really nice hotel, but the staff really let it down. For the price I paid for my room for 1 night (€190) you would expect to be made welcome, that was not the case. I would not recommend staying here.",2,2017,06,01
211,Five day stay,"This hotel is situated opposite from the National Rugby Stadium and is quite easy to get to from Dublin airport although you are about 2 km from the city centre. This is a nice hotel with comfortable rooms with good facilities, although, some part are a little dated. The bed was too soft for us and the views are not great. The in room TVs are very old and it was difficult to navigate to the somewhat meagre channel selection. The check in staff and restaurant staff were excellent and very attentive to our every need. The buffet breakfast was excellent and great value at 12 euros per head. They have a very nice bar and rest area with huge LED TVs and they also have a small library sectioned off from the main reception area.
Our biggest gripe was the loud banging of room doors just after 6.00am every morning, therefore, we never really had a lie in to a reasonable get up time on our holiday.",4,2017,06,01
211,Nice Dublin hotel,"We spent our last night in Ireland at the Croke Park Hotel. It is a quick drive in a taxi to the heart of Dublin, it's activities, shopping, restaurants, and pubs.  We found the hotel clean and modern, with a very helpful and welcoming staff.  We had a nice breakfast before leaving and had an easy drive to the airport.",5,2017,06,01
211,Top class staff!,"We stayed in Croke Park hotel in a family room for two nights, on bank holiday wkend minibreak and would thoroughly recommend this hotel to other families. Our room was spacious, clean and very comfortable, the kids loved being able to listen to their music on the CD system, and the separate shower unit in bathroom was excellent. We ate in the hotel bar one night and the menu was varied and offered much more than standard bar fare, we all enjoyed our food.  But what impressed us most was the staff!!  In particular Peter, the bar manager.  On the monday night we were celebrating my son's 8th bday, I had asked the waiter if they could bring out a cake and candles I had brought, which they made really fun, even singing happy birthday. Peter gave us and Patrick in particular, extra attentive service making him feel special and 'grown-up'. To top off a lovely meal and celebration, when we got back to our room Peter had arranged little suprise and card for Patrick. A very chuffed little boy,  Top class service!!! Thankyou Peter!!! ",5,2017,05,31
211,Looking at the stars...,"Not the most salubrious part of town, but the Hotel hasn't noticed.   I don't think it has five stars (correct me if I'm wrong) but you get 5 star service.  Everything about the place, the room, the welcome to the farewell.  Hotel staff, bar staff, concierge all 5-star and giving a  friendly and genuine service.  Thanks.  The room was good, nothing spectacular but everything you'd need in good clean order.  We has use of an executive lounge on the 4th floor, which was also the venue for an inclusive continental breakfast.  Once again well done, with friendly service.  So it may not be from the best area in town or be a five star big boy, but it has aspirations and lives up to them admirably. 

Down side? It's a bit far out of town and taxis aren't cheap.  Upside?  Some of the funniest and most helpful taxi drivers I've had the pleasure to listen to.",4,2017,05,30
211,Very Nice Hotel,This hotel is very nice and well laid out. Great area and close to alot of tourist things. The hotel is really clean and just across from the the world famous Croke Park stadium. The breakfast is also outstanding.,4,2017,05,30
211,"Good location, and an even better restaurant!","The room was spacious and comfortable. Staff was very friendly, and the check-in-and-out process was fast. Since the hotel sits right on the outskirts of Dublin city center, and it takes about 20 minutes to walk to many city attractions. However, this is worth it because the hotel offers free and secure parking (a rarity in Dublin center). The highlight of our stay was the restaurant. We normally try to avoid hotel food, but this restaurant was an exception! The Irish breakfast offered here was a daily treat - the blood pudding and fresh honey alone made the stay worth it! Great room, friendly staff, amazing restaurant, and secure parking - I would definitely stay here again, and recommend the same to others.",5,2017,05,28
211,Lovely comfortable hotel,A short taxi ride away from the 3 arena we were there for a concert. Lovely comfortable rooms and nice bar and food. Only thing I thought there glass of processo was overpriced at €10. But overall would recommend this hotel. Staff are friendly.,5,2017,05,25
211,Short Break in Dublin,"Decided to book The Croke Park Hotel after reading previous reviews.  Wasn't disappointed, check in quick, efficient and friendly.  Didn't take long to travel from airport, opted for a taxi to get there directly.  Our room was larger than expected and bathroom was a good size with shower and bath separate.  Slept well with no awareness of any neighbouring noises.  Had a choice of pillows to pick from.  
We had cooked breakfast which was buffet style and it was lovely.
Most days we walked into the city centre (taking about 15 mins) apart from one morning when we travelled in with shuttle hop on/hop off bus picked up directly outside from the hotel as we were catching another of their buses to go to the Guinness Factory.  We bought our bus tickets via the hotel.
We had one evening meal at the hotel which again was lovely but due to the size of the portions only able to manage one course.
Check out was 5am due to flight time but reception area/lounge area still busy with ""fresh looking"" guests.
Hotel looks very attractive inside and outside.  Restaurants' decor very stylish.  Staff friendly and helpful within restaurants and reception.  Would certainly book again.",5,2017,05,23
211,The Croke Park,"This was the highlight place we stayed on our trip.
We were greeted with a smile and a hot towel,   The staff were the best.   Every time we went out we were given a bottle of water.   The room was neat and tidy, the meals were great, with both hot and cold food available.   A short taxi ride to the centre of Dublin City.",5,2017,05,23
211,Lovely Hotel,"I stayed in this hotel for two weeks when I was over for business, and this hotel did not disappoint. The arrangements for a room was done in less than 15 minutes, and even our arrangements for daily transport were quick to be addressed. 

If you are staying in this hotel, make sure you have included breakfast in your itinerary - otherwise, the location where it's at could be cumbersome if you want to grab a bite to eat. There are pubs and chippers around the area, but could be awkward if you want to have your breakfast early in the day. 

Staying at the croke park is enjoyable since it's a close walk to the city center. The staff are attentive, and the rooms are always clean everyday. The bed is always made up and it makes staying in a very good option! They also have a lush selection of toiletries - you wouldn't think they are hotel supplies! One comment on the bed though - the headboard is not attached to the bed itself so if you accidentally pushed the headboard, you can see your bed moving farther from the wall. It's a minor item I was not aware of but an item to note, just in case. 

It's good that this hotel provides facilities for ironing, parking, as well as pick up service to the nearby business parks. I was not made aware of the pick up from the business park and back to the hotel, but that added service would have made this the best place to stay in Dublin. 

I love their breakfast options especially their Irish breakfast and their pastries. The coffee served was a bit bitter - they could get too busy during rush hour - so would suggest you have your breakfast around 7:00 ish instead of 8:00 onwards.

Overall, I enjoyed my stay at the hotel, and would likely stay in the future. :)",4,2017,05,23
211,"Great hotel, great location, lovely staff","I have had the pleasure of staying at the Croke Park Hotel on a number of occasions over the last 2 years. I have found it to be an excellent hotel, very friendly and accomodating staff. Overall a great experience. I would reccommend it!",5,2017,05,23
211,Great Stay,"Very nice hotel across from the stadium.  The room was nice and big and very comfortable bed.  The breakfast buffet was fantastic.  The service provided was great.
The hotel is within walking distance to city center and there are plenty of bus stops close by.  There was a big football game on Saturday when we were there and we chose to go on a day trip to Giant causeway to avoid the huge crowd in the area.",5,2017,05,22
211,Our last Hotel stay in Dublin!  Lovely Room!,"This was our last hotel stay on our C.I.E. tour in Ireland.  It is very new and modern and the room was wonderful.  Our room had two double beds and was very spacious.  Lots of lights and many switches near the beds so no need to get up through the night to turn on a light.  We were here only a short time as we had a very early flight and had to leave at 5:00 a.m.  We were unable to visit the Croke Park Stadium which was located near to the Hotel.  We had a farewell drink in the bar/restaurant area.  It was very large and modern.  The service for drinks was a bit slow, but in all fairness it was very busy with many people.  Wish we could have spent more time here, but what we saw was impressive.  Staff were friendly and we would stay at this Hotel again if we ever vacation in Ireland again.  Worth a stay at this location!",5,2017,05,22
211,Great Hotel and Restaurant,"The room was amazing, very large and comfortable.  Huge, deep bathtub which was wonderful.  Hotel staff very helpful.  Food in the restaurant was consistently excellent.  Loved the continental breakfast in the morning.  ",5,2017,05,22
211,Excellent Hotel,"We felt very welcome and at home, the Croke Park Hotel contributed to a truly wonderful Irish vacation! I would gladly stay here again in the future and stay at some of their other hotels in other cities!!",5,2017,05,22
211,Fantastic Service!,Stayed here for 2 nights on business.  From the reception desk to the bar staff nothing was too much trouble.  We really enjoyed our stay and were made to feel very welcome.  The Superior double rooms were very clean and comfortable.  Would recommend this hotel.,5,2017,05,22
211,Great stay,"Hotel is out of the way ( and believe me that the best way to be) but not too far. Easy to get to the centre where the hotels are of a much less standard for more money. Room, service and staff were great. If you dont want the walk to the centre ( 15 mins) the 'jump on jump off' buss stops right outside and the taxi drivers dont rip you off neither !",5,2017,05,21
211,Wonderful hotel,"We stayed here the last night on our CIE Tour of Ireland. The room was spacious, the bed & pillows extremely comfortable, bathroom the largest one of any on the tour. Staff very helpful. The only downside is its quite far from city center but still a top notch hotel.",5,2017,05,18
211,Kroke Park,"Contemporary hotel  with clean modern rooms.  Staff was wonderful and willing to help in any way.  Food as very good, but the breakfast buffet while good was somewhat pricey for the selections offered.  They were helpful in arranging tours and offering advice.",5,2017,05,18
211,communication is key,"we booked our two nights separately. one through an online booking site and then when we decided to stay a second night I contacted the hotel via email.There were no problems with this. 
Parking was plentiful and is complimentary so that was great. My friend and I arrived separately and I checked in as I had an appointment to keep. On my way back I was getting texts from my friend saying there was a problem with our second night booking, which basically came from staff not communicating with each other. Human error.
We attended the Take That concert that night and ordered room service on our return. It was delicious. But when we awoke there was a bill for the room service plus two alcoholic beverages from the mini bar which we did not consume....again human error and a very sensitive sensor in the mini bar.
We didn't have breakfast on the first morning and the mini bar issue was resolved.
We attended the second Take That concert and returned back to chocolates and champagne by way of apology. Which was the perfect end to our two concerts.
The hotel staff are very friendly and warm. Our issues were definitely from lack of communication.
We had food in the sideline bistro before we attended the second concert and it was a huge portion and very tasty.
Our breakfast on the second morning was very nice as well. No complaints on the food front whatsoever and a huge choice on the menu both for breakfast and dinner.
Staff would have been more than happy to order in from fast food restaurants also if we had wanted too.
The room was spacious and very clean. The bathroom well supplied with towels. It had a bath and a separate shower.Lovely toiletries as well.
Apart from the communication issues we enjoyed our stay.",4,2017,05,18
211,A welcomed respite for a very weary traveler,"Anne (trainee) on the front desk was my first clue that this hotel was going to be great!!  She treated me with outstanding service, a warm smile, a dynamic personality and a hot towel to wash up!!!  The room was terrific (lay out of the floors is rather weird) and having a radio/CD player was a very nice touch.  Pub meals were great and the Guinness was PERFECT!!  Only wish I could have stayed there much longer.",5,2017,05,18
211,A great hotel,"We stay at the Croke Park hotel because its really a super place, friendly staff, great food and a lovely bar.
The rooms are clean and spacious and the I always have a good nights sleep there.
Car parking is free for guests and you are really not far from anywhere, the city centre is close and so is the Airport, there are lots of taxies outside the hotel and if they are busy the hotel will order one and it will be there within 5 minutes.",5,2017,05,18
211,Very convenient Hotel,"I stayed for one week at the Croke Park Hotel which was very close to my workplace in Eastpoint, the room was very nice and spacious, although i think the TV is kind of old and small. the breakfast was very nice with a variety of choices, the restaurant and bar were very nice for watching the football games. But overall it is a very good and affordable hotel.",4,2017,05,18
211,Great stay great hotel ,Good hotel good staff good everything  good value Irish people very friendly clean  what more can I say had a really nice stay in the hotel used the bar in the evening with complimentary nuts and crisps  on the last day we were able to leave our luggage until we were ready to make our way to the airport ,5,2017,05,17
211,"Great hotel,",Great hotel with staff and accommodations. Just not as centrally located as had hoped. Great Italian restaurant a book away! Try it. Hop on hop off bus stops right here. We took a taxi to trinity college to see book of Kells. ,4,2017,05,17
211,Really enjoyable stay,We liked everything about this hotel. We were greeted warmly nod offered warm hand towels to refresh ourselves after our journey from England. Our room was in the 4th floor where we had access to the executive lounge which was an added bonus. Our room was quiet and spotlessly clean. We enjoyed tasty breakfasts and found the staff very helpful and attentive. We ate in the Sideline Bar each evening. Choice was limited but in all other respects very nice.,5,2017,05,17
211,short break,"Good sized rooms with large ensuite, very clean, staff very helpful food was hit and miss one meal was excellent the other was bad enough to get our money refunded. Hotel a little to far out of the city centre unless you like a long walk.although it's a short walk to the hop on hop off tour buses to the city centre. overall a good hotel and would not hesitate to go back.",4,2017,05,17
211,Convenient to the Stadium !,I had four stays here during the month! My first was the day of a football game! I sort of was swept away when I left the hotel. I am sure the locals were aware. It is only a 15 minute walk to Parnell St from the hotel and there are quite a few bus going to the city center. The hotel offer a well appointed room and the breakfast was quite good! I would stay again!,5,2017,05,17
211,"Great Check In & a few niggles, but would return","We arrived at lunch time & I was expecting to leave our bags in storage and have to come back later for our room but we were lucky and our room was ready. The girl who checked us in was very nice and friendly. 
I had gotten tickets with my package for the hop on hop off bus so when I asked where was the bus stop I was very disappointed when I was told that there is only one pick up and it was at 11am. What is the point in having these tickets in a one night stay package????? We had planned to do this for the afternoon as it was the only time we had, the timing of the pick up of the bus should be advised at the time of booking but it wasn't. 
We had a balcony off the room, the door was locked and there was no keys. I had to ring reception to ask how to open the door. The porter had to come up to open the door and he was leaving with the keys & I asked was he not leaving them & we were told no that we would have to ring reception again when we wanted the door locked. The was very inconvenient.
We walked to the city centre which was a nice 20 minute stroll as it was a dry day and we also walked back. 
We went to the bar that evening and found the service very slow.
Was not overly impressed with breakfast. Our waitress was very inexperienced. I asked for a coffee before my breakfast arrived and I had to wait 15 minutes and I had to ask someone else for it. Got an omelette for breakfast and it wasn't great.
Hotel was very clean, and bathrooms in the lobby were also kept lovely and clean.",3,2017,05,16
211,Comfy hotel. Helpful staff,"Not in the city center but still a great location right across the street from croke park stadium and a 15 min walk to the city center. Or buy a hop on hop off ticket and catch a shuttle bus to the city center from right outside the hotel entrance. 

The staff were very friendly and made sure we had everything we needed. We were greeted with warm hand towels at the front desk which was a really nice touch.   Krishna at the concierge desk was amazing to deal with. He helped us with every activity/excursion we asked about, tried to get us good deals where possible, and always made sure we were taken care of. 

The rooms were clean and comfy and has inviting decor. The bathrooms were well stocked with towels and other convenience items (they took into consideration that there were 3 people in the room and ensured there were enough supplies).

When checking out were were offered bottles of water for the road which again is a very nice touch especially when travelling as it's not always easy to stop over and buy bottled water.

It you're looking to rent a car, there is an Enterprise just up the street about 2 mins away. The breakfast also has quite a selection and definitely worth 12-15 euros. Would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone looking for a place to stay in Dublin.",5,2017,05,15
211,Communion in the canal room,I had my son's communion in the canal room on Saturday 13 of May. I had 25 guests for food. I cannot recommend this hotel enough. The room is FAB. A lovely outside area where the kids could run around. The food was excellent. But the best part was all the lovely staff from ciara in   events who helped me with the booking.  All the waiting staff. And the lovely manager who was there ( I can't remember her but the girl from drumcondra) Everyone was so friendly and helpful.  Thanks so much.,5,2017,05,15
211,Excellent hotel,"Excellent Hotel.  We were greeted with a warm welcome and hot towels to freshen up after the journey - nice touch! The decor is fabulous throughout, the staff were all lovely and friendly. We went out in Dublin that night and came back in very late looking for food so we ordered room service, it arrived very quickly and the sandwiches we ordered were delicious. The room was lovely and clean, the beds were really comfortable and there's nice big towels in the bathroom. There's also very good tea/coffee selection in the room, it was nice to have the choice of a herbal tea as well as the regular stuff. Another nice touch was to be given a bottle of water when checking out, especially after a night out!  Would definitely recommend to a friend and looking forward to visiting again myself.",5,2017,05,15
211,Éirinn go Brách,"Stayed one night and definitely a very nice modern hotel not too far from city centre by taxi (c €10) Friendly Irish staff. Rooms well appointed, light, airy and spotlessly clean. Fab bathroom with excellent separate shower unit and good toiletries (White Company). Great breakfast and plenty of it. Free wifi. Generally a great place to stay when in Dublin in the Green!",4,2017,05,13
211,Croke Park hotel,"Twenty five minute walk to Trinity University. But less than 15 from the tourist center. Hop on hop off has pickups in morning only- at front door. 1/2 hour 19 euro cab ride from airport. Free guest parking.

Good hot and cold breakfast. Meals at night were good. 

Staff are friendly and helpful without having to push them.",4,2017,05,12
211,WOW!,"I'm actually at this hotel as I write this review. I'm sitting in the Executive Lounge. The check in was efficient and very professional. I went to the bar for some food. Aoibheann is an absolute star. She's a credit to the hotel. The room is spotlessly clean. Massive bed. Excellent facilities.
Will definitely be returning! ",5,2017,05,09
211,Husbands 50th birthday,"The rooms were fab we had a balcony room , we was in a king room which had bath robes and slippers, the bed was sumptuous. The sideline bar was great it was always busy, staff friendly, prices of drinks not to bad for a hotel , would defo recommend this hotel .",5,2017,05,09
211,Quick over night visit ,"Convenient to Centre City Dublin and then To departure at Dublin International airport. Friendly staff and Executive floor was great! Easy parking, free wi-fi and comfortable beds. Bar was nice as well. ",5,2017,05,09
211,Best service I have ever experienced at a hotel!,"Although it isn't in the City Centre, I received some of the best service at this hotel. Staff are incredibly friendly and really do go above and beyond to ensure you enjoy your trip. The man at concierge recommended us some really great activities and helped us plan our weekend and was so lovely! The rooms are nice and very clean. There is a variety of options at breakfast to cater to all needs. It is only about 5/10 mins by car to get into the centre and I think it worked out about €7 by taxi which is nothing! - really great hotel and would definitely recommend.",5,2017,05,09
211,Great hotel ,Hotel was only a 15 minute walk to the main Dublin bars and shops. The hotel staff were friendly and quick to help. We couldn't get our safe to work and the maintenance fixed it within 10 minutes of us notifying. We ate in the restaurant and the food was excellent. Would definitely recommend.,5,2017,05,08
211,Nice hotel excellet service,I stayed just one night here but was especially impressed with the friendly helpful staff. They really try to make your stay as nice as possible. Good buffet breakfast. 20 minutes walk from city center or short cab ride. ,4,2017,05,07
211,Great Staff,"We stayed in the hotel for 5 nights in April. Our son was in Temple st hospital and as it was a bank holiday weekend we couldn't find any hotel available online. I called the croke park and explained. They offered a discounted rate and a room for as long as needed.
The hotel was 5 mins walk from the hospital and had free parking. They even gave take away boxes so we could bring breakfast to the hospital with us each morning. ",5,2017,05,06
211,Lovely place with friendly staff,"Stayed here in April for 2 nights. At first I was concerned that it was too far away from downtown, but the ""jump on, jump off bus"" stops right out front and proved to be an easy and cheap way to get around. A short taxi ride back is inexpensive as well. The hotel itself - the rooms, the bar and lounge areas, etc. - were all very nice. Clean, modern, and warm. The restaurant was nice, and food was good. The breakfast was very, very good and nicely presented. All of the staff were friendly, accommodating, and personable. I would definitely choose to stay here again.",5,2017,05,04
211,Our mystery tour to lovely Irland,"We where 11 girls from work, who stayed on this pleasent hotel from 28 of April to 1 of May 2017.
The cleaning was excellent in the rooms and everywere in the hotel.
The room was ok - clean and comfy bed, overlooking a backyard outside the window. But we was mostly outside.
The breakfast was quit nice, and the restaurant had nice food and service.
The bar was a cosy area with good Irish coffee & dessert's and comfy chair's & sofa's.
The service on this hotell was excellent! From we arrived with communication with Clare and Christopher on mails for bookings on taxi and dinnershow's,and preparations for our group!
Thank you so much! Christopher was very nice and serviceminded, as we had the chance to meet him in person and the manager at the reseption was highly pleasent. And Thomaz did his part to sort things out.
The only negative thing's was the keecard's for juse in the elevator and rooms - they stopped working sometimes.
And some problem's with the reservation of a VISAcard ( because our boss arrived earlier, and had to pay in advance for her room )

Thank you for a pleasent stay! We highly recommand you!",5,2017,05,04
211,Dreadful experience,"This is not a hotel I would recommend to anyone, food was dreadful, and the while some staff were friendly, others were very rude..
Overall I felt this Hotel was over priced, and I felt under valued as a customer. I will not and neither will my friends or family ever stay here again. I would visit Dublin a lot, and I have stayed in higher star hotels and same star hotels and to be honest the travel lodge has better staff and better service.",1,2017,05,03
211,Lovely Hotel,Stayed here for 3 nights for my daughter's hen do. Hotel is spotless and the staff very pleasant and extremely helpful. The rooms were spacious and cleaned to perfection. I can recommend the breakfasts and the bar snacks. Would definately come back. It does get busy on match days but the atmosphere was wonderful. Thank you for a pleasant stay. ,5,2017,05,03
211,Good,"We stayed here as we were going to an event and the room cost 150€ for the night for a double room. Lovely hotel spacious lobby. Rooms not to big but big enough. The staff were friendly. The breakfast cost 25€ and was extremely dry and a buffet style breakfast so on my next visit I would rather get breakfast else where. Room service wasn't great either. Food wasn't what I had wanted and I ordered ice cream that came warm and melted. The room service cost 55€ for a burger, chips, peri peri chicken, a selection of ice cream and a apple crumble. 
Overall this was a nice hotel and I would stay again as the beds were divine! I wouldn't order food again as it wasn't for me and dublin city center has so much more to offer. 
A taxi from here to the city center was only 7€. 
The only thing that would of bothered me was that the cleaning cart was left outside our room in the hallway and it seemed as if this was it's resting place. It made the hall ways seem dirty. 
",4,2017,05,02
211,Excellent Hotel,"I stayed here with my boyfriend for 3 nights. We used the free parking, the garage was secure and felt safe. You just have to get a ticket and the reception validate it for you. Our room was upgraded on arrival, oddly we were given a room with one double bed and one single bed, I'm not sure why but it didn't affect us in any way, we just stuck with the double! The room was very clean and comfortable. We got room service as we arrived late and were hungry. The sandwiches were nice. Breakfast is a buffet and my only complaint with this was that they didn't have baked beans two days running (not sure why someone couldn't have nipped to the shop!) as I don't eat meat I'm only left with eggs and toast when you take my beans away! Thankfully the staff were awesome and gave me pancakes as a replacement! The staff in general throughout our stay were lovely and helpful. We used the Hop On Hop Off bus service to see Dublin, we got the tickets from reception and there is a shuttle bus which picks you up right outside the hotel and takes you to join the main tour bus route. I recommend doing this as it was a great way to see the city and the tour guides were hilarious! The location of the hotel is a little bit away from the centre, I'd say a 20 minute walk. We walked back a couple of times and it's an easy walk. We also went to an Italian restaurant (Wallace's Asti) just down the road which did lovely food.",5,2017,05,02
211,Top Notch European Hotel,"This hotel is 15-20 minutes walk northeast of the spire in North Dublin. The room was larger then normal European rooms. The room was modern, the bed huge and comfortable, and bathroom spacious! The bar downstairs serves food, everything we had was yummy! Recommend a burger and fat fries. They played sports at night and weekend. The staff was helpful and always had answers to all my questions. They give you bottle water if you ask, which is nice. If i am ever in Dublin, will want to stay here!!",5,2017,05,02
211,Lovely hotel with the Best employees,We arrived in Dublin and headed straight to the hotel and were so excited when they were able to give us an early checkin.....Anna greated us with a smile and warm welcome.  The beds are very comfortable and the shower was great.  The food in the restaurant was delicious and loved the Irish breakfast.  When I asked about an electric converter Sophie was right on it.  Will definitely stay here again when I return to Dublin.,5,2017,05,02
211,Top Notch Customer Service at Croke Park,"Customer service is this hotel's shining star. Nice size room, very comfortable beds, nice bathroom, good food, ok bar area, a bit far from city center, but ample taxi service available. Convenient parking in garage directly under hotel. But the best part of staying here was how every staff member would go out of their way to fix any snag you might have to make your stay care free and enjoyable. 

We had to leave very early one morning for a group tour and someone in the restaurant fixed us up several boxes of fruit and pastries to take with us. We were very grateful! The front desk staff are wonderful, any issues don't be afraid to ask them for advice. Someone arranged a cab to be waiting for us for 2 mornings for our early tours. When another guest took our cab before we came downstairs (I think the driver thought he was there for them), someone at the front desk immediately snagged us another ride so we wouldn't miss our tour. Excellent service all around and would recommend this hotel to friends and family. ",4,2017,05,01
211,Lovely hotel in walking distance to much,"I enjoyed my stay very much at the Croke Park. It was conveniently located to EastPoint Business Park, both by walking or by a complementary shuttle. I was also able to walk to some restaurants on nearby Drumcondra Road and to some entertainment on O'Connell Street.
The hotel itself featured a fine restaurant, well-appointed rooms (though the technology could stand some updating) and a very friendly staff that was always eager to help me find my way around.",5,2017,05,01
211,Croke Park,"An Absolutely amazing establishment. Nothing is too much for this place and the staff, asking for directions or the best places to eat. Attention to detail is top notch and we could not fault this place at all. We mainly had breakfast, which is amazing and a must experience. Requested a quick bite and this was catered for immediately. I am passionate about good customer service and this is the BEST hotel we have stayed in, in regards to attention to detail and all the little things that count. I will definitely visit again and make it a must for anyone visiting the city.",5,2017,04,30
211,Everything great!,"I stayed here with a group of colleagues recently as we were hosting a conference across the road in the stadium. I enjoyed the hotel, and they met our needs really efficiently. 

The pre-conference dinner the evening before the conference was in the hotel's restaurant but if I'm honest that didn't really work as there were so many families and the noise level was a bit too high to have the type of conversations we needed to have.

Lovely room, and we enjoy the residents' bar hospitality...(apologies!) ;-)

We're booked to come back!

211,service will spoil you,"this place is great!  we arrived after less than pleasant journey, and were met with calm kindness from the reception staff.....along with warm cloths.   rooms were nice.  we were lucky to have access  to hospitality lounge, which was a great plus.  breakfast was wonderful.....we actually ate dinner there two nights, which is something we never do (eat at the hotels we stay in).  the food was very good!  i had lost my voice, and was trying to get over a sinus cold.  On two occasions, dining room staff members brought me their special concoction of hot water, lemon, and honey......i felt so cared for.   very welcome feeling.  without exception, staff was excellent.   makes you rethink our american standards.  Hamptons, which is our usual pick in the States, will never look quite as good to me again.  You have spoiled me, Croke Park.",5,2017,04,30
211,"Great Hotel , Great food and Wonderful staff","It was my daughter's 21st birthday and on arrival we were greeted with 2  bottles of Prosecco on ice and a lovely box of chocolates. The room was spacious and immaculate over looking Croke Park Stadium which turned out to be a bonus as we were able to watch an event taking place from our window. Breakfast is most deffinately one of the best I've had and I had an evening meal which was outstanding. Only criticism for the meal was the individual pricing. As I ordered a pork chop at €12 and was advised it didn't come with anything so had to order sides seperately which I did find unusual. The staff are very helpful and friendly and were able to offer personal advice on things to do. They also had a concierge to advise on places of interest and locations. The location from Dublin city centre and Temple bar area is a 20-25 minute walk and very straight forward. I would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone who loves comfort, space quality and doesn't want to be in the thick of the hustle and bustle. Will book again.",5,2017,04,30
211,Nice surprise,"Very nice welcome at the reception, nice room, good smelling and positive service and attitude. Very good price for value. It worths to come back and to consider to attend a match at the Irish sports stadium just on front of the entrance",4,2017,04,29
211,Ireland Tour,"During a self driving tour of Ireland, we had the pleasure to say at the Croke Park Hotel.  Very nice and clean rooms.  The entire staff was very friendly and helpful.  The breakfast buffet was outstanding.  Peter O´Curry, the bar manager, was particularly helpful.  Peter arranged cabs for us and was always willing to help in anyway he could.  Thanks Peter!  When we return we will stay at the Croke Park.",5,2017,04,28
211,Perfect last night in Ireland,"I chose this hotel to be close to the airport so that our exit the next day would be easy. It was a breeze.

But The Croke Park exceeded my expectations. Our room (4 people) was spacious and modern. The bathroom was one of the best I've ever stayed in -- in terms of layout and amenities. The bath towels were enormous! And there were 4 of every towel -- matching our booking.

We enjoyed a beer in their sports bar showing a big European football match on a huge screen. Breakfast was included -- and it was closer to the nice hotel buffets which usually are so expensive than the ""breakfast included"" fare that you often get in the U.S.

The  hotel has its own garage with free parking.

In short -- it was a perfect last resting spot. Thank you, Croke Park!",5,2017,04,28
211,Excellent Hotel,Our experience in this hotel was excellent for Check in to Departure. Staff could not do enough for us. Room was so comfortable. Access to the executive lounge was well worth the extra for deluxe room . I would highly recommend it,5,2017,04,27
211,"Great hotel, just outside the city centre","Just stayed here for two night. Overall impression, wonderful. Upon arrival we were given warm towels. 

The staff has been friendly and very helpful. The rooms are clean, no complaints. Beds are comfy.  There was more than enough room for 3 people.  The room had complimentary coffee or tea for you to make. WiFi is strong, had no issues. The Irish breakfast had a good selection. 

We had dinner at the hotel the first night as we were too tired to go into the city. The food was really good. I would recommend eating here.

Even though the hotel is just outside city centre, it's only about a 15 min walk. Or a quick taxi ride. Once in the city its easy to get around. 

We booked a hop on hop off with the concierge at the hotel and a nice bonus is that they have a shuttle bus to the first pick up.  So you don't have to figure out how to get there.

I have no complaints. Everyone we talked to at the hotel has been really nice and helpful, giving good advice and help tips for getting around Dublin. 

I would only recommend if you are leaving the hotel for a night or two and planning on coming back, ask ahead if u can leave your luggage. They don't have much space to hold many luggage.",5,2017,04,27
211,Fabulous Easter Family Break,"Our first time to stay here and it lived up to its rave trip advisor reviews. All the staff so friendly and nothing was a problem. I was blow-drying my hair one morning when it stopped working. We were heading out on a tour so time was precious. I rang reception and I had a replacement one in less than 5 minutes!

Family room clean and spacious, beds so comfortable.

Breakfast was a lovely, relaxed affair and food delicious. It can be stressful at times travelling with young children but our stay here was definitely the opposite. Our 2 children are badgering us to return!
 
A big thank you to all the staff, you are a credit to the Doyle group. Our only place to stay on future trips to Dublin.

I hope you won in the water polo Jennifer!
",5,2017,04,26
211,One of my favourite hotels in Ireland ,Stayed here a couple of times because of its proximity to Temple Street Hospital. The staff are great and the reception staff are extra friendly. The lovely lady who checked us in gave my daughter a lovely activity pack which kept her occupied in hospital the next day. The rooms are immaculate. The cleanest I have seen in a hotel. The bar food is amazing and very responsibly priced. Highly recommend this hotel.  ,5,2017,04,25
211,Family trip to Croke Park,"I recently stayed at Croke Park Hotel with my 3 young children for a Easter break, the service received from all staff for excellent.  The Hotel is a great location to Croke Park and the hotel deal included a tour of Croke Park and the Museum.  My 3 boys enjoyed the tour which was a highlight of the break.  The Hotel's Bistro food and breakfast was lovely all fresh food and lovely service.  I would highly recommend staying in the Hotel for a family.",5,2017,04,24
211,Very Nice and Comfortable Hotel,"It was really nice there. Rooms are clean, internet and TV is working well. Really nice restaurant. Also very helpful and nice stuff in the BAR.  I would consider to stay again in case visiting Dublin.",4,2017,04,24
211,Great Accomodations and location,"Easy to access from the airport bus, and easy to get to the hop on/hop off bus that goes around Dublin. After 24 hours of travel, I arrived in Dublin at 8am, didn't expect a room to be ready, but it was, which was great to freshen up before heading out to explore the city. The female staff at the front desk are friendly and helpful. The fitness center is great, had free weights and a cable machine as well as the usual treadmills. The restaurant has delicious food, but they are odd about packaging it up and won't give you the sauces with the main dish. The full Irish breakfast is great!",4,2017,04,24
211,Honeymoon to Dublin ,"Me and my husband stayed here for our honeymoon from 18th -21st April 2017. We arrived at Croke park hotel very early about 8.30am. We rang ahead to let them know we would be arriving early because of our flight times. We was expecting only to be able to leave our bags because of the time but luckily they had a room ready for us. The rooms was really spacious with complimentary toiletries in the bathroom which had a bath and very big shower. The room was spotless. 

There was an executive lounge on our floor but we didn't know we had use of that until half way through our visit (after we asked out of curiosity) as this wasn't explained to us when we arrived. Although we didn't use this for our full stay it was very pleasant with free orange juice, apple juice, water and hot drinks. Also a free continental breakfast in the mornings. 

The food in the bistro was amazing. The only down side was that out of 7 starters 4 of them are fish. Also on our second night stay the food took over an hour to come out to us, but this was compensated with free drinks and starters knocked off our bill. 

They do the best strawberry daiquiris Iv ever had, they was amazing! And the settees in the bar are so comfy! 

All the staff are so helpful and friendly everyone couldn't do enough to help you. 

Our room was serviced everyday with fresh towels, water and extra toiletries if needed. Also a nice little touch was chocolate on our pillow with a poem.

It is a bit of a walk to the city centre but it wasn't too bad we walked every morning and if you didn't want to taxis wasn't that expensive.

Also if you don't have a credit card (only debit) you cannot open up a tab, I think this is also why we couldn't access our mini bar and I'm assuming we wouldn't have been able to use room service either (unless we went down and paid beforehand) which was a little annoying as most hotels let you leave debit card details and then pay your bill when you leave.

Overall a good stay and would return again.

Thank you for a lovely stay in Dublin 
:)",4,2017,04,23
211,Excellent for small families,"Very good standard in price like that. Friendly and helpful personel, big parking and good restaurant. Internet connect very good most of time. DoDublin bus stop on the front of the hotel what is best first step to explore that nice town(adults 19Euro-24h, kids free).",5,2017,04,23
211,Stag do geoup,I've been on many stag do's and a lot of hotels get funny about them which can be understandable. Croak park couldn't have been better they were absolutely brilliant and all 18 of us had a really good stay.  Recommend this place for anyone as the rooms are very nice and staff are helpful. ,5,2017,04,23
211,Gorgeous Hotel!,"A few points to mention here (all good!) so best to do it in sections:

Location - bang opposite the stadium. Just round the corner from a Spar for any hotel room snacks and drinks you might like. It doesn't actually sell lager though so if you don't want wine, theres also an offlicence a further 100 meters or so further on from the shop. The hotel is around 15 minutes walking to O'Connell Street which was ideal for us  , ideal location for lots of bars and restaurants but still avoiding the noise. Quite a bit further to Temple Bar though so if you're planning on walking i'd leave your heels at home!

Staff - all the staff were lovely but a special mention to the lovely male concierge who helped us several times, with his extensive knowledge of the city. Always happy to help, whether it be to look after your cases until your room is ready, point you in the direction of where you need to be, and even offer suggestions of trips and things you may enjoy. What a lovely gent - thank you for all your help!

Hotel - lovely hotel, very clean and good value for money. Especially liked that the fridge in the room was empty so you could put your own stuff in it, without worrying of additional charges because you've accidentally moved a can of Coke! Lots of high end bath products as well which smelt lovely. Air con worked really well. Only slight niggle was that the walls were very thin so often woken up by people in the adjacent rooms or walking past the door - but quite a minor point. Free car parking for anyone who has one as well, which saves a fortune.

Hotel Bar - we only had some lunch here but it was nice. I ordered a Nicoise salad with a side of chicken and they never actually brought the chicken. That said, I didn't chase it up because the food was enough as it was, and had I mentioned it im sure they'd have rectified it quickly. I suspect the waitress didn't hear me as it wasn't on the bill either - no real biggie at all! Husband had a toastie and chips which were also very nice. In the evening we came back down for a few drinks and the atmosphere there was good. They have a lovely fireplace at one end and it was lovely to sit by it and have a nightcap. The whole bar was pretty plush with lovely big arm chairs as well.

If we ever return to Dublin I suspect we wouldn't even look at booking elsewhere, and just go straight here, as we really did enjoy our stay at The Croke Park.",5,2017,04,23
211,The Most Family Friendly Hotel We’ve Stayed In,"We have stayed in this hotel a few times with our family. It has to be the most family friendly hotel to stay in. The quality of this hotel never varies; the staff are friendly yet professional and meet everyone’s needs, especially those of the younger members of our party.",5,2017,04,23
211,This is the place to stay!!!!,The rooms are amazing and clean. Well maintained and staff in this place goes above and beyond. Each night Thomaz greeted us from behind the desk...asked about our day and made suggestions on our likes to other places.Felt like you were coming home to a smile. I would go out of my way to stay here again if I return to Dublin!! Right across from Avivo Stadium. Cheap cab ride to city center and tours. Close to airport also. Security is great. Need room card to go up in elevator.,5,2017,04,22
211,Generally very good but a couple of problems,"We were on a 2 city tour of Ireland and had 5 nights here in Dublin. It's fairly close to the airport, and right opposite the Croke Park stadium. Check-in is a breeze, you park outside, check in, and get a carpark ticket and lift card for their underground carpark which is free for residents. 

The city centre is a reasonably short 15-20 minute walk to many of the local attractions and the O'Connel shopping street.

Our room was quite roomy and comfortable with a large shower, a bath, a tv, and was very clean and well presented. The bed was huge and also very comfortable. My own slight gripe with the bed was that the thin duvet didn't pull up to the pillows, so you needed to pull the pillows down a bit to keep warm. There is a mini bar-cum-fridge but we couldn't work out how to open it to store our purchased drinks to keep them chilled.

The bar food was generally very good, with some problems that I'll come to in a minute, however it was quite expensive. The portions were a good size, too big for us with small appetites. The bar is open until quite late, often well after midnight and there is Sky tv to watch. The bar area is quite large with comfortable and spacious seating.

There is a problem with the drains near the bar area which we pointed out to staff, but nothing got done about it. The smell was quite unbearable at times.

My partner had the piri piri chicken twice, the first time was excellent, the second time it had to be sent back as it was not properly cooked. The chicken was still pink on the bone, and when it came back with a fresh replacement we were told the chef said it was cooked. It wasn't, and my partner suffered from food poisoning quite badly. This was mentioned to the manager, who eventually refunded that meal. 

I had the pork chop on the first night, and it was delicious. Another night I had the lamb hotpot, which I didn't like at all. The potatoes were too salty and the lamb too strong tasting. We were given complimentary drinks as compensation. 

Drinks at the bar are quite expensive, but table service is provided. Once the bar is closed, drinks are available by ordering from reception and drinking either in the lobby area or your room.",4,2017,04,22
211,Nice Hotel Near the Croke Park Stadium,"Stayed here at the beginning of the month while touring Dublin. The hotel is located directly across from the Croke Park Stadium. The hotel is nice but is a bit outside of the town center. It is only about a 20 minute walk to get the Temple Bar area, so if you like to walk like we do, it's no problem. There is a concierge that can help you arrange your plans for the day if need be. The bar is huge and easily accessible. We included breakfast with our room and that was great; there is an awesome selection of continental items and hot items. There is also gym on the premises. I would likely stay closer to the city center on a subsequent visit, but the Croke Park Hotel is nice.",4,2017,04,22
211,Very Nice Hotel,"We stayed 4 nights and thought the hotel and the room comfortable and pleasant.
All the staff we came into contact with were very pleasant, efficient and helpful.
The room was a good size and clean. We booked a twin, and our room had a standard double bed and a single bed.
We mainly eat out, but we did have dinner on the last evening and the service and food were good. We can recommend the seafood chowder and the lamb hotpot, both served with nice bread. 
All in all a pleasant stay",5,2017,04,22
211,Mid term break,Excellent staff and service most helpful child friendly. Food was excellent would definitely go again and no hesitation recommending to a friend. Not far from o connell street and easy to get to from the N7.,5,2017,04,21
211,Excellent stay at The Croke Park Hotel,"We had a an excellent 3 night stay in The Croke Park Hotel! I honestly cannot find fault with any aspect of our stay. All of the staff were lovely and helpful and answered all of questions! The hotel is immaculate and the room was clean and bright! The room facilities were Excellent - The bathroom was great and well equipped, the bed was comfortable and the decor was fairly modern. The food is the Sideline bar and bistro was delicious and fairly priced as well.

I wouldn't hesitate to stay here again in the future! 

Thank you to all of the staff at The Croke Park for making our stay a great one! ",5,2017,04,21
211,In the shadow of the stadium!,"This hotel was just OK.  close to airport. Very hard to find as it is literally in the lee of the big Stadium. It's a small hotel.  Awkward elevators.  Weird smell in the halls, like a gym locker.  Breakfast was plentiful but but not tasty and $10 each person. Room small but very clean.  Pick your priorities.  I would not go back.  ",3,2017,04,21
211,Excellent Experience,"The Croke Park was a great choice for our Dublin stay. Our accommodations included access to the Executive Lounge, providing fresh fruit, tea, juices, etc. all day and continental breakfast in the morning. We also received drink vouchers for each night of our day. 
Especially appealing was the firm, king-size bed--I slept so well--and the large bathroom (hot shower with good pressure).

Yes, the hotel is not in the City Center, but the walk felt good and our nights peaceful (without construction noises).

We'll come again.",5,2017,04,20
211,They Were a Wonderful Way to Finish Our Trip to Ireland. ,"After a long drive in from Clare, where our GPS took us through the city center, it was a real joy to arrive at this wonderful hotel! The staff were helpful from the beginning. They helped us celebrate our wedding anniversary, and we felt pampered by the whole experience. We were still close enough to walk to the city center for restaurants and tours, and the staff quickly called up taxis whenever we needed one. The bed was big and comfortable. The turn-down service (with chocolates and poems from Ireland's great poets) was an extra special treat. We plan on staying again when we return to Ireland. ",5,2017,04,20
211,It's like they stuff the pillows with clouds!,"We were very impressed on arrival. You need to park in the underground car park and reception validate resident tickets so you don't have to pay. Smooth check in, spacious room and the most comfortable pillows I've ever had in a hotel. Everything was spotlessly clean and the staff were professional, polite, helpful and friendly. We found the hotel food to be of good quality and top end of reasonably priced. We had no
complaints or gripes whatsoever and found the location to be an easy comfortable 15 minute walk into the city centre. Ok - the surrounding area isn't perfect but that is true of any city centre and we felt perfectly safe walking home in the small hours. The security on the door for late arrivals home was very reassuring and they check who you are before letting you in. And only residents have keys to access the upper floors via the lifts. We will definitely stay here again. Thank you for a lovely stay. ",5,2017,04,20
211,Great stay,Went to The Cooke Park for a short break. We were really pleased with the hotel- friendly staff and clean tidy rooms. We actually arrived a day early but there was no problem getting our reservation moved forward one day. Great location also! Would definitely return.,5,2017,04,20
211,Modern hotel with great staff.,"Rooms are comfortable. We had executive lounge access included, which had a free continental breakfast each morning. Fast WiFi. Approximately 15 min walk to city centre. Nothing much in the immediate area, apart from the stadium and a nice Italian restaurant. Would have no doubts about visiting this hotel again.",5,2017,04,19
211,"Clean, modern, friendly w great food","Ok so there are pros and cons here. Mostly pros. 

It's about a 15 minute walk from central Dublin. Safe area and long but pleasant walk. The green Hop On bus comes straight to the hotel but plan for an early start and end. 

You can walk to the Belvedere for their Traditional Irish Night-- book in advance. 

Large well priced rooms with free biscuits tea and coffee. Lovely staff. Great restaurant downstairs-- seriously good food. Lovely scone tea. The concierge was too busy and not terribly interested. The downstairs business computers work at lightning speed. Nice bar. Vast fireplace. Spotless. Irish only in hospitality-- this is not one of your charming little Irish hotels around Ballsbridge. If you care about modern cons and good food and attentive service at fair rates this is a great choice. 

Yes it's right on top of the Croke stadium-- or vica versa. ",4,2017,04,18
211,Great Hotel,"This was great hotel, 20 min walk to main shopping in Dublin. $10 euro cab ride. Easy to find...Good restaurant. Clean, friendly staff. I'd stay again..Good for families. 10 min drive to Guinness storehouse ",5,2017,04,18
211,one night only for st pattys day,"decent hotel for one night, came here for st pattys day. was super packed because of the rugby and football games across the street. super helpful front desk getting us an early check in because we were exhausted. security guy was kind of  a jerk. overall good spot to stay. close to city center and guiness factry",5,2017,04,18
211,Very nice hotel ,"This hotel and staff was so good to us.  The level of service received from the staff was excellent. The restaurant and all other amenities were wonderful. Close to the temple bar, great location for all attractions. 
Thanks again.

",5,2017,04,17
211,Recommend,"Staff was very friendly and room was clean and comfortable. Great location, 15-20 minute walk to city center and Connolly train station. Right across the street from Croke Park stadium. Continental breakfast was very good, wide selection. Only complaint would be very slow service in the bar area",5,2017,04,16
211,Not too Far from the Action,"Across from Croke Park.  It is a 10 minute walk from O'Connell street.  You could be at Trinity college in 20.  Much less by taxi.  The hotel is modern and rooms are spacious.  Great if you need to get to Dublin Airport as it is maybe 12 to 15 minutes by car.

The only downside is that there are about two streets that are a bit dodgy as you are walking to the main tourist strip.  Not an issue during the day but maybe at 10 or 11pm.  Calling a cab is not an issue.",4,2017,04,16
211,Excellent Hotel,"We stayed at the Croke Park for three nights and we enjoyed it thoroughly. The staff is very welcoming and knowledgeable. 
We had a problem with the shower one evening and they handled it with such aplomb and efficiency that we felt compelled to applaud their kindness and professionalism. 
All of the concierge gentlemen are assets and each provided us with details about where to go and how to navigate the city. Sean was exceedingly helpful and recommended major points of interest. 
The breakfast was excellent and the dining room staff is excellent. 
We heartily recommend the Croke Park to everyone👍
King 327/338",5,2017,04,16
211,"Modern, Clean, and Accommodating ","I recently traveled here with my Mother and three boys. We booked two rooms, one with a cot. The rooms were clean, turned down every day, and every amenity was considered even a hair dryer in the drawer. 

Housekeeping cleaned what we requested and made our beds every morning turning them down each night. The tub was perfect for soaking after long days of walking. The front desk staff was extremely helpful and accommodating doing whatever we asked, as well as the concierge who booked us a tour. 

The bistro was perfect for a delicious easy meal. Recommended- seafood chowder, squash risotto, and organic salmon with micro greens salad. Chicken goujohns were perfect for picky kids. 

While the hotel is not centralized in town opting instead for a location across from the sports stadium, if you're ok with a five minute cab ride, or 10-20 minute walk( depending where you are going), then the everything else done do well far outweighs that small inconvenience. Concierge will happily arrange your cabs. ",5,2017,04,15
211,Wonderful Stay,"I Visited the Croke Park hotel as I was working in Dublin on these 2 days and it was a good location. 

The room was amazing with nice views of the city and a good size bathroom. Beds are comfy but the pillows took a while to get used to. (Just my personal likes/dislikes) 

We had access to an executive Lounge which was ideal for a pre 7am breakfast on the day I needed it. 

The staff are wonderful and very friendly both on the ground and on the phone while I was making the booking. 

Overall it was a perfect stay and I would recommend it highly if you are looking for a good business hotel in Dublin. 

5 stars without doubt!",5,2017,04,15
211,a very pleasant experience,as always had a great stay geat atmosphere and even though it was extremely busy it was great room fab a very quite which was our main priority great nights sleep and great buzz around the place nothing was too much trouble and a guaranteed great breakfast as always ,5,2017,04,14
211,A good place to stay,"The hotel is nice and clean. It is slightly remote but the centre of Dublin is just a half an hour walk. The breakfast is very good with loads of selection. We dined in their restaurant as well, which is reasonably priced and they serve a good portion.
The only downside was that the Reception couldn't book our transport properly.

I recommend the hotel. Go through their website as you may get a better deal!",5,2017,04,14
211,Amazing! ,"Me and my partner recently stayed here for our 3 year anniversary, the rooms are well kept and the staff are so friendly and go out of their way to make your visit enjoyable. Not far from the city centre at all. really recommend this hotel to anyone looking for a relaxing weekend away.  ",5,2017,04,13
211,"Great hotel, average location ","This is a lovely hotel. The rooms are very spacious and modern with a good range of toiletries provided etc, impeccably clean. The breakfast buffet has a wide range of food,  even the continental has a lot of choice! 

The downside is the location. The hotel is in the middle of a slightly dodgy looking area (not the sort you'd want to be walking around alone at night) next to the stadium. Convenient if you're going to an event there but otherwise not. The hotel is a short walk from a local bus service into town (about a 15 min ride into the centre) so there are a lot of bus trips to different locations.  We bought a 'leap' 3 day bus travel card which paid for itself within the first day. ",4,2017,04,13
211,Excellent Friendly Hotel,"We stayed at the Croke Park as a family of 3 and stayed for two nights in a superior room 1 double and 1 single with breakfast.  
On arrival we found the reception staff very friendly and accommodating and after a long days travelling decided to eat in the hotel on the first night.  The food served was very good and not expensive and of course the Guinness went down a treat! 
The rooms are spacious and clean with complimentary tea and coffee facilities.
The hotel is about a 15 minute walk from the start of the city centre about 25 minutes from the Temple Bar area.  We chose to walk but there appeared to be buses and taxis available.
All in all a great hotel and a good base to explore the city.",5,2017,04,13
211,"Friendly, Accommodating Staff","The hotel facility is modern and clean. The staff truly went above and beyond. We arrived on an early-morning flight; even though check-in time isn't until 2 p.m., the concierge went out of his way to ensure we had a room earlier. 

This is not the most centrally located hotel, but it's in a relatively quiet neighborhood with the exception of the occasional train passing by during the day. This hotel is directly across the street from a soccer stadium-- but we don't know what it's like on game days.

Dining options are few and far between, but it's an easy walk or bus ride to the city center.",5,2017,04,12
211,City Break Hotel,"This is a good Quality hotel,a short walking distance ,around 15mins,from Dublin City Centre. It faces the Giant  Croke Park Stadium which is a good landmark to use when trying to find hotel on foot. B&B on average is €70 Euros a night. Rooms are well appointed with all mod cons,tea,coffee making etc. Breakfast is a joy,with every breakfast item available your heart could desire,all served buffet style. I didn't eat there in the evenings but menu looked wide and varied without being too expensive. Reception and concierge services are excellent. Friendly staff will promptly arrange a taxi to anywhere you wish to go. A good hotel with great location for Dublin sightseeing.",4,2017,04,12
211,Dublin Zoo package,"Stayed on Monday night, Zoo package for 2 adults and 2 kids great value. Checked in early to collect our Zoo tickets and store our bags but to our delight our room was ready so we could relax for a while. 3 course dinner included which was delicious and plenty of choice. Kids were treated really well by the staff, given a easter goody bag which they were delighted with. Only small criticisim was the pillows were uncomfortable. Other than that was a great stay and I would thoroughly recommend to anyone. Lots of personal touches too if its a special occassion.",4,2017,04,12
211,Communicating Changes Is Important,"Stayed with my wife in the Croke Park Hotel 31st March - 2nd April, it is our third time using the hotel and as you can see from previous reviews our experience has been nothing less than 5 star. Unfortunately our experience on this visit was not as positive which could have been avoided with some communication from the hotel prior to our arrival.
Having booked the hotel as part of a Christmas present as we were attending the Nathan Carter 3 Arena concert on 1st April, we had confirmation that we had been booked into our requested accommodation Queen Superior. To our surprise after the usual efficient and friendly check in, when we entered our room we found that we had been allocated a twin double. Whilst the room was adequate and again had the usual high standard of cleanliness, this was a disappointment as we had no need for two double beds. Having not been told that we were not being allocated what we had paid did put a damper on the weekend.

As it was late, we decided not to raise the issue at that time and leave to the following morning and we went for something to eat in the bar. Again food of a very high standard but service was disappointing as after a 15 minute wait I had to ask about our ordered desserts both apple crumble and custard. These duly arrived with apologies from the staff member but this showed a drop in standards of service which I would not normally expect from this hotel. Whilst the dessert was delicious, could I comment on the runny custard, - what about good old fashioned thick custard that many people prefer.

The next morning we raised the issue of the room allocation and the receptionist was very professional in asking the duty manager to talk to us. He was extremely apologetic and offered us a king size room but as we were checking out on Sunday morning we said there was no need, that our complaint was due more about the lack of communication as the room was fine for our length of stay. This was duly acknowledged by the manager which showed recognition of our comments.

One final point, disappointing that in the room we had to pay for bottles of water whilst we were offered free water on our departure (was very welcome). Many hotels of this standard have free bottle of water as standard in the rooms.

All in all the experience would not stop us coming back to the hotel which both of us feel offers good value for money, friendly staff and is well located for walking into the center of Dublin. Hopefully management will take on board the issue of communications to visitors when it is clear to the hotel that what has been booked is not available on arrival.",4,2017,04,12
211,A great hotel but a bit far from the city,"I really liked this hotel, the king size bed was so comfortable however the pillows were way too flat for me. The room was a great size and the bathroom is huge with a lovely bath and separate shower. We ordered fish and chips by room service and it arrived very quickly and was delicious. The only downside was it was too far to walk into the city so we had to catch taxis there and back but if thats not a bother i would highly recommend staying here.
",5,2017,04,11
211,Fantastic service,"Although it is a bit out of the centre, about 20 mins walk, this is a fabulous hotel. The staff were extremely welcoming and managed to get us into our rooms early and greeted us with hot towels. The rooms were lovely and clean and the bed is one of the comfiest we've ever slept in. There is a link bus to the city tour bus that stops just outside the hotel and is a great way to see the city. The staff made sandwuches for us in the early hours after a night out and were very helpful in booking taxis. We will defenitely stay here again and highly recomnend it.",4,2017,04,11
211,Great Hotel ,"Stayed here for the weekend and the service is fantastic. Free parking if u stay in hotel. Very welcoming for children. Rooms r big and spacious and very clean which is expected. Will be staying here again next time in dublin. Staff go out of there way to assist you with any problems u might have, but you won't have any problems. ",5,2017,04,11
211,Fantastic amenities and service ,"The Croke Park hotel is a lovely hotel in Dublin across the street from Croke Park. If you are in town for a match or game, this is the perfect location. As we were not in town for a game, but there was one going on across the street, it made for a crowded experience. But I have to say, the staff handled the crowds very well! Our parking was guaranteed, our room ready early, and the hotel grounds were very clean despite all the foot traffic. We loved the hotel, the Irish breakfast in the morning, turn down service and the fantastic amenities. It was a perfect stay. The only ""negative"" (if it can be called that) was the location. It's a bit away from central downtown, which wasn't really a ""negative"" for us because we didn't mind the 20 minute walk. But it could be uncomfortable for those who don't want to walk a mile in to town. 

We will definitely stay here again!! ",5,2017,04,11
211,Exceptional service and friendliness,Customer service is definitely key here. All staff without exception were friendly courteous and helpful. We had to change our booking 3 times but they responded quickly each time and gave helpful advice regarding travel from the airport and. The hotel was very busy due to games at Croke Park stadium but they coped brilliantly. They took the time to email us to let us know it would be busy and to prebook a table for dinner. We were upgraded to a deluxe room with lounge access which was very welcome. The concierge team were knowledgable and helpful advising on city tours and pubs and restaurants in the neighbourhood. Thank you for a super weekend break in Dublin.,5,2017,04,11
211,Great Stay,"Lovely hotel with fabulous staff, located across the street from the Croke Park Stadium. During my stay there was an event at the stadium and the hotel was packed with people, but I never noticed any unacceptable noise, which is to the hotel's credit. The rooms are large, modern and very comfortable. The bedding is feather (down) but they quickly provide you with man made fiber pillows and duvet once informed of necessity. Everything was pristine and the bathroom amenities provided were of good quality. I was informed by several people that the area where the hotel is located can be quite seedy at night and possibly dangerous, so I always walked in a group after dark, but I encountered no problems and witnessed nothing of the sort. I walked to and from the center of Dublin and would say it took 20-30 minutes depending on pace set. It was an easy walk with no hills and, in temperate weather, quite enjoyable. The breakfast buffet starts at 630am and has a wide variety of delicious offerings, including eggs, meats, fruits, yogurts, and cereals. The entire staff was friendly and accommodating and I thoroughly enjoyed my two night stay. While the location was not ideal for me as I would prefer a hotel a bit closer to town for sightseeing, I certainly recommend giving Croke Park a try, especially if you are attending an event at the stadium. The hotel itself and the wonderful employees will not disappoint.",5,2017,04,10
211,Amazing hotel ,"Went of a family holiday and didn't know what to expect, can say it exceeded my expectation. Amazing and friendly staff, can't do
Anything more for you.

Clean room and very comfy beds, situated locally so not long from city centre, great night life and atmosphere when there are matches on. 

Great dining facilities and great sports venues, defiantly recommend and will be back again to visit the wonderful Dublin. Thanks again for your help, assistance and genuine kindness of all the staff, public of giving recommendations. ",5,2017,04,10
211,1 night Business Trip,"On arrival parked car after a little confused with arrow markings to know what way to go.  Car parking free for guests. You need to get your parking ticket authorised at reception when you leave. 

Receptionist was very pleasant and checking painless. 

General decorator pleasant.  Rooms spacious and well equipped. Bathrooms had walk-in shower and separate bath which is great.  

Kettle in room for drinks.  Tv and a hifi in room. Safe and extra pillows provided. Fridge which is the mini bar with nothing in it. Trouser press, ironing board and iron in room. Plenty of hangers and space for shoes etc. 

Beds comfortable.  Breakfast (room service) was hot and on time. €5 tray charge. Pleasant stay and would recommend the hotel. 
",4,2017,04,10
211,Nice Modern Hotel,"The hotel itself is located directly across the GAA (rugby) stadium and within a seemingly seedy neighborhood( as we were told by numerous taxi cab drivers).  Nevertheless, we felt safe walking to/from the city center at night.  The hotel is clean, modern, with a great breakfast buffet. About 15 minute drive to the airport.",4,2017,04,10
211,Very good stay,"We are a family of 4, 2 kids and 2 adults. We stayed in a family room which had 2 double beds. The room was spacious, not huge but adequate. The bathroom was large and had a bath which the kids loved. Staff were really helpful and every time they saw us in the hallways they greeted us. The location is perfect if you are planning on seeing a match at the Croke Park stadium. It takes about 15 mins to walk to the city centre. If you are elderly or have knee problems then it's definitely too far for you to walk.",4,2017,04,09
211,Fine hotel,Stayed only for one night as I was going to a gig in the three Arena. Room was spacious and clean. Staff were friendly and accommodating.  Hotel had on site car parking underground. Only had breakfast there snd it was fine. Buffet breakfast usual assortment of hot and cold food. Price was resonable. Hope to go back here again for a longer stay next time.,5,2017,04,07
211,Outstanding Family Hotel,"Spent a night here with my wife and two young children this week on the Dublin Zoo package.
From start to finish, our experience was positive, from welcoming reception staff to clean, modern, comfortable accommodation, we could honestly fault no part of our stay. The food was excellent and the kids' menu in particular was really well thought out. Secure on-site free parking was very handy with small kids also and to top off our stay, free bottled water as we left was a really handy touch ahead of a long car journey, it's the little things that stick in the mind!

Hope to be back soon.",5,2017,04,05
211,Great Hotel with amazing staff!,"We were celebrating our Emerald anniversary so instead of a boring emerald we decided on the Emerald Isle!!  Croke Park hotel was a bonus, the reception staff very welcoming. Lovely airy room with 2 double beds and really nice bed linen. Bathroom with bath and separate shower and lovely fluffy towels. The Sideline Bistro served good food and waiting and bar staff really friendly. Will definitely come again.",5,2017,04,05
211,Exceptional hotel and excellent service,"on arrival receptionists were very polite and friendly they even sang happy birthday to my nine year old daughter then set a lovely chocolate cake to her room
WHICH MADE HER DAY !!!!!!
overall highly recommended ",5,2017,04,03
211,Excellent Hotel ,"This is the second time we've stayed here and it didn't disappoint! Excellent staff, great rooms and super convenient location.  We stayed in a deluxe room which included free wifi, breakfast and snack room, and free pint every night!",5,2017,04,03
211,"Clean hotel, nice gym and friendly staff!","This was our first stay in Dublin. A bit hard to get to due to traffic and we chose to leave the car there (parking on site) and walk everywhere. We enjoyed the gym, the Sideline Bar, and had access to a continental breakfast, and access to snacks and drinks whenever we desired due to 4th floor stay. Loved the turn down service in the evening with nice touches such as chocolate treats and slippers placed out for us. The bar manager Peter O'Curry was amazing! great place to stay, but a bit on the outskirts of Dublin.",4,2017,04,01
211,Early ferry back to Holyhead,"Booked as it is conveniently located to get to the port for an early ferry however don't be fooled that it will only take the 8 or 9 mins sat nav said, it might have been a one off but it took about 25 mins to get to the port due to the traffic but I think that would have been the same from which ever direction you came from. On a plus point Breakfast starts early so it gives you plenty of time. 

I was really impressed with the hotel & staff, although it felt I aged 2 years waiting for my first pint of Guinness, the wait however was worth it.   

Rooms were very clean & well equipped with a nice desk area to work on, good internet connection. 

The food in the restaurant was excellent and reasonably priced with a good choice however the bar meal I had on the first night was not that impressive and maybe overpriced for what it was, might just have been a bad choice. 

Breakfast, buffet style, very good selection & eat as much as you want but remember you might be getting on a ferry an hour later, 

Overall I'd recommend the hotel and will stop there on my next visit, 

OK, it's not in the city center but the Temple Bar area is only a 10 min taxi away,",5,2017,03,30
211,Amazing Hotel,"Fantastic hotel.  Staff are really freindly, food is lovely, atmosphere is great. I stayed when there was a few games on over at the stadium.  The place was packed just before the start of the game, but the hotel continued to give the same high standard of service despite there being a couple of hundred people in the bar!!

Rooms are really comfortable and just right for a business trip or short break.",5,2017,03,30
211,Brilliant customer service and staff ,"Late review! We came here for two nights in February for my birthday. Place was spotlessly clean and although a distance from the city centre, only 20 minute walk. Taxis ordered for us if needed and arrived quickly. Ian the manager looked after us- checked us in early and welcomed with hot flannels after a cold walk and flight from England. Even received a birthday card and bubbly! Would recommend. Great value for money and good breakfast!
",5,2017,03,30
211,pfl,"Friendly staff, large rooms with nice an new furniture, very good breakfast. Wi'Fi working reliable and fast. Good position, walking distance to Temple bar about 30 min, taxi from/to the center about 10 Euro.  ",5,2017,03,30
211,Amazing hotel,I wouldn't go anywhere else I've been 3 times the rooms the staff everything to the bars and restaurants are outstanding i am going back again with my daughter sister and friend they loved it last time too I've been with my husband also it's a beautiful hotel the staff can't do enough for you the deluxe rooms are excellent in saying that all the rooms are excellent in my mind it's the best i like my comfort and you won't get better comfort than in this hotel honestly don't go anywhere else book the Croke Park Hotel it's simply the best can't wait to come back August or September this year photos inside the room in Croke Park Hotel i will be back again and again,5,2017,03,29
211,Busines3 Trip,"Excellent hotel, attentive staff, quality rooms and good food. Car parking on site below the hotel.

A bit far out of the city centre (bus or taxi required) but just across the road from Croke Park and the excellent stadium tour.",4,2017,03,29
211,Attentive staff asked me 3 time if they could help with my bags!,Lovely staff very attentive - gave me the confidence to take the 20 min walk into Dublin alone just before sunset. So glad I did. When I arrived the Receptionist asked me 3 times in 10 mins whether I wanted help with my small bag - very sweet. As previous reviews stated it was sooooo quiet so a great nights sleep (may be different when games are on at the stadium though (I was here Mon and Tues night). What would I improve - hot plates for hot food at breakfast would be the icing on the cake....,4,2017,03,28
211,Excellent hotel,"All staff were very helpful, nice and the hotel is beautiful. Perfect location with downtown only a 20 minute walk. Great hotel to stay at with a great restaurant as well. The price is really worth it",5,2017,03,28
211,Excellent,"A lovely bright, contemporary hotel.  I stayed there with my husband and four children.  They had room with two doubles, a single and a camp bed which was great, because it is difficult to get a room that's sleeps four children.  Staff were very friendly and helpful.  When we arrived we were given hot towels, which was much appreciated after long journey.  Hotel is very modern.  Room was lovely and ensuite was very well stocked for six, with everything one could need.  We had drink in bar before dinner.  We sat outside as it was a beautiful evening.  Very comfortable with lots of cusions on wicker wood furniture and side view of Croke Park.  Bar overall is very spacious, bright and airy with lots of seating and long open fire.  Dinner was enjoyed by all.  Location was perfect as we were attending match across the road in Croke Park.  We ordered a variety of sandwiches later which were very tasty and well presented even though it was quite late!  Breakfast next morning was a real treat, kids had hot chocolate and pancakes which they were delighted with.  Hot breakfast was excellent.  When we were checking out, we were given bottles of mineral water.  Great for our long journey home.",5,2017,03,28
211,Good business hotel,"First time in Ireland and my company booked this hotel for me. Very attentive stuff at the front lobby. Rooms are clean and large enough. Although, some parts of the hotel feel a little dated.
I like the executive lounge – if you want to sit down for a meeting other part of the hotel are a little bit too loud.  ",5,2017,03,27
211,Quality Stay,"Stayed here last weekend on a business function Stayed in the hotel for two nights. We had dinner in the Bar on Friday night. The menu selection was very minimal, I personally would have liked a wider choice. The food that we got was first class. The beds are comfortable, the rooms are spacious. The bathroom was spotless I couldn't fault it at all. The staff are very friendly from the first time you meet them at check in. Breakfast is a wonderful experience, It's a self serve buffet but the choice is vast and the food is always piping hot. It is on the pricey side to stay but if you like your luxury and comfort and can afford it then I would highly recommend.",5,2017,03,27
211,"Great hotel, fantastic stay!","We have just returned from a 4 night stay at The Croke Park hotel and couldn't fault a thing! All of the hotel staff were attentive and made the stay that bit more enjoyable. 
We stayed in one of the executive rooms and loved it, the bed was huge. With the executive room we were able to access the executive lounge for extra tea and coffee or even eat or fruit juice, you also get breakfast included with the executive room and this was very extensive and always very good. 
All in all, the stay was perfect, thank you to all at The Croke Park!",5,2017,03,27
211,Great hotel!!,Would highly recommend this hotel.  Close to buses and 15 minute walk to Connolly Street (main street in Dublin).  Great breakfast every morning in their restaurant.   Really nice workout facility. Rooms were very comfortable and beds comfy too!  Spacious bathroom.  Overall very clean hotel!,5,2017,03,26
211,St. Patrick's Day in Dublin,"Every staff member I interacted with during my stay at Croke Park was helpful and friendly.  I stayed over St. Patrick's Day and many hotels in the area were charging an obscene amount of money for a room; Croke Park was reasonably priced AND since I spent 3 nights, breakfast was included!  The Concierge had wonderful restaurant recommendations within walking distance, provided me with a map of Dublin, and scheduled cabs as needed.  WONDERFUL EXPERIENCE.  I plan on staying here again in the future. ",5,2017,03,25
211,Overnight in Dublin,"A nice hotel, very clean , the staff where very friendly and there is free parking underneath the hotel. It is easy to drive too and a 20-30 min walk from the city center. The breakfast was very nice and relaxed. I would definitly be considering using this hotel for my next visit.",5,2017,03,25
211,Football trip with child.,"6 adults and a child. Arrived very early and one of the rooms was ready. 

Reception staff, warm, friendly and very polite. The hot towels were a refreshing plus point.

Rooms spacious for a city and very clean. Well stocked mini bar, tea tray and bathroom. The bathroom products were white company. Towels clean and fluffy.

Beds and pillows comfy and there were extras available. 

All the staff were attentive and curious, the bar/lounge was lovely and the drinks were cheaper than in the Temple Bar area. The free nuts and snacks were an added bonus. 

About a 10 min walk to town but we enjoy walking so not an issue for us €7 in a taxi. Airport was approx €25 in a taxi or €45 for a mini bus.

Highly recommend by us all, bar food was lovely but did not have breakfast. ",5,2017,03,25
211,"Great stay, great staff","Lovely hotel located a short taxi ride from central Dublin. Staff were extremely helpful and friendly; hotel amenities v.good; rooms are spacious (for Dublin), comfortable & well appointed - Bed comfy! Hotel is a short cab ride from Dublin centre.  Would recommend and would stay again  ",5,2017,03,24
211,St Patrick's Weekend,"Stayed here for Paddy's weekend. Everything is fantastic. Rooms are big, bathroom enormous, even a separate walk in shower cubicle opposite the bathtub.

Check in and out a breeze, staff friendly and helpful, we got late drinks even when we crawled in at 3am!! Breakfast plentiful,  buffet style and of a very high standard (I'm a chef)

If there is one drawback, it's quite a way from the city centre. However, we walked it on Saturday morning and took 30-40 mins. About 10-15 Euros in a cab depending on time and size of cab. I would return in a heartbeat ",5,2017,03,23
211,Perfect stay in Dublin,"We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at The Croke Park. We were welcomed with a hot towel and very attentive staff. They even had our room ready early and so we were able to go straight up! The decor was very classic and I loved the large bathroom with beautiful The White Company products and a large shower area and bath. The Irish coffee we had on our last day was better than any of the ones we had in the centre of town. I honestly am really impressed with the level of service that we received. We had a fruit bowl that was topped up with fresh fruit everyday and it was delicious! I had booked a room with a queen bed, which I hadn't realised is smaller than a double...so two in that bed was tight but thankfully we had a single so I ended up in there. That was my mistake though nothing to do with the hotel. The breakfast was by far the best breakfast I have had anywhere! They had fresh honeycomb and all kinds of fruit, yogurt, cereal, and of course all the usuals. The staff were so helpful and attentive it was a truly super experience. Thanks to everyone for making our stay flawless!",5,2017,03,23
211,Potential for business clients,"Attended this hotel for a training conference. It's a lovely hotel, nice lobby, clean, quite and well kept, good Ambience so might try it for an overnight stay.  There is a nice secluded lobby area that you can reserve for drinks and get togethers which is well laid out and very inviting. Bathrooms and toilet areas are spotlessly clean.  Conference rooms are ok, nice size but the layout for a group of 30 wasn't great... narrow tables and we had to ask each time for cables to plug in laptops, pity..   The first day we had to ask for biscuits to go with teas and coffees, second day they were brought in but the 3rd day they were missing again.  Great potential for business clients wanting to use these facilities but staff need to keep ontop of this from a business development perspective, cable access is a priority !!!   Wifi took a while to connect but worked well when connected.   Would like to stay to check out the facilities such as bedrooms and restaurant /bar.  One day maybe.",3,2017,03,22
211,Good parts and not so good parts,"The good first - great front desk and bar/restaurant staff.  Everyone at the front was Very helpful and friendly (with one exception). Concierge was great in getting us on the tour bus and helpful with directions.  The restaurant staff was attentive - better than any other Dublin restaurants we ate at.  The bar staff were friendly and helpful.  The food and drinks were good tasting and reasonably priced.  Breakfast was wonderful. Great coffee.  I got a handicapped room, and didn't need one.  But the room was well kept and quiet.  My room had great pillows, but I heard from others that this wasn't the norm.  

The not so good - the location and the housekeeping.  There is absolutely nothing else close by this hotel.  Everything fun to do in Dublin (with the exception of the Croke Park Stadium) is at least a 20 minute walk away.  If you are coming to go to the stadium, this would be a great place to stay.  But for anything else,  be prepared to walk through an ""iffy"" part of Dublin to get to the main commercial area.  The housekeeping was awful. My in room mini bar was empty.  I asked about it and nothing was done to correct it.  My friend's baby soiled the sheets on one of the beds, while he was being changed during their visit.  I cleaned it up best I could and slept in the other bed.  The next day, the soiled sheets were still on the bed and had not been changed.  The one exception to the great front staff was a gentlemen and occurred when I was unhappy about having to get a new key for the third time.  This gent, very rudely, told me it was my fault for putting the key in my purse with my cell phone.  Where else would a woman put both of those items??  I told him that someone should have told me that they couldn't be put in close proximity to each other and he got rude with me again and slammed one of the key card envelops down on that counter and said, ""This is why we give you the envelope.""  I was getting ready to check out, so I just got my stuff and left with a bad feeling.",3,2017,03,20
211,Rugby trip,"Polite staff, clean hotel, quiet room, great facilities. Located right next door to Croake Park stadium, so very good if you are going to see a game. Good food at breakfast. There was a problem with the lift, but this was minor.",5,2017,03,20
211,Clean and comfortable,"Only downside is the decor in the room. Too much brown for my taste!
Having said that, the staff are great, the rooms are very comfortable with good bathrooms. It's not super luxury but it's very decent indeed. Would recommend for a short business stay. ",4,2017,03,17
211,Ireland 2017 vacation ," I booked this hotel due to some of he reviews but they did not do the hotel any justice! I was beyond blown away by the pleasant and helpful attitude from EVERY employee at the hotel that we came into contact with. I will recommend this hotel to anybody I know who's going to Dublin and if I ever go back, hands down we'll be staying there again.

The restaurant has awesome food, bar staff was top notch!(ask for Frane pronounced fren ay) he was awesome! 

Rooms are very big, as was the bathroom. Executive lounge was great for breakfast or to just sit and relax late at night after exploring the many pubs in town. 

Great location(15min from Dublin airport) 
5 min taxi to city center",5,2017,03,15
211,Great hotel,"Great hotel, staff very helpful, comfy bar and restaurant with huge TV mainly for watching sport. Food was very good and reasonably priced. It is a bit out of the centre, but this wasn't a problem as there is a bus not far away that goes to the centre regularly. Think you get a lot of hotel for your money here compared to other hotels in Dublin.",4,2017,03,15
211,Lovely comfortable rooms,"Staff very friendly welcoming & friendly.  This is about our 6th visit to the hotel as it, along with the Westbury, is one of our favourite hotels in Dublin.  Although not located in a very nice part of the city it is very near to city centre and the hotel itself is just lovely and comfortable.
However our recent visit was not a nice one!  We found the menu to be very limited - in fact -both nights I had the same main as there was not a lot to choose from which suited me.  My husband ordered shoulder of lamb and he got 1 slice of lamb (shredded) on the plate along with 2 baby carrots & potatoes gratin which was dried up and tasteless.  We were also shocked to discover that a glass of Prosecco cost €10!  It was not champagne, no prosecco, and not of a very high quality.

When my husband complained to the Restaurant Manager, he shrugged his shoulders & said ""that's how it is"".  He then proceeded to keep talking whilst my husband was trying to explain how poor his meal had been - eventually my husband had to remind him that he should listen to his customer.  After this, he folded his arms, said nothing (not even an apology)!  Very poor customer service on his behalf, as the waiting staff were very polite.

I know the staff don't price either food or drink, but I feel that €10 for a glass of Prosecco is outrageous - is this because the Doyle Collection have taken over management???  One would imagine, that on non-match days this hotel, because of its location should at least offer value for money in order to attract tourists.  Most foreigners there, took one drink then left.  Im sure they were flabbergasted at the poor choice of menu and the prices.

Pity, as we really enjoyed visiting but I don't think we'll be back much to our regret because it really is a lovely comfortable hotel with lovely reception staff.",5,2017,03,14
211,"2nd stay at The Croke Park, Dublin, Ireland.",My wife and I stayed at The Croke Park for the second time in March 2017. They were offering a good deal on their own website ..... two nights bed and breakfast with free secure underground parking. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay. The staff were all very courteous and helpful. The room was comfortable and clean. Likewise with the bathroom which included a bath and separate walk-in shower. The location is beside the Croke Park stadium and is about a 15 minute walk to O'Connell Street in the city centre. The hotel would have information about buses and taxis but we walked to and from. Catering in the hotel is very good. There is also a good Italian restaurant very close ( approx 100 metres ). We received free newspaper each morning to our room and free bottled water on departure. We will stay again.,5,2017,03,13
211,"Excellent stay, executive level is worth it!","It is our 3rd night here and we are loving it!

Although the hotel is a bit out in the suburbs, it is only a 15 minute walk from O'Connell street which is where all the action is. To get there is a nice quiet walk through a neighborhood. We never had any problems walking there.

The hotel is very nice, the rooms are pretty big (King Room Deluxe). I never had any issue with the cleaning staff, they were great. Room service from the Sideline bistro was also good.",5,2017,03,13
211,Absolutely lovely,"Literally everything was lovely. I stayed here as a birthday treat with my partner last year and loved it. The hotel was very clean with lovely friendly staff. Good location, this was our first time in dublin and we found our way round all within walking distance no problem. Would definitlet recommend!",5,2017,03,13
211,Lovely hotel to stay in,"Everything you would expect from a hotel, couldn't do more for us. We had an early flight to Dublin and happily checked us in before 10am. 

Breakfast was really, they will cook items not on the buffet, you only need to ask.

Perfect for my husbands early birthday present, thank you everyone.",4,2017,03,13
211,Enjoyable,"I highly recomend the Croke Park Hotel as the place to stay in Dublin.  Every aspect of the hotel to the rooms, services, dining and staff was A+++.  I plan on make the Croke Park hotel my home when I visit Dublin.      
 ",5,2017,03,13
211,Nice little touches and a couple of minor faults.,"Double Tree gives you warm cookies on arrival...The Croke Park gives you a warm towel.
This was a 3 night business trip.
Everything was as I would expect from similar category and priced hotels.
The hotel is modern clean and comfortable with spacious and comfortable rooms.The staff are friendly and efficient.
There were a couple of minor points that didn't exactly spoil the stay but were a little irritating:
1) The desks in the rooms are thoughtfully designed to incorporated a covered recessed double power outlet. Unfortunately the recess is so small that the moulded plug on my  laptop power supply wouldn't fit and I had to use my international travel adaptor as a socket extender to make the connection.
2) I wouldn't normally mention it but it happened on two separate occasions. When the waiter brought the bill for me to sign to charge food and drink to my remove they didn't provide a pen and I had to ask. Normally it's handed over in the little wallet with the bill in.
Neither are real deal breakers",5,2017,03,13
211,Best hotel stay possible ,This hotel was beyond amazing. They went above and beyond for my husband's 40th birthday. The burger was the best I've had in years. The chef makes the best wheat free cake. Everyone was so welcoming and went above and beyond to make us have the best stay. They helped us book better tours than you could on the internet. Thank you again and again and when we come back to Ireland we will be repeat customers!,5,2017,03,11
211,Not fond of Americans,"I enjoyed the location, the room was nice, well put together, food was good, if not overpriced as most hotels. Requested a wake up call at 0500 for an early morning tour, got called the day after, no apology of any kind. Was charged for a drink I did not order, staff refused to revisit the bill. I'll be glad to stay somewhere else, they charge too much for 2 star service. My money will spend just as well elsewhere. ",2,2017,03,11
211,Superb Hotel,Excellent location - especially for access to games and events at Croke Park Stadium -  very welcoming and efficient staff at check-in and check-out..   Very comfortable rooms and excellent breakfast and food. Have stayed here on a number of occasions and always look forward to going back there.      Well done to all the management and staff.,5,2017,03,10
211,"Fantastic stay, Fantastic staff, Great location","My wife and Daughter were visiting for a few days when My daughter was on work placement - the staff were excellent - and Nadia deserves special attention and mention for assisting with our requests.

100% recommended",5,2017,03,09
211,Great hotel,"My husband and I were only there for a weekend but if we ever make it back we will definitely stay here again! The staff is friendly and helpful and the breakfast buffet was delicious! 
The concierge was helpful with taxis and tours. ",5,2017,03,09
211,Excellent hotel & staff,"Absolutely great hotel , excellent service and outstanding attitude towards Kids.I would highly recommend staying at this hotel.Location is excellent but the comfort in the rooms is first class.Highly highly recommended.",5,2017,03,09
211,Excellent Food. Even Better Service!!,"My family and I went there for some dinner after it had been recommended by a friend. It was the evening and so we decided to dine in the bar rather than in the restaurant. Instantly satisfied with the layout and quality of the hotel, we were quickly seated and served. The best, most friendly and professional service that I have ever received. Dale (our waiter) was super knowledgeable about the menu and was very accommodating with any of our questions. He was really friendly and funny too and we were instantly relaxed into a great mood. Then came the food! What a treat, I had the steak and it was perfection. Cooked exactly how I wanted it and it came with a side of the creamiest mash. It was presented really well and was very appetising. Needless to say that not any of us at the table left a single morsel on our plates. Would 100% recommend this hotel for its food and bar service any day and will definitely be returning again!",5,2017,03,07
211,Long weekend stay,"Excellent hotel, friendly staff the concierge on at the weekend was so helpful. Clean and tidy rooms. Daughter used gym which was brilliant. Good links into the city easy walking distance, and the tour bus picks you up out side  ",5,2017,03,07
211,Welcome surprise,"Initially I booked this hotel as I was arriving in Dublin after a long haul flight and wanted somewhere easy to stop and recoup. I arrived early and early check in was no issues. The room was amazing, huge with a very large bed, bath and shower. The staff were very friendly and the concierge was both pleasant and helpful. Dining in was great too, with both relaxed and more formal options. I have to say the gym was great too. I've been to so many hotels advertising ""fitness facilities"" and then turn up to find on old elliptical trainer that could have dated back to 1984. The Croke park however had a great range of weights and machines. All up a great experience. Would definitely recommend! ",5,2017,03,07
211,Fantastic 4 star propery,"The rooms are big and with all the amenities that you need for a nice stay. The staff is friendly and the location is useful. Good restaurant and nice bar area. 4 stars superior hotel, well prepared for business. ",5,2017,03,03
211,A dream hotel after a nightmare...,"We stayed in Dublin for 6 nights, at 4 separate hotels. We had planned on 3 but were forced to leave one early since it was a disaster. Luckily we changed from that hotel to The Croke Park and saved the rest of the trip. Reception was incredibly friendly and efficient, the hotel was very clean and modern, the room comfortable and quiet. The only downside was that it is located a bit away from downtown but we either walked or took a taxi when needed so it wasn't too bad.",5,2017,03,03
211,Excellent hotel with great service and value for money!,"Hotel's room are big and very clean, with free 2 bottles of water every day.
Hotel's Staff were very professional and helpful on every inquiry or issue raised.
Breakfast is very good but the buffet is not changing, you basically eat the same every day, however, food quality is excellent and tasty.
Internet access was good and fast enough, and was already included in price.
Hotel's location is pretty far from city center, you will need a taxi to get into action, not many restaurants or shops are near by. it will take about 10 minutes of driving with taxi or 20-30 minutes of walking.

The Bad:
1) Hotel's location is far from city center and temple bar areas, not many shops or food restaurants near by.
2) Hotel is very busy and crowded and also noisy on weekends, when there is a game on the near by stadium.
3) Breakfast buffet is the same each day without any changes, at least one dish should be changed every day.
4) Landry and ironing services are very expensive.
5) Food variety should be changed more often.

The good:
1) Excellent professional service by hotel's staff, always smiling and trying to help. did not have any issue which was not resolved.
2) Good value for money, compare to other hotels in Dublin.
3) Rooms are big and clean,with good internet services.
4) Rooms are well equipped (Ironing equipment, strong WIFI signal, toiletries, 2 water bottles, cafe/tea and more...
5) You can ask for custom dishes on breakfast which are not part of the regular menu / buffet and also for special coffee servings.
6) Food serving and quality on side bar / bistro bar was excellent.
7) Received free access to the executive lounge.

Overall: If you dont mind the the location I would definitely recommend this hotel!",4,2017,03,03
211,Warm Welcome,"Lovely warm welcome by Hotel staff.  Check in was easy and room was warm and comfortable.  I had to make a short trip to Croke Park and staff gave me an umberella to use as it was raining.  Used the residents bar into the late hours and staff continued to be welcoming and friendly. Check out was again with the same lovely girl - she gave me a complimentary bottle of water which was most welcome.  I would definitely recommend this hotel.  It is in a great location.  
I did think 20 Euro was expensive for breakfast but this seems to be the normal price in Hotels now.",5,2017,02,27
211,Perfect getaway location,"I spent 6 consecutive months at this hotel for work, I would return again in a heartbeat. Staff were excellent, very polite, friendly and helpfull. The rooms were very well equipped and the location is great. 

The restaurant serves very good food and drink, a decent range and nice atmosphere for dining. I honestly can not fault this hotel and I would definitely recommend to anyone thinking of booking.",5,2017,02,27
211,Croke Park and CIE Tours,"This hotel has an exceptional staff.  Everyone is very professional and at the same time very friendly and kind.  We were booked for two nights with CIE Tours and then had an additional three nights booked ourselves in another hotel.  We cancelled the other hotel and remained at the Croke Park.  It is within walking distance of the main shopping areas and Temple Bar.  It is very clean, the service is friendly and professional, and it's rates were good.  It is a quieter area than the hotel we stayed in previously and has hop on/hop off service right to the door.  ",5,2017,02,25
211,Exceeded exoectation,"Highly recommend. From the moment we arrived at the car park entrance at 04:30 (Storm Doris having delayed our arrival by 12hours!) we encountered customer service of the highest quality. Very comfortable, clean room large cosy bed; our booking included access to the Executive Lounge found to be excellent bonus, full Irish breakfast I particularly enjoyed the honeycomb to have with fruits as an appetizer and a 14:00 check out so appreciated after our struggles with Doris the prevuous day. We look forward to our return visit when are staying the night before our return ferry journey home.",5,2017,02,25
211,If Carlsberg did hotel...,"If Carlsberg did hotels, it would be this one. I was so impressed with everything.... staff were brilliant.... genuinely brilliant. They even organised chips at 1am for us and said goodbye as they finished work... fantastic attitudes and very professional... a perfect balance of both.  Next is the bed... omg, I can never sleep in hotel beds but I could have stayed in the bed for days, it was that comfortable. Next the room size was vg and lighting from long windows was lovely. And that wow bathroom with the 'white' range of complimentary toiletries(love that range) and superior standard fixtures.... the only thing to get me out of the bed was that shower.... so folks, my positive rant can be summarised in 2 sentences, class fit out rooms with even classier staff, well worth a visit. My only feedback is breakfast should be included in the price...",5,2017,02,25
211,Excellent for business and for leisure,Good modern hotel very focused on quality if service. Hotel is situated on the walk-able distance from the most part of touristic attraction on the northern side of Dublin. The loyalty program seems to be unusual in a good sense and very promising (will update on it a soon as I have a chance to check it:),5,2017,02,24
211,Discover Dublin & Croke Park Hotel,"Recently, I got an email from the Croke Park Hotel advertising a new offer.We got one night stay, very very reasonable for two adults and a teenager and a choice of two adult passes for either a tour of Croke Park or the Guinness Storehouse. We have seen Croke Park but wanted to take our daughter to see Guinness Storehouse.This was an ideal opportunity.AS for Croke Park Hotel, everything was excellent, delicious food, so clean and such friendly and helpful staff.Delighted that Car Park is so close and free too.Couldnt find fault with this hotel if I tried.Highly Recommended!!!!",5,2017,02,24
211,A lovely stay ,"The hotel is well located directly across the street from the Croke Park Stadium and is about a 20 minute walk to the city centre/Temple bar district and is a 20 min drive from the airport. The hotel itself has great amenities including a library, bar and restaurant bar. The rooms are spacious and well equipped with tea and coffee making facilities and a bar fridge. The bathroom had a separate shower and bath. The staff were friendly and helpful and we thoroughly enjoyed our stay. ",5,2017,02,23
211,Amazing ,"My boyfriend and I stayed here for two nights whilst in Dublin to see a show to celebrate my boyfriends 21st. From the second we got there we were treated like royalty! 

We were in an executive room on the 4th floor. The bed was huge and super comfortable and the room had everything you could wish for in it. We were left two bottles of Prosecco and some chocolates because it was a birthday. 

The food and cleanliness of the hotel was perfect and I cannot recommend this place enough! 

Thank you Croke Park for an amazing trip!",5,2017,02,23
211,Fantastic Hotel,"We have stayed at the Croke park on numerous occasions & I can honestly say this hotel just keeps getting better, from the cleanliness of the hotel to the outstanding staff
I can honestly say I'd stay nowhere else in Dublin, keep up the excellent work & keep the hotel affordable ",5,2017,02,22
211,Stay at Croke Park Hotel Dublin,"This hotel is in a great location for visiting the city of Dublin.  We have stayed here several times and are always pleased with our experience. The rooms are comfortable and spotless.  The staff are always pleasant, helpful and welcoming.  The breakfast is excellent.",5,2017,02,22
211,Highly recommended,"We stayed a couple of nights in this hotel as we were going to a show. Let things for us on this visit were location, quality of the accommodation and cleanliness. 
The hotel is about 20 mins by cab from the airport. It cost us €20. It is then about 15 mins from the hotel to the 3arena which is where we wanted to go. It is possible to walk into the centre of Dublin and the route is fairly straightforward and takes about 15mins to the top of O'Connell St. 
The hotel is literally on the doorstep of Croke Park (clue in the name!!) where they play football and rugby games! There were games on both the Saturday and Sunday and the hotel did get very busy and noisy and the police closed the road so we couldn't get a cab for a little while. It didn't bother our plans too much but if you are needing to be somewhere for a specific time it may be worth bearing this in mind. 
We did go for a walk around the local area. It is not the nicest and I wouldn't recommend walking alone. There is a spar not far from the hotel if you want to pick up some snacks. 
The hotel room was a nice hotel room. It was not particularly special or different to any other hotel room. However it was clean and everything worked. If I had to complain I found the duvet was thin and appeared to have lost much of its filling. I did wonder if I would be cold but we put the heating on and we were ok. We could have asked and I am sure the hotel would have replaced it or provided additional blankets. 
In general the place was clean and we had no cause for complaint in that regard. The staff were on the whole polite and well mannered and when we asked for help they were able to point us in the right direction. 
Breakfast was included in our stay. It was a buffet style and the food was plentiful  and really tasty. No complaints about that. 
We would certainly stay in this hotel again, it really was very good, the sideline bar was excellent and we were able to come and go easily. Despite it being busy there was no real issue with noise either. Highly recommended. ",4,2017,02,21
211,Good place to stay,"Recently stayed here on a weekend away with my fiancée. Very nice hotel, very nice facilities, friendly staff. Good location, ten minute walk from the Main Street, 15-20 walk from Temple Bar, 15 min taxi ride from airport (20-30 Euros). Buses available in the morning via DoDublin to ferry guests from hotel to town, would recommend this service. Room very nice, clean, light, massive bathroom, no idea why we needed one that big but was very nice nonetheless. Bed a bit soft for our taste and pillows very soft, some back and neck aches in the morning. Very nice bar and reception area, only thing to watch out for is to check the Croke park fixture list before you go. The bar is rammed packed with match goers before and after the matches. Still a really good atmosphere but can take you by surprise if you're just going down for a couple of quiet pints after a busy day! ",4,2017,02,21
211,does not disappoint!,"Our 2nd visit to the hotel in 3 years and as before a 5 star rating. Everything has been said in previous reviews....a truly fantastic hotel. It was a very busy weekend with sport on both Saturday and Sunday.....Sideline bistro very busy, so how do you get round that?....room service, delivered within 20 minutes and delicious food too......well worth the small fee for room service. If there is a slight negative.....and this is by no fault of the hotel, is the location.....after speaking to taxi drivers, not recommended to walk around after dark. But please dont let this put you off, the positives outweigh the negatives by far! Croke Park, be proud of yourself and keep up the good work!",5,2017,02,19
211,First class hotel,"This was my fifth visit to the Croke Park Hotel and it only gets better. The highlights this time have to be the friendliness of the staff both at the front desk and in the restaurant.
Our room on the 4th floor was spotless and access to the executive lounge is a great bonus. We had a lovely meal in the restaurant on the Saturday evening and appreciated the attentive staff especially Orla, who made time to chat to us even though she was very busy. Thanks especially to Sean Reid who looks after us every year.
 Maire Gallagher",5,2017,02,19
211,"Lovely hotel, friendly staff and great sleep","I stayed in this lovely hotel on business. It is right opposite the Croke Park Stadium.  I had the evening meal in a group of 70 which they catered for without any problems. The food was lovely. Soup followed by leg of lamb and a chocolate mouse. It was delicious. The bar area is great also which had 2 TV's behind the bar and 1 giant screen above a gas fire. The room had a large double bed, temperature was perfect. The bed was very comfy. had a great nights sleep. Bathroom had a big bath and a good powerful shower. 

Overall, it was a nice pleasant stay and staff was very helpful.",5,2017,02,19
211,Very welcoming,Stayed here for two days. The staff were really friendly and welcoming. The bed is the most comfortable we have ever slept in. Breakfast was really good and a vast array of choice. Highly recommend this hotel. ,5,2017,02,19
211,Zoo package- with 3 kids,"We stayed over night for the zoo package 16th Feb. Had to review!

The staff at every point during our stay where absolutely amazing! Friendly, professional, knowledgeable a real credit to company!

This trip exceeded our expectations at every opportunity. The hotel itself is immaculate the food was first class and the staff second to none!

Can not wait to come back!

211,Fantastic Food & Service,"Stayed here recently and just had to review it because we were absolutely bowled over at the wonderful service and the excellent food.  Everyone from Marta on the front desk to Raj who was just fabulous in the restaurant and later the bar couldn't have been more helpful.
The food in the restaurant was exceptional, I don't know when I had a meal as good as this in a hotel.  We had a good variety of dishes and every one of them went down a treat.  The crab cocktail starter was beautiful and very tasty.  I had the special on the night which was Hake on a seafood risotto and I couldn't say enough about it - divine!
Although we were very full we actually had to try the desserts to see if they matched the quality of starters and mains and they did not disappoint!   
While the bar was busy the restauarant was actually very quiet that night and I was disappointed for the Chef who obviously puts a lot of care and attention into his menu and ingredients.
Rooms were good and the location is excellent so I would highly recommend the hotel and most definitely the restaurant even if you weren't staying here.
Olivia Norris.",5,2017,02,15
211,Just to highlight excellent service at this hotel,Lovely comfortable room and great service at a reasonable price. Very convenient location.Would definitely stay here again on future trips to Dublin.All the staff we met in the hotel were extremely pleasant and helpful.,5,2017,02,14
211,The Croke Park - a real home from home,Just had another great night in The Croke Park. Rooms so comfortable - pillows a real bonus. Chairs in room on fourth floor great place to relax and executive lounge a great bonus. Showers great and so nice to have a real bath.,5,2017,02,14
211,Great hotel,"We chose this hotel in Dublin as we didn't want to be right in the centre and a wall of noise. It was about a 5/10 minute ride by bus or taxi to get into the centre so was ideal. Hotel is great, rooms are immaculate and well kept, the breakfast and bar snacks were tasty and the bar was nice and lively. Had a great two night stay and would highly recommend it.",5,2017,02,13
211,Wonderful Experience,"I stayed at this property on the other side of business trip which had me at another property in Dublin. I really looked forward to a few days of a pleasant mini break after a pretty intense work session. The Croke Park over delivered on my expectations. First and foremost, the staff were super accommodating and friendly, authentically. Both the daytime and nighttime concierges were informative, guiding, most helpful. I truly hold a high standard of service no matter where - but this property delivered. The wait staff were also friendly and responsive - made breakfast every morning a real cheer. Leads to the next, the food was primo and I truly enjoyed the selection at Breakfast and the phenomenal offerings for dinner. The menu was as diverse as it was delish. The concept of a large lounge area by the main dining room was lovely with the large screen projector and fire.  The last meal I had before I left was superb. The hotel interior was modern and clean. I was literally blown away when I walked in captivated by it all. My room was spacious and offered alot of amenities I never expected. Near the executive lounge was a nice plus and was a pleasure when after a full day of walking and sight seeing to have a place of respite, it was available. Housekeeping did a great job both in the am and with the evening refresh. The little chocolates was something I really came to look forward to enjoy. I felt secure in the location and liked the idea that the room key was needed to activate the elevator. Being across the stadium was a plus and I learned a lot there aside from just GAA sports. What may be a yeah or nay for someone, is the hotel proximity to central downtown. I found I could walk to the city center, but if I had a packed itinerary on a given day, I was taxi bound. Which getting a Hailo/taxi and arrival of, was really quick but it did make up for this by a shorter trip to the airport. All and all, it was a wonderful experience...",5,2017,02,12
211,croke park review,"enjoyed  stay food good excellent breakfast room excellent no noise very clean lovely staff we went the week before the the final at croke park, found out recently that my mum had lost twins before i was born their name was Jones surname where is Croke Park hotel found this very emotional as i had not been to Ireland since i was born thanks for the memories",4,2017,02,12
211,This Hotel treats you right,The second time I have stayed here. Everyone on every level is friendly and eager to help. Absolutely perfect stay. Beautiful and spacious rooms. Hospital clean. An overall great experience. I will be back.,5,2017,02,12
211,Wonderful Hotel and Staff.,"We booked this hotel for a minibreak for myself and my wife and her family and I cannot speak highly enough about the quality of the service we experienced from the reception staff to the staff in the restaurant. Nothing was ever too much for them and they always made you feel like you were special.
The rooms were spacious and always clean and well maintained.
We were a bit worried about the location particularly as our family are of a more advanced age but with the bus tour picking up in the morning and dropping off in the afternoon this was not a problem.",5,2017,02,11
211,Perfect location for a conference in Dublin,"This hotel is ideal if you are coming to Dublin for a conference or event at the Croke Park Stadium - which is literally right across the street.  
The hotel room is above average, emphasis being the stand-up shower which is good; but even better is the staff and sideline bistro restaurant and bar in the hotel itself - food and wine was wonderful.  The toiletries in the room are wonderful, and if you ask, they give you a complimentary bottle of water from the front desk.  The concierge was wonderful as well, super friendly and knowledgeable.
It's less recommended for anyone coming to Dublin to discover the city and such as it's out of the way and not really around anything - I arrived on my own for a conference and did not feel comfortable walking around at night.  It's about a 25-30-minute walk to the area you want to be in to enjoy Dublin.  
Overall a great experience for what I needed to be in Dublin for - thank you!",4,2017,02,11
211,Staff were amazing,"While I wasn't booked in to stay at this hotel, I did have the pleasure of going in to the hotel with my husband and 3 year old child for a coffee.
My order was fairly simple, a cappuccino and a scone. While waiting for this one of the male waiters brought my daughter a colouring set. Which was an amazing touch. When the other male waiter came down with my coffee he had brought  my daughter a little babychino and a biscuit. We were both really thrilled. For me it was the attention to detail, we were sitting right at the end of the bar/coffee and they still both noticed that we were with a 3 year old child and brought her both a colouring set and a drink without me having to ask.
I was so impressed. A hugh big thank you to both male waiters who were working yesterday before lunch.
We will definitely be back.",5,2017,02,11
211,Family trip,"Very nice place to stay. Located in close proximity to the main hub of Dublin. Very clean. The bar is a very nice place to sit, relax and just hang out and have a few drinks or something to eat. The food was good and prices were fairly reasonable. We had the full continental breakfast a couple mornings which was good with a fairly decent selection of a variety of foods. Staff was very friendly and helpful. The rooms were very clean and the beds were comfortable. ",4,2017,02,11
211,"Good, exceptional staff","Good, clean, well placed hotel for events or conferences in Croke Park stadium. There aren't many hotels in the area but this isn't the only reason to book. Rooms were clean and warm. Bed was very comfortable and reasonably spacious. Bathroom had separate bath and shower. 
Breakfast was average- again restaurant staff were very attentive and there were cooked as well as buffet options. If I had a business travel purpose in the area I would use this hotel again.",4,2017,02,10
211,It lets itself down,"I stay here frequently on business and have been doing so now for 18 months. Reception staff are generally good, warm, welcoming and more often than not, efficient.

The rooms are comfortable if not starting to be a bit dated, e.g. TV and wooden furniture needs updating. Rooms are a good size, bed is comfortable. I do have issues in some of the bathrooms in that the temperature dial in the shower in some rooms is ""broken"".  I mean that it either the dial doesn't have the temp written on it any more because it has been warn off or the dial doesn't correspond to the correct temp.  This can go one of two ways, the shower is very cold or you scald yourself. Regardless it's dangerous and they need to  pay attention to detail and fix this.

My biggest issue about the hotel is with food and beverage. The sideline bar is adequate but the menu is incredibly boring and lazy. It hasn't changed in some considerable time and there rarely are any specials put on now. This used to be the highlight to ring the changes but no longer seems to be the case. Also depending on who serves you, you may or may not get offered two menus, the bar menu and the bar and restaurant menu. Again this is amount consistency. Regardless of who serves you it should always be just the bar menu or both.  The food when it comes is OK but not outstanding. The biggest issue is the service, more often than not you are ignored and it takes a considerable amount of time to get anyones attention. Case in point this week when on two nights it took 10+ minutes to get served and it wasn't busy. This was despite the fact that staff walked past at least 4 times in each direction, there were 2 managers in the bar both on their phones doing nothing and two staff behind the bar chatting to each other whilst one cleaned glasses and the other leant on the lager pump.

As for the breakfast service, typically I will grab something in the 4th floor lounge. This is normally good, well stocked and clean. But on one occasion this week it was well stocked but not clean. There is normally someone on duty during the breakfast period to check on things but that person didn't appear for at least the 20-25 mins whilst I was there, meaning dirty tables.  As for breakfast in the restaurant, the service sucks. There really is no system and why oh why the person who seats you cant take your drink/toast order too I don't know. They must have the easiest job going just ticking guests off a list because they really don't do anything else. On my one visit to the restaurant this week for breakfast I ordered an omelette. Well 14 mins after ordering it I was approached by the waitress who took the order and told that she had forgotten to put my order in. How hard or complicated can it be?

The hotel is nice, don't get me wrong. But it is the above examples that let it down. And these examples happen consistently so they are not being noticed or addressed. They can and should do better.",3,2017,02,09
211,very good hotel across rod from croke park,"Very good Hotel, nice staff, polite and professional, cleaners really good, room modern and good layout, beds excellent, and quiet. Gym included. If I being one of those people who is hyper critical, breakfast above average, had a meal in the evening which was average but I expected more given the other elements. Still a very good hotel I will be back.",5,2017,02,09
211,⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️,"Hi, I stayed here 7th of February. Had to attend Croke park for a meeting. Obviously very convenient because it's literally across the road. The car park for the hotel was located perfectly for ease of access to the hotel via lift. Reception staff were very friendly and obliging. Again it was easy to get to the room from the lobby. No long marathon like some hotels. The hotel is remarkably clean which great credit must be given to cleaning staff. I could not find any fault and even in the bathroom the tiles on the wall were shining like new. This is ""the cleanest"" hotel I ever stayed in and would certainly recommend and return. Keep up the good work.",5,2017,02,08
211,Pleasant hotel in great location,"The Croke Park hotel is located next to Croke Park Stadium, and about 15 minutes walk from the city center. The staff gave us a very warm welcome, the room was very comfortable and quiet. Breakfast is good. We were very happy to stay here.",4,2017,02,06
211,5 stars from the four of us!,"This is the best hotel I have ever stayed in in Dublin. Without exception EVERY SINGLE member of staff (font desk, concierge, cleaners, restaurant and bar staff) could not do enough to help. The hotel is spotless, lovely foyer, modern, a 10 min walk from city centre - we will NOT stay anywhere else in Dublin. Lovely breakfast with a wide range of hot foods and a very large room with great beds and huge bathroom. Free parking. I got a great for 4 night bed & breakfast for 2 adults and 2 children.",5,2017,02,05
211,Lovely hotel just out of city centre,"I was happy with my 2 night stay at The Croke Park. The room was lovely and the bar had a nice atmosphere. I ate breakfast and dinner here, and was impressed with all my meals. Staff were nice and friendly too.",4,2017,02,04
211,A brilliant stay,"Hotel was brilliant for the duration of our two night stay, great room, very clean and the bar downstairs was a brilliant place for a drink in the evening.

Would definitely visit again, hotel is only a 10 euro taxi from the centre of town. ",5,2017,02,02
211,Wonderful hotel and location,"I stayed at the Croke Park Hotel the night of the company Christmas party, that was across the way in Croke Park. The location doesn't get any better, it was literally a matter of crossing the street, which was a great way to avoid taxis and umbrellas :)
The hotel is modern and stylish, the spaces are well distributed and it feels welcoming and warm.
The room was spacious, modern, clean and well equipped. 
The staff was always professional and helpful.
Considering the quality and the location, the rate we paid wasn't excessive. 
I would definitely go back.",5,2017,02,01
211,Awesome Stay in Dublin,"I have been wanting to write this review for quite some time, and I am finally getting around to it.  MY five year old daughter and I stayed at The Croke Park in July, of 2016 and were extremely happy with absolutely everything.  The hotel staff was very welcoming and extremely helpful with getting directions, booking day trips and getting cabs.

The location of The Croke Park is really great, and is about a 20 minute drive from the airport.  Very convenient if you want to walk to downtown Dublin, and close to a variety of things to do.  

The hotel was very clean, comfortable and well taken care of.  We were very happy with our room, and it had everything that we needed, including a huge bathroom equipped with a tub as well as a stand up shower.  The bed was very comfortable and it was surely needed after a few long days in Dublin exploring the amazing city!

We booked a hop on hop off bus pass right at the front desk (they were EXTREMELY helpful), and we had such a great time.  The hotel staff were simply accommodating in every way.  Because I was travelling alone with my five year old, I was very happy that the staff went out of their way to mention fun activities for her.  That was really nice and very sweet.

We ate breakfast at The Croke Park every morning, and it was fantastic.  We had the price included in our room, and we loved it.  My daughter has severe allergies to nuts, and the staff was extremely careful and attentive with that.  The specially made pan cakes for her and she loved them!  

When we travel to Dublin again, we will surely stay at The Croke Park.  Just a wonderful hotel, so very close to the great city of Dublin, Ireland.",5,2017,01,31
211,The Perfect Hotel ,"My partner and I stayed here two nights for a Dublin break. This hotel completely exceeded my expectations. The staff are wonderful, all of them helpful, friendly and polite. The rooms are spacious with loads of room to put your stuff. It was my partner's birthday so they had put two little bottles of Prosecco in the room for us and wished him happy birthday on arrival.  Everything was spotlessly clean. There is a separate bath and shower and plenty of towels. The beds are so comfortable you want to stay there all day and there are gorgeous big fluffy pillows. There is a radio CD and MP3 player in the room and tea, coffee and hot chocolate plus biscuits. The room temperature can be adjusted however you please. Shower caps, shower gel, body lotion and shampoo and conditioner are provided and refreshed daily. The buffet breakfast is great and there is fruit, pastries, a selection of hot drinks, full cooked breakfast, toast and cereals. Basically everything you could want. Yes, it's a little way out from main town but we found nice places to eat and drink ten minutes walk away on Drumcondra Road. This hotel really was perfect and I would highly recommend it - parking is free for guests as well.",5,2017,01,30
211,Exceeded expectations,"The hotel was booked as part of a conference at the stadium opposite.  We took the Aircoach (number 700)  from the airport which was about 20 minutes and cost 6Euros one way - the taxi back was only 25 Euros.  It is literally less than 5 minutes walk from the stop (which is the first stop on the route).  

The welcome (with a hot towel) was excellent and check-in was smooth and quick.  Rooms are well appointed with TV, CD, iron/ironing board, complimentary tea/coffee, hairdryer, trouser press and The White Company toiletries in the bathroom.  Plenty of hanging space for clothes, a safe in the wardrobe, extra pillows.  The room (which had a double and single bed) was spacious and offered plenty of space to work and plenty of plug sockets for phones/laptops etc.,    Bathroom had a separate bath and walk-in shower and was bright and very clean. 

 We had a nice handwritten note from the Sales Manager and some chocolates (this may not be the norm but done as we were part of a conference group).     We didn't experience breakfast due to the two early starts but did have room service which was efficient and reasonable.   Each time we visited the reception they were helpful and knowledgeable.  Whilst we didn't see much of the public areas they appeared to be well frequented, modern and bright.   There was an ice machine in each floor - all of which were very secure as you had key card entry only for the lifts. 

The room was overlooking a small canal/residential area and train line.   Even with the window slightly open the trains were far and few between and not intrusive. 

The hotel is a slightly out from the centre but if you don't mind travelling in it is worth the stay - it is obviously excellent for the stadium which is directly opposite. 

A very good stay and would highly recommend.",5,2017,01,30
211,Great place to stay in Dublin,"Located in quiet surrounding, city  center is by taxi only 8 Euros away. 
Rooms are comfortable, very new and very very clean! 
Staff was friendly, called a cab and pointed out some restaurants in the city center.",5,2017,01,30
211,Pleasant and efficient,"I stayed at Croke Park for one night on business. It was easily accessible from the airport. The staff were pleasant and efficient and the room was comfortable and reasonably well equipped. I didn't very easy. Walking alone in the nearby streets, but fine if you go by taxi.",4,2017,01,29
211,Great Value!,"My girlfriend and I were here from Dec. 29th through Jan. 7th.  The facilities are new, clean, and the staff exceptionally friendly and helpful.  There is a bar and restaurant inside the hotel as well if you want to grab a bite or a drink and don't feel like traveling that day.  There is free wifi along with some computers in the lobby if you need to print anything.  Parking is also free for guests if you decide to rent a car, located under the complex.  The place is exceptional, especially for the price.

My only gripe is the location.  As it was my first time in Dublin, I wasn't familiar with the neighborhoods so I didn't take that in to consideration when booking my trip.  The hotel is located in a residential area and there aren't too many options for food unless you want to walk 10-15 minutes every time.  It also gets a little sketchy once you head north of the hotel.  City Centre is also a 15-30 minute walk, depending on where you're headed.

If you don't mind walking a little bit (we did not), I definitely recommend the place.  Worth the exercise.",5,2017,01,26
211,Fabulous stay again,"This was my second stay at this hotel, and yet again it was a pleasure. I was on the 4th floor this time and received access to the Executive Lounge, which is perfect of a business traveler like me. It's a quiet place to sit and work either on your own or with colleagues, and there's the added perk of there being drink and snacks available there all the time.
The rooms are very comfortable, clean, and roomy with a tea/coffee making corner. I even had robes and slippers in the wardrobe. There was an evening turn down service and they left chocolates on the bed - nice touch.
The bathrooms are spotless. I love the fact that there;s both a shower and bath. So many hotel don't have baths anymore. Plenty of shampoo, conditioner and body cream - only complaint is that they are sometimes impossible to open!
Fabulous choice at breakfast.
Very friendly and helpful staff.
The only downside is that it isn't in the centre, but it's only a short ride away. I walked into one of the shopping areas from the hotel and it took me approx 20 mins.
All in all a lovely hotel! Highly recommended.
",5,2017,01,26
211,My Second Home:),"I stayed@ this lovely place every time I land in Dublin.They can't be any nicer, the rooms are spotless the food is excellent. 
The executive lounge is the best I can go in anytime 24 hours a day and get what ever I want. 
 I wouldn't stay anyplace else. 
",5,2017,01,25
211,"Stunning hotel, excellent staff, fantastic food...","I had never been to Dublin before and booked a city break so that the room and hotel reservations were all handled at the same time. We had an early morning flight and landed at 0740 at Dublin airport. With this in mind I contacted the hotel to ask about being able to store our luggage until we could check-in in the afternoon. I didn't fancy hanging onto the cases until the afternoon and was grateful to learn that we would be able to leave them with the concierge and that they would be secure. 
We had looked at several other hotels which were closer to the centre but each time found ourselves being drawn back towards Croke Park. We're glad we did. 
The hotel is beautifully decorated and the pictures do it justice. Our room was spotlessly clean and being on the 4th floor, it also enabled us to have access to the Execuive lounge where there was complimentary tea, coffee, soft drinks and water. In the morning you could also enjoy a continental breakfast. 
We had only booked a normal room, but on arrival found that we had been given a complimentary upgrade due to it actually being my wife's 40th birthday. 
That said, we found every single member of staff [from receptionists to cleaners, concierge to bar and restaurant staff], to be extremely helpful and polite. 
On our first night we stayed in the restaurant and found the food to be fantastic. The bar area was a nice area to retire to, for a few drinks and a nightcap before bed. 
Top tip for staying there would be to check out the green bus service that picks up from the hotel. It'll take you near to O'Connell street and most things are within easy access from there. The green bus is a ""hop on/hop off"" service and is actually a guided tour of Dublin. We only ever intended using it as a means to an ends in terms of getting back into the centre... only to find that the driver [Anthony] was probably the funniest bus driver in the world... we stayed on for the entire tour which was both educational and entertaining in equal measure. 

All in all, we had a fantastic time in Dublin and know that we made the right choice in terms of hotel. I've already recommended it to work colleagues and would have no hesitation whatsoever, in staying there again. 

One last thing, if you travel via bus from the airport, the number 16 is the one you'll need. This takes you past Drumcondra railway station which is a 10 minute walk from Croke Park itself.",5,2017,01,25
211,Hands down the best hotel in dublin,"Stayed in the Croke Park hotel last week with my family (children included) and what can I say AMAZING. The staff,the service,the food, the rooms all couldn't fault. From the minute you walk in the door you feel welcome.... Can't wait to go back 😀😀 Thank you for everything! ",5,2017,01,24
211,Very nice hotel! ,"Love the hotel,  booked for my partners birthday, there was a cake and prosecco in the room for us on arrival, the staff were friendly and could not do enough for you! 
The rooms are spacious, clean and have everything you need. The location isn't great, taxis are around 12-15 euros to city center eg. Temple bar. There is a green Dublin tour hop on and off bus which stops outside but it doesn't run to the hotel after 4pm. ",5,2017,01,23
211,Amazing View,"Waking up to look out you window at Croke Park, great service,great staff very good stay. stayed for a conference in Croke Park was extremely happy with the hotel bedrooms and food were very good could not fault the hotel",5,2017,01,23
211,Great hotel.  Location not so great,"Unless you are here for a match at the Croke Park stadium which is right next door, this great hotel is a bit far from the tourist sections of town.  The hotel is nice with modern rooms and a good restaurant. ",4,2017,01,22
211,Superb hotel,"I stayed here for a three day business trip last week. 
The room was spotlessly clean and very well appointed with armchair/easy chair and table; work area with swivel chair and a wonderful bed. Bathroom was gleaming and had loads of toiletries. 
The room was just the right temperature. 
I heard no sounds any night so a great night sleep was had each night!
There is an ice machine and ice water facility in the lobby. 
Parking is free, secure and underground. 
Breakfast was delicious and a huge range of food available. 
All staff without exception were professional, helpful and friendly. 
I hope to return again. ",5,2017,01,21
211,Outstanding visit,Staff exceedingly nice and helpful with information.  We had a king size room in Executive suite which included Continental breakfast.  It also included a free pint of Guinness or a glass of wine for each visitor per day!  Turn down service as well.  Hop on Hop off bus stops right across the street and a taxi ride to town center is less than 15 Euro.  Can't say enough about how every staff member encountered is so pleasant and helpful.  Will definitely stay here again.,5,2017,01,20
211,Great hotel,"Stayed here for 1 night. Lovely room,we didn't eat here so can't comment. Very handy for getting into Dublin. Can't fault it. Receptionist was from Dublin and was great for getting directions etc. Free parking also if you have the car with you?",5,2017,01,19
211,Good business offer,"Good location in town and all very modern and clean. Breakfast was excellent.
I would reccommend this hotel iof you are overnighting in Dublin. A little away from the craic but close enough to dip into.",4,2017,01,19
211,Loved this hotel!,"I stayed there in 2012 and I can't imagine that it's changed all that much. The rooms were clean, the food was excellent, beds were soft, the staff was very friendly and helpful. Even though it's across from a stadium, the walls, doors and windows were insulated enough that the events going on were nearly unnoticeable.
It's also walking distance from nearly anywhere you may want to go anywhere in Dublin.",5,2017,01,18
211,Guinness time,"Had a lovely stay here for the weekend. Lovely hotel, staff very friendly and efficient. The rooms were spotlessly clean and well tended by housekeeping. The executive floor has its own lounge with free refreshments available (tea/coffee/fruit etc).The hotel is on the outskirts of Dublin but it was a nice walk into the centre with a short taxi ride back. The Guinness factory is worth a visit",5,2017,01,18
211,Annie & Mick Davidson ,"Second time we have been to Croke park hotel for our wedding anniversary and it is an absolute joy to stay here. Rooms are well looked after, spacious and practical. Such a friendly atmosphere and staff are great. Food is lovely and for breakfast your spoilt for choice all in all a very nice hotel and what you get for your money is exceptional. Thank you for a nice place to stay for our special time. Some photos of the room and room service.",5,2017,01,17
211,Helpful and Honest Staff A++++,"We stayed here for a night before heading home via the Dublin airport.  The staff was very welcoming and the room was very clean.  We couldn't have been happier with the hotel.  

In addition, we accidentally left money in our safe when we left for the airport.  We didn't notice until many hours later.  When we contacted the hotel, a staff member had turned in our money.  The manager then was EXTREMELY helpful in getting the money returned to us.  We are so grateful for the staff's honesty and helpfulness.  If ever in Dublin again, we will definitely stay at this hotel.

I would recommend this hotel to anyone in the Dublin area.  You don't find honesty much anymore like we did at this hotel.  Highly recommended!  

THANK  YOU Croke Park hotel!!",5,2017,01,17
211,great days to Croke Park Hotel,Great locations staf really friendly. My family and I spent a really good time. the day became with a fantastic breakfast by the hotel. The hotel was very clean and near city centre. a shuttle to centre is avaiable from the hotel.,5,2017,01,17
211,What a huge improvement!!!!!...,"I confess I gave this place a bad food review the last time because food allergy wasn't handled well... I made a return visit for a function just before Christmas, and WOW!... What a difference!!!... The staff moved Heaven and Earth to make sure I had a good dining experience!... I couldn't have the bread, but the soup starter was delicious, and as a Turkey dinner is boring without the cranberry, stuffing etc trimmings, they cooked me a delicious steak dinner complete with mushrooms and onions!!!... I couldn't have the Mince Pie dessert, but I was ven a delicious alternative... After my previous experience, I admit I was VERY dubious about returning, but I'm very glad that I did!... I really enjoyed it!... Thank you very much, everyone!....",5,2017,01,16
211,Great Value,Lovely hotel and lovely staff.  Cant fault the hotel for is food or cleanliness.  Good location.  Would stay again.  We were here for my husbands birthday and he enjoyed every minute.  Walking distance to the town where there are great restaurants and bars.,5,2017,01,16
211,Fab stay Croke Park Hotel,"Stayed 2 nights at Croke Park and couldn't fault my stay. Staff were welcoming and friendly upon arrival. Quick check-in and went out of their way to accommodate us all on the same floor. Rooms were clean and comfortable. Breakfast wasn't included in our room rate but when we enquired at the front desk we offered a discount voucher and breakfast buffet was excellent. Overall I cannot fault the staff, especially reception staff, 10 out of 10 for them - so friendly and helpful.",5,2017,01,16
211,Excellent Customer Service,"The perfect place to stay.  Great location,  great prices and a great place to eat or even just stop for a coffee.  
All staff are super friendly but would just like to mention Therese in the bar/dining area.  We were served by her on a few occasions over our last few visits,  and we all complimented her excellent customer service. 
Well done, Tara and Laura",5,2017,01,15
211,How good is this place!,"What a great hotel! The staff are so helpful and friendly. We are in a deluxe  room and it is lovely, very clean and spacious. Lovely breakfast too. Will definitely be back. Would recommend  this hotel to anyone. About 20 min walk in to centre of Dublin",5,2017,01,15
211,RIP off Hotel who do not want children,"I rang the Croke Park Hotel this morning to book a room for Saturday night 25th March, 2017 Bed and Breakfast. I was quoted 140 euro. I asked the lady in reservations would it be possible to put two travel cots in the room as we have two children aged 1 and 2. She advised me that we would now require a family room which would make the booking more expensive. I explained that the babies would not be requiring breakfast and that we stay in hotels quite alot and that travel cots are free. At this point I asked to speak to a Manager. A lady called ORLA DUTY MANAGER rang me back and I explained the reason I asked her to call me back. I was quoted 140 for myself amd my husband by the receptionists and when the Duty Manager knew I wanted two travel cots she told me the room would cost 220 euro (40 per cot) 140 plus 80. When I explained to her that hotels don't ever charge for travel cots she then tries telling me that the receptionists gave me the wrong rate initially that she understood it was 6th March. I clearly said Saturday 25th March and she repeated it back to me. 6th March is a Monday. In my opinion this hotel is a complete rip off charging 40 euro per travel cot so I would advise any families planning on staying here in the future to be very careful when booking as you will be charged alot more than what other hotels are charging for kids.",1,2017,01,15
211,Nearly but not quite....!,"The Croke Park Hotel is a reasonably priced hotel located within the shadow of Croke Park about a mile outside of Dublin City Centre.

There is ample parking in the Hotels underground car park from which you can take a lift either directly to reception or to your floor.

Checking in was very efficiently and courteously done by the friendly reception staff.

My room was very comfortable with both a single and a double bed ; the bathroom excelled as it boasted both a bath and a shower plus an ample supply of toiletries.

I always tried to keep my room tidy however it was never as tidy and well presented as that carried out by the cleaning staff on a daily basis - honestly I thought that I'd walked into a brand new room every time I came back from my days work so clean was it (that cleanliness extended into the public areas and one day coming back I watched as one of the staff took her time to carefully clean the lift lobby on my floor missing not one bit including the skirtings.

I and my colleagues ate every evening in the Sideline Bistro and Bar which is a very modern themed place and with ample large TV screens to watch football and any other programmes of interest- the menu is fairly limited in choice (no different to many hotels these days ) however fairly reasonably priced. The best starter by a mile was the fish chowder (I've never tasted better) ; main course wise the fish and chips ; the burgers ; the special when I was there of chicken wings in a sweet chilli sauce and skinny fries (brilliant!) and the Shepherds pie (Sheppard's  Pie on the menu) all hit the spot however I do confess to being disappointed by the scampi which turned out to be breaded prawns - whilst I must accept that prawns can be included under the definition of 'scampi' its very rarely that this is the case and as I don't like prawns I felt a bit let down by the description of the dish. The ice cream was nice but with three small scoops was never going to be enough..

Again I should compliment the bar and restaurant staff who were nothing but efficient.

There was a slight confusion over our bill (which I still don't understand) when checking out (my colleagues experienced the same issue) however the issue was apparently sorted out without really explaining to us what had gone wrong.

All in all I can't but help feel that whilst I did enjoy my stay at the Croke Park, and would loved to have marked it slightly higher, the issue with the scampi and the check out experience slightly tarnished my visit (albeit on the scale of things and compared to the many positives of my stay these are to be honest fairly minor issues.)",4,2017,01,13
211,GOOD VALUE HOTEL,"Clean, modern and very friendly. 
The bar/Restaurant area is large and the bar snacks large and tasty.
HUGE projected TV screen for sports fans in the bar.
Rooms large and well equipped with a double and a single bed.
Bathrooms good size and good quality toiletries.
A five minute taxi ride to Dublin City centre.
Breakfast choices typical for a 4 star hotel, though I was offered, without asking if I would like an omelette!
Probably NOT a good hotel if Ireland are playing Rugby in the stadium which is next door, unless you have tickets!",5,2017,01,11
211,First visit to Dublin,First time my friend and I had visited Dublin and booked the hotel and line and we were not disappointed staff were helpful and informative and the place felt relaxed and secure. It was great value for money.,5,2017,01,09
211,Lovely modern hotel,Stayed here for 3 days with my husband & teenage daughter.  What a great hotel & great staff.  It is a little out of the way from the center & approx. 8 euros in taxi so soon adds up.  Was told the area around the hotel not very safe at night & not to walk back.  Hotel bar fantastic & room service was brilliant.  I would deffo recommend staying here.,5,2017,01,09
211,Nice enough base 15min walk from centre of Dublin,"Hotel situated opposite croke park... taxi from the Airport to the hotel cost 30 Euros funny the return trip back cost 20 (obviously ripped off by the taxi coming in!!)

Hotel to the centre of Dublin about a 15min walk, nice enough if the rain holds off... out the hotel go right, walk straight until you hit the church and then go right!

Room spacious enough, shower strong and plenty of towels... hotel bar nice all be it expensive that said some of the bars in Temple area more expensive than the hotel.... breakfast nothing special nor bad.

It was generally all ok neither off the scale amazing or a disaster so perfect for a break essentially spend out side the hotel.",4,2017,01,08
211,Thank you Croke Park Hotel!!💕,"This is a great hotel if you are visiting the great city of Dublin!  Very comfortable and roomy.  The restaurant and bar were great.  Breakfast was a great value and quite good.  The Hop on Hop Off bus has shuttle that picks you up right in front of the hotel.  But the thing that made it for us was the helpfulness of the staff.  I fractured my ankle on the first leg of my journey and the concierge, Christopher, helped us find a wheelchair to rent on short notice so I was able to enjoy almost all of our planned excursions to the fullest.  If we are fortunate enough to return to lovely Ireland again we will definitely stay at the Croke Park!  Many thanks and warmest regards Croke Park!",5,2017,01,08
211,Excellent Hotel,"We stayed in an executive king for two nights. Lovely modern room with large bathroom, nice to have a turn down service. Restaurant food was excellent as was the bar service. Staff in all areas were smart, pleasant and professional. Concierge very friendly and knowledgeable. Our first night was spoilt by the idiot in the room next to us having his tv on until half three in the morning! Reception swiftly dealt with this on becoming aware. Executive lounge a real bonus if waiting for airport transfers. Will definitely be back!",5,2017,01,06
211,great hotel with excellent staff and food,"We stayed at The Croke Park  just after Christmas and what a pleasant stay it was.
We stayed in a family room, which was comfortable and unlike other hotels wasn't uncomfortable hot, it was just right.  We parked our car in the car park which was secure and free.  One of the nights we returned late, and were met by security and asked for our room number etc.  We were very impressed with this which made us feel safe and secure.
The breakfast we had were as good or better than any hotel which we have stayed in and cost alot more.  If we were to return to Dublin we wouldn't go past this hotel.  Well done and keep up the good work, for once all the reviews are accurate. Also the water for the trip home was appreciated very much.
",5,2017,01,03
211,Best beds and breakfast,The Croke Park hotel is second to none in terms of the quality of the beds and the breakfast.  A great sleep in a really comfortable bed. Friendly and efficient staff. Breakfast is very well presented with a huge variety of options.  Well worth a visit.,5,2017,01,03
211,100% recommend this Hotel ,"Me and My boyfriend were staying for the New year our first time in Dublin. We booked the hotel as it had received excellent reviews, they were all 100%  accurate! From arrival up until leaving all of  the staff not only on reception but throughout the hotel were exceptionality friendly, helpful and took great care of us! The double room was very spacious, clean and contained everything you possibly needed for 3 nights! The little chocolates on your bed on an evening and fresh water was an added bonus. The executive lounge was a great little re treat area for a quiet cup of coffee/ tea and it was lovely to have breakfast there too. The restaurant/bar had a lovely atmosphere, table service and food was excellent! It was a good walk in to town at 20 minutes to hit the main shopping area, but we both throughly 
enjoy walking, but the hotel would happily arrange taxis in to town only costing €6/7, which we did do New Year's Eve as I wanted to wear my heels! They also have a room to keep your Luggage until your transport time. We both were thrilled with the Hotel for the duration of our stay and would 100% return and recommend this Hotel to anyone! 
Thank you Croke Park x",5,2017,01,03
211,"Large, clean rooms","This hotel offers excellent rates. We had a car and were able to park in the car park underneath the hotel at no charge. It is across from the massive Croke Park stadium, home of the Gaelic Athletic Association so check to see if games are scheduled before you book -- unless, of course, you want to go to a game. The hotel is modern, the rooms are large, the beds comfortable, and the breakfast is very good -- although we arrived at opening time and the regular staff was not yet serving tables (the breakfast is buffet style but you need to order coffee and egg dishes from the server). We found a nice restaurant just up the street.",4,2017,01,02
211,"Well run, good hotel.","The hotel was opposite the stadium, which was pretty far out of town, but we still walked every day. The hotel seemed a little pricey at first, but when compared to other hotels it was a competitive rate but was a lot better than other options. The hotel was run very well, a step up from other chains I have stayed at before and would certainly recommend it (as long as the price is right, I feel we got a bargain). The hotel were helpful with all our requests, the room was nice, clean and modern. Everything we could possibly of hoped for. Quieter area also (apart from perhaps on game days).",5,2017,01,02
211,Amazing New Year Break,"Beautiful hotel. Rooms very clean and cosy (our room was room 409 highly reccomend) We had entry to the executive lounge where we could help ourself to cold bottles of water and bottles of fresh orange and apple juice also Tea, Coffee, hot Chocolate and Shortbread biscuits . We also got free vouchers for the bar during our stay.
Customer service in hotel was amazing they go above and beyond for you, the maid would knock on our door every morning and night to see if we wanted any bottles of water, chocolates or fresh towels. 
The hotel is about a 15 minute walk into town but its a nice walk as you get to see lots of other places on the way.
Exceeded expectations will be returning! Shout out to Sean the man at reception for his great customer service! 
Nicole and Gary x",5,2017,01,02
211,Excellent experience ,"Me and my friend came to Dublin from 29th Dec-1st Jan for a New Years City break and stayed at the Croke Park Hotel. The only fault was it wasn't right in the city centre but didn't take us long to walk there each day we was there. The hotel staff were very friendly and welcoming, any questions or queries we had they were happy to assist us, the facilities were very clean and attractive. Would recommend and stay here in the future again.  ",4,2017,01,02
211,Great hotel for a new year's wkend break ,"Staying here for NYE 2016/17. A bit out of the centre but just a couple of euros to get the bus into the city and it's the right side of town for us to get an early flight on the way home. Spacious rooms, extremely clean, great bathrooms (white company products) and one of the best hotel brekkies we've ever had. Would recommend and stay again. ",4,2017,01,01
211,Expected Better,"Came down with my girlfriend. Stayed 21st & 22nd of December. Room was clean. Bed wasn't overly comfortable and the TV was seriously out of date technology. Picture quality wasn't great either. The bathroom was clean but could use a lick of paint.

Ate dinner in the hotel restaurant the first night.  Have to say the food was very nice. Wine was a little over priced as we can buy the same brand in Derry for half the price.

Executive lounge was ok basically paying extra for free water and apple juice. Breakfast was serviced there too which was nothing exceptional. 

Overall I think I was a little disappointed as I have stayed in a lot of hotels throughout Europe and had very high hopes for this one. Would maybe try again in a year or 2 to see if they have improved. This has the potential to be an exceptional hotel to be fair. The lobby and layout are very nicely decorated however guests are not paying to stay in the lobby. My advice would be to spend more money on improving the rooms before improving the lobby.",3,2016,12,31
211,Perfect ,"My boyfriend and I came to Dublin for a long weekend, we were recommended to stay at the Croke Park by friends and we were not disappointed. The rooms are huge, the bathroom has a full size bath (which I used every night after been on my feet all day), white company toiletries, towels and face cloths.
A surprise as we only booked a standard room included a separate dressing type room with a table and chair with full length mirror.
We didn't book breakfast with the room so we went out on the first morning then the second day we had breakfast at the hotel and then wondered why we tried anywhere else as it was amazing! Great value for money and lots of choice.
The hotel is about 15-20 minute walk into the centre of Dublin so nice and quiet and very hand for anyone visiting the Croke Park stadium as it's literally across the road.
The staff at the Croke Park were fabulous, very friendly and always happy to help! 
So overall the hotel is great, again easy access to the Croke Park stadium, 15-20 minutes walk to the city centre, 30 minute walk to temple bar.
The hotel is spotless and rooms get cleaned every day without fail. 
Great value for money for the standard at the hotel! 
We will be back :-)",5,2016,12,29
211,Lovely,Little walk to the bus stop in the dark so we decided to get a taxi instead. Not far from the centre and directly opposite the stadium. Didn't feel particularly safe for the 1 minute we were outside late at night but that really wasn't a big deal as we were in lit areas by the hotel and got a taxi. Loved our stay in Dublin itself and had the best time. The hotel was modern and clean and warm and cosy. The staff were very helpful and kind and we would return here again :),4,2016,12,29
211,Perfect stay in Dublin,"Everything was perfect! The room was very clean and big, king bed that was wonderful. We had access to the executive lounge wit nice breakfast and a wonderful place to relax. Just a perfect stay in wonderful Dublin  ",5,2016,12,28
211,Revisited,"I had given this hotel a bad review years ago, but they have turned it around. Rooms have gotten better & it seems this hotel has been revamped. Front desk was very helpful holding my bags for me as my room wasn't ready, but to be fair I was checking in early. Bar staff need to be more on point as we had to wait a lot & it was not busy at all. Also an Irish hotel should serve an Irish breakfast. We left hotel to get 1 & their coffee is undrinkable. But besides those minor things hotel is great",4,2016,12,27
211,Fantastic family friendly ,"We had a lovely stay here just before Christmas, after arriving late off a ferry from Holyhead and travelling from Edinburgh, we were tired and hungry. Finding the family more than big enough for us all to stretch out and our room service arrived within 20 mins. Staff, food and atmosphere in the hotel were all first class and I've recommended to any of my family travelling too or through Dublin in the future ",5,2016,12,26
211,vacation to Dublin,"Great Hotel, exceptional value.  Particularly liked the experience for 4th floor and above guests with the private lounge!! Food, beverages, television, comfortable chairs. 24/7. Courteous staff. Great place to play cards and just kick back. ",5,2016,12,24
211,Spectacular Few nights in Dublin.,"Stayed at The Croke Park between 23rd-26th November and it was a brilliant stay. Was given early check in as we arrived at 10am at no extra cost or contention. 

Location is good if you prefer to be outside of the main hustle and bustle. You can get to the main town via a 20 minute walk. They also offer a 3 day hop on/ hop off bus tour pass.

Every single person we came across and not just in the hotel but passers-by were so friendly, helpful and welcoming. (*well besides one aircoach driver)

I will be returning to Dublin in the New Year and staying at the Croke Park again. The rooms are well maintained and clean, as same with the entire hotel. It's very classy and after a busy day of roaming the streets you can retire to the bar. 

Brought breakfast vouchers when we arrived as we assumed there would be somewhere to grab breakfast locally with the stadium being directly opposite, but that isn't the case so may be best to get room with Breakfast included which I will be doing in the future. 

Perfect hotel for a perfect stay in Dublin. 

Slàinte",5,2016,12,24
211,Never disappoints,"Just back from another stay at the Croke Park hotel. Excellent service and hospitality as always. Checked in and out by James, a trainee.  James will not need much training as he was very professional, friendly and super efficient. Love their rooms and all their facilities, their bar food is delicious as well. My wife and I will be back again next Thursday 29th for yet another stay.  I have no doubt that we will be treated in the same professional, hospital manner as on all our previous stays.
As it says in the review title, don't spend time reading endless reviews on TripAdvisor, the Croke Park hotel never disappoints.

Mr & Mrs B McNally",5,2016,12,22
211,Excellent hospitality,"We have stayed in this hotel on numerous occasions when we have visited family and friends. It is a very comfortable, modern, clean and friendly place to stay.  The food is excellent and above all the staff are friendly, helpful and professional. It's a very popular hotel and even at its busiest times the service is first class. The bedrooms are very comfortable and very quiet. My husband and I are elderly but we have stayed here with my daughter and 3 children and they loved the hotel for all the reasons I have listed but also because it is a very child friendly place.
It is a short walk into the centre of Dublin which is very convenient for visitors to this unique city.
Thank you to The manager and all the staff for always making our visit to Dublin special.
There is free wifi",5,2016,12,22
211,Very good place for your stay,"Very good hotel, clean and with all the facilities you may need. The room has enough space for everything. The bus stop is at a short walking distance and you can also reach the city center with a 20 minutes walk if you wish to. Very friendly staff always ready to help.
",5,2016,12,21
211,Excellent stay,Great atmosphere and location. Well worth a stay if in Dublin. Spacious rooms. Huge bathroom with large bath and power shower. Was there at an event so that had a big influence on the atmosphere. Breakfast was top notch also. ,5,2016,12,21
211,Dublin birthday treat,We were exceptionally happy with our stay at The Croke Park. We arrived early for check in but were still able to use the hotels facilities and store our luggage. The staff were friendly and helpful. The bar area was very relaxing and our first pints of Guiness were consumed. Our rooms were spacious and very comfortable I would have liked to bring the bed and pillows home with me !!!! Location is a little out of the centre but we could walk into town in about 15/20 mins. If you are attending an event at the Croke Park Stadium you literally have to step out of the front door and you are there!!!!!! We had a fabulous weekend and would recommend this hotel whole heartedly. ,5,2016,12,20
211,Lovely Hotel,"Had my Christmas Dinner and stayed overnight. A lovely hotel, staff very friendly and helpful. A lovely meal too, very full after it. Easy car parking facilities. Right across from Croke Park Stadium. Also not too far from the city.",4,2016,12,19
211,Lovely Hotel,"Me and my partner stayed here for two nights and the hotel was lovely. Great service and added touches such as hot towels on check in and bottled water on check out. We also was able to check in a couple of hours early as our room was ready. We were able to leave our luggage in the reception area securely for a couple of hours after checking out whilst we finished exploring before heading back to the airport which was a bonus as we didn't fly until evening time. The ONLY downside was the hotel not being overly close to many restaurant/bars and temple bar etc. But that being said, the reception staff were always on hand to book you a taxi, which would arrive within minutes. Taxi to temple bar for around €10 and taxi to airpot for around €25. Would stay again.",4,2016,12,19
211,mr. murphy,stayed for two nights  this was our third time at the hotel our room was very good clean and bath room also spotless car parking free even if the spaces are a little small not much space to open the door over all very enjoyable stay and would  use the hotel again,5,2016,12,19
211,Fabulous!,"I had reason to attend a function in Croke Park recently and stayed in The Croke Park Hotel overnight.  I can't recommend the Hotel highly enough.  Our room was beautiful, lovely linens, towels, bathroom products.  Beautiful breakfast in the lovely Executive Suite the next day gave us a lovely quiet start to our day.  I will definitely stay again!  ",5,2016,12,19
211,Excellent stay,"An absolutely fantastic stay.  Wonderful experience as usual.  Close to city centre, within walking distance.  Highly recommend.  Food reasonably priced.  Staff very friendly.  Ample car parking, free for guests.",5,2016,12,19
211,croke park hotel,"excellent service and not too expensive. I have stayed here before with my family, April 2016 and as always treated very well by the staff. My own family and myself highly recommend this hotel to visitors",5,2016,12,18
211,JK,"Very good experience would highly recommend it. The staff were very helpful and considerate. The only negative was some loud music from Christmas party nights at the Stadium, bout it did not last until the early hours and was manageable.",5,2016,12,17
211,Comfortable stay at The Croke Park Hotel,Weekend away to concert in Three arena. We stayed in The Croke Park Hotel. Lovely hotel in a great location just a short walk takes you to Dublin city centre. Good food in nice surroundings.  Good for couples or families. Easy parking facilities.,4,2016,12,16
211,Fantastic hotel and staff,"The hotel was lovely and clean, comfortable beds and friendly staff, would definitely recommend to others.
The ambience and general feel of the room and public areas very wonderful.
 20 minute walk into the centre but easily accessible via Taxi.",5,2016,12,16
211,Full of extra touches to make you feel special,"At The Croke Park Hotel from the moment we arrived we were treated so well and really made to feel special. Everything about this hotel is quality and just right. The location, although slightly out of the centre was not a problem for us at all and took nothing away from our stay, for around 10 euros in a taxi we were in the city centre. Breakfast was really great as well. We were lucky enough to visit with the christmas decorations up and the hotel was so cozy. A great stay and I highly recommend this hotel.",5,2016,12,15
211,Stunning Hotel! ,"The hotel itself is simply stunning and the staff are very friendly and helpful. I booked this hotel for my boyfriends birthday and we both thoroughly enjoyed our stay! Rooms were clean and spacious, beds were comfy and shower was great. Had some food at the hotel for lunch aswell which was also lovely. Would definitely book again without hesitation. ",5,2016,12,15
211,EXCELLENT AS ALWAYS,We have stayed at the hotel for the last 3 years. the staff are very attentive and friendly. the breakfast is superb. the rooms are very well equipped and quiet. the bar area is very relaxing. you are a taxi or long walk to the centre but it is something we do not mind,5,2016,12,14
211,Marvelous Hotel,"The hotel was great.  Room was larger than we expected.  Staff members were extremely helpful.  The Concierge service was out of this world.  The Bistro and Lounge were fantastic.  Wonderful first international trip!  You won't go wrong staying here.  It's close to the airport as well as downtown centre of Dublin.  They have a shuttle that runs every 15 minutes downtown, although it's just a short 15-20 minute walk if you prefer.  We plan to return in the future and this is where we will be staying.  Although the website shows that it was a 4 star hotel, we would give it a 5 star rating hands down.",5,2016,12,13
211,Great family hotel! ,"Got an excellent rate for b&b in the Croke Park hotel. Had requested 2 cots for the room which was organised with no fuss. The room we were then given was perfect and big enough for the cots with plenty of space to move around in. This was greatly appreciated. Room was clean and nicely furnished. Pillows were hard which was one of the only negatives. Bathroom was nice and clean and a good size as well. The hotel was extremely busy for the weekend was in it but that was nice for the atmosphere and not off putting. We ate in the bistro for the evening meal, the options were good with prices a bit over the average. Food itself was very nice and the staff were very accommodating with highchairs and children’s options. We ate down here for the breakfast the next morning. Very good choice of breads and cereals which were very nice. The hot food was average. No ketchup which I asked for but never arrived was another negative. Overall we had a very nice overnight stay in the Croke Park Hotel and we will be back again in 2017. I will definitely recommend to friends and family.",4,2016,12,12
211,"A pleasant stay, only a brief walk to the city centre","I stayed at the Croke Park Hotel with my partner for 3 nights, in the superior suite as part of a deal we found. 

The staff were friendly, helpful and there was no hassle with checking in, we could easily leave our bags there several hours before we could check in.

Once checked in we found our floor, as part of the suite, had it's own private lounge that had access to a comfortable seating area, TV, coffee and a variety of food, all of which was pre-paid for.

The room was great, although the TV did seem a little outdated, but at the end of the day that wasn't really an issue as we were in Dublin and were there to see the site and drink Guinness!",5,2016,12,12
211,Touch of class,"Other than the elevator being an issue (you need your key and it is hit and miss with getting to the floor), the rooms were spacious with all the needed amenities.  Separate tub and stand up shower.  Excellent beds and soft pillows. Very clean overall.  Breakfast was enjoyable with a full spread that also included fresh honeycomb. Yummy",5,2016,12,11
211,Great hotel (a bit off the beaten path),"We had a great stay here, got a great rate (be ready, they will try to upsell you a number of times, but I politely refused each time with no further fuss) that included breakfast. Its a well kept, modern hotel, nice staff (one concierge was initially a bit pushy on some of the tours offered, but backed off when we clearly indicated we weren't interested), with all the requisite conveniences, including a good buffet breakfast. Check the Croke Park Stadium event schedule before booking as the hotel is literally right across the street from the stadium (nothing going on there during our visit, but I imagine it gets very busy and interesting when there is an event there, IIRC it holds 80,000+). Though it should be obvious, the hotel is not located in the general downtown Dublin area. It was about a 15-20 minute walk (about 1km with a very mild bit of incline/decline) to the O'Connell/Henry Street intersection, which didn't bother us as we generally prefer to walk a city, but could be a bit of a problem if one has a back/leg issue or general difficulty walking. Cabs are plentiful. All in all, we would stay here again if we visit Dublin again. ",4,2016,12,11
211,Great hotel,Stayed here for one night as we were  attending The Coronas in the Olympia. Given hot cloths on arrival. Was great the twin room was ready when we arrived round 12. Walked into city centre. Huge room for 2 of us 1 double and single bed. Tea coffee making facilities in the room and cookie each. Quiet hotel no noise or banging doors at night. They organized a taxi for us to Olympia. Great the car park was free. Didn't eat here we just had room rate of 150 euro but I think breakfast should be included in that price. Lovely hotel. ,5,2016,12,11
211,What a corker.,"We stayed at the Croke Park Hotel recently whilst visiting Dublin for a surprise early 100th birthday present for my father, we have always wanted to visit Ireland and were looking for that extra little bit of luxury to make my fathers stay memorable and that is why we chose to stay at this hotel. From the moment we walked through the front doors we were made to feel so welcome, the check in staff could not have been nicer or helpful and had us booked in within minutes. The concierge approached us (christopher), and was so helpful with his knowledge and advice, and during our stay he went out of his way to make sure that we were well looked after, the second concierge, who I am afraid I did not get his name was also extremely helpful and a lovely guy. The rooms were superb, they were immaculate in presentation and overall would rate amongst the best that we have stayed in, the restaurant was very well set out and the staff were very friendly and happy to chat as well as advise regarding the menus, the sideline bar was also superb, it had a lovely airy feel to it and again the staff could not be more helpful and friendly. On reflection, we had a very enjoyable stay in Dublin with one of the highlights being our stay at the Croke Park Hotel, we would definitely stay there again in the future and recommend it to friends and family as a first class hotel to stay in.",5,2016,12,11
211,Great place to stay...,We stayed with our 2 children and it was a great time. Great service from the hotel staffs. Clean rooms and toilets. Spacious family room.. we will definitely come back to stay and recommend it to friends...,5,2016,12,10
211,Croke Park.  Great Stadium Great Hotel. ,Stayed in Croke Park Hotel recently. Food. Top Class. Staff. Very Friendly. Rooms. Excellent. Prices. Good Value. We had a very enjoyable stay. It's location is probably it's biggest assett.  Close to centre of Dublin but not in it. Don't hesitate to book it. I'll Be Back !!,4,2016,12,09
211,Nice hotel but let down by noise,"We chose the Croke Park hotel for a mini getaway as it looked like a good location and was priced well. 

The hotel was clean, spacious with friendly staff. But the rooms are poorly insulated for noise so we were woken up every night and morning - not from excessive noise but you can hear everything in the rooms and corridor around you - talking, televisions, you could even hear the room above opening curtains!

Otherwise, it was a really good stay, it's about 20 minutes walk into the city and close to local buses from the airport. Nice bar area, we only ate for breakfast one morning which was OK but quit expensive",3,2016,12,09
211,Exceeded expectations ,Booked  The Coke Park purely from reviews and competitive price and although we didn't eat here this Hotel exceeded our expectations in friendliness and hotel cleanliness. Although externally this may look like a run of the mill hotel is actually well worth a nite or two when visiting Dublin.,4,2016,12,08
211,Superb!,"We booked a deal through tour centre UK... and bagged a bargain... this is an excellent hotel... modern, clean, friendly, and not expensive at all.

We were met at reception with smiling colleagues, a hot towel to freshen up and rooms ready at 11am... great start.

Rooms, ... two double beds, huge bathroom with bath and separate shower, immaculately clean and comfortable.

Bar, well stocked, massive tv screen for sports and super service.. not expensive ...

Restaurant... Good food, well cooked and well presented. Excellent service.. Raj looked after us really well... a top guy who took the time to ensure we were very well looked after for our short stay.

20 minute walk to the centre of town, 30 mins to temple bar... or 18 euros or so In a taxi... 5 minutes max.

If not sure where to go.. speak to the concierge, really helpful.

The hotel is. Opposite the wonderful Croke park... parking on site if you need it... not sure on prices.

Top tip... don't hesitate to book this little gem! It really is excellent.",5,2016,12,05
211,Exceptional,"Fantastic Hotel, great food, great craic and customer centric staff.  Rooms were spotless and comfortable.  Staff were fun but also professional.  Night Staff were fantastic, check in check out simple.  Concierge was all one might expect.",5,2016,12,05
211,Awesome Hotel! ,"Our flight into Dublin landed at about 5 am on the day we were supposed to check in. We were unsure of what to do with our luggage so we went to the hotel to see if we could leave it there while we explored the city. The gentleman at the front desk was actually able to give us a room even though it was many hours before check-in, and he even upgraded us to an executive suite! The hotel is beautiful and very classy. Our room was clean and comfortable and had everything we needed. I have nothing but good things to say about the Croke Park and highly recommend it! ",5,2016,12,04
211,Excellent accomadation,This hotel is a very warm and welcoming hotel the entire staff were friendly and helpful and made our stay very comfortable and will always use this hotel when I visit Dublin. It is great for families as well as the family rooms are very spacious.,5,2016,12,03
211,Best service in Ireland and great hotel to stay in,"Excellent service by staff. Great communication skills, very respectful and polite staff. Even the chef behind the counter during morning breakfast buffet welcomed and had a good smile. Felt like home. Rooms are exceptionally well and comfortable. Highly recommend it for any professionals and families.",5,2016,12,03
211,"Outstanding Comfort, Value, and Convenience Just Outside the City Centre",We had a fantastic stay at this property.  The staff were outstanding. The rooms very comfortable.  Great beds and linens. Clean and stylish common areas. No two-bit charges at every turn. Excellent wi-fi. Excellent car park. If you don't mind walking a bit it's a very pleasant 30-35 minute stroll to the main tourist areas. We love to walk and enjoyed the quiet and neighborhood feel being outside the city centre. Excellent in every way. It would be out top choice on any return visit. ,5,2016,12,02
211,Expensive for what you get,"We parked in the underground car park which was a little cramped and required a little manouvering to get back out. On arrival the reception staff were very friendly. The room (no. 149) was tidy and clean but the bed had a hollow in the middle. The bar was a big let down - not much atmosphere and more like a conference room, not very homely. ",2,2016,12,01

211,Christmas shopping weekend ,"I returned to Dublin with my mum after a fantastic visit 4 years ago.

The last visit was before I had children so had a few more spare pennies. As such, I previously stayed in The Croke Park's sister hotel, The Westbury, which is one of my favourite ever hotels.

The price difference in comparison is huge, but I thought being in the same group would offer a similar standard.

I am pleased to say I wasn't wrong! The hotel staff are fantastic, rooms are clean and facilities are exactly as hoped.

The Christmas decor gives the little extra special feel for this type of visit.

The breakfast was fantastic with a great range of delicious continental & cooked items.

The highlight for me during the 2 night stay, was the attitude & helpfulness of all the staff we came into contact with. Personal cafe recommendations from the receptionist, through to the provision of maps, taxis & bottles of water for our return journey etc.

The Croke Park know how to look after their customers and I would certainly return, unless I get some extra pennies then of course I'll be back at The Westbury! 

",5,2016,11,29

211,Reasonable,"Stayed here for 2 nights - reasonable proximity to city centre - although a long walk ... taxis are a must ...,
Immediately opposite sporting stadium so imagine it will get a little noisy - we were there in off season ...
Clean rooms - good dining & bar options - a tad expensive for its amenity imo ... but that probably goes with location ...",3,2016,11,28
211,Very nice Hotel with great amenities,"Recently my wife and I spent just one night at the great Hotel, just across the road from Croke Park and just down the road from Enterprise car rentals and a short ride into Dublin by Bus or taxi. The Hotel though is really comfy , the rooms are very spacious with good beds and amenities. Hotels restaurants are just great too, good food and reasonable pricing along with some good Craic. A short ride into Dublin port if your catching a ferry. Highly recommend this Hotel.",4,2016,11,27
211,Great one night business stay,"We landed late and the staff were excellent, even met us in the car park. Rooms were lovely, no issue with leaving the car there for the next day, everyone at breakfast was really friendly as were the staff at the check out desk. ",5,2016,11,26
211,Great stay,"We stayed here for two nights in October really nice hotel with friendly helpful staff. We found the location was great for us but some people may find it a bit of a walk from the centre (about 15-20mins). The room we had was faultless with a big a comfortable bed and great bathroom.

Quite easy to get to from the airport as well, we got the aircoach using our Dublin pass and got off at Drumcondra (first stop) then a short walk of about 10mins.

We would definitely stay here again.",5,2016,11,25
211,Fantastic stay!,"Myself and my family stayed at The Croke Park Hotel and had the most fantastic time! Lovely location and hotel, the staff were excellent!

We would definitely stay here again! Up the dubs!",5,2016,11,25
211,Great Hotel with great service,"We booked the hotel on a recommendation from a friend and it didn't disappoint. The staff were always friendly and helpful. The room was large and had everything we needed including a bath (which my girlfriend appreciated after spending all day on our feet exploring). The breakfast was excellent. We tried a few other places but found that the breakfast at the hotel was value for money and good quality. The location is about 15-20 minutes walk from the centre and about 30 minutes from temple bar, on a night it was quiet and very relaxing. Would recommend to anyone staying in Dublin.",5,2016,11,25
211,Great service,"This hotel is not only a stone's throw from the famous Croke Park stadium, it is within walking distance of the city centre.  I visited the bar for food on a wet cold November day and had a great experience.  There was a long gas fire under a large TV screen and the service was outstanding.  I may have just got lucky that day but the food was excellent and the staff were so welcoming and friendly.",5,2016,11,24
211,Great cozy hotel,"We came to Dublin to explore. The location of the hotel is great, and it's easy to walk to the city center. There's a shuttle to the green hop on hop off tour bus every morning, and it makes it easy to see the whole city. The rooms are spacious and clean. The staff is very nice and helpful, and the full Irish breakfast is amazing. ",5,2016,11,22
211,What an Amazing Welcome & Service,"I spent my birthday and a conference trip at the Croke Park. As a GHA regular they upgraded me AND all my colleagues to the executive floor where we had access to a lounge and work space.
The location was great and it was easy to use local taxis to get to our destination.
I'm Gluten Free and am very intolerant, the hotel were through and friendly in sorting out a wide variety of food options - the service was super-fab!",5,2016,11,22
211,Good quality hotel..but in the middle of nowhere!,"Reasonable value for a Dublin hotel of this standard. Probably good for business users or those visiting Croke Park but as a tourist, it was too far from the centre and having spent half an hour walking all around the block, there are no good restaurants, shops or bars.",3,2016,11,22
211,Great hotel and friendly staff,"I booked this hotel through Secret Escapes so we got a discounted rate but I'd still highly recommend this hotel. The rooms were very modern and stylish. The beds were really comfy. The food was really nice. We got free vouchers for a trip round the Guinness factory, a free minibus into Dublin one night and vouchers for a free drink each. The only downside is it was a little bit outside Dublin centre too far to walk but I would definitely stay at this hotel again and would recommend it to others.",4,2016,11,21
211,Croke Park hotel,Ideally placed for conferencing at Croke Park Stadium. Good standard of rooms which were very clean. Also good service and in-house food. Convenient for airport transfers. Staff attentive without being intrusive,4,2016,11,21
211,Everything you need,"I stayed in The Croke Park Hotel for Business with several colleagues. The location is excellent, the parking comfortable and secure, staff were friendly, knowledgeable and helpful, the food (breakfast) very good.

211,Lived up to expectations yet again,"A warm welcome from Sophie at Reception set the tone for a great visit. We booked into an executive room which meant we had access on both mornings  to an excellent continental breakfast. The free glass of wine vouchers were a nice touch. The room was spacious and comfortable. As always the cleanliness and excellent housekeeping at this hotel is terrific. If I had one small niggle it was that the pillows were a bit hard and lumpy -perhaps well used- however my husband had no such complaint. We had two nights of excellent and quiet sleep. We will always return and 
advise friends to stay.",5,2016,11,20
211,Someone has really thought about this hotel,"This is a really excellent hotel. It's fresh, modern and comfortable.

Someone has thought carefully about the rooms (little things that make the difference):
- Really good sized towels
- The room had a bath and separate shower
- LOADS of storage space with lots of helpful places to put stuff
- A decent sized iron
- White Company toiletries - lovely

The breakfast was excellent too, it's really nice to have a member of staff take care of tea/coffee and toast plus a nice buffet.

Highly recommend the hotel.",5,2016,11,20
211,great location. warm welcome.,"From start to finish, we enjoyed our family trip. Warm, cosy, modern and spotlessly clean hotel. We ate in both The Sideline Bar and Bistro. The chef was very accommodating for us on the Friday evening and made up a meal for us not on the menu.Would recommend and most likely will stay again.",4,2016,11,17
211,Always Top Notch,Croke Park Hotel is conveniently located halfway between city centre and Dublin airport.  But it's more than that.  Food is way above average.  Bar is a fun place to hang out.  The staff are always always very nice and accommodating.  Highly recommend this place.,5,2016,11,17
211,45th wedding anniversary ,I booked my mum n dad in for two nights for there wedding anniversary. ...They said the hotel was fantastic friendly .clean.and top class ..food was fantastic. .The hotel made them feel special with a complementary bottle of bubbly and card in there room ...They would highly recommend this hotel 😊😊,5,2016,11,16
211,Best Hotel for value in Dubin,"For business purposes The Croke Park is hard to beat. Excellent Staff, food terrific,  Internet excellent and withing ten minutes walk of the centre of the city.

Great value for money, would expect to pay twice the price.. A hidden gem . Top class and great rooms. ",5,2016,11,16
211,Aer Lingus package,"We got into the  Croke as part of an Aer Lingus vacation package.  It was the fourth hotel on our itinerary and like the other three hotels it was a pleasant experience.  The hotel was clean, the rooms were fresh and big enough. The bed was comfortable.  We were surprised to find that we had a room in the executive floor which gave us access to the executive lounge too.  The hotel was surprisingly closer to the down town than we expected.  It was only a 15 minute walk to Henry street.  The staff was very friendly . We had a chuckle among ourselves as the concierge would present himself immediately as soon as he suspected that we might have a question.  The included breakfast was delicious and more than adequate.  ",5,2016,11,16
211,"Friendly, helpful staff and good food","I was lodged in this hotel by the organisers of the conference I was speaking at.  I am so glad that they did.  Not only was it very handy for the conference, which was held at the sports stadium across the road, but, despite being big the hotel was warm and friendly.
My best example of this was on the morning I left, at 04:30 as I had an early flight to catch. Not only were they friendly, but I was also offered a complimentary bottle of water to drink on my way to the airport - because of course I had drunk nothing since getting up.  What a nice thoughtful touch.  It is little things like that that make this place special.  I hope to return again, and have more time to explore the city.",5,2016,11,15
211,Long weekend in Dublin,"Chose Croke Park hotel based on reviews and website appeal.....what a place!

I am a seasoned traveler and a fair reviewer, i understand that perfect can be hard to achieve and sometimes the little things you have to overlook; at Croke Park there are no compromises.

From the hotel towel and warm welcome at check in to the pleasant and cheerful nature of all the staff I would say there could be few better places to base yourself while in this wonderful city.

We chose a more expensive deluxe room on the 4th floor with breakfast and use of the executive lounge; this was an excellent decision. Regardless of role; all the staff were accommodating and friendly no one passed you without a hello.

Breakfast was ample and provided excellent choice (try the white pudding it was a triumph). We chose to eat in the restaurant on our last night and the feed was too draw (can highly recommend the steak).

The location was perfect for us; a taxi into/from the city ranged from 7€ (daytime) to 15€ late Saturday night. You can get a bus from around the corner for 2€ each. Taxi back to the airport was 20€.

When I come back to Dublin I won't bother looking for another place to stay; I would be amazed if I could find anywhere better than Croke Park (also good value at £365 for 3 nights in a top rated room!)

",5,2016,11,15
211,"Great Room, Great Hotel","We had a great room, with large bath.  The bed was very comfortable, the bathroom was huge and everything was spotlessly clean.  Enjoyed the breakfast very much.  This was a great place for us to stay as we had an early departure for the airport and getting to the airport was easy from this location.  The staff were all great, very helpful.  We had a great dinner recommendation for  a local pub from one of the staff.  The pub was within walking distance and it was a highlight.",5,2016,11,14
211,Weekend with the family,"Spent 2 nights with my wife, 3 kids and my mother and father. Had two family rooms and the space in both was brillant. 
This is a modern, fairly new hotel. 
What can I say, great hotel, good food, nice location within easy access to Dublin centre and ultra friendly staff. ",4,2016,11,13
211,Pleased with everything,"We stayed one night for a conference. Good modern rooms, a quiet sleep, a good breakfast.
In our opinion, the lobby decor and art could do with a makeover, but that does not influence our happy rating.
I am particularly glad to see that they know to provide warm plates for the hot breakfast buffet. Even many five-star hotels don't know how to serve hot food and provide cold plates so that the food is cold when you get to table. And it's also nice to see real comb honey on offer.
The group dinner that night was in a VERY noisy room, very hard to hear others at the table.",4,2016,11,12
211,Great Service Clean Rooms Equals Great Stays,Very impressed with this hotel. They staff is very efficient and professional. Rooms were immaculately clean. The concierge was helpful in helping us get our hop on hop off tours bus tickets. The maid service is some of the best i have seen in my travels. Checkout was quick and easy and they got is a taxi that cane quickly. Taxi fare from airport is 25 to 30 € depending on traffic. The hotel is a 10 to 15 minute walk from O'Connell Street (main street with all the stores)  just turn right when u exit hotel and walk a few blocks. Recommend staying at this location if you are looking for clean friendly and decent priced hotel,5,2016,11,10
211,A very good visit,"My son and I stayed for only one night when we attended a convention.  We chose the hotel because of its proximity to croake park and booked several weeks in advance.
On arrival we were warmly greeted at the reception desk and felt welcomed.  We were given our room keys without delay.
The room was very clean and tidy with one double and one single.  I had actually thought the room was to be two doubles but it didn't cause any inconvenience. There was a good selection of toiletries.  It was also useful to have tea facilities.  There was a large selection of herbal teas but only a few tea and coffees. The room maintained a good temperature at night and was quiet.
When we checked out I asked if I could leave our bags and found that this was allowed which was extremely helpful.
We enjoyed our stay and were overall satisfied.  The staff we met were polite and friendly. The only disappointment was the price of the breakfast which I thought was quite expensive considering the price we had already paid for the room. 
I would definitely recommend the hotel to family and friends and would stay there again.",4,2016,11,09
211,Outstanding Staff and Beautiful Hotel,"Stayed for one night at this hotel and had a wonderful experience. I was attending an event in Croke Park with a friend, so the location was perfect - right across the road. Beforehand I had emailed a number of times and always received a quick response. At the hotel, the room was lovely , however it was the staff that really made the visit for me. The receptionists were incredibly helpful and easy to talk to, as well as the concierge. I was very impressed by the luggage room, which I was able to leave my bags in after check out to collect later. The only problem I had was the key cards not working in the elevator, but this was quickly sorted at reception. Overall, the staff made me feel welcome and made my stay very enjoyable.",5,2016,11,09
211,Lovely Hotel and yummy food,"We stayed  in this hotel for 3 nights and had booked a family room (3 kids). As other reviewers have already pointed out the location is a bit out of the way but taxis and buses are readily available. We had a car so location wasn't an issue.

The staff were very welcoming and very attentive towards us. We had dinner on 2 of the nights and each time the food and its quality were delicious. 

The room itself was quite comfortable and had a lovely big bathroom. There was plenty of choice at breakfast. The staff offered us pancakes and hot chocolate for the kids which was a nice touch.

We very extremely happy with our stay and would gladly return.",5,2016,11,09
211,So accommodating,"Short trip for a wedding anniversary.  The hotel granted us access to the executive lounge and wine in our room as a freebie.
The hotel itself is a delight, with high standards of accommodation, a decent restaurant and excellent service.
The best I have experienced in Dublin 
",5,2016,11,08
211,Would definitely stay again. ,"We stayed at this hotel for three nights with our 3 year old son. The staff were very welcoming and were very attentive towards our son. 
The room was comfortable and had a lovely big bathroom. 
There was plenty of choice at breakfast. We ordered pancakes for our son on the last morning and a lot of effort had gone into the presentation. 
We had stayed in the city before and found it too noisy. The Croke Park is in a quieter location but only takes 15-20 mins to walk into the city. The city tour bus does stop outside the hotel and there is a public bus stop a 5 minute walk away. ",4,2016,11,08
211,Croke Park Hotel Stay,"I stayed at this hotel for one night in October, 2016.  The hotel is very nice, and the room was large and spacious.  Staff was very friendly and knowledgeable.  If I had been in Dublin another night, I would have stayed at this hotel.  Highly recommend this hotel.",5,2016,11,07
211,"Nice, reasonably priced hotel with a below average location.","Pros

Nice hotel, big room and bathroom
Reasonably priced
Closer to airport than hotels in the city center
10-15 minute walk to O'Connell Street

Cons

Weird, remote feeling location across from Croke Park stadium
Not a lot of places to eat/drink in the immediate vicinity",4,2016,11,07
211,"Lovely hotel, great staff, yummy food.","I stayed at The Croke Park for an event last month. My only complaint is that I didn't book a longer stay. My flight from Philadelphia arrived at the crack of dawn (a/k/a 7am). I emailed to let the hotel know I'd be in early, but they were fully booked and didn't have a room available when I arrived. What could have been a nightmare (I don't sleep on planes) turned into a delightful experience. They stored my suitcase, and I parked myself in the bar with a pot of tea and a delicious breakfast sandwich. I had power for my laptop, and free wifi. I was set to wait as long as needed, which wasn't long. My room was ready in 90 minutes, and it was clean and comfortable and I slept like a baby for a few hours. The Croke Park isn't centrally located, but it was central enough for my needs. If you're going for a sports event, it is directly across the road from the Croke Park Stadium. Guinness, Temple Bar, etc are a short taxi ride away, and the hop-on-hop-off bus stops right in front of the hotel. All-in-all, it was a lovely place to stay and I hope to go back soon.",5,2016,11,05
211,Second Stay Here,"This was our second time here and we were so well looked after. We booked 2 nights with a deluxe upgrade and the little extras made our stay so memorable. We come to Ireland often and will definitely make this our go-to stop each time we come to the city. Great service, great food, fantastic rooms and location.",5,2016,11,05
211,Not impressed this time...beware!,"We arrived a few days ago at the Croke Park Hotel shortly after 11am to have a late breakfast whereupon we ordered small cooked breakfasts as we had done just as before on previous visits.
This time however we were kept waiting 35 minutes (after ordering) when I had to ask what was keeping our orders. When the breakfast was eventually served, it arrived with all sorts of extra trimmings and extra portions which we simply had not ordered. When we put this to the waitress, she claimed that a late breakfast must include all the trimmings! 
I feel that this was a case of the chef deciding what our orders should be rather than our own preferential choices. It all came at a hefty enough price, certainly the most expensive breakfast I've ever had. 
The hotel needs to make very clear to customers that a late breakfast comes literally with everything in double portions. Ourselves who have visited regularly in the past now feel swindled and cheated at what we had to pay.
The breakfast and this hotel has left quite a stale taste in the mouth...",3,2016,11,04
211,Excellent customer service exceedingall expectations above and beyond the norm,We booked into the Croke Park hotel for 2 nights as my husband had an early hospital  appointment . We attended the day unit as planned but my husband had to stay in hospital and had emergency open heart surgery. I  had to contact Croke Park  as my car was parked at the hotel. The manager Catherine kindly offered that I could keep my car parked at the hotel as I was staying in the hospital during this stressful period. All the hotel staff displayed outstanding levels of service both face to face and on the telephone during my visits to the hotel during this period.,5,2016,11,03
211,Extemely attentive service in excellent location,"Excellent hotel. Staff were extremely friendly and attentive throughout our stay. The location is convenient for the airport, and includes free parking. Also close to the city. Overall couldn't have asked for more.",5,2016,11,02
211,Heaven,"Really lovely hotel very clean and modern with really helpful staff wouldn't hesitate to go back.
They have a separate lounge on fourth floor for use of people staying on that floor that provides free continental breakfast that you can help yourself to as much as you want. This lounge can be used 24 hrs a day providing free tea,coffee, bottled water and bottled orange and apple juice. ",5,2016,11,02
211,Hard to fault,"The Croke Park Hotel is a hotel well worth a visit. It's practical, well attired and its staff are really helpful and friendly. The one thing that did impress me was the fact that parking was free. I had always taken this for granted but it seems that it's not always the case in Dublin. Staff were helpful and food was good. All in all a great stay especially if you're planning a visit to the magnificent Croke Park stadium.",5,2016,11,02
211,Nice room great pillows,"No view but the room was large, comfortable, and  pants presser. Had an extra little room that a bed would fit.  Large bathroom excellent shower with powerful  stream.Television well situated with writing desk.",5,2016,11,01
211,Second Stay,"As I start all reviews, please take a look and see how many hotels I've reviewed, I'm not a jaded one time traveler. I travel often and feel I have a good base to write a good overall review. This was our second stay at this hotel. 
It's in a fairly residential area which I liked. It's in my opinion walk-able to the city center. ( some would disagree) We were told by our driver we wouldn't want to be walking around the area after dark. I didn't see anything shady but who knows. 
Our last visit was 6 years ago and the property has been maintained very well. Honestly I was very shocked by how nice it still was. Check in was a breeze, Sophia at the front was AMAZING! Welcomed us like we were family. Truly a great welcome and wonderful room. 
We did encounter an issue with the package we purchased. It came with 2 - ""house cocktails"" we presented these vouchers at the bar, ordered a drink and when the bill came he told us we couldn't use it on the drinks we ordered. I simply asked why he didn't say what drinks we could use it on and his response was "" I don't know what house cocktails are"" we paid the tab and I just wanted to make the front desk was aware of this issue (please keep in mind I didn't see this as a huge issue nor was I throwing any attitude, we even tipped the waiter) the receptionist was great at the front she got the night manger. She came She explained that the voucher was for a ""house cocktail"" and when I asked ""whats a house cocktail?"" was she said ""I don't know"". She then went to the backroom and this is where the whole situation became odd. The ""assistant f&b manager"" came to the front with what was clearly a chip on his shoulder. He started banging on the keyboard clearly mad. Keep in mind I didn't ask for anything I was just bringing this confusion to their attention. Both the receptionist and night hotel manager could see this man was acting like a fool and assured me the issue would be rectified and I could go back to my room. 
Overall this ruined the evening. We actually were going to stay another night and decided to keep to our original plan and leave the next morning. Would I stay here again? Yes. It's a nice hotel and amazing prices. Overall the staff with the exception of this one guy was outstanding.  Safe travels Cheers!",4,2016,11,01
211,Comfortable,"Stayed for 4 very pleasant nights.  All the Staff were so helpful and well informed.  The bedroom was very comfortable and well maintained.  Good Wi-Fi connectivity.  Parking is free for hotel residents.  Really enjoyed the Breakfasts, especially the honey scooped from a boxed comb.  Overall, good value for money.",5,2016,11,01
211,Area let's this hotel down,"We stayed here while holidaying in Ireland,great hotel staff very helpful,room was clean,lovely size bathroom.  The hotel has a lovely library with a cosy fire.
The biggest disappointment  was the area, felt very run down,dirty, did not feel safe walking in Croke Park.",5,2016,11,01
211,Good with gaps,"Lovely hotel and we like to walk so the 15 mins into town a pleasure. Christopher on reception a super man, helped us out and really knowledgeable. The breakfast was the gap for us, the cooked elements could have been better quality for a hotel at this price. Fried eggs rubber and dried up, tinned mushrooms, sausages and bacon not good meat.",4,2016,10,30
211,Weekend stay/great hotel.,"Stayed for a few nights either side of a stag do with a couple of mates and only have positive comments - great triple room and facilities, good restaurant/bar where we watched the England and Wales Euro 2016 game and very friendly staff. Made use of a coffee/tea chill out sort of room on a higher floor which was included and made use of the room service. We just jumped on a bus for a short ride to the city although we also walked it as the weather was fine. Would stay again and would recommend to others.",5,2016,10,30
211,A Safe haven,"Croke is a comfortable place with a great deal of friendliness.  Staying here made our holiday relaxing.
The breakfast offered is for a King or Queen starting with the food and completed by the friendly service we received.",5,2016,10,29
211,Exquisite stay in Dublin,"The Croke Park Hotel is marvelous. We had a fourth floor room, which gives access to the executive lounge; a wonderful bonus. Quiet, clean, and up-to-date. All the amenities, great price, and so quiet.",5,2016,10,29
211,Loved the Croke Park-Dublin,"We loved staying at the Croke Park.  It was very nice and modern.  Had a cheeseburger in their bar and it was amazing.  The staff were very, very accommodating and friendly.  Secure parking garage under hotel.",5,2016,10,28
211,Fabulous hotel - loved every minute,"Absolutely fabulous hotel - the room was spot on, delicious food, attentive staff. Booked for our mini-moon after the lowcostholidays farce cheated us out of our original hotel booking, but they honestly did us a favour, as I was delighted with our stay. We wanted to take the bed home with us as had some of the best night's sleep in a long time!",5,2016,10,28
211,Excellent hotel ,"Top quality stay. Three nights in a family room for our city break. Room facilities can't be faulted, plenty of space for the four of us. Worth taking out the breakfast option, amongst the best buffet type ones we've had, attentive staff and the kitchen takes special orders too. Reception team were very helpful as were the concierges. Admittedly the hotel isn't in the city centre but only five - ten minute walk to a bus stop and train station. Recommended.",5,2016,10,28
211,Top Quality Hotel in Dublin,"Three night stay for a family trip to Dublin. Can't fault the hotel, rooms, food or service. Excellent  value for money for a quality hotel. A bit out of the city center but perfectly walkable (about 15 min to O'Connell Street).   ",5,2016,10,27
211,Great hotel,"Very nice hotel with great staff. There were a lot of Americans at the hotel. Also there was no event at Croke Park so it was quiet. If you want to be in the heart of it, this hotel may not be the best. However, it is a nice walk away from Temple Bar and a good walk to the Botanical Gardens.",5,2016,10,26
211,Milomoney111,"This is my second stay at the Croke park hotel. From the moment you enter you're made feel welcome and the hotel is excellent all round.  Large rooms, large well stocked bathroom. The rooms are very quiet and the curtains really keep out the early sunlight if you like a lie in. It's hard to believe you're in a built up area while in your room.  
The area isn't great at night time but there's an abundance of taxis and the staff will call one for you if required.  I've stayed around Dublin quite a lot this year but have decided after my last stay at the Croke pk hotel I'll never stay anywhere other than here.
Well done to all the staff and management.  ",5,2016,10,26
211,Decent Accommodation in Dublin,"We stayed here for 4 days during a conference. This is a decent accommodation just near famous croke park stadium. City Center is just 10 mins from here. hotel can arrange day tour (Hop on Hop off) in 17 euro normal price is 19 euro. 
Room was very clean and comfortable; all necessary amenities  were present.  bathroom was of good size in fact bigger than so many I have come across in various countries of similar level. Breakfast was good but never changed in those 4 days, only black pudding, boiled and fried eggs, hash brown, half tomatoes, mushrooms, pork sausage, breakfast cereals and canned juice/ tea coffee. though it seems very good breakfast but we expect some variation at least in alternative day for 4 star hotel. Staffs were polite.  We did not eat anything other than breakfast so can not say about other meal. Lobby , bar and restaurant seem impressive. This is not a budget hotel but spending few bucks won't  regretting. I highly recommend this hotel.",4,2016,10,26
211,2 night stay at Croke Park,"Croke Park is lovely hotel with fantastic staff and great transport links as well as being located at one of Dublins most iconic venues. 

The hotel has a lovely atmosphere and some really nice areas to sit and enjoy a bite to eat , a coffee break or just a drink in the bar. The rooms are a really good size, very comfortable beds, good size bathrooms with white company toiletries, tea and coffee facilities, a fresh fruit plate in your room on arrival and bathrobes and slippers for extra comfort. They also operate a turn down service complete with chocolates on your bed. 

What sets this hotel apart from the rest is the staff - they really are a credit to the hotel and can not do enough for you. From the minute you arrive there is someone to greet you at the door as you get out of your taxi and carry your luggage to reception for you and the check in staff are friendly and efficient always with a smile on their faces. 

A great hotel for business and leisure travelers alike!",5,2016,10,25
211,Lovely hotel just outside the city centre,"We've just stayed here for a long weekend whilst visiting Dublin. It's a lovely hotel and we'd definitely stay here again. The staff were great, very friendly and helpful. 

We were given a room on the 4th floor which meant we had access to the executive lounge for drinks and snacks which was handy. On arrival there were two mini bottles of prosecco in our room as we were celebrating an anniversary which was a really nice touch. 

The rooms were really clean and well kept and had white company toiletries in and a turn down service in the evening. The bed was the most comfortable we've ever had in a hotel, great after a long day of sight seeing! A great shower too. 

We were a bit concerned the hotel would be too far out after reading some reviews but it was only a short walk (10-15mins) from the centre. We also used the hop on hop off bus most days to get into the centre and see the sights.  It was between €8-10 for a taxi back from the temple bar area. 

The breakfast was nice enough but we were expecting a slightly higher quality given the standard of the rest of the hotel. 

On our last evening we ate in the Sideline Bistro. Again it was nice enough but not as good as we were expecting. It looked the part but lacked on flavour. The white chocolate and Bailey's cheesecake was disappointing. It was more of a white chocolate ganache in a bowl with a few biscuit crumbs at the bottom.  If you don't want to venture too far for an evening meal we'd recommend the Italian a 2 min walk away. 

In summary, a great hotel that's good value for money a short distance away from the hustle and bustle. ",4,2016,10,24
211,"Lovely hotel, Friendly staff"," I stayed with 2 friends on Sat 22/10/16 as we were heading to The Commitments"" in the Bord Gais Theatre. On arrival at hotel the staff could not have been nicer. We asked for a Taxi to be booked for 4.30 and it arrived dead on time. As we had travelled from Cavan and wanted to do a little shopping on Sunday leaving our Suitcases was absolutely no problem. We arrived back Sunday had a couple of drinks and some bar food, which was lovely and the young girl serving us was a ""little lady"". I/ We would definitely stay there again.",4,2016,10,24
211,Once again...first class stay at Croke Park Hotel,"My wife, daughter & I stayed for 2 nights at the Croke park hotel. This is our 4th time returning to stay at the hotel. The room as large, spacious, spotless and had a balcony. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay as we enjoyed the superb food, comfortable bed and the  welcoming friendly staff. We ate in the bar each evenimng, the steak was to die for..as were the ongion rings! Table service in the bar was excellent and the bar staff were very friendly, efficent and professional. We would highly recommend the Croke park hotel for any stay in Dublin.",5,2016,10,23
211,Lovely stay,"This was the last place we stayed on our trip to Ireland, and it was one of the best. It's a shame it was only for one night. The staff was friendly and helpful. The hotel was lovely with clean rooms and only a 15-20 minute walk to centre. Lovely end to our time in Ireland.",5,2016,10,23

211,Great hotel ,"The staff are very nice and friendly. The food at the restaurant is excellent. Very clean hotel and it is only 10 minutes from all the shopes in center city and temple bar area. Even though I travel for business whenever I am in Dublin I stay at this hotel and they are very consistent. Love it here.

211,It's the little things!,"The Croke Park has everything I want to find in a hotel room - a proper hairdryer, sockets beside the bed, plenty of space in the bathroom for all my bits and pieces, good wifi, sports channels on the tv and more! One thing I really liked was finding herbal teas and hot chocolate as well as the traditional tea and coffee options in my room - as a non-tea/coffee drinker, it was lovely to find something I could drink, and this is very rare!! Breakfast was also excellent, with a wide choice and something to suit everyone. The bed was really comfortable, and the room, while not huge, was clean and beautifully decorated. And of course, there was the view of Croke Park right outside my window!!!",5,2016,10,22
211,Almost perfection 😀,"I can't speak highly enough about this hotel , star quality from entering to the room and beyond . Beyond scrumptious rooms , lovely food , memorable attention to detail . 

The staff could not be friendlier , attentive and caring . Surprise proseco in our room on our arrival back after shopping . 

Will definetly come back .",5,2016,10,22
211,Great Hotel ,"Bought my friend here for her 50th Birthday, great location 15 minute walk to centre, hotel was quiet at night, room was love very spacious and very clean, two double beds and the usual amenities, the bathroom was the best I have seen in a hotel big bath separate walk in shower, toiletries supplied which was a nice touch. We had the Irish breakfast both mornings if you purchased vouchers before it was €12 instead of €14.95 breakfast was very nice and plentiful all the usual hot things plus if you wanted omelettes or pancakes these were cooked for you, liked having the toast bought to us instead of using toast machines that either burnt the toast or warm it! 

Staff friendly we went to the bar one night thought it was quite expensive for drinks but hotels normally are. Check out was smooth given bottled water for our journey home, staff very professional and approachable. Would definitely return to this hotel and it is highly recommended. ",5,2016,10,22
211,"Very comfortable, great staff","This would be described, I suppose, as a business-style hotel on the north side of Dublin, not far from the city centre (but far enough - 10 minutes by car/taxi in light traffic). In the interests of full disclosure, this room was booked and paid for by a 3rd party for as part of a business trip so I can't really say how it compares price-wise to other hotels, although it seems that - at the moment at least - hotel prices in Dublin are sky-high so this is unlikely to be overpriced in that context.

The room was lovely - clean, comfortable and spacious. It had a proper shower, not the bath+shower some older places still have, so that's a definite plus. It was quiet too, which I certainly appreciate.

I had drinks and bar food with a friend in the large downstairs bar area - it's perhaps a little soulless but at the same time quite comfortable and a pleasant couple of hours were passed. The wine and bar food (sandwiches) were of a good quality.

The hotel has its own underground car park free to residents, so that's also a big plus.

The breakfast was excellent - the usual breakfast fare but to a very high standard, easily one of the best I've had.

The hotel staff were friendly and helpful and helped make the stay as pleasant as possible.",4,2016,10,21
211,Best hotel in Dublin!,"Whenever we want a night of luxury this is where we always stay. The location is not a big issue as we know Dublin very well so it took about 20 minutes walk to the centre. 

The interior of the rooms are of the highest standard and the staff are helpful and friendly. We've stayed here on a couple of occasions with the latest being in a top floor superior room. Would definitely recommend this option. Included a light breakfast, lovely views, free chocolates and a free drink down in the bar each. No noise from other rooms or corridors in the night. Great TV and facilities in the room. 

You really get what you pay for and more with this hotel so I would recommend to all looking for a night or two of luxury and comfort to stay here.",5,2016,10,21
211,"I just did not have the ""wow!"" feeling","A stayed here for 4 night for business reasons. The Hotel was OK, rooms were clean. Only complaint I had is because of the bed: they had castors, so working from the bed (or watching TV) I faced the situation that the bed rolls out.
Restaurant is a different story, I will give my review separately...",3,2016,10,21
211,Very Good Stay,"Uneventful stay in very good hotel. Everything ran smoothly from check in to check out. 
Room was very large and bathroom good size all very clean. As it was business trip I found myself working in the room which had plenty of desk space and strong WiFi.
One odd thing was the placement of the TV was facing slightly away from the bed!
Room service was very good and quickly delivered. Breakfast had a good selection - neat way they served the honey :)
Although I did not get a moment in the bar to watch the TV, the TV appeared to be huge",4,2016,10,20
211,Fabulous stay when visiting Dublin,"I was pleasantly suprised at the overall exterior and internal decor. The Reception staff were amazingly helpful and courteous, excellent customer service. The room we were allocated had a double and a single bed in. A quick call to reception asking for a king size bed was actioned immediately. The rooms are lovely and also very clean. Just one thing to point out, it is across the road from the stadium, which could be a good or bad thing. Situated by the Royal Canal, it is 1.3 Km from the city centre. You can ring for uber taxis which are plentiful and the Temple Bar area is buzzing and has the Irish vibrancy one would expect.  You will not be disappointed with Hotel and location",5,2016,10,20
211,Great visit,"Our visit for a few days in Dublin taking in a concert at 3 arena was a pleasure from start to finish. Lovely staff throughout the hotel from the reception desk on. Great food, and lovely room. We will be back again. ",5,2016,10,19
211,Professional and friendly service,"We are a family of two adults and two children who enjoyed the professional and friendly service at the Croke Park Hotel. The reception was very efficient, and they helped our stay run smoothly. 
The breakfast selection was plentiful. The quality of the room was good; it was quiet and the beds were comfortable. 
We took a taxi to the main shopping street (Grafton St.) from the hotel and it cost us 11 euro (non-rush hour). We also rented a car and used the free secure parking, no problem finding a space.
We will recommend this hotel to our friends, for price and value. One more compliment, the Guinness at the bar was smooth and perfect.",5,2016,10,19
211,Luck Of The (Non)-Irish,"We booked this hotel as our first stay in Ireland without realizing that the GAA Championships were the day after we were leaving. As a result, our luck in staying here could not have been better, as it informed the entire rest of our trip! The hotel itself is clean and modern, and is located directly across from the Croke Park Stadium. We were given spot on tips from the concierge regarding pubs & restaurants in the area. The restaurant was quite good, and the servers were understanding & sympathetic when one of us wasn't feeling well enough to eat the first night there after ordering dinner. The bar is quite large and fun, with an outstanding fireplace and plenty of room to sit and read and/or people-watch. We were on the 4th (Executive) floor, and thus had access to an Executive Suite with 24 hour snacks (including fruit) and tea & coffee and in the morning, breakfast items. We were also given coupons for a free drink in the bar for each night we were there, which was a lovely touch. The room itself was large and the bed & pillows extremely comfortable. The bathroom had a separate shower and bathtub, which is a rare find in a hotel. The hotel is a bit of a walk to town/shopping areas (about 15-20 minutes) but we made the walk several times, including at night, and weren't bothered by it. We also walked from Glasnevin back to the hotel. My one complaint would be that the hotel couldn't supply us with aspirin, and sent us to a local store several blocks away to get some.",5,2016,10,18
211,First Night in Dublin,"The Croke Hotel was a splendid accommodation for our first night in Dublin. The helpful staff, fabulous Full Irish Breakfast,and the spacious room made this tired traveler feel cared for after a long flight. Security was excellent and the ease of finding taxi service made the day and evening a real treat. Highly recommending this hotel.",5,2016,10,18
211,"Large, modern hotel","Typical large hotel.  They were accomodating and let us check into our room very early (by 9am).  I paid extra (for a deluxe room) to have a breakfast included and was not impressed.  It was all cold, continental food; what would normally come included in a stay at an American hotel.",3,2016,10,17
211,Very Positive Stay,"Room 215 featured a queen and twin bed. Across from Croke Park Stadium and 20 minutes from the Dublin Airport.  Room very clean top to bottom.  Bathroom has washcloths!  Has tub and separate shower.  Controlled thermostat with A/C that emits a nice little fan sound all the time.  Bed(s) cozy and slept well.  Only had breakfast, but it was an impressive with all the variety.  The staff we interfaced with were quite nice.",4,2016,10,14
211,Conference,"Arrived after a tiring travel covering trains, car and flight and was quickly checked  in and was soon in my room. As you can see the room is finished to a very high standard with a brilliant view of Croke Park, the home of Gaelic football worldwide.",5,2016,10,13
211,Business hotel with family feelings,"We stayed at this hotel for 4 nights, had a good family room and really enjoyed our stay. It's quite a large hotel so it feels like you are in another chain hotel with an important difference and that is the really nice and friendly mainly Irish staff, the great food and fantastic breakfast. We stayed there as a family and the kids are 6 and 9 and it was our first city trip. The kids had so much for breakfast every morning that I thought they would explode. At home they would eat one toast, but here they had the full English breakfast, fresh fruit etc. The hotel is just a tiny bit out of the city Centre but it was an easy walk for us, 15 minutes with kids and after a good breakfast needed. We spent our days around the city and in the evening we were all so tired that we just had dinner in the hotel. They have a really great and good kids menue with lots of choice and it's really good food! Nothing from the freezer. And for us parents the food was als really nice, whether a sandwich from the bar or a risotto or the lamb, all really tasty.  And nice to have a Guinness and then just go to the room to bed. By the way a cab would cost you around 10 euros to the city center and around 20 to the airport and around 12 € to the zoo. All depending on traffic. So if I could give 4,5 stars I would!",4,2016,10,13
211,Great experience,"Modern hotel with very helpful staff.  Phillip at reception was outstanding and made our stay most pleasant.  Another staff member helped us figure out something with our rental car. The furnishings are updated and the bed/pillows were the most comfortable on our 10 night trip to Ireland!  The location is not scenic, but we found it easy to get in and out of.  Overall, it was a very nice experience.  Would highly recommend!",5,2016,10,12
211,Very nice hotel,"The Croke Park is a very nice hotel.  The rooms are clean and modern with nice upgrades.  The beds are comfortable as are the pillows. If you are attending an event at the stadium, the location is directly across the street--there could not be a better location.  If you aren't attending an event, you are away from the center of Dublin, with little to do in the area.  The restaurant serves excellent dinner and breakfast.  The bar is a nice place to have a beverage.  My room overlooked railroad tracks, but I didn't hear any trains, so I don't know if any run past the hotel.  The staff in all areas of the hotel were excellent, friendly and helpful.",4,2016,10,10
211,Amazing,I stayed here for a weekend with my boyfriend .The staff are friendly.The rooms are big and the king size bed is very comfortable. The food is lovely. We really enjoyed our stay.We will definitely be back,5,2016,10,10
211,Great hotel - Location not so good if you're here on a city sightseeing break.,"As someone who's well travelled with high standards for accommodation, I can't fault the rooms, cleanliness or staff at The Croke Park. What I loved - Check-in was easy, staff were friendly and very accommodating and the entire hotel looks classy from the highly polished floors, to the light fittings and scented candles that welcome you as you enter. Having a separate bath and shower is great, for those of us that suffer with back/arthritis problems, where most hotels make you climb in and out, and risk life and limb, of the bath to try and shower with a shower curtain sticking to you. The rooms were well appointed and modern. Breakfast had a great range and the croissants were, in the words of my French mother, better than actual French croissants. What I wasn't so happy with - The Sideline Bistro had a fairly limited menu, even more limited for a vegetarian, I struggled to find anything I liked from the menu and certainly couldn't eat here for a few nights. Their breakfast coffee was noticeably bitter, even asking for a weak latte I struggled to drink it. The room mini bar wasn't stocked, not even with a bottle of water, which after a long day sightseeing, would have been nice. Not sure why a mini bar is listed, or provided, if you're not going to provide a range of chargeable drinks or snacks. A bottle of water from the bar was expensive, so we had to resort to buying large bottles from the city centre to bring back with us - which leads nicely to my final point. This hotel is perfectly located for attendees at Croke Park Stadium - which is why I booked it for four nights, as I was taking part in an author signing on the Saturday with heavy kit to carry there on the day - The hotel is right opposite it, but it's a good 15-20 minute walk from Temple Bar/Grafton Street and through some areas that I didn't feel that comfortable walking alone during the day - I certainly wouldn't have considered it at night, even with a male partner in tow. For a hotel of this standard, in the location it is, I would have expected at least a complimentary hourly shuttle bus service to the city centre, even a bookable/payable service to and from the airport. Much as I loved the hotel itself, I wouldn't return if I came back to Dublin, purely based on the location and how much extra we had to spend in taxis to feel safe at night.",4,2016,10,10
211,Good spot,"Excellent location and facility.  Relatively expensive option.  Rooms, bar, food etc all top class. If attending meeting in the Stadium, couldn't be better.  Would definitely recommend the hotel if its within your budget.",5,2016,10,10
211,Nice smart hotel,"Nice hotel clean and smart a little outside the main centre but with a shuttle bus each morning to take you right in. Breakfast good Buffett style staff friendly and concierge especially so.
Stayed on executive floor with communal lounge for free coffee and tea with light snaks.",5,2016,10,09
211,Good service in Dublin,"I liked the quality of service in the Crock Park hotel. Rooms are pleasant, clean, free wifi. Bar is active every evening, breakfast very good but busy. The only low part - it is not walking distance from city centre.",4,2016,10,08
211,Good Business Base,"This hotel is very central and well equipped for the business traveller. The lounge on the fourth floor is an ideal work base, well stocked with coffee, water and fruit. Rooms are well appointed and comfortable. The hotel is close to Connolly but really walking distance.",4,2016,10,08
211,Short stay but enjoyable,Stayed at the Croke Park hotel late September 2016.  We were part of a CIE Jewels of Ireland Tour.  This was the last stop on our tour.  The hotel is located opposite the Croke Park Stadium where the finals of the footy was held the week before.  This weekend the ladies finals were being played.  Dublin centre is about a 15minute walk away.  The hotel restaurant served a good breakfast and we had a light dinner also at the hotel.  The staff at the front desk were great and so was the concierge desk.  All very helpful. Our only complaint which is small is that we were staying in room 145 on the first floor and on exiting the lift one sign said our room was one way and the other sign on this floor didn't even mention where to go.  Spent quite a few minutes locating the room.  On approaching the desk for a reason for this omission the front desk acknowledged the problem and said new signs were being made.  Overall a well located hotel.  Clean and comfortable.,5,2016,10,08
211,Perfectly located for games at the stadium; otherwise not a great location,"As a caveat, we stayed at Croke Park after three nights at its sister hotel in Cork, which we found to be wonderful. Croke Park itself was a perfectly nice hotel with great service and pleasant amenities, but it was about a 20- to 30-minute walk from all the tourist attractions in Dublin. We probably should've done better research on the location itself. 

Check-in was great and very friendly. Like in the hotel in Cork, we reserved a suite. This suite was a letdown from our Cork room, which was spacious, bright, modern and with a beautiful view. We understood that we are now in Dublin, but it was still a disappointment. Our view was of an empty lot that made the location seem unsafer than it probably was. 

Beds were comfortable with nightly turndown service with chocolate. 

Breakfast was complimentary, which is always a great perk. It was fine. We also got access to a room with complimentary snacks and bottled water, which we loved! We actually ate breakfast in this room instead of the dining room. Coffee was horrible at the hotel, so I would get my caffeine in town. The hotel also gave us a nightly beer or wine, which served as a nice nightcap after exploring Dublin.

The gym was small and half of the cardio machines (there were four in total) were broken at the time. Don't know how long they've been broken. Bottled water and fruit was also available in the gym. 

Probably an ideal hotel for someone watching a game at the Stadium across the street or tourists who don't want to be near the hubbub of downtown. I know the red tourist bus would stop by the hotel, so you could always ride that if you wanted to circumvent the walk.",3,2016,10,05
211,Remarkable Experience,"On our recent trip to Ireland, we were celebrating a special anniversary.  This great hotel in Dublin couldn't have done anything to make our stay more enjoyable and the little extras were really appreciated.  Overall, the staff were so friendly, check-in was easy, the room was very comfortable in every way and the full Irish breakfast was over the top. We only wish that we could've stayed longer.  We highly recommend this fine hotel.",5,2016,10,04
211,A delightful 3 days in Dublin,"From the minute we were greeted at the front entrance we were made to feel like we were special guests.  Our room was immaculately clean and very comfortable.   The full breakfasts were so much more than we expected and the service was excellent.  We especially enjoyed our dinners each night because of the wonderful food and the very friendly servers.   A very big thank you to Sean who greeted us upon our arrival, and to Hollie, Raj, and Marko for making our dinner meals so memorable!",5,2016,10,04
211,"nice hotel, great location!","We stayed 4 nights in between games as it is across from a stadium!! I a quiet residential neighborhood but within walking distance to many pubs & restaurants. Quiet hotel & room, friendly staff. Clean & comfortable. Excellent food in the bar!",5,2016,10,03
211,Still a class act,"Stayed here one night midweek. Hadn't been in a while, still as good as ever.
Hassle free parking, good location, brisk walk to city centre, if weather is poor get a taxi easily from the hotel.
Didn't eat lunch or dinner here but had breakfast, excellent and varied...
Service from all I encountered from reception to bar to lobby to breakfast area was excellent....
If you can stay on 4th floor, great rooms. This a very clean and very busy hotel, lots of Americans, I put it down to the comfy beds..only kidding but they are great beds and pillows...",5,2016,10,03
211,Pre and post match drink ,"Went there twice in 3 weeks.The toilets were dirty ,the service at the bar was slow and I was only getting a Coke.The staff ,especially the door staff are quite rude,definitely could use customer service training.",1,2016,10,02
211,Great place to stay,Always a pleasure to check in here. Location is convenient to access and staff are efficient and welcoming in every stay. The bar food is top class and the atmosphere generally in this hotel is friendly and fun.,5,2016,09,29
211,Very pleasant overall experience,"We only stayed one night in Dublin, and the Croke Park served us very well. The room was spacious, quiet and comfortable, the bed was comfortable and linens were good quality. There is a garage but you pay for parking. 

We walked into Dublin despite a few warnings  about the immediate neighborhood, but while it was clearly not upscale, we had no problems (I might feel differently about walking the area at night.) It was a bit of a walk  -maybe 15-20 minutes - into the city proper, but we enjoy walking city neighborhoods. The hotel is located directly across the street from a stadium, but there was no activity there the night we stayed, so I can't comment on any noise or other disturbance factors, but the hotel seems well maintained and seems like it would be a calm oasis.

We had dinner in the restaurant at the hotel and it was delightful. I had a lamb dish that was sweet and tender. The only problem in the restaurant was an annoying humming noise in one area. We had to change tables because of it.

Would definitely recommend the hotel.",4,2016,09,28
211,YOU MUST STAY HERE,"This is my third review on this hotel. I stayed here for one night with my partner on 25th September. This is why you should stay at this hotel. 1) Great location with easy access to city centre. 2) Lovely modern hotel with spacious bedrooms. 3) Great food served in restaurant or bar. 4) The quality and choice on the breakfast menu. 5) This is the most important point, FANTASTIC staff in all sections but especially front of house. We will definitely be back.",5,2016,09,28
211,Quiet Elegant Dublin Hotel,"A great exec hotel, a perfect base for exploring Dunlin. 5* atay without the 5* price tag.
A beautiful hotel in a beautiful city.
The staff here are wonderful. The girl on the desk helped guide me & my fiancé to everywhere we wanted to visit. She knew all the hotshots for nights out etc.
The restraunt has a great selection of food also.
When we checked in as it was a special occassion we got a wonderful welcome card and a bottle of sparkling wine. We were also given a couple of drinks vouchers to see in the bar downstairs. 
Beware match days can be quite rowdy but why would you have it any other way.
If you want a exec stay with modern coms, quiet but yet all you need this is the perfect place.
We had the exec lounge included in our room which meant free soft drinks and snacks in the lounge any time we wanted.  We could also chose to have breaky in the lounge if we didn't want to go down to main restraunt. The breakfast cooked and continental is some of the best I've had in a long while.
Can't recommend this place highly enough. 
My 2nd stay here and wouldn't stay anywhere else. ",5,2016,09,24
211,Excellent Hotel Ideally Situated,"Stayed here for 4 nights on the 12 of Sept,

very clean hotel the staff on the front desk where really attentive and offered us hot towels to wash our faces upon arrival and check in which was very much needed.

Rooms where clean and spacious with all the usuall coffee and tea making facilities you'd expect.

We where on the 4th floor which gives u access to the executive lounge which was stocked up with biscuits,water and tea/coffee in the morning you can go in there and help yourself to croissants and things like that.

We opted to pay extra for the full Irish breakfast which was a help yourself buffet, lots of choice with the usuall items eggs anyway you want them and even pancakes.

We also had a complimentary bar voucher each night which we used whilst dining in the restaurant which was very nice all the food was very reasonable and of good quality, staff very attentive and nothing was too much trouble.

Getting there was easy using Google maps just get the 41 or the 16 from the airport then stop off at porters pub and it's a short walk from there, the visitors leap card is a good idea it's all your travel for a pre defined period (say 3 or 5 days) so can use on most bus services . 

We went for the freedom pass which included the hop on hop off bus but that is only for 1 to 3 days but can use most bus services on it so is great value, also the hotel offer a free shuttle into town (times by check-in desk) but if you want a nice walk it's only 15 minutes into the center from the hotel also the train\team station is close by too.

Cannot recommend this hotel highly enough will be definitely stay here again.",5,2016,09,24
211,Fantastic Hotel,Stayed here for 2 nights and was very pleased with the hotel! Lovely friendly staff and the food in the bar was fantastic! Would definitely recommend to anyone and will be visiting again.  We walked into the city centre but got a taxi back which was about 8 euros and taxi to airport was 18 euros. Would recommend the hotel oil the wheels on the cleaning staff trolleys as they come round at 7am and it does wake you up other than that we had a fab stay.,5,2016,09,24
211,Very comfortable clean hotel,"We have stayed here on a few occasions and the standards never slip. 
Very friendly and welcoming staff and the ambience of the hotel is spot on.
The breakfast buffet has such a great variety and the food is good.
We also popped into the executive lounge and it was very welcoming and homely and had again a good variety of food snacks and beverages.
We visited the day of the All Ireland and the place was hopping but it was no bother for the cool staff.
A mention needs to go to staff who had the place spick & span  and fresh the next morning.
Well done we will return

",5,2016,09,23
211,Another excellent All-Ireland stay @ Croke Park Hotel,"Another excellent All-Ireland stay @ Croke Park Hotel, thanks to Sean & all his staff. Superb location, highly attentive staff in a very busy period obviously and great food/drinks/service overall. There is ZERO better option out there if you're visiting Croke Park and/or North Dublin in general :) ",4,2016,09,23
211,Fantastic stay!,Surpassed our expectations! Nice location and a pleasant walk to the Center of town. The food was excellent in the restaurant and the breakfast was outstanding - the staff was extremely friendly and the hotel was very clean and up to date. ,5,2016,09,21
211,"Nice, modern hotel with all the amenities","We checked into this hotel and the end of our two week tour of Ireland and were pleasantly surprised.  This was by far the most modern and best kept hotel we visited.  The staff was ready for us when our busload of 34 people arrived and the check in was the fastest we experienced.  Off the bus and into our room in 30 minutes with our luggage.  The rooms were large with a separate tub and shower in the bath.  Within a 20-30 minute walk to downtown shopping was a plus too.  Breakfast was excellent with a wide assortment of pastry, cereal, and eggs.  Staff super attentive and helpful.  Only thing to be wary of is the fact that this hotel sits across the street from a football stadium so you might not want to stay here on game day.  We found it to be quiet when we were there.",4,2016,09,19
211,"Super Staff, Hotel is Pricey.","Was met by Sofia, could not have been more friendly and courteous and helpful.   Bistro Food was excellent.  Drinks were pricey, But we did have coupons for free drinks... Forgot to use.  Room was comfy.  Would stay again.  ",4,2016,09,19
211,Superb,From the moment we entered we were treated like VIP's (and we're not!). The rooms were lovely and the food was out of this world. We also were really looked after by the concierge Krisna. Thanks. We had a great stay.,5,2016,09,19
211,Croke Park Dublin - Pleasant surprise,"We stayed at the Croke Park for 2 days before returning to the states September 11-12. The accommodations were modern, clean and very pleasant. The staff was wonderful and helpful. We stayed during some playoff games at the stadium but there was no excessive crowd. We did find that after the last game on Sunday night, the crowd gathered for about an hour in the bar and were a little boisterous but it was all in good fun and they dispersed in an hour. We ate in the hotel restaurant twice and found it very good and reasonably priced for Dublin. We are still raving about the creamy vegetable soup. We highly recommend.",5,2016,09,18
211,Nice and quiet on a non-game day,"Our family had a positive experience at the Croke Park Hotel.  We had a quick check-in experience and provided a nice quiet end of hall room.  The room was clean, spacious and accommodating.  The staff was nice and we left two days prior to a game at the stadium across from the hotel.  

We definitely could see the benefits of staying in this hotel for a full day pre-game partying and preparation.  

We selected the hotel based on its positive rating and mid-range pricing.  The only complaint we had with the hotel was the outrageous parking fee that came with the room.  It was known going into our stay, but had we no known that factor we would have been unsettled by steepness of such a fee.  They truly love their parking deck at the Croke Park.",4,2016,09,18
211,Outstanding hotel with exceptionally welcoming staff,"the room, relatively newly refurbished, was 1st class, the staff so helpfull and welcoming so would highly recommend. 
The whole experience would be one that adds to the experience of Dublin and in now way detracts from it.",5,2016,09,18
211,Very comfortable ,"Soft and cozy bed. Cozy rooms. Clean bathroom with shower plus tub. Elegant looking. Very nice stuff plus they give you warm towels on check-in and bottles on water on check out. 
Negative: doesn't include breakfast, not near the city center.",4,2016,09,17
211,Great Location and value for money,"Having stayed on more than one occasion, one would recommend The Croke Park Hotel for any length of stay in Dublin. 
The service, interior and the staff were always excellent. It is highly likely it will meet your expectations' and more for which the tastes of this beautiful city will remain in your memory.",5,2016,09,17
211,Nice Hotel,"Check-in was very good, offered hot towels.
Room very large, ensuite good size great shower.
Breakfast was good and just OK.
Arriving for a table, the staff were indifferent.
The selection was good, but when I asked one of the cooks for poached eggs the answer was no.
The table next to us had poached eggs!!!!
It took 3 goes to get an espresso.",4,2016,09,17
211,Was fab!,"We were there for a very short time only but was impressed! 
We arrived approx 10pm and the night manager was really informative and helpful without going over board ( as we'd just come off a long haul flight and had children with us)
We were offered a warm towel, and the reception area smelt lovely with all the candles. They were quick to check us in, and offer a wake up call and newspaper for the morning.They were also very helpful in booking us an extra large taxi for our early departure for the airport the following morning.

The room was massive with 2 doubles and a single bed. The provided White Company toiletries were lovely, and there was tea and coffee provided in the room.

We left super early and were offered some light refreshments for the journey, also there was an offer to help with luggage. The staff all looked refreshed and keen to help which is a change for 5am at most hotels! 

Keen to stay in Ireland again for a trip and would definitely book here again. Seemed like really good value to me!",5,2016,09,17
211,Spoiled and loved every minute!,"We reserved this hotel based on the proximity to Dublin city center, the great reviews, and the price.  We felt like we were staying at a posh NYC hotel for a bargain price.  The hotel is very clean and polished.  So clean, I felt comfortable taking a bubble bath in their sparkling white tub.  The service was wonderful.  The restaurant offered fresh breakfast each morning and the rest of their menu was just as tasty.  Yes, you have to walk about 15 minutes to the popular areas of Dublin but we still considered it a convenient accommodation.",5,2016,09,16
211,Above expectations,"I've stayed twice a year at this hotel for the last 4 years  - this time there was a noticable upgrade in everything making it an excellent hotel to stay in. 
Good quality food & choice, great customer service and a pleasant comfortable stay to work in around meetings.
The only slight let down was they don't list the gym on the website as an amenity however there is a very good one so I missed out on that. 
See you next year!",5,2016,09,16
211,Great location for Croke Park,We wanted to few near the airport and the men wanted to visit Croke Park ( we're from Australia). The hotel was great and so were most of the staff but the receptionist was very clear ( English wasn't her first language) and the person seating us for breakfast was very brisk! Hard to get tea & toast orders too! Overhaul a very good stay. ,4,2016,09,15
211,Great hotel in a great location,"Recently stayed at the Croke Park Hotel on a business and leisure stay. Superb location, great clean spacious rooms with open wifi ( be requirement to log in with any details etc.) Would highly recommend to stay here",5,2016,09,15
211,Great Stay ,"Very helpful staff in their suggestions in what to do to in town, very accommodating, food was good, and the was neat and clean. Shuttle back from downtown could be more frequent. Can walk to O'Connell Street but it is a 10 to 15 minutes, but good exercise. ",5,2016,09,15
211,Exceptional response from the Chef .,"Yesterday I was driving a friend from Heuston Station to Dublin airport.My friend had been in hospital outside Dublin , where the food did not agree with him.He was hungry and asked if by chance there would be a possibility of having some pasta to eat on route to the airport.We stopped in the Croke Park hotel in the off chance some pasta might be available.It being mid afternoon I thought it was unlikely.
Whilst reading a well printed & extensive menu outside the bar/restaurant area the chef passed by .I took the opportunity of asking as to whether it might be possible to have some pasta to,eat, advising that I was aware it was not on the menu.The chef immediately stated that she would be happy to prepare and serve pasta to us, and 15 minute later 2 dishes or superb pasta was on our table. Absolutely excellent service.",5,2016,09,14
211,Lots of luxury and facilities,"Our room was clean and spacious. Our bathroom had separate bath and shower. The staff were always pleasant and gave us free bottled water on departure. The free parking was excellent. The wifi was fast and reliable. There are also PCs with printers on ground floor. Continental breakfast for less than 10 Euros was good, but don't bother with the Irish breakfast as it was overcooked and tasteless. If you want a really good coffee, order an espresso with a separate jug of frothed milk and mix to your taste. We also had dinner here which was ok, but note there is nothing else nearby.",5,2016,09,14
211,"Good hotel , fab staff","Good hotel with a good size underground free car park. Staff in the hotel are excellent and great with kids.  I've stayed here many times and can't think of anything that's not good. Dublin zoo is only a 15 minute drive away and town centre is about a ten minute walk. Recommend staying here, it's the only hotel we stay in when in Dublin.
",5,2016,09,13
211,Excellent service,"nice clean rooms with bath and showers near a big park.
there is a nice small Gym in the hotel with free fruits and water.
Breakfast is very nice and you can order Omelettes and pancake and Espresso.
 
Across from the Crock Stadium and that means if you are a fan of Irish football you will have great happenings and first row to the Games on weekends,  
On weekends the hotel is a part of the local football festival and open his doors to the fans with Bars and happenings.
the location is a bit far from center of town but you can rent a Dublin Bike from near by and enjoy riding in Dublin.",4,2016,09,13
211,"Lovely hotel, great breakfast!","The hotel was very clean, rooms were very nice, staff was extremely helpful and friendly.  Breakfast was great, including eggs ""over easy"", which you rarely find on a breakfast buffet!  The only drawback for us was the location.  It would be great if you are in Dublin for a game at the stadium (across the street), but we wanted to see the sights of central Dublin, which was quite a hike!  We didn't mind, because we like to walk! But others would need a taxi to city center.  All in all, a very pleasant experience!",4,2016,09,12
211,As good as I expected!,"Having researched Dublin hotels thoroughly before booking, the Croke Park more than met my expectations. The staff were friendly and welcoming on arrival and were attentive throughout my stay. My room was large and very comfortable and the hotel was quiet at night, despite it being the weekend of the hurling final. Yes, the hotel is a short distance from the city centre but I had no difficulty getting back and forth from Drumcondra station (which is a 5 to 10 minute walk) and the train took me direct to Pearse station, which is in the heart of the city. The TripAdvisor reviews led me to believe the Croke Park to be an excellent hotel and I wasn't disappointed!",5,2016,09,11
211,Fantastic place to stay,"Great hotel, location, spotless rooms that were well appointed and very helpful &  friendly reception staff , nothing was too much trouble. Food in both restaurants was excellent and brekky great value. Would highly recommend this place to stay in Dublin.",5,2016,09,11
211,first impression of Dublin,"Hotel was okay....rooms comfortable, nothing around the hotel.  We were told by bus driver to get a taxi at night because the area is a little dicey.  We were glad there was not a stadium event...that would have been horrible.",3,2016,09,10
211,Nice Accomodation,"The hotel and staff were really good. Staff were warm, friendly and attentive and the Executive lounge was a really nice touch.  The concierge was spot on with his information and made the day trip into Dublin very easy. Parking was excellent. 

Food and service in the Bistro were below par in comparison to the Hotel service.

Definitely going back when in Dublin again.",4,2016,09,10
211,Away from City Center,"Being older, the ""short walk"" to a bus stop or attractions was too hard on me.  The hotel itself is fine but in a rather seedy area and remote.  If you have sore feet and don't want to want by all means stay here and get taxis.  The buffet breakfast is very good.",3,2016,09,09
211,If there is a match on in Croke Park skip this hotel.,"The Croke Park Hotel is a great hotel but I made the mistake of booking it while there was a match at Croke Park Stadium, ist fantastic business for the hotel and I fully understand that but the next time I'm planning to stay and if there is a match on I will stay somewhere else.
The hotel was fully packed, if you were lucky enough to get a drink by the time you got away from the bar half of the drink would have been spilled and God help you if you took more than one drink at a time, ha,ha.",4,2016,09,09
211,Always Made Feel Welcome,"I have stayed in the Croke Park Hotel on numerous occasions this year and each visit is welcomed with a smile and a ""Can-Do"" attitude. The room is always spotless and the staff are very attentive. It s a destination if using for business wimake you feel its for pleasure too.ll ",5,2016,09,09
211,Easy access to City Center,"Right across from the Croke Park stadium.  Easy 20 minute walk to Trinity College (Book of Kells), Temple bar area.  Cabs are also cheap in Dublin.  $10 euros each way.
This hotel fit the bill for comfortable beds, good hotel food and bar.",4,2016,09,07
211,Recent stay at the Croke Park Hotel,"My wife and my mom visited Ireland for the first time September 1 - 6.  We were looking for a nice, clean hotel situated in Dublin that could also accommodate some special needs my mom had (mobility, hand bar assistance in the restroom, etc.)  We couldn't have been more pleased with the hotel.  The staff and service was excellent.  Pricing was very reasonable.  The accommodations made available to us at the hotel made our experience one that exceeded expectations.  We were all very pleased.  The next time we visit Dublin we are planning to stay at the Croke Park Hotel again.  Thank you!!",5,2016,09,07
211,Great hotel with excellent and friendly service,"Stayed 3 nights in The Croke Park as part of a get-away to Dublin with my wife. Very nice and modern hotel with great big rooms and comfortable beds. Very friendly and service minded staff, and breakfast buffet was good, but not overly exciting - We did not eat in the restaurant. Hotel is not located in the best neighboorhoud and is a 15-20 min walk (5 min walk to bus stop) from the city center, but if that is not an issue for you this is a good deal and we will definitely consider staying here again.",4,2016,09,06
211,Great Hotel,"A great hotel, always stay in the Croke Park when I go to Dublin.  The rooms are very spacious and the breakfast is superb.  Staff are extremely helpful and friendly.  Plenty of car parking spaces available. ",5,2016,09,06
211,GAA Crazy Stay,"Showed up on Sunday morning to avoid driving in traffic and the GAA crowds later in the afternoon. One of two rooms were ready and we could check in.  Concierge was exceptionally helpful getting hop on hop off passes and contacting Kilmahnam Gaol and helping us figure out how to get tickets to the Mayo/Tipp Gaelic Semi Final.
When we returned the place was a zoo with fans.....it was awesome....no uptight people keeping the fans contained. As long as they did not leave the hotel, they could enjoy their drink and chat in peace.....after the game there was music and people everywhere and such a joyful atmosphere...both sets of fans filled every nook and cranny of the hotel bars/lounges/restaurants/outdoor patio.....
Breakfast was great and everything worked out great.  We planned to train to Belfast and asked if we could possibly leave our rental car in the hotel parking garage till we returned...the answer?  That shouldn't be a problem.  Are you kidding me! we ended up driving but what customer service!
We got lucky ending up in a hotel across the street from the stadium but it was not just that that made the stay special.  
Could have used a better price for 2 rooms since we had 3 grown kids ( 14, 18 and 20) but we can't be chosers.....",4,2016,09,05
211,Wedding,Excellent facilities - nice Hotel.  Staff very pleasant and helpful.  The food was excellent.  The function room was lovely and breakfast was very nice. Had a great nights sleep - the bed was very comfortable.  Good location. Was very impressed.,5,2016,09,05
211,Great stay at Croke Park,"Just spent a week at the Croke Park and had a great experience.  The hotel is in a good location and has all the amenities you need for a city stay.  Rooms are spacious, clean and amenities are good.  The staff are friendly and efficient. ",5,2016,09,04
211,Amazing Hotel/ Friendly Staff,"We stayed here on our honeymoon recently and everything was great.  Marta at the front desk was so helpful switching our room because we needed non-smoking.  I would definitely stay here again.  This is a 5 star hotel, service was excellent and the staff were so friendly and helpful.",5,2016,09,02
211,"Great Hotel, a little off the beaten path but if Croke park is on your agenda definitley choose The Croke Park Hotel!","So clean , good food great service.  Rooms and bathrooms were impeccable.  Bar staff friendly and helpful.  Easy to get on the hop on hop off bus.  GAA museum across the street is a great way to start a visit to Dublin.  We loved it so much we already booked a trip this winter!",5,2016,09,01
211,First class hotel,Loved the hotel very good staff could not be more helpful.easy walk for a pensioner into city centre plus great underground car park with easy lift to reception of hotel.very good breakfast..will be staying again an I recommend .,5,2016,08,31
211,Clean and new hotel,Very efficient operation with pleasant and attentive staff. We had a family room which easily catered for our two young kids without things feeling cramped. The hotel had a connecting bus link with the open top bus tours which helped us easily access Dublin. Breakfast was extensive and tasty and dinner selection hit the mark. Impressed.,5,2016,08,30
211,Outstanding service!!!,"Outstanding hotel!!!
Amazingly convenient for Croke Park and less than 10 minutes away from Dublin airport. 
Exceptionally competent and hospitable staff.
I was hugely impressed by the efficiency and smoothness of operation given that the hotel was catering to a large number of guests attending one of the biggest events of the season. 
The hotel is new and well maintained; tastefully decorated in subtle and refined 
palettes. 
Room service was prompt and of a high standard despite the crowds in reception and all public areas. The restaurant food was also excellent, particularly the roast lamb!
I hesitate to name staff as every individual I encountered was unbelievably welcoming and helpful without being intrusive. Siobhán at reception and Krishna, the concierge went to great lengths (as did the the reception manager) to ensure our experience was memorable. The outstanding service at this hotel is on par with the very best luxury hotels across the world. 
This was my first stay. I certainly plan to return and highly recommend it to anyone visiting Dublin (I also discovered the hotel is only a 12 minute walk to O'Connell St. which means it is perfectly located for almost any type of city visit).",5,2016,08,30
211,A very nice hotel in a great location,"It is very difficult to find fault with this hotel. it has it all. High quality well furnished rooms,secure free parking, excellent bar & restaurant, well trained efficient staff. However, it all becomes madness if their is a big game at Croke Park. If it wasn't for the big game and hence the modified hours of the restaurant, we would have scored itexcellent.",4,2016,08,30
211,Great stay in Dublin!,"Myself and my boyfriend stayed at The Croke Park Hotel for 4 Nights. The room was very spacious and very clean, staff were very attentive and helpful. Breakfast was fine, with a variety of Cereal, Hot Food and Fruit. 

In terms of location, the hotel is very close to Dublin Airport, we travelled via Bus and it took approximately 30 mins. It is a 20 minute walk to the main Dublin area. 

Overall, a great experience and would definitely recommend.",5,2016,08,29
211,Dream stay ,"Could not fault this hotel. 
Early check- in facilitated as well as two complimentary drinks of our choice. Ideal location. But the biggest asset to This hotel is its Staff - cleaning staff were were polite as were porters, reception, waiting and manager. 

Additionally, our room was so luxurious and spacious and overlooking the Croke Park Stadium which was a real treat. The lunch was very tasty albeit a little expensive for the portion given. Had the most generous breakfast in the relaxing atmosphere of the executive suite. Would definitely recommend this hotel without hesitation. ",5,2016,08,29
211,"Great hotel, location and price!",Booked in for 1 night on our staycation in Ireland. It was very reasonably priced for a Friday night in Dublin. Parking included which is great. Got fab food in the bar. Room was clean and comfortable. Staff were very eager to help and lovely and friendly. ,5,2016,08,29
211,Great visit,Called this morning with my husband for breakfast and could not be happier with the food and service. I understand it is difficult to remain calm on busy breakfast mornings however the staff were very efficient and managed the busy workload excellently. Our server Ciaran was very pleasant and looked after us well! :) The scrambled eggs were too watery for my liking however everything else was delicious! Would happily come again.,4,2016,08,28
211,excellent again,"Stayed here as a family of 5, 4 adults and an 8 year old, we have stayed here before on numerous occasions and this time was possible the best yet which is pretty good going as it has always been well above average every time we have stayed. The rooms were a very good size ( 1 family 1 double )  the executive lounge was well stocked with soft drinks, fruit and biscuits and a buffet breakfast in the mornings, most of the time it was very clean and tidy, unfortunately we used the lounge after other guests had been in there and whomever they were they obviously had no respect for their surroundings or other guests but that's not the hotels fault. Reception and concierge staff were extremely helpful and informative. We ate in the hotel both nights and the food was very good but the thing that made our stay even more enjoyable was RAJ our waiter on both nights, what an exceptional member of staff he was attentive, friendly efficient and good fun, a very very nice man, thank you Raj. Will absolutely use Croke Park again",5,2016,08,28
211,Fab hotel!,"Well positioned for Croke Park, this hotel is gorgeous! It is clean, comfortable and the rooms and bathrooms are spacious, the bed very comfortable. Lots of nice touches such as lemon flannel to refresh on arrival (which I haven't seen for years!), a honeycomb at the breakfast bar and a complimentary bottle of water on departure.  A lovely hotel with friendly staff.",5,2016,08,28
211,Stay again .Yes!!!,"No complaints at all.Excellent service and facilities .Spotlessly clean throughout.Food choice good and quality of meals could not be bettered .Helpful,efficient and knowledgeable staff. Always a smile and a greeting .Nothing too much trouble.
.Easy access from airport.Walkable to City Centre.",5,2016,08,28
211,Modern and clean hotel,"This hotel is located on the outskirts of town, about a 15 minute walk to city center.  Hotel is very clean and rooms are well appointed. Nice big bathroom with separate tub and shower. Bar downstairs is lively and the food was good too.  Loved the seafood chowder.  Free parking was appreciated.  We would definitely stay here again.",5,2016,08,27
211,Great hotel but a few grumbles,"Booked for a 1 night stay before returning to Holyhead on the ferry.
With this in mind this hotel is ideally located just 10 minutes away.
The check in staff were very friendly and helpful and made us feel welcome.
The bar staff equally as friendly. We ate in the bar from that menu and the food was excellent. The downside was the music was so loud we could hardly speak to each other and when mixed with screaming kids it became unbearable at times. Music is supposed to create atmosphere not stifle conversation.
Talking of music, it continued all night and our room was directly above tha bar so we heard it most of the night. We had a room overlooking the canal and the whino's were up early making a noise.
We had to skip breakfast as we were running late so can't comment on that.
The cost for the single night was high but I guess its location and the style meant that prices could be raised. Car parking was free. Overall, an expensive night ruined by the noise.",4,2016,08,27
211,The Croke Park-A very nice place to stay in Dublin,"The Croke Park Hotel is located roughly 1 Km from the city center of Dublin.  Our room was very nice, the breakfast buffets were great (you can order omelets, pancakes, french toast, etc from the kitchen), and the staff was extremely helpful and friendly. We also received a pleasant surprise when we checked in: champagne to celebrate our 37th anniversary. For those who choose to use the Dublin Bus Tour Hop On Hop Off system, there is a shuttle that will pick you up at the Croke Park and take you to their 1st stop.
If you are planning on visiting Dublin, the Croke Park is a great choice to stay at.",5,2016,08,27
211,Mixed experience,"On arrival the greeting from staff was as you would expect, i.e. warm and friendly. The  room was clean. Location: just a short distance away from the town centre with good public transport to get there. Lots of local amenities. We had lunch and dinner on our first day there which was enjoyable. Staff were polite and engaging.

However on our 2nd day a member of staff at breakfast through her non-verbal but very emotive negative facial expressions made it clear she felt we ought not to be there. When  approached for an explanation with somewhat indignation she stated we needed to pay for our breakfast. It was then we were able to clarify that we had paid, had been given seating and informed we could then help ourselves at the breakfast buffet, as was the procedure the day before.She said oh! offering no apology went on to explain at some point a member of staff would come over to see if we would would like tea, coffee or toast with our breakfast.

The same said member of staff came over and offered tea, coffee and toast when she came to clear our table! We graciously accepted the hot drinks.  

The night  before we had ordered room service and did not get all that we ordered. They explained they were very busy and apologised for the error - which we accepted as it's easily done.

The following evening we again ordered room service and what we ordered arrived cold instead of hot. In addition,when room service staff arrived not taking our word that we had left details to be billed on checking out (as was the night before) - rang reception (from our room) to check that we had left instructions to be billed on leaving. Reception confirmed we had.

On this occasion we informed the manager of what we felt was unacceptable room service that evening. And also everything that had previously transpired that morning at breakfast. He apologised on behalf of the hotel stating it was not the way they did things. He informed us he would speak with staff (although we were able to identify the staff member)  and offered to take off that nights poor room service from our bill. We felt the manager to be genuine and empathetic.

It was the next morning on arrival for breakfast we noticed the change in the majority of the staff's demeanor. No good morning (as was previous). Very distant. No asking, as was previously, how is everything? We were made to feel very uncomfortable. 
Therefore, we did not dine in the bistro restaurant that evening as we had done the previous evening, no longer ordered room service in the evening and cancelled breakfast for the following morning. It was a difficult choice as we had a child in the group for whom sudden change can be very unsettling.

It's a shame as it started off so promisingly. We can only guess the manager had indeed informed staff of our experiences and they in turn displayed their displeasure at us.
At the time we had not raised an official complaint only informed the manager of our experiences. He made the decision to speak to staff.
We now wish we had just 'sucked' it all up and not said anything. 

On our departure at reception other guests checking out were asked: How was your stay? We were notably, not asked.

We will go back to Dublin again (although sadly not stay at this Hotel) as it was fantastic and having being forced to seek alternative eateries made it even more interesting to compare/contrast the various excellent alternative choices close by.

If it were not for the above experiences we would have rated it much higher.

In summary: If you have anything negative to say about the staff wait until you have checked out. Otherwise, if not in agreement, staff through their passive-aggressive behaviour will let you know what they think of that.",3,2016,08,26
211,One night stay before a flight ,"We arrived at the hotel around 6:30 the night before our flight home from Dublin. After checking in, we went to look for dinner and decided on The Sideline Bar at the hotel. The service was amazing and the food was beyond our expectations for a hotel bar. You must try the white chocolate baileys cheesecake! It is heavenly. 
Our room was comfortable and somewhat large by European standards. The concierge was helpful. My only disappointment was the breakfast selection. It is very basic and it would have been nice to have eggs or something more substantial. Overall, a nice hotel that met our needs for a one night stay. ",4,2016,08,26
211,"Quiet, clean, lovely staff","i really liked this hotel, stayed two nights before our tour of Ireland. The room was spotless, quiet, good bed, shower and bath. Good breakfast, you can order as well. Lovely bar area. We ate dinner there one night and it was pretty good. Bit of a walk into town, but it didn't affect my rating of the hotel. I would stay again.",5,2016,08,26
211,Awesome hotel!,"What a great hotel. We were upgraded to the 4th or 5th floor (cant recall) with complimentary exec lounge access. Clean rooms, a/c for the first time on our two week trip through Ireland made for a very enjoyable stay. Location is a bit outside city centre but the short walk into town was enjoyable. Staff provided some sightseeing tips and the nice staff person in the exec lounge from Argentina was so friendly. Best hotel on our trip by far. Taxi to airport very convenient - little or no wait time at all. ",5,2016,08,25
211,Brilliant ,All and all excellent service food and staff and rooms are beautiful ! Lobby is brilliant to lounge and chef and receptionist both very friendly ! I'd definitely recommend this hotel to anyone staying in dublins city center it's ideal and right beside all types of public transport ! ,5,2016,08,24
211,Excellent ,"Once again I had an excellent stay here
Service was excellent even though hotel was busy and was fully booked.i would highly  recommend the Croke Park hotel 
Excellent food,great people and service for all of my stay
Well done to all management and staff

",5,2016,08,24
211,Fabulous!,Stayed for one night to celebrate our silver wedding and husband's birthday. Staff were excellent and even sent a card and extra prosecco to our room as a gift. Sadly as we had already ordered prosecco from them and spent the evening in Dublin drinking Guinness (!) we weren't able to drink their gift but the thought was most appreciated. Thank you! Breakfast was extremely good - especially the honeycomb. The only slight downside is the distance to the city. It is 10-15 minutes walk to O'Connell St but another 15 on top of that to get to temple bar etc. We didn't mind this but it is worth considering if you don't like walking. The green tour bus does stop outside too though and this is an excellent experience. Overall I'd thoroughly recommend this hotel.,5,2016,08,24
211,Great hotel,"Great location friendly staff, great food and very clean rooms, five minute walk to the town centre also recommend that you try and go and watch a GAA game. Under ground parking at no cost, taxi cost €10 to get from hotel to the Aviva Stadium very cheap.",5,2016,08,24
211,"Fantastic hotel, location and staff","Just spent a few nights here. 
Hotel is a perfect location about €15 in taxi to airport and €8 to town. 
The rooms are spacious and meticulously clean. 
Every member of staff was a huge credit to the hotel- so friendly and efficient- treated like royalty. From the quick helpful service at the reception, hints and tips from the concierge, bar and restaurant staff, where nothing was too much and the precision of cleaning from the maids.  
All in all one of the best hotels I have stayed in for a long time! ",5,2016,08,24
211,Brilliant Trip,"I stayed at this hotel with my son who had travelled home from Australia, we had a brilliant experience from start to finish, The staff were friendly and very welcoming, the room was spotlessly clean, and room office was excellent.",5,2016,08,24
211,Excellent for a weekend away (if you don't mind walking),"Superb hotel, location is about 20 - 30 mins out of the city centre of Dublin, and to get a taxi it was about $10 at night.

Excellent service and the greeting on arrival is just what you need when you get off the plane.

The bar is VERY VERY expensive with a large glass of wine charged at $16, although the variety at breakfast was good.",4,2016,08,23
211,Excepitional service great facilities,I arrived to the Croke park hotel the day the all Ireland football finals were on. It was very busy . I was not feeling very well so the lady that checked me in said she would get a room for us as soon as possible. We had booked a deluxe room so we had use of the executive lounge. This was very helpful as the hotel was busy and the lounge was quiet our room was ready earlier than expected and it was a good size rom with everything my husband and I needed. During the night I got more unwell and my husband rang reception . They organised a taxi to bring me to the Mater hospital . The man on reception was so helpful and really concerned for my wellbeing . I am fully recovered but I must thanks the staff for being so kind and helpful to me and my husband . Go rainy Maithili agat,5,2016,08,23
211,Overnight,"Love staying here, so handy with free parking. Worth booking deluxe room as continental  breakfast  included, use of lounge and free drink in bar. Good buzz  around hotel as well. It's only approximately a ten minute walk to o Connell street but taxis aren't that far away. Nice little Italian place near by as well that does specials.",4,2016,08,23
211,Lovely staff ,"Stayed here 2 days ago with two friends as we had an exam the next day in the croke park stadium- free parking which is always a bonus!! Receptionists were all very friendly and welcoming, lovely little touches like hot towels and bottles
of water. Reception area nice. Corridors and scenery lovely. Was a little bit disappointed with the size of the room as it was a little small, although it was spotlessly clean and the furniture was beautiful, the bathroom was amazing! Not often you have a shower and bath which was a nice surprise! Atmosphere during the night was a little loud which I know sometimes can't be helped working in the industry myself, overall a pleasant and enjoyable stay and would go back again for a night away. ",4,2016,08,23
211,Dublin stay,"Had a great stay at Croke Park Hotel August 4 -6, 2016.  Hotel is modern with great amenities including free parking, free computer use, a great bar and restaurant.  Easy taxi ride to/from the center of Dublin.  I would recommend this hotel.",5,2016,08,22
211,Fabulous Hotel!,"Stayed at this hotel for the entirety of our 4 day stay in Dublin.  It was fantastic in all aspects, with the exception of one.  It is about 15 min walk out of town center.  It did not bother us at all but this may be a drawback for some.  Our package had our room on the 4th floor with access to the executive lounge, a drink coupon per person per day, free breakfast at the restaurant daily, and one dinner during our stay.  Executive lounge had continental breakfast, bottled juice and water, and biscuits during the day.  The package was well worth the extra $50 I paid.  The room was clean and spacious, as was the bathroom.  It had a soaking tub, which I used nightly.  The hotel had turn down service with a chocolate on the pillow.  Breakfast was terrific and plentiful.  It had something to please everyone.  Try the honeycomb; it was divine.  Based on the amenities I received for the price I got, the inconvenience of the walk to town was negligible.  I would stay here again in a heartbeat.  I look forward to my next trip to Dublin and my next stay at the Croke Park Hotel.",5,2016,08,21
211,Stunning Hotel,"We stayed here for one night in July. This was our second time staying here and it was just as good as the first. Check in was very prompt. The staff are all very friendly and helpful. Rooms are nice and comfortable. The view from our room off Croke Park Stadium was an added bonus. The food in the main restaurant was lovely and staff very efficient, as it was quite busy while we were there. Overall our stay was perfect and we will be return again to this hotel.",5,2016,08,21
211,Excellent Location,"We stayed here for 1 night B&B with evening meal, staff very friendly and helpful. Hotel very clean rooms fab, i would recommend B&B only as selection for dinner was poor and pub grub looked better but food was ok just poor selection. Did not spoil our stay",5,2016,08,21
211,Quality hotel just a bit outside the city center,"The front desk efficiently checked us in, and we were given a room that did not face the front road, so it was quiet and peaceful. The room was spacious with a large bathroom, comfortable bed, and electrical adapters for us to borrow. Breakfast was included with our rate because we had booked for 4 nights, and it was a great buffet selection each morning, including the morning that we had an early flight out, when they packed bags of fruit and muffins for us. The hotel was a short 25 minute walk to the attractions at the city center, but it was better to take a 10 euro cab ride when we were coming back late at night.",5,2016,08,21
211,Great hotel in every sense,"Our stay at the Croke Park Hotel was excellent.  We were made to feel very welcome and staff throughout the stay were very friendly and very helpful, something that means a lot to the customer.  Room service is of a high quality and the hotel is very child friendly - our 2 year old was not ignored but spoken to every day.  Food at the Bistro was fabulous.  The hotel was very clean and décor is smart. Can't fault this hotel at all.",5,2016,08,20
211,Excellent,Had a family room (superior twin). Two big double beds. Spacious & cosy. Staff were very helpful and friendly. Large breakfast buffet with lots to choose from. Something for everyone. On site parking and only a 15 min walk to the city centre. Will definatly be returning here again & would reccommend it to anyone looking for a hotel in Dublin city! 👌👌,5,2016,08,20
211,Best hotel we every stayed in,"We stayed here earlier in the year while my mother was in hospital and found the staff to be the most friendly, helpful and caring people. the really went out of their way for us.  We just stayed for 3 nights as part of a holiday and again found the staff very friendly and welcoming - and even remembered we'd been there before and asked for my mam!!  It is a beautiful hotel,  very comfortable, very clean and the food is great.  Near the city.  All boxes ticked so I cant see us staying anywhere else again.  Would definitely recommend to all.",5,2016,08,20
211,Great stay for a family of 5,"Wonderful hotel in Dublin that actually caters for families with more than 2 children. A rare place to find. Great sized rooms with all the facilities you need, tidy and clean.
Staff more than welcoming and our children loved their dinner and breakfast. So good to find somewhere in a city that works for the slightly bigger family. Thank you Croke Park!",5,2016,08,20
211,"Excellent, spotless, friendly",The staff were welcoming the moment you stepped inside A woman called Sophia was on reception and gave excellent attentive customer service. The rooms are immaculate and look as if they have been fitted last week The food at breakfast was amazing and great value Couldn't have been a better place to stay for us We would recomended and definitely come again Thanks ,5,2016,08,19
211,we enjoyed our stay,"Friendly staff, clean room and good beds. We had a lovely stay, the city centre is easily reachable with public transport or a taxi. Also a very good breakfast. The only thing we didn't like was the dirtiness (sticky floor, cups everywhere) of the bar after a sport game at the croke park stadium.",4,2016,08,19
211,What a pleasure....,"Checked in here on the 16th for 3 nights...getting ready to go home now after an amazing three nights.

Loved the complimentary hot towels at check in..were needed. Girls & guys behind the desk are so professional & really friendly. 

As we were recently engaged, the hotel delivered a bottle of prosecco to our room, which definitely went down well. 

Massive thank you to the concierge who tried to get us a taxi, even going out on the road to get one for us. 

Rooms up to high standard. Bed so comfy and loved the separate bath and shower. Accommodation staff very friendly. 

Hotel about a 15 minute walk to the city centre and across the road from Croke Park Stadium. 

Highly recommend to anyone and will be back!!",5,2016,08,19
211,Excellent Stay,"We are a family with young children, the moment we step into the hotel we experiment the excellent service from reception. The hotel staffs were very friendly and helpful to make sure we have a great stay. The room was clean and comfortable for our family, although we had a room facing the main street yet it was quiet at night for a good sleep. We also enjoyed the breakfast and the dinner at the restaurant, they had variety options and reasonably priced, we ordered grill beef, salad, fish finger and vegetable soup, smoothie and fresh fruit salad, all tasted good and kids loves their meal too. The Croke Park Hotel is a good choice for our family and we would love to stay here again if we visit Dublin in the future.    ",5,2016,08,19
211,Enjoyable Stay,"Good hotel with a bit of a walk into the city but you can catch a bus about 5 mins away. No doubt an excellent hotel for any event happening opposite in Croke Park!
I agree with the other reviewer who commented about the large sport screens, I found them distracting and would have preferred less of them. Good bar food, bit serves and gluten free.  All staff we encountered were excellent especially Philip who went out of his way to help us with an issue we had with a sister hotel in Cork. He was very professional and helpful. Thank you.",4,2016,08,19
211,Great stay,"Brilliant hotel, with great staff, who were polite and helpful. Great facilities and well appointed bedrooms. Room service was prompt and food lovely and fresh.  
 It's a bit of a walk into the centre,but manageable. Would stay again if we went back to Dublin.",5,2016,08,18
211,Michael O Meara,"We stayed here this week for 3 nights,on arrival we were upgraded to a suite as it was my wife's birthday, this hotel is truly amazing,great staff, particular mention for Hollie working in the bar,she was so friendly and so kind to our 2 children,the suite was top class and we had an executive lounge to relax, which included complimentary food and refreshments.
The food at the hotel was excellent.
We can highly recommend this hotel and we wish to thank management and staff for our wonderful stay
Thanks again 
Michael O Meara",5,2016,08,18
211,"Can I give it an ""excellent +"" rating?","What a lovely hotel. Reception staff/ concierge was attentive to our every need and excellent directions and recommendations for dinner.  The room was large and immaculate, the bathroom sparkling clean (one of my biggest gripe is bathrooms that are not detail cleaned...this was!).  Parking is secure and free, located under the hotel. We were attending a hurling match the day we checked out and were able to leave the car in the garage all day.  Overall fantastic experience!",5,2016,08,18
211,Far away,"The hotel was a hike from downtown. It's also directly across the street from a stadium and the night I stayed, thousands of fans seemed to converge in the hotel bar downstairs. The hotel itself is nice though - very modern and the staff are very friendly.",3,2016,08,18
211,Obsession with football? This is the place for you! ,"I have stayed here a few times on business.  Overall I like it - the rooms are well appointed and the staff friendly.  The biggest issue is the obsession with football in the bar....massive screen at one end, always full of kids in football strip eating chicken nuggets and chips (or something similar) and is so loud with another screen at the other end which means if you want a quiet drink, or to have a conversation there is no where else to go.  As a single woman on business with zero interest in football and not looking to spend an evening with a bunch of kids after work when I want a glass of wine after supper, it's very strange that this is on to the exclusion of everything else on the 5 or 6 times I've been here over the past few months.  There are quiet areas in the lobby but you can't get served a drink there.  Very odd.",3,2016,08,16
211,Short few days,"This hotel is very quaint and conveniently located near the Croke Stadium! It's about a 10 minute walk to the city center, but very easy to get there! I was a little shocked with how strict the security was for one of the nights! Wanted to know my room number, to see my key and also an ID! I don't know if this is be of an event going on or if this was protocol! All and all, this is a great hotel! Definitely recommend! ",5,2016,08,15
211,Fantastic Hotel ,"We stayed here for the Tipp Galway hurling semi final.  We arrived at 11.30 to find our room ready even though check in is usually 2pm, which was a great start to our day. Our room was very nice. We stayed in an executive room on the 4th floor.  The bathroom was big and very clean. The room had a fridge/mini bar, bathrobes and complimentary slippers and a view over the courtyard below. The bed was so comfy and the pillows were perfect.  We ate in the room after the match as it was extremely busy down stairs.  We had the burger and chips. Delicious.  The bar was very busy after the match but there were a lot of staff on and we were served very quickly. When we came down for breakfast the next morning the whole lobby and bar area was gleaming.  I can only guess at how much harder work went on during the night. Breakfast was not disappointing with both hot and continental breakfast available.  This is the best venue in Dublin if going to a match. Will definitely be back. ",5,2016,08,15
211,Fantastic hotel ,"Fantastic hotel with exceptional service. Hotel was clean and staff were friendly and helpful. Concierges were extremely knowledgable and gave great advice on places to visit. Hotel is a short bus ride out of town but you do need to walk 5-10 minutes up the road to catch a bus (there is also a transfer bus runs a few times a day if you pay for the Dublin bus tours). Room was lovey, bed was comfortable and had a great nights sleep. Toiletries provided were great quality (white company), would gladly stay again and would recommend. ",5,2016,08,15
211,Very good hotel with amazing staff,"This hotel is located over the road from the Croke Park stadium so if you're attending a sports event or concerts it's the optimal choice. The rooms are very clean and spacious as is the bathroom. The breakfast selection is varied and every item in the buffet is fresh and of the highest quality. The biggest plus is the cheerful and extremely knowledgable staff. We were mainly dealt with by a young lady called Sophia, who went out of her way to make us feel welcome and to answer our many questions. 

The only small criticism concerns the beds, which whilst comfortable are of the sort that move away from the headboard, thereby trapping the pillows in the resulting gap. ",5,2016,08,15
211,Very nice hotel with very friendly staff,"I stayed in Croke Park Hotel for 3 nights with my daughter. We had a very nice and qiet room on the 4th Floor that included an Executive Lounge that we could use at our convenience. The staff was very friendly and responded to our Needs, such as an additonal blanket, immedietaly. I can only recommend Corke Park Hotel for a Dublin visit. The hop-on-hop-off bus has a stop directly in front of the Hotel which is very convenient.",5,2016,08,14
211,The Place to Stay if You're Going to Croke Stadium,"This is a very nice hotel -- clean and well appointed. Our room was very large and had a separate shower and tub. This hotel is right across the street from Croke Stadium. This hotel is not within walking distance to downtown Dublin, but it is on the Hop-On Hop-Off 'blue' line. Highly recommend this hotel. It was the nicest we stayed in during a trip to Ireland and Scotland.",5,2016,08,14
211,A great experience,"My wife and I recently stayed at the Croke Park Hotel in Dublin, and I wanted to let them know about our visit.  We arrived already tired from travel, having been to England and Slovakia already in the previous two weeks. The reception staff was very friendly, and got us into our room.  Little did we know, the stadium across the street was hosting a big game, with 82,500 fans in attendance. The restaurant was crowded, the bar was crowded, but still, the hotel took care of guests first. It was great. The best part of our stay, though, was the concierge Orla who went over and above to find, and also book, a salon for my wife to get her nails done. It was close, affordable, and friendly. Orla also related to us as if we had been friends for years. She said it was just her doing her job, but if more people did their job like that, what an efficient and happy world it would be!  Thank you very much.",5,2016,08,14
211,Factored In,"I would agree with other reviewers that the hotel is very good and there is a high level of customer service.  However, potential guests would need to consider that it is about 20-25 minutes walk to the city centre and the environs (apart from the stadium) are not overly scenic.  A taxi is about 13 euro to the city centre.  The car park is in the basement of the hotel and the parking ticket has to be validated by reception (prior to leaving) to avoid charges.  Breakfast is 12 euro (if pre-paid when checking in) or 15 euro (if not pre-paid).  Breakfast is buffet style and ok.  There are few cafes near by.

Very good hotel but distance from city centre and cost of breakfasts needs to be factored in.",4,2016,08,12
211,"excellent hotel, great staff and well worth every penny","stayed for 5 days recently, comfy rooms, great food (really good!!), staff were helpful and always willing to help with any requests, very relaxing stay and will definitely return. Next to Croke Park which adds to it's character, managed to catch a hurling game on our trip and excellent atmosphere, 5 minutes by bus from the centre of Dublin and great place to stay. book it now you won't regret it, we didn't!",5,2016,08,12
211,God Hotel,"I stay in a lot of hotels in Europe as part of my business, this hotel, in my opinion is very good. I have stayed there three times so far and it has now become my 'go to' Hotel in Dublin. The prices are reasonable, its family friendly and clean.",5,2016,08,11
211,Brilliant as always ,"Have stayed here once before and once again, this hotel never fails to impress. Friendly staff upon arrival who will help you in every way they possibly can and will also go that extra mile. Easy and quick check in and out. The room was very spacious and clean - definitely worth the price. Very good selection of breakfast and you can order special requests from the kitchen too - everyone is very happy to help! Good location, and there is a free shuttle from outside the hotel which takes you straight to the city centre.",5,2016,08,11
211,Very good stay,"Stayed at the croke park hotel recently for one night . Check in was friendly and quick , room was spotless and well equipped .. Had a room service dinner and the quality of the food was very good . All in all a very good experience , price was reasonable enough . Would recommend .",4,2016,08,11
211,"Fab surroundings, great food!","dined here & was delighted. Got decent sized portions, only flaw is that the beef was a bit  thick and rubbery, Loved the meal otherwise. Nice friendly staff which is always a reason to visit. Would return in the future to come with no hesitation.",4,2016,08,11
211,It does the job,"I stayed at the Croke Park hotel for a work trip.  The Staff were very helpful and they are geared up to help with things like printing documents, etc.

I was working for a day at Croke Park Stadium so it was also the shortest commute I've ever had in my life!  Although slightly out of the way, cabs arrived very quickly every time we asked for one to be ordered.  We didn't try the restaurant but the bar food was really nice and the bar itself is great place to unwind after a days work.

The room was clean and spacious although my tv didn't work.  

I would stay here again for work.",4,2016,08,08
211,Fantastic hotel,"My family and I had the most fantastic break at this hotel, the room was clean and well equipped and we were overlooking Croke Park. The staff could not have been more helpful nothing was too much trouble and the concierge was outstanding, he definitely went out of his way to help us, in short we felt completely spoilt and cannot wait until our next visit!",5,2016,08,07
211,Croke Park Hotel,First class hotel.  The staff  were very welcoming and accommodating.  Rooms were spotless and spacious and bathroom was really nice and modern.    Would defo recommend this hotel and couldn't have been happier with our experience.,5,2016,08,07
211,Out of way hotel---but nice,"Nice place. Wish we knew it was 30 minutes out of Dublin Center, walking.  I should have investigated more. Also booked room via Expedia and apparently it included breakfast. We learned this after the third day.  Missed opportunity for us and left bad taste (no pun) about hotel management who first didn't let us know at check-in (apparently they claim in small print in email confirmation) and then they didn't seem interested in adjusting our $200 per night fee a bit because we didn't take advantage of it.  That's too bad.  Again, the hotel missed opportunity to have satisfied customer. This is why I rated hotel a 3.  Gotta earn the higher rating.  Stay closer to town.",3,2016,08,06
211,Great stay at a lovely hotel!,"We have just returned home from a week-long trip to Dublin, during which we stayed at the spectaculat Croke Park Hotel. Rooms were spacious, very clean, and perfect for our family of 3 (our son is 4 1/2). Front desk staff were very accomodating and helpful. Easy walk into downtown Dublin, and of course the best of locations during GAA events! Restaurant's and bar were both terrific. Only slight downside was that we had no USB outlets in the room, so make sure you bring your adapters if you are visiting from the U.S. Great holiday stay!",5,2016,08,06
211,Excellent,"Besides the location across the stadium, this is just a fantastic hotel. Perfect service, very good rooms, breakfast and parking made our stay very good. The price is upper level and raised to unpayable for a second visit, caused by bank holiday and GAA event. Local bus stop nearby, footwalk to city 20 min.",5,2016,08,04
211,Good hotel and excellent staff.,"The hotel is located not  far away from downtown as I initially thought. If you want to walk you find The Spire after a 20-25 minute walking.  In any case, you can easily get the hotel by taxi and public transportation.
What I liked best was the service in the restaurant that I attended 4 times for dinner. People there are really friendly and very special. That's why I wrote down the names of some of them (Ana, Ellen, Andrew, Collin).  I truly recommend this hotel.",4,2016,08,03
211,First class hotel and service,"Booked through Paige, who was most helpful.
On arrival Ian checked us in and he was very friendly.
Our room was on the fourth floor which gives you access to a beautiful executive room. Here you can enjoy tea, coffee, juices, breakfast items, fruit and cookies complimentary.
Our room was spotless with a view of a canal. Big enormous comfy bed and good sized bathroom with a shower and bath separate.
Turn down service in the evening is lovely. A chocolate, slippers and curtains pulled all adds to your stay.
Breakfast is a buffet help yourself with fresh honey. There is an excellent selection on offer. You can order porridge if you want.
Sorcha was very helpful and friendly at breakfast.
A taxi into Dublin is roughly 8 or 9 euros. We also walked in during the day. It takes us roughly 15 munutes to O'Connell street.
We had a few drinks in the bar at Croke Park hotel. Aisling served us and is a real gem. Always amiling and very very friendly. I can't praise her enough.
Overall The Croke Park is fantastic. I hope to return again
Thank you for a lovely stay.",5,2016,08,02
211,Fantastic! ,"I was recently staying at the Croke park hotel with a friend and I have to say that it was a great hotel in the centre of Dublin, The staff were very welcoming, cleanliness of rooms and dining were all top notch! I think for the price and what we received it was great VALUE! My next visit to Dublin I will definitely stay here again! 

",5,2016,08,01
211,Staff atThe Croke Park Hotel are 5*,"On arrival at The Croke Park Hotel you are met and greeted by warm smiling faces from staff on reception and concierge. All hotel staff cannot do enough to help make your stay comfortable and stress free. We ate both nights in the hotel - food in the Bar and the Restaurant was SUPERB quality. My husband and I were staying with my parents who are 80+ and everyone went out of their way to ensure they were well looked after. I could not recommend a more friendly hotel in Dublin. As a family we have stayed for over 30 years in The Westbury - but The Croke Park Hotel staff  are more friendly, helpful and genuinely care for the hotel guests. The bedrooms as clean, comfortable and spacious as those in The Westbury. The only slight downside is the location of the hotel for shopping - but a very short taxi ride costing between €12- €15 sorts that out. The Croke Park Hotel is a wonderful hotel with true 5* Staff. I would truly recommend the hotel to everyone. ",5,2016,08,01
211,Great Reception and Hotel,"Visited twice in a week. First was 1 night and the stay was flawless. Second visit was during a sporting activity and the hotel staff did a great job of keeping everyone safe, the hotel clean, assisting with guest needs, and maintaining a calm environment even though there were so many folks visiting the hotel. Job well done. ",5,2016,08,01
211,Very impressed!,"Don't have too much to add that has not been mentioned by others, agree staff is top notch.  If you can,  stay on the 4th floor as you receive the continental breakfast in the lounge as well as complimentary drinks.  Turn down service is wonderful.  Only thing I missed was a magnifying mirror in the bathroom.  All in all very remarkable hotel.",5,2016,08,01
211,Outstanding Irish hospitality,An outstanding hotel in the center of Dublin. Incredible rooms and dining. An outstanding value. The staff were very friendly and helpful. Dining options are great and he free parking is a huge plus. We really couldn't ask for more,5,2016,07,31
211,Easy Stay,"The Croke Park employees took good care of us from the moment we got there. We arrived extremely jet lagged and they were unable to give us our room right away, but were very helpful in finding things for us to do. The continental breakfast at the Side Bar may be one of the best I've had! ",4,2016,07,30
211,Comforts of Home,I was so thrilled with my stay here. The beds are so comfortable. Bathrooms clean with fluffy towels. Right across from Croke Park stadium! It is close to city centre but if you are coming or going after dark I would recommend a taxi. The breakfast buffet is amazing! They even had a fresh honeycomb! Would love to stay here again. ,5,2016,07,30
211,Home away from home,"We just returned from a 7-day vacation in Ireland; throughout our stay, we made The Croke Park Hotel our temporary home. Upon arrival, we were upgraded to the club level and enjoyed a lovely breakfast and snacks each day. 

The staff was wonderful....not a bad one in the bunch!

The bar and restaurant areas are very cozy and inviting, especially after a long day of playing golf and or visiting family. Get the fish and chips.....they're awesome.

The location of the hotel could  not be better since everything is a short walk away. If you prefer not to walk, a multitude of buses and cabs are easy to hail. Another great tip,  is that the nicest (ie not cheesy) hop on, hop off bus tour makes a stop, right in front of the hotel. 

If you are looking for a great hotel that is perfect for your family get away, look no further than The Croke Park Hotel.",5,2016,07,30
211,First night in Dublin,"We stayed here upon arrival in Dublin before commencing on our tour.  We arrived early but couldn't get into our rooms until about 1pm.   Not to worry, we just took a nice walk toward the city center.  All staff members were friendly and helpful.  The room was comfortable and quiet; and the breakfast buffet had something for everyone.  I highly recommend this hotel.",5,2016,07,29
211,Super Service,"Great hotel, 7 min walk from train station and directly opposite Croke Park. Greeted by fantastic reception and a lovely fresh face cloth.  Room was large and bright, beds very comfortable. Ensuite had shower and bath. Had food in Bar and both the service and meals were excellent. Will be back and would recommend as a place to stay. Very child friendly also,had my 2 children age 6 and 11, they loved it. Thank you.",5,2016,07,29
211,Really pleasant stay,"This was my second stay at the croke park hotel as a short stay business visitor.  I was delighted to have been upgraded!  The security at this hotel seems well thought out and whilst my company uses this for business guests it appears to be a very popular hotel for USA and Canadian visitors.  The food is really quite good from what I remembered of my last visit but on this occasion I just took breakfast which was marvellous!  The hotel staff are really helpfuland the rooms offer a very comfortable nights sleep!  The bathroom was well cleaned and practical with both a bath and separate shower cubical, toiletries provided!  All round a pleasant stay!",4,2016,07,29
211,Luxury hotel close to the Dublin action.,"Ladies and Gentlemen, 
I stay at several 4 and 5 star hotels in Europe regularly for business and pleasure, many other hotels as a one-time stay, and this little hotel is a gem and quite a surprise. I can't think of a better experience that I have had anywhere.  I think the management is looking out for the well-being of both staff and guests. One can plainly see the staff are happy with their jobs- and this happiness is felt immediately upon arrival. I am amazed at the pride they have taken in their daily work and the ownership they have in the customer experience. This is now my go-to hotel in Dublin. I'm looking forward to my next stay there. 
Sincerely,
Devin in Germany",5,2016,07,29
211,Great Day in Dublin,SUPERB BREAKFAST AT GREAT VALUE because we only paid for adults and kids eat free! 24 euros for every breakfast item you can imagine! That was 6 euros each! What? Amazing  EASY access to hop on hop off bus tour and we bought our tickets right at the hotel. Gary was so helpful and all the staff members! ,5,2016,07,28
211,Good hotel ,This is a really nice hotel about 20 minutes walk from the centre of Dublin. All the staff were very friendly and helpful. The room was spacious and the bed very comfortable. Hotel has free parking in their secure underground car park and is only 15 minutes drive from the port. ,5,2016,07,28
211,"""Clean, close to downtown""","Our family of four stayed at Croke Park for a couple of nights.  The room was very comfortable and clean and we slept well.  The breakfast buffet was a bit limited and it was confusing at times who the server was and we had to ask a couple of waitstaff for items that should have taken little time to get.  Likewise, the food in the bistro was good but the service was slow.  It seemed like there was either a shortage of staff or disorganization, because the servers, although friendly and polite, all around seemed a bit flustered at times with their role.  We would still recommend this hotel for the clean, quiet layout, free parking, and ease both getting to town and airport, but think the restaurant needs revamping of the service delivery. ",4,2016,07,27
211,Our Family Loved It,"The Croke Park is not in the center of everything, but the staff makes you feel like you are. Great rooms at a very competitive price. The staff are very attentive and helpful. For a family of 4 it is wonderful to be able to get a room with 3 beds. The breakfast is  excellent, a great deal, and kids are free with an adult. You can certainly walk downtown from the hotel, but it is less than 10 euros to take a cab. We would certainly recommend this hotel to any and all friends visiting Dublin.",5,2016,07,27
211,Return visit just as fantastic as the first,"I have to say this hotel has turned out to be our wee slice of heaven... We were there last year for 1st time and booked again to return for 4 night in July 2016... My 2 kids had asked Paige in reservations if we could have same room as last year and you can imagine the excitement this year when reception staff handed us the keys to room 111 when we arrived...(our room from last year)... The rooms are spotless, the beds are so comfy and the staff are amazing.... We had room service for dinner twice as kids enjoyed it so much... The cheese and ham toasted sandwich on sourdough bread and the bbq pulled pork were out of This world... The restaurant staff go above and beyond... Bringing my son Nutella every morning to have with his croissants along with his hot chocolate... For breakfast there are cereals, porridge, fresh fruit, toast, cooked breakfast, range of pastries and range of fruit juices.... The reception, housekeeping and restaurant staff are all fantastic and the standard of service you receive is 5 star.... We're coming back in August for a girly night with daughter and her friend and her mum and we can't wait",5,2016,07,27
211,Great value!,"Clean, renovated and well kept together with outstanding service made this hotel my new go-to hotel in Dublin. This is one of the best value hotels i've found in Dublin and I highly recommend it to anyone (business/family).",5,2016,07,27
211,"Wonderful staff, location and beds!","This hotel is very nice, the staff was extremely accommodating.  The location is good with publis transportation and easy taxi rides to most areas.  The only suggestion is that the dining is not very good, breakfast was included, stick to yogurt, fruit and croissants!  The bar was great with knowledgeable staff.  Beds were fabulous.",4,2016,07,26
211,Perfect place to stay,"If you need a place to stay, with the knowledge that you wont be disappointed, the this is the place for you. The staff really know how to make you feel welcome. The Concierge will be able to guide you on where to visit, what to see and the best way to get there.

This isn't my first visit, I was originally there on business, but since then I've revisited on a regular basis. The staff really do excel in making you feel that you are being pampered at home, and that's where you are in a home from home. 

Love the place and would recommend it to anyone. Believe me you wont be disappointed.",5,2016,07,26
211,Weekend Break,"A fantastic hotel in Dublin City and only 10 minute walk from city center.
Well kept hotel with great rooms a good atmosphere and friendly staff. Would highly recommend this and will definitely return . 👍",5,2016,07,25
211,Very nice hotel/staff,"The hotel is a bit out of the center of Dublin though just across the street from the GAA (???) stadium, great for Irish sports fans.  The room was well sized and quiet.  Breakfast quite good and abundant.  The staff were really friendly and helpful.  A good Indian restaurant and a good creperie are a short walk away along the canal.",5,2016,07,24
211,Quality hotel long way from centre ,"Lovely hotel, it's quiet as its off the main streets, has a real up market feel and staff help to make this very special. Only draw back is it a long way from the town centre, 5 mins by car (no traffic) or a long walk. Ideal for the stadium but not really a Dublin City hotel. ",4,2016,07,24
211,"Close to being very good, let down by dated rooms.","This hotel has a very boutique feel about it on entry. The reception area is large, provides very comfortable seating and the staff were all very pleasant. I was impressed with the styling and comfort of the ""communal areas"", all adding to the boutique feel. 

What lets the hotel down for me were the rooms. Whilst they are perfectly comfortable, air conditioned and very clean, they are a little dated and didn't seem to fit with the rest of the hotel. If management are reading this, a simple but effective change would be to update the carpets/curtains in the rooms to match that of the corridors. This would help lift the rooms from looking like they are from the 90s (which they may well be). Further, the mini bar was not fully stocked in my room, although room service where prompt when I called asking for a bottle of water. For these couple of reasons, dropping 1 star.

Breakfast good value for 12 Euros, checkin/checkout a smooth process. Due to the rooms, I would probably try a different hotel next time I visit Dublin (was on a business trip), however would also recommend you give this close consideration assuming nightly rate reasonable.",4,2016,07,23
211,Great Stay,"I stayed at the croke park hotel as I visited Dublin to attend the GAA Football Leinster final at Croke Park between Dublin and West Meath.

The hotel is situated right outside Croke park and is about 15 minutes on the bus from Dublin airport. The number 41 or 16 bus you can get outside the arrivals area and if you get off at Drumcondra station you have a 5-10 minute walk to the hotel. The Bus fare was only 3 euro.

Dublin city centre is only about a 15 minute walk from the hotel.

The check in and warm welcome was excellent, the rooms are very well equipped and the beds are very comfortable. The breakfast was buffet a style and you have everything from full cooked Irish breakfast and congenital style.

Service was great, nothing was to much trouble and I found all the staff very friendly and accommodating.

I would defiantly stay again and would highly recommend this hotel to anyone visiting Dublin.",5,2016,07,23
211,Friendly Hotel.,"We stayed for an overnight break including evening meal and stadium tour. Rooms were comfortable, food particularly breakfast was v good.Parking is handy as hotel is in easy walking distance to city centre. An enjoyable visit and would recommend.",4,2016,07,22
211,"Great hotel value, not so convenient location","I was very happy with Croke Park.Great hotel amenities, especially the fitness center. Beautiful room, but no ""views"" to speak of. Only had breakfast in the bistro, self serve buffet was only fair, and took a while to get a cup of coffee. Main issue was the location, so-so neighborhood a good walk to the city center, but never felt insecure.",4,2016,07,22
211,provision for food,"We went to the hotel planning on receiving a sit down meal in the resturant or bar food only to be informed by a staff that the only food available that evening was outside ! I watched as it took a full hour for people get anything to eat from the out door area.. 

For a hotel in such a prime location with ablity to provide for meeting and conferences  I have to say I was extremely disappointed with the service for food available and the way the place was being organised on such a busy Friday evening ..",1,2016,07,22
211,Great hotel,"VERY friendly and helpful staff. Very nice hotel and amenities. Close enough to walk to downtown. REALLY LIKED THE PLACE. Would recommend without hesitation. Note that it is across the street from the stadium, if that's a problem for you.",5,2016,07,22
211,Excellent service,"We stayed at this hotel for two nights in July of 2016. What impressed us the most was the high quality service, from checking in to checking out. The staff were very friendly and helpful. We got great tips of what to do and see in Dublin. Small things matter: upon arrival we got a warm towel to clean and refresh our faces. We also used the gym, which was clean and well equipped. Beds were very comfortabel. A 15-20 min walk to the center of the city. Highly recommendabel.",5,2016,07,20
211,Kind generous welcoming staff,"I would recommend this hotel both for business and for staying with your family.  The staff make it.  I mean the food, gym, rooms, executive lounge and wine list are super but really its the kindness and welcoming nature of the staff that has made this hotel my go-to hotel for Dublin.  Following my children's first stay here this weekend, they've asked if we can always stay here.",5,2016,07,19
211,Great hotel and excelent restaurant,"our visit went really easy, the rooms are nice, the executive level offers limit breakfast, sometimes even when suppose to start at 7am it doesn't and is not really the best if you are taking an early excursion, but otherwise is nice, they have during the day water and juices there as part of the executive lounge.
The hotel is in front of the soccer stadium, 10 minutes by taxi to the center, 10-12 euros. The restaurant is excellent, had really good food and good prices, we love it.",5,2016,07,18
211,Croke park hotel,"This is a wonderful place with reasonable rates, decent bar food and the friendliest desk staff. The concierge, Christopher , was exceptionally patient and kind to us. We were very grumpy after a grueling rush-hour drive from Connemara . Christopher recommended the bar for our late dinner, mapped out a route for our one day in Dublin, and reserved Fallon and Byrne for our last dinner in Ireland --thanks!!",5,2016,07,17
211,Nice place to stay for a family ,"Hi the three of us stayed here for three nights. Great service, superb meal in the restaurant and very child friendly. Not far from the city and near all the main routes.

One tip for guests - get you carpark ticket validated at the reception before you exit the car park otherwise you have to pay up to 20 euro.",5,2016,07,17
211,Anniversary Visit,"Once again The Croke Park Hotel has been a lovely experience.  This is our 5th visit and this time we were upgraded to access to the Executive Lounge which was very very nice.
My only probem.   this  time is with the website I used to book our stay - Booking.com.  The quote was in £sterling.  I use both Hotel.com and Booking.com and the usual quote is in the currency of the country where the hotel is located. As I was booking a hotel in Dublin I did not bother to check and was quoted 307 which turned out to be sterling and converted to €397 - a lot more than I intended to spend!!  However that's the fault of the website in question and I emailed them to that effect = how ridiculous to quote a hotel in Dublin Ireland in sterling.  However, the lovely stay in the hotel have helped negate my annoyance.  Again, well done Croke Park.",5,2016,07,15
211,Excellent,"Just stayed four nights at The Croke Park and wanted to say how much we really enjoyed it. The staff were so helpful and friendly and really go the extra mile for you. The rooms were big and spacious and immaculately kept. The food is wonderful and probably some of the best food I have ever had. Overall we (myself, wife and four year old) had a fantastic stay here and wouldn't hesitate to book again next time we visit Dublin.",5,2016,07,15
211,Highly recommended ,"Stayed here on a weekend break to Dublin for 2 nights with my 2 sisters and mum. Got a good rate for two twin rooms through link on TripAdvisor (less expensive than my bookings.com genius rate).

Was a little apprehensive about it being out of the the city, but this was much preferable than being in the centre with noisy hen and stag parties. The location was perfect. Not too far and not too near.

Our rooms were next to each other, opposite the lifts (wasn't too noisy) and with a view to stadium (which was OK as it wasn't match day.) Rooms were spacious with comfy beds and air con (although we didn't need it as it was much cooler than anticipated and it rained for most of the weekend!!)

The bathroom was big, with separate bath and shower. Shower was powerful and lovely white company toiletries were supplied. There wasn't a magnifying mirror for putting on make-up and lighting wasn't very bright. My sisters' shower was too hot and they were unable to adjust temperature. They mentioned this to reception and it got fixed straight away.

We ate in the restaurant on the first night. Lovely food. I had the steak, which was yummy. Great service. Good wine.

On the second night we ate in the nearby Italian restaurant (recommended on TripAdvisor). Again, highly recommended, delicious food and a two minute walk down the same road as the hotel.

We got a 2 day bus pass for the on-off tour bus (stopped right outside the hotel, didn't run evenings). Reasonably priced and a great way to see the city. Did lots of exploring and shopping - lots of birthday pressie shopping for one sister, holiday clothes shopping for me and we all bought umbrellas from a tourist shop! 

Everyone we met was really friendly and everywhere catered for gluten-free foodies like me. (A real plus for me as didn't feel like the 'odd one out').

Loved Dublin - will definitely return when there's better weather and stay at Croke Park again. Thank you to all the staff who made our stay so enjoyable. 
",4,2016,07,13
211,I would stay here again if ever back in Dublin!,"Quiet area away from down town. Friendly, pleasant and helpful staff: from front desk to housekeeping.  The room was clean and modern. Working wifi was a plus. Only had breakfast there and it was very good. You won't walk away hungry!",5,2016,07,12
211,Not mentioned in Dublin/Ireland travel books but should be!,First this hotel is not included in Ireland travel books and what a shame.  It is a hidden treasure.  We originally booked 2 rooms for our family of 5 at The Westbury but ended up going to Dublin one day earlier for a hurling match and couldn't add that date at The Westbury.  We booked a place with Airbnb and it had cleanliness issues so found this hotel right across from Croke Park.  It is owned by the same company as The Westbury and it is less expensive.  While it is further from downtown Dublin it is still within walking distance and the room savings and free underground parking can more than make up the cost of taxis.  We had a family room with 2 double beds and 1 single bed that was perfect for our three sons and they got the executive floor.  The breakfast was also worth the money and the food was good.  It was also an easy drive to the airport for our flight back to the States.,5,2016,07,12
211,Lovely Hotel!,"The room is nice and has air conditioning. There is a double and well as a twin bed in our room. Across the bed is a small table and chair and a long desk with a chair. There was a radio and CD player which was a nice feature.
The bathroom had a tub and separate shower and a vanity with some storage. There were large bath sheet size towels and this hotel did have wash cloths. 
There was no top sheet on the bed but the bed had a thin comforter. The bed was very comfortable.
There was a closet with a built in ironing board and iron. There was plenty of lighting and outlets.
The breakfast was buffet and very nice, with many hot and cold choices.
The hotel is not in easy walking distance from the City Center, and you'd have to take a taxi.",5,2016,07,12
211,A classy hotel with comfortable rooms,"We stayed on the last night of a tour. it was a good hotel with a comfortable room but yet again only one suitcase rack for two people with two suit cases.
The breakfast was okay. The cereals where in an awkward place you had to reach across from a honey combe and other items which had been placed in front of the dispensers and so lots fo cereal  had been spilt as people attempted to fill their bowls.
The hot food had been out for some time so the eggs where hard, as was the bacon. 
The hotel had an inner courtyard and some people had sat outside until abut 12.30 a.m. disturbing guests talking loudly. This should not be allowed to happen.",4,2016,07,11
211,Excellent Stay in Dublin,"Our family of four stayed at the Croke Park Hotel in late June and it was outstanding in every way. The service was excellent with a very helpful concierge desk ready to help with anything that you could think of. The restaurant was convenient and very stylish with a great bar and huge fireplace along the far wall. On top of it all, the rooms were clean, spacious and modern. The hotel is also situated in a great spot. Close enough that we were able to walk downtown, but far enough that we didn't have to battle traffic when arriving in our rental car. 
This was the best hotel we stayed at during our two-week trip to Ireland.",5,2016,07,11
211,Great hotel for a reasonable price,"We greatly enjoyed the hotel and the available bus to the city center was a nice plus.
The rooms were clean, great breakfast which was included and friendly staff.
Though the hotel is a little out of the city center the restaurant in the hotel has good food and there are plenty of restaurants in walking distances.  Cabs and buses a readily available for a quick ride into the city.",4,2016,07,10
211,if a higher score existed they would get it.,"It is hard to put into words how helpful and kind the staff in this hotel are, because generally my reviews centre around holiday stays, on this occasion I had a very ill family member in the Mater hospital and needed to stay as close as possible to the hospital. due to the stressful nature of the stay, and the fact that we could not block book the rooms as there were a few days during the stay that the hotel was booked up, we had many many conversations with managers and staff members.  The staff went above and beyond to find us cancellations, to store bags and valuables when they were thought they would be unable to book a room, and somehow every time finding us a last minute room.  They were always on hand and always available to help and I can't thank them enough.  
To go on to review the hotel... it is stunning! As I have already explained we were at some stages of the stay moving around the hotel and taking any cancellation available and this allowed us to stay on the executive floor, on floor 01 and on floor 03.  All of these rooms are modern, spotlessly clean, so well serviced and so very comfortable. We ate in the restaurant, in the bar and also room service. It is fantastic value for money and every dish is presented beautifully even when you only order the sandwiches. The attention to detail and the service everywhere from the lounge to the breakfast room makes this a fantastic hotel to stay in and I definitely will be back but in better circumstances.",5,2016,07,10
211,Great base for a city break,"Stayed here last Friday night.  Rooms are large, nicely furnished and very comfortable. Lounge areas and bar welcoming and relaxed.  Friendly staff both on the front desk and in the bar.  We ate lunch in the restaurant and the food was top quality.  A 20 minute walk or 10 minute cab ride from the city centre.  Couldn't find any fault in the hotel, its facilities, location etc.  Would definitely stay here again.",5,2016,07,10
211,Two night CIE tour stay,"Wonderful rooms; very clean and modern. The staff are very nice and the breakfast was great. The only drawback was we wound up staying while Beyoncé was playing at the stadium opposite the hotel and, as such, traffic was a mess. Perhaps try to avoid the hotel during a concert. Otherwise, it is perfect! ",5,2016,07,09
211,Very nice hotel,"I stayed here recently on a lads weekend to Dublin. To my surprise the hotel is of a very high standard, especially good value for money. The location is ideal, as it's just a short walk to town and all the wonderful sites of Dublin.
I would most definitely stay here again, whether it's for business or pleasure. I must mention the staff, who were wonderfully polite, courteous and extremely helpful.
Highly recommended.",5,2016,07,08
211,Very Welcoming,"I stayed here for 10 days loved the food, room service and the facilities that were on offer within the hotel.  The staff were very informative. The one thing I would change is being able to pre pay for the meal service with my flight and hotel.  It would of made things a little easier. ",4,2016,07,08
211,Very welcoming hotel,"Celebrated our anniversary here and was greeted with two small bottles of bubbly in our room.
The staff were very friendly, the room was nice and clean and bed was comfortable.
Cannot fault breakfast - good selection and very delicious.
The hotel is right opposite croke park stadium, so very handy if you are going there, otherwise it is about a mile away from the tourist area and nightlife (which was what we wanted so we had peace and quiet at night). So if you want the nightlife right on your door step, this is not the hotel for you as it is located in a residential area.",5,2016,07,07
211,Great hotel in Dublin ,"We absolutely loved this hotel, we had a spacious room, very large bathroom, comfortable bed. The service was first class and extremely friendly. Dining room was quite nice and the breakfast was outstanding. The neighborhood is a bit off, but not seedy or anything. And frankly good walking distance to almost everything. ",4,2016,07,06
211,Good Hotel,"We stayed here for a 24-hour visit to Dublin and were very pleased.  The location was nice for us as it was close to the airport, outside of the city traffic, yet still walking distance to the city (about a mile away from city center).  There's also a hop on, hop off stop at the hotel. The staff was incredibly friendly and gave great directions.  Overall a really pleasant stay!",5,2016,07,06
211,Staff couldn't have been more helpful!,"The hotel was spotless, bathroom immaculate, and the room was spacious and comfortable. It was only a 15-minute walk to the city centre, which was fine for us. The reception and concierge staff couldn't have been more helpful, and we would definiteyl stay at The Croke Park when next in Dublin",5,2016,07,05
211,Birthday visit to Dublin,"For my 24th birthday we decided to visit Dublin, we chose to stay at the Croke Park hotel. We did not arrive at the hotel until gone 11pm and the staff were delightful! They offered us hot towels and asked if we needed anything at all for that evening. Once we opened the hotel door, there were two glasses and two mini bottles of Prosecco and a birthday card waiting for me, which was a lovely surprise!
The breakfast was great, a lot of choice and it was always nice and fresh! The waiters were very attentive and could not do enough for you! 
The hotel is a little walk (around 10-15 minutes) to O'connell street, but that wasn't a problem at all as we wanted to be just out from the busy streets.
The hotel facilities were great, and the hotel was always clean! Once we checked out, we were given two bottles of water and this was the perfect finishing touch!

Would highly recommend this hotel and we are already planning our trip to come back!",5,2016,07,05
211,Highly recommended ,"Very comfortable, clean, and modern hotel with friendly and knowledgeable staff  . Very good breakfast which was included in our room rate. The location is a €7 taxi ride from the main tourist areas, but factoring that in still a good value. We'll stay there again ",5,2016,07,05
211,A wonderful experience,"We were treated like kings from check-in until we checked out! A fantastic hotel with very friendly staff who cannot do enough for you. We arrived early so the staff kept our bags to allow us some time to explore the area. Check-in was quick and efficient by Tomislava who was very pleasant. The room itself was lovely and the beds were among the most comfortable I've experienced anywhere. We were then brought complimentary prosecco as we were celebrating two birthdays which was a very kind gesture from Catherine, the front office manager. The bathroom was extremely spacious with a bath tub and separate walk-in shower. Towels were changed everyday, even though we never requested this. Room service was very good. Staff never walked past us in corridors without asking how we were. The hotel was very clean and well maintained throughout.
Breakfast was also very good. A buffet style arrangement with nice food. The waiters and waitresses were also very pleasant and could not do enough for you. Breakfast is very much overpriced though at €14.95 if you don't have it included in your booking.
Checkout was also very quick and Tomislava gave us complimentary bottled water for our journey home.
Overall, a wonderful experience and I would definitely recommend this hotel. ",5,2016,07,05
211,Ideally situated for Croke Park Stadium,"On business trip, ideal for across the road at Venue, Croke Park.  Nice hotel, modern clean design and decor, friendly staff... A bit out of town 15-20Euro in a cab probably, 10-15min drive to Temple Bar & City Ctr attractions -",5,2016,07,05
211,"Great hotel, not great location","The hotel is great. Room is big and comfotable and the staff is really nice with a great quality WI-FI. Breakfast with full of fruit, breads and juices. For me, the worst part is the location I prefer other choices closest to the city centre. You need a taxi because the area around the hotel is not great for a walk. However if you are happy to use taxis, the hotel is really recommendable and I would be happy to repeat next time I visit Dublin.",4,2016,07,04
211,3 arena concert stay,"we stayed in the croke park as I was convenient to the 3 arena.This was our second stay at the croke park and will not be our last.A great hotel with exceptional staff.The choice of food
in the sideline bistro was also excellent.",5,2016,07,04
211,Top Class Hotel.,"Unbeatable security,first class facilities good location.
Very friendly helpful staff. Plentiful choice of menus 
Comfortable  and immensely clean.
Easy accessible free secure underground parking
Close to city centre good public transport handy as driving can be bit of a nightmare
Rooms brightly decorated and well furnished
All of requirements catered for.
Really enjoyable stay.",5,2016,07,04
211,Ms.,An excellent hotel!  The staff was friendly and helpful.  They went out of their way to make us comfortable.  The restaurant was very good as well!  We had a wonderful stay in Dublin - the hotel is quiet but within easy walking distance of the hub of the city.,5,2016,07,04
211,Great Hotel,"First time at The Croke Park and would highly recommend it. .The hotel is very comfortable, good value for money and has a great atmosphere. 
The food in the bistro was excellent and staff very attentive. 
Will definitely be back...",5,2016,07,04
211,Luxurious hotel,"We booked this trip which included flights and the hotel through LastMinute.com for around £370 which I thought was a very reasonable price for 2 people to stay 2 nights. When we arrived at the hotel we were checked in very quickly and were directed to our room. There was a water and ice dispenser in the corridor leading to our room. As we went in our room I was amazed at how beautiful the room was. There was a large TV with a stereo below, a large double and single bed, a stocked mini fridge, large heavy curtains that kept all the light out and I loved the bathroom! It had a separate bath and shower either side of the room and we were given lots of bottles of shampoo, shower gel and moisturiser. The bed was very comfortable and the pillows were lovely. I had 2 excellent night sleep in this hotel.

One thing I didn't like was how if you took something out of the mini fridge it charged your account automatically - even if you didn't eat/drink it. This was resolved at reception when we checked out but I just don't like how that system works. The room could also be a little noisy at night with people slamming doors and shouting in the corridor. 

I loved the touch of having a new magazine, and paper and envelopes for letters - excellent idea. I would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone and everyone. Thankyou!",5,2016,07,03
211,Excellent stay,"What a lovely hotel. The staff are attentive and friendly. The room was big enough for the 3 of us, and very comfortable.
Great bar with table service. 
Good location, between the airport and the city centre.
We will certainly use this hotel again.",5,2016,07,03
211,Affordable luxury in Dublin,We stayed at the Croke Park for our 5 days in Dublin.  Our room was on the smaller side but it was well appointed and the bed was very comfortable.  The bar and waitstaff in the lounge and the restaurant were very courteous and helpful during our stay.  The hotel is located directly across the street from the stadium but a short distance away from O'Connell street and the Grafton Street shopping area. The concierge service is very friendly and helpful in getting you a cab to take you downtown.  The Dublin hop on hop off bus also stops in front of the hotel a few times daily and can also get you downtown.,4,2016,07,02
211,Two day stay,"Checked in to Croke yesterday for a two night stay. I cannot speak highly enough about this hotel!! Everything is pleasing..staff, rooms ( have an executive room on the 4th floor...422) free parking, food is glorious and we are beside the hallowed ground of GAA. Taxi to central Dublin takes between 5-15 mins depending on traffic and is 8-15 euro. All in all, a great place to stay.",5,2016,07,01
211,excellent staff,"really nice welcome, big room. bland but nice lobby.
I had dinner in the bar which is extremely noisy and busy. the wait staff were extremely friendly and efficient. Dale, my waiter was just excellent. recommended quinoa salad which was really excellent and reasonably priced. The beds are comfortable and the hotel is 4 star without being hugely priced like a lot of dublin hotels. I really like the spot and would highly recommend in summer busy season as it is a little out of the city and half way to the airport.",4,2016,06,30
211,Perfect hotel,"Everything from the parking,food staff was absolutely perfect. The rooms were gorgeous,so clean & spacious. Catherine the manager was at reception & greeted us with a big smile. There was nothing that cud be at fault. Location,cleanliness,food,parking etc.. Was all 10 out of 10. 
Thanks for everything 
Michelle & family ",5,2016,06,30
211,Amazing Stay,"Me and my partner booked a three night stay here via their website and got a great deal. We got to the hotel four hours before we were meant to check in as that is when our flights got in and it only took us 15 minutes in a taxi to get to the hotel. Once we arrived we were upgraded free of charge to the executive floor and allowed to move into our room as soon as we got in. During our stay, all the staff were great including at breakfast which was yummy.
We loved it so much that we came back for one more night at the end of our trip. Once again it was amazing. The hotel is slightly out of the city centre but if you are willingly to walk in every day then this is the best hotel in Dublin!",5,2016,06,30
211,Expensive Breakfast,"I arrived in Dublin early and this was the only place open for food. There was great service and the staff was super helpful. However, the breakfast was super expensive and nothing special. It was all buffet style.",3,2016,06,28
211,Brilliant 3 night stay,I booked the Croke Park Hotel through a travel website. I didn't know a lot about this hotel I just took a gamble on the information I could find over the internet. I have to say this is an exceptional hotel with great staff and also a great location. I will definitely return to this hotel one day in the future as I have nothing but good memeories of the hotel. definitely recommend staying here when visiting Dublin,5,2016,06,28
211,Mrs Dempsey,"Thank you all so much we had fab time at Croke Park hotel the staff were so polite and helpful they could not do enough for you - thank you we will defo be back xx
Luxury hotel with great facilities           A great hotel for families couples and single people 
",5,2016,06,28
211,Simply the best,"Just spent 3 nights at what I must say is simply the best hotel I have ever stayed at (and I have travelled extensively ) .The service was of the highest caliber,the staff constantly friendly,and the highest standard of cleanliness.No one you passed in the corridors failed to wish you good morning.
The restaurant was very good,the bar and area friendly.
The overall feeling was not the normal stuffy one but always easy going friends at work,Thanks to all.
The only small drawback is the distance to O'Connell Street and Temple Bar (approx
a mile) 7 Euros cab fare ,20 mins walk.",5,2016,06,28
211,superb stay,"Everything spot-on - wonderful clean, comfortable, secure room, amazingly well-trained and helpful staff , great underground parking, not too far from city centre, great food! What a superb operation!  it's a shame that governments aren't run like this hotel!! So professional! Thank you!",5,2016,06,27
211,Nice hotel ,"Modern hotel with a nice lobby area. The rooms were modern and clean. There was a cd player in our room, we never used it but I'm sure it would have been appreciated by other guests. Breakfast was good with plenty of choice. Free parking. ",4,2016,06,27
211,Great base for exploring Dublin ,"Our three-night stay was terrific from start to finish. The rooms were comfortable, quiet, and spacious. Service was consistently pleasant and efficient. Food was good, I particularly enjoyed the quinoa salad for dinner. It's a 15 minute walk from town, and has the advantage of free parking. I would definitely stay there on a return visit.",4,2016,06,27
211,Very fine hotel,This hotel is very pleasant all around. Rooms are large and well presented and very comfortable. Very friendly and helpfull staff. The restaurant and bar are excellent. About a 10 minute walk to the main shopping and eating street. ,5,2016,06,27
211,Great hotel,"Had a wonderful room in a nicely located hotel.  Excellent service, great breakfast and very good food.  My husband and I were on a 3 week vacation of England and Ireland.  After staying in a not so good B & B in York England this was a wonderful change.  Comfortable bed, and a room with everything you could need.  I recommend this hotel based on the wonderful friendly service, comfort, location and food.",4,2016,06,26
211,Cozy and Comfortable,I stayed with a friend and the room was roomy for both of us with plenty of mirrors and outlets. The staff is pleasant and professional. They went out of their way to make us comfortable and assist us with taxis and sight seeing. The rooms are quiet for a good night's sleep and the beds are comfortable. The restaurant has great food and an inviting fireplace. The hotel is located just outside the city and you can walk or take a taxi. I can't wait to bring my husband next time! THANK YOU!,5,2016,06,25
211,Excellent,"Everything about this hotel ouses class,from the rooms to reception area.Good food in the bar/restaurant,served by very friendly staff.Green hop on bus shuttle picks up from outside hotel taking you into centre where all hop on services are available.Walk to top of Oconnell st takes about 15 mins.",5,2016,06,25
211,Came for a Joe Satriani (guitarist) concert and stayed here for the comfortable beds!,"Lovely hotel on the inside, visited in June 2016 - is around 15 minutes walk to the high street in town - and a pretty straightforward walk. Recommended for the friendliness of the staff and pretty straightforward service (highly recommend the Hennessy Paradis at the bar)! :)",5,2016,06,25
211,A wonderful skywalk and tour,"We spent around four hours touring Croke Park, the skywalk, the museum and then the stadium tour. Adam conducted the tour. He gave an excellent presentation and his knowledge of all areas was outstanding",5,2016,06,25
211,Outstanding,"Compared to a 5 star hotel we stayed in earlier in the week--this was cleaner with better rooms, friendlier, better food and service. Fitness room had about 50 dumbbells, 4 aerobic machines--OK but not the best I've seen.
   The really outstanding features that will bring me back are Ellen the waitress,Best I have experienced in my 50 years of extensive traveling.--great personality and extremely efficient and knowledgeable. Steve Brannigan,  the concierge, was very helpful--number 1 in my experience.
    The whole staff just couldn't do enough. Also great lounge on the executive floor.",5,2016,06,25
211,Great trip,We stayed at the Croke Park Hotel for six nights and it was excellent.  The food at the restaurant was good.  The room was clean and maintained well.  The business center was convenient and easy to use.  Only negative was how far it was from the city center but it was never a major issue.,5,2016,06,24
211,"Excellent hotel, best staff","Probably one of the best hotels in Dublin right now. Everything you would need for a pleasant stay. Reasonably priced. Best of all, the staff: friendly, efficient, professional. Highly recommend this hotel for business or pleasure",5,2016,06,24
211,Excellent!!,"My husband and I stayed at Croke Park Hotel for 4 nights visiting Dublin.  The hotel is very well maintained and the rooms are very clean and comfortable.  There were ample amenities in the room.  The entire staff was very accommodating, friendly and helpful.  We ate in the bar and had breakfast every morning in the dining room. A Dublin ""hop off hop on"" bus actually has a stop at the hotel so after day of sightseeing the bus takes you right to the hotel. It was a wonderful experience and we will certainly stay at the Croke Park the next time we visit.   ",5,2016,06,23
211,Great and friendly hotel,"This hotel was included in the packaged tour I booked in HK. Although the hotel is not large, everything is good enough for me. I should really appreciate for its gymnasium which was well equipped and most important “opened 24 hours a day”. I spent an hour in gymnasium in the very early morning because of the time sickness after taking a long haul flight.",5,2016,06,23
211,Brilliant Hotel,"Stayed here recently for business reasons. I was female traveling alone and I felt very safe and secure in this hotel, the staff were very warm and welcoming - there was a lovely feeling about the place, not like your typical Dublin city centre hotel. All facilities I used were top class. I would thoroughly recommend this hotel and I look forward to going back for business or leisure. Its perfect for both.",5,2016,06,22
211,Great Experience with Croke Park Hotel,"I've stayed in this hotel for a month as a part of a business engagement. The hotel can be easily accessible from the airport and from City Center. You can even walk in to the City center in just 15 minutes. You can pick a taxi from the airport or take a airport bus and drop down in the Drumcondra Lower bus stop. The hotel is just 5 minutes walk from the Drumcondra Lower bus stop. 

The hotel offers delicious break fast options, however it was a bit repetitive for me as it was a continuous stay. The bar attached to the hotel is very good. The Croke Park stadium is just a minute away.

You have great pubs (Eg: Quinns) is just 3 minutes away and Tesco, Spar are so close by. 

The rooms are really spacious and they have a great bathroom with a beautiful bathtub. They offer a free shuttle to east point business park every morning.

Over all my experience was superb and as always my experience with doyle group is awesome.

Cheers

211,Great hotel with easy access to city centre,Rooms were spacious and cosy and the gym was great too. Great location as it was within walking distance to the city centre. The breakfast buffet gave us a good start to the day and we thoroughly enjoyed our stay in this hotel.,5,2016,06,21
211,"Very friendly, helpful staff","It was perfect for what we wanted. Really nice staff who went out of their way to be helpful. It was clean and the rooms were nice and big.  For us it was a good location as it was a 10 minute or so walk out of the centre, which we really like.",5,2016,06,20
211,Excellent Hotel about 1.5 miles from the centre of Dublin,"Had another excellent weekend stay at the Croke Park Hotel to celebrate my wife's birthday. Half a bottle of Prosecco and an ice bucket as a courtesy from the management team was appreciated. Liked the new decor and branding at the hotel. As we had a Doyle's collection account we were given an upgrade to an Executive room on the 4th floor and use of the Executive Club area. This had a nice TV area with comfy chairs fresh juice and water and decent coffee and tea making facilities plus a help yourself continental breakfast and snacks. Room was nice with a lovely bathroom. Staff were friendly and service was good. Good selection at breakfast of both continental and hot Irish breakfast, plus loved the fresh honeycomb which was a lovely feature . We will be back.",5,2016,06,20
211,Excellent stay,"Stayed one night at the Croke Park on my way to a Scandinavian cruise. Arrived early morning, well before check in time. Staff was very accommodating, took care of my luggage and provided me access to the executive lounge even though I wasn't officially checked in. That enabled me to have a cup of tea and to enjoy the lovely continental breakfast before heading out for the day. That afternoon when I returned and checked in I found a comfortable, well appointed room with nice amenities. Dinner in the Sideline Bistro was very good and the service was pleasant and attentive. I will definitely stay here again the next time I am in Dublin.",5,2016,06,20
211,Rachel & Karen’s 2016 Tour of Southern Ireland.  20 years from our last tour!,"The Croke Park Hotel.  1 night stop.
Lovely hotel & welcome from the female receptionist, even though we were looking dishevelled in very wet motorcycle gear.  Hotel & Rooms spotless as expected of a hotel of this class.  Great underground parking then an easy 10 minute walk in to the top of O’Connell St, or short taxi ride.  
Directly opposite the Croke Park Stadium, so bear in mind if there is a match on, this could affect getting in or out.  Returning in the evening to the hotel, all male bar staff, not making us as welcome, even though it is a public hotel bar & we were paying cash, they were checking  what room we were in as if we weren’t guests. 
So all in all we would stay there again, but wouldn’t spend money in the bar in the evening, plenty of more welcoming places in the city.",5,2016,06,19
211,Great hotel,"Just stayed here 2 night for our trip to Dublin.  Lovely hotel .great facilities.gorgeous food. 
Rooms are lovely.  Would recommend staying here. 
Only negative was the hairdryer was overheating and switching off every 30 seconds!! Reception didn't seem concerned when I took it to them! 
This however wouldn't put us off staying here again; and hope to be back soon!!",5,2016,06,19
211,Comfort in Dublin!,"My husband and I stayed at the Croke Park for a week. It was our first trip to Dublin  and I can't speak highly enough of the hotel. It's a bit of a walk (10-15minutes) from the centre of Dublin, but we didn't mind the walk at all. It also meant the hotel was quieter than those in the centre city and we could see some of the local neighbourhood. The rooms were immaculate, service was outstanding.  Just the perfect place to come after a long day exploring historic Dublin. Would absolutely recommend and would return in a heartbeat!",5,2016,06,18
211,Clean & Modern,"Stayed here 2 nights, June 3&4.  This review basically just concurs with the good things others have written. The hotel is modern and very well maintained. The rooms are stylish and immaculate. The bed and pillows were, well, dreamy! Slept perfectly and heard virtually no hallway noise as the building is superbly sound-proofed.
Yes, the hotel is in a fairly drab part of town, directly across the street from Croke Park stadium (especially ideal if you're staying for an event). Don't be expecting some traditional little Irish hotel in a quaint part of town. 
Still, it was a very easy and short walk to the Temple Bar area and other downtown attractions. Also, I found a nice little market, open until 10 pm, less than a 5 minute walk from the hotel (turn right on street in front of hotel, turn right at next street, walk about a block and store will be on your right).
I did not eat at the hotel so can't comment on that. The Guiness was nice and cold though! 
I dare to say The Croke Park is the nicest hotel and best deal on anything even close to downtown Dublin!
",5,2016,06,17
211,Weekend in Dublin,"Spent 2 nights at The Crock Park during my stay in Dublin. 

Walking distance to the city center is 10 minutes. The hotel is nice and quiet. Rooms are of good quality and beds are very good. Free good quality Wifi included.

Friendly staff that supports you with directions - and umbrellas if needed.

Price level for the hotel is quite high, and you have to pay 15 Euro pr head for breakfast. I would recommend staying at the hotel - but enjoying the breakfast at one of the many breakfast places in the city center.",4,2016,06,17
211,Wonderful Restful Hotel Away from the Hustle Bustle,"We always stay here when we overnight in Dublin.  It is a convenient ten minute-drive from the Irish Ferries terminal.  It offers free garage parking to guests.  It is away from the hustle bustle of downtown Dublin (but it certainly would not be quiet if there is a sporting event or concert going on at Croke Park which is literally across the street - check ahead).  We get the executive level rooms which offer a very nice free continental breakfast in the morning in the executive lounge.  The restaurant and the bar both offer high quality dinner options, and the service is quite good.  Highl;y recommended.",4,2016,06,16
211,Nice Hotel with most friendly staff ,"We stayed for three nights in June first week 2016. 
Checked in late by midnight but surprised to see alertness and friendliness of staff on duty.  Very prompt checked in. Luggage was off loaded and shifted to our rooms.  Very large rooms with modern facilities.  Comfortable beds. Big bathroom with luxury fittings. Good quality towels , toiletries.  Lavish spread of tea coffee assortment in rooms.  Though tap water is safe to drink still we were given water bottles.  They have installed cold water cum ice dispenser on each floor for use.  Wifi was fast and works. Room service was prompt and efficient.  Housekeeping was great.  Check out was quick and hassle free.  Without asking we were again given water bottles while going to airport.  
Since we were two families with small kids all due care was taken by staff to make us comfortable.  One of the best place to stay during our trip of Europe.  
Much appreciated the courtesy and service with a smile extended by the staff. ",5,2016,06,16
211,Overnight for a one day business meeting in Dublin,The hotel was good and located directly next tothe stadium.  It took about half an hour to walk into the city centre - not an especially scenic route but not too threatening even late in teh evening.  The hotel was about a 10 minute walk from bus stops with regular direct services to the airport.  Staff were a little overly attentive - I was asked more than 6 times during dinner whether everthing was OK - this is too much when you are just wanting to eat your meal.,4,2016,06,16
211,"Out of the way, but a great place to stay!","We found this place on Trip Advisor.  In short, it was a perfect stay. From the moment we arrived, the staff treated us perfectly.  We had a warm welcome, and were given a very nice room. It was very clean, roomier than most modern hotel rooms, and had a comfortable bed.  The concierge was very helpful, as were the front desk staff in providing directions and recommendations.  The place is about a 15 minute walk to the edge of the main business area downtown, or a short bus ride from a bus stop about 5 minutes away.  The buses run frequently, and are not too expensive. The bus drivers are also very friendly and helpful.  I was surprised how quiet the room was, and I am a very light sleeper so this was really nice.  I have no complaints at all, and would stay there again without hesitation.  There is a big sports stadium across the street, and this can cause some issues if you are arriving or leaving during a match, but it really did not affect our stay at all.  Also, the WiFi is free and fast!",5,2016,06,14
211,Elite Hotel,"Croke Park Hotel provides a wonderful service for all its customers, whether it's for pleasure or business purposes. Top class facilities matched equally by top class employees whom are determined to provide the highest quality of service to all it's guests. ",5,2016,06,14
211,Breakkfast Should have been included,I was bummed when they told me I had to pay for breakfast. Other than that it was a nice and clean hotel to stay at. It was about a 15 minutes walk to go to the heart of Dublin. Would have been nice if some games were happening at the park.,4,2016,06,13
211,Amazing,"Best hotel I've ever been too!! Kindest staff ever!! I only stayed one night but I wished I stayed there my whole trip! Wonderful hotel, great food and service. Our room was awesome! Loved the fourth floor lounge! The staff was so kind! They delivered chocolates to the door just to see if we needed anything. Loved it.",5,2016,06,13
211,"Friendly, helpful staff","The staff was well trained, friendly, and caring. We had a great stay. No surprises- except the pleasant kind. Thank you for your  hospitality. A bit of a walk from the touristy areas of the city, but well worth it once you make it back.  Traveled with wife and adult daughter. All were delighted with the accommodations and kindness.",5,2016,06,10
211,Super Experience,"Extraordinary staff... very helpful, friendly, and caring.  We were on the executive floor..excellent room and outstanding continental breakfast ..(included smoked salmon, selection of cheeses, breads, yoghurt, fruits, coffee/espresso machine).One of the best hotel experience ever!
The location may not be ideal for some...concerts,games at the Croke Park across the street create noise. (Check venue dates.) Location is about 20 min. walk to the Post Office or about 30 min to Dublin Castle.  Taxi may be better for those walking alone at night.",5,2016,06,10
211,Great place for family stay,Great place to stay. UKarma was very helpful and went out of the way to help us out. I know where I will stay next time in Dublin. Close to city center and nice clean rooms. Recommend staying on fourth floor for added amenities. Definitely recommend for families!!!!,5,2016,06,10
211,"Helpful staff, clean hotel","Clean, modern hotel located fairly close to the airport.  A little north of the city, we walked to the city center but it was a bit of a trek (~30 minutes or so).  Not the greatest surrounding area if you aren't attending an event at Croke Park but it suited our purposes.  Free parking garage, average free wireless, good water pressure, clean beds.  If you plan on going out at night you might want something closer to the city center, otherwise you may need a cab.",4,2016,06,10
211,Must stay for events at Croke Park,"Stayed here because of its proximity to Croke Park Stadium and wasn't disappointed. Great hotel, friendly helpful staff, nice room, great food and comfy bar. 

Well equipped rooms - safe, mini bar, ice bucket, hairdryer, trouser press, The White Company toiletries, a good selection of refreshments.  We didn't work out how to open the mini bar as it seemed to be locked but aside from that, we had everything required. The ice dispenser in the corridors on each level were very welcome as we had wonderfully hot weather. 

Had lunch in the Italian along the road which was great too.",5,2016,06,09
211,wonderful experience,all you expect from a high quality hotel in terms of room quality and overall hotel feel. The staff were almost excessively helpful and happy. 24 hr desk was also a plus and just in general a great stay.,5,2016,06,09
211,Croke Park,Croke Park Hotel is a Fantastic Hotel and Staff are Very Friendly and Helpful location is ideal rooms are spotless and also comfortable.  I would recommend family and friends to stay at this location..,5,2016,06,09
211,Great Stay!,"Stayed here on the National Football League Final day and Lochra Gael.  It was very busy but check in was quick and the staff were very friendly and pleasant.  The room was great and had everything you would need.  Access to the executive lounge was a lovely luxury and the kids enjoyed the breakfast a lot because of the freshly made pancakes and hot chocolate they were offered.  The free parking is such a convenience in Dublin.  The food in the restaurant was wonderful, although we had to wait on our food, when it came it was faultless and the staff were very good.",5,2016,06,07
211,an easy walk to the center of town,"the staff was quite efficient and helpful.

breakfast had variety and was very good.

the problem with the room I had was that the self-locking doors were very noisy.
naturally I had a room next to a gregarious foursome who had relays in and out the door; I could almost decipher their conversations through the wall.",3,2016,06,06
211,Lovely Stay ,"Spent one night here and would definitely return here. The hotel was clean and tidy, my room was spacious and very clean. I ate dinner and breakfast and could not fault the food or the service. Staff were friendly and courteous I especially liked the free bottle of water on check out. A nice touch. ",5,2016,06,06
211,one of my favourites,"This is one of the best hotels I have stayed out.
Between the airport and the city centre, walking distance from Drumcondra train station.
Taxis are always available, the reception staff can help you booking one if need.
The entrance is not your typical hotel entrance; there is a nice , relaxing seating area where you can read newspapers
the staff is very welcoming and friendly. the breakfast restaurant is not too big but comfortable enough; the buffet has lot to offer for all taste.
The room was spacious, clean, comfortable, so was the bathroom with bath tub and shower. We didn't turn on the TV but it was a good size; we had wifi throughout the hotel, which was reliable.
I've stayed in many hotels in Dublin and this one is my favourite as well as my kids.",5,2016,06,05
211,nice hotel .... decent location within easy walk of city centre,good amenities at this hotel and not too far from city centre and temple bar district.  free on-site parking too.  room was nice and clean.  easy to find driving in to the city.  was a bit pricey but definitely get what you pay for.  would stay here again in dublin.,4,2016,06,05
211,Lovely stay,"Had a lovely stay, very accommodating, staff very friendly. Rooms good, although don't know what access is like on match days. Had great breakfast and lovely four day stay. Easy access in to Dublin city centre. A good Craic! Fully reccomend😊",5,2016,06,05
211,Nice but not close to the city center,"A very nice, comfortable hotel but not close to the city center. Plan to take a taxi for anything you want to do. Reasonable price with a full hot breakfast. Just disappointed that it was not close to any attractions, bars or restaurants. Cab ride will cost you 10 euros to go to the city center. ",4,2016,06,04
211,Marion's experience,"I will say that the Croke Park Hotel is the  most friendly, clean, welcoming hotel in Ireland in my opinion.  
Sean is just wonderful and nothing is too much bother for him.
The price is very reasonable and the location excellent particularly if you are a GAA Fan.
I would recommend to anyone and for me it's like a second home when I visit Dublin",5,2016,06,04
211,The Croke Park was wonderful,"The Croke Park was perfect for us.  The hotel was in a nice location and has underground parking and it is only a 10 minute walk to Dublin.  We upped to the executive package, it was worth every dime!  We had a delicious dinner with an outstanding dessert.  Staff was wonderful, I lost a green jacket in the hotel or parking lot and they could not have been nicer trying to help me find it!  Rooms were clean, we had access to the executive lounge, full breakfast was included and delicious, late checkout, drinks on both nights.  We were celebrating my birthday and the manager left us two small bottles of sparkling wine.  Room was clean, bed was comfortable.  Overall a great experience.",5,2016,06,02
211,What all hotels should aspire to!,"We just stayed at the Croke Park for the second time.  Each time we've stayed there has been brilliant.  The staff couldn't be more friendly and professional.  The rooms are spotless, comfortable and roomy.  The food is great, especially if you love buffet breakfasts like our family!  Even though the hotel was packed out for the Bruce Springsteen concert, the staff was still able to handle the crowds with ease and make each person staying there feel valued and important. It's also great value compared to other hotels in Dublin. If we have our way, we'll definitely be back soon!",5,2016,06,02
211,Great base to explore Dublin,"We visited Dublin for a few days after a wedding in Ireland. Check in was quick and easy, the concierge service was extremely helpful in explaining how to get around the city. We used the restaurant one night which served good food and the waitress was very friendly and kind to give us her own tips on what to see on our visit! Location of the hotel is great to see the main sights, about a 15 minute walk into the centre of the city so we did not pay for transport for the whole stay. The rooms itself was clean, quiet and bed extremely comfortable. We would definitely return here in the future if we are ever back in Dublin!",5,2016,05,30
211,Fab hotel!,"We stayed here as we were attending a concert at Croke Park and this hotel is literally across the road (it's even more convenient if your seat is in the Hogan stand). 
The hotel was super busy due to the concert however the service from the staff was superb. They even threw in complimentary breakfast! 
The room was spotless and spacious.
We ordered room service which was really quick and the food was of a good standard.
Breakfast was excellent with plenty of choice - self service with the waiters bringing tea/ coffee and toast.
We thoroughly enjoyed our stay and only wish we had booked an extra night!",5,2016,05,29
211,Very accomodating and convenient,"Croke Park is very close to the airport and a very luxurious hotel.  I had a late check-in, and there was a bunch of people downstairs still winding down from the game at the stadium.  It was fun, and it was nice that I didn't hear any of this from my room just one floor up.

The parking garage is amazing- spacious and perfect for tourists trying to adjust to driving on the other side of the road.

I only had one night there, but the staff was extremely friendly and accomodating.",5,2016,05,29
211,Perfect location,"Warm greeting with refreshing hot towels on arrival, knowledgeable staff, quick check in even though early. Tasty hot breakfast with efficient staff. Beds v comfortable, had great nights sleep! Well organised even with concert on and large volume of people around. ",5,2016,05,29
211,Springsteen concert,"My husband,son and I stayed at the croke park because it's right beside croke park stadium .The hotel was very busy when we arrived  because of the Bruce Springsteen concert but the check in staff and the concierge were all great .Our room was lovely and very clean .The buffet style breakfast was lovely with lots to choose from .overall we had a great time ,and Springsteen rocked 😊",5,2016,05,29
211,Perfect location for Croke Park concert,"We stayed here for the Bruce Springsteen concert. Great hotel beside the venue. The venue is obviously used to dealing with large crowds and the comfortable rooms are well soundproofed. Good breakfast and pleasant, accommodating staff made this an enjoyable stay. There were no rooms available available for the Friday night but miraculously became available when Thursday night was also booked. Expensive but given its easy access to the stadium it was probably worth it.",4,2016,05,28
211,Lovely hotel with excellent staff. ,"Myself and my partner visited The Croke Park for a long weekend. When we arrived at Dublin Airport, we decided on getting the Aircoach to the hotel. This was straight forward and the hotel was literally a 10minute walked from the bus stop. 

I had emailed the hotel in advance and requested a room at the rear of the hotel as previous posts suggested - the room was lovely and very quiet, the only issue were other guests being noisy whilst walking along the corridor, but this can't be helped. 

We stayed in a superior room with breakfast - the breakfast was very good, with lots of choice available. The breakfast room staff were also polite and cheerful, which made it a pleasure to see them. 

We stayed for a total of 4 days at The Croke Park and walked to and from the city centre at various times of day/night. I would agree with certain posts about the area being a little run down around the hotel, but we didn't have any problems at all. It is about a 20 - 25 minute walk though. 

Overall I would happily stay at The Croke Park again and would like to thank all the staff, as it was a pleasure and made our stay more enjoyable. ",5,2016,05,28
211,Outstanding service,"I arrived at 8.30pm with no reservation and no rooms available in Dublin. As a previous guest, the Front deskl first looked for an alternative Hotel and ultimately found me a room on site, and added on free dinner as I was on the ground floor.",5,2016,05,27
211,The Wheel Conference 2016,Stayed at The Croke Park Hotel for the conference. The hotel was exceptional and exceeded all my expectations from start to finish. The complimentary bottle of water on departure was a lovely touch. Would highly recommend the hotel and look forward to returning.,5,2016,05,27
211,Great hotel -- but not location,"This hotel was lovely.  Modern, clean, and comfortable.  The staff was the friendliest we came across in our week long trip.   The bar and restaurant were lovely - which was great, since there wasn't much else nearby.  Good hotel for our early flight the next day.",4,2016,05,26
211,Comfortable Hote,We stayed and visited the stadium across the road. We visited some sites around the city but had to get a taxi to most of them. The breakfast was nice - self service - and the staff were friendly. The key card in the lift gave some trouble but overall the hotel was comfortable.,4,2016,05,26
211,Great location for a conference,"I stayed here on a conference over at he stadium which is across the road from the hotel. It's not in the best location as a result but if you were like me needing to be close to the stadium then it's the best choice. Bedrooms were compact but fairly modern and quiet. Good sized bathroom with separate bath and double shower.  TVs in the bedroom were a little old fashioned - original small silver finished flatscreens which looked a little out of place in the rooms and in the gym to be honest. 

Breakfast was a good selection and the bar area nice. Gym only had 2 running machines and so that wasn't ideal. 

To get to town it was a €15-20 taxi ride. 

A good option for the conference otherwise if you are planning to visit the city of Dublin is go elsewhere. 
",4,2016,05,25
211,Great hotel but solid ten minute walk to anything,"Our room was great - nice and spacious with a lovely bathroom. The including parking was definitely nice as parking in Dublin can be a nightmare. If you have plans to attend a sporting event at Croke Park this is perfect - directly across the street!! And even though there were two events going on the first evening we were in town we didn't hear a single sound from our room which we found impressive. The only downfall is that it is at least a ten minute walk to the edge of anything touristy you might want to see. We are young and in shape but by the time we got to where ever we were headed we were already wind blown, wet and tired. No complaints other than that though!",4,2016,05,24
211,Croke Park is grand,"We stayed in the Croke Park Hotel three nights, which entitled us to free breakfasts. (It's a shame that breakfasts aren't always inclusive in hotel stays these days.) As a re-entry to Dublin (first time for my wife) it was grand, being so well situated and only fifteen minutes drive from Dublin Port, where our ferry from Holyhead docked. What's more, thankfully there was no match or event being held in Croke Park itself over the weekend we were there.
Service was excellent, the staff friendly, and the hotel was a place to be at ease, now that we are in our sixth decade of life. It is so near the centre that we could walk there in 20 minutes or so, the first time in the rain. And it is close enough that breaking up the day with a rest in our hotel room between times was easily done.
We left behind a charger, but a call to the hotel and it was in an envelope and on its way to our home address, where it awaited us on our return from Ireland. Great service and what a hotel is all about. We'll be back!",4,2016,05,24
211,"Nice hotel, good service","We stayed here for just one night while on our way home from other destinations.

It is a nice hotel, service was very good.
We didn't walk to town, but they said it was about 20 minutes away.

If you don't mind being out a little ways from the main part of town it is a good hotel.",4,2016,05,23
211,Enjoyable stay in a great spot.,"For my partner's birthday, we flew out for a weekend in Dublin. I wanted to choose a hotel that felt cozy, yet elegant, and from the photos, this fit the bill. Staff were helpful in sorting out a card problem before arrival, and upon check-in, I was impressed at their help and knowledge. Took a moment to get the hang of elevators, but the added security on a match day over our stay was reassuring.

As we stayed on the executive floor, there was a free lounge with coffee, tea, bottled water and fruit juice, and fruit available, plus continental breakfast in the morning. The continental breakfast selection was light compared to some I've had, and as I can't eat dairy, my selection was even more limited, but for a morning snack it was fine.

The location was fine for us. I was worried it would feel rough based on other reviews, but we were comfortable walking to the city bus stops near Drumcondra in daylight and evening, and to the O'Connell St DART station in the day. We're also used to walking a lot through various neighbourhoods, so your mileage may vary, however. With a three-day Visitor LEAP Card each, we were set for exploring.

Great experience, will likely return.",5,2016,05,23
211,Great service!,Loved the stay here...wasn't looking to spend a ton of money on a place to stay in Ireland and found the Croke. Staff is super friendly and sandwiches for late night jet lag outings with my 5 year old was nice. Location isn't in the middle of town but not more than a 10-20 minute drive from sites. ,4,2016,05,21
211,Croke Park Hotel,"Really good hotel situated a little way from the centre of Dublin, but very convenient for the ferry. Lovely room and excellent shower. Good lighting in spacious room, and very fairly priced meal in the restaurant. Underground secure parking, free if you are staying at the hotel.
We couldn't stay for breakfast as catching the early boat but were given bottles of water to see us on our way.",5,2016,05,21
211,Relaxed and Elegant,"The room was lovely with a sleek decor and comfortable atmosphere. We were there only one night, but we much enjoyed our accommodations and the gym. Free parking was an important perk to choosing this hotel.",5,2016,05,21
211,Very Comfortable  Hotel,"I was in Dublin for a business conference.  The meetings were across the street from the hotel in the Croke Park stadium which was very convenient.  We had a room on the fourth floor with access to the lounge.  The lounge access was very nice with water, juices and coffee availalbe 24-7.  There was a continental breakfast available in the mornings and it was never crowded.  The room was next to the elevator but we never heard any noise.  The room was large and comfortable and had a very good work space.  Checkin was easy and the staff was friendly and helpful.  We made the reservation by exchanging emails and all was in order.  I was in the room one evening as they came to do the turn down service.  They were very attentive to details and wanted to insure that all was right.  The person doing the service was very polite and wanted to insure that the room was in good order for us.  There was no place to plug in a hair dryer in the bathroom so we used a mirror and plug in the room.  There was a pants presser in the room which was a nice feature given a long trip and business meetings so I was pleased to be able to use it.  This was not in the part of town I would have ordinarily have picked out but obvioulsy very convenient to the stadium and excellent location for our meetings. WiFi was very fast especially by American standards in other words it was 10 times faster that what I have to pay for at home.  I would recommend the hotel.",4,2016,05,21
211,Nice hotel.,"The Croke Park is a nice hotel which, if you do want 4-star service/stay, but do not want overpay for location, is a nice alternative for the citycentre location hotels in Dublin.
Breakfast is good, they have a shuttle service to the hop on/off bus service.

Would do it again? YES!",4,2016,05,20
211,Comfortable Digs,We just stayed one night. The hotel was comfortable and quiet. The room was large with a balcony and king size bed. Quality hotel with excellent front desk staff. No hesitation in recommending this hotel. Enjoy!,4,2016,05,19
211,Good for Business ... and also for holidays,"Very good choice for a Hotel. Almost everything well done. I definitely will suggest the hotel for a Business trip in Dublin. I think if i'll be in Dublin again will try something more ""familiar"" as a B&B. Anyway good choice. Suggested.",4,2016,05,19
211,My stay at the Croke Park Hotel,"The hotel itself is up to date in terms of 4 star ratings. The staff were exceptional. The food was delicious. My room was very clean and very comfortable. I would recommend anyone on any type of holiday, family or otherwise to stay here.",5,2016,05,19
211,Quality hotel with 5 star service,"Having been staying at this Hotel regularly for the past 3 years , I really look forward to coming back . The staff in all area's are excellent and the bar food is very good.
Rooms are spotless and comfortable with a good WiFi signal . The only minor issue was the poached eggs I ordered for breakfast - they were like bullets , very hard , but to be fair they are normally fine - real surprise is that the chef served them.",5,2016,05,19
211,"Excellent Hotel, I will be returning!","I stayed in the Croke Park Hotel recently (Friday the 13th) but this stay wasn't a horror story!!!  From the moment we entered the hotel, we were pleasantly surprised.  Phillip on the reception desk was so welcoming, a true professional.  Any questions we asked were answered with such courtesy.  The room was beautifully decorated and I genuinely couldn't fault this hotel at all.  As we were leaving early next morning, we were given a takeaway breakfast which was greatly appreciated. I look forward to staying in this hotel in the future. ",5,2016,05,18
211,Hotel that left a pleasant glow!,"We stayed for two nights in the Croke Park Hotel as it was a good location for attendance at a wedding nearby.  We found the staff, without exception, to be friendly, helpful, professional.  We had an executive room - spacious, comfortable, very quiet.  All the little extras that help to make for an enjoyable stay - mini bar, bottled water, safe, newspaper, nice toiletries, chocolates, complimentary wine/beer vouchers...

We had dinner in the Bistro which was most enjoyable and served by charming waitresses.  A varied menu, perfectly cooked, a good wine list.  Breakfast was fine - self-service for the most part...plenty of fresh breads, fruit, cereals including porridge, cold meats and the usual cooked eggs, bacon etc.

Other reviewers have mentioned the concierge and I agree - he was very helpful and knowledgeable.

An enjoyable stay.  I have no hesitation in recommending the Croke Park Hotel.  (O.K. it's a bit out of the city centre - but there's free parking and it's handy to several sites on the north side).",5,2016,05,18
211,Great Value for Money,"We travelled as a family with a baby during the Easter Holiday.

We booked the family room on the executive floor which is the only one on that floor. The room is a good size with everything you need and you have access to the lounge which is quiet with drinks and fruits. Complimentary beer or wine is provided through a voucher which is a nice touch. Travel cot is provided without any charge. With the pram, car seat and two bags, there is not much room left though. 

Location: not in downtown area but is within walkable distance (half an hour or so) to the major tourist attractions. It is in the north of the city which is closer compared to downtown hotels to the airport and is less than half hour ride from the airport. The tourist bus has a pick up service which is helpful and the concierge has the time table. However, as we were there during the Easter Holiday weekend, there was some confusion about the schedule at the hotel which was disappointing. It is right across the football station which makes it a very busy and happy (I guess it would depend on the result) hotel during football match days. Be aware there could be traffic control around during football matches and a very busy front desk. The vibe completely changes from a quiet business travel hotel to a very busy family / friend hotel. Surrounding area is safe but not pretty. Delivero does not cover the hotel which is a shame. 

Food: good in room service and breakfast on the ground floor. Very worthwhile.

Service: friendly staff with quite good service.

In summary, it is good value for money considering the room size, facility, service and food. I called all the top 10 hotels for a room with three adults and an infant and decided to go with this given the facility, size and price. Location wise it depends on the weather and whether you are up to a walk or taxi ride to all the attractions. Taxis are very available during our stay. ",4,2016,05,17
211,Excellent hotel in Dublin,"Near the famous Croke Park stadium, a hotel with plente of facilities and superb attention!
The delegates at the reception made everything for me to stay well after a late arrival at the hotel. A hotel to be considered on visiting Dublin for business!",5,2016,05,17
211,Great staff and Lovely Room,"The check-in was seamless.  The room wasn't ready when we arrived early, but they took our bags, and we went out to lunch.  When we came back the room was ready and I was blown away by the size of the room and how clean and nice it was.  I only wish we had stayed longer so I could have taken the tour of Croke Park across the street.",5,2016,05,17
211,Short stop,Stayed here for a night while our son was having an operation in Temple Street. The rooms are spacious and clean although a small bit warm. Food choice for children is limited in the bar but the adults menu was very tasteful. Breakfast is great with plenty of choice and parking is ideal. Love the touch with the complimentary water on check out. Would definitely recommend this hotel,4,2016,05,17
211,"Comfortable, clean and well located","Modern, clean and comfortable hotel.  Great public areas, bar and restaurant.  Rooms excellent.  Parking on site very convenient and friendly staff.  Located very well for stadium and 30 minute walk/ 10 minute taxi to shops......Would definitely return.",4,2016,05,17
211,Nice Hotel with Excellent Concierge,"This is a nice and clean hotel if a little outside of DT Dublin.  HOWEVER, Krishna the Concierge made our stay worth staying a few extra days.  He guided us to the best tours, things to see and the best ""non-touristy"" places to eat and we were not disappointed in any of his recommendations.  Upon arriving, it is worth staying in this hotel a few days to capitalize on Krishna's knowledge and expertise, then move down to the Westin and you can walk everywhere.",4,2016,05,17
211,Reasonable price and great staff,"A 15 minute walk into the city centre, super helpful staff, very clean and big rooms. About a 20 Euro cab ride from the airport. 

We booked the room when there was an offer on so it was HUGELY good value for money.",5,2016,05,16
211,first class,The staff were fantastic and so efficient and made my stay trouble free very child friendly hotel. From check in to our check out I found the staff friendly and nothing was any trouble I couldn't recommend anyplace better in dublin,5,2016,05,16
211,Good stopover,"I was only in the hotel for about 10 hours as it was a stopover with a late night arrival and 9:00 checkout.  Nevertheless, I enjoyed my stay there and would seriously consider the hotel for a longer stay.

Check-in was fast and efficient, the helpful receptionist pointing out that if I booked breakfast (not included in my room rate) then rather than in the morning, I'd save a few Euros.

Finding the room was easy, the room itself was of a typical modern hotel pattern, clean and efficient and quite spacious.  The bed was comfortable and I had a good night's sleep.

Breakfast was surprisingly good - I'm usually wary of buffets, at least as far as the hot food is concerned, because it often isn't actually hot! However here, everything was fresh, hot and good quality. There was also a good selection of cereals, fruit, breads and so on. The coffee was also good quality.

Overall, then, a good stay if rather brief and I'd happily use the hotel for leisure as well as for business.",5,2016,05,16
211,Amazing ,"Stayed there an a number of occasions and always on the fourth floor, love the rooms and the hotel in general. Will most definitely stay again as they always meet our expectations on arrival and throughout our stay there. They also sometimes give coupons for drinks in the bar, which is a nice bonus ",5,2016,05,15
211,Lovely stay!,"All the staff were very friendly, nothing was a problem. The rooms were spotless and comfortable. Selection of food at breakfast was great and atmosphere in bar was lively. The gym facilities were fantastic. All round great stay and would recommend!",5,2016,05,14
211,Perfect stay in a great location for Croke Park,"This hotel is really clean, relaxed and peaceful. Car parking was plentiful and the location to the stadium is perfect.
The breakfast was very nice and and the staff could not be more helpful, the free bottles of water upon check out was a very nice touch.

The price is a little on the high side but the service and facilities offered are excellent.",5,2016,05,13
211,Ehh ,"Fairly standard but clean hotel. Around a 30 minute walk to the city center. Television selection is decent, but not great. Concierge allowed us to store our bags before checking in later that day (and offered us warm towels). All in all,  a reasonably nice hotel, but overpriced for what it is. ",3,2016,05,11
211,no complaints!,"Hotel was great, about a 15 min walk to city center. Rooms were very modern, spacious and clean. Breakfast was very good as well and helped you start off your day. I would stay at this hotel again and recommend it to others.",5,2016,05,11
211,"Excellent, Great Service","Myself and 2 friends stayed here over the Easter Holidays, it was a fantastic hotel.
It isn't centrally located, but with taxi's we made our way in and out of the city centre.
Staff could not have been more friendly and as it was one of the girl's birthdays there was prosecco left up to the room for us.
Staff allowed us to check in early and were very helpful suggesting sights and where we should go for a drink in town.
Would be back again without a doubt!",5,2016,05,10
211,FANTASTIC HOTEL,"This was our second visit to The Croke Park, from start to finish everything and I mean everything is top class. The service is exceptional from the reception staff, to the bar staff to the chamber maids. Whoever recruited and trained the staff deserves a medal they are a credit to the hotel. We have stayed at many hotels across the globe with 5 star ratings and I can honestly say this one tops our list !!. ",5,2016,05,10
211,Lovely Hotel,"My husband and I stayed here for one night.  The hotel itself is very good.  The reception is bright and airy and the staff are friendly and welcoming.  Check in was quick and easy.  We sayed in room 212.  It had a double and single bed , was spotlessly clean and had all the ammenities you expect.  No view at all but we were not in the room too long.  The only down side to this hotel is the area it is in.  We decided to walk into the centre of Dublin and I did not feel at all comfortable the area is like a housing estate with groups of young men hanging about on every corner.  I realise this is not the hotels fault but it is unfortunate that such a lovely hotel is lessened by the area it is in.  The upshot is that unless you are attending an event in Croke Park itself, for which the hotel is perfect, I would look elsewhere.",4,2016,05,10
211,excellent,I stayed in the hotel for two nights as i was  getting laser on my eye in the mater hospital.It was very easy to get a taxi to and from the hospital.The staff were very understanding. Because i could nt go down to the dinning room to eat i ordered room service.and the food was love .The morning i was leaving i had to wait on a lift to collect me as i couldnt really see . but they were running late so i rang down to the desk They were really nice and  said i could stay in the room till my friend turned up.That was nice .,5,2016,05,09
211,"Nice stay, but the location was tough","This hotel, though modern, clean and friendly, is not centrally located and the surrounding area can be a little sketchy, but overall, it's ok.  Free underground parking was a great help!  The staff was friendly and welcoming and a special shout out to the young concierge who gave us a great place to have dinner when we got there.  The rooms were large and comfortable, but strangely, the beds were on wheels.  I'm sure this is to make the housekeepers job easier, but one wrong move and your pillow is on the floor between the bed and the wall.  We traveled with three in our party, but sadly, there were only ever services for two coffee drinkers. On our last night we had to get towels for our third traveler.  We could not regulate the air in our room, which was very stuffy, so we had to open a window. The traditional Irish Breakfast was delicious and a great way to start your day before heading out to tour the town.  Comfy beds, very clean floors.",4,2016,05,09
211,Great stay in a great hotel ,"Stayed here for one night while attending a concert nearby, we have booked 2 rooms with 2 double beds in each, rooms were very spacious and spotlessly clean. The bathrooms a great size with separate bath and shower. Good toiletries were also left as well as a good selection of tea, coffee and hot chocolate. The bar in the hotel is also one of the best bars I have seen for a hotel , great service and free snacks when you order a drink. The underground parking is also free when staying at the hotel. Overall I really cannot fault this hotel, didn't eat breakfast so cannot comment on that aspect , already looking forward to returning in the future. ",5,2016,05,08
211,"Beautiful, but . . . .","Situated directly across the street from the 85,000 seat Crime Park Gaelic Football stadium, this hotel is modern and beautiful. Super clean and spacious. Very pleasant staff. 
Not much to speak of outside. A pub that never did open, and a kebab take-away that didn't open until 1 p.m. 
O'Connell Street, and lots of shopping, is about a 15- minute walk away. Temple Bar, Grafton Street and Trinity College are a good bit further. Make sure you get back to the hotel during daylight hours, or take a cab back. 
Super hotel in a crummy area. Perfect if you plan to spend your stay in your room, but who goes to Ireland to sit in a room ?!?
Photos of area near hotel below.
Wouldn't stay here on my own time, only due to the location. Otherwise, quite nice! ",4,2016,05,05
211,Its ok,"We spent four nights there , rooms are good, but they never replenished the frigobar which was empty since we arrived, even though we requested it several times ! . Other than that, people are really very nice, gym is spacious and the bar it's good too for a hotel. Problem is that the hotel it's a bit far away from city center, not in the best neighborhood of Dublin.

I believe the south bank, is probably a better place to stay, towards St Stephens Green.",4,2016,05,04
211,Another excellent stay,"Once again, another excellent stay at The Croke Park. The friendliness of the staff, the excellent food and service, and the comfort and cleanliness of the hotel are real delights and made our stay a very memorable one. Can't wait to make a return visit.",5,2016,05,03
211,A wonderful hotel,"I've stayed here many times for a work trip. Clean spacious rooms and bathrooms. Staff is very helpful and extremely nice. A little walk to central Dublin, 
but not to far. It's across the street from Croke park in which they do have games and concerts at. 
Great Irish breakfast in the morning. ",5,2016,05,03
211,Pleasant weekend stay,"All the staff at the Croke Park are very welcoming,friendly and helpful. We chose to stay in an executive room which included complimentary continental breakfast. Although the choice was a little limited (no cooked breakfast) there was nevertheless enough to satisfy most people and plenty of smoked salmon, ham and salami which was regularly topped up. The accommodation was good and the linen very clean. A short walk into the city centre was easy and a chance to stretch your legs.",4,2016,05,03
211,Best hotel ever,Most comfortable hotel ever!great staff on arrival kids where given a princess pack and pirate pack containing lots of things to keep them entertained.offered a story time service for kids also. Food was amazing this hotel was expensive but u get what u pay for in this case.great hotel !! 5 star in my book ,5,2016,05,02
211,Nice hotel,"My partner and I have just returned from our trip to Dublin. I booked this hotel after reading the reviews here on tripadvisor, some of the reviews say it is only 15 mins walk into the centre, however it is more like 25-30 mins if you want to get to O'Connell Street - if you want to go to the south side (St Stephens Green, Temple Bar) we decided to get a taxi there at night times(€8-10) as it's quite a walk. However, in saying that - if you get the Dublin Hop on and Off bus pass there is a shuttle bus from the hotel regularly in the morning and a return bus at 4pm or you can get off on stop 24 and it's only a 10 min walk back. 

With regards to the hotel, it's lovely, very good value for money and the customer service is great. I had advised the hotel that it was my partners 30th birthday and the hotel provided complimentary prosecco and a birthday card which was a lovely touch. The iron in our room wasn't working, however after a quick call to reception this was easily rectified. The rooms are a good size and are cleaned daily. The only negative I have with our room was the bathroom. The fitting on the shower wasn't easily moved and was a bit dodgy (if you are tall like we are it was difficult to move and reposition and was held in place with a piece of plastic).  

We didn't eat at the hotel but the bar area was lovely. 

The concierge was very helpful and helped us out with directions and the bus tickets. 

All in all a nice hotel, excellent customer service, good value for money and if you don't mind a walk then I would recommend! ",4,2016,05,02
211,Perfect weekend away,"This hotel was amazing and provided a perfect weekend for me and my husband. Staff can't do enough for you. The staff go above and beyond to make your stay as welcoming as possible. 
The breakfast is definetly highly recommended and sets you up for the day. We did a lot of walking and didn't mind the 10 minute walk to the centre. Or you can get a taxi for around 10 euro. Croke park stadium is on the hotels doorstep and is worth a look round. Football wasn't my think but I have to say I found it very interesting. 
Would 100% recommend this hotel. And will definetly be staying again in the future. 
While there we purchased the Dublin pass which is well worth it if your planning on sightseeing. Saves you loads of money. 
The busses are really frequent and won't cost you more than €2.70 to get around the sights. 
A bus back to the airport is €6 and are very frequent. 
",5,2016,05,02
211,Lovely hotel ,Great hotel to stay at and in a good location as its close enough to the city centre. Cabs were around 10€ to the centre and you could easily walk it in about 15/20minutes. The staff were all very friendly. The rooms was nice and comfortable. Would definitely stay here again. ,5,2016,05,02
211,Lovely Place to Stay,"The hotel is lovely with very, very helpful staff, who would be able to assist with anything. Restaurant has delicious food that will fill you to the brim! Rooms very spacious and exceptionally clean, however it's a good 30 minute walk into the centre.",5,2016,05,01
211,Zeer verzorgd hotel...,"Stayed one night, even though the neighbourhood not the most beautiful I must say I was happy with the choice. Hotel and hotel rooms are very clean, comfortable beds, big bathroom with shower and separate bathtub.  Very friendly and helpful hotel staff.
We chose to stay here for our one day stopover on the to USA and will be our choice place for the next time.",5,2016,05,01
211,Superb front desk Welcome!,"We booked this hotel for a Sunday night stay in Dublin and so enjoyed the welcome and indeed the surprise upgrade to the Liam McCarthy suite.

This hotel really pushes out the hospitality welcome from the car-park attendant through to the front desk staff who all made our stay just Fabulous. We have stayed in many hotels but the Croke park experience and Value has to be congratulated, Well done to all for a great stay and hope to visit again soon.",5,2016,05,01
211,The Croke Park Hotel,"Fantastic Hotel - very high standards! Would go back there again!! Superb! The Hotel had everything you wanted. Staff were very helpful! The food was very good, and all four of us had a really good time.",5,2016,05,01
211,Great Hotel!!,This hotel was such a pleasant surprise! the room was perfect and the staff were so helpful and nice. The room was large and well equipped.  The car parking was free and secure.  It was a real pleasure to stay in this hotel.  I will stay here again and look forward to the experience.,5,2016,04,30
211,Wonderful hotel ,This was our 3rd time staying at the Croke Park hotel and once again it cannot be faulted. Check in as always is very quick (even if my booking had been placed in the cancellation folder by mistake) and the receptionists always have a smile. The rooms are spotless clean and of a very high standard. The short walk to O'Connell Street means that you are close enough to the centre of Dublin. The free car parking is another excellent feature about staying here. A car park with no charge is a rare thing in a capital city these days. Breakfast is always first class and reasonably priced too. I will definitely continue to stay here whenever I visit Dublin. ,5,2016,04,30
211,Great Rooms,We had stayed in another luxury hotel in France on the same trip that was not as nice as the Croke Park Hotel. Big rooms and large clean baths. We would stay here again. Next to Croke Park Stadium with convenient bus and taxi service.,5,2016,04,29
211,Wisest choice...,"As always another great weekend in Dublin at The Croke Park Hotel.  Wonderful staff who recognise a regular and are always friendly and helpful.  Food was delicious for dinner Saturday and Sunday evenings and my four children were delighted with everything including the ""Special Hot Chocolate""  Would highly recommend this hotel, the walk into town is short and full of historical buildings and parks so plenty to see from the door of the hotel to the busy bustling shopping streets.  As a Down fan, there's no place like Croke Park when the Dubs are putting on a show.",5,2016,04,28
211,Great stay. Could have stayed longer!,"Excellent service, friendly staff and lovely rooms. Nothing was a problem. Staff gave some insider tips on where to go for an evening outside tourist areas which was great. Clean bedding, clean room and the beds were comfortable. ",5,2016,04,28
211,Good place to stay,Stayed here with my wife and 2 kids on the night of the GAA football league finals and Laochra show in Croke Park which we attended. The family room we stayed in was lovely and quite spacious. We ate in the sideline bistro and the food was first class. Breakfast the next morning was excellent too. Car parking was free which was a nice wee bonus as well. Staff in general were very friendly and helpful apart from the bar staff as they didn't seem to be able to cope too well with the large crowd that was down for the finals. In fact one of the bar men was quite rude and aggressive when he messed up a drinks order. This was the only negative part of our stay and only for that I would give 5/5. Despite this I would definitely stay here again.,4,2016,04,27
211,Poor service from the front desk,"Booked a queens sized bed of the Internet about two hours before we were due to book in. Got to the room, two double beds and a single bed! Called reception, after a long time on hold for them to come up an excuse, I was told that that they switched me to this room because the hotel is pretty booked out tonight.... So I questioned why I paid and got to book the room on line two hours prior! Some terrible lame excuse  about they only had a ""facilities"" room left with a queen bed, that would not have a good shower etc...I really didn't understand ... He also tried to tell me that a queen Bed would only be marginally bigger than a double!! Second time here...with terrible front desk service... How dare he change our booking without telling and informing us at the front desk!! Bad start to our honeymoon ... No apology or any refund given to us...double beds I'm sure are cheaper than queen sized beds!!! ",2,2016,04,26
211,GOOD FOR BUSINESS THE CROKE PARK,"High quality hotel in excellent position for conducting business in the north side of the city, with readily available taxi etc service and very helpful staff (and within walking distance of city centre). Will be back",5,2016,04,26
211,Not the most attractive building........ but neither is Croke Park,"This is a Doyle hotel and as such, once you get over the less than attractive exterior, the hotel exudes quality.  It's a delight to find such a quality establishment in what is a not-so-nice part of town.  From attentive and professional staff to very well appointed rooms this hotel provides a refuge from the world outside; food is rather good too!",5,2016,04,26
211,Excellent comfortable hotel!,Two of us stayed here on a stag visit to Dublin! We wanted to stay somewhere a bit smarter than the rest of the group. The hotel is just 20mins from the airport and 30mins walk to the main hub in town! It sits adjacent to the croke park stadium which is excellent if there's a game on! Ask at concierge for tickets. The rooms are spacious and very comfortable. The buffet breakfast is lovely and has a lovely array of things to choose from. There is also the city sightseeing bus tour bus stop right next to the hotel entrance ... Good to get into town! A bit out of the hub but a bit different! Definitely use again.,4,2016,04,26
211,Fantastic!!,"Lovely hotel , great staff , really comfy beds !!  There were 8 in our party and we had a blast !! 20 mins walk into Dublin Centre , Temple Bar etc ... Great location and very accessible, the hotel bar and restaurant are fab and the staff are really friendly 😊",5,2016,04,25
211,Weekend break ,"The hotel is superb! The service at the front desk was great and always willing to help with any questions.
Located about a 20 minute walk from town meant after breakfast you could have a leisurely walk into the centre.
Great bar showing sport and the food at the restaurant was of very good quality.
Good fitness centre also.
5 stars

211,Nice hotel with friendly and helpful staff,"The staff were very helpful and friendly and the hotel was very clean. The rooms were very nicely decorated and were extremely quiet. The hotels location was quiet and not too far from the nightlife, which was only about 20 minutes walk from there.

I enjoyed my stay there i would definitely return again if I go to Dublin again.",5,2016,04,24
211,Wonderful little hotel,"Nice big rooms, great staff, relaxed atmosphere!
Next door to the huge Hurling stadium where 82,500 people gather to watch this sport!
Nice bar, great breakfast and free WiFi.
not too much in the neighborhood.",5,2016,04,24
211,Nice,"Helpfull personel, comfortable rooms. 

Good breakfast.

Next to the Croke Part stadium. I came to hotel for business event and stayed at 2 days, i'll choose again if i come to Dublin again. 

You should see The Croke PArk stadium also. 
",5,2016,04,24
211,Very nice staff & I will return,"From the moment I walked into the hotel, the staff were very nice. They were very helpful. The man who checked us in was very nice and even have a small conversation with us. Made us feel welcomed! 
The room was very nice and safe. When I was walking through the hotel all the staff that I walked by would smile and say hello which was very nice. I stayed at many hotel before and I'm going to say this one of the best hotels, I stayed in. 
Thanks for everything and I will return to stay with you. 
Just want to say to the manager on the hotel, you have trained your staff n very well.

See you again.",5,2016,04,23
211,Great stay!,"I stayed at this hotel for one night, solo traveler passing through Dublin. The price was affordable, the hotel was really great, modern decor, wonderful/brand new amenities, comfortable bed, and delicious breakfast which was included in with my room. The staff was very friendly. It was a little bit removed from the center of Dublin, but relatively easy to get to the more touristy attractions, whether by bus or walking. Close to great restaurants in china town, also really close to an aircoach stop and regular city bus to get to the airport, which was convenient for me. It's across the street from the stadium, so if there's an event there I'd imagine the area would get a bit busier. Overall I enjoyed my stay.",5,2016,04,22
211,Great hotel,"My family and I stayed here, we rented two rooms. When I was making the reservation I was asked if I had any requirements and I had asked for both rooms to be near each other. To my satisfied my requirement was meant. We arrived early than expected and the receptionist was very thoughtful and allowed us check in early, this was very much appreciated! We had complimentary parking even after we had checked out. Very modern hotel, clean and we all had a very enjoyable stay",5,2016,04,22
211,"close to the airport, friendly staff","end o a great week in Ireland, needed a place close to the Airport in Dublin. The room was very clean and the free breakfast on the executive suite was fantastic. Staff was helpful, easy taxi ride to the airport",5,2016,04,22
211,Spacious room and friendly staff,"The personnel was extremely service oriented and friendly.
Free parking was a bonus.
The traffic is different from other (continental) countries, and we choose to walk to the city instead of driving. Didn't try breakfast.",4,2016,04,21
211,Stag do,"Although not my personal choice among the many hotels in Dublin, this ended up at great stay with us all,15 of us, little far away from all the bars and shopping but an easy walk into the centre, would defiantly stay again as it has everything you would need and staff very attentive",5,2016,04,20
211,Nice hotel shame about the location,"Stayed here for three nights in April. 
We had two rooms one for teenage children and of course another for us. We took advantage of price deal to upgrade to Executive Rooms. The rooms were nicely appointed with usual features one would expect. of a hotel of this rating. Bathroom came with complimentary shampoo, soaps and conditioner all of a high standard. Staying in executive rooms gained access to the exec lounge which included breakfast. I appreciate for some people that a continental style is not to everyone taste but we found it ample with fruit, variety of rolls and bread, cheese ham, cereal and yogurts; set us all up for the morning - personally do not have a problem recommending. The exec lounge also provided coffee, teas, bottled waters and fruit juices all day...again very handy.
The public areas were clean and well appointed. A mention for the bar which was popular and had a busy atmosphere not normally found in hotels of this nature. On one occasion we decided to purchase food in bar and was pleasantly surprised.
So the elephant in the room...location! If you want to visit Croke park stadium it is literally across the road - great! If you want to visit the city centre we timed it as 15 mins walk to O'Connell street with another 5+ minutes to Temple Bar area... all good. So what is problem...well nothing in reality but the perception is different. The hotel is among the chimney pots with stadium one side, canal the other, train tracks on the third (never noticed the train)  I must emphasise we NEVER experienced any problems but I did feel that I was on my guard, and did not fancy walking back late at night- probably being too over cautious!
Buses are approx 5 minute walk and will get you around and about cheaply and easily.
Finally a special mention for all of the staff. There were always staff around willing to help and very friendly.
So would I stay again....I don't know the title sums up my feeling",3,2016,04,20
211,It's brown!,"I know that this is a strange title for this review but it was my wife's initial reaction after arriving at the hotel and going to our room and I must admit, she's right. The corridors are brown, the bedroom walls are brown, the furniture in the room is brown, everything is brown. A couple of brightly coloured pictures in the room or something would have made a world of difference. It was one of those experiences where you could have been in a hotel room anywhere in the world really.

Having said all of that, the hotel was beautifully clean. The staff were very attentive and I particularly liked the fact that everyone, including all of the cleaning staff, said ""Good morning"". Really good full, Irish breakfast although we did go into the bar at lunchtime on our first day and ordered a sandwich and coffee and the (brown!) bread was disappointing. It seemed as though it had come straight out of a Hovis wrapper. There are some many fabulous bread available these days that it was a shame that the kitchen had to use processed bread.

Also, if I was going to be hyper-critical, a little more in the way of tea and coffee making facilities would have been good. Two tea bags and two sachets of coffee along with four of those little milk cartons don't go very far with two people staying in the room.

Special mention of the two concierges who were excellent!",4,2016,04,20
211,Nice 4 star hotel,"Nice and very friendly 4 star hotel. Very clean. Breakfast is at 4 star hotel level. The minus is location (if you did not come specially for some sport even to nearby stadium). The hotel located at not very welcoming district, 10 minutes walk to the nearest bus stop.",5,2016,04,20
211,Great hotel with very helpful staff,"I stayed in this hotel with my husband and 2 kids. My in laws were also staying here. We stayed here knowing there were no facilities as such for kids but booked it anyway for convenience as we had a function in Croke park. 
The hotel decor is very modern and really clean. The rooms are so spacious and very comfortable. There was plenty of space for all four of us in our room. 
We ate in the bar for dinner. The staff were incredibly friendly. The menu initially didn't impress me as I didn't think there was a great choice but wow did it impress when I got my meal. I got one of the broccoli, beetroot and feta salad and added chicken  and I must say it was one of the nicest I ever tasted. The only negative was that our order took ages to be served. We ate with a large group and understandably it was going to take some time but one of our group got her meal and finished it before all the rest of us got ours but as i said the food was so good the delay was almost acceptable. Everyone in our group was incredibly impressed with the food. 
I must also make a point to compliment the staff at reception. During the night my two boys started vomiting which lasted all morning. I explained our situation at reception, just so they could take appropriate steps when cleaning the room especially as the boys had picked up a bug. They offered us bottles of water to take home with us and gave me some plastic bags to use just in case of accidents in the car. I was so stressed out with my disastrous night that this kind gesture meant so much. 
Overall our stay was very pleasant and the staff were fantastic.  If the hotel had playroom and/or swimming pool it would definatly be a great choice for families but despite this it is still a great choice for a stay in the capital.",5,2016,04,19
211,Good Service,"I was at the Hotel from Saturday to Thursday, 2 days on Vacation and 3 days for work. The Hotel is nice, just in front of Croke Park Stadium, very confortable for me cause I was doibg some trainnings at the Stadium with my company. Front Desk was great very helpfull all the time. Really good service, the team at the Restaurant also was great. Room facilities very confortable, it is nice to have a Kettle for my morning coffee, nice Safety Deposit Box and a good Ironing staff in the room.
The service in the Bar was excellent also in the morning breakfast.
 The location, is not the best in town but only 10 minutes walking distance from Oconnel´s street, it was not a handicap for us.",5,2016,04,19
211,Great experience,"Was very impressed with this hotel. Room and hotel were very clean. Hotel staff were all very helpful, and knowledgeable. Food was also good, decent bar area. Location was very quiet, and was easy walking to the downtown area from there.",4,2016,04,19
211,Awesome Place To Stay,"I liked this hotel.  The breakfast was awesome.  It was a good way to start the day and keep you full for a while lol.  Dublin offered a hop on, hop off tour bus with the first stop right at the hotel.  Its not in the middle of the city so if you're there to party and walk everywhere, this might not be the one for you.  If you're there for anything site seeing and a nice trip this is a good place to consider. ",5,2016,04,18
211,Fab stay,"We stayed 2 nights mid-week.  First impressions were that it was a very well kept and modern hotel with lovely reception area.  All staff were friendly and helpful.  The room was great and bed massive if a little firm but that's personal preference.  Shower was cold everytime we used it but we didn't complain as we didn't want the hassle to change rooms and wasn't a big deal to us.  Free prosecco was sent to our room as a birthday gift which was so nice.  Bar and restaurant lovely, we had breakfast and evening meal there and both were great.  Location for us was fine, right next to the football ground but no games on when we were there.  Nice walk into town of about 20 mins and we also got bus to and from airport which was only a short and easy walk to hotel.  
Seems more of a business hotel in week and perhaps more tourists on weekend.  Definitely recommend and would stay again no hesitation",4,2016,04,18
211,Saturday night stay,"Very comfortable hotel with extremely professional, welcoming staff.  We had a lovely family room that had plenty of space for the 1 adult and 2 kids that stayed.  Very clean room with good facilities.  My only dissatisfaction with the room is that the duvets are really just sheets, no heat in them.  I had to ring for a blanket about 1 am as I couldn't sleep I was so cold.  Heating system is air-conditioning which I dislike as fan keeps me awake.  Night porter very quickly brought blanket and offered me a heater too.  We had dinner in the bar which was lovely and breakfast in restaurant which offered a really good selection.  Its a great location and a really lovely hotel.  Good value for money for Dublin.  Breakfast free for under 12's too was an added bonus as we were on room only rate.  Free secure car parking too,",4,2016,04,18
211,Great Base. ,"We stayed at the croke Park for my girlfriend's birthday with friends. As a base for visiting pubs and shopping it couldn't get any better. I think I've visited quite a few hotels in this type so know what to expect and the croke Park held no surprises. To temple bar it was about ten euros in a taxi or its a 20 minute walk to the millennium spire. The bar staff can't do enough for you but quick tip,  you can eat off the bar menu (cheaper) in the restaurant if you ask. Overall we had a great stay over two nights but spent too much on taxis. ",5,2016,04,17
211,A surprise for my Husband,"Arriving at The Croke Park Hotel was wonderfull. A very big welcome from front desk staff who could not do enough to make our stay enjoyable. Room comforts were exceptional. Beds great, Linen crisp and pillows soft, bathroom large with all amenities. Towel by Lissadell were just so good, Bobby Rusk would be so pleased. 
The hotel was busting at the seams with Gaelic football suporters, all the staff were flat out and the security were in charge a special note to their efforts.
The food did not live up to the standard one would expect from a Major Hotel Group of this quality and the bar prices were just as expensive, while the bar price is the bar  price the food was expensive for the fair on offer but  most of all was not particulary appealing. It may have been a match day but we were not there for the match, could do much better on quality. The service in the restaurant was again first class and we had plenty of attention from the staff, all so polite.
This hotel is a credit to its General Manager as everything there was working to his orders and was working like clockwork and that showed in what was a pressured situation.",5,2016,04,17
211,"Nice, comfortable stay",We stayed here for a few nights while visiting Dublin.  The hotel was very nice and comfortable.  The staff were very kind.  We used the bus to get around the city during our stay which was quite convenient.  The only thing that would make it better is if there were a stop closer to the hotel.  Other than that it was a pleasant stay.,5,2016,04,16
211,Excellent hotel ,I stayed in the Croke Park for a week while I was on a training course and it was a fantastic experience. This hotel is a four star with five star staff and service! From the moment I arrived there was no task too big. Colin in the Sideline Bistro went over and above on every request (keep up the good work)! The food is lovely (I'd recommend the lamb shoulder). It is a 20 minute walk to Dublin City Centre (have the brolly at the ready!) and the hotel has complimentary parking (very difficult to get this in Dublin City!). If you're in Dublin on business or pleasure please stay in this hotel!!,5,2016,04,16
211,Brilliant,"Enthusiastic and very welcoming and helpful staff, the room was perfect. The the walk-in-shower room was brilliant as I have mobility issues & there was plenty shelf space by the sink area and in the shower itself. Great price, location & parking.",5,2016,04,15
211,Awesome hotel!,"This hotel was awesome! We only stayed for one night and didn't get to eat or use the leisure center but the service was great and the room was very nice. We got some ice cream for our daughter and it was fantastic. The Croke Park Stadium is right across the street so if you are going for an event I would definitely stay here. If you want to be closer to Dublin City Center then this is not the place to stay, it's on the North side and City Center is on the South. There may be more stuff to do around this are but we didn't get an opportunity to check it out much.",5,2016,04,15
211,High Quality Hotel and value price,"I was impressed with a recent stay at the Croke Park Hotel whilst on a business trip.  
The staff were efficient and friendly.  
The rooms were spacious, well laid out and furnished to the highest of standards.  
The price per stay was competitive and value for money, especially when the free parking aspect is included.
I will be staying in the Croke Park Hotel again and will be happy to recommend it to friends and colleagues",5,2016,04,15
211,Basic hotel in need of some upgrades,"I spent two nights here traveling on business. The hotel was approved by corporate travel and had decent ratings. While it met my basic needs, there was some room for improvement. On the positive side, breakfast was included and had a wide range of options which were very good. On the down side, the location is remote unless you want to be next to the stadium. It was not near the center of the city or the Docklands. Some minor annoyances included the key system. There is one for the elevator that you have to use all of the time. Mine failed to work as did my room key. Seems like an antiquated system. Second, there is a boom box in the room from the 90's with a CD player. That is probably the last time the room was refreshed and was indicative of all of the amenities, which were on the older side. A/C or heat did not work effectively - no matter how high or low I cranked the temperature, it had no affect on the fan speed or room temperature. Wifi worked great but there was no authentication which concerned me. With that said, the hotel was very clean, the rooms are very large and there is plenty of working space for the business traveler. I stayed there because corporate determined that it was value priced, but you get what you pay for.",3,2016,04,14
211,Excellent stay in Dublin,"This was our second time staying at The Croke Park hotel. We like the location, quiet area, but close enough to walk to the centre of town. The hotel itself is a comfortable and welcoming place to stay. All of the staff we came into contact with were friendly and helpful. We would definitely consider staying at the hotel again and would recommend it to others.",5,2016,04,14
211,A fine place to stay while exploring Dublin,"Easy to get to from the airport on the north side of town.  A spacious, semi secure parking garage has lots of space.  A large, modern room complete with a nearly brand new  bath tub and shower.  Trendy bar with amazing fish and chips; perfect with a Guinness.  It is literally next to Croke Park Stadium, but a good, 30 minute walk from the center of town.  This is good to see a bit more of the city, but can be a hike if you want to get to central sites.",5,2016,04,13
211,Fantastic hotel,Stayed at the hotel for my wife's 40th birthday the hotel did not disappoint food 10/10 staff 10/10 cannot fault it rooms spotlessly clean if you are looking somewhere in Dublin you  cant look past this place book with confidence ,5,2016,04,13
211,Lovely hotel,"What a lovely hotel, staff are warm, friendly and professional.. Rooms are great, spacious, spotlessly clean and comfortable. Great location, free car park is a bonus.. Bar food and breakfast all lovely.",5,2016,04,12
211,Beautiful hotel and fantastic staff!,"We stayed here for 3 nights and loved every minute of it. The rooms are beautiful, have great facilities, and are spotlessly clean. We were on the second floor overlooking the courtyard and had no noise problems. My partner had told staff that we were there to celebrate my birthday, and they gave me a small card and complimentary prosecco. It was so kind of them!

Their attention to detail is wonderful - hot towels at reception on arrival, good quality toiletries in the bathroom, lovely tea/coffee facilities etc. The staff could not have been more helpful and provided an excellent service both in the bar, at breakfast, and at the desk. 

The hotel is expensive, but you won't find a cheap hotel in Dublin that is so high quality, and it is worth spending that bit extra for the level of luxury you get. It is not that much more than other hotels, and even though it looks liker a long way out of the city, it took us 15 minutes to get onto O'Connell Street. So, it is really accessible.

If we came back to Dublin, we would definitely stay here again! Thanks to all the staff for a wonderful stay.",5,2016,04,12
211,Excellent ,"First time I stayed here having stayed in many other hotels in Dublin and this has been my favourite.The reception stay were very friendly on arrival.I had booked a superior room as it wasn't that much more expensive than a standard room.The king size bed was huge,lovely bathroom with excellent shower and super soft towels.Breakfast was tasty and again the staff were very attentive.I can certainly recommend this hotel from my experience.",5,2016,04,12
211,Great stay!,"My self and my parents had an overnight stay in this hotel last weekend and we were delighted with the quality. The best were very comfortable, the room was really well equipped and breakfast was delicious, especially loved the way the porridge was served freshly prepared to order.",5,2016,04,11
211,"Excellent hotel, wonderful staff",My two young children and I stayed here for one night. The room was large and very comfortable and the large bathroom was brilliantly equipped. The breakfast (included in the price) was delicious with a ton of different healthy and fresh choices. The  chef was amazingly helpful and made the kids pancakes and the staff at the check-in/check-out desk were very helpful and courteous. I would not hesitate in staying here again. ,5,2016,04,11
211,Great place to stay in Dublin,"Overall stay was excellent. Clean room, bathroom. Hotel was easy to find on GPS and only 10 minute drive into centre.  So location was really good.  Breakfast was lovely. Had lunch at the bar and that was nice as well.  Only negative was the size of the bed.  We had a triple room with a double and single bed but the double bed was tiny!  That was the only drawback.  ",4,2016,04,11
211,Class Hotel,"We stayed at this hotel for one night as we were in Dublin on a night out. Hotel itself was lovely and clean, we had a room on the 4th floor. The room was fab, the room itself was big and clean, bed was comfy.The staff were pleasant and even helped us order a dominoes pizza upon our return from out night out. We did pay extra for breakfast and while it was nice i do think it was a little over priced. Hotel is in a good location approx 10 euros if that from hotel to temple bar area.",5,2016,04,11
211,Great hotel with friendly and efficient staff,"We've just returned from a 4 night stay and had a lovely time. There was an issue when we checked in as the room we had booked wasn't available but the manager on duty that night was excellent. We were put into a different room for one night on the understanding we should just leave our bags the following day and they would move us. They also offered us complimentary drinks to apologise for the inconvenience which was very welcome as we had not had the best of journeys to get there.  

Both the rooms we stayed in were spacious and clean with very comfortable beds and white company toiletries.

The only downside was that the surrounding area seems a bit run down but considering its less than 10 Euro in a taxi to the centre of town this wasn't an issue for us.  We walked into town and it took around 10 - 15 minutes but in the evenings we went for taxi's.  ",4,2016,04,10
211,Mediocre,"We chose this hotel as it was a package deal of bed, breakfast, evening meal & entry to the zoo, based on reviews. I find it hard to believe that this hotel is ranked number 4 in the whole of Dublin. We were given the wrong menu on 2 occasions at dinner time in the bistro. The Guinness bread, in my opinion, was stale, but maybe that's the way it was meant to be as I'd never had it before. The butternut squash in my risotto was undercooked & there was no real flavour other than salt. We had drinks in the bar & were brought, what we thought as we didn't order them, complimentary nuts & crisps. I paid for the drinks & then woke up the next morning to a bill put under our door while included the nuts & crisps! While it was very clean, the decor of the room we stayed in was a bit dated. The pillows were too soft too & there was a huge gap under the door & the light from the corridor shine in all night. Our room was at the front of the hotel which overlooked the road which was a bit noisy. Having said all that, the breakfast was very good, lots of variety & well stocked. The staff were also very pleasant. Would I stay here again? Probably not, I have stayed in better hotels in the area. ",3,2016,04,10
211,Lovely hotel,"Arrived just before a GAA game at the Croke Park Stadium which is across the road.  Hotel very busy. Had made arrangements with hotel for a transfer for six people. Big mix up - only sent a saloon car so it had to do two journeys to airport and back. Concierge couldnt apologise anymore. Went to check in. Receptionist said the cost was £269 which equated to approx. 340 euros.  Said no price was in Euros.  She said contacted the duty manager Kathleen who also said no it was defo £269 because we had upgraded and that is what the cost would be.  Couldn't prove anything because my brother who had the confirmation was still at airport.  Wouldn't let us check in! Brother arrived and lo and behold it was 269 euros!!  Kathleen apologised. gave us couple of drinks vouchers and a voucher for breakfast in return.  Eventually checked in. Room was big and lovely. Bed massive. Lovely shower and small sitting area. As we had upgraded we had access to the executive lounge which provided drinks and snacks.  Lounge slightly small given the amount of executive rooms which could upgrade.  Continental breakfast OK. One morning we waiting for approx. 20 mins for rolls and cutlery to be provided otherwise fine.  The bistro bar was lovely. Great food and reasonably priced drink. Staff very good and attentive.  We used our ""free"" breakfast voucher on our last morning. Lots to choose from.  Our bill was placed under our door when we were at breakfast.  Was charged for a Red Bull which I cannot even stand the smell of never mind drink! Went to reception to pay and advise them of error re red bull. Receptionist printed out another bill and, surprise surprise, we had been charged for the breakfast.  Same for my brother - hotel attempted to charge him too!!  Apart from the small mishaps hotel is lovely and if it was only a wee bit nearer the city centre I would definitely stay again.",4,2016,04,10
211,Great family stay!,We stayed for 2 nights the week before Easter.  We had a fabulous stay.  The room was spacious enough for our family of four.  We had a bus pass so we took the bus to and from the sights downtown.  We ate at the pizza/wine bar a few doors down and it was fabulous.  Breakfast was excellent and a great value since the kids ate free.  We'll definitely return if we find ourselves in Dublin again.,5,2016,04,09
211,Trendy place!!,We stayed here on our last night as part of a tour group.  It is closer to the airport.  More modern styling and very beautiful rooms and comfortable bed.  The full Irish breakfast in the morning was delicious and huge!  Set up buffet style.  Nice and quiet.,5,2016,04,09
211,Comfortable stay,"Pros: Stayed here for four nights. Three of us stayed in one room. The room was very clean. Good room service. Parking was free and the parking lot was spacious. Good money value. 
Cons: The staff at the reception could be more friendly. Ice machine not working. Breakfast serving was slow and some servers were very unprofessional. The neighborhood looked a bit dangerous. After 9pm or so, the streets were very dark without or so little street lights. 
In order to get in the city you have to walk about 25 minutes. You could take a bus but it takes about the same time during rush hours and the bus stop is not close from the hotel.",4,2016,04,09
211,Comfortable clean good food,"About 14 minutes from ferry port. €160 night for two people. Complimentary wine. Access to Exec Lounge which is un attended and poor range of refreshments. Good size comfortable and clean room with bath (and shower) without handles for old fogeys. Good value meals, pleasant efficient and professional staff. Safe oarking undr ground. Sceure access to floors by lift. No usb charging pointsbin rooms. 7/9 euros to Oconnell street by taxi. Good internet service.",4,2016,04,09
211,Comfortable and reasonably priced,My wife and I spent three nights at the Croke Park Hotel as we were visiting family in Dublin. The hotel was very clean the staff super friendly. We had a standard double room. Tthe room was very comfortable the bathroom had a bath as well a separate full size shower. A very good sized room which we felt very comfortable in and all for £87 per night which I thought was very reasonable,5,2016,04,08
211,Great hotel,"We have just stopped here for 2 night short break. Myself, husband and son. We went to Dublin in October and stopped at the best western. We arrived very early both times and the first time left the bags and went off. Check in was 2pm but couldn't get in till 3pm which was annoying. This time we arrived At the croke park hotel and were given hot towels to refresh us which they did and omg the room was ready which was great. All the staff were helpful and welcoming. I spoke to the concierge the week before about hiring a car and left him to organise it which he did. It's easy to get to from the airport you can get number 16 bus to drumcondra train station and it's just down the road much cheaper than a taxi. Walking into Dublin is about 15mins. We ate out so not sure about the food but up the road is a nice Italian. Worth a visit would definitely stop here again. ",5,2016,04,08
211,"Great hotel, as always","This would be my favorite hotel in Dublin if it were a little more centrally located. We often stay there when traveling around the country and need someplace for a couple of nights before going to the airport, as it so close. This time we were there visiting someone at the Mater Hospital, which was a few blocks away, but normally, we would prefer to stay nearer to Grafton Street (where we often stay at the sister hotel, the Westbury). But the price, room size, amenities, food, etc. at this hotel are all terrific. It doesn't look very inviting from the outside, but once you are inside, it's a warm, friendly, great place.",5,2016,04,08
211,Excellent hotel with great service and staff.,"My girlfriend and I stayed for 4 nights and had an amazing stay. A lovely clean and well presented hotel in a good location.
The staff were fantastic especially Frane and Tomiasz in the bar who were very friendly and chatted away with customers.
Only down side was the shower in the room, didn't always keep temperature of hot water up but other than that excellent!",4,2016,04,08
211,Fantastic staff,"From the second we arrived until the minute we left, the receptionists and concierge were superb. Each went the extra mile to make us feel like valued guests - hot towels to freshen up on arrival and the offer of water for our journey when we left.
The room was also great. 2 double beds in the family room and a big bathroom with White Company toiletries.
Just a few little things let te hotel down: insufficient provisions on the hospitality tray ( 1 hot chocolate when we have 2 children and only 3 biscuits/cups between 4); lowest room temperature which is way too hot overnight; a short lead on the hairdryer which makes using the mirror a challenge and the castors on the bed which makes sitting up in it virtually impossible!! Personally, we also found the cost of breakfast to be prohibitively high for a family.
None of the 'negatives' would be difficult to fix so we look forward to giving the hotel 5 stars when we return!",4,2016,04,07
211,Great stay,Booked this hotel after reading the many positive reviews on this site. Not disappointed. Our first room allocated was adapted for a disabled visitor and had no bath. We were quickly allocated another room which was well furnished and very comfortable/clean. 15 min walk to town centre and close to bus and rail service,4,2016,04,07
211,excellence,had an excellent stay at croke park hotel dublin 27/10/2016. This hotel is truly exceptional as nothing is to much trouble .The standards of this hotel are more than a match for the £500.00 a night hotels in new york in fact i feel this hotel surpasses them .The food the standard of cleanliness the staff so polite so helpful .I would not dream of staying anywhere else whilst in dublin .I was on my own at this stay however i am taking all my family there in august in the full knowledge i will be taking them to a hotel of true excellence.Thank you so much croke park . Connelly,5,2016,04,07
211,Short trip in Dublin,"Well situated but a little bit far from central of Dublin.
You must walk 20 minutes to be in the central.
The room is clean and big enough for 3 persons. The hotel is very quiet.
The breakfast is a bit expansive but complete [White and black pudding, eggs, beans, cheese...]
If you have a child, there is a park not far from the hotel.",4,2016,04,07
211,Cousins Hen Doo - 22 girls & 7 rooms booked,"Had a great weekend, hotel was amazing for the price. the best value. Travelled to Dublin for my cousins hen doo, there was 22 of us so large group to accommodate. 
We were able to all be on the 3rd floor.
Rooms were cleaned daily and spare towels and bathroom lotions offered by the maids as we passed them. 
Had the hot breakfast on the first day which was very good value and very nice. had everything you could want.
only thing stopping me from selecting 5 stars was the fact that I was up before the rest of my group hungover slightly and would have loved to get a cup of tea. first day I ordered one at the bar he said ok he would bring it over, 20 minutes later, still no tea despite being the only person in bar. I hadn't realised I had a minibar in my room at this point which again was disappointing because I had one bottle of water, a chocolate bar and mini vodka. Not a lot of choice at all and I would have paid 100s for something to drink. 

Great hotel though and definatly will return when I visit Dublin again.",4,2016,04,06
211,4-Night Family Stay,"Believe me, I don't work for TA, but got to say the site came up trumps again, this time selecting a hotel for a family visit to Dublin (2 adults and 2 children - actually adults but still our kids!).

Arrival and check-in was good and very friendly.

We stayed in a superior room with two double beds - great modern room, plenty of space, comfy beds (although a bit too easy to move), spacious spotless bathroom, hot drinks and those posh caramel coffee biscuits that you could probably eat ten of. The list of useful things goes on - free safe, free wifi, TV, hairdryer, ironing board and iron, trouser press, mini bar.

We had breakfast on a couple of days - well worth the money - full irish one day and then continental (even I need a rest from full cooked breakfasts - as my wife reminded me!!!)

We also took up residence in the bar for a couple of nights whilst meeting family - the service here is excellent, very attentive but not in your face, friendly and accommodating (at one point there were 11 of us and seats appeared without even asking - never seen that anywhere else ever - very impressed).

I must also mention the great concierge service - again all friendly and efficient - alarm call, taxi for the airport, printing our boarding passes.

Additionally, we booked the Dublin Bus 3 day freedom ticket - a shuttle bus to the city centre picks up from the hotel - but regular buses too and from the city centre are only a 5 minute walk away. The city itself is only a 20 minute walk (O'Connell Street), so if you don't know Dublin and you're slightly put off by the location - don't be!

So the all important question - would I stay again? - absolutely without hesitation, highly recommended and worth the high TA rating.",5,2016,04,06
211,Great Hotel,"We stayed just after the Easter bank holiday, the staff were very welcoming and the hotel was spotless! Ideally situated just outside of the city centre. We didn't eat in the restaurant as we were out about all day, we did have the full cooked breakfast there which was superb! On our final morning due to time we opted for the continental breakfast which didn't impress our teenage son and one of the chefs came out and asked if he would prefer pancakes. He bought them over within a few minutes. Nothing was to much trouble! I know where we will be staying on our next visit to Dublin. Thank you to all the staff at The Croke Park Hotel. :)",5,2016,04,05
211,Average Stay,"Rooms were in excellent condition and very clean.

Location was probably not the best as we had to take a taxi everywhere.

Beds were comfortable.

I spent 3 nights at the hotel, the television didn't work and on the third day just before checkout the television was replaced - but this was too little to late.

I booked 3 rooms and we had a group of 8, whilst we were out we met some old friends and invited them back to the hotel where we already had our own supply of alcohol however the security would not allow them in the hotel, our friends decided to go back to their hotel, they called a taxi and asked if they could wait in the lobby area whilst their taxi arrived as it was very cold outside however the security were quite aggressive and would not allow them to come in.

Summary - good hotel, just don't bring back any guests!",3,2016,04,05
211,Great hotel,Good location great staff great service will be visiting again not far from city centre fifteen minute walk . Twenty euro in a taxi from airport and if you want there's a takeaway three minutes away. Don't forget to check out Croke Park sky walk at the stadium opposite.,5,2016,04,03
211,Excellent!,Had a wonderful time at this hotel. I booked this trip as a birthday present for my boyfriend and both Dublin and the hotel were amazing. The staff were friendly and provided a great atmosphere. The beds were extremely comfortable and the shower was brilliant. We also had room service one of the nights and this was delicious. Will definitely return to this hotel when we next return to Dublin! ,5,2016,04,03
211,Perfect,"We have just returned from a wonderful 3 night stay at the hotel. The hotel staff could not do enough to help and were all warm, freindly and approcable. Check in was fast, our room was lovely and spotlessly clean. We also had a lovely suprise to have been left 2 x small bottles of prosecco as we were staying to celebrate our anniversary.  The bathroom was moden and very clean, lovely fluffy towels and cremes/showergels etc from 'The White Company'.  Beds were super comfy - comfiest hotel beds i've slept in. Room lovely and  warm. Also had iron and hairdryer which came in useful.  Breakfast was the best we've ever had, paid 15 euro each - children eat free - and it was worth every penny.  Good selection of meat/cheese/cereals. Beautiful quality sausage,bacon. White/black pudding, hash browns, beans, mushrooms, toast, fried/scrambled,boiled eggs. Soda bread/croissants, fresh fruit. 4 fruit juices. Toast,tea, coffee, hot chocolate made and brought to table. Pancakes made for our son, fresh by chef with nutella/fruit and cream, he loved these! There was a even a honey comb, which you could get bees honey from plus natural yogurts other sauces etc. We had a huge breakfast and that was plenty until tea time. 

We had a couple of drinks in the bar, very reasonable - approx 4 euro for a pint of lager.  We never ate in the hotel but can recommend a wine bar down the road called Asti Wallace. We opted for 2 courses and a glas of wine for 17.95 euro. The food was lovely. We had no problem at 6.15pm getting a table but it was very busy by 6.45pm swo would recommend pre booking. We also had a take out from the Savoy chip shop down the road - very good kebabs and childrens meals.  There is a SPAR near by where you can buy wine etc for the room also.  Hotel has free wifi which worked brilliantly and free desk top computers in the foyer. There is also a gym - free bottles of water included - my husband used this and found it to be of a reasonable standard.
Hotel concierge was very helpful, always smiling and more than happy to assist with trips and travel plus any other questions.

Getting to the hotel is very easy from airport.  Drumondra station is a very simple 10 min walk and about the same from bus stop. Buses run frequently from airport and it was about 5euro for the 3 of us to go from airport to hotel. Just ask at tourist information at arrivals and they will direct you to the stop. They many offer you the 33euro 3 day pass, unless you are going to be doing a lot of travel this may work out more expensive.  

Getting from the hotel to Dublin centre is about a 15 min walk to the beginning of town, we did this one day with our 6 year old and he didnt complain once! Obviously the further into town you go the longer it will take to walk there.  Buses back were frequently, and there are lots of tourist information centres to ask if you get stuck.

Please feel free to message if you have any questions...",5,2016,04,03
211,Great overnight stay - discover Dublin package ,"I have just returned from a last minute overnight stay in the Croke Park hotel . We arrived on a wet Friday afternoon and the early check in was great . We had warm hand towels at reception and a friendly welcome . Our room on the3 rd floor was very spacious and had two large double beds with a view overlooking the stadium . The decor is modern and the bathroom luxurious. I love the White Company toiletries which smell divine ! The room has a CD player and TV which has ample choice of films at £6.95 per view . We took advantage of the complementary Hop on Hop off Dublin bus tours .We had a great time doing the tour despite the rain and the bus driver left us back near the hotel as it was on his way home .The meal in the bistro was superb . My son had a medium sirloin steak with mashed potato and pepper sauce . I had a freshly cooked salmon with roasted root veg and potato gratin ... The nicest meal I have had in a long time . There were cocktails included in our package and they were delicious . We had no room for dessert ! The restaurant was busy but service was excellent . The bar was crowded so we headed back to our room to enjoy an in house movie .Breakfast next day was equally impressive and we finished our trip with another bus tour of Dublin with pick up and drop off right outside the hotel door . This is a great way of seeing plenty of sights and getting around quickly . The drivers are very friendly and the humour is well worth the trip .We would definitely recommend the Croke Park Hotel for a short Dublin break . It is very accessible for Northerners and the free car parking and hop on bus tour saves a bit of money too .

211,Retirement Night,"Fantastic night  in the Croke Park on the occasion of my retirement. 120 family, friends and colleagues were served an excellent dinner. A large number of friends attending after the meal were also well catered for. Stayed overnight in a very comfortable room. Excellent breakfast  in the morning. My sincere thanks to Sean Reid, Catherine McKenna, Sarah McCabe, all the housekeeping, event, concierge and reception staff for their hospitality. All are a credit to Alan Smullen, the general manager. Thank you so much. Gerry",5,2016,04,03
211,A really good hotel,"The hotel is not set in the best area but it does not take long to walk into town. It is a very good hotel and the staff are brilliant. Personally I was not impressed with the executive lounge . The range provided was limited and it was not serviced regularly.
The continental breakfast served in this lounge was not as good as in the restaurant. I would not bother again with this facility",4,2016,04,01
211,"Comfortable, modern hotel","Came to Dublin for a 3 night city break, the staff were very helpful after a room confusion and we were quickly and very kindly dealt with, no hassle! Room and bathroom was clean and the bed was amazing! However the air con was very noisy at night and the hop on hop off service bus was right outside our room and woke us up a few times! Although fairly close to the city centre it was still a 20/30 minute walk but there was a bus route nearby! Only thing that put me off slightly was the area was a bit run down however once in the hotel all of this was forgotten as it was so nice! Would definitely recommend.",4,2016,04,01
211,Excellent Hotel,Loved staying at this hotel.  The room was clean and the bed comfortable.  The Hop on Hop off bus stops just across the street.  Food was good and the staff was very helpful and always had a smile.  I would stay there again when visiting Dublin Ireland.,5,2016,04,01
211,Superb Hotel,"One of the best hotels we have stayed in, from start to finish.
The staff were excellent, very friendly and personal. We were given hot towels on our arrival and made very welcome. There was ample covered car parking which was free. Free car parking is rare in Dublin. Staff looked after us throughout our stay from reception, bar, restaurant and housekeeping. The hotel is about 15/20 minutes walk from O'Connell Street or 10 Euro in a taxi. We taxied to the 3 Arena for a concert and that was also 10 Euro. The room was spacious and very clean with a great shower. Bar and restaurant was very comfortable and service was quick and friendly. All in all a great hotel with no negative points. We will return. Also, thanks to Siobhan for the Prosecco!! Lovely touch.",5,2016,03,31
211,Wonderful ,"We stayed for 3 nights 26-29 March over Easter to enjoy the celebrations in Dublin. We had a fantastic time. The location is perfect, the staff wonderful and free wifi is great. We had a minor problem on check in as the room upgrade we had booked was not available but it was sorted very quickly. We stayed on the 4th floor which was lovely, it was good to have the executive suite as another place to sit and have a coffee or a drink. Nothing was too much trouble for the staff, the friendliest and nicest staff in any hotel we have stayed in. We had a great breakfast there every morning. The only criticism we had is the bistro menu was really uninspiring as so we ate elsewhere every night. Would love to see a new menu there, other than that it was all perfect. We had a great room, a very comfy bed and it was really quiet. We wouldn't hesitate to recommend it or to stay there again. ",5,2016,03,31
211,Wonderful staff,"I stayed 3 nights at The Croke Park hotel as it was very convenient for visiting the Mater hospital . It worked out perfect being only a 15 minute walk away . 
The hotel is lovely , spotlessly clean & had lovely spacious rooms . 
The staff were so polite & helpful & extremely professional .  The front office managers Catherine & Siobhan were very accommodating . 
I would highly recommend this hotel ",5,2016,03,31
211,Centenary celebration ,Absolutely amazing stay at this hotel. All staff were very friendly & helpful. Hotel was super clean & food was top quality. Live music each night with a relaxed atmosphere. Will definitely stay again!,5,2016,03,31
211,cant wait to return,"best hotel I have ever stayed in , professional staff  everyone very friendly , really seamed pleased to see you , nothing to much trouble , arrived Easter week , every room booked , staff coped as if it was business as usual ,,,    I am back in April ,, cant wait .. ",5,2016,03,31
211,Irish Grand National weekend,"The hotel was great, we arrived (four adults) for four nights during a very busy period in Dublin with the centenary of the 1916 uprising. The main areas and rooms were very spacious and clean throughout.The staff from reception to the restaurant were always happy and a pleasure to deal with.The food was excellent in the bistro and breakfast was really enjoyable with a great selection. The Guinness was second to none and thoroughly enjoyed by myself and friend. For us the location was ideal with easy access to main line stations and although a longish walk into Dublin shopping centre it walked off the breakfast. We hopefully will return in rhe not to distant future.",5,2016,03,30
211,Great hotel!,"Stayed here five nights in March and the Croke Park Hotel lived up to our expectations.  We arrived 7:30AM Sunday morning after and transatlantic flight knowing it was a very slim chance a room would be available.  Much to our surprise we were presented with a room key at 9:30AM - how wonderful to have a quick hour nap before hitting the streets of Dublin!
Our room was nicely appointed and the bathroom was a very generous size with nice toiletries.  Shower is very big - what a treat in Europe.  Our room was very clean and the noise from the tracks was not an issue.  Only noise was from fellow guests who let room doors slam rather than close gently.  An easy 20 minute walk to tourist area of Dublin and had no issues with safety.
All of the staff we encountered were very welcoming and professional.  Thanks to all at Croke Park - you are a credit to the industry.",5,2016,03,30
211,Just.. Excellent!,"The Croke Park Hotel was actually the best choice.. The hotel itself was luxurious, spacious rooms, perfect lobby area for drinks, exceptional breakfast and dining area with open kitchen, helpful and very polite staff! Really, couldn't ask for more.. It's exactly next to the Croke Park Stadium. The nearest public transportation stop is: Drumcondra (5min walking distance from the hotel). The city Centre is at about 15min by foot away.. If you like to walk around the city it'll be easy for you to get around! We ll definitely stay there again!!
Tip: Buy your voucher for the full Irish Breakfast for 12€/per person than pay it in the breakfast area for 14,50! ",5,2016,03,29
211,great location,"Another  great stay in this lovely  hotel  staff  lovely  room very  comfortable and clean, food lovely  if like me and you dont do full breakfast  in mornings you can  get  a smaller  selection  in the hotel bar it is lovely and a good selection, served very professional  by a lovely waiter and presented just as carefully  as  a top restaurant.",5,2016,03,29
211,Wonderful hotel with a great atmosphere,"The hotel was excellent. The staff were very friendly and nothing was too much trouble for them. The hotel itself was spotless and the bedrooms were all a good size with comfy beds and wonderful  bathrooms. The food, especially the breakfasts, were great. We will definitely be returning.",5,2016,03,29
211,Must be the Best Hotel in Dublin!,"Stayed here for a night whilst attending a concert in the 3Arena. Got it at a reasonable price on-line too which is always good!. Free underground parking for guests was the first pleasant surprise. Lovely public areas, free WiFi and really friendly and efficient staff at check-in was the next pluses. We got a room on the 3rd floor, looking onto the iconic Croke Park stadium. Really modern room with a massive king sized bed and well kitted out. A dream room to return to after a long day out.
The buffet breakfast the next morning was also excellent and the final nice touch was a complementary bottle of water each for my wife and I as we checked out. Just another little touch that lifts this hotel from the ordinary to the special.
Only slight negative would be that the hotel lies in an area that I felt had a slightly edgy feel about it and certainly wouldn't feel overly safe if I had to walk the streets around it late at night. But that`s hardly in the control of the hotel!
Would certainly stay in this hotel again if attending anything on the north side of the city.",5,2016,03,29
211,Easter,Stayed here over easter it was brilliant staff very friendly and helpful couldn't do enough for us  the room was great the food was lovely and excellent recommend this place you won't be disappointed it's only about 20 - 30 mins walk away to the spike plus if u are lucky u might get to see gaa match we did donegal v dublin ,5,2016,03,29
211,"great people, great place","Myself and my partner used this place as a base when viewing apartments in the City. Great location, exceptional service and friendliness from Staff , and great experience. Can thoroughly recommend for anyone wanting excellent access to the City.",4,2016,03,29
211,Seriously super hotel and staff :),"Just returned from a two night stay, the service from the initial emails to reservations (Paige) was nothing but outstanding. 
Greeted with warm towels to freshen up, the room was ready although we did not expect it to be as we arrived particularly early. The room was comfortable, clean and had a HUGE bathroom as well as the biggest of beds - all in all really comfortable. We ate in the sideline Bistro both evenings and the food was lovely, the service was in fact some of the best I have experienced with the friendly, knowledgable staff. Full Irish Breakfast was also of great quality and the service again was great.

Although the hotel itself is fabulous I have to say the service offered by EVERY member of staff we came across really made our stay outstanding. Nothing was too much trouble. They are all a credit to Croke Park. The Concierge is such a help again nothing is too much trouble. Just fabulous!

We had  complimentary Prossecco in our room as it was my birthday and a card from the Front of House manager - another small touch that made it perfect.

The Hotel is situated approximately ten minute walk from O'Connell Street, the hop on hop off bus does a shuttle run every morning into the centre.

It was an easy bus journey to the Hotel from the airport and back again. 

I would have no hesitation in recommending this hotel for a short or long stay in Dublin.

Many many thanks:)",5,2016,03,28
211,Fantastic stay,"Stayed here recently for the second time, this stay was with my 3 kids, from the minute we arrived the staff were amazing, from the girls on reception and the concierge to the staff who served us in the bar. The room had 3 large beds and was still extremely spacious and spotlessly clean. The breakfast the next day was delicious and a great choice of food and the free secure parking is an extra bonus. Croke park stadium is just across the road and the tour is great. I will definatly be staying here again",5,2016,03,28
211,"Great Hotel, less than a mile from the centre of Dublin.","We chose Croke Park Hotel due to the location and discount for staying three consecutive nights and we were not disappointed.
The hotel is very clean and modern and the staff were friendly and helpful. 
Our room was exceptionally clean and spacious enough for the three of us. The beds were comfortable and the black out curtains were good (possibly a little too good as we woke up late one morning!). No water in the room but an ice/water machine at the end of the corridor. I couldn't find a jug in the room so ended up buying a water bottle to fill up. Not a massive issue but a possible point to the hotel to add to the rooms?
We sat in the bar area in the evening and found it very comfortable and the drinks were reasonable and comparable to the pubs in Temple Bar.
We used the Sideline Bistro in the morning for breakfast and the selection for both the full Irish and continental breakfasts was great and the atmosphere was very relaxed and the staff were very helpful and efficient.
Overall, I would definitely visit again as it was a 20 minute walk into the centre or 5/10 minutes by bus (No.40 runs 5 mins walk from the hotel), we had a very relaxing mini break and the hotel had a lot to do with that!",5,2016,03,28
211,Great Hotel,"We stayed here for a weekend break based on reviews, we were not disappointed with the hotel at all.

Pros:
Modern look
Very Clean
Large room size
Quiet air-con and room in general
Really comfy large bed

Cons:
Distance from city centre was quite considerable (30m walk)
Room overlooked the train tracks, horrible and noisy!
CD player and TV were very dated, not even HD...

We would consider staying here again if we got a really good deal, but the distance from the city was a big factor for us. We both love to walk but 30m each way eats into a lot of time that could have been spent exploring the city, also really not a nice area to be walking in.",5,2016,03,27
211,Dublin hospitality,"If you don't mind a short walk or cab ride, this hotel was very nice for a visit to Dublin.  It is directly across from the Croke Park stadium.  The hotel was clean and the concierge, Krishna was especially helpful. We felt like he was really looking out for us.  The bar/restaurant has a huge screen tv, we which we enjoyed for watching a rugby game and a quick meal.",5,2016,03,27
211,Nice hotel with secure parking,"My husband and I stayed here to attend the eirtakon convention in croke park stadium. It was a special occasion for us as our daughter was also staying there as she was on the organising convention committee ....we stayed on the executive floor, our room was overlooking the entrance to croke park, which was lovely as we could watch the crowds coming and going. Continental  breakfast is included in the rate in the executive  lounge....we did not use that facility this time but have in the past and is was good......
Check in was very busy, with lots of young people, in costumes, (obviously attending the eirtakon convention) standing and sitting in the foyer and check in area. However, the female staff member who checked us in was totally disinterested ...we commented to her how busy it was and she just agreed...I had expected she would mention the reason why ....I explained to her that I had injured my back whilst travelling and was in considerable pain (I was hardly able to walk) but she didn't even offer help with our luggage!!!!prior to booking I had contacted  the hotel to check on bed sizes.....we need a 5ft wide bed at a minimum and we're assured our room would have that, however, the double bed was actually a regular double  (4ft6ins), thankfully there was a single bed also in the room though this meant we slept in separate beds...not acceptable normally but as I had extreme back pain turned out OK as I needed the bed to myself.
The room was clean and comfortable but on the small size for an executive room, (smaller than our previous visit).....the shower was good. On my return I followed up with the manager who kindly offered us a complimentary stay on our next visit...which was a pleasant surprise.",4,2016,03,27
211,Lovely hotel really good staff,Really enjoyed our stay. Staff were very friendly and very efficient. The room was excellent very comfortable and e found the use of the executive lounge was extremely useful as this was a family trip,5,2016,03,27
211,Family stay in the Croke park hotel..Excellant stay👍.,"Our family of 2adults&3kids stayed in the Croke park hotel Dublin during the wk for 1night..it was just fab,fab hotel from start to finish.From the room,food,people working there all very nice.We will be back for sure.We also did the Croke park museum&park tour all good..5💥💥💥💥💥all around..",5,2016,03,27
211,Lovely hotel,"We only stayed at this hotel for one night but the experience was incredible. On arrival, we were given a free bottle of water and a hot hand towel to refresh. The staff at the desk were very helpful and pleasant. The room we stayed in was huge with a balcony overlooking Croke Park. The bathroom was also very big with a separate bath and shower. The room was very quiet and clean and the massive bed was extremely comfortable! The hotel is a bit out of the way from the city centre sights and the locals we walked past advised us to put our cameras away as we walked into the city. The staff at the hotel, however are happy to ring a taxi for you if you so wish. We would love to visit this hotel again if we return to Dublin.",5,2016,03,27
211,Super stay!,"Visited Dublin with friends wanted a good hotel and found it!
Welcome was excellent, as was our first impressions.
Our room was superb, spotlessly clean, great linen great bathroom. 
Our only problem was a bit of disturbance from the room next door, dealt with by reception satisfactorily.
We had a fantastic evening watching rugby, great sandwiches etc well presented and generous!",5,2016,03,26
211,Excellent hotel - highly recommended,"You don't have to be a fan of the funny Irish sports that they play in the mega-stadium close by to enjoy the hotel. We had a wonderful stay in a family room for four nights. The staff is competent and friendly, the breakfast is ""full Irish"", and the rooms are clean and large. Free wifi with high speed. We were a little conserned that the hotel is not   in the city center, but it really was no problem. A taxi is around €10 and they are plentiful. Or you can walk some 600 meters to a frequently-served bus stop. But we ended up walking to the center. It's a nice walk in friendly neighborhoods. And of course - Dublin is city well worth visiting!",5,2016,03,26
211,Very nice hotel,"Enjoyed our stay at this hotel. Staff was very nice and the rooms were clean and equipped with everything we needed. Every day we would come back from our Dublin adventures our room would be clean and tidy. We bought tickets to a Dublin bus tour in lobby from a very nice man, and the bathrooms in lobby were so nice with towel hand-cloths. It's in an ""ok"" area. Right across from stadium but a €10 uber/taxi ride to centre. I would recommend staying here and eating at their bistro downstairs. ",5,2016,03,25
211,Great Hotel,"My husband and I spent two nights here on our recent Dublin visit. Our room was beautiful and spacious and the staff were all very helpful. The hotel is a little away from the main attractions of town, but not too bad a walk.",5,2016,03,25
211,"Nice comfortable, friendly hotel","Very comfortable hotel with lovely modern rooms. hotel communal areas such as bar, restaurant etc also very good. Hotel is about 15 minute walk to the centre of town and probably about 30-45 min walk to Temple Bar area. There are also plenty of taxis around for about 10-11 euros to Temple Bar. It also has a free secure car park and good gym facilities. Very friendly helpful staff and nice little touches like offering you free bottled water for your onward journey.",4,2016,03,25
211,Very clean and friendly staff,"The Croke Park hotel is located right across the street from the croke park so if you are going to a game it is the perfect location for you. If not, it is a short cab ride to other local spots. The hotel was very clean, the staff was friendly, and I would definitely stay here again and recommended it to anyone. The breakfast buffet had many choices and was delicious. The bar area was open late if you wanted a drink or a place to relax before heading up to your room. The rooms were very clean and the bathrooms looked up to date and very clean. Overall, it was a wonderful experience.",5,2016,03,25
211,Comfortable Hotel and friendly staff,"We chose to stay in the hotel due to proximity to airport and because it was within walking distance of the city centre. The rooms are very clean, staff are friendly and efficient. Shuttle bus in the morning to the city centre is a nice touch. We got a taxi in the evening to go into town as it was cold, ordered by the concierge and arrived within 5 minutes.  The breakfast selection was very good and staff cheerful and attentive. The only slightly negative experience we had was in the bar in the evening due to the presence of small children which spoiled the ambiance.",4,2016,03,25
211,Amazing luxurious hotel with incredible staff,"A group of us stayed here in March for the business management games. From the moment we entered into reception to the moment we left we could not fault anything. The receptionists were very friendly and welcoming. The rooms were spacious, well decorated and had extremely comfy beds. All the staff we met including managers, restaurant and bar staff were all really friendly,  accomodating and looked happy to be at work. A special mention needs to be given to Pawel in the restaurant whos always smiling and Antony/Antoine in the bar (cant remeber exact name) who went out of their way to cater for our needs and also took the time to have a conversation.  The food here is incredible. Compliments to the chef on the presentation and knowledge of good flavours. ( Quinoa salad is amazing!!) I also liked the way porridge was ordered fresh in the morning with a choice of dryed fruits and nuts to add to it. I would suggest adding cinamon to the range. The conference rooms are also amazing and we were well looked after with a never ending water, tea/coffee and biscuit supply. All of us work in hotels and we all agreed that this hotel was inspiring and had an excellent team in place. We will be reccomending our guests to book in to the Croke Park when travelling to Dublin from Kerry, Cork and Tipperary. Thank you again to all for making our stay so perfect and well done to all. ",5,2016,03,25
211,Best hotel I have seen in a long time,"The only way to describe our stay in the Croke Park Hotel: Most amazing stay in a hotel I have had in a long time.

The staff was extremely friendly and helpfull and we never had the feeling that we are missing anything.
If we needed something like information or a taxi the staff at the reception was really helpfull without any problems at all.
The rooms were clean, comfortable and I really liked the style of them.
The hotel bar was also pretty amazing because the variety of products is just huge and the prices are really good compared to other hotels I have read about.

All in all as mentioned in the title: best hotel I have seen in a long time!",5,2016,03,24
211,Great hotel,"Great hotel with good facilities and fabulous helpful staff. Spent 4 nights there around St Patrick's day and Ireland /Scotland rugby match, good atmosphere in the hotel and in Dublin itself. Rooms spacious and clean with both a single and double bed. Breakfast was buffet style with wide variety of choice in both cold and hot items available. Would definitely stay there again if we return to Dublin. Within 15-20 minute walk from central Dublin or approx €8 taxi journey.",5,2016,03,23
211,Excellent Hotel,"Stayed at The Croke Park Hotel, for 3 nights for the C2C concert. Excellent location, not too far out of town, 5 minutes walk takes you to the bus stop then a short journey into city centre. Taxi was required to the 3 arena. Depending on type of taxi €10-15 each way. A big bus was near €15, but a car was around €10.
On check in, the staff were warm & friendly. Rooms were a good size for 3 people, rooms very warm but there is a air conditioning system in place, which was needed. 
Breakfast had an good choice & staff were constantly replenishing items. My nephews were offered hot chocolate with their breakfast which was a nice extra, I have never came across before.
We ate in the restaurant Sunday afternoon, food was lovely big portions. Not a massive selection, although everyone was able to choose something of the menu.  
Check out was done with ease, and another nice touch we were offered bottled water to take with us. Again I have never came across this. 
Would recommend and will definitely return to The Croke Park Hotel. ",5,2016,03,23
211,A good place to stay in Dublin,"LOCATION:
Pros: easy to find - close to airport (15 min. drive) Hop On Hop Off Bus will pick you up at the front of hotel. Pharmacy is around the corner, Croke Park Stadium across the street. 
Cons: no easy access to public bus system, 15 minute walk to city centre. Returning at night, we walked in the dark, but the neighbourhood is not well lit. Would not walk it alone.  It is an easy flat walk both ways, and lots of quaint pubs to stop in too!

Quietest room we've ever stayed in, great deep soaking tubs, best shower in Ireland (and we drove the whole island).  Comfy beds, tv, internet, everything works top notch. Super clean, love the new carpets too!

SERVICE:
Whatever you need, just ask, and they'll make it happen!  Always friendly and helpful too. Even gave us a bottle of water on check out to take on our travels!! A classy hotel that is not pretentious - staff treats all their guests equally - no judgements whether you show up in a 3 piece suite or track pants and knapsacks!!  

BREAKFAST:
Worth adding to your reservation, after breakfast we don't even think of food for the rest of the day!  Generous with large pots of coffee (we Canadians love our coffee) at the tables too!

211,Brilliant 21st Birthday/St Patrick's celebrations!,"We were in Dublin for a short 2 night stay celebrating my friends 21st birthday which just so happens to fall on St Patrick's day. As expected the hotel was very busy, with a rugby match on at croke park that day and st Patrick's day tourists all flooding in! Check in was very smooth and quick considering the hectic lobby area! Our triple room (one single and one double bed) was absolutely perfect; Spotlessly clean and tidy, a nice size and ample facilities plus lovely complimentary toiletries from 'the white company'! Our friend whose birthday it was had complimentary prosecco in her room too which was a lovely touch! We didn't eat at the hotel during our stay as we spent as much time as possible out exploring the city, but found the bar was lovely for a drink. All the staff we came across were very helpful and friendly! Couldn't have asked for more really! I will definitely be back if I'm ever in Dublin again! Thank you for a lovely stay! ",5,2016,03,21
211,The perfect stay,"On arrival at reception which was fairly busy we were still greeted with courtesy and a smile
Once we were checked in the staff and I mean all of them could not do enough for us
Whilst our room was been readied we went for small snack in bar only to find small snack quite filling and delicious
Once in our room we were delighted with the cleanliness both in smell and appearance
Really cannot fault this hotel in any way.        Thank you
",5,2016,03,21
211,Great location,"Arrived late but got a lovely salad in the bar. 
Breakfast not paid for in the corporate booking but desk gave a free voucher for breakfast. 
No water in room except mini-bar, but a bottle given on checkout which was a nice touch. 
Nice room, comfy bed, very convenient location for city meetings, with free parking underground. 
Would recommend and stay again. ",4,2016,03,20
211,Best hotel in Ireland!!,Have just returned from staying at the Croke Park Hotel with my husband and two children.From the minute we arrived at the hotel I knew it was going to be a great weekend as all the staff we came into contact couldn't do enough for us.A special thanks to Siobhan for the complimentary wine for celebrating a special birthday.I will most definitely return to this hotel and I would advise anyone who reads a bad review about this hotel to go for it and try it out yourself as you wont be disappointed.,5,2016,03,20
211,PERFECTION !,"From the second we entered, we were treated superbly by the friendly and efficient staff. We ate in the bar and restaurant and both were amazing in their reasonably priced choices. The restaurant and bar staff were attentive and very well trained. The room was very comfy and spacious and spotless. Impressive in every way. I will never stay anywhere else in Dublin.",5,2016,03,20
211,Amazing Hotel,Great hotel with excellent rooms and high quality service. I was visiting with family and I would highly recommend and will certainly stay again. Location was great and I could not find fault with any aspect of the hotel or staff,5,2016,03,20
211,Fabulous hotel,"I had the chance to stay here recently although was very reluctant as I had only visited this hotel on match days at Croke Park . I say reluctant,as on days of big matches , the hotel is always very busy which very acceptable . How wrong I was to have even doubted this establishment!!! It is probably one ,if not , thee best hotels in Dublin .
I am very hard to please when it comes to hotels taking into consideration,staff ,cleanliness hospitality and food .
Well this place gets five stars from me ! There actually was not one thing I could have complained about . Full credit to the management for their staff training as in my opinion they do leave a lasting impression on you - well done ! It's quite a central location too and please visit the little Italian Restaurant just a few mins walk from the hotel on the same side - true authentic Italian style food at very reasonable prices ! All in all I definitely will be back and maybe book in come late summer so I can truly experience the whole Croke Park experience!",5,2016,03,20
211,Excellent stay,"Beautiful hotel just outside Dublin.City..we had a room facing Croke Park much to our sons element. Free parking..just ask reception to.validate ticket. Went down for some cake last night and.icecream for my son. Very busy as there had been two matches in croker plus it was patricks day. So.the host said she would have the cake and icecream brought to our room free of charge. They were brought up withing ten mins so that was good. Also requested more teabags and these by quickly brought up also.
We got a discount going on.the croke park.tour as we were hotel guests.
Only disappointment was breakfast wasnt.included and for €188 for a 1 night stay I feel it should have been. Would stay again.thanks.
Ps hotel is spotless clean amd we got plenty shampoos/shower gel/soaps and.towels",5,2016,03,18
211,Impeccable. You get what you pay for.,"Visiting a friend for a couple of days in Dublin, I looked at B&B in Dublin city centre but so many had comments about noisy nights that I decided to stay a little further away.

I also needed to work during my trip, so a good wifi connection was essential (something else lacking in cheaper accommodation).

The Croke Park ticked all the boxes and was just 20 minutes away from the centre. 

Sooooo glad I paid a little (not that much) more than a noisy B&B with sporadic wifi.",5,2016,03,18
211,Fabulous hotel outside dublin centre ,"Stayed here with a few friends for a birthday treat. Was a little out of the way but just a short bus ride to the centre. Hotel was great very clean, rooms spacious and large. Had a brilliant weekend, the pubs and bars in the area around there are half the price than the centre of Dublin.  ",5,2016,03,17
211,Excellent value and super friendly staff,We loved our 5 night stay at the Croke Park Hotel. It is conveniently located on the north side of Dublin between town centre and the airport.  The neighborhood is safe to walk and only about a 15 minute walk to downtown activities.  The room was spectacular with a very comfortable bed. Very quiet at all times. The availability of the sideline bistro and bar area was also spectacular.  The food was reasonably priced and excellent quality with great portion sizes.  The bar area had a nice television for viewing special sport events.  We stayed on the executive floor with access to the executive lounge with daily continental breakfast and drinks and snacks available at all hours.  This was very nice as well.  We will definitely stay at the Croke Park Hotel again if returning to Dublin.  The staff is very helpful and knowledgable.  The cleaning of the rooms is spectacular as well. A+++ rating from us.  Thank you again for a wonderful stay.,5,2016,03,16
211,Great Stay at the Croke Park,"My sister and I stayed here for a girls' weekend to celebrate her birthday. We got home from touring one day and found Proseco in our room with a birthday note from the manager which was very nice. 

The hotel seems pretty new with nice amenities, very clean, trendy decor. The room was spacious and in good condition. The concierge was helpful in calling restaurants and helping guide us with public transportation or would call a taxi if needed. We did not eat in the restaurant, but had room service one day in the room for breakfast which was nice. 

The hotel is a bit far from the center of town and any restaurants or shops. It is in a pretty residential neighborhood.  Once you figure out the tram and bus system it is manageable. If you aren't just there for a game (the stadium is across the street) you should be ok walking 15 mins or so to get anywhere. Or willing to pay for a cab. We luckily had pretty good weather and enjoyed walking. The location was very convenient to the airport. 

We ate at Peploe's and Fallon & Byrne, I would recommend both. We also went to the Brazen Head one night which is the oldest pub in Dublin, they have live music, it was a really fun atmosphere and had good traditional pub food. I would say a must! 
We also went to Malahide for a day, it's a small fishing town/suburb about a 25 minute commuter train ride out of the city. There's an old castle there and cute shops. It was just a quaint little village and a nice change from Dublin if you don't have a ton of time to tour the rest of the country, Malahide is a good option. Gibney & Sons is the local pub in town with delicious fish n' chips. 

Overall we had a great stay and positive experience at the Croke Park and would highly recommend it!",5,2016,03,16
211,Excellent from beginning to end,Highly recommend for young and old. Staff are all excellent nothing was a problem. Rooms and bathrooms were spotless. Breakfast was excellent. It was our first stay and we would have no hesitation staying again.,5,2016,03,15
211,"Excellent quality, value and staff","I was very happy with excellent hotel with polite and helpful staff. The hotel was beautifully appointed and spotlessly clean.
We had a choice of restaurant or pub grub and atmosphere was relaxed and friendly.
I would highly recommend it for a base to explore the capital!",5,2016,03,15
211,Croke Park Game or Tour a Must,"If you are visiting  Dublin right now try and take in a Football or Hurling Game in Croke Park.  The Stadium holds about 82,500 but at this time of the year the National League is running (April to end May) and tickets are available for games held in the stadium from most local shops in the city.  It won't be a full stadium but the craic will be great just the same.   The Croke Park Tour is super and include a walk of the stadium and museum but nothing beats attending a game.",5,2016,03,15
211,Family stay at croke park hotel,"Excellent facilities, room  presentation first class. Big Bathroom, extra largeshower, warm facecloths on arrival . Restaurant menus very well priced and excellent service . food was really good. highly recommend to a family who may also wish to visit croke park and take it all in.!!
",5,2016,03,15
211,"Very good, nice location","The hotel is about a 10 min walk from the centre which is perfect if like us you wanted the excitement of town but to relax in peace afterwards. As a large group of 12, we were happy with our rooms (1 single and 1 double) the room was lovely and warm and the blackout curtains were brilliant allowing us to have lie ins both mornings. Would certainly stay again ",5,2016,03,14
211,Brilliant,Spent a fantastic night this hotel the staff were fantastic from the lady who checked us in to the very chatty concierge very modern and very clean reception upon arrival our room wasn't ready so we left the bags and went into town on our return a very quick check in and up to our room for the night all I can say is whoa the landing was beautiful and as g or our room I can't fault it with both a bath and shower great selection of tea and my favourite fruit tea a great touch lovely selection of toiletries great view of croke park stadium very comfortable beds only flaw pillow too soft but thats my own personal preference I was going to the 3 arena and asked the receptionist to call me a taxi was very quick arriving got back around 10 music playing in the bar but went up to bed had a great night sleep when we checked out a lovely man Philip gave us all a bottle of water for traveling and I had a few questions about a future stay when were answered  Philip is a real credit to this hotel as were all staff members we had any interaction with from the lovely cleaner who sorted out the air conditioning to the lafy that gave extra milk and coffee and sugar looking forward to my next stay ,5,2016,03,14
211,Great Hotel,I would definitely recommend this hotel and so would the 11 other members of the  group who stayed here. The hotel was very modern and clean with comfortable beds and lovely bathrooms. The location was fine for us as we didn't mind the walk into the centre and it was a short taxi ride in the evening. The staff were friendly and helpful. I couldn't fault it!,5,2016,03,14
211,Large modern room and bathroom,"I was pleased by the size of the room and the bathroom. I can't remember the last time I've had both a tub and a walk-in shower at a hotel. While I never take a bath, it was a nice feature. Both spaces were very bright with ample fixtures to adjust.

Without any mention whatsoever, the staff sent sparkling wine to my room for my birthday which was earlier in the week. I suppose they noticed from my passport? This was totally unexpected and a very nice surprise. The 5 star hotels in London which I had stayed in on my actual birthday did and said absolutely nothing.

The room service was also good, the strip steak was very flavorful and the fries were better than most back home in the States.",5,2016,03,14
211,ireland v italy rugby,"This is the first time my wife and I have stayed in The Croke Park and it will not be the last.
We had a wonderful time and would not hesitate in giving the hotel a first class recommendation.The hotel has easy access from the airport and car parking is under the hotel.",5,2016,03,14
211,excellent meal and service,"We had dinner in the restaurant.  The crab starter was delicious.  This was followed by equally tasty lamb, chicken and hake main courses. Baileys and white chocolate  cheesecake wrapped up a beautiful meal.  special thanks to Sabrina, Rooma and Mateja for looking after us so well",5,2016,03,14
211,I love this hotel!,"For the price, this hotel offers outstanding amenities and service. It is quiet (unless their is a match across the street in Croke Park Stadium) and clean and modern. We slept well, ate well, and had help from the staff for our first few days in Dublin. It is a convenient location because it is close to the airport, yet you can still walk into the city center.",5,2016,03,13
211,Very good couple of nights.,"Staff very good. Bar area better than most hotels and service/ food good.
Rooms quiet, large and cleanliness you'd expect.
You can easily walk into town in 30 mins during day but need to get a cab at night, which is around 10 euros. This is one downside to location.
Overall good value.",4,2016,03,13
211,Excellent,"A very good midweek stay, 8 to 11 March. Efficient service from friendly and helpful staff. Large room on first floor looking onto inner courtyard. Very quiet, plenty space, comfortable bed, clean bathroom with separate shower and bathroom, slept like logs.
Good variety of breakfast menu, loved the soda bread and big, fresh honeycomb. All made even better by my request for poached eggs, cooked with a smile and to perfection by  the young chef. Look forward to our return.",5,2016,03,12
211,Average ,"Overall a very average experience. 
Location is poor looking out at rubbish filled canal. A good 20-30 mins walk to the Spire on O Connell street. 
Rooms are just ok and noise levels are extreme to say the least. 
Most definitely not 4* standard , probably a 2* at best. 
Wouldn't imagine we will visit again. 
Had a few issues while we stayed , they were sorted out with an apology and a free drink , I suspect there are a lot of free drink vouchers handed out ! 
For the record giving someone a free drink doesn't resolve problems ! 
3/10. 
Overpriced , stereotypical of what's wrong about Ireland , overpriced , overvalued product. 
",3,2016,03,12
211,Highly recommended ,"We have just returned following a 4 day stay. The hotel 'ticks all the boxes' as far as our party of nine were concerned. Good accommodation, convenient location (approx 20min walk to O'Connell Street) and excellent staff. The waiters and waitresses are really attentive without being obtrusive. We would definitely recommend a stay a The Croke Park hotel.",5,2016,03,11
211,Too many small issues,"We stayed here recently (4th & 5th March 2016). We had booked a special ,advertised on the hotels own website. It was two nights b&b with 1 evening meal and upgrade of room (on availability). We arrived on Friday afternoon and got checked in by a very friendly member of staff complete with hot towel???
We were given room 255 which was a lovely room albeit, not an upgraded room, when we enquired about the upgrade we were told, on availability only.....fair enough, would like to know the stats on how many of these deals offered the upgraded room, purely curiosity. 
Nonetheless the room was adequate and the staff had even left a couple of small bottles of prosciutto and a card wishing us happy anniversary. 
We ate in the bar on Friday afternoon and it was spot on, good enough food for the price, no complaints. We then went out for the evening and left the AC on in the room, looking forward to getting back to a nice cosy room. Unfortunately the AC wasn't working and we didn't realise  until we arrived back in, from our evening out. The room was fairly cool. We rang down to reception and they immediately sent someone us who confirmed the AC wasn't working, we requested a heater which he brought up for us and this just about done for the night, it proved to be an uncomfortable nights sleep as there was no way to regulate the heat on the small plug in heater, so eventually when the room warmed up we turned off the heater which meant the room was cold during the night and in the morning.....especially getting out of the shower in the morning,brrrrhhhhh !!!!!
The following day the staff offered to move us to another room, which we were delighted to hear. Unfortunately the room we were offered was a good bit smaller with only 1 small double in it, we requested a further move which turned out to be a lovely room on the 3 rd floor with a full size bed in it. We were delighted. We went to the bar to grab some late lunch before going for an afternoon nap to catch up on the previous nights lost sleep, unfortunately the bar doesn't serve food on match days!.So we headed off to bed. This turned out to be a bit of a nightmare, the noise was unbelievable, like something you would experience on a cheap summer holiday, doors banging, people shouting, kids shouting and screaming. This coupled with overhead noise, we can only assume there is a public usage room directly above the room we stayed in,just made the afternoon a disaster.We didn't bother to ring down to reception as we felt it might just be construed that we were just moaning about everything . 
We ate in the restaurant on Sat evening , which was lovely, staff were very attentive and the food was excellent.
On check out, I hi lighted all of the above,with out being prompted (""how was your stay""- I would have thought this was standard in hotels now, seems not here) which I felt fell on deaf ears, we had paid up front on arrival for our stay. In hindsight, I wont be doing that again, as if I was in the same position again I would be refusing to pay for the first night. 
So overall , we were very disappointed, it was a special occasion, our wedding anniversary and a concert. The Croke Park Hotel , let us down and we would be reluctant to recommend or visit again. There were just too many small things that made our stay an unhappy one.
To finish on a positive note, the staff and the food was excellent",3,2016,03,11
211,Great Hotel,"The area is not so great but this hotel is. We did have a slight issue on arrival but this was promptly addressed by Catherine and her team to our satisfaction.
We were celebrating our 30th wedding anniversary and our friends were celebrating their 40th. From the moment we arrived we were made most welcome by all the staff we came into contact with.. The rooms were very comfortable, the beds sumptuous. we ate in the Bistro twice and the food was excellent, as was the service from Helen, Sabrina and the others. We used our complimentary drinks vouchers for evening cocktails and had a nice surprise of prosecco and chocolates in our rooms to celebrate the occasions.
Breakfast was excellent and well organised. We had executive rooms on the 4th floor which gave us use of the lounge.
Concierge was great and helped us to decide what to do in town.
Dont let the area put you off, or the stadium next door. We didn't hear any noise even though matches were being played.
definitely recommend and would definitely use this hotel again.",5,2016,03,10
211,Beautiful Hotel and Amazing Stay!,"Stayed at this gorgeous hotel over valentines weekend this year. Upon arrival we were greeted with hot flannels and heart shaped chocolates - a nice little touch! Not sure if this was just for valentines or if this is standard? We got upgraded to the Executive Floor on 4, due to the way we had made the booking. This meant we had access to the Executive Lounge - free tea, coffee, bottles of water and juice and snacks accessible all day. This also meant we had a free continental all you can eat style breakfast each morning! The added bonus was a complimentary drink in the bar each night - so I would definitely recommend going Exec!!

The rooms were perfect; comfortable and quiet. Dressing gowns and slippers made our last night in particular a wonderful experience - room service was impeccable and a nice end to a wonderful weekend in lovely Dublin!

Staff were so helpful and nothing was too much trouble for anyone. We felt very welcome! Rooms were clean, food was delicious and drinks were tasty and not overpriced :)

The ONLY thing I will say, the area is not the nicest and wouldn't recommend walking home from the town. However a cab will only set you back 6 euro from O'Connell Street (the main hub other than Temple Bar!) and the concierge will set you up with a free shuttle bus to town if you buy the 'hop on hop off' bus tour with them - a steal at 20 euro for two days. We loved how helpful the concierge was and he recommended a few decent places to eat and drink too!

Would definitely recommend, and would stay here again in the future! Thank you for a wonderful stay!",5,2016,03,10
211,Excellent and friendly,This was one of the most friendliest hotels I have stopped in. The staff were attentive and obliging. The hotel itself was very clean and prices reasonable. An excellent base to visit Dublin all be it a good walk into the centre.,5,2016,03,10
211,Business stay,"Had to attend a conference in Croke Park so this hotel is ideally suited. Literally 20 metres from Croke Park.
The hotel has a secure underground Carpark, which is free for residents. Must be one of a few hotels that don't charge for the Carpark. 
Found all the staff to be courteous and polite.
The hotel was really nicely decorated all the way through, the rooms were large and spacious. The tv in the bedroom even had sky sports. 
They do a good lunch deal for €10 soup and sandwich.
I had beer batter fish and chips for my evening meal, it really was the nicest beer batter fish that I had in ages.
Breakfast was very good with a good selection of continental and hot food.
On checkout they gave a complimentary bottle of water.
Found it reasonably priced for a 2 night stay in Dublin.",5,2016,03,09
211,Everything was wonderful,"Every aspect of our stay at Croke Park was fantastic, from the friendly greeting as we checked in complete with warm towels, which was very welcome after the unexpected snow, to every member of staff we dealt with. Our room was lovely with a wonderfully comfy and large bed. The bathroom was large with lovely white company products. As part of our package we received complimentary drinks at the hotel bar each night which added to our experience. We ate in the bar and again the food was great as well as the atmosphere, relaxing on the sofas in front of the fire. The breakfast was also really nice with lots of options and constantly restocked. We stayed on the 4th floor meaning we had access to the executive lounge another bonus to this hotel, here we had constant access to hot drinks, water, juice as well as breakfast and snacks.
Every single member of staff was smiley and friendly taking the time to say good morning/ afternoon, something I rarely encounter in hotels.
Our stay was topped off by a complimentary bottle of prosecco being delivered to our room on our first night to celebrate our anniversary, such a lovely gesture.
I would definitely recommend this hotel and if I return to Dublin would stay here.
Thank you for making our trip fantastic.",5,2016,03,09
211,Lovely hotel,"I recently visited the croke park hotel on March 4th-6th. I booked through travel republic as a Christmas gift for my boyfriend and was a bit dubious as to why such a fantastic looking hotel was so fairly priced. We were not disappointed! The breakfast was fab and with it being buffet style it ensured that we had a belly full before heading out. Staff were efficient, professional and friendly. Taxi's turned up within minutes to the hotel after the concierge had made the call. We were also notified by the hotel that there were match days on the Saturday/Sunday, and if we required a meal at the restaurant to book in advance due to it being busy. This was not an issue for us as we ate in the centre on the nights.

The only slight downside to the hotel for us was its distance away from O'Connel street and the temple bar area. We used taxis all weekend and they can vary massively in price as to which area you are picked up in. However, as it happens I wasn't too well and with it being a distance away from all the hustle and bustle, I was actually thankful of the peace and quiet.

I would highly recommend this hotel and I'm hoping to visit again very soon.",5,2016,03,08
211,stay at the Croke,Staff were very Welcoming friendly and polite. We received great service. The room was Clean and comfortable although the bed was a bit uncomfortable. There was an extensive selection for breakfast of both hot and cold food.Would definitely  stay again.,5,2016,03,08
211,Excellent hotel and service however the seating and decor in the bar area lets this place down with a bang,"This is a fabulous hotel and by and large one of the best business hotels that I have stayed in when in Ireland. As a 4* hotel, I expected the decor, ambiance and most importantly basic seating to be up to 4* standard.  Unfortunately, this is not the case. I give this hotel a massive 9/10 for practically everything but a 3/10 for the seating comfort. Small complaint on the scheme of things, but why do everything else right and get one of the basics wrong?! 

Great customer service too btw... 👍",4,2016,03,08
211,Awesome,"The room was big and very clean. The food we ordered from the restaurant was excellent. Especially the seafood chowder. It was about 30 min walk from the city center and 12 min by taxi from the airport. The only dislike is the location, as I would not walk in by night as also told by the inhabitants. However a taxi costs from the center approximately 10euros. It was one the best hotels I stayed in, very posh and friendly. ",5,2016,03,08
211,Weekend Away,"Just back from an enjoyable 2 night break in The Croke Park Hotel. I found the staff to be superb.. Check in was very quick and efficient but yet personable. The girl that served us at breakfast, called Jessica was so pleasant and obliging, it was a pleasure to deal with her. There is obviously is a lot of well spent time allotted to staff traing and customer service and the results are obvious. We had paid extra for an upgraded room. While the room was spacious with a nice bathroom, I wasn't happy with the way the door opened straight into the room, with no corridor at the entrance. This meant every sound could be heard from the hallway from our bed. Also it wasn't very private. Other rooms on this floor didn't seem to have this problem so if I was booking again I would avoid this room. 
The food at breakfast was standard fare but I found the selection of fresh fruit on offer to be pretty basic. 
The location of this hotel is great for the city centre + again the front desk were able to organise taxis for us very quickly. 
This was my second visit to this hotel and I look forward to returning but I will be more specific when booking the room. ",4,2016,03,08
211,No hassle stay,"The room was spacious, spotless, and very comfortable. The staff were friendly and efficient. Overall I had a very good experience in the Croke Park Hotel. I will definitely stay there again when on business on that side of Dublin.",5,2016,03,08
211,Perfect,"Had a great night here, perfect location, very friendly staff and the little things they done for us were great, the food was unbelievable, would recommend this hotel to everyone :-) will defiantly be returning :-)",5,2016,03,07
211,Crome park hotel,"As always an excellent hotel to stay in. Staff lovely, room immaculate, facilities lovely, best mattress I have ever slept on! Quiet corridors at night. Breakfast excellent. Proximity to city centre is fine. Super venue for 3arenaconcerts . Only downfall is walking back to hotel at night-not very safe so take a taxi. I always check for availability whenever I visit Dublin. Have stayed in family room also with children-always guaranteed an enjoyable, relaxed time. Breakfast is excellent-chef ready to cook almost anything for you! Top class hotel.",5,2016,03,06
211,Great Hotel,"Perfect hotel for a long weekend in Dublin. The Croke Park is only an easy 15/20 minutes walk from O'Connell Street. We stayed here for 2 nights while exploring Dublin, staff were really friendly and very happy to help. The room was clean and perfectly equipped for a long weekend stay. ",5,2016,03,06
211,"Ideal location, great hotel","Went to the Croke Park hotel whilst in Dublin on a short break over Valentines day. Amazing hotel, tentative staff who catered to our every need. Fantastic meal within the onsite bistro and the wait staff again were so tentative. We were made to feel very appreciated and will def come here again!",5,2016,03,05
211,Wonderful Service,"My husband and I spent 10 days hiking the Kerry Peninsula and needed a place to stay the night in Dublin before our flight the next day. I wanted something close enough to the airport but not an airport hotel. This location fit the for our needs. We checked in and got an instant upgrade, so our room was amazing! I have stayed in many hotels, but this one was above and beyond any place I have stayed, I only wish we could have stayed more than one night in this amazing suite.",5,2016,03,03
211,Good business hotel,"Was here to attend an exhibition in the Croke Park stadium across the road. The hot towels at reception on check in are an interesting if not unusual touch. Bedrooms are a good size, comfortable King size bed with good size bathroom. Wifi is excellent and free. A welcome fruit bowl and two bottles of water all auger well for a hotel which caters for the business traveller",4,2016,03,02
211,birthday/engagement amazing service,Myself and my boyfriend arrived to the hotel around 9pm. check in was so efficient. upon arriving to our room we were greeted with prosecco and a lovely card with birthday wishes for me. W e later asked reception to call us a taxi as we were going to a bar in the city- again so efficient. My boyfriend proposed to me in Dublin that night which was all very exciting and of course I was telling everyone including the staff on reception when we returned to the hotel.  Around 20 minutes later a member of staff delivered more prosecco and a beautiful tray of fruit. to our room this lovely gesture made this amazing night a little bit more special.,5,2016,03,02
211,"Amazing hotel, bad area! ","I could have given this hotel 4 stars as the area that the hotel is in is not pleasant. It is located in drumcondra and the walk to the city centre is about 15 minutes. The streets close by are dirty, there are also a few homeless people about and other dodgy characters! We never walked back at night or in the dark as we felt it was too risky. A taxi from the city centre back was 10 euro. That however is the only negative thing that I have to say. The hotel is amazing and the area would not put me off returning. The staff are fantastic, so friendly and helpful. Quick check in, arrived early, 10am or so and a room was ready straight away! Hot towels were also provided aswell as water if we needed some. The reception have a dedicated person to see to all your needs! If you need a taxi, bus route, map this is the place to be! So helpful and useful if it's a first time to a big city! The rooms are lovely, spacious with comfy beds and good condiments available. Big bathrooms also. Didn't eat at the hotel but I'm sure the food would be lovely, the standard of everything is so high! I would consider adding on breakfast if I was to stay again. At first I thought the price was steep but when the price is pretty similar in Dublin centre and it's right there when u wake up it is definitely worth it so you don't have to wander about looking for food. We also caught the air coach from the airport, 10euro each return! Really worth doing, every 15 mins and the drop off point is a 5-10 min walk from the hotel. I really recommend this hotel for a Dublin stay!! ",5,2016,03,01
211,Fantastic in everyway,"I don't ever write reviews but this is one of the best hotels I have ever stayed in, everyone is extremely friendly and helpful, the hotel is spotless and the location is a 10 minute walk to the city centre of Dublin",5,2016,03,01
211,Great value stay in a beautiful hotel,"Booked in over the last weekend in February.  Discovered there was a game on at Croke Park and asked to be placed in a quiet room for our anniversary stay.  This was provided along with a couple of bottles of prosecco.  Helpful and friendly reception staff, really comfortable rooms and only a 15 min walk to the river and the Centre of the city. Wifi worked great and facilities all good.",5,2016,03,01
211,Gorgeous,"Myself & Husband stayed about 3 weeks ago and it was a lovely experience, a really great hotel.  The bar was so welcoming and cosy we didn't bother going elsewhere for a drink.  Very good service from all the staff we encountered.  We only stayed 1 night but I'd definitely go again, and for longer,",5,2016,03,01
211,Clean and friendly hotel.,"The hotel was very clean and the staff were very friendly.  The food in the restaurant and bar was presented nicely and was good quality, although there could have been a little more choice.  It was about a twenty minute walk into the city centre from the hotel.",5,2016,02,29
211,weekend break,"Had the pleasure of staying at the Croke Park hotel and had an amazing weekend with my daughter, fantastic room, comfortable, spacious and very clean. Food choices really good in the bar, fantastic breakfast & great value for money.  15 minute walk from main shopping area, but worth the walk for the value & comfort of the hotel facilities and the welcoming staff.  Service in the bar on an evening was slow and this was the only downside to the stay, however the food is amazing and huge portions.  The cocktails are lovely.",5,2016,02,29
211,Brilliant,"So far this is the best hotel I've ever stayed in in Dublin for many reasons
1) Overall appearance of public area is super - its lovely, very clean with no signs of wear on walls/carpets where you would expect
2)Check in staff and those serving breakfast were wonderful. Can't praise them highly enough
3) Breakfast...not one negative thing to say, just perfect
4)Bedroom, very clean. Lovely bed, great facilities (used the iron and trouser press, kettle and CD player), lovely bathroom with The White Company toiletries...really nice! Bonus TV that actually worked properly (i.e. rte 1=1 and so on.

We will definitely be back, and recommend to anyone we speak to looking for a hotel in Dublin. Just a shame I can't stay here for Bruce :( 
Well done Croke Park Hotel and Staff, super impressed!",5,2016,02,29
211,Very good stay,It was a good choice. Location is good. very good WIFI connection and speed. definitely I recommend it and i will visit it again.  About 20 minutes walking distance to the Oconnel street and the city center. ,5,2016,02,29
211,Excellent Accommodation,"On arriving the staff were very helpful and friendly. On checking in was very swift and receptionist was very helpful and had a wonder personality. The Hotel was spotless, rooms comfortable and service was second to none.
Overall I would highly recommend the Croke Park Hotel for all the right reasons but also for it locality.",5,2016,02,29
211,Such a lovely experience!,"Me and my partner visited this hotel for a long weekend and having read several reviews on here, we had high expectations and the hotel didn't disappoint. The staff were attentive and friendly, anything you needed, they were willing to do this for you. The room we stayed in (a deluxe room) was really lovely, the bed was so comfortable, we struggled to get out of it in the morning! The room was cleaned every single day (including Sunday) which we didn't expect and we were constantly provided with fresh towels, could request for the sheets to be changed if we wanted to, etc. The hotel's Bistro restaurant was worth every penny, we didn't find it expensive at all, we thought it compared to the prices you'd pay in the UK and the food couldn't be faulted (If you're going to eat in the hotel, you must try the Baileys Cheesecake!) The hotel was a slight walk from the city centre, however we usually got taxi's and they cost about 10 euros per trip, which we had budgeted for after reading reviews anyway and the hotel taxi fare cost 20 euros. We would definitely return in future, we had a great weekend.",5,2016,02,26
211,Very good hotel indeed,"I had a too-brief business stay here; it was excellent despite an unsalubrious location. The staff were incredibly helpful. I was able to leave my car free of charge for the day, after checking out. No charge for extra coffee for a colleague who joined me for an early meeting. The room was lovely. White Company toiletries were very nice. It also has a decent small gym which as far as I could see is not mentioned on the website. The bar food menu is a bit limited with no pasta - mostly sandwiches, salads and the usual burgers. But i had a really good fish chowder. Breakfast was fine- freshly made toast which was much nicer than the usual DIY stuff. Overall would have liked to spend longer.",4,2016,02,24
211,Well worth a visit.,"I stayed at The Croke Park during February 2016 while on business in Dublin. 
The hotel is centrally located, within walking distance of the city centre & is directly across the street from Ireland's premier stadium.
There is ample parking in the underground car park and check in was efficient and hassle free. The staff were extremely friendly & were happy to go the extra mile for their guests. The rooms were well appointed with tea/coffee, air conditioning, flatscreen tv, music center & large comfortable beds. The ensuite bathroom was of a good standard with both bath and separate shower and it was well stocked with towels, toiletries etc.
The only complaint I had was the WIFI signal in my room which kept crashing.
I opted for bar food in the Sideline Bar downstairs & again, the quality on offer was good and reasonably priced.
Breakfast was good too and I would have no hesitation in recommending this hotel.",4,2016,02,24
211,I would give it 10 stars if it was possible,"My husband and I stayed here from the 20th of Feb 2016 to the 24th of Feb 2016. We are so pleased we did.This is such a fantastic hotel. 

We booked through Expedia and chose the upgrade option; for an extra 10 euros a night.

The upgrade gave us a king size room; on the top floor. Continental breakfast and access to the executive lounge. Well worth the little extra it cost.
As access to the lounge meant hot and colds drinks. Fruit and snacks; anytime of the day/night.
Breakfast was also provided in here. To save having to go downstairs. Which was lovely.

I contacted the hotel a few weeks before arriving. To let them know; We were celebrating our 8th wedding anniversary, during our stay. 
I also requested a room on the end of a corridor. So we would only have one neighbour. 

Our room was on the end of a corridor. Away from the lifts on the top floor. In other words all of my requests had been granted. Awesome!

The reception staff were very helpful and friendly. The decor was beautiful. 

After check in we went to our room. In the room were two bottles of prosecco and an anniversary card. Such a lovely touch. 

We had also been given 4 drinks vouchers. Which was the equivalent of four drinks each from the bar. Again so thoughtful.

The room was so luxurious. The bed was extremely comfortable. The wifi was fast. Everywhere was extremely clean. The bathroom had a proper full size shower. As well as a bath. 

Certainly no expense spared. No plastic cups or polycotton here.

Once unpacked we explored the hotel. There was a lovely bar and restaurant on the ground floor. There was also a gym. 

The restaurant/bar staff were fabulous. They could not do enough for us. 
We ate at the bar on the first and fourth evening. The food was delicious. We did think the warm vegetarian options were lacking. However we find that in most places. So not a massive problem.

The hotel is about a 10 minutes drive from the airport. We had a hire car and were pleased to be able to park at the hotel for free. Another great touch.

We thought the hotel was ideally placed. Nice and quiet. 

We would definitely recommend this hotel. It is genuinely one of the best hotels we have ever stayed in.",5,2016,02,24
211,Top quality hotel,"Lovely hotel with fantastic staff.  Good quality furniture, comfortable room with a good choice of TV channels.
Only downside for us was that it was quite a walk to city centre, which we don't mind, but the surrounding area wasn't great to walk through.",4,2016,02,23
211,Fab hotel would recommend! ,"For such a cheap price this hotel is gorgeous inside!! Bit of a rough area and 15 minute walk to town but we didn't care! Staff were lovely and welcoming, even giving us complimentary prossecco for our anniversary! People of Dublin were all very welcoming! Had a great time thanks!! ",5,2016,02,23
211,Long weekend stay,"Chose this hotel due to locality, easy journey into Dublin centre and not too far from airport. Lovely rooms and very comfortable bed. Staff in all areas were lovely and very helpful, especially reception and concierge booked taxi for a 4.30 am journey to airport (which was only €21 !). Ate in bistro one night and food was excellent as was the service. Have recommended this Hotel to my colleagues who have booked for April.",5,2016,02,22
211,If it was 'Four in a Bed'...,"How were your hosts? On arrival I was wished happy birthday by the receptionist and a gratis gift awaited in the room, very nice touch. I had one extra request which was dealt with, with courtesy and speed.
How clean? Easy, spotless! Room was pristine and even the public toilets were perfect. 
How were the facilities? Pretty much fine, loved the fire in the bar. If there was a minor down point, I couldn't work out how to get the radio on (probably my fault), not a problem though because the excellent WiFi let me get it on my phone.
How was the food? Only eat a bar meal but that was top notch, in fact enough to ask for a doggy bag which I requested to be taken to the room. They didn't bat an eyelid and it was perfectly wrapped and boxed, in the room on our return, excellent! 
Would you stay again! Errr, yes!",5,2016,02,22
211,Perfect Stay!! ,"Stayed here while going to a gig in Dublin and it is just perfect. We were able to walk 20mins into Dublin centre and it is a 5 min drive from the 3Arena where our gig was. The rooms are comfortable, high quality and I can not complain. We had a great dinner at the bar and again no complaints it was delicious. I will certainly be back. ",5,2016,02,21
211,My 21st,We arrived at the hotel which was a 10 minute walk away from the main shops and the staff were very welcoming and friendly. Me and my friends stayed here to celebrate my 21st birthday. We got to the room and it was lovely and clean. The staff went the extra mile to make my experience something special by giving me a card and 2 bottles of prosecco. We slept really well as it was quiet and the beds were so comfortable! When we ordered breakfast in the morning through room service they were very polite and helpful. The food came and it was good value for your money as we couldn't eat all of it! We all really enjoyed our stay and would defiantly stay here again. ,5,2016,02,21
211,Nice Service / Average Dining Experience,"My family and I dined at the Croke Park hotel in late January. 

We parked in the underground car park which is convenient and easily accessible. We dined in the sideline bar area. The space is contemporary and clean but perhaps a little bright and lacking in some atmosphere. 

We were greeted upon arrival by nice and friendly staff, there was a number of ladies looking after our table and all were attentive, interested and professional. Our food however although fine was very basic. We ordered a mixture of items from Burgers to Club Sandwiches etc and some children's food. There was a 5minute delay with the delivery of our meals from the time the first dish reached the table to the last dish. This was disappointing but no reflection on the service I believe. 

Our biggest disappointment was the food which was simply underwhelming - nothing special, nothing different in taste, ingredients or presentation. Essentially it was very ordinary pub food which seemed to be at odds to a business positioned as a high end (top-rated) Trip Advisor hotel. For a hotel of this standing and the food price points I would expect something more creative, innovative and dynamic from the dining experience.  

Thank you to our servers who were very pleasant and accommodating. The receptionist were also friendly and kindly validated our tickets for the car park.",3,2016,02,21
211,"Quick to take your money, b****** giving it back","Upon arrival on Monday (08/02/16) after a showery walk to the hotel we were 'greeted' in a false, unenthusiastic welcoming from the receptionist. 

To make our lives easier and intentionally theirs, we showed the woman an already printed out document to show the booking and reservation of the room. 

Unfortunately she must have missed the training on how to read white A4 pieces of paper with black ink as she did not give two flying hoots about it. 

With it being our first holiday experience, when the woman asked for my card I thought this must have been policy or something to do with a ""deposit"" in case of damages made in the rooms. This was not addressed as to why she actually wanted  it and needed the card.
~Again, she must have missed the training session on simple communication and explaining what she was doing behind the counter and reasons for using the card.

To cut a small story short, the woman ended up charging us for the room yet again, not everyday that you want to be charged an additional €250 on your vacation away. Plus not the best of starts to the holiday. 

The room was well presented and ready for our arrival but we were not told about how to use the electrics - to save you all looking dumb going back to reception, you use your key card on the door to turn the electrics on. 

Once downstairs to obviously place in the complaint and question the electrics, the woman that served us before somehow made her quick escape, lucky for her. We were told that yes the woman did accidentally charge us for the room, (*bravo*) and that we were able to have a refund. 

Unfortunately this was not as simple as putting the money back onto my card. They had to speak with management but the manager who suppose to be in the hotel at the time would be in later -- on a side note, when I spoke to the manager today (20/2/16) about the refund, supposedly there is ALWAYS two managers in the hotel, well obviously not and she made me feel really small, as if to say I was lying. 

They said that we can go off and do what we want for the day and they will sort it all out and have the refunded receipt on the bed to prove the transaction. 

Obviously after having a lovely walk into the town -- for those that care, it is roughly a 30 minute walk, to help we crossed 5 traffic lights to get into town and an immense spike (when you see it, you will know what I mean). We went back to our room to see if that said receipt was on the bed (and maybe a complimentary 'sorry' glass of bubbly), to our surprise, well not that much of a surprise, neither of the items were there, so again, back to the wonderful reception desk we went. 

Basically we got the receipt and were told the refund would come in a 'few' days. 

With the scarce amount of money we had to be careful with what we were able to do which slightly jeopardise some of the activities we were able to involve ourselves in Ireland. This did not spoil the fun we had. 

The night before we left, there was still no refund processed or was showing in my bank account. The obvious of asking about how long exactly 'a few days' was in order to process refunds. Since I did not really want to go back home whilst being out of pocket for €250. 

Luckily someone with a bit more sense about this kindly told the both of us that it takes roughly 10 days to be processed and back into the account. 

Today (20/02/2016) I was able to speak with a manager about this scenario and question as to why after more than the 10-days period I have still yet to receive this refund. 

She mentioned that somehow in some miraculous way there were no transactions taken out on my card, I am sorry, but I am not silly enough to go on holiday with a mere 14pence left in my bank account. 

Then I felt really belittled and as if I was lying to her, when I mentioned about how there was no manger to speak to in the hotel - as she was puzzled since supposedly there is meant to be ALWAYS two people ready for these scenarios. As I said previously, we were told there were no current manager to help us with the refund and we could come back later and they would sort it out, which obviously was not the case. Now I have to wait yet another weekend for them to contact me to attempt to sort out this matter -- yes it has STILL not been solved!

Not only am I absolutely livid with the quality of service with the receptionist, but also the quality of friendliness of management and general customer service. I am appalled by the overall outcome from this as it has not be resolved. 

10/10 would not stay again. 

To end this on a high for you all, Ireland is without a doubt a gorgeous city with plenty to do and the locality of the hotel is great if you enjoy sight-seeing and walking. 

The room-service was outstanding and was as if we kept coming into a new room each night.   

I hope if I ever returned there would be some more intense training for all the members of staff and management for these situations.",1,2016,02,20
211,Amazing ,"Good hotel. Good location, a bit far from downtown but easy to walk down. They have amazing breakfast buffet and it's right across the stadium. Lovely lounge nice fireplace and huge projections screen,  good to watch sports. ",5,2016,02,20
211,A modern stylish hotel that makes business travel a pleasure,"There are hotels that are a lot closer to my work place but I prefer to travel further and enjoy where I stay. The quality and standards in the hotel are excellent.  However, what really makes it stand out is the customer service provided by ALL the staff. I cannot name check them all but Peter, Michelle and Janet are excellent.",5,2016,02,20
211,An excellent choice inspite of location,"I wouldn't hesitate to come back to this hotel.
In a nutshell:
The bad bit: Location. It is a good 20 minute walk into the town centre through some unattractive streets. This was only a problem if you wanted to come back during the day (to maybe get changed for dinner) and then go out again. The hotel can call cabs, though and a taxi into town cost between 6 and 10 euros, (depending on time of day I suppose although I was suspicious that there was such a discrepancy between prices!)
There is a hop-on, hop-off bus which calls on a morning to collect guests to take into town. 
The good bits: MANY.
Location is BRILLIANT if you are attending anything at the Croke Park Stadium which is opposite.
Food and Drink extremely good and reasonably priced. I would place the breakfasts at 5*
Lovely rooms with working heating/aircon; beautiful bathroom with bath and separate shower. White Company toiletries. Can't thing of a single thing that the room lacked.
EXTREMELY comfy bed with quality pillows and spares to boot! Had a great night's sleep on each of 3 nights.
Staff all absolutely marvellous. Very friendly and helpful, particularly Krishna the concierge, for whom nothing was too much trouble.",4,2016,02,18
211,Excellent hotel in walking distance of Dublin Center,"Stayed here in December of 2013. The hotel is about a 15 minute walk from the Liffey river and Dublin city center. We were on the 3rd floor. The rooms are clean and modern, with nice bathrooms and large windows. Unfortunately the views are nothing to really write about so most of the time we kept the curtains drawn. The staff was very nice and let us check in early without any fuss. 

The neighborhood was well lit and safe to walk in, and the hotel provided parking. The breakfasts were spectacular. Full buffet breakfast with continental options as well as some more traditional Irish favorites such as black pudding, white pudding, beans, rashers, grilled mushrooms, etc.

The bathrooms in this place are huge and the floor was heated. The only small downside to the whole thing is that the hotel was a bit of a pain to get to by car. It is off of a series of 1 way streets that curve off somewhat randomly so we ended up driving around in circles a bit. Be sure to use navigation or have a map of the area.",5,2016,02,18
211,five stars,"Five stars for a four star hotel, we stayed here for three nights, valentines weekend. The staff are Friendly, smart, and polite. The hotel is clean, spacious and the food excellent. We booked an executive room with a lounge for shared use offering inclusive continental breakfast and light refreshments, Cannot fault the hotel in any way, we had a lovely stay here so would highly recommend the croke park hotel to everyone. Will not hesitate to return to this hotel or another hotel in the Doyle collection.Thankyou for such a great stay, and for leaving me in a position where I cannot complain about a thing.",5,2016,02,18
211,Dublin weekend ,Nice trendy hotel about 10 mins in a taxi to o'connel street or walk up the hill 5 mins and get the number 7/8 bus for 75 cents .great knowledgeable staff ESP the concierge .big beds and great showers in bathroom with good air con although needed turning down in night .would deffo stay here again ,5,2016,02,17
211,Fantastic Hotel,"Stayed in a deluxe  room on the fourth floor. Beautiful room, huge barhroom and as it was my partners birthday, there was two bottles of Prosecco in an ice bucket and a card for her, what a wonderful surprise from the management. In addition to this we were also given vouchers for a free drink each for every evening of our stay. However, 
most impressive of all was that when staying on the fourth floor we had exclusive access to the executive lounge, which not only had beautiful views, but included free  bottled water, fruit juices, fruit tea and coffee and biscuits and was open 24 hours.
In addition to this we were also able to have our continental breakfast in here in a quiet and relaxed atmosphere. What a wonderful facility, unique.
   The staff, whether it be in reception, bar, restaurant and in the executive lounge
were friendly,helpful and courteous and a credit to the hotel.
    We were going to eat out most evenings, however, having dined in the main restaurant the first evening, the meal was superb , we were so impressed, we decided to eat there each evening.
    We can thoroughly recommend this hotel to anyone who may be visiting Dublin in the near future and it is certainly worth paying extra for an upgrade to the fourth floor.
       Alistair & Lesley",5,2016,02,17
211,"Lovely Hotel, Friendly Staff, Good Breakfast","I stayed here with my partner for valentines weekend and I don't think I could find fault with the hotel.

The staff were very friendly and helpful, giving us lots of information about the city and places to visit.  The refreshing towel on arrival was most welcome after being up early and travelling.

The hotel was nicely finished, clean and tidy.  The carpets in the corridors felt new and bouncy. 

The bedroom was no different, nicely finished and clean, the bed was very comfy and big.  The bathroom had a good supply of The White Company Toiletries, had a bath and a shower, which was nice and warm.  

Breakfast was also very good with a wide selection of cooked or cold food to choose from and dishes made to order on request, all of the things we ate were tasty.  We did not eat any other meals in the hotel but enjoyed a selection of cocktails from the bar, all of which again were very good. 

The only negative point would be the area where the hotel is located.  It's a little run down and the view from our room wasn't the most pleasant I've had.  It's opposite the stadium so a good location if you are visiting for sports and it's not that far from the city centre, we walked it once but mostly got a bus or taxi.  

",4,2016,02,17
211,Lovely hotel and staff,"We stayed at the Croke Park Hotel for a long weekend. 
The bedrooms were comfortable and the breakfasts were amazing. We didn't eat in the restaurant but we ordered food in the bar one evening. The bar food was great and the staff were lovely and friendly throughout the hotel. If I could find one fault, it would be the lighting in the bedroom was a little dark. I've raised this with the hotel so hopefully they can look into it. Overall a great place to stay. I'd go back. ",5,2016,02,16
211,Excellent hotel,My wife and I stayed here for valentines weekend. The room was first class. The staff we're very friendly and I could not find a fault with the hotel.

211,Excellent,"Stayed over Valentine's weekend and we were greeted at the reception with chocolates. As we entered we found a lovely bottle of prosecco waiting for us.

Not too far from the city centre and the staff were always on hand to order cabs for us
Would definitely stay here again ",5,2016,02,16
211,Wonderful ,"Can't recommend this hotel enough! The staff are wonderful and really helpful, the rooms are beautiful and it's the perfect place to stay if your attending something in croke park. Also it's a 15minute walk into the city centre which is good and a taxi from o connells street to the hotel was only 8euro. The food was lovely too and they even left us leave our suitcases in the hotel after we checked out as we didn't want to haul them around with us for the day! Loved my stay here ",4,2016,02,15

If you are heading to an event at Croke Park, why would you stay anywhere else? It really is the staff that elevate this from a great hotel to a superb hotel. The front desk staff are exceptional...always a smile, always helpful...the way it should be but seldom is, even in the, supposedly, superior hotels. Can recommend this hotel without reservation.",5,2016,02,12
211,Lovely hotel-great staff,Excellent hotel with lovely friendly staff and superb facilities on executive floor. Would definitely recommend the deluxe room package with continental breakfast and snacks /drinks throughout the day-well worth it. We also had free drinks vouchers for each day of our stay. Rooms are spotless and bathroom modern and very clean. Lovely toiletries with turn down service each night if you choose deluxe room option. Rooms on 4th floor were very quiet too.,5,2016,02,11

211,Michael,"Stayed at the Croke Park Hotel for 7 nights, including New Year. 45th (aggregate) night over previous 12 months. Always a warm and genuine welcome by friendly staff committed to a high standard of guest care. Deepak, in the Exec Lounge always chatty, cheerful, smiling and attentive. Terry, in the Sideline Bar, very conscientious and ready with a broad, welcoming smile. Sean and Philip very helpful when checking in and out. Christopher on concierge, always ready to help without being imposing. Room staff kept my accomodation in a high standard of presentation without being intrusive. Caroline, Sales, very helpful with booking and resourceful in resolving problem that arose with the reservation.
A very satisfactory stay. High standard of accommodation,  complemented by motivated and committed staff to provide an excellent guest service. 
Such a satisfying experience helped to mitigate my disappointment at not being being  provided with a double-upgraded room, as per the loyalty programme. Hopefully next time, in March.",5,2016,02,09
211,Weekend ideal,"This place is an ideal place to stay for a weekend in Dublin ,clean ,warm ,inviting,a warm welcome off staff,only thing I found to be wrong with this hotel was if you want to go to the dublins center(o'connells street)it was a 10 to 15min walk,I didn't mind the walk,but if you was older or had difficulty in walking you'd find it difficult,easy to reach from the airport,jump on one of the first direct buses,cost 10euros for the return journey to the airport,could use anytime we were told,plenty of taxis,everywhere ,allday and what seemed to be all night.",5,2016,02,09

211,Fantastic stay as always,"I would like to praise this hotel once again for a fantastic stay, we visit every 2 years for the rugby and wouldn't dream of staying any where else in Dublin.
All the staff are fantastic, the rooms are second to none, the best hotel I have ever stopped in.
The breakfast is fantastic, really cant fault this hotel in any way, cant wait to return in 2 years time.
Would Like to thank Sean and Catherine for all of there help in booking the rooms for our party of 28. Well done to every one at the Croke Park Hotel for making our stay so enjoyable.",5,2016,02,09
211,Rugby weekend,"Stayed here Saturday to Monday room 339 very busy here as matches across the road that we weren't aware of, packed, drinks in plastic glasses that I don't think was on if you were a guest, breakfast in room came and was cold then the man said we hadn't paid when we had, so canceled breakfast on the 2nd day!!..then a piece of paper put under the door as Janet from reception hadn't totaled our bill up and we owed €3!!!! Nice decor, clean rooms fresh towels.",3,2016,02,08
211,Fantastic stay at Croke Park,"The staff were a treat, excellent service, delicious food, clean room with fantastic facilities and a comfy bed! Spoiled us with complimentary prosecco for my partner's birthday! Thank you, Croke Park Hotel!!",5,2016,02,08
211,Stunning in every way,"I visit Croke Park Hotel regularly. The facilities, setting, food and service is top notch but it is the staff that encourages me to return continuously. Each and every staff member is friendly, courteous and make visitors feel like absolute superstars! An outstanding hotel with high standards which are unrivalled in Dublin. ",5,2016,02,07
211,"A well run hotel, very quiet and clean","We stayed here over the new year celebrations. Even though the hotel is quite a way from Dublin Centre, we still managed. There is not much in the way of restaurants and bars around the vicinity of the Hotel though. The Hotel has a restaurant that is fairly expensive, and a bar.",4,2016,02,07
211,Outstanding!,"We arrived at this property at 9am after a long overnight flight from NYC. Our room was not ready so we were given access to a lounge that had comfortable furnishings and some breakfast items to enjoy. We freshened up and hit the road to explore Dublin on the Hop on hop off tour which was included in the package we booked. I also must mention that a secure car park is located on premise and is free to guests. 
Our room was lovely. We found it to be clean, modern and comfortable. We had a great night sleep in a very comfortable bed. The property was much more luxurious than we had expected. 
Full Irish breakfast was included in the price of the room. It was among the best we had during our 10 night stay across Ireland. 
We would stay again without hesitation and I will certainly recommend it to anyone.",5,2016,02,06
211,Lovely hotel ,"Lovely hotel. Room was everything you needed and the breakfast is the best I've ever had. Staff were polite and accommodating. Although, after reading the reviews endlessly before we went, I expected more. We were never offered the warm flannels on arrival but the couple who checked in before were. Secondly, we were never offered water upon check out. I also informed the hotel we were traveling due to it being my partners birthday and received not even a happy birthday. 
Is a lovely hotel but left slightly disappointed due to reading other reviews. Would still recommend this hotel.  ",4,2016,02,05
211,Mini Moon Getaway,"My husband and I stayed in this beautiful hotel for our mini moon, just days after our magical wedding. We stayed during the week Monday to Friday & have not got a bad word to say about our stay, the restaurant, staff or our room!

 We ate breakfast in the Sideline Bistro daily & had dinner once there too. Every breakfast was delicious, plenty to choose from & served by polite, friendly staff. The one time we ate in the Bistro in the evening, the food we received was outstanding. I chose the soup of the day, spiced parsnip which was delicious followed by the special of coc au van. It was really tasty, the waitress commented that it may be put onto the main menu & I agree it should !!! We didn't have room for a dessert, but the choices looked great.

We had drinks in the bar most evenings & loved the choice of cocktails, especially the vanilla espresso martini!!! My husband, naturally, chose guiness!! 

Our room was well equipped & house keeping came daily & tidied, as expected. We never like to leave a room in a mess, so it was only the bed to be made properly & bathroom towels to be re stocked.

Overall we loved our stay, & would definitely return & recommend the hotel to family & friends!!! ",5,2016,02,05
211,Great hotel,Lovely hotel with great rooms and friendly staff. The bathroom was spotless and the room had good facilities. Well located  with free secure parking - a real bonus in Dublin. It takes 15 minutes to walk from the hotel to the top of O'Connell Street so it is well positioned near the Royal Canal. Don't be put of by the railway track next to it - there are no trains!,5,2016,02,03
211,Great Value for Business Traveler,"The Croke Park provided great amenities and comfortable room for the price. The Executive Lounge was ideal for getting work done and the car park was helpful as we had meetings in the outskirts of Dublin.  Not centrally located, so walking to many sights is a bit of hike, but still worth considering for the value.",4,2016,02,02
211,Fabulous Hotel,"I stayed here with my partner for my birthday a year ago and they went out of their way to make it special. We were upgraded to the executive floor, which gave us access to the executive lounge. There was two bottles of Prosecco in our room on arrival and even a cute birthday card from the staff at the hotel! The food in the hotel was absolutely amazing. The duck was cooked to perfection. The room we were in was right next to the Sam Maguire suite and even with people passing the door it was still really quiet. We also had a view of the GAA Stadium across the street and this never caused us any issues. The hotel is perfectly situated for both relaxing and exploring. We got a taxi from the hotel to the heart of Dublin easily from our hotel and were able to purchase the bus tour ticket for 2 days. We ate out a couple of night after recommendations from staff. I would definitely go back to this hotel as it is absolutely beautiful and well maintained.",5,2016,02,02
211,Excellent,"This was an excellent hotel, very clean.
Hotel rooms were comfortable and clean. 
Staff very friendly and always there to help. 

There was a gentleman (whose name I have forgotten) who was always there to help out with directions or recommendations on places to visit!

Only a bad couple of points
1. I was woken a few times in the night by noisy guests in the corridors early hours of the morning.
2. I had booked a room with two double beds however the room had one double and one single. 

Everything else was great!

",5,2016,02,02
211,Nice hotel,We really enjoyed our stay at the Croke Park Hotel. Staff could not have been more helpful. Good breakfast and nice dinner. Rather busy when there is a match on across the road but this adds to the atmosphere. The daily shuttle bus in front of the hotel enables quick and cheap access to the centre.,5,2016,02,02
211,Best Chain Hotel I Have Ever Stayed In!,"I booked this hotel through Trip Advisor. I was pleased to see all the great comments about the hotel and wasn't put off from the distance to the city centre. We arrived early on the Friday Morning, the trainee receptionist was great! Our room wasn't ready, understandable as it was only 9.00am. We got initially checked in and left our bags with the concierge and off we went. Outside the hotel isn't so pretty, but what else do you get for a CITY break. The one issue for me would be if there was any games on as it is just across the road from the stadium but as it was January so it wasn't a problem. Now for the walk into Dublin... we couldn't figure out if there was any direct route by bus so we walked it every day (once in the morning and then again in the evening) It took about 10-15mins for us but i wouldnt recommend it to anybody who hates walking and has mobility issues. But then again you cant get a hotel like that with all the extra facilities right on the river bank! 

My partner described the hotel as looking like a Premier Inn on the outside but a Hilton inside! The lobby was vast with cosy seating and enough space to relax like we did when we were waiting to leave at the end of our holiday. Our room was on the 2nd floor. The room had a double shower, bathtub and little extras like an iron, trouser press, hairdryer and The White Company toiletries!! The bed was the best i have ever slept in with duck down pillows and duvet, air con was great as well. I cant fault the room at all! The TV and CD Player was a bit outdated but for the amount of time we spent there it wasn't a problem. Free Wifi in our room which was soo handy to talk to family back home. We had book B&B and we are sooo glad! Again the best Full Irish/ Continental Breakfast ever. Nothing was too much for the waiting staff. Fresh toast and drinks as soon as you sat down. The breakfast was great and so much variety. Free Irish paper in the breakfast room everyday which pleased my partner very much. After breakfast you felt ready to explore Dublin. 

Check out was smooth and again we could leave our bags with the concierge. If i am ever back in Dublin i wont give another hotel a second look. This will be the one for us and it was a great deal and definitely value for money. ALWAYS go B&B as breakfast in the city centre (on calibur with the hotel could cost up to 15 euros each!)

I really enjoyed Dublin. We were there for pretty much 4 days. It is expensive, Pint of Guinness 5.50 euro. But it was the spirits that were pricey, 8.50 euro for a single vodka and coke! The measures are 1.5 x bigger than our but still 14 euros a round and you were soon out of cash. Do the Guinness tour even if you don't like it. (pre-book online though as its £22.00 each on the door)
There is live music in every bar and a range of restaurants. Try and go for set menus and early birds, normally on until 7pm. The Italian near the hotel is great! Dublin is friendly place and i will be visiting again!",5,2016,02,02
211,Excellent friendly hotel,"Stayed for wedding anniversary booked by our daughter, the staff were friendly, lovely room lots of extras had use of lounge which was great. This hotel is one of the best we have ever stayed in. Could not fault service, food excellent definitely recommend.",5,2016,02,02
211,Nicely Straight Forward,"Croke Park was great!  It was a very a great 4-star hotel, particularly the bathroom.  Perfect location is you are going to be spending any time at the Stadium.  The only downside is that the neighborhood is a little quiet.",4,2016,02,01
211,Great value for good price,"We enjoyed our stay very much. Very friendly staff, quiet and clean rooms, good breakfast! Shuttle bus to City Tours in front of the hotel. Perfect place to see a game in Croke Park Stadium. Any time again!",5,2016,02,01
211,Decent business hotel,"The Croke Park is located right next to ... the Croke Park stadium, which can be a good or bad thing depending on whether there are games and what you are there for. It is also within reasonable walking distance (20 min) from/to Eastpoint business park if you struggle to get a cab at rush hour.
The hotel is nice, reasonably modern. I asked for a quiet room on a high floor and I got a room way at the back of the building, a long trek from the elevators. The neighbourhood is not exactly scenic, the usual array of copycat brownstones and derelict post industrial land. 
Room was clean, bed confortable, wifi effective. Breakfast was pretty decent, omelette way overcooked as customary in Ireland. Restaurant also serves good food for dinner, a useful option after a long business day. In terms of practicality, comfort and value for money, I would put Croke Park on par with Clontarf Castle. ",4,2016,01,31
211,Lovely Hotel,Visited for 2 nights with family a lovely hotel and staff very friendly. Rooms are spacious and spotlessly clean. Ate in the dining room the first night and food and service perfect. Would stay again only thing that may be against some people is the walk into city but for us not a problem. Thank you. ,5,2016,01,30
211,A very Nice stay,"Great service that went above and beyond anything I expected.  Apparently plenty of others feel the same from reviews on the site and from others staying there.  The room was comfortable, the staff inviting, and small touches in the room really wrapped it all together.",5,2016,01,29
211,The Place to Stay in Dublin,Myself and husband stayed here for 6 days this month. Completely pleasant experience. We did stay on executive level so enjoyed king size bed plus access to lounge and snacks all day. The staff were incredibly attentive and pleasant. Access to other parts of the city was easy and an added bonus having secure parking included. The bar and restaurant were relaxed and fun.,5,2016,01,28
211,Lovely Hotel,Have stayed there a number of times on business and have always enjoyed my stays. Service is always friendly and with a smile and the food is excellent and good value as well. The buffet style breakfast has something for every taste and the hot option is fresh and.  The hotel has a secure car park which is free. Overall I would recommend this hotel if you are planning a stay in Dublin.,4,2016,01,27
211,Great hotel,"Little walk outside of main area but worth the effort. Great hotel with lovely staff. The young lady that checked us in was very helpful and went out of her way to suggest local restaurants (wish I had got her name but she did say she was also at uni in the area). We asked for a quiet room before we got to the hotel and were a little concerned when we got into room as we were only on 2nd floor with the train tracks outside the window, we never heard a thing. The room (245) was very nice with a large bathroom. Cleaning standard was high. 
We pre booked the breakfast  at a discounted rate and was worth every penny, very fresh with lots of choice. We also had dinner in the restaurant one evening and that was also very good. 
Only criticism we had in 4 days was the hotel was a little over warm, breakfast and dinner in January was done in a t shirt it was that warm. 
Overall would highly recommend.",5,2016,01,25
211,great stary,Great stay with very helpful staff and  room was perfect. it was my friends 30th and they had left a complimentary bottle of prosecco in the room for us. Nice touch. Definitely stay again. Great value for money,5,2016,01,25
211,Lovely Dublin hotel ,"Myself and my girlfriend have just stayed here for the weekend. We caught the 747 bus from the airport which drops you off about a 5 minute walk from the hotel. The hotel itself is spotless. Very smart inside and couldn't fault the room. Reception and concierge were both very helpful and polite whenever we needed help with any questions we had. The bar area is nice and big and although we didn't eat there ourselves some of the food being brought out looked very nice! The location of the hotel could be considered the only down side, although it didn't bother us too much. It's about a 15 minute walk to o'connell street, where most of the buses start/stop and 20 minutes to temple bar area. We had a taxi to temple bar area once which cost around 12 euro. There is a shuttle bus on Saturday and Sunday which runs between the hotel and o'connell street. We had a taxi from the hotel to the airport for our return which cost 22€. I would happily return to this lovely hotel again and would recommend it if you don't mind a little bit of walking.",4,2016,01,25
211,Amazing weekend of birthday celebrations.,2 nights in Jan with 5 other couples. Booked a superior room with 2 double beds which had a view of the stadium.  We arrived at 9 am after a very early flight expecting to just drop our bags off but to our amazement our rooms were ready so we were able to freshen up and enjoy the day to the fullest.  We asked for bathrooms and slippers and although they only came with deluxe rooms they were promptly delivered. Spacious bathroom with double shower and separate bath tub. White Company products. Ample tea/coffee in room.,5,2016,01,24
211,Life savers ,"We planned last minute to drive to Dublin and stay at the croke park hotel. On our way down our car broke down 15 minutes from the hotel, when we called the hotel they where a life saver and helped us get out of bad situation when on the phone to them they gave us phone numbers to pick up trunks to pick up the car and booked a taxi to collect us! We have stayed before at the crokepark hotel and love it! The only thing that I have to complain about is at around 1 in the morning I was hot and needed to get ice, when trying to get back in to the room the key card wouldn't work so I had to go down to the reception to get it fixed (I work in a hotel up north called the galgorm and know how things are done ) but when asking the night porter to reencode my key he made me feel like I was putting him out of his way and while walking behind the desk he was kicking boxes which just made me feel like I had annoyed him from his ""bussy"" night! But really did enjoy our stay and thought that the woman at ception and the porter who helped us with our car made our dublin trip get back on track ",4,2016,01,23
211,Superb.,"Came on a two night stay booked through travel republic. Couldn't fault it on any level, the staff are friendly and helpful, the hotel cleanliness is superb and the rooms were spacious and warm. We had breakfast each morning which was a delight - I've never seen honey comb or tried white pudding before.

The food in the bistro was also tasty and reasonably priced, again the waiting staff are incredibly friendly and helpful. Our waitress was very attentive and kind. 

We also paid separately for the Dublin bus tour which conveniently picked us up from the hotel. This is possibly the only thing I can think of to change/improve - there are no return busses to bring us back to the hotel. With the hotel being a little bit further away we ended up catching the bus home twice. This wasn't too difficult, but the busses seem quite unreliable. We waited 20 mins for the 13 which never materialised and ended up waking to another stop to wait for the 123 which seems more reliable. Unfortunately there aren't many shelters in Dublin centre, so we did get soaked on our second night!

However, this can be overlooked. I knew how far the hotel was from the centre when I booked it and a taxi may have been quite cheap; we only got busses as our freedom pass permitted us to use public transport.

Overall, we were delighted with our stay, would recommend it to anyone travelling to Dublin and hope to visit again!",5,2016,01,22
211,"lovely, friendly, comfortable hotel","staff here are great, even with grumpy kids in tow, they were very accommodating-providing colouring bags at the bistro and showing us maps of where to go. Only downside is its a little out of town, fine for adults to walk but a bit far for young kids so had to get taxi's. Can't fault the hotel at all though, would definitely stay again, lovely first class service and rooms. Beds were really comfortable aswell.",5,2016,01,22
211,Relaxing weekend,"Stayed here for a weekend with my other half and loved it. the rooms are very comfortable, staff are nice and informative, you feel welcome as you walk in the doors. Had no problems during our stay. would recommend staying at this hotel. wouldn't go anywhere else.",5,2016,01,21
211,good for short city break,we stayed for mid-week break and enjoyed our visit in this well kept hotel.excellent breakfasts and ample beds and rooms which were always warm and a delight to come back to after sightseeing the city that is only a 10 minute walk away,5,2016,01,21
211,Great stay in Dublin,"We stayed as a group of 8.  
Reservation by phone was simple, good value and accurate for our needs.  
Rooms are spotless, beds very comfortable, breakfast enjoyable. 
Hotel asked for any special requests in advance and acted on them.
I'd have no hesitation in booking again.  ",5,2016,01,21
211,fantastic hotel and staff :-),"Stayed at croke park for the new year, absolutely lovely hotel. Stayed on executive floor, fantastic room and executive suite with complimentary tea, coffee and juices etc. 15-20 min walk to temple bar but hotel made up for walking and getting wet, …
Peter W.",5,2016,01,19
211,Great Hotel!,Spent two nights here on my first visit to Dublin this weekend and thoroughly enjoyed it! Rooms were spacious and extremely comfortable and all the staff were very friendly and helpful. Loved the breakfast and had a great nights sleep. Highly recommended as is only 10 mins from town too.,5,2016,01,18
211,Excellent ,"Confortable rooms, very helpfull staff.
Hotel is very clean and cosy. 
Location is good,about 20 min walking distance from the city center. 
Generaly all was on the very high level.
Very easy to explore Dublin center from this hotel and staff will explain you everything with smile.
",5,2016,01,17
211,Really enjoyed our stay,"Away from the loud streets of the town centre (15 minutes walk), this hotel was a welcome retreat after our days and evenings out in Dublin. 
It's was very clean and the staff were extremely attentive and professional.
Breakfast was ok. Bar area cooks a good burger, made from freshly minced beef.
Room was much better than expected for the price.

If you found this review useful, I would really appreciate if you could click on 'Thank John A', as that will improve my own Trip Advisor rating.
",5,2016,01,17
211,More central than you'd think,"Stayed here for Mumford and sons concert mainly because of the price and although I thought it wasn't to central to the city I was wrong. It is within walking distance to o connell  street . It is a beautiful hotel from the minute you walk in ,  the staff are very friendly ,good bar food served ,great breakfasts, great entertainment in the bar and secure car parking. All in all a great couple of days and will defiantly be returning.",5,2016,01,17
211,Fantastic Hotel,"Stayed here for a few days for our wedding anniversary and the front desk had placed a very nice hand written card and some Prossecco in our room for our arrival. A great touch. Hotel is very clean and modern and the rooms quite spacious. White Company toiletries are included and were very much appreciated. Towels were changed every day and the option to have your bed linen changed also. The continental breakfasts are well worth paying for, food was great and service impeccable. Restaurants in both the Bistro and the Bar was lovely, well presented and delicious. All the staff we met (front desk, bar staff, waiting staff and housekeeping were all very friendly and genuinely all wanted to help. I will absolutely stay here again when I revisit Dublin.",5,2016,01,16
211,Very Good Hotel,My Family and I stayed here for two days and it was a very pleasant stay. The staff were happy and the rooms were comfortable we would recommend this hotel to others. The Croke football stadium is just across the road nice and convenient.,4,2016,01,15
211,Very good hotel!,"Stayed here for an early Christmas break 21/12/15 - 23/12/15. Very welcoming staff on arrival who provided us with refreshing hand towels! Our room was perfect a double bed each! with a big bathroom and walk in shower. Breakfast was first class, a perfect base to explore Dublin city centre, which is a approx a 10 minute walk away. Will stay here again.",5,2016,01,15
211,"In ONE word ""VERY GOOD""","Friendly, quick and a very good service/standard, well done!! Above any of my expectations. Food was good and staff at the reception help us to find our way in Dublin.
Thanks again and we will see you later :)
",5,2016,01,15
211,Simply The Best,"I was lucky enough to stay in the Croke Park Hotel  in an executive room last week for a night. This hotel is amazing and the reason why, is they do everything right.The welcome was very friendly and efficient as were the refreshing hand flannels. The room was extremely comfortable with lots of lovely touches. The executive lounge was on hand with homemade biscuits and a variety of teas and coffees. Dinner and Breakfast were first class .It was so nice to have something different available for breakfast  (e.g. stewed rhubarb). It was my first time staying in this hotel thank you Pauline for the recommendation. I would highly recommend it to anyone looking for a real quality hotel in Dublin with excellent staff. I will be back.",5,2016,01,14
211,Lovely well kept hotel,"Stayed for one night, arrived early and room wasn't ready but staff brilliant, directing us to park in their carpark and looking after our luggage whilst we went off site seeing.  Room was lovely with separate walk in shower and large bath, nice breakfast - couldn't ask for more",4,2016,01,14
211,Excellently appointed hotel,"Large rooms and bathrooms, excellently appointed with all facilities. Not the best area in town to be in from a tourist point of view in that shopping and sights were a bit of a walk but that suited us as you need to walk off some of the eating. 

Excellent food and breakfast available.",5,2016,01,14
211,Great stay yet again!!,"We stayed at the Croke Park again over the holiday period. I think it gets better, there really is no reason to stay anywhere else in central Dublin. Don't let the location put you off (other reviews make a lot of the less than salubrious surroundings) this really isn't an issue especially due to the hotel's excellent quality and value. It is easily walkable to the very centre of the city, this takes less than 15 minutes. The staff are the best part of the Croke Park experience, especially Aisling who was helping out at breakfast whilst we were there but also seems to run the exec lounge on the fourth floor. It is obvious that this hotel is well run and this customer focused attitude filters efficiently down through all levels of staff. Keep up the good work!!",5,2016,01,12
211,Family Break,"Lovely hotel, excellent welcome on arrival with hot towel and also a bottle of water on departure.  Staff very friendly and kids no hassle in this hotel.  Everything was clean and food was excellent. If I was to pick one fault it would be the pressure in the shower which was very low but other than that great hotel and location.",4,2016,01,12
211,Birthday Trip to Dublin!,"Just returned from a wonderful long weekend in Dublin. My boyfriend picked this hotel as a surprise as he knows how picky I am with hotels after working in the industry! It didn't disappoint at all. 
We arrived early from the airport around 10am, a little tired from the early start but much to our surprise our room was ready! After a wonderful check-in, which had lovely little touches such as the warm towels we got to our room. We had an executive room on the 4th floor and I must say it is worth the extra. As well as getting access to the executive lounge, which we found really useful, we got 2 free drinks for every night we were staying. These could be delivered to our room, the executive lounge or used in the main bar and restaurant. A couple of hours after checking in, Prosecco and a hand written card were delivered to our room as they were aware it was my birthday, such a nice touch and shows how tentative the staff are with their guests considering this is a big hotel. 
This hotel is about a 20 minute walk from the temple bar area but easily done nevertheless. The hotel staff are wonderful, they go out of their way to help you with anything. We got a taxi to and from to town a few times, it's about 6 euros if you walk up to O'Connell street.
Lovely also to spend some time in the bar/restaurant, they have a huge screen which my boyfriend loved watching the football on and do fab cocktails!
A wonderful trip, thankyou! Lovely little thoughtful touches.",5,2016,01,11
211,Excellent,"Stayed here on a weekend break for my birthday. Considering the (relatively low for Dublin) price we paid I was expecting just an average hotel. We were pleasantly surprised. The hotel itself is a little way from the main city center area but a 20 minute walk at most. The room was very spacious and clean and had a separate bath and a shower in the bathroom. The bar was also very nice but we didn't try the food, only had drinks which were priced roughly in line with that of a city center pub. Highly recommend this hotel. The staff also gave us hot flannels on arrival to freshen up and bottles of water on departure which was a nice touch.",5,2016,01,11
211,Exceeded Expectations,Really impressed with the Croke Park. From the other reviews on Tripadvisor it seemed as though myself and my partner had made a good choice but from the moment we checked in to leaving it exceeded our expectations. The main reason for this was the staff. Of course the lovely room and free parking and free wifi helped but the friendliness of the staff who actually seemed as though they wanted to make our stay a good one was the main positive of the hotel. Even when we checked out we were offered a bottle of water each which was a lovely touch. Would definitely revisit.,5,2016,01,11
211,Great as usual,"Both my wife and I spent a lovely 3 night break in this excellent hotel. Every aspect was high quality. The room, the housekeeping, the reception team and the bar team. It was a birthday treat. The bar team picked this up and presented me with a birthday dessert complete with ""the choir."" No reluctance in recommending this hotel. Will book again soon.",5,2016,01,10
211,Excellent value for money,"Expecting a standard hotel taking the price into consideration, this hotel was far from it.
Both the interior and exterior of the hotel were very modern and well furnished. The rooms were done to a high standard and the bathroom and bedroom were a very large size.
Though there was some confusion over the cost of breakfast, the staff were extremely pleasant and helpful. 
The hotel restaurant for both breakfast and dinner is also very good value for money.

",5,2016,01,10
211,Classy and affordable,This is a wonderful hotel.  Hotel staff is extremely professional and courteous.  I would reccomend to everyone.  The location is extremely convenient for all travelers needing the airport.  I was also told it is great for the stadium as well.,5,2016,01,09
211,brilliant hotel,"Excellent hotel, would highly recommend it. Short walk to O'Connell Street. Plan to use this hotel next time. Fab breakfast & gym. Lots of areas to sit & relax. Everyone was so helpful. Very very clean. Lovely bathroom & comfy bed. What more could you ask for? ",5,2016,01,09
211,Sky tv,"Seriously. Do you really need three TV screens in the bar one being about 16 ft projected over a really lovely fire place? Trying to enjoy a drink and chat only to see the most terrible newes on the planet. 
Give us a break, really",2,2016,01,08
211,I'm hard to please and this was fantastic!,"I was so impressed with this hotel, I'd nearly class it as a 5 star, and was talking to a local resident in the bar who echoed my exact sentiments. Everything was so easy and hassle free. We stayed on the top (4th) floor in an executive room overlooking the canal. It's definitely worth paying that little bit extra for an executive room as you have access to the executive lounge where you will find tea, coffee, juice, fruit and cookies. You also have extras like robes and a minibar in an executive room, as well as a turn down service in the evening . I booked 3 nights directly through the hotel's website and received 20% off the total rate plus free breakfast. Cannot believe how good the price was. It took us about 15 minutes to stroll to the top of O'Connell Street, we walked in and back every night and it was very safe. The breakfast was divine, as was the bar food. There is a great room service menu and movies on demand. All of the staff we encountered were so helpful and nothing was too much trouble. A very minor gripe as I am a light sleeper - I found that every morning around 8am there seemed to be cleaning/maintenance staff slamming doors on the corridor which woke me. This shouldn't trouble you if you are not a light sleeper. Will most definitely be going back.",5,2016,01,08
211,Near and far enough from city center,"Short taxi €7 to city center. Friendly staff. Great breakfast. Rooms clean and fresh. Meals in bar/lounge very good and reasonable prices.  Nice buzz. Ideal to visit stadium. Recommend any time. Have visited on several occasions, it has always been a pleasure. ",5,2016,01,07
211,Outstanding Hotel,"Clean, elegant, and truly professional… The hotel exudes modern elegance in the heart of Dublin.  The rooms are outstanding, the hotel appears to be newly remodeled, good service overall, and truly a really great value - we felt that we got more than we paid for.",5,2016,01,07
211,Great,"The staff went the extra mile for us during our stay and made sure we had a great time. The hotel was lovely, clean, and the food was great. The bar had great staff and drinks as well. I'd definitely stay here again. I absolutely love Dublin Ireland. ",5,2016,01,04
211,Over night  stay,"I love staying at this hotel as I always find the Staff so friendly and helpful. 
Hotel rooms are excellent and I cannot fault the restaurant either.
Location is excellent and just a 15 minute walk into the city center.",5,2016,01,04
211,"Great hotel, central location","Stayed in a family room for two nights on a bed and breakfast basis, Hotel was spotlessly clean, food and service were second to none.  Huge array of food for the buffet breakfast. Dinner was excellent and delicious.  Location is good as we were able to walk to Henry Street on a beautiful sunny morning yet is only 8/9 km from the Airport. Staff are extremely friendly and helpful  - I observed a staff member assisting a resident book a flight last night. The four of us including children were presented with hot towels on arrival and provided with a bottle of water for our journey on departure.  Its the little things that make a difference.  Third family stay here in 12 months as every member of the family enjoyed it.",5,2016,01,03
211,7* stay! ,"Greeted by friendly staff at reception with hot towels, as soon as you walk in your room you can see the attention to detail that each staff member pays, from the selection of teas and biscuits to the robes and slippers everything is pristine! We even got left 5 vouchers for the sideline bar, for a drink for both of us for each night of our stay saving us around €75! Breakfast is really well organised, with a fab selection of hot and continental choices, was very sad to only discover the pancakes and pastries on the morning we were leaving though, they were beautiful! 

1 downside is the view from the room, it didn't bother us at all because we were never in the room but I know sometimes you can get, well, 'fussy' travellers so don't expect a sprawling vista of Dublin if your in a back room! 

All in all, best hotel I have probably ever stayed in! Loved it and won't think of anywhere else if we return to Dublin! 

Thanks Croke Park! ",5,2016,01,03
211,5  * Experience,"Fabulous 2 night stay which highlights the hotels policy of high quality service. At check in we were greeted by friendly staff with hot towels so we could freshen up after our journey. We were given complimentary access to the executive lounge which boasts comfy sofas, wide screen TV and complimentary tea, coffee, cookies, water and juice bottles and newspapers. The hotel takes care with the small things - turn down service with chocolates on pillows, robes and slippers. Also a handwritten note and gift for our daughter who was celebrating her birthday. Food at breakfast and in lounge was very good and again service throughout was excellent. Would highly recommend this hotel.",5,2016,01,01
211,great hotel,I arrived early after an overnight trip from San Francisco.  We were able to check in early and were given herb infused steamed towels to freshen up with. The room was clean and quiet.  There was a game one night and it got a little noisy but quieted down by 9 pm. I would stay there again.,5,2016,01,01
211,Enjoyable stay,Experienced another enjoyable stay in the hotel . The staff are very courteous and at tentative. Hotel is very clean and rooms are well equipped and comfortable and breakfast of the highest standard . An ideal location as just a15 mins walk into the city centre and taxi costs approx 12 euros . My only concern was how the price has increased considerably  from last year and how the second night was more expensive but this is surely a sign of it's popularity and reputation.,4,2016,01,01
211,excellent place to stay,"it's really a lovely place, all the staff are very kind, and the  chefs are great  , they cook to the perfection, the hotel location is convenient to the city center, the bedroom was bright and warm, all you need on a very wet day",5,2015,12,31
211,Nice Hotel,"Nice hotel, very friendly staff, we only stayed one night but had a nice stay, very quiet room despite looking out onto a railway line, there were no trains at all when we were in the room. We had a meal in the hotel, it is quite expensive.",5,2015,12,30
211,Best Hotel in Dublin,Have stayed many times and always the same standard of excellence....would not consider staying anywhere else in Dublin...the friendly staff especially those at the front desk the food-the cleanliness- is first class.Look forward to my next visit.  ,5,2015,12,29
211,Excellent,"We stayed at this hotel for our Christmas Night in Croke Park Stadium.
Staff very welcoming and accommodating.  Overall décor very clean crisp and spacious.  Rooms were excellent and the hotel was decorated very tastefully for the Christmas.
Will definitely put it on my list for next outing.
",5,2015,12,29
211,Service at it's very best,"Stayed here on Dec 22 with family on visit to Dublin for shopping. Welcomed warmly by young pleasant man (Philip) who told us all we needed to make our stay comfortable. We're given voucher for hot chocolate and went to our room (room 211). We came out of the lift to a lovely smell of fresh paint and the luxurious feeling of new carpet underfoot. The room was big and spacious, with a bath and a separate shower cubicle. My wife then went down to the bar for the hot chocolates only to be told that they would be delivered to our room...what lovely touches. Markus brought them promptly to our room and we had one of the best night's sleep we'vs had in any hotel for some time. Breakfast was a lovely experience. Greeted by more pleasant Irish staff with time to ask how we were and to offer tips on parking and bus routes. Being in the hotel business ourselves we tend to avoid the full Irish when away with the family and there were many alternatives for our family. Great coffee, and given in plentiful supply. Checkout very smooth by the very professional Ian who allowed us to leave car  in carpark while we visited the city. We normally stay at another Dublin venue but we believe we've found a new gem. Please keep up the good standards, you are really out on your own folks.",5,2015,12,27
211,Beautiful break ,"Came here from England a week before christmas as a birthday surprise and the hotel is beautiful. The location/views aren't all that brilliant but the inside is stunning and I've never come across such friendly staff! Every staff member says hello and smiles as you walk by which is rare to find these days! I must mention the gentlemen member of staff Noticed on Saturday 19th December at around lunchtime in the lobby. I assume he was part of management or concierge or something and he had noticed a lady with two disabled young children waiting for a taxi, he made extra effort to ensure they were comfortable, offering a drink to her and a hot chocolate for the children as well as allowing the two boys to whizz around the lobby in their wheelchairs which the rest of us waiting for taxis fully enjoyed :) you would expect in such a fancy place for staff to be a bit snooty about that so it was lovely to see. My only complaint is that we upgraded our room and were on the 4th floor and ours was part of an ajoining room with a door between us and the one next door and it was so loud :( there was a gap under the door which we had to stuff with our clothes to muffle some of the tv noise from them as it wasn't relaxing at all when they were in. Perhaps some kind of soundproofing would be better in those rooms. Other than that, a really enjoyable stay, Thankyou. ",4,2015,12,27
211,Great place to stay,"Spend two nights here before Christmas. Was very impressed with the hotel and service. The room we had was huge with an impressive bathroom. The floor looked to have been recently renovated as there was a slight smell of paint just as you got of the elevator but there was no smell in our room that was further on down the hotel. 
The room faced the railway line that runs past the rear of the hotel but the trains are infrequent and does not disturb .

Breakfast was good and had a variety of food on offer. The service from the staff was very good.

Location is within walking distance of the city centre and very close to bus routes.

I would highly recommend this hotel and will definitely stay here again.",5,2015,12,27
211,Loved our stay here,My husband and I booked this hotel hours before arriving. The staff was very kind and the rooms were so clean. The bathroom was huge! The elevators were being painted so one morning we woke up to the painters talking. If you enjoy walking this is a great place to stay in order to be out of the hustle and bustle of city center. It only took about 10-15 min to get to Grafton street but a very nice walk. Easy to find a taxi to get back after a late night in the pubs. We loved staying here and would certainly go back!,5,2015,12,27
211,Just OK,"Booked a weekend stay at croke park for my husband and i, paid 330 euros for 2 nights which included a room upgrade (which we never got) breakfast both mornings which was of decent variety and well managed, food was nice,and one evening meal, we never went for the evening meal as it meant returning from temple bar or the city center to go back out again and theres no many lovely places in dublin to eat, drink and be merry. The loaction of the croke park was dissapointing, next to a littered canal and a scabby takeaway, maybe i should have done some more research before i booked, next time we visit i think ill book the Gresham or temple bar hotel as all in all i think 330 euros was overpriced for this hotel.",3,2015,12,24
211,"Clean rooms, friendly staff. ","Check-in was relatively quick and easy.  The rooms are very comfy, modern and spotless.  The location is a little out of town but plenty of transport nearby. 
My only dissatisfaction was that there was no guest laundry and to have the hotel wash your clothes was the usual ridiculous price (it was cheaper to buy a pair of new socks than to have them washed).  This meant that we had to find a laundromat which wasn't too easy and wasted a few hours in the process. 
The full breakfast could be a little better (bacon undercooked, other ""hot""  breakfast items were only warm) and the coffee was from a machine which wasn't great. 

Other than that, it was a nice hotel and again, the staff were very friendly and helpful.  Perhaps some work on the breakfast and having laundry facilities would shift it up to 5 stars for me. 

",4,2015,12,22
211,Just keep coming back here,"Spent another Saturday night here on 19th December.  Exactly the same high quality stay.  All staff are very helpful. Emailed Sean beforehand and all requests were granted as usual.  Cannot rate this hotel highly enough for my wife and I, provides all our needs in regard to comfort, friendliness, services, food, great little gym for a workout and every other thing you could imagine in a hotel and all for a very reasonable price.
This time we were served at breakfast by a lovely, pleasant and very attentive waitress called Aisling, she made the breakfast experience even more enjoyable.
Well done to Sean, Aisling and all the brilliant staff at the Croke Park Hotel for another excellent stay
My wife and I will be back in the hotel again on 3rd January for the sales and I have no doubt that the Croke Park Hotel will once again provide the same high class, super efficient services that it always does.
You will not get a better hotel in Dublin, don't delay, just book it.
Thank you very much for everything and my wife and I are already looking forward to our next visit.",5,2015,12,22
211,"Great hotel, amazing staff",I was here for one night on a quick trip over with kids to visit croke park. This hotel is modern and everything looks brand new. The staff were super helpful and service was quick and efficient. We only had breakfast there but was a great selection that kept my kids going the whole day for their fun in Croke Park,5,2015,12,21
211,Fantastic ,"Just got back from a fantastic stay at this top hotel. Food and service was excellent. Spacious room and a lovely card and 2 bottles of wine for
My husbands birthday. Nothing is too much trouble. Full Irish buffet breakfast fills you up ready for lots of shopping ",5,2015,12,21
211,Wonderful stay,"Very impressed with this hotel in an amazing city full of character and charm.
Very friendly staff and fab location. Will be recommending to all. 
Although we arrived ahead of check in time, we were allocated a room to freshen up and nothing was too much to ask for.
Thank you for a lovely pre-Xmas getaway! ",5,2015,12,21
211,Perfect for city break,"We stayed here for three nights in December. We had an executive room which cost about £80 a night. 

The room was very clean and spacious. The room came complete with luxury toiletries and a bottle of Prosecco was provided on arrival as we were celebrating a birthday.

The hotel didn't appear to be in the nicest part of Dublin but the walk to the centre was pleasant and the neighbourhood appeared safe. It is about a 15minute walk to the centre of Dublin. 

The executive room gives you access to the 4th floor executive lounge. The lounge is where you get the complimentary continental breakfast as part of your stay.

The breakfast consists of pastries, bread, fruit, cereal and some cold meats. This along with fresh tea, coffee and bottled juice was more than enough for a quick breakfast. Tea, coffee, bottles of water & juice are available all day.

The sideline bar was very nice with live music and great service from staff. The Heineken extra cold was a very good pint.

",4,2015,12,21
211,You won't find an amazing hotel like this anywhere in the World!,Can't say enough about this amazing hotel. Sean Reid the Manager & ALL of the staff here are to be highly commended for always going that extra mile. The atmosphere amongst the staff is lovely & this hotel just go out of their way to make your stay the best it can be. Love coming back here & thanks to an amazing team….see you all in 2016 xx,5,2015,12,21
211,5 star hotel defiantly ,Top class hotel! Would defiantly give it 5 star.. From the minute we entered it was heaven with wet cloths on arrival to freshen up to prosecco on ice in the hotel suite! Food in the sideline bistro was to die for all! Will defiantly return again ,5,2015,12,21
211,A family friendly hotel,"We had a lovely stay in this hotel with our family, including our grandchildren. The staff were all very friendly & helpful, the rooms are spacious are kept very clean, very comfortable beds and big bathrooms.  Food was very gexcellent, good selection at breakfast and good choice of dinner menus as well.  We found the restaurant staff were very helpful and kind towards the children, always tried to put us (11 in the group) together at one table. The hotel also has good location, just about 15 minutes’ walk to Dublin city center, or you can get a taxi costs about €8 - €10. The free car parking is really a bonus.  This is really a good hotel; great location & we definitely would like to come back again!",5,2015,12,20
211,A pure pleasurable stay 🎅🎅🎅🎅,"What an absolute fantastic friendly warm welcoming hotel....would give it 5⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ staff and management could not have been any nicer or helpful,from arrival to departure excellent ....myself and family stayed for a quality catch up before the mental rush of Christmas what a pleasure ...",5,2015,12,20
211,fantastic hotel,"This Hotel is  a credit to hotels in general it is in a brilliant location staff will go the extra mile to help you and it is family friendly with spacious rooms  everything in pristine condition and cleanliness is top standard, no bad odours.
 Amenities: Free Wifi,  Parking spaces are good and spacious also .",5,2015,12,18
211,Superb Hotel,"My wife and I stayed in this hotel for a one night stay. The whole experience was most pleasurable. Our welcome was warm and friendly by reception staff.

The hotel is modern, the rooms are clean as are the bathrooms. It's a short stroll to the city centre and parking is included for residents.

We ordered food in the bar area which was perfect. The waiters couldn't have been nicer. Friendly and efficient. Super large screen in bar, great for watching the sport. 

We went out for the evening and on our return in the early hours of the morning we were checked by security for our room numbers and authenticity which was reassuring! 

We will definitely be back! Thank you all.

",5,2015,12,17
211,Lovely Hotel - just watch when checking out!!,Enjoyed a lovely stay here for our wedding anniversary and can say the hotel was lovely and was in the middle of being renovated (the rooms were being repainted).  The hotel was spacious and staff were helpful.  The food in the hotel was lovely and can definitely recommend the lamb.  The beds were comfy and the bathroom had both a walk in shower and bath.  The hotel is about a 20 minute walk into Dublin but there is public transport and the hotel can arrange for taxis.  Please note though when checking out if you have previously paid for the room and put a card down for additional items they don't charge your card for the price of the room which they did with me and I had to wait for a refund!!  Would definitely recommend.,4,2015,12,17
211,Perfect Hotel!!,"Such a lovely hotel!! Great location, can walk to city centre/temple bar in about 20 minutes. Opposite Croke Park so it's nice and easy to locate, we got a bus from the airport for €3 and were dropped just around the corner, the driver directed us from there. 

I booked this trip for a 21st birthday present and arrived to two mini bottles of prosecco and a little note wishing my boyfriend happy birthday which started our trip off perfectly!! Both the bathroom and room were spotless on arrival and were kept spotless throughout our stay. We also had access to the executive lounge which served breakfast 6.30-10.30am and coffee/tea etc throughout the day.

We didn't get a chance to try the hotel food but it looked amazing!! Would also highly recommend Chameleon in town for food, lovely little Indonesian restaurant. 

All round amazing stay!! The attention to detail and the little finishing touches top it off! Would definitely recommend and will hopefully be back soon! ",5,2015,12,17
211,Very enjoyable break,"We stayed at this hotel for 2 nights and after a diverted flight we didn't arrive till 2.30am ! however the welcoming was great and the bar still open so we had a quick drink and straight to bed which was massive.
Breakfast was lovely and plentiful. The concierge was very helpful.
The only drawback is the location, it is not directly on a bus route so if you are using the airport bus expect a 10minute walk and same into town uinless you use taxis.     ",5,2015,12,17
211,Lovely hotel,Thoroughly enjoyed our 3 nights in this comfortable hotel. A little out the way for most tourist attractions however that just meant we were able to explore! The room was very comfortable and the staff were ever so friendly,4,2015,12,16
211,Excellent mid range hotel,"Croke Park Hotel
 
Excellent mid range hotel
 
Directly opposite Croke Park Stadium. Five minutes walk from buses and local train services.
 
Very helpful and attentive concierge and reception staff.
 
Large room spotlessly clean.
 
 We had a very good and reasonably priced bar snack on arrival (burger for me and Quinoa salad for my partner). The hot breakfast was excellent.",5,2015,12,16
211,"Difficult to locate, Odd location, and a Bit rundown","Had quite a bit of difficulty locating the hotel. It's situated in a location just that little bit too far from the key tourist, bar, and restaurant areas to be ideal.
Noise levels were fine, and whilst the quality was ok, the rooms felt worn, a bit dated, and not luxurious as promoted.
Our stay was ok, but in future, I'd stay somewhere else.",3,2015,12,15
211,Superb Quality Hotel,"This is a 4 star hotel with 5 star service - I stay here regularly with my job and can honestly say I look forward to coming here . The bar food is good with a nice lounge area showing all the football on a big screen which is handy when you are over for 4 nights at a time . You can be in O'Connell street in about 15-20 mins walk or a Taxi is around €8 to Temple bar area . The rooms are comfortable and the bathrooms are spotless , staff friendly and it has a nice relaxed vibe to it . I would not dream of moving to any other hotel in Dublin - I have tried others in the past but this is the best by far. 
Whether its business or pleasure you will not be disappointed .",5,2015,12,15
211,City break,"The Croke park hotel is in an excellent location when visiting Dublin, the staff are very efficient and friendly. our stay was for two nights but due to a family illness we had to check out after one night. the manager on duty in reception was very helpful  with our checkout. The rooms were very spacious and clean",5,2015,12,14
211,Great Stay,"We stayed here while visiting the Croke Park Santa Experience. Every part of the hotel was immaculate. The staff were all very helpful & friendly. We were glad to see such secure parking, and my daughter was delighted when we got to our room to discover that we had a view of Croke Park. The bar food was lovely & reasonably priced. Breakfast was very good, lots of choice.",5,2015,12,14
211,I could not find any fault with this hotel,"luxurious hotel and in very close proximity to City Centre.
Excellent value for money.
excellent breakfast.
very comfortable and clean rooms.
excellent view od Croke Park stadium
Free paper each morning and free bottles of water when checking out.
Excellent parking facilities",5,2015,12,14
211,Good but with a few comments,"The location was good being near the city but not too close, perhaps a 20 minute walk. Being on the north side of the city was great for the airport.
Our room on the 4th floor Executive area was well equipped and comfortable with the only comments being the water flow into the sink was somewhat slow and the lighting for shaving a little dim.
The Executive lounge would be somewhat a disappointment for a business travellers as it only provided for continental style breakfast, it was necessary to go to the main restaurant for an Irish breakfast which was really good and didn't offer any food after coming in after the working day.    ",4,2015,12,14
211,Absolute travesty,"Well, it is an absolute travesty that this hotel is only a 4* hotel. Anybody that has rated this hotel at any less are nitpickers. Got this hotel on a whim from the travel agent and mainly cause of how cheap it was. Read all the reviews but this hotel deserves the highest rating possible. Booked 3 rooms for a group of 7 that arrived for a 2 night stay to celebrate my birthday. Arrived at 10am and immediately staff on reception did what they could to get us checked in so we didn't have to wait. Rooms were spacious with every essential  needed. Beds and cover super clean and so comfy. Bathroom had a bath and separate shower with the thickest fluffiest towels. Everything so clean you could eat your dinner off any surface in the room. We ate a couple of times in the bar and everything we did eat was delicious and reasonably priced. Breakfast was a plenty and again delicious with staff being very attentive. Staff all over the hotel will do everything you ask and nothing is not too much trouble. From getting extra toast to recommending places of interest  and arranging taxis. Special shout out goes to Abbas the night manager, who had more patience than a saint. After having 7 women almost fall in the hotel in the early hours in varying states of drunkenness, he dealt with us in a very polite professional manner. Was helpful happy and friendly, and when I mentioned that it was a birthday celebration I was given a box of chocolates and when I returned to my room at 4.30am I found waiting for me 3 bottles of proscetto in a ice bucket, 3 glasses and a card. How lovey was that??? All hail Abbas!! It is because of this hotel I will be coming back to Dublin, and I won't even be considering to look at another hotel to stay in. Croak park has everything and more. Just a few minutes to town centre, you would be a fool to go to Dublin and not stay in this hotel! Thank you, this hotel made my birthday weekend perfect!",5,2015,12,13
211,Couldn't ask for more.,"I have just returned from a one night stay at the Croke Park, we had booked a standard room, we were travelling with my sister who had booked an executive room.  Before we left the hotel had emailed to ask if we had any special requests, I asked to have a room close to my sister, and were delighted to be informed on arrival we had been upgraded to an executive room with complimentary continental breakfast.  The room was excellent the breakfast more than sufficient, the staff very helpful ,the place was spotles and the car park was free couldnt ask for more.",5,2015,12,13
211,"Nice, Modern Hotel with great service.","No problems during our 2 night stay at The Croke Park, the room was very nice and spacious with all the amenities you'd expect from a 4 stat hotel. Breakfast was very nice with good prompt friendly service and lots of choice.

We even visited their sister hotel, The Westbury for afternoon tea.

We would definitely stop here again, good value for money and great service.",5,2015,12,12
211,Great Hotel,"After shoddy Ryanair treatment, cancelling flights last minute, it was great to arrive at this hotel, great atmosphere, food and service. A short drive to city centre, the value for money was great. The breakfast was very good, although there was queue that morning. The food quality in the restaurant was excellent and service in all areas couldn't be faulted.
",4,2015,12,12
211,Perfect stay,"The room was ready in the morning and was a large room with a nice bathroom. We had a inside facing room, but that was no problem at all. The only note for the room is that the television was quite small. The staff at the reception is nice and helpful. The lobby and the corridors were really nice and fresh. The breakfast was good not special compared to other hotels. A lot of times there were items missing at the breakfast buffet, but the staff was not that fast with replacing this even tough they were with a lot. 
The neighbourhood is not that impressive but it close to the centre.",5,2015,12,12
211,Check out The Croke Park Hotel before booking anywhere else!!,"My special needs daughter and I take a break in Dublin a couple of times a year.  After an initial misunderstanding by us with regards to our full package price, the staff were very professional and customer focused with their resolution.  All staff are very friendly and provide exceptional service, endeavouring to make your stay a pleasure.  Thank you very much guys.  You will always be our first port of call when visiting Dublin. We hope you all have a happy and healthy festive season.",5,2015,12,11
211,"Second Visit, I Still Love This Hotel","We had our 2nd stay of the year at The Croke Park and enjoyed it just as much as the first. The staff are all so friendly & helpful. The rooms are lovely. Bathrooms fittings and bathroom shampoo, gels etc are all really nice quality. Towels so thick they fight back when you fold them. We got a great price on the room with breakfast which meant our taxis to & from the centre could be budgeted into our stay. Breakfast was so good and such a calm atmosphere, it was lovely. Great quality breakfast food including fresh fruits, honeycomb, Danish etc. I'll visit again.",5,2015,12,11
211,As good as the other reviews indicate,"When I read the reviews for this hotel and booked it for a mini break in Dublin, I was sceptical about how good it was actually going to be.I was therefore delighted to find that it is every bit as good as we had hoped. From checking in to checking out the whole stay was excellent. Every single member of staff is helpful and friendly, always smiling. The place is spotless and the food really good. We chose to upgrade, and the facilities and 'extras' that we got far outweighed any additional cost. If I return to Dublin at anytime I would stay there again and would recommend without hesitation.",5,2015,12,11
211,Easily a 5 star hotel.,"We were staying there as my girlfriend was doing an exam in Croke Park the next day. We were lucky enough to be upgraded to the Liam MacCarthy suite and it was amazing. It was particularly handy to have a separate room so she could study with adequate desk space and without any noise. The executive lounge was a lovely space to unwind later in the evening and we cud relax and read the paper and enjoy a juice. 
The staff are really welcoming and make you feel like you are their top priority.
The bar is a lovely place to enjoy a drink and also boasts a mouth watering bar menu. We had the fish and chips and seafood chowder, both of which were amazing. As my girlfriend put it ""Oh my god, the chowder, mmmmmmmmm""
We will definitely be staying there again.

211,"fabulous hotel, excellent staff with their can do will do attitude","the friendlies staff I have ever met in any hotel, from the checkin staff to the cleaners and restaurant staff everyone went out of their way for me.
Lovely hotel fabulous rooms just wish I could have stayed longer. Did not want to get out of the bed as it was so comfy",5,2015,12,10
211,Fantastic Hotel!,"So me & my 2 friends Stayed here for 2 nights on a weekend. We were on a girly weekend for a night out in Dublin. 

When we arrived we were given our keys and went straight to the room. It was really nice. Very clean. Fresh towels, shampoo etc all supplied. Iron and ironing board also supplied. Hair dryer was also in the room. The bathroom was lovely and clean and the shower was great. 

The hotel itself was very modern and I couldnt fault the cleanliness. We didnt actually eat or use the bar as we were always our exploring Dublin. But im sure the bar etc was nice. 

I would highly reccomend the Green Bus Tour (hop on hop off it was great) also the guiness factory is a must :-)

I would highly reccomend this hotel!",5,2015,12,09
211,best hotel by far,"My wife and I usually stay in the Croke Park hotel 4 or 5 times a year every year.  We would not dream of staying anywhere else when we visit the city of Dublin.  You will have no worries staying here as everything is as near perfect as you can get in a hotel.
Rooms are large and extremely comfortable as are the bathrooms.  Breakfast is superb and delicious, served in nice surroundings.  We usually only eat bar food here, but it is beautiful as well.
Front desk staff, bar staff, waiters and waitresses are all a credit to this superbly run hotel.  You do not need to read endless reviews for this hotel, just go ahead and book it, you will certainly not be disappointed.
My wife and I will be back on 19th December and again on 3rd January, when I will have no doubt that we will be looked after in the usual professional and most efficient manner by all the staff there.  I cannot rate this hotel highly enough, so don’t delay just book it.",5,2015,12,09
211,excellent hotel,"had a two night stay ,front of house staff were very helpful as were all the staff we met ,the rooms are spotless and to a good standard ,breakfast was good with loads of choice and the bar is very good as well,we would us this hotel again no problem and it is a ten mins stroll into town.",5,2015,12,08
211,Wonderful service and attention to detail. ,"Wonderful experience, great beds and fabulous service. It's a bit of the tourist path but well worth it. Hop on bus right outside so easily able to get to hot spots. The staff could not do enough. 
I highly recommend this place. If you're interested in a great value thus hotel is it.

211,GOLD MEADL,"The Croke Park Hotel is the gold medal of Dublin hotels,it has that touch of class about it,from senior staff to the chambermaids,they all treat you like a star,have stayed there on numerous occasions and it just gets better,try it you wont be sorry,the buzz is great",5,2015,12,08
211,Love it here,"What a great hotel, on arrival we were given bottled water and hot face cloths to freshen up, our room is beautiful, with a balcony, we received a bottle of complimentary wine as its a special occassion. They cant do enough for you, fantastic service. 😆",5,2015,12,08
211,Great quality hotel,"Just come back from a two night stay with my boyfriend - very nice hotel, spotlessly clean, modern rooms, very quiet, strong wifi, faultlessly friendly and helpful service. It's about a half hour walk to temple bar, or a €10 taxi - we did both. You can also pick up the hop on hop off bus from about ten minutes walk away. 

I have only one gripe- which is that on the Sunday morning we queued for half an hour to get into breakfast... I have never queued to get into a hotel buffet breakfast before! I would guess that part of the problem was that a lot of people (us included) came down towards the end of the breakfast window- although I can't believe that's unusual for a weekend. This was then made worse by the staff being unable to keep up, clear tables or seat people quickly. Once we got in it was apparent that there were lots of free tables, but the staff were just overwhelmed. One point to work on!

Otherwise, a really lovely stay and would highly recommend the hotel.",4,2015,12,07
211,Fantastic!,"The hotel is beautiful, very plush. Directly across the road from Croke Park, it was exactly what we were looking for! The room was comfortable, clean and decadent. Very clean bathroom. Overall, very satisfied.

211,"Professional, comfortable and easy",I stayed here for business and was pleasantly surprised at the warm welcome and the ease of which everything was carried out from arrival to departure.  Nothing was too much trouble and requests were carried out with a smile.  Yes I will be returning to this hotel. Thank you.,5,2015,12,05

211,Comfortable luxury,"Having just spent 2 nights at this hotel was really impressed.  Spacious rooms, soft fluffy white towels, separate bath and shower facility excellent breakfast and all round service.  Cannot recommend it highly enough.  First ever time had a recliner in my room. Only problem is 10 walk from city centre.",5,2015,12,04

211,Ideal family hotel ,"Stayed in December , loved the hotel  , staff and food couldn't fault a thing. Had our 3 year old with us , he loved it , there was even a fridge   In the room , handy for his yogurts and drinks , short ride to the city centre in a taxi , ideal location , will be returning ",5,2015,12,04
211,Almost perfect,"Stayed one night at Croke Park Hotel prior to flying out.  Room was excellent with air conditioning, a proper weight for a blanket, and a clean bathroom with big heavyweight towels and a delightful shower.  They even provided a complimentary cocktail that evening.  Included an underground car park, which was another major plus.  No complaints so far.  But the reception desk service was lukewarm and, most damaging, the coffee machine broke and they did not provide a carafe with coffee as a substitute.",5,2015,12,03
211,Great hotel but far. ...,"The hotel and it's services are great.  Clean, helpful staff, spacious rooms, I had fresh fruit and water every day placed in my room. 
The problem is the location. It is around 15 minutes walk to the spire.  The town centre And this is adult walking.
Also single women may  not feel that it's a nice area to walk around late at night on your own. 

on the other hand a taxi will cost around 10 euro and get you there in 5 minutes. 

Be aware that in the morning it can take up to 20 minutes to get a taxi to come to the hotel so make sure to pre book it the night before.

211,Very comfortable stay,"Stayed here for two nights; excellent hotel, spotlessly clean, fresh towels each day; excellent choice of food, good breakfast, all staff were friendly, courteous and very helpful. On checking out the staff member offered me complimentary water for my journey- lovely touch. ",5,2015,12,03
211,Lovely Dublin Stay,"We stayed in Croke Park Hotel after seeing the reviews on TripAdvisor and we were very happy with our stay! The hotel was great; spacious, clean rooms with comfortable beds. The service from the staff was always attentive, helpful and they gave good tips on what to do in Dublin when we asked for them. The breakfast selection had good choice and staff were again very attentive.

The hotel is a little way out of the city centre but with our travel pass it wasn't a problem to get in and out and it was well worth it for staying in such a great place. There was a shuttle that ran from the hotel to the hop on hop off bus in the morning which was helpful for travel too.

211,Superb as always,"Stayed for the weekend of the Aussie rules, fantastic service from start to finish. Are Friday night in the restaurant and was lovely. Bar food looked fab too.

211,This is a beautiful Hotel,"Stayed for 3 days at Croke Park  it is a beautiful hotel, with excellent staff, and breakfast is to die for. If anyone is going to Dublin for the Christmas markets they are down at the Docks, some how the locals don't seem to know where they are being held. It is worth getting a Hop on Hop off bus (green one) it cost 17 euros for 2 day tickets but well worth it, as we spent a lot of time visiting the sights, the prison is well worth seeing very interesting cost 4 euros and takes about 1 hour the cafe there has the most delicious cakes. Phoenix Park is worth a ride on the bus you can see the deer's they where up very close to the bus. When arriving at the airport just go outside and the drivers of the buses will tell you which one to get on it seems to cost 6 euros to go where you want to go in Dublin. believe 35 euros for taxi's but they are on meters so may be less or more depending on where you are going. Hope this help everyone    ",5,2015,12,02
211,Nice Visit,"I enjoyed our stay here. Great service and even though there was a game that weekend, it was generally quite. the only downside is the distance from activities. fine for a short walk to O'Connell and Henry Streets  but cabbed it otherwise",4,2015,12,02
211,Short. Stay in Ireland,"Just back from a 2 night stay in Dublin at The Croke Park Hotel. The hotel was excellent, beautifully presented, the rooms were spacious, the beds really comfortable, the bathroom with bath and walk in shower lovely. All the staff were friendly and did everything they could to make us comfortable and welcome. Sky TV, free WIFI, free safe in room. Breakfasts all you could wish for and if it wasnt there they would make it. Very pleasnat bar area and snacks available. We didnt eat in the restaurant as we wanted to sample other places too, would recommend to anyone",5,2015,12,01
211,Nice hotel it but...,"This is a nice mid range hotel.  When we reached the hotel our rooms were ready and since they new from the"" get to know you questionnaire"" they sent when we booked that we were celebrating my friends birthday they left some complementary prosecco. That was nice.  The rooms were spacious and well appointed.  The bathroom had both a tub and a shower. From our rooms were just looking out at roof tops other rooms may have a better view.  When it comes to location this hotel loses a point for me.  Its right across from Croke Park Stadium so if your going to a game staying here is a good idea but know that its about 15-30 minutes away from the main attractions.  And there is not much in the way of food around the hotel.  I would still be ok with that but the area surrounding the hotel was not the best and some of the areas we walked through to get back to the hotel were worst.  After the first night we just took a taxi when we  wanted to go back to the hotel both in the day and the night.  Location is the only reason I would not stay here again,",4,2015,11,30
211,A Business Hotel and then some,"We stayed here for a weekend away. The price was very good and included breakfast and parking. The reception was bright and airy and the staff very welcoming. When we went up to our floor we were amazed at the number of rooms. Yet our room was quiet and spotless. Let me say that again. It was spotless. 
Breakfast was a hot buffet which is my least favourite thing in the world. There were plenty of staff and the containers of food were replaced regularly and someone always seemed to be checking to make sure nothing had got cold so that was good. 
The free car-parking is a huge deal. We could have walked to Dublin city in 10 minutes but drove. 
All in all we'll stay there again. 
We were slightly surprised that given that it's next door to Croke Park there wasn't more made of the GAA. A distinct lack of photos or memorabilia
",5,2015,11,30
211,Fantastic Hotel.,"We stayed here for two nights to celebrate my wife's 50th birthday.Can't speak highly enough about the service and standard of the Croke Park Hotel.We had in total about 36 guests with us and everyone of them loved it.The staff were lovely and very helpful and nothing was a bother to them.
The food was of the highest standard from breakfast to dinner and other hotels should take note of how this Hotel is managed and maintained.
We will definitely be back and this has become our destination hotel when we visit Dublin again.",5,2015,11,30
211,"Clean, modern, comfortable hotel. Friendly professional staff","My wife and I stayed at the hotel for one night while attending an event in Dublin. Price wise it is about average for Dublin prices. However, I would say it is a step above most of the other hotels in the price range. 

There is free parking, the reception staff are friendly and professional. Had a snack in the hotel bar (along with a complementary drink) which was reasonably priced and very good.  

The rooms are tastefully decorated, very clean and modern. Also there is an executive lounge which you can access 24 hours per day, here you can get tea, coffee and snacks. Also, you can have your buffet breakfast here also (overlooking Croke park stadium). 

Overall, a very present stay and definitely recommended.",5,2015,11,30

211,Great if you are going to a match/concert,"Stayed here, in November
There was a mix up with reception
The card keys to the room kept working and not working, so numerous trips back to reception to change it, including trying to check out!
Only one lift to the basement carpark and there is NO stairs to it!
Well if there is, staff at reception don't know about them!!
The room was nice, but very noisy road!!
Breakfast was ok, a little cold!
Carpark very tight, for a saloon car!! 
Handy for a match or a concert!

211,Food Allergy not handled well....,"Nice enough hotel, young staff are lovely, but food allergy is certainly not handled well... I have a nut allergy, and was attending a Christmas Dinner function... The hotel was told in advance of the allergy, but made no effort to deal with it... It was very much a case of ""You can't have the bread, you can't have the stuffing, you can't have the gravy"", but absolutely no alternative was offered!... I was AGES waiting for my 'meal' and I use that word loosely... By the time my meal arrived, everyone else was ninety percent through theirs, and the turkey and ham was cold... Thankfully, I asked for fresh veg., because by the time my food arrived, the veg served was cold... The only thing that was good was the three roast potatoes served with my food... To be fair, because the mince pies weren't nut free, I was served a passionfruit pannacotta... I was VERY disappointed... The hotel was advised in advance... It's not like I just turned up... It's not THAT hard to provide good food to people with food allergy... I understand that the food is good IF you don't have food allergy!.... I hope that this is a one-off, and that there's usually better understanding of dietary restrictions... I'm not sure I'd waste my money on a return visit to find out, though!....",2,2015,11,28

All in all a first class hotel.",5,2015,11,28

The hotel have presented us with some prosecco to celebrate as a surprise. Our first impressions are that the hotel is really friendly and nice. The rooms are very large with 2 double beds in and the bathroom has separate bath and shower. We walked from Dublin to the hotel today which is a bit of a hike especially in the rain so from now on its taxis. We would definitely recommend this hotel we would also like to say a really big thank you to the hotel for the lovely gift.,5,2015,11,27
211,On door step of Croke park. Too expensive,"Lovely modern hotel. Stayed here for a concert at Croke Park. Hotel is right on door step of Croke Park and 10 minute walk into city centre.
Didn't eat at hotel but had breakfast following morning which was lovely.
Underground parking which is a bonus for a city hotel. 
A lovely hotel but a bit too expensive for all it offers. Unless you want direct easy access to Croke park",4,2015,11,27

211,The only hotel I've ever stayed in that feels like home.,"This is a superb hotel, with superb facilities unless a pool is a 'must have' for your stay. Ten minutes walk will bring you to the city centre and its 10 minutes drive from the airport. Parking is ample and free. Breakfast is simply superb, lots of choices and excellent food quality. Rooms are spacious and beds are incredibly comfortable. The secret of the Croke Park, however is the staff. Wonderfully friendly and nothing is any trouble. As a team, they would be top of their division and they make every stay a real pleasure. ",5,2015,11,26
211,My lady's birthday,"Well we booked Croke Park Hotel at a last minute decision a week or so before staying there for four nights on 19th November. 

The occasion was my lady's birthday and as it was her first time visiting Dublin, I wanted it to be enjoyable.

 Normally I always stay South of the river so this was a first for me also. I could not have picked a better place to stay.

 Though some of the negative reviews about the place on trip advisor were a little off putting, I proceded to book our stay there regardless. 
I honestly think that some of the negative reviewers writing some of the (what I consider rubbish) about Croke Park Hotel, didn't stay in the same Croke Park Hotel where I stayed. 

From the moment I phoned them to make the reservation I was dealt with efficient, polite and helpful staff. 

When we arrived on the 19th we were greeted with the warm smile and pleasant manner of Janelle on reception. Our booking was confirmed and we were speedily dealt with and handed our room keys without the need of time consuming paper work, so often the case in other hotels at a time when one doesn't need it ( i.e. after a journey,) other than the security of a credit card details and the handing over to us of four free drinks vouchers each to be used at the bar. Which ever way you look at it, that's €40 off the bill. Or in our case €50 because when we tried to redeem two vouchers on the evening of my lady's birthday, we were told by the restaurant manager, to keep them for later and the drinks were on himself. A kind gesture which all helped to the enjoyment of our stay.

We entered our room and were extremely satisfied with what we found. 

More than spacious enough for our four nights stay. Extremely clean and tidy. King size bed with crisp white linen and plenty of  soft pillows. 
The room had a television, writing desk, separate small dining table, tea/coffee making facilities, mini fridge, a safe, more than enough wardrobe space, trousers press , hair dryer, no less than three telephones, one bedside, one on the desk and one in the bathroom. Complimentary  bath robes and slippers, plenty of clean fluffy white towels and  flannels.  Fully stocked bathroom with shampoo, conditioner , shower gell, body lotion, mending kit, vanity kit, shoe polishing mit, shower caps . Nothing was forgotten. Writing implements on the desk in a cosy very quiet room on the fourth floor, that wasn't stuffy and too warm, as is with too many hotel rooms I've stayed in. A temperature climate control was on the wall for those who might prefer it warmer. Oh! two half bottles of presecco and two glasses awaited our arrival, on the house. An ice dispenser was just down the hallway.

The breakfast had all we wanted as we're not ones for full cooked breakfasts, though full cooked breakfasts were there to be had should you want it. We had a choice of cereals, toast, yoghurt , delicious honeycomb honey, croissants with or without chocolate, assorted bread rolls, fruit , smoked salmon, cold meats and cheeses ,  butter and assorted jams and marmalade. Tea coffee and hot chocolate, orange juice , milk and bottled water.

We decided to eat in the restaurant in the birthday night of the 20th and were looked after by the ever friendly attentive, but not over the top,  restaurant staff.  Those and the charming restaurant manager, who's name escapes me but certainly deserves a mention, made it a thoroughly enjoyable evening.  Food I should add was delicious. Expertly cooked and very good value for money.

All the staff we encountered were friendly and helpful at all times and never without a smile. 

It will be the only place I'll stay for future visits to this wonderful entertaining city as its situation is only a nice walk of approximately one mile to O'Connell street and the center of Dublin. Taxis in abundance if you're lazy. 

Oh! a plus also for would be car hire folks is, virtually next door is Enterprise car hire. We used them and found them to be fine.

211,Helpful attentive staff - very comfortable ,"Stayed for a U2 concert at the 3Arena. Only 10 minutes drive to the car park at the venue (a little bit more on the way back afterwards). 

Helpful staff at reception who helped print tickets. 

Well appointed room and a nice breakfast which was available early. ",5,2015,11,25
211,Great Weekend in the Croke Park Hotel,"We had a great weekend in the Croke Park Hotel. Great breakfasts with plenty of choice. Dined in the Bar on night one and opted for the burger meal. Very enjoyable, good value and exceeded our expectations. On night 2 we dined in the restaurant and opted for the dinner menu. The food was top class with excellent choices. I would highly recommend this hotel for a weekend or mid week stay. The reception staff and restaurant staff were very pleasant to deal with and most helpful. Finally, great parking available if you have a car.",5,2015,11,25
211,Excellent Hotel,"We have just returned from a very enjoyable two night stay at the Croke Park Hotel. The hotel is well located for visiting Dublin City centre - we used the bus from Drumcondra Road which is about a five minute walk away. We also used a taxi from O'Connell Street back to the hotel which cost a very reasonable seven euro.
The hotel itself is excellent with complimentary underground parking for guests, free Wi-Fi and, for members of the hotel group's loyalty scheme, free bottled water and a daily newspaper. A complimentary cup of hot chocolate was also provided as part of our bed and breakfast package. We ate in the side line bar on both nights and the food was very good, well presented and reasonable. We found all the staff throughout the hotel to be extremely helpful and friendly from the moment we arrived until we left. We thought that it was also an unusual but very nice touch to be given warn flannels on arrival to freshen up!
We would certainly have no hesitation in staying here when visiting Dublin again or recommending this hotel to friends.",5,2015,11,25
211,Very good hotel,"Croke Park Hotel is not far away from city centre of Dublin. 20 minute walk to Temple bar, or 5 minut to the nearest bus station. Very clean, comfortable rooms,stuff kind. Breakfast not included in price. Costs extra 15€. Near hotel is legendary Croke Stadium with guided tours.",4,2015,11,25
211,The only safe bet at Croke Park,"Stayed here in October to attend a conference at Croke Park, the location was amazing I couldn't have been any closer unless I slept on the pitch!
The hotel itself is beautiful and had great facilities.  I was staying on a night that Ireland were playing in the rugby World Cup so there was a great atmosphere about the place particularly the bar and restaurant.  The restaurant was lovely and myself and my colleagues had a beautiful dinner and then a few drinks in the bar.  I'm sure the atmosphere isn't usually as good but the place was really busy and very lively.  
The rooms are beautiful and very spacious, I particularly liked the size of the bathrooms and the tea and coffee facilities in the room.
Breakfast the next morning was lovely with a very wide selection of food to cater for all tastes and a nice hot cappuccino to wash it all down.
Another plus was the free wifi which always helps when your away.  If I was going to Croke Park I would definately stay here but otherwise it's a bit far out from the town.
Overall I had a great stay and the staff as well were very helpful ensuring that my taxi etc was all booked and ready for me to catch my train.",4,2015,11,23
211,Business trip to Dublin - your home away from home,"Lovely Hotel not too far away from Eastpoint Business Park where I was working. It is however a tad outside Dublin main city centre so a cab is always required to and forth and is around €7 one way. The Hotel offer a courtesy shuttle bus to the business park which is a great benefit and service, driver helpful and you book at concierge. Pick up is at allotted time. Food in Restaurant and bar is good but if you are there more than a few days you will want to go out for a change; as there is not much in and around th hotel other than the stadium, you will need to cab it. I found that if the hotel has hospitality events in their meeting rooms off the side of the bar and private functions in the lounge, the bar is full as people overspill and so finding a seat was not possible on one of my nights last week. Restaurant staff are very helpful and the breakfasts were  very good (albeit they use cheap frozen sausages - could do better quality than Walls Bangers). Rooms fitted out well and comfortable. Gym was good and a plus as they have some free weights. Would be good if they invested in a set of Kettle Bells and TRX straps off the wall - many of us hate the machines. 
if you are in and out all the time - this is a great base for business and for pleasure. If you want to walk into town, its a bit out of the way for that - can is not much. Share and its cheaper.",4,2015,11,23
211,"COMFORTABLE, CLEAN, FRIENDLY.","This hotel is the only place to stay on match day.

211,Surprisingly nice hotel,"Frankly, I wasn't expecting much from a hotel directly across the street from a football stadium, but Croke Park Hotel surprised me. We stayed on the executive club level. The bathroom was huge, with separate shower (excellent!) and tub. Bed was terrific and wi-fi was fast and reliable. Many little amenities in the room, including free bottled water, and the executive lounge had a decent (not fantastic) breakfast buffet selection and good coffee. The lobby bistro had a good menu and fast service, though it seemed fairly huge and impersonal. As I said, the location gave me pause, but we were heading to the airport early and it turned out to be just a short hop. I would stay here again, though for touring Dublin I prefer to be closer to St. Stephens Green.",4,2015,11,22
211,Great trip,Gary was awesome. He took care of us with our early arrival and we were able to get some food and check in early to get a short nap before heading out for the day.

211,Good hotel but needs a bit of TLC and to ditch the piped music,"The hotel has good rooms, nice bathrooms and pleasant staff.  However, there were 2 issues.  The seating in the bar was ripped and some of the tables looked as if they had seen better days.  The other issue was more serious.  The hotel plays piped music 24/7 and it kept me awake all night.  I was in a room on the first floor and could not escape it.  I woke at 3 am and thought I had tinnitus until I realised what it was.  I didn't call reception because, at that time, I just wanted to try to get back to sleep but sooner than expected, it was 6am.  This really did spoil an otherwise pleasant stay",4,2015,11,18
211,Fantastic hotel with warm friendly staff,"Stayed here last week for my daughter's graduation, on arrival the greeting was warm and friendly, we were upgraded to the Executive floor as it was my daughter's graduation and we had completed a questionnaire about our stay from the hotel - in the room there was 2 bottles of Prosecco and a card for my daughter, it really made the stay for us, thank you all.
We had drinks in the busy bar, again staff could not have been nicer.
Breakfast was very good, I love this hotel and will come back again.",5,2015,11,18
211,Perfect visit,"We stayed in the executive suite for 2 nights as a birthday present, and our stay couldn't have been made better. The staff we spoke to were always very polite and friendly, and the room was absolutely immaculate. The bathroom was stocked with the usual toiletries, and we had both a bath and a shower. The view from the room looked straight at the Croke Park Stadium (much to my boyfriend's delight), and the hotel was only a 10 minute taxi/20 minute walk from the town centre. I didn't hear a single thing on both nights, and the black-out curtains meant I accidentally had a fantastic nights sleep. I couldn't recommend this hotel enough and would definitely visit again if I was in the area. Thank you for a perfect birthday trip :)",5,2015,11,17
211,Excellent!,"Went to the Eirtakon Anime Convention and chose Croke Park Hotel because it was so close to the event. The Hotel staff were very friendly and didn't mind us walking around the hotel in costume! We are so grateful! The food fro the Sideline Bistro was amazing!!!! Everything we saw tasted unbelievable and kept us going for the weekend. Personally I thought the price of the room was fine, I'd pay it again no problem for the sheer helpfulness of the staff, great food and really nice room! Thanks, see ya next year!!! ",5,2015,11,17
211,Great Hotel,"Booked this hotel for my 25th, great location, very nice hotel, lovely rooms at affordable prices. All the staff are very helpful and polite. Wouldn't stay anywhere else when visiting Dublin.Thank you for a great trip.",5,2015,11,17
211,Dublin delight,"Stayed a Monday night, so the hotel was quiet. From arrival to departure, all was as expected of a 4 star hotel and interaction with staff felt supportive. For example, upon booking in we were offered hot flannels to refresh - a nice touch. Car parking on site (underground) was perfect and with only being a short distance to the city centre a taxi was cheap, though walking is an option weather dependant. The room and other facilities were plush and well presented. Breakfast was great, hot food and continental selections, as well as fast service at table. If returning to Dublin we would look to stay here again, so we'll done Croke Park Hotel.",5,2015,11,17
211,Great Stay!,"I booked this hotel months ago by location in Dublin.  Not having been there before, I wasn't sure where to stay but we only had 28 hours and I knew we wanted to be near city center.  It was directly across the street from the Stadium which was cool and would have been a great place to see if we had more time.  The hotel was great, clean and very comfortable for our one night.  The staff was friendly and helpful; we enjoyed the tea and cookies in our room.  Nice big bathroom, great lighting and offered every amenity one could possibly need while visiting.  We enjoyed the delicious traditional Irish Breakfast Buffet  before departing to the airport.  We would definitely stay again; it was walking distance to the train and Temple Bar and still close enough to the airport.  ",5,2015,11,16
211,Best stay ever!,"We stayed here last week for my daughter's graduation, during the week before check in I received a questionnaire about our visit, the purpose of the visit etc.  this I duly answered and was delighted to see that we were upgraded to the Executive level, we had a gorgeous room, huge bathroom, very comfortable bed and all luxuries you could want and in the room was a note for my daughter congratulating her on her graduation and 2 bottles of Prosecco.  I found the staff to be polite, warm, smiling and so helpful during our stay.  The attention to detail was overwhelming, I cannot wait until my next time I am lucky enough to stay in this truly fabulous hotel.",5,2015,11,16
211,Great Hotel,Lovely hotel very close to Dublin city. Family rooms are ample with two double beds and a single with the option of a further single pull out. The hotel is very clean and the staff are very friendly and professional. My only negative comment is directed at the very large tv which was constantly on in the bar area and which seemed to be broadcasting Sky news continually.,4,2015,11,16
211,Lovely hotel,"Had a lovely stay, rooms immaculate, fabulous breakfast, staff were helpful, location good for a concert ar 3 Arena, pretty good for city center too, only issue was bar and restaurant a little expensive 
      
      ",5,2015,11,15
211,Memorable stay,"Lovely hotel, lovely food and just fantastic friendly staff. Will certainly be back.
      
      Great location for access to city centre, warm and friendly atmosphere and staff were so helpful, huge bonus of free parking.",5,2015,11,13
211,"Wonderful hotel, very impressive, unfortunately not in wonderful location...","Beautiful reception area, wonderful rooms, very comfortable bed, luxurious bathroom. Extremely quiet at night. Excellent breakfast with fantastic range of food. Daily paper supplied. Only low point is of course the location. Very dodgy area around hotel. Safe to walk into town in a group but not alone. However taxi fare is only €6.60 from O'Connell Street to hotel. Alternately get a bus to Dorset Street - Drumcondra and walk down Clonliffe Road.",5,2015,11,13
211,Always happy,"I stay in this hotel on a regular basis for work purposes, and am always made feel very welcome, given the benefits of being in a Loyalty programme, and generally hit the road again feeling recharged. Always a pleasant stay.",5,2015,11,13
211,Great service and nice rooms,"We loved the Croke Park Hotel.  From check in, to breakfast, lunch and dinner at the hotel restaurant, everyone was helpful and friendly.  

The hotel is right across from Croke Park Stadium and there was a major GAA event tournament happening on one of the days; lots of fans.  The hotel bar/restaurant was very busy but still super helpful and friendly.  Lots of fun.

Our room was large, clean and comfortable.  We hopped on the Hop On/Hop Off bus tour right at the front entrance of the hotel.  Only a short ride into Dublin downtown.  

I highly recommend the Croke Park Hotel.",5,2015,11,12
211,Great place!,"Stayed here for 3 nights for my birthday. Couldn't have asked for more. Was upgraded and given drink vouchers for my birthday which was lovely. The hotel is great, was clean, service spot on and well worth 5 stars. Had a nice bar and a fabulous restaurant with probably the best steak I've EVER had so make sure you check it out. I guess if there's one draw back it's it's location, it's a good 15 minute walk into the main centre of Dublin but if you enjoy walking like us it was no problem, they do run a bus at certain times though. All in all if your looking for a hotel to stay in Dublin then look no further, you won't regret it. ",5,2015,11,12
211,Wonderful Stay,"My wife and I recently visited Ireland for the first time. Our first stay was at the Croke Park Hotel. The place has a comfortable feel and reasonable rates. As tourists, it was nice that it's right across the street from the impressive Croke Stadium. However, once we became somewhat familiar with Dublin, we wished we had stayed closer to the center of town. Not a bad taxi ride to the Temple Bar area, about €10 - €13 depending on where you wanted to go in that area. We had the Irish breakfasts with our package and the food was spot on and delicious. ",4,2015,11,12
211,Friendly Staff & Good Customer Service,"I've stayed at the Croke Park Hotel a few times and I've always come out the door satisfied with the overall experience. On our recent stay we were greeted with a complementary bottle of Prosecco to celebrate our Anniversary. Nice touch!

I always find this hotel is good value for money. The room was spacious and clean. Double Beds were not very big but very comfortable. The iPhone/iPad docking station was useful although it does not fit the newer iPhone connections. Bathroom was well equipped with toiletries. There was a cracked tile(missing a corner) near the shower but I forgot to inform staff upon checkout. 

Our room package included a delicious hot chocolate for each of us and this was delivered to the room upon request (without any additional charge). Breakfast was nice (Full Irish, cereals, breads, fruit). Hotel was busy with business travelers as it was mid-week break.",4,2015,11,12
211,Slick hotel,"Our recent stay got the thumbs up from all our family. Very nice room, easy car parking, great breakfast, great helpful staff and a nice Guinness. Good location close to the city centre but it's maybe better to use a taxi at night. Longside Croke Park which is a must to visit if you have a spare couple of hours. I often use this hotel on business as well and they have great bar food.",4,2015,11,11
211,Great hotel,"We stayed here for 2 nights from 27th to 29th October celebrating my partners birthday and had a wonderful time . The hotel is in a great location , not to far from the city centre and right opposite Croke Park. Every member of staff was polite and friendl , without being intrusive.  The room was comfortable with all mod cons and the bathroom was huge with a big shower and bath. The staff left a couple of complimentary bottles for the missus birthday and our friends wife as well. A lovely touch. The breakfast is not to be missed and was help yourself with a large selection on offer to suite all tastes. Special mention to the lady who cleaned our room and left all our clothes neatly folded , we salute you.
Would highly recommend this hotel and will definitely return.",5,2015,11,10
211,Amazing stay,"We stayed at the Croke Park for my husbands birthday and couldn't have asked for better service. 

We flew very early after only 4 hours sleep and to our joy they had our room ready for us when we checked in at 8am - meaning we could grab a few more hours sleep before hitting the city! 

The room was spacious, well appointed, clean and really comfy. The bathroom was huge and spotlessly clean. 

To top it off, the staff provided a couple of little bottles of prosecco to help celebrate my husbands birthday! A great surprise and lovely touch. 

Yes it's a bit further out of the city, but only a 10 minute walk to O'Connell street and €10 in a taxi. 

Highly recommended. ",5,2015,11,10
211,Beautiful Hotel,"We stayed for 2 nights for a Dublin stopover prior to flying home and were very well looked after. The rooms are spacious, although if you overlook the inside courtyard, it does get noisy as this is the bar smoking area. You are a little bit out of town (20 minutes walk from O'Connell Street) but the airport is easy to reach as you avoid most of the Dublin traffic. A local cab to the airport is 16 euros so avoid the hotel transfer facility. The Italian bistro 2 minutes walk from the hotel is excellent and highly recommended.",4,2015,11,09
211,One night in Superior double room,"I Chose this hotel as it was the first listed on Tripadvisor and it was good proximity from Dublin centre (15 min walk).

All of the staff were pleasant and helpful, foyer has a good layout, bar is nice along with good food.

The room was in good condition and clean. We also had breakfast included  which was good quality too. Car parking was included in our room price too- so we parked our hire car at no extra cost...

The room was very reasonably priced and I would definately stay here again- exactly how a hotel should be run. ",5,2015,11,09
211,Surprisingly great,"The hotel is lovely,  nice food,  really nice and rooms spacious,  would stay again. We did the croke park tour which was superb,  great educational tour for adults and children. its a 10 min walk to town. ",5,2015,11,08
211,Beautiful hotel,"We stayed for just one night (husbands suprise birthday trip to Dublin) at the Croke Park Hotel and I must say we both found all aspects of the hotel to be superb. Lovely friendly and professional staff, faultless. Clean, cosy and very comfy room all to a high standard. Bistro dinner was perfect, as was continental breakfast, lots of choice of well presented food. Would highly recommended the hotel for a Dublin stay and would definitely visit again. Thank you Croke Park Hotel, we were impressed with your hospitality.",5,2015,11,07
211,Lovely warm welcome for our anniversary ,"Me and my husband visited the hotel on Tuesday for a one night stay, we received a very warm welcome from the front desk offered warm towels to freshen up, I had emailed ahead and asked for a room with a nice view, which sadly this hotel does not have but that's with no fault of its own, out first room faced the stadium which was abit naff but when we went to reception Janel  was more than happy to move us to a room over viewing the river, having been in the room about an hour we had a knock at the door with 2 mini bottles of prosecco and a card saying happy anniversary  which I thought was a very nice touch.
We went to the bar for a few cocktails later that evening and it had a very cosy  feeling, we were served my a man called Phil who was very happy to tell us all the places to go in temple bar, 
The breakfast was great too and coffee was lovely, all in all the hotel was lovely and the staff were great x thank you for making our anniversary lovely xx",5,2015,11,05
211,"Friendly, inviting and excellent value for money","We landed in Dublin at 09:00 and had requested an early check in. We arrived at the hotel at 10.15 hoping to just be able to drop our bags off, only to find that they had organised a room for us. A great start. The staff were friendly and engaging, the room comfortable and spacious, the exec area (open 24/7) a great perk for stocking up on water, juice and pastries, and the food in the bar was excellent too. They couldn't do enough for us. A very impressive hotel and we would use it as a base again for future visits to Ireland",5,2015,11,03
211,Was expecting more,"We stayed to celebrate our anniversary and to meet up with a few friends and have a night out. Check in was robotic we didn't feel that welcome. 
Room seemed tired and a bit dated.
Service in bar was horrendous. Six staff stood at the end of the counter talking away amongst themselves - had to get up and get our own drinks.
Breakfast staff grumpy and uninterested. 
On check out were never asked how was our stay.
Felt we had paid well over the odds for an average hotel.",2,2015,11,02
211,"Fantastic, modern, friendly hotel","I booked this hotel for a 3 night stay based on Trip Advisor reviews so it is always interesting to find out if it lives up to its reputation. I am really pleased to say that the Croke Park Hotel definitely does!

We booked a deluxe room with Queen bed and this also gave us access to the executive lounge on the top floor. The lounge has complimentary tea & coffee, juice, fruit and biscuits as well as comfy sofas, flat screen TV and a continental breakfast in the mornings. 

Check in was carried out by extremely friendly staff who were working under pressure as their computer system was down and they were trying to work 'blind'. Despite this Janel was extremely professional and arranged for us to have some coffee in the reception while we waiting for the room. The room itself was lovely although not a Queen room (it had a single and double bed). We decided not to query this as the poor staff were already under stress and it wasn't really an issue. There were slippers, robes and iPod dock in the room and the bathroom was huge with a separate bath and shower enclosure. 

As we had arrived mid afternoon we decided to take a walk into Dublin and Krishna the concierge was really helpful in providing maps and advice. As other reviewers have stated the hotel is not in the centre of Dublin and is a good 20 minute walk to the heart of the action. This did not prove too much of an issue although there are some roads that it would not be advised to use (thanks again to Krishna for the tip off). 

When we arrived back at the hotel our room had been 'turned down' and our slippers left out and a chocolate on the pillow along with a little card to tell us what the weather would be like the next day.  We were also given complimentary vouchers for a free drink each night and I can highly recommend the Sideline cocktail which has apricot jam in it! The bar area is lively and comfortable and was a nice way to spend an evening. 

We would definitely return to this hotel again and are now tempted to try some more of the hotels in the small group. The owners and managers should be very pleased with the way this hotel is run and in particular their staff who really add to the pleasurable experience.",5,2015,11,02
211,Great hotel to end our holiday,After travelling around several countries for several weeks it was a wonderful and relaxing way to end our holiday at the Croke Park Hotel. We got an excellent price for the room and the staff were great on both check-in and check-out. It was thoughtful to get a bottle of water each when we checked out. Our only negative feedback was that there is not enough lights in the main area of the room which makes it difficult to read. Increasing the quality of the juice and views out of the breakfast restaurant would also be a great improvement.,4,2015,11,02
211,Nice hotel,"Stayed at this hotel with friends and from arriving until we left the experience was great.
The staff are very friendly and will help with any queries or bookings. 
The bar is a nice place for a drink and catching up, as they have sofas to relax and even sky sports.
The location is a 25 minute walk into the centre of Dublin, but if the weather is nice, the walk is great. It is away from the main hotels and so you do get the peace and quite that you may wish for.
Taxis are easy to get from the hotel and into the centre they are €8, so not bad and can get there in 5mins.
",5,2015,11,01
211,Croke park hotel,"Excellent hotel. Very child friendly and welcoming. Food was fantastic, great variety for all taste buds. Also late check out was available, which is fantastic for children.  Great value and we will
Be back.",5,2015,11,01
211,Excellent hotel / lovely gesture,"Stayed in this hotel when in Dublin for my sons graduation and it is excellent.The staff are very friendly and helpful .The room was spotless and bed very comfortable.The breakfast was top class and service great,sorry we did not have dinner there as we were out with our son in town..We had mentioned when booking on the website that we were going to a graduation and when we got to our room there was a  two bottles of prosecco for my wife and I.Thanks very much and will definitely visit again.",5,2015,11,01
211,Great hotel,This is a very large modern hotel. Our room was very spacious and comfortable with a huge bathroom with a walk in shower and bath. Everything was very clean and in good condition. There was no noise to disturb us at night. Only down side was that it is a good 10-15 minute walk into town or a €12 taxi ride.,4,2015,10,31
211,Lovely place to stay,"On the plus side - great hotel, and extremely friendly and helpful staff.  Our room was roomy, clean and comfortable and the shower wonderful!  Free parking was welcome.  Breakfast we thought was really good value, and tasty food.  We also ate in the bistro and the food was good, and much the price you would expect in a hotel.
On the downside - there are no directions, to anywhere!  The hotel is located a little further away from the town centre than we thought, but other than that, all absolutely fine.  Would definitely use again.",5,2015,10,31
211,Most comfortable bed on my 10 day trip of Ireland,"Free parking, and nice and clean room.   The bed was amazingly comfortable! Also, the first hotel in Ireland that offered Ice for the rooms and had a mini fridge (maybe these are more American-type amenities?) 
The only downside for me would be the location. There weren't very many shops or restaurant options nearby. There was a stadium across the street, which, if you were headed to a game would be a great location.  ",5,2015,10,31
211,Lovely well run hotel,"Booked in for a couple of nights, highly recommend this hotel. Busy hotel but not faceless. The staff in all areas of the hotel were friendly and highly efficient. Opposite Croke park stadium if you are interested in going for a tour. Not in the centre of Dublin, but in walking distance or you can use public transport or taxi if your not up to it.",5,2015,10,30
211,Superb hotel,"Out second stay at this hotel. Consistently good hotel with friendly staff, clean facilities and comfortable accommodation. Reasonably priced too - very close to city centre and Dublin airport / car-ferry port. Family room included breakfast, parking and hop-on / hop-off city bus tour tickets. ",4,2015,10,30
211,"Lovely stay, great hotel","We stayed at the Croke Hotel mid week from Monday - Wednesday and chose an executive room. We were situated on the 4th floor with complimentary access to the executive lounge that gives you access to continental breakfast from 06:00 -10:30 which was a great way to start the day. You could also access the executive lounge throughout the day/evening for tea/coffee and soft drinks which was great.
The rooms were clean, spacious and well equipped with lovely extras like robes/slippers etc.
The staff were all so friendly and really gave the impression that they wanted to help make your stay memorable.
We ate in the hotel one of the evenings and ordered off of the bar menu that was reasonable and very good food. My only complaint is that the hotel serves peanuts with all alcoholic drinks which made us more cautious as one of us suffers from a nut allergy. With so many severe nut allergy sufferers now it would be good if this was changed. I must point out how good the allergy advice on the menus was though as it really helps overall when ordering food.
We walked into Dublin everyday and it took approx 20 mins with a cab costing about 9 Euros back in the evening.
Altogether a very good stay and I would recommend this hotel if you are happy to be out of the center of Dublin.",5,2015,10,30
211,Cannot wait to come back,"Loved this hotel. Stayed with two small children for mid term break. The welcome was fantastic. Rooms were spacious, clean and quiet. The service was superb. Staff went out of their way to help entertain the children. Food was excellent. Wifi free, free car parking. Excellent location, knowledge of local amenities was  great. The staff couldn't have done any more for us, and made our break very relaxing and as a family we felt welcome and valued. Package rate was good value.",5,2015,10,29
211,Everything I want in a hotel,"I recently had a wonderful stay at this hotel.  The staff were all pleasant and efficient.  My regular room was spacious, modern, and comfortable.  The bathroom had a large modern shower and a separate full size tub - not found in most newer hotels.
I ate in the restaurant and was pleasantly surprised.  At first I thought the menu was somewhat pricey and needed more choices.  However, my wife and I both had no trouble finding things to order and most importantly we both thought our meals were fantastic and well worth the money.  The free breakfasts were better than the usual offerings.
As has been noted by many the hotel is outside of the city centre but we enjoyed that.  It is a full 25 minute walk to the downtown but we took a different route each time and felt it gave us a better sense of the city.  Also makes it very easy to get a taxi to the airport. There were no events on at the stadium so the rate was very reasonable for such an impressive hotel.",5,2015,10,28
211,TOP CLASS HOTEL,Stayed here in August while my partner was in hospital nearby. The hotel is immaculate. The staff are extremely friendly and helpful . The reception team are wonderful. My room was very spacious with a king size bed. During my stay I ate in the bar and the food was delicious . I would highly reccommend this hotel. I will definitely be back. ,5,2015,10,28
211,Nearly perfect! A few snagging issues before the perfect stay.,"Stayed here for three nights on the top floor. Really impressed to have access to Executive Lounge which includes a relaxed surrounding with newspapers, hot and cold beverages, light snacks etc. Although, quite rightly, this is also a family hotel, I don't think children should have access to the Executive Lounge. On one visit there were children running around. The relaxed and professional atmosphere took a bit of a hit! '
The location is not the best but a ten minute stroll gets you to the main shopping areas of Dublin. The concierge sells hop on and off bus tickets. We chose the 48 hour ticket which stops right outside the front of the hotel. This then takes you to Parnell Square where you can change to the next bus (here the tours begin!)
The customer service on this hotel is 5 star and nothing is too much trouble. I like the one free drink per guest, per night feature. The Sideline Bar is very good and the perfect place to unwind at night, before retiring to your room. Breakfast is served in the restaurant behind and is of very good quality. Once again, service swift and very polite staff.
The only issues I would like to raise are the fact that there is quite a bit of noise from banging doors, especially from 6am. This appears to be the cleaners who on each morning of our stay, bustled about slamming doors, banging trays etc. This continues from 6am - around 8am when guests leave their rooms for breakfast/checkout etc. Also, a vending machine for bits such as Paracetamol wouldn't go a miss. I had to walk ten minutes through a bit of a dodgy neighbourhood to buy some from a SPAR after being brushed off by Reception when requesting this.
All in all, a really nice stay but a few issues to be resolved before we stay again.",5,2015,10,28
211,Very warm & compassionate staff.,"My family stayed at this hotel in Dublin as we were accompanying a critically ill family member in a nearby hospital. We did not know the length of our stay at the hotel. The staff were fantastic allowing us late checkout, late cancellation and being sensitive to our situation. They could not have done more for us. The hotel facilities and rooms were of a high standard. The food / breakfasts were also very good. We hope to return to stay at this wonderful hotel in the future as a weekend break! ",5,2015,10,27
211,Another pleasant stay at the Croke Park Hotel,"I recently stayed at the Croke Park Hotel with family and found it to be as usual very pleasant and comfortable. We were travelling with children to the One Direction Concert so safety within the hotel was a necessity and the Croke Park did not fail us.   The staff were pleasant on arrival, in the Restaurant and at breakfast the following morning.  Definately would recommend this hotel to families for comfort and value for money and a very pleasant experience.  ",5,2015,10,26
211,"very impressed , will definitely use this hotel again .","Very welcoming ,staff could not do enough to make our stay pleasant .clean ,bright .stayed in family room ,.filled our requirements. Huge fluffy towels ,very relaxing .Breakfast was super.free cocktail  finished our evening off nicely .great for parking .will definitely go back .family or friends I feel this hotel would fit the bill .",5,2015,10,26
211,Great stay at Croke Park,"There were 7 of us in the group with 4 rooms - on executive floor. Rooms were spacious and clean and having the slippers/gowns and executive lounge was definitely worth it - continental breakfast was good too. Location was ideal for us and staff were very welcoming on the whole - did have some communication difficulties with bar staff on ordering fiod, but food quality was excellent.",5,2015,10,26
211,"Great breakfast, nice place but a little far from everything ","Very nice hotel and the staff was great. The Irish breakfast is amazing with everything you could probably want. Wifi was free, clean rooms, seems like a safe area though walking the 5-7 minutes to and from the Main Street to catch a bus did make me nervous at first. You do have a few eateries and stores around but mainly you take the bus down to Parnell Square for more options.",4,2015,10,25
211,"Gorgeous Hotel, Amazing Stay","I stayed here with a friend last weekend. On arrival we had a really quick check-in which was nice. Decor is fabulous in the hotel, and the facilities in the room is just more than you need. A big TV, a stereo, a notepad and all the toiletries were a great little bonus. It is the nicest hotel I have stayed in yet. The room was spotless,and the beds were very comfortable. The shower was big and the water pressure was good, and the bath was a good size also! We had food there also and the food was good and we were served quickly. The staff were also very nice. There is a mini bar in the room and also a trouser press as well as an iron board. I was very impressed with hotel, and I will 100% be returning!",5,2015,10,25
211,A return to Croke Park,"Having stayed at this property on a previous occasion, I decided to give it another try.  It's away from the bustle of the touristy part of the city, but not so far as to be inconvenient.  My first experience was excellent and found the return no less so.  Some of the staff remembered me from the previous visit, making the latest stay even more pleasant.

The rooms and facilities were clean and well maintained.  I would caution visitors that it can be a challenge to get the attention of a server in the Bistro and Bar when they are busy.

Overall, an excellent choice for someone looking to visit Dublin.",5,2015,10,25
211,Beautiful hotel,"We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at The Croke Park hotel this weekend. The rooms are beautiful and the housekeeping staff are very nice! Shame about the bar, fantastic food but very slow service and the staff weren't fully knowledgable about items on their menu. ",4,2015,10,25
211,"Great Hotel, convenient and friendly","Have often stayed here: it's modern, comfy rooms, free parking, great staff who always make the effort to help you out (umbrellas on rainy days, cool towels on hot days),
Small gym, relaxed bar with local staff, nice lounge on fourth floor (if you can get a room there).
Right beside Croke Park, so perfect for gigs and matches, surprisingly near city centre.",5,2015,10,25
211,Lovely few nights ,"We had an amazing stay at The Croke Park Hotel, the staff went out of their way to help celebrate my boyfriends birthday with prosecco in the room on arrival. We were even upgraded and thought the rooms were fantastic. We ate at the hotel for breakfast and for dinner for two days, breakfast was great and I thought reasonably priced as it was a buffet style and lots to choose from. Dinner was lovely too, slightly more than I would choose to pay but the quality of food made up for that easily, having said that it was probably priced in line with other city hotels. Will definitely be visiting again!",5,2015,10,25
211,"Comfortable, friendly and delicious food. Good location. My new favourite in Dublin.","I stayed here on business recently. It's immediately opposite Croke Park so great for sporting or Conferences. But although completely modern I loved this hotel. Elegant, clean, stylish and with character.  Comfortable rooms and very, very friendly staff.

Dinner during the evening was delicious. Steak cooked rare to my liking and a delicious crème brulee. Their home made guiness soda bread was stunning and the cheese and ham toasted sandwich with this bread I had for lunch the next day was excellent.  Excellent breakfast choice including proper Irish white and black puddings and good bacon.  Great continental buffet too. Good size portions and well done food. 

It's close enough to city centre to take a bus (bus stop five mins walk away) or a taxi, or a 20 minute walk to O' Connell Street (College Green about 35 mins) (1.7km) and it's only about 20 mins from the airport in normal traffic. Given Dublin's highly unpredictable and heavy traffic this is a good choice for the airport. 

Will definitely be back.",4,2015,10,23
211,Great place to end our Irish vacation!,"Little did I realize when I made our reservation with Sarah that I would enjoy our stay at the Croak as much as we did. It was a little like home without being home; people were so friendly.
The level of service from the front desk, bar, bistro and business centre facilities were impressive as it was with Sarah.
Our room was a comfortable size with a comfortable bed.
The breakfast was very good; something I have never seen on a buffet before was tasty,stewed rhubarb.
Table service at breakfast and dinner was very good - prompt and friendly.
There was a problem with WiFi when we arrived but it improved a bit when we were there.
Take note that the hop on hop off is not available on the weekend.
With the front desk prearranging a taxi, it only took minutes to get to the Dublin airport.",5,2015,10,22
211,"Clean,well-run, lobby and common areas more impressive than the rooms","Well-run hotel is about a 20-minute walk from the city center through an interesting area. Best hotel breakfast I have ever had, superb table service. If you request a quiet room you get an inner courtyard room. Quiet at night except if anyone is sitting on the couple of benches and talking, in which case it is very annoying. Front desk staff very available and helpful. Bed good,not great. Room is average.",4,2015,10,22
211,Dublin mini break,"Hotel room was really comfortable, excellent service from the staff, very willing to help.
My only critism would be it is out the way from the main city centre, the hop on hop off bus picks up from the hotel which was brilliant & excellent value.
      ",4,2015,10,22
211,Mediocre at best,"This is (maybe now ""was"") going to be a hotel I would use on a regular basis. However my recent stay was mediocre at best.

Check-in was prompt and efficient, no issues there. Room was adequate but not wow or anything special to comment on.  My main issue was around the service in the main/public areas and noise in the early morning, which I can only assume was made by housekeeping getting themselves set up.

The service issues started on day one in the bar when I ordered some food. It took a good 30 mins to arrive. No apologies before or when it was delivered and when it was the food was underwhelming, mainly because of the half cooked chips and dry bun.  Breakfast the following day wasn't better, it was clear then (and again the following day) the wait staff didn't want to be there. Nonchalantly walking around clearing tables and no effort to deliver tea/coffee, toast in a quick/efficient manner or even smile when doing so.  Dinner on the second eve (again in the bar) was again slow service. This time because it took 20 mins to be acknowledged and for my order to be taken. That said, this time the food and drink came in minutes!

On to the noise in the morning, it appeared to be coming from the banging of trolleys, setting up of trolleys in the corridor, which I can only assume was housekeeping. Interestingly the table next to me on my first morning at breakfast were also complaining about the early morning noise and how loud and disturbing it was.

As school reports say, could do better. And that sums up my recent stay at this hotel in a nutshell. Will I be back, I'm not sure, I may give the other hotel a whirl.",3,2015,10,21
211,review from a customer service trainer,"As a customer service trainer and someone who stays in a lot of hotels, it is rare to find a venue that that doesn't let things slip in one area or another. I have to say I was very impressed with the level of service I received from every member of staff, from reception to the restaurant, the bar and the business centre facilities, you exceeded my expectations. Some outside heater to keep us smokers warm would be my nice but regardless I will definitely be returning soon and wouldn't consider staying anywhere else. ",5,2015,10,21
211,Great one night stay!,Lovely hotel.  Booked it through one of the many re-seller websites as it was half the rate of the direct booking price.  Hot towels provided on arrival.  Reception staff pleasant and efficient.  Room lovely.  Two double beds.  Shower and bath - I have to have at least one bath any time I stay in a hotel!  Had bar food in the lounge and watched the rugby.  Chowder was lovely. The bar is slightly clinical looking - polished marble etc. rather than a traditional pub.  Nice ambience.  Lots of people around but nice and quiet and civilized.  Left next morning without any issues.  Parking conveniently below the hotel.  No games on at Croke Park but this would be perfect for seeing a game or doing a tour.  For international travellers this is convenient to the airport (on the north side) but I'd probably recommend a taxi to the city centre at night.  Taxi cost us 11 Euro in and 12 Euro out so very convenient.  Delighted that the Croke Park Hotel is in keeping with the international reputation of the stadium.  Happy to provide 5 star rating.,5,2015,10,20
211,"Great value, excellent food and customer service","Stayed at the hotel for 3 nights w/c 12th October as part of a city break, upgraded to a deluxe package which gives you access to the executive lounge (which is very nice) and a free complimentary drink per person each night. We hardly paid any extra so we felt this was really good value. Our room was ready much earlier than we thought it would be and it was a nice, clean spacious room. The customer service during our stay was excellent, everyone appears to be genuinely happy in their job (which is sometimes rare these days). Breakfast was great too, plenty of food/drinks to choose from and I would recommend booking this when booking your accommodation as it is better value. The hotel is immaculate throughout and modern and the bar area is great, it has a big roaring fire which is just what you need after a day in the city! We ate in the bar area on the first night and the food was really good, proper homemade chips! Although the hotel is slightly out of the centre (about 20 mins walk), it didn't detract from anything for us, there are regular shuttle buses running in the morning which take you to the nearest 'hop on, hop off' bus stops which are a great way to see the city and visit landmarks and the hotel concierge gave us some great tourist tips which saved us some money. Overall, a great hotel and we will stay here again. Top marks!",5,2015,10,20
211,Night in Dublin,We stayed at croke park hotel. Really enjoyed the staff food and the comfort of the hotel. Bar food very tasty and easy access to City when reception booked taxis. Child friendly also which is a bonus to any parent,5,2015,10,19
211,All the Ammenities,"This is an excellent hotel, well furnished, clean and well staffed with well trained personal
Quality of food is very good. Well dressed cooking, and food preparation  staff being open to dining room is a plus. Great location if attending game in Coke Park stadium, otherwise not that great.",4,2015,10,19
211,"Great hotel, a bit out of the way","Stayed here as everything was sold out near the center.  Great hotel, absolutely perfect once inside.  Only downside is that its away from the center, and right next to the monstrous stadium and in a rather unsightly residential area.  ",4,2015,10,19
211,Lovely Hotel,"Stayed here with colleagues on business.
The welcome was good.  The rooms extremely spacious with excellent amenities.  No one would have a good view dye to its location next to the stadium, canal and railway line!!!! BUT the line was quiet at night so no issues. 

Restaurant food is of a very good standard as is the breakfast.  Only niggle is that there didn't seem to be enough staff and on all 3 days had to seek out a waiter for tea, coffee and toast.

Only 10 minute walk into the city and a taxi ride from the airport so location is good. 
Staff lovely. A very good hotel.",4,2015,10,19
211,Very nearly 5 stars,"Stayed for 2 nights for my birthday and were looked after very well. Reception staff were excellent and the hotel was clean and well presented. Location was good - only a 15 minute walk to the City. The birthday card and complimentary birthday drinks were a nice touch. The only reason for a 4 star, rather than a 5 star review.....a king size bed! A hotel like this should have larger beds as standard. Great weekend though - thank you. ",4,2015,10,18
211,Base for a Dublin break,"We stayed in a nice Deluxe Room for a night as we explored Dublin for a couple of days. The hotel itself isn't in the best neighbourhood, except for being right next to Croke Park. However, the hotel is perfectly located for a relatively short walk into the city. As one would expect from this type of hotel, the rooms are not huge and relatively generic, but ours was clean and just what we needed as 'stopover'. We didn't eat in the hotel in the evening, but the breakfast was OK and plentiful.",4,2015,10,18
211,Great hotel,"spent 3 nights at the Croke park hotel 11th oct  check in easy and very friendly rooms are lovely with good big bathrooms  26 "" tv coffe tea etc . Bar is v good with loads of tv options for sport  and not to badly priced for dublin  5 euro 40 for a Guinness  to give u a idea . Breakfast is fantastic  full irish help yourself  also hams cheeses cearel  jams honey etc also they will make u a omelet if u fancy it can well recommend . Only downside is it is a longish walk to temple bar area although I think hop on bus stops near if u doing that tour also always taxis at door ",5,2015,10,17
211,Great Hotel,"This was the first hotel on our tour.  We requested an early check-in and they were very accommodating.  Our room was comfortable, the service was great, the breakfast buffet was wonderful.  We would stay here again",4,2015,10,16
211,"Friendly, professional, clean & comfortable!","I was traveling for business, but had my 8-year-old niece and my boyfriend with me. So it was a combined business/family trip. I booked Croke park through an travel agent (Amoma), and got a really good price for 3 persons room (123€), including breakfast. They gave us a family room so had plenty of space. Beds were super comfortable, room was clean and quiet. We ate et the bar twice, and when I mentioned we were in a hurry the food arrived really quickly. All the staff were extremely friendly and seemed to be able to do it without forcing it. Would highly recommend!",5,2015,10,15
211,Excellent Stay,"Stayed here with a group of friends for someone's 50th, room was very nice. Hotel staff were very friendly and happy to arrange taxi's. Breakfast was excellent along with the night time bar. Fairly good location for getting into centre of town. Good price for the standard. Would definitely stay again.",5,2015,10,15
211,"Hotel ok,location not ok","Hotel was fine: clean , friendly , helpful staff, food ok , but the location was not good. Not minding a walk, but having to go past questionable neighborhoods, trashy streets with dog mess, broken bottles was not what we had in mind to get to the shopping of Dublin. We did not venture out after dark for same reason",3,2015,10,15
211,Croke park hotel,"The hotel itself is immaculate - I have to admit when I saw where it was I was less than impressed. A lot of graffiti and dog mess on nearby pavements. I accept it's not the hotels fault but surely the local council should do something as tourists get a bad impression of the area. Once we got our bearings it only took us 15 to 20 minutes to walk into the centre and we caught a bus a couple of times. Our room was spacious and had everything anyone could want. The bathroom was very big and had a separate bath and shower which were spotless. The mattress on the bed has to be one of the best we've slept on and the pillows were fantastic. The ice maker on the floor was a nice extra. I wish we'd  asked for bathrobes as it would have made it lovely. The staff were helpful and friendly. We did use the bar for drinks but we didn't eat there at all as we had so many places in the centre to choose from. One thing I found to be irritating was the piles of laundry, trolleys and food trays on the floor in the corridors. You understand they have a job to do but it was constantly a mess. I imagine that if you have booked tickets for an event in the stadium that it's a perfect venue. Personally I would rather stay in  a smaller room in a hotel nearer the centre. That said the hotel itself is Immaculate. ",4,2015,10,13
211,Nice place and pleasant staff,I stayed here overnight while attending a conference in the Conference centre in the stadium opposite the hotel. The room was very comfortable and had aIrcon and all mod cons. I asked for a 7.00 am early morning call and it arrived spot on the button as did the morning paper I requested. On a previous stay I had to complain that they forgot my early morning call and I was forced to rush to my appointment without breakfast. The management apologised profusely on that occasion and were decent enough to acknowledge the blunder and made it up to me in another way. They did not forget the early call this time so all is forgiven. The breakfast choice is splendid and you can avail of a much wider choice than some hotels offer. I particularly liked the option of getting honey fresh from the honey comb. I actually saw a guy taking a photograph of the large section on display. On checking out I was offered a complimentary bottle of water and was sent on my way with a nice smile from the reception staff. The conference centre in the stadium opposite was equally impressive and the stadium itself with an eighty five thousand seating capacity is world class. Would recommend the rooftop tour and would certainly recommend for one of the sporting event or concerts which take place there. Taxis outside the hotel will take you to city centre for about 8 Euro. All in all I like this hotel and will definitely be back.,4,2015,10,13
211,Definitely Will Be Returning!! ,"So where do i start, first of all i would like to say that I have never had such a friendly and warm welcome in any hotel i have stayed in, not only was I professionally informed but also had a laugh at the same time. Janel & Ian are an asset to your hotel, they truly put a smile on my partner and I's face with their double act humour! 

Moving on to room's, we was complimentary upgraded to 4th floor, the room was lovely and spacious with a big kind bed, we also had access to the executive lounge which was great!!

Service in the restaurant and bar was always consistent and great! 

The only slight issue i had was that the stay was so short!

Croke Park Hotel Management you have a wonderful team and i would definitely return back if not for anything else for them.

Thank you for a wonderful couple of days!

211,22 hrs in dublin,We stayed just one night and we were both sick to top it off.  Instead of hitting the town we ate at the Sideline Bistro in the hotel and were completely satisfied with their offerings.  Very comfortable in the room and all in all you can not go wrong staying here.  ,4,2015,10,12
211,Consistently one of the best,"Great staff, very nice rooms & amenities, good bar scene for adults & business types.  Directly across from Croke Park Stadium.  Excellent location for access to airport (15 minute cab ride) and downtown Dublin/Trinity College (15 minutes cab ride).   You can also walk 2-3 blocks and catch the bus.",5,2015,10,12
211,"Friendly Staff, spotless room & lovely facilities",The staff were extremely friendly on arrival and had no problem checking us in a little early.  They offered complimentary warm towels to freshen up which was a nice touch.  Our room was lovely and spacious with two double beds.  The bathroom had both a separate shower and bath.  The room & bathroom itself were spotless.  We ordered room service for breakfast and they forgot part of our order but were very prompt in bringing it up to us after I rang.  As a guest also they offer free parking which is great as the cost of parking is so expensive in Dublin.  ,5,2015,10,12
211,Successful flying visit,"Excellent modern hotel within walking distance of city centre.Quiet spacious room overlooking canal.Good breakfast.Liked the Sideline Bar complete with giant TV screen showing 24 hour rolling news.Highly recommended.

211,Great ending to a wonderful vacaction,"This is a very comfortable modern hotel near the airport at Croke Park Stadium.  It was our final destination before flying out after a nine day tour. The rooms were great, comfortable bed, mini bar was convenient, although the hotel bar was a fun and busy place. Ice machine on each floor was unusual for Ireland.",5,2015,10,10
211,Too Far,NIce hotel but nothing special.  By stadium but far from everything else.  The area around the hotel is not one I would want to walk around in after dark.  Without a car you are stuck using a taxi to get into Dublin.  Only place to eat is the hotel restaurant and it is pricey.  They do have a shuttle service to take you closer to public transportation but we were told there was only 3 runs in the morning and the last one was at 10:30 am.  This hotel is really set up for the people who only want to go to an event at the stadium and nothing else.  We had an early morning flight and the front desk staff at 6 AM was very nice and very helpful.,3,2015,10,08
211,Great hotel,"I have stayed here many times, for both business and leisure purposes and I love it. It is always a pleasure to stay here. Staff are welcoming, check in is efficient. Rooms are very comfortable. The hotel has a great atmosphere on match day! I have had access to the lounge on the 4th floor on a few visits, well worth it - very comfortable space with tea/coffee facilities and fruit/pastries. There is complementary parking and its a short walk into O'Connell St. 

Great location, great service!

Love staying here, can't wait for the next the trip. ",5,2015,10,08
211,Recent croke park hotel stay,"After a long days travel and work a guilty pleasure is to stay in the croke park hotel in Dublin. A warm friendly greeting and a welcoming environment is what I always meet upon arrival .a quick and efficient check in and a spotless and warm bedroom is always available . Good food , great service and facilities to meet my needs ensure i'm fully refreshed upon leaving the next morning . Keep up the great work  ",5,2015,10,08
211,Skip this hotel unless here for the stadium!,"I cannot understand why this hotel gets positive reviews.  The hotel is comfortable but in a terrible area.  Right outside the hotel on the way to the Italian restaurant recommended by the hotel, there has been human feces on the sidewalk for four days!  They don't have any vending machines so when I come back after a long day and just want a coke, I had to pay 3 euros for about 6 ounces.  Also, the room is dated.  You can tell by the CD player in every room.  Thanks, I did not bring my CD collection from the 90s.  Maybe use some of that overpriced beverage bounty on cleaning feces or updating the rooms!  If you want to walk and explore the city, you really need to catch a taxi to a nice area before you do.  Otherwise you are likely to get mugged or at best a shoe full of feces.",1,2015,10,07
211,Comfortable and good location,"We stayed here for one night over the weekend for our anniversary and the room was very comfortable and quiet. We had an excellent, filling buffet breakfast the next morning and they kept our luggage for free after checkout so we could explore the city on our second day without worrying about lugging it around town.",5,2015,10,05
211,St Patrick's Day ,"Came here with my best friend for St Patrick's day. Was a beautiful hotel and a beautiful room, great location got the airport bus and had a five minute walk to there took about 10/15 minutes to get Ito the town. Was a great atmosphere because there was a game on. Lovely people who helped us with our luggage as we were to early for check in. ",4,2015,10,04
211,birthday getaway,This was my first trip to Ireland and it was a great trip. The concierge and front desk were very friendly and helpful. We had a wonderful stay. The restaurant and breakfast was very good....the Irish roast beef was amazing. The rooms were very comfortable.,5,2015,10,04
211,Very friendly people,"Spent three nights here in September. The price seemed right considering how expensive hotels in Dublin seem to be. The room was much bigger than I had expected as was the bathroom. It's not too far from the airport, but a little far from the town centre. We took taxi's in the evening to get back from town. Still a very good place. ",4,2015,10,03
211,All Ireland weekend,"Book early folks!!!

I booked the Sunday and Monday nights in the hotel in March and was put on the reserve list for Saturday night hoping that there would be a cancellation, but there wasn't.

As you can imagine the hotel is buzzing/hectic for this time of year as 83000 people attend the matches in the Croke Park stadium just across the road.

The staff cope very well with the volume of people.

We had breakfast and dinner in the hotel and it was all good.

The hotel is wheelchair accessible and the room was suitable for me",4,2015,10,01
211,felt I was taken advantage of,"I booked 3 nights at the Croke Park hotel in Dublin from the US.  I was traveling in Ireland and Dublin was our last stop before taking off for home in Seattle.  I picked this hotel because it was in the north and closer to the airport for our very early flight home to Seattle.  My first 2 night were at a reasonable rate, but the third night was increased 50% because of a sporting event at the nearby stadium.  I felt I was being taken advantage of because of the sporting event.  I stayed 2 nights and why was the 3rd night so expensive.  I asked the hotel to look into it and maybe give me an adjustment.  I got the excuse that since I booked through a on-line broker (Trip Adviser) their hands were tied. I have heard this before and it is so disappointing to be penalized for using Trip Adviser.

Anyway I had to check out of the hotel at 2am to make a 6 am flight, and pay 50% more for a salt in the wound just because there was a sporting event going on near by.  And I had already spent two nights there.  Traveler gets burned. 

By the way, the hotel was packed and parties going on in the lobby until 2am in the morning.  I don't think they were hurting for revenue.",2,2015,10,01
211,Excellent hotel,"This is a very nice hotel directly across from Croke Park stadium. Keep that in mind when you plan your stay. It would be extremely convenient for attending a game, but very noisy if not. The beds are extremely comfortable and the amenities (towels, linens, shampoo, etc.) were very nice. It is a short taxi ride to and from the airport. We stayed here on our last day in Dublin so being closer to the airport was key. It is not close to downtown Dublin activities.",5,2015,09,30
211,Handy for Airport and Dublin Port,"Well run hotel North of the river - necessitates taxi journeys of up to ten euros a time to get to the centre of Dublin - but handy for a stopover if travelling the next day.  Staff were efficient, bathroom was well equipped and loved the water/ice machine in the corridor outside our room!",4,2015,09,30
211,A very nice hotel in Dublin.,"I stayed at the Croke Park recently with family and had a very nice stay.  I called at the last moment to reserve a room and the receptionist (Michelle) was very helpful and accommodating.  The bed and breakfast package is a great value and we enjoyed the breakfast both mornings of our stay.  The room we were in was very spacious, clean and had all of the amenities needed.  If you're looking for a very affordable, clean, and quiet hotel in Dublin, I'd highly recommend the Croke Park!",5,2015,09,30
211,Best Hotel in Dublin,"Superb, quiet, clean and very comfortable. Staff are friendly and all the meals and service were excellent. Right across from the Croke Stadium which can make the place extremely busy on game days. I would highly recommend this hotel.",5,2015,09,29
211,Good Value for Money,"We took our car over to Ireland to visit relatives and this hotel had free parking which was a bonus.  Efficient check in staff, good sized room.  Had to get a taxi for each of three trips into Dublin Centre - averaged about 10 euros each single trip - but it was very close to Dublin Port for our return ferry trip which was important to us.  Would we stay there again - possibly!",4,2015,09,29
211,Hotel with great location and accomadating staff,"We had some issues at check in, and had to request help from the manager.  Our issues were taken care of to our satisfaction.  The staff checked in with us for the remainder of our 3 day stay to make sure everything was ok.  I would recommend this hotel.",4,2015,09,28
211,Just an excellent Place!,"It was great, quiet, clean and very comfortable. Staffs were extremely friendly and all the meals and service were excellent.  Right across from the Croke Stadium which can make the place extremely busy on game days. I would highly recommend this hotel, however the drawback is you are a bit of distance from downtown (about a €8 taxi ride or 20 minute walk). Other than game day this is an excellent spot to fight jet lag and acclimatize to the weather in times zone. Their hospitality was very welcoming and I especially enjoyed the service and food in the restaurant and lounge.",5,2015,09,28
211,Excellent stay,"Stayed overnight on Saturday ,staff were very polite and helpful.Room was spotless and after booking in and using room I Had to go out for a few hours from 5 pm onwards.When I returned my room had been tended too with treats ,and freshly tidied up.
On Sunday the front office manager was excellent and she gave me great assistance when making arrangements for members of my family who were dining in the hotel.
I will be using this hotel again and would strongly recommend it.",5,2015,09,28
211,Very pleased,"Lovely hotel, clean, all modern decor, great service my only disappointment was how far it is from the city centre. A bit costly by taxi if you keep going in and out of city. 
Breakfast was good, especially the honeycomb! The complimentary drinks were fabulous! And thank you so much for the prosecco to celebrate our wedding anniversary. ",4,2015,09,28
211,Lovely hotel for a great stay in dublin,"Stayed here with my boyfriend for 2 nights in August. The croke Park was in walking distance from the city centre and in easy reach of bus routes. Hotel had a luxury feel. Although we spent most of our time exploring Dublin, it was a great base to get some rest. Would stay here again when returning to Dublin - which we most certainly will, such a brilliant city! Try the zoo and nightlife is great. ",4,2015,09,27
211,Visiting the boyfriends mother! ,"We stayed here last February for 4 nights when visiting the boyfriends mother and I absolutely loved this hotel. I couldn't fault it in the slightest. Check was lovely and upon arrival we were given complimentary bottle of water and warm hot towels to warm our hands on as it was very cold. The rooms were spacious and lovely and had a great nights sleep. We had a hire car while we were there as his mother lived on the other side of Dublin and we wanted to explore the city and surrounding areas and the fact the the hotel had free secure parking was an added bonus for us. We came to check out we were given more complimentary free bottled water for our journey and I could keep a room key as a souvenir as I like to keep little bits. However we didn't try any of the food as we had breakfast at his mums every morning and liked to go out at nights to different restaurants. 

Would 100% stay here again if we ever went back to Dublin. One of the best hotels I've ever stayed in. ",5,2015,09,25
211,Nice hotel and nice amenities,The Croke Park hotel was top notch.  Very well appointed rooms and great friendly service.  The room included a buffet breakfast and the food was a cut above the normal offerings.  The hotel also offered free parking which was a plus in the city.,5,2015,09,24
211,Beautiful and convenient to airport,"We stayed here at the end of our trip to be closer to the airport for an early morning flight. Beautiful modern hotel with top notch service. We had bottled water - sparkling and still - plus fresh fruit waiting when we arrived and turn down service with chocolates on the pillow.  Restaurant offered nice options too, not just bar food. Be aware it is a little further out from the city center so you'll walk a good half hour in but cabs were plentiful so we just did that, although Croke was nice enough we could have just stayed in. A great, relaxing end to our trip. ",5,2015,09,24
211,Our 2nd visit- excellent again!,"My wife and I- along with our adult son-stayed here on our last night in Ireland during our September visit.  
This hotel is just great. Our check-in went very well although we had one small issue in that the keys for our room didn’t work and I had to go back to have them re-keyed. Our son had no problem getting into his room. This was only a minor inconvenience. 
The rooms were well appointed and spotlessly clean. It was very quiet that night and we slept well. What else can you ask for!
We just had time for their breakfast the next morning and it was excellent. There were lots of breakfast meats, fruit, cereal, etc. While it was essentially a self-service buffet, our server brought us coffee or tea and also toast. 
Oh, the complimentary parking there is also excellent- down just one floor, very clean parking area and you felt safe. It was very easy to get back into the main part of the hotel. 
We booked the two rooms through TripAdvisor and got what I believe is an excellent rate. It’s a good thing we booked them many months ago because of the big soccer match that Sunday between Kerry and Dublin. There was also a match or several matches at Croke Park Stadium on that Saturday. We used the opportunity to tour the Croke Park Stadium- just across the street- late that Friday afternoon.  We took a taxi to a few pubs and then back to our hotel that night- no problems. 
This was our 2nd visit to the Croke Park Hotel. I highly recommend it and hope you found this review helpful. .",5,2015,09,24
211,"Beautiful, modern Hotel","Our family stayed here for a few nights in two rooms during a tour of Ireland.  This was booked through a Groupon deal, and we were very pleased with this hotel.  The accommodations are top notch, it is very clean and modern, and with a really nice restaurant and great bar as well.  Our rooms were spacious, clean and modern.  The service overall from check-in to check-out was excellent.   The location is great, and within walking distance to many attractions.  We'll stay here again next time in Dublin.",5,2015,09,23
211,Top Notch,Excellent hotel. Service was outstanding. Good bar with food available until 9 or 9:30pm. Right across the street from the stadium. Only slight drawback is that it is a decent walk to any restaurant or pub. Overall very much worth the time.,5,2015,09,21
211,"Great hotel, great staff","This hotel is second to none, great location coming into
Dublin from airport direction, walking distant to O’Connell Street,
Friendly and helpful staff from Alan to Khrisna, and everyone in
Between.
""We'll be back""",5,2015,09,21
211,Lovely birthday.,"Very clean and very friendly, also very helpful. Perfect place for a 5min stroll into the heart of Dublin. Opposite Croke park stadium, really a great place. Could not fault the food, very pleasant surroundings.",5,2015,09,20
211,Should be everyone's first choice in Dublin,"We had two stays at Croke Park this month.  Our  first time we arrived early and we were served coffee  tea  and cookies while we waited a short while for our room to be ready. The hotel sends a pre-stay questionnaire and before our second stay,  I mentioned that we were celebrating our anniversary.  When we checked in, there were two bottles of bubbly chilling for us, and a friendly card.  We used both the dining room and the lounge and both are fabulous. Our rooms were very comfortable and both had separate tubs/showers. The cab fare between the hotel and the airport was only €18. You wouldn't want to walk between City Centre and The Croke Park after dark, but as they're located so close, the cab fares were very reasonable.",5,2015,09,20
211,Regular visitor,This is a great hotel. I always try and book in here when I'm in Dublin. Parking is free and it's just a great hotel. Some say the area is dodgy but to be fair it's an inner city hotel. I wouldn't walk around a lot of places at night so this is never an issue for me.,5,2015,09,20
211,very disappointing stay,"of all the hotels we stay in this experience was by far the most disappointing.
Alot was said during my booking contact with reception, of the croke park breakfast but believe me the hotel gets the very basics wrong!!!!!!
There is little point telling guests to avail of breakfast upto a certain time when clearing breakfast begins twenty minutes before breakfast officially is over, resulting in clattering and banging  of cultery and delf. never mind the  need to ask for breakfast basics like mik and toast",3,2015,09,20
211,Excellent service!,"We arrived at the hotel at 9 am exhausted from our overnight flight, and they were able to check us in early.  The breakfast that was included was delicious.  Everyone at the hotel was polite, professional and courteous.  Croke Park is a very well run hotel with excellent customer service! ",5,2015,09,20
211,Free Upgrade,"We stayed only one night, as we were passing in transit. We had no problem checking in at 11.30pm. We originally booked a standard twin room without breakfast, but were upgraded to the executive floor with access to the executive lounge, where free continental breakfast was served. Beds were spacious and mattresses were comfortable. The room had all kinds of useful extras such as tea and coffee facilities, however the AC in the bathroom was a bit noisy and there was no toilet brush.",4,2015,09,20
211,Spacious room,"Although the hotel is not downtown, it is only a 15 minute walk. The hotel is clean and comfortable. The bathroom was large with a separate tub and shower. The room space was good for two people. We had a room with two double beds. I would stay here again.",4,2015,09,19
211,Fantastic hotel,"Our first visit to Dublin. Great location. We were greeted by very friendly and helpful staff.We could walk 20 min. to most attractions. At night we took a cab. The king bed and linens were luxurious. 
Highly recommend The Croke Park Hotel.",5,2015,09,19
211,Excellent hotel,"Checked in here after my stay in Dublin got extended & there were limited choices in Dublin that had rooms. Nice hotel, receptionist upgraded me to Executive which was rather nice Great room, nicely laid out. Great if as I was you're working in there for quite a while. Staff very nice. 
Only downer was dinner, fairly noisy bar, waiter not having great english. I asked what Ciders they had & that seemed to throw him! Limited choice either Bulmers or another, had better choices elsewhere in Dublin. I ordered strip steak, he asked if I wanted medium. & I said no med rare.Well when it arrived it was definitely medium, to well done. It was OK. Unfortunately there is a huge TV screen in this bar & then the football started! The volume went up & the staff just vapourised! Once I attracted someones attention, then ordered ice cream & it just got forgotten. After a while I decided I was getting deafened by the football & asked someone to cancel the ice cream & bring a bill. He then bought the ice cream, admittedly saying no charge! At that point I said I just wanted the bill eventually got it & signed & left.",4,2015,09,18
211,Not far from city centre,"I really enjoyed my visit to Dublin. The weather was lovely when I walked into the city centre. The hotel was average, I didn't have any issues. I didn't focus too much on the hotel especially as there aren't too many problems, I found it convenient to get from A to Z.",3,2015,09,18
211,Superb stay perfect,"Great stay at this hotel. We were on the executive floor so a bit more expensive but well worth it. 10-15 brisk walk to the centre of Dublin and less than 10 euro plus tip by taxi. 
Facilities in the hotel top notch! room usual and functional. Would stay here again",5,2015,09,18
211,Excellent,"We travelled around in Ireland for 3 weeks.  Stayed in many hotels.  Croke Park Hotel was one of the top 3 hotels.  The room was clean, bed was very comfortable, staff was very friendly, the gym was the best we have ever seen in any hotel, breakfast exceeded our expectations, great value for the price, and the 20 minute walk to city center helped to burn off calories from excessive eating on vacation.  We recommend this hotel highly. ",5,2015,09,18
211,Flight attendant ,"This is one of the best hotels that I've ever stayed in. I have a severe allergy to fragrances which is really a chemical sensitivity. They gave me a ""fragranced-free"" room. It made ny stay. The rooms are extremely clean. A lot of hotels use deodorizing sprays to cover up instead of actually cleaning. This is one hotel where the rooms are actually clean. The staff was amazing and went beyond the call of duty by calling the airport for me to help me to locate my cell phone. Like I said this is one of the best hotels that I have ever stayed in. Thank you Croke Park Hotel!!!",5,2015,09,16
211,Very good hotel,"Excellent room, spacious tub and shower, cleanest bathroom of anywhere I have stayed. Very quiet and comfortable beds. Staff was excellent. Close to town if you want to walk though the neighbourhood is a bit sketchy. Didn't feel comfortable walking back late night as a couple but felt fine when there was four of us. That being said I would stay here again.",4,2015,09,16
211,Exceptional Service,"I stay at this hotel regularly and each time I return the experience is better than the last. The staff go way beyond what could be expected from staff at such a busy hotel. On my recent stay Helen, Orla and Evita did just that and I am in their debt. Nothing is too much trouble and having stayed in many hotels in Ireland and Europe, The Croke Park is the one I always look forward to returning to. Seán Reid personally ensures the comfort and satisfaction of guests and I highly recommend this hotel.",5,2015,09,16
211,Fabulous stay!,"I thoroughly enjoyed my entire stay at the hotel. The staff was very friendly and helpful. The room was spacious and very clean. There were nice personal touches like a hand written welcome letter and a fresh plate of fruit. Big bathroom with a separate bath and walk in shower.
The only slight complaint might be that it's not right in the centre and is in an area where it is a bit dodgy to walk out at night on your own. But it's a short drive or taxi ride into the centre, so not terrible.",5,2015,09,16
211,Luxury hotel in great location,Gorgeous hotel with helpful staff. Very close to Dublin city centre. Great deals available on room prices. Perfect for a short stay in Dublin. Room was very big and lovely and clean. Lovely at Christmas with huge tree and decorations around hotel. ,5,2015,09,15
211,Not a 4 Stars Hotel,"I stayed at the Croke Park Hotel in August.
Pros:
- The staff was friendly and professional
- The Executive room was clean and spacious as well as the bathroom
- Room key in the elevator to access the room floors
Cons:
- The furniture in the room was old and damage
- The bathrobe was frayed
- The water pressure was low in the shower
- The bed was on roller wheels that didn't have locks. It kept moving every time I sat down
- The hotel is situated 20/25 mn from the city center, all the taxi rides add up. Also it didn't feel a safe neighborhood at night
- The room seemed to get a little hot at night",3,2015,09,15
211,Excellent hotel,"This is an excellent hotel situated on the outskirts of Dublin which is approximately 10 minutes from the city centre easily accessed by taxi costing about 10-15 Euro - the front desk will call a taxi for you and it arrives in less than 5 minutes usually.
The hotel is modern, spacious and very comfortable and the rooms are large well equipped and clean.
All aspects of our stay were extremely positive and the 4th floor rooms with access to the executive lounge truly excellent including a free continental breakfast each day and a voucher for a free drink per person per night in the bar.
The hotel location may not suit everyone and some of the bar staff are quite slow but these are minor points and should affext the overall review.",5,2015,09,15
211,Fantastic,"I stayed for one night with my husband and daughter.  Everything was beautiful, great room, shower etc.  toiletries and service.  Would definitely recommend and will go back.  
Very helpful when we enquired about Croke Park Tour and were able to leave our car there until we were ready to leave the following day after tour.  Also I asked for a high level room and we got one directly across from Croke Park Stadium.",5,2015,09,15
211,Business trip,"Very friendly staff when checking in. I was there meeting for business and found a lovely corner in the library off reception. We had a day long meeting there and there was no problem having our meal there as we worked. It did get chilly in the evening down in library area. 
Food was good but  on the expensive side. Service was slow but we're given comp tea and coffee for delay. Desserts had to be returned as we're not fresh. 
2 glasses of wine in the bar were 17€ very expensive. 
Room was lovely bathroom was spotlessly clean.  
Didn't sleep well bed was hard and pillows too soft. But that's just my preference. 
Breakfast was excellent so much choice full Irish cereals fruit yoghurt juices pastrys it was lovely. 
Very helpful porter Chris helped us with our extra luggage couldn't have been nicer. 
Perfect hotel for what we wanted very corporate styled",4,2015,09,15
211,Fantastic,"Stopped here to round off our anniversary trip. I cannot fault anything about this hotel. The staff are brilliant nothing is too much trouble . The food served in the bar and bistro restaurant is well worth a try.
A really nice touch was the wine sent to our room to wish us congratulations on our anniversary. The rooms on the 4th floor also have access to the executive lounge which is a nice place to relax. Will definitely stay again.",5,2015,09,14
211,Great service!!,"This place, besides being a nice place to stay has great service! We got in from our flight at 5:00 am with no place to go and dead tired. They found two rooms for us sooner than we should ecpect. Also I cannot say enough about the Concierge ""Krishna"", he was so unbelievably helpful, I only wished he was there 24/7. The only thing I would say is that this is across from the stadium that has games regularly. On game days it is VERY busy. It is a ways away from city central, but they do provide some shuttles in the morning and back at 4:45 pm.",5,2015,09,14
211,Clean and well-appointed with great service!,"I stayed at this hotel when I was in town for an important event. They were excellent about communicating before and after my visit. The room was immaculate and had everything I needed for a comfortable stay. I particularly liked the firm mattress, the bath and shower, the high-end products, and the helpful desk staff. Although the location was a bit out-of-the-way for where I needed to be, I loved the free parking (validated at the end) and the facility.",5,2015,09,14
211,Great Hotel and Location in central Dublin,I was very impressed with the Croke Park.  The staff throughout the hotel were great.  The room was large and very comfortable and the food in the Sideline Bistro was very well prepared and at an excellent price. The hotel is also well priced.  The hotel is a short walk or taxi ride to the sites in the city centre. Would definitely recommend the hotel.,5,2015,09,13
211,Excellent Hotel,Our visit was in a de luxe room on 4th floor giving us access to the Executive Lounge with all its complimentary benefits. Every aspect of this hotel was very comfortable and enjoyable and all staff were always attentive and friendly. The service delivery was extremely competent and attention even to tiny details ensured that the comfort and delight of its users. I thoroughly recommend this hotel. ,5,2015,09,12
211,Excellent,"Good room, good service, good location, good breakfast and all spotlessly clean.  There is no more that needs to be said but 200 characters are required which does put one off bothering to review in future.
      
      ",5,2015,09,12
211,very good Town hotel not to far from center  very good value for money,"very good town hotel not far from center   very good value for price paid.
Large clean room. very friendly and helpful staff in the hotel.  EUR 5.- by Taxi to the center of the town of Dublin. just  TV was a bit small for the size of the room",5,2015,09,12
211,"Nice modern hotel - an an ""iffy"" neighborhood","We were booked on a tour to explore Ireland and the Croke Park was the starting point.  Since we, and another couple, decided to arrive a day early we booked another night at the Croke Park.  The hotel was quite nice with modern rooms, good Wifi and good restaurants.    The hotel is in an ""iffy"" neighborhood and it is not recommended to go out on long walks after the sun sets.  

HOWEVER - that was not a problem this time since what we didn't know was that the hotel was directly across from the sports stadium and that 85,000 people were there for the ""semi-finals""   Every PUB was filled to the brim and walking around was fine since there were so many people.",4,2015,09,11
211,Modern and Clean,"I recently stayed 4 nights at The Croke Park Hotel. Upon arrival I was greeted by  friendly staff who offered a warm towel and a complementary beverage. My room was very clean and spacious. The bathroom was large and included a separate bathtub and shower, which was refreshing after a long day of sightseeing. Raj (the concierge) was extremely helpful and knowledgeable about the area. He made a few recommendations (i.e. The Irish Whiskey Museum) that turned out to be highlights of my holiday in Ireland. I had breakfast and lunch in the hotel restaurant. The food was outstanding. I highly recommend staying at The Croke Park Hotel.",5,2015,09,11
211,Great rooms and great service,Our room was quite comfortable and the service in the hotel was fantastic.  They were very helpful in assisting us with getting from place to place and using the local transportation systems.  The food at the hotel for breakfast was excellent.  They had a varied buffet with plenty of item to choose from.,5,2015,09,11
211,Stunning,Beautiful hotel we were on executive floor and had breakfast in the executive lounge there was lots of food to choose from rooms are large and extremely comfortable it's like home from home for us same mattresses we sleep on couldn't find one single fault staff are friendly and helpful just love the place it's gorgeous will definitely come back here in the future that's for sure simply excellent,5,2015,09,11
211,The best of everything at The Croke Park Hotel,"Wonderful staff, impeccable cleanliness, good food and a convenient location makes The Croke Park an easy choice for me when I visit Dublin.  Consistency in all of the above is a rarity to find, but  I have found it this establishment. Highly recommended.",5,2015,09,11
211,Welcoming and Relaxing Hotel,After a long day of sightseeing it was very good to know a comfortable and quiet room was waiting for us.  The food at the Sideline Bistro and Bar was excellent and we enjoyed breakfast in the executive lounge.,5,2015,09,10
211,Outstanding all round!,"Well people. What can I say! What a little beauty this was. Stunning hotel, spacious rooms. gorgeous food and wine. Staff could not have been more helpful. They really made it one to remember.  Location is a little out of it but this did not make a difference to our stay. Just amazing! I would recommend to anyone who will listen to me!",5,2015,09,10
211,Perfect stay,"Hotel, location, food, staff all excellent
Would highly recommend this hotel to all visiting Dublin
It is centrally located and ideal for airport and city centre
It is across the street from gas head quarters, the 3rd largest stadium in Europe

211,Perfect business stay,"Quiet
Very nice persons: Counter, room service, bar, ...
Good bar area, good variety of drinks, perfect area to meet+greet.
Rooms very clean and with a luxury intereur.
Not far to temple-bar (taxi) or the stadium (directly at the same street)
",5,2015,09,09
211,Great Hotel right near Croke Park,Overall a great hotel. This was a modern spacious hotel which had all of the amenities. The hotel staff were very friendly and attentive.  They provided little extras such as a bottle of water when you check in or out. The beds were very comfortable. The price was very reasonable as well.,5,2015,09,08
211,"Very Pleasant hotel especially close to Stadium, Airport and Ferry","This hotel was a last night stay in Ireland before our ferry back to UK the following morning.  A large modern hotel opposite the stadium, so if you are going there, this is  just a walk across the road.  It is also close to Dublin ferry port and the Airport, the airline crews stay here.  Good quick check in and underground parking.  The bathroom had the best lighting we have encountered in a modern hotel, top marks.  Very comfortable bed and adequate seating and all facilities.  Only problem was the view from the window.  340 overlooked the rubbish bins, a dirty canal, the railway line and a wall full of graffiti.  I imagine those in same position on different floors will have the same view.  We went to the bar, but found it too noisy for us, a huge screen with sports on it as you would expect bearing in mind it's location.  We ate in the restaurant which was quieter and had excellent service and were very pleasantly surprised with one of the best meals we enjoyed whilst in Ireland.  Well done, my salmon was cooked to perfection, lovely and moist with a wonderful sauce.  My husband said his steak and chips were the best in Ireland, praise indeed.  Thank you very much for ending our trip on a high note.  Breakfast next morning was excellent, being served from 6:30am onwards.  A first as most other hotels didn't start serving breakfast until 8:00am.  A first for me was the honeycomb that you could help yourself to, plenty of fresh fruits and all the other usual selections.",5,2015,09,07
211,Lovely stay,"I was nicely surprised by the quality of this hotel. With the deal that I got compared to the prices of other hotels on the date we stayed, I wasnt expecting much. The hotel is very modern and comfortable. The beds are very large & comfortable. We recently stayed in a 5 star hotel, and this place blew it out the water for comfort, cleanliness & decor. I thought the plush carpets in the hallways of the hotel were a nice touch.

We will definitely return.",5,2015,09,07
211,"Very comfortable, fresh and friendly","I was not expecting much as we were staying for only one night, but I was blown away with the friendly service and the quality of the hotel. We arrived quite late straight from the airport and were greeted with warm hand towels and very efficient service at the reception. The room was spacious, clean and had everything we needed. The bed was huge and very comfy. We got to leave our bags for a few hours as we went in to town and we even got bottles of water to go from the reception. It is a fair walk to city centre but Drumcondra station is close by with trains and buses going to city centre and airport frequently. Top quality hotel for an affordable price, highly recommended!",5,2015,09,07
211,Comfortable Room and Delicious Breakfast,"We had been in touch though email with the hotel prior to our visit and received quick responses to our questions. As it was not clear what nights they were offering to book us in for we ended up booking part of our stay though the hotel's website (in a queen room with an exclusive offer) and the first night through Expedia (for a double plus twin room) as there was no availability showing for that night on the hotel's website. We did inform the hotel through their preference forms that we had two bookings. Prior to arrival the hotel sent very informative emails concerning traffic and access to the hotel as the GAA semifinals were taking place at the stadium across the street.

The taxi for the airport was quick and checking in was efficient. We were upgraded from a queen to a king room and they were aware of our two bookings and we did not have to change rooms after the first night - this was much appreciated as the hotel was very busy due to the GAA event! 

Our booking included the full breakfast which had several hot buffet options. You could also order porridge, omelettes, and pancakes but we were not aware of this until our second visit for breakfast when the server informed us. The porridge was delicious and very filling so the next time we ordered we asked for half portions. The omelettes were excellent and fluffy - almost like small frittatas! The honeycomb was a nice surprise and interesting way to provide delicious honey. 

Also included in our booking was access to the executive lounge which offered a continental breakfast and later in the day had a jar of cookies out. We can't say if anything else was offered during the day as we were not at the hotel once we left after breakfast and typically returned later in the evenings. The lounge had a nice automatic coffee machine that made a variety of coffee styles including cappuccino and americano which was great after a long and sometimes chilly day spent exploring Dublin.

We only went to the hotel bar one night for drinks and a bite to eat. Although our server was very personable and the bar was not very busy the service was slow. As we only went the one night this may may been a one-off and an exception to typical experiences. 

Our room was very comfortable and quiet. The shower was excellent with lots of pressure and hot water and lovely toiletries. Housekeeping was very efficient and the room was very well maintained. 

Overall staff were very friendly and helpful. Some highlights were Jessica who served us several times both at the executive lounge and during breakfast, Catherine who wrote us a note and provided prosecco in our room to celebrate our anniversary, and the gentleman in concierge (whose name we did not get) who provided us with excellent tips for on the hop on hop off bus and excellent directions and suggestions.

We would walk into the city centre every morning and if returning early enough we would walk back but after dark we would use a taxi. It would take us approximately 20 minutes to walk to O'Connell street. A taxi from the stand on O'Connell street would run between 7-8 €. 

The hotel offers good value for money with the high level of accommodation and quality of breakfast. Location may be a drawback depending on your preferences as we can now say we would have preferred being in a more central location but if you prefer being outside of the noise and bustle of the city centre or heading to an event at the stadium then Croke Park Hotel would be a great choice!",4,2015,09,06
211,Its where to start and stay,"Just as my title states, not sure where to start; one of all time favorite places to stay in the world! The staff and service is a shinning example of how hospitality should be anywhere you go. The team throughout the hotel is on point. I like to give a special mention to the ladies Orla and Helen who made our trip just a wee bit special. 

The rooms itself our just perfect, the bed was heavenly and the comfort rivals any bed that can be muster against it. Just perfect. Try the food in the restaurant bistro, you cant go wrong here as well. The concierge service is just lovely. Easy parking underneath the hotel for our vehicle and so convenient to the center of the city.

Thanks for having us!",5,2015,09,06
211,Mr Ellis ,"Great hotel friendly staff and great food. Thouroly enjoyed the 4 day stay. Would definitely return. Situated in a great spot especially if you like football  (Gaelic of course ).Fantastic tour around the skyline at Croak Park. A short bus trip into the city centre a open top tour bus is a great way of getting around for only 10 euro. The Gaol is a must see and of course the Guinness factory not to mention the Jameson distillery. Lots of restaurants and bars old and new. Culture everywhere you look. Most definitely worth a return visit for everyone. 
",5,2015,09,04
211,Mrs s Ellis ,"Just returned from croke park hotel had the best time ,the staff were so friendly and helpful the rooms were lovely and food delicious weather it be in the restaurant or bar snacks. When I return to Dublin will most definitely stay they again. ",5,2015,09,04
211,everything you would expect from a 4* city hotel,"Great breakfast, very comfy bed with lovely bedding and spacious bathroom.  15 min walk to city centre or courtesy shuttle bus.  Quiet location (did not stay when the stadium was in use). Friendly and courteous staff.",5,2015,09,03
211,Great rooms and excellent staff,"My husband and I spent four nights at the Croke Park Hotel for our anniversary. We loved staying there. The rooms are well laid out and the sleeping area and bathroom are spacious. It's outside the city center and so it was nice and quiet for sleeping. The desk staff and concierege are helpful and friendly in a genuinely kind way, it doesn't seem forced or fake. If you arrive before your room is available, they can lock up your luggage. Things got a crowded during the football match. At first we didn't quite know what to think, but being from an NFL city in the US, it was fun to watch how fans in another country ""pre-game"" for the big match-up. The hotel handled crowd control and security spectacularly. The Irish breakfast is fabulous. I recommend dinner at the Sideline Bistro in the hotel as well. Don't walk to the city center. Learn how to use the dublin bus app or get tickets for the hop on hop off bus.

If you're visting from out of country, take the Croke Park tour and visit the GAA Museum. It's right across the street and is absolutely worth it.

Since we're visiting a different country every anniversary, I don't know that Dublin will be in our travel plans again for a number of years. But if it is, my husband and I 100% agree we are staying here.",5,2015,09,02
211,"Good location, friendly staff, good food.","As a flight attendant, this is my third time here and I have found the staff to be very friendly and helpful.  The rooms are very nice along with being very clean.  I have had breakfast each time, and the food and staff have been terrific.
The location is such that I can walk downtown in 20-30 minutes, and if I'm not so inclined, there are restaurants and grocery stores within a 10-15 minute walk.
Overall I would recommend The Croke Park Hotel as a good choice.",4,2015,09,02
211,Great Hotel with friendly staff,We stayed here for 3 nights at the beginning of our trip and have nothing but good things to say about the hotel. The rooms were clean and very spacious. The staff was nothing short of amazing. We arrived around 6am and while they didn't have a room available right away they did their best to make us comfortable until they had a room ready. They were able to get us in a room early and it was a great way to start out trip with such great service. The hotel is a little bit outside the city centre but not a bad walk. We walked every day and it wasn't too much for us. I would definitely stay here again. ,4,2015,09,01
211,Very Clean and Comfortable,"I recently had the pleasure of staying a night at the Croke Park Hotel in Dublin.  I arrived around 9:30 in the morning and was pleasantly surprised to get access to my room so early.  The check in process was efficient, and the folks I dealt with were helpful and eager to please.  Though my key card initially didn’t work, the problem was quickly rectified and I was in my room within minutes.  The room was a comfortable size, with lots of desk space, good lighting and a comfortable bed.  The safe had room for a laptop and more.  My one small beef was that the fridge was of the type that if you moved anything you’d be billed.  These seem to be rarer than they used to be, and they seem like the opposite of a guest focused item.  The bathroom was large and was the cleanest I’ve ever seen.  The bathtub was positively gleaming.  Kudos to the housekeeping staff.  The WiFi was easy to configure and bandwidth was sufficient to support streaming video. The breakfast buffet was large and varied, with a wide assortment of hot dishes, breads, cereals, yogurt, etc.  One could also order the porridge, which is essential to get the true Irish breakfast experience.  The location is obviously perfect if you’re in town for an event at Croke Park, since it’s literally across the street.  It’s about a 15-20 minute walk to the center of town, which is fine for me, but might not be for everyone.  Cabs are easy to call using either Hailo or Uber, so you don’t have to walk if you don’t want to.  Overall a very pleasant one night stay.",5,2015,09,01
211,Hard to fault !!,"Stayed here many times on business and it is always spotlessly clean, staff are welcoming and the breakfast is superb if expensive. The hotel itself is not cheap so I guess that it is in line with it's charges. 

Ideal for Croke Park stadium but a way out of the centre and  in an area that is not one I would venture outside in the dark. Get a taxi to be on the safe side otherwise it is one of the best.",4,2015,08,31
211,"Lovely hotel, location depends on what you want!","The Croke Park Hotel is situated in the North oart of town. The local pubs and surrounding area are just that for locals and rather drab and univiting for tourists. It takes around10-15 minutes to walk into the more touristy catering areas where there are plenty of bars and restaurants to choose from. However, if you are a gaelic football fan the hotel is VERY handy for the Croke Park stadium, it is just opposite. 
The hotel itself is lovely, bar and restaurant are great. We stayed on the executive floor with access to the executive lounge which meant we did not bother booking a coked breakfast as the continental breakfast available there was plenty. Would recommend this hotel if you do not mind being a little away from the centre of Dublin.",4,2015,08,30
211,Good hotel - but too expensive,"The Hotel is good, but some furniture and interiors should be renewed. Rates are definitely too high! Staff is friendly, but their knowledge is limited to Hotel issues. Free parking facilities are very good.  ",3,2015,08,30
211,Excellent hotel,"excellent hotel, visited with a family of three, very clean, very comfortable room, very large bathroom,
exploring the city via green city tour bus, booked in the hotel

211,Great hotel,"Really lovely hotel . Food was great . Staff extremely friendly. Lots of extra nice touches . Little teddy for my 18month old on check in , we stayed at this hotel as he had temple st appointments so it's a great location for walking into the city . Bottled water for journey home on check out . Would definitely recommend here and stay here again ",5,2015,08,29
211,Brilliant hotel. Amazing birthday trip,"Boyfriend booked this trip for us for my birthday. About 20 minutes from airport so not too bad and there is an airport bus about 5 minutes walk away. 

Got to the hotel and the staff were helpful. Got checked in and went up to the room which was spacious and well equipped. Think we may have had an upgrade but not sure. 

Opposite the stadium which didn't bother us as we were going to the game. Hotel was very busy for the game but to be expected. Security was on site and after the game they ensured only people staying at the hotel had access. 

We got drinks to our room for free as it was my birthday which was a really nice touch with a hand written card. 
About half an hour walk to Dublin centre which was fine for us. cost just under €10 in a taxi. 

Breakfast was expensive and wasn't amazing but was ok. With plenty of other places to eat so not really bothered. 

The hotel was amazing and we would defiantly recommend. We even had an days wait for our flight and about two hours to kill before we went to the airport and they were happy for us to use the facilities even after we had checked out. ",5,2015,08,29
211,The only place to stay!,"Well I just can't say enough about this fantastic hotel.The food is fabulous (even being a vegetarian), hotel spotlessly clean all over, sparkling bathrooms with lots of toiletries supplied in room and the cookies are a lovely touch.What topped it all off for us is the staff who are just the best I have ever come across in a hotel, they are just all so friendly, accommodating and welcoming.The icing on the cake was when Helen the restaurant manager presented my little girl with a gorgeous croke park teddy during dinner last night for being so well behaved☺We were overwhelmed by this kind gesture which meant so much to us.This is the only hotel I wld stay in when in Dublin, looking forward to our next stay!",5,2015,08,29
211,The best staff in Dublin.,"I have stayed in some of the best hotels in the world and I can honestly say that Croke Park hotel's staff is the best I have ever came across. From reception to the waiting staff to house keeping..nothing is too much bother for them. I have stayed here in the last few weeks a few nights a week for work reasons and would grudge stayeing anywhere else in Dublin ever again! The food is also second to none and has a huge selection. As some of the staff have gotten to know my face it feels like a second home walking in the door being greeted by welcome back smiles and hellos. I would highly recommended this hotel to anyone considering visiting Dublin, and not just for its prime location!",5,2015,08,28
211,Amazing,The hotel was just amazing and the room super clean and well furnished. Easy to find and not so far away from the city center. Bus stops to reach in 5 min by foot (41 and 16) and same buses from the airport to the hotel (the cheapest way). Staff super kind. Booked the offer of the day so quality/price was just super convenient! ,5,2015,08,28
211,Dublin City visit,"Try to avoid arriving on a match day, the hotel is opposite the stadium and is used heavily by match-goers. That said, the hotel is very comfortable and the staff extremely helpful and efficient. The reception was efficient and generally quick to process. The room was spacious and comfortable. Room service was quick and efficient. The dining experience in the restaurant was extremely good. The hotel is well situated between the airport and City centre. Drinks in the bar however are quite expensive but this is probably cancelled out by the rate of exchange between pound and euro.",5,2015,08,28
211,Memorable Experience @ Croke Park Hotel,"What a Welcome from all Staff, Nothing is a bother as they will go out of their way to satisfy your every need and make you feel special.
Fantastic Room with Breakfast and Dinner Outstanding.
It is a must stay Hotel in Dublin for a Family Reunion or a Couples Stay.",5,2015,08,28
211,A good hotel for a stopover in Dublin,"We spent one night at the Croke Park Hotel as we passed through Dublin on our way to the North.  The hotel was clean, comfortable and had a decent breakfast buffet.  A complimentary drink voucher was appreciated, we were able to enjoy a nightcap before turning in.  The staff was friendly and helpful.  Although the hotel is a bit peripheral, it is an easy 15 minute walk into the centre of Dublin.  Good value for the price.",4,2015,08,27
211,Thanks for the Terry Bear!,"We (four adults, two children) stayed in Dublin for one night-and I am really glad it was at the Croke Park! The location (across from a HUGE stadium) was great and, since we were there the night before a big match, there were many guests sporting team scarves and colors-it made for a festive atmosphere. Instead of going into the city for dinner, we chose to eat in the bar of the hotel and it was a fabulous choice! The food was very good (pretty extensive adult menu and as well as a good kid's menu) and the portions were large. However, it was the people working there that made it so special-everyone was extremely friendly, especially Terry (sorry if I got the spelling wrong). Terry found out we were traveling to Galway the next day, so the next time he came by our table he gave us several pages he printed out with ideas for places to stop at between Dublin and Galway. A while later he noticed my six year old daughter was not eating her dinner (she is a SLOW eater), so he told her that if she finished her dinner he would bring her a surprise. The kid inhaled her food and Terry returned with a stuffed teddy bear wearing a Croke Park knit sweater (he actually brought two bears so my two year old could also have one). What a way to start our travels in Ireland! All hotels should have a Terry!!",5,2015,08,27
211,Perfect for Sports Enthusiasts!,"A fantastic hotel with extremely helpful and happy staff who go out of their way to help you and very knowledgeable about the local area, particularly in helping you to get a good deal. Comfortable, clean rooms with great facilities and a car park that has a lift leading directly to your room floor. Great bar with a huge tv screen showing any football that's on! Definitely recommend the Sideline Bistro - wow! The food is amazing - you MUST try the lamb! Highly recommend this hotel. You will not be disappointed.",5,2015,08,27
211,gaa semi final 2015," we stayed from Friday21st until Monday 24th aug 2015. friendly and informative staff. Friday and Saturday were relatively calm around the hotel and on sunday complete contrast the buzz and mayhem was unreal. extra staff available, security at a premium. children catered for with room service upon arrival back from the game despite the huge crowds that were in the hotel. Sabrina in the sideline bistro is a treasure to the hotel. rooms are well maintained we have stayed on previous times and the standards are raising all the time. breakfast has improved so much. you will not leave hungry all diets are catered for.",5,2015,08,27
211,"Nice hotel, good breakfast ","We enjoyed our stay at this hotel. It was a 20min walk into the city centre, there wasn't too much nearby but this wasn't an issue. There are normally taxis outside and they weren't too expensive to go to the Guinness or airport. Croke park is right opposite and is an impressive looking stadium. If I had known the Gaelic games were on, we would've gone but if I didn't know before I definitely knew after as the bar, reception and streets outside were ram packed with revellers after the games - still quiet in the rooms though.",5,2015,08,27
211,Everything you could wish for.,"A beautiful hotel in a quiet side street, with free parking when you stay there, just a 15 minute walk from the center of Dublin with excellent staff who know how to look after you, what more would you want. ",5,2015,08,27
211,Family break at Croke Park Hotel,"Thanks Croke Park Hotel for a very enjoyable mini break.  The hotel location was excellent.  We did the Croke Park tour, a visit to the zoo, a shopping trip and took in a game at Croke Park.  Excellent staff and very clean hotel.  Would highly recommend for a family mini break.",5,2015,08,27
211,Family break,Having dropped in to Dublin on way home from Kerry we stayed here before an all Ireland semi final but what a quality hotel rooms food staff 10/10 we were disappointed to have to leave hotel at all will definitely be back,5,2015,08,26
211,Really enjoyed our stay here! ,"Great hotel! About a 10 minute walk from everything except stadium but made up for it.  Spacious room and excellent service. Immaculate updated room. Concierge is great too!  The room and bathroom were much larger than expected.  Also was able to get 2 double beds for family, which isn't easy to do. Highly recommend! ",4,2015,08,26
211,Very nice hotel and accomodating staff!,"Spent 3 nights at this hotel. Arrived late after a long bus ride from Galway. Initial room (room 201) had a terrible smell in it. Informed hotel staff and since there were no other rooms available for that evening, cleaning crew was sent to better clean and deodorize the room and we were told we would be moved to another room the following day. The following day we were moved to another room which was great with no nasty smells. Hotel staff were very nice and even offered free breakfast for remainder of our stay for the inconvenience. Hotel is a short bus ride away from most of the main city sites and there is shuttle service to the Hop on Hop off buses. Breakfast is very good. Rooms are very large with very comfortable beds. This is the second Doyle property we have stayed in during our time in Ireland (also stayed at the River Lee Hotel in Cork) and am very impressed with these hotels and friendly staff. I will definitely stay here again when back in Dublin!",4,2015,08,25
211,Great spot for a stay,"We stayed here while on a tour. Lobby was inviting and not overwhelming. Check-in is efficient, clerk quickly solved small problem. Our room was easy to find, large enough, bedding comfortable, bath bright and well laid out. Well laid out desk area for getting work done. 
I did not experience food or parking. ",5,2015,08,25
211,Short stay,"I was more than satisfied with my stay in this hotel. Excellent breakfast buffet in addition to very good table service by staff. Dinner in both the bar and restaurant was delicious but the glass of wine was pricey. Staff were very friendly and helpful. My only concern was walking to or from the hotel in the late evening, I would recommend taxi service.",5,2015,08,24
211,Fantastic Service,"The service was exceptional.  The staff were so friendly and helpful.  All questions were answered quickly and they were so knowledgable of the city.
The room exceeded our expectations. Thank you for a wonderful stay
 ",5,2015,08,24
211,Great Stay For My Layover,"The hotel was about a 25 euro taxi ride from the airport, but I easily found the bus station (which took about the same amount of time-30ish minutes). Beware, they only take exact change; you might want the concierge to break a bill down for you. The front desk is very professional looking, but the first thing they do is ask you to sign a paper and then proceed to talk somewhat quickly while you're trying to read what you're signing. I probably missed a couple of things I had to re-ask later. Dinner in the bar was delicious. I don't regret staying in. Not that there's much choice, almost everything in Dublin closes at 7 and I was told going out would just be wasting my time. The breakfast was equally enjoyable. The honeycomb was an awesome surprise. Checkout was very easy. ",5,2015,08,23
211,Perfect place to stay overnight in Dublin ,I've stayed at the Croke Park before and did this time prior to catching a flight out to Norway. I've found the airport hotels rather lacklustre hence the choice slightly further away. Check in was very efficient and easy. I was given a great double room on the 2nd floor with excellent amenities and nice TV too. I had dinner downstairs at the restaurant. The selection was good. Staff took a while to get to me but that was because it was rather busy. Food was great and fairly priced too. I didn't get to use the gym/ exercise room downstairs as I was pretty tired - but I had an excellent nights rest in the comfortable bed! I was reliably woken up with a call at  6am as requested at check in. I had breakfast early - at 06:30 - which was included in the cost of the night. Really good variety and extremely pleasant staff at the early time of the day. Check out was a breeze thereafter. Once again I was very impressed with this hotel. I'll certainly consider coming back here again - whether it's before flying out or simply for a weekend in Dublin! Thanks guys. ,5,2015,08,23
211,Really good hotel ,"I just stayed one night but it was really good. The rooms are big, clean and comfy. The bathroom was nearly as big as the Hotel room. Loved it. The full irish breakfast is great, if you like a hearty breakfast. The staff was friendly and helpful most of the time. Had a ticket for the hop on hop off bus included, which I found really practical for a one day tourist in Dublin. There was also a Cocktail included. I had the non alcoholic one, since I still had to drive. The Cocktail was delicious. I would ve liked a second one. :)",5,2015,08,22
211,Fantastic hotel,"The great news - our family concurs with how great a hotel it is. Beautiful rooms, great towels, wonderful staff, great breakfast buffet. Location-wise, not going to lie, it's not perfect. No view (concrete stadium out our window). And we're walkers and we walked past lots of hotels on our way to our destinations. However, taxis were easy, and we loved having a car park easily accessible. So if being away from the city is okay with you, this hotel is completely worth it!",5,2015,08,22
211,Excellent!,"Excellent in every way.    Staff A+, Dining A+, Room A+.  Value A+

Minor concerns:   Be clearer that continental breakfast is included in price.

Travellers should know that it is about a mile's walk to Dublin center.  The hotel is right next to the stadium, but otherwise area is residential/business.
We found cab rides to the city center and airport well worth the modest cost even with generous tipping. 
",5,2015,08,21
211,A hotel to be proud of!,"Stayed two nights and had a fabulous time in the Croke Park hotel. Loved how close it was to the stadium and enjoyed the buzz of the place with the hurling game. The staff were friendly and helpful from start to finish, sorry I don't have their names - we were given hot flannels to freshen up on arrival and bottles of water for the journey home. We had dinner in the bistro and I have to commend the chef- the chowder was delicious and the roast beef was melt in the mouth with huge portions of chunky veg and roast potatoes. The room we had was a great size and spotless. The bed so comfortable. The bathroom was like new with the thickest softest towels ever. What can I say about the breakfasts- excellent quality- loved the bag of boiled eggs and the honey in the honeycomb- oh my goodness- pure quality and taste. Plenty of space in ground floor with great comfy seating and little alcoves- even has a little library! We walked into town one day, a pleasant stroll and next day got the shuttle for the hop on hop off bus- a great way to see the city. Definitely one of the best hotels in Ireland. Thanks to all the wonderful staff. We'll be back for sure.",5,2015,08,20
211,Brilliant hotel :-),"Great food, great location and great staff. I wish I had remembered the blonde girl's name on reception! She was excellent and a real credit to a friendly hotel! Met a reception, room was perfect. It was a late booking but what a find :-) 

Very pleased all round! 

Thank you x

211,Fantastic Stay,Exceptional hotel with wonderful staff. Have stayed on 5 occasions this year and have always received outstanding service. Would highly recommend as a location to stay. Look forward to returning soon!,5,2015,08,20
211,Superb service,"My husband and I stayed for 2 nights at this hotel. We drove 3.5 hours from Galway to Dublin on a Sunday morning because I was ill. We called on the drive to the hotel to ask if they knew of any doctor we could see on a Sunday . Lo and behold , upon check in at around 10 am which we were advised that a doctor was on his way. An early check in and service above and beyond was delivered to us in addition to wine and a card. Did I mention it was our anniversary. The staff are very friendly , extra helpful, rooms clean and neat and air conditioned. Would definitely recommend this to anyone visiting Dublin.",5,2015,08,19
211,Wonderful stay yet again,We stayed here again for four nights in July and yet again the services was second to none. Terry in the bar was fantastic as was the trainee Amy she was fantastic at every turn. The food was wonderful nothing was too much trouble. The breakfast in the mornings was just delicious and there is nothing they haven't thought of in the buffet. The staff here are like a family and treat guests with the utmost respect at all times. There is no doubt I will be back here again for many nights to come.,5,2015,08,19
211,Pleasant short stay in Dublin,"My family and a friend from abroad spent a long weekend in Dublin. Staying at Croke Park Hotel was excellent from booking to check-out. Nice and friendly staff, clean and well dressed rooms, good morning buffet and large underground parking.
Despite being a little too far from touristic city centre it definitely worth the money.",5,2015,08,19
211,"Exceptional Staff, Nice hotel","Although the check in took a little bit (we were a large group) the staff was friendly and go-out-of-their-way helpful.  Any question that we had was answered quickly, clearly and concisely.  And, almost always in person, not with a phone call.  They even arranged our complicated airport transport for us.  In addition ,if it were not for the woman who took care of arranging airport vans telling us about the wonky customs in Dublin we quite possibly would have missed our flight home.  
The rooms were pleasantly large and well appointed.  They had safes, stereos, mini fridges and very air conditioning.  The rooms were clean as well as pleasantly decorated. There was no noise from outside the room.  The blackout curtains sealed well and were very effective.  The bathroom was plenty large and modern.  It has both a glass shower (very clean glass) and a tub.  
The restaurant was small, as was the menu.  But the food was above average for a hotel.  We found it difficult to keep our water pitchers filled during dinner.  It was surprising when we were charged for our coffee (usually included with the meal plan we had) and we had to wait close to 15 minutes to get cream and sugar.   
All the common areas as well as the rooms were clean and well cared for.  Can’t say enough  good things about the hotel staff and their helpfulness.",5,2015,08,18
211,Middle of the Road Accomodation,"The location is a 15-20 minute walk from City Centre. There is no gift shop/convenience store on site. We were told the closest convenience store was 15 minutes away which was incorrect. Actually 5 minute walk. The bed is on castors and rolls when sitting up. A very soft mattress does not help my back. The first night we called for a taxi the next morning at 6:00 AM. Ten minutes before leaving we confirmed. No taxi until 6:15 AM. Day 2 a request for a 5:00 AM wake up came at 5:30 AM. Day 3, no wake up call request, they call at 5:00 AM and wake us up.The room is clean and well appointed and everyone is extremely nice. We wouldn't return despite the reasonable price.",3,2015,08,18
211,Royal,"Staff : absolutely lovely definitly devoted, service sense, high level of education about service. I asked them if they could dry some clothes for me, they arrived in 5 minutes, it was free. it has been done in 1 hour, they even asked me if I had sensible clothes, they anticipate. Every where you go, people smile to you, staff say hello everytime, in a sincere way. There are a lot of staff everywhere, everybody is able to give you information in a veryy friendly and polite way. Staff is very clean, they wear ties, even womens. It's incredible. There even is staff to look after your kids , baby sitter are available in the hotel. They are ready to give you tips about activities around, call you a taxi.

Break fast : incredible, you have all the full classic break fast european : honey, jams, muesli, cheeses, ham etc...
and you also have typically irish breakfast : sausages, tomatoes, baked beans, pudding. as soon as you are sit, a staff member comes to you you dont wait at all. they ask you for your drink tea, coffee. Tea is sooo delicious, so is the coffee. This is a high quality food. For toasts : they give you one very grilled toast and another one just grilled : that's perfect

Place  : inside is very very clean, no insect, no hair, cleaning is done every day, it seems to be new but there is a style anyway. Big living room at the ground floor. It's always clean. Bed is white as snow. Everything needed in the room : boiler, coffee, teas, even cocoas , sugar, cookies !

Bathroom : I ve never seen a as bathroom as clean ! just perfect, so white, so clean, so convenient.",5,2015,08,18
211,Excellent family accommodation,"Ideal location for attending the big match in croke park. Don't recall ever checking in to any other hotel around the world
and getting a hot towel to freshen up. Very good service and food in the bistro. Also a nice touch to get a bottle of water on check out. Would gladly recommend to others to stay at the croke park hotel

",5,2015,08,17
211,Concert stay,"Stayed here at Croke Pk Hotel for Ed Sheeran Concert on July 24th. Rooms were clean and comfortable and the hotel was very modern and nicely decorated. Price of food was very expensive and wasn't worth the premium paid. Drink was pricey too, and 7 Euros for a plain burger with no dressings or fries etc in the bar post concert was VERY Steep. Overall a nice place to stay and a lovely courtyard outside the bar to sit in. Very convenient if you are going to an event in Croke Pk as it is just across the road. Not a lot to do in this particular area though and not many restaurants etc that we could see. Not enough toilet facilities to cover the large numbers of guests/visitors staying for events, and a very long queue ensues. Difficult to get a table in the restaurant also so booking is advised, as they had difficulty in coping with the large numbers. We ended up having to order room service and pay the extra 5 Euro charge just to make sure we got something to eat before the event.",4,2015,08,17
211,Another enjoyable stay,My husband and I were attending the The All Ireland Hurling semi final in Croke Park on August 9th and we booked to stay that night at the Croke Park hotel. We arrived early on Sunday morning and we were allocated our room immediately as it was ready. Reception staff as usual were helpful. Our room was very spacious and spotlessly clean. We ate in the Sideline Bistro and the food was excellent. This is our favourite hotel in Dublin and it lived up to its reputation again on this occasion. Looking forward to our next visit already.,5,2015,08,17
211,Excellent Hotel and feel at home factor,Really enjoy staying here as the staff try to help as best they can. Its bear the town center (within walking distance) and also great for any event at Croke Park itself. Also the shuttle service to East Point is reliable and good.,5,2015,08,17
211,Modern Hotel & Great Service,This hotel was modern and so clean with great service.  The security guard at the entrance will help you get a cab and help you with whatever you need.  We ordered room service really late and the room was a nice size with a great bathroom!  Perfect night to end our trip in Ireland and out on the town.,5,2015,08,16
211,Great Hotel,"Was in Dublin for a concert and wanted a hotel on the north side , must say this was a good choice. The hotel is lovely and very nice staff, we had free parking and free wifi. 
The rooms are a good size with big bathrooms which have a bath and a walkin shower.
The food in the bistro was great, we really enjoyed evening meal and breakfast. There is also a gym which we didn't use.
 One of the people in our party was celebrating their birthday and had a lovely gift left in their room. We would look forward to returning to this lovely hotel.",4,2015,08,16
211,Nice Hotel Just Outside The City Center,"All in all a very good hotel.  Positives: friendliness of staff (we dealt with 8-10 folks and all were great), bistro (dynamite grub - see my review) , currency exchange, cleanliness and decor  of room.  Negative: ""temperamental"" elevator (you need to slide your room card in to access any floor above the ground and twice it didn't work - hint - it's not temperamental - either fix it or get a new one).  Keep in mind this hotel is  a 10 minute walk to the city center. We did not realize this when we booked it.  Not a biggie for me and my wife since we're active people.  ",4,2015,08,15
211,Can't recommend highly enough,"Enjoyed a very pleasant 1 night stay at this Hotel with 2 children. Beautifully & tastefully decorated & TV, Tea/ coffee, shower gels facilities...& beautifully & Luxuriously soft & fluffy towels. Oh & the beds, oh so comfortable. The staff were very pleasant & helpful too & the Breakfast Buffet & dining area lovely, relaxed & Hygienic. Thankyou so much to the lovely male staff member who brought extra tea bags & Chocolate drink sachet's for my kids to our room. This Hotel is very high standard & made my short stay in Ireland very pleasant & I'll be certain to stay there when I return for a future longer stay in Dublin. It may be of further help for people to know that its only 2.50 Euros Adult fare from Dublin Ferry port to Dublin City Centre on 'Moretons' coaches that you will find outside the ferry port.",5,2015,08,14
211,One night stop,"Stayed here for one night before flying out of International Airport. Staff were very welcoming and helpful. The room and general surroundings were very well kept and the restaurant fare in the evening was good. The buffet style breakfast excellent. There is a good business area where can go online and check email and I was able to print off items I needed to without charge. Two things let the place down. The gym was very sparsely equipped, I had expected something better of a hotel boasting its sporting links/credentials. The bar service was poor. The bar was not busy at all, there were plenty of staff milling around but none seemed minded to offer to serve. That all said, it was good value, the staff matched the booking.com price which I highlighted was cheaper and for a one night stay it met my needs. If there were a option between average and very good I would have scored it there rather than as average.",3,2015,08,14
211,Great rooms and service,"Clean comfortable pleasant hotel just 20mins from the airport by bus. If you want to see hurling then you are across the road from the stadium. Also just a 20min walk to Connolly station for the DART and LUAS tram services.
",5,2015,08,14
211,Disappointing,"Aircon was not working in a room for 3 people. Reported it to reception and no response after 45 minutes, called again and was told it was being fixed, never was.  Reported again on departure (unhappy), apology given but no offer of any compensation, given it was 200Euro for the night ......not a classy response by the hotel

",2,2015,08,14
211,Exceptional Service and Great Stay,"My husband, 18 month old son and I stayed here on the last leg of our five day trip through Ireland. When we arrived, we were told that there was a system error and the hotel had been overbooked, leaving us with no room for that night. The manager was extremely friendly and sorry for the problem at hand. He booked us at another four star hotel downtown, paid for taxi services, and booked us back at their hotel in an executive room the following night with a complimentary dinner. The Croke Park room was spacious, the beds were extremely comfortable, they provided a portable crib for our baby, and also gave my baby two teddy bears. Everything about this hotel was great but the location isn't in the heart of the Dublin city center. We would definitely stay here again!",5,2015,08,13
211,Croke Park Hotel,Stayed here for match/break away with 3 kids so had a room with 2 doubles and roll away. Staff very helpful / room spotless and spacious. Had breakfast and dinner food was top class will be back again great location.,5,2015,08,12
211,Visit with family,"Arrived early, reception staff very friendly and helpful.  Had breakfast and left cases then went to explore the city.  Room ready upon our return.  We had a room overlooking Croke Park, room very quiet on an evening, no road noise and very restful sleep.  Aircon helps in summer months.  Staff throughout the hotel are very friendly and nothing is too much trouble. Breakfast was excellent, food in the bar very good. All in all a lovely hotel, would visit again anytime. Try and fit in a Stadium tour, very interesting and staff there lovely too.",5,2015,08,12
211,Enjoyed every minute!!,"Very relaxed, affordable and clean hotel. We chose the visit Dublin deal which included hop on hop off bus (which leaves just outside the door)  and a house cocktail. Very comfortable beds and I honestly think this was the best nights sleep I have ever had in a hotel!

We ate in the bar and I can highly recommend the chicken and mango salad. Breakfast offered a wide selection and staff couldn't have been more attentive and willing to help. Check in staff particularly friendly and helpful. We were also delighted by the surprise gift in our room because we were celebrating an anniversary. We will definitely be back and can certainly recommend this hotel to Dublin visitors.",5,2015,08,12
211,Lovely Hotel and Great Staff,Stayed at the Croke Park Hotel during a short weekend break in Dublin. It is out of the city centre but only 15 minute walk away. We used the Aircoach (ticket booth immediately outside terminal) for 10 euros return. It is a 20 min. ride and stops 200 yards away from hotel (bus driver will tell you where to get off). Recommended.,5,2015,08,12
211,First class,"This hotel has first class business accommodation, staff are efficient and friendly, parking is free and convenient to the hotel reception. 
I have use the Croke Park hotel in the past and will certainly use again.",5,2015,08,12
211,Wonderful,Very good service and high quality rooms. Very friendly staff and 20 minutes away from centre. 20 minutes from airport by car. Breakfast very good and reasonable price. Close to stadium but that didn't bother us. Car hire in same street.,5,2015,08,11
211,Even better than last year!,"We stayed at the hotel last year for the Dublin Half Marathon and it was a lovely hotel with beds so nice we went straight out and bought a new one when we got home! Returning this year, stating back at the hotel again was an easy choice. Great rooms, facilities, food and staff. What more can you ask for from a hotel. Hoping to back in Dublin next year and, if so, we'll be staying here. A great hotel.",4,2015,08,11
211,"Awesome staff, wonderful hotel!","I stayed at this hotel for 4 days on my trip to Dublin and loved it. I had a wonderful experience!!! The staff was very friendly and extremely helpful, they were quick to answer any of our questions or requests and they provided great service. Especially, Chris (the concierge), he was very attentive, provided us with fantastic suggestions for dinning, things to do, and how to get around the city. Also the front desk staff, especially Jane was very helpful. The room was nice and big, the beds were very comfortable, and everything was clean. The location was great, right across from Croke Park stadium where we enjoyed watching a Gaelic Football game. Hotel is very close to public transportation and is only about a 10 minute walk from the downtown area, I recommend using public transportation if you are returning late at night as the area is not as populated as downtown. I would highly recommend this hotel!",5,2015,08,10
211,The place to stay when in Dublin,"Very pleased to find a hotel in an affordable price range to accommodate our family of 4. Very clean well appointed property. While it was a bit out of the way for public bus and some restaurants (just a short walk) the property and all it has to offer more than made up for that. The ""Irish Breakfast"" served each more was fantastic as were the servers who brought you toast and tea. I wish there were more hotel properties in this chain for travel in the Canada and the USA. I would definitely become a frequent guest during my travel. ",5,2015,08,10
211,First Class Hotel and a Great Value!,We are a family of four and recently stayed at the Croke Park in Dublin. The reception staff were wonderful. The rooms are very spacious with large lovely bathrooms. The rooms had all the amenities. It was a good solution for a family of four because quad rooms can be difficult to find in Europe. Dublin town center is easy to access from the location. There was a lot of value for the price. The breakfast were equally as nice. We would definitely stay at the Croke Park again on future trips to Dublin.,5,2015,08,10
211,"Fabulous breakfast, great staff, super concierge",I have stayed at this hotel twice this month. The front desk staff is fabulous. I love the breakfast especially the whole honeycomb. The concierge is great at recommending tours and just helping with the bus. It is across the street from Croce park. The hop on and off bus and the south coast tours both have a stop at this hotel. It is a few blocks from bus that can take you to Howth the fishing village. It is $10 by cab to Tenple Bar.,5,2015,08,09
211,AS WELCOMING AS EVER,"We have visited the Croke Park Hotel on many occasions and it certainly never fails to impress.  As you walk in the door, you are warmly greeted by the reception Staff and it is such a joy to experience their check-in procedure.  A warm freshen-up little towel is always welcomed after a long journey and this awaits all their guests.  Check-in is so swift with the greatest of ease by the courteous and welcoming staff. As soon as Sean - the Operations Manager -  hears the sound of our voices, he immediately exits his office and warmly greets us as he does with all his guests.  Everyone is welcomed by Sean with his endearing smile and friendly banter. 
The rooms are immaculate in all aspects and the housekeepers ensure that everything is up to a pristine standard. We have had our evening meal on many occasions and the food in the restaurant certainly can only be described as a culinary delight.  Again the restaurant staff are very courteous and greet everyone with a friendly smile.  Checking out of the hotel is so delightful in that the receptionists wish everyone a safe onward journey and a complimentary bottle of water is always on hand for the journey home.  Car-parking is complimentary and the efficient concierge on duty immediately validates the car-parking ticket.  
It is always a pleasure to visit the Croke Park hotel in order to experience the warm and friendly welcome by Sean and all his staff.  We will certainly be returning in the very near future.",5,2015,08,09
211,"Good Place To ""Crash"" For Return Home","This hotel offers a very modern ""Euro-style"" look.  Across from Croke Stadium but a bit out of city center.  The ""Hop On/Hop Off"" does provide a shuttle service from the hotel to its first stop.  Rooms are a bit cramped but very comfortable.  Especially liked that it had A/C but did ask for a fan as room seemed to get a little hot at night  It also provided good toiletries (shampoo, bath wash and lotion) and an iron/ironing board.  Concierge was very helpful--especially in calling to arrange a taxi for us to get to the airport the following morning.  Bar area was large and well-appointed...food was good.  As mentioned in the title of the review, a good place to ""crash"" if you're heading to the airport for an early morning flight.  About 20 minutes from the airport assuming no/light traffic.",4,2015,08,08
211,Lovely place but food only ok,"We had the pleasure of staying here n the room,parking n staff were excellent n friendly. Room had 2 double beds n was clean n airy. We had a meal in the restaurant after a day's touring but the meal was a letdown as my wife had to return her selection as the potatoes were cold on the inside. When her replacement was served the potatoes were piping hot but the fish was now cold!! We were asked had the meal was n we told them of our dissatisfaction n were were offered free desserts which we declined n were given free tea n coffee. Overall a great place but would not recommend the meals there was another couple n child who were beside us n they were waiting 20 mins for their main course n they were not happy. ",3,2015,08,07
211,Great Stay! ,"We were very happy with our stay at the Croke Park Hotel. We flew in early and although we were not able to check in right away, we were offered a place to freshen up and a place to store our luggage while we went out exploring the city. 

Comfortable accommodations and a great staff! ",4,2015,08,07
211,modern and restful,"Good modern room and good service from all staff.Quiet (on non match days) location 10 minute walk from Parnell square and top of O'Connel street so near to all north of the Liffy sights e.g Writers museum ,Joyce centre etc.Another10 minutes and you at Trinity College,temple Bar etc.I also understand that the hop on bus goes by the hotel if you are not up to walking and want to see the sights.",4,2015,08,06
211,fabulous stay,"best hotel i've stayed in..everything down to the food to the staff was brilliant..rooms were spacious very clean.. we were up for the match and we were well warned about road closures, busy times in the restaurant.will def b back again and will be recommending to friends and family..",5,2015,08,06
211,Superb as always,"Great staff, excellent food and service and a clean comfortable hotel to stay in. Ten minute walk from OConnell street. Hop on hop off bus leaves from hotel entrance in the mornings. A perfect base for visiting Dublin.",5,2015,08,06
211,Best hotel I've ever stayed in,"We arrived in Monday 3rd August... Checkin not supposed to be until 2 but room was ready for our arrival at 11..... Reception staff were the friendliest most helpful reception staff I have ever met. We left our cases in and back down to reception who ordered us a taxi Togo into Dublin.... Taxi wS literally there within 2 mins.... A few hours of shopping and we came back to hotel to be met in reception with smiles from staff and a bit of banter ..... Couple of hours later a knock on our door ... Was room service with 2 bottles of bubbly wine for our anniversary and a lovely teddy for our sons birthday..:. Breakfast every morning has choice of cooked and continental.... Can have as much as you want... The food is gorgeous.... Had 3 course meal for us and 2 kids included in deal... So last night we are in restaurant... Again 110% satisfied ... Customer service in this hotel is off the scale.... I have to say I'm being totally honest when I say the staff give 200% to everything. The are constantly pleasant, helpful and have a smile for everyone.... We were here with my daughter and son and on 2nd day my son bought reception staff a box of cupcakes because ""they were so nice it made him feel like home ""... They were so pleased to be given them and even thanked him again the next day.... I can't fault this hotel at all.... Is definitely a gem and we will most certainly be back.... Think we have found our hotel that we will return to again and again..... I will recommend this to everyone.

Rooms are spotless, bed are so comfy, free wifi in hotel, taxi fare into Dublin is about €10.... Green hop on hop off bus picks u up right outside hotel....staff are amazing...

If you are coming to Dublin stay here... U won't regret it!!!!",5,2015,08,06
211,Great location on match day,A great location to meet either before or after a match in Croker. Great atmosphere and very organised even on the busy Sunday afternoon. Great place to go for a bite to eat! Menu could be extended though,5,2015,08,05
211,Superb Hotel! ,"Recently stayed here end of July to celebrate an anniversary. The room was lovely very spacious and clean with the most comfortable bed i ever slept. The Executive Lounge is such a nice are to sit down and relax while reading the paper and listen to good music. Front desk staff and bar staff were very helpful and friendly but if i had to mention anyone that would have to be Michelle in the front desk, very professional and friendly she went above and beyond to make our stay really special, excellent customer service! Would definitely stay here again and highly recommend this hotel. Top Notch! ",5,2015,08,04
211,Fantastic Hotel..!!,"We absolutely loved this hotel...one of the best we have stayed in......great little touches like the hot towels presented to us at check in...to the bottles of water given to us at check out. The room were big, clean and comfortable. Complimentary shower gel etc lovely..!!!....mini fridge...safe...iron...hairdryer etc.We thought the food was the best ever..!!..my compliments to the chefs...Staff friendly efficient and professional. We are definitely coming back....!!!!",5,2015,08,04
211,Excellent Value for Someone Willing to Walk 10 Minutes to Town,"A little off the beaten tourist path (unless you are a football (read soccer) fan), the Croke Park is an easy 10 minute walk to the Northern end of downtown Dublin (20 minute walk to town center). The value is excellent for those who request club floor accommodations as the breakfast, while continental, is substantial and the daily evening drink in the restaurant/bar allow one to unwind (over a good Guinness in my case).  Large rooms and very modern bathrooms only add to the value of this location.",5,2015,08,03
211,A great modern hotel close to Dublin City Centre and even closer to Croke Park,"A relatively modern hotel , which is part of the Doyles collection. It is heavily connected with the Croke Park Stadiums  owners the GAA, Gaelic Sports Association of Ireland. As there were some major sporting events at Croke Park that weekend of our visit, the hotel bars were full of Sports fans reminiscing about the earlier game late into the evening. The staff are really friendly and welcoming, and the concierge looked after our cases ahead of our room becoming available. You can walk the mile to O'Connell street which is the start of central Dublin, it is relatively flat. The dining room is similar to many other modern hotels, and the food and wine prices are relatively reasonable. You can tell that the hotel is not too bad as many airline pilots and stewardesses were staying overnight, and they don't stay anywhere poor. We received a complimentary newspaper and breakfast was plentiful. You must try the traditional Irish White and black puddings.",4,2015,08,03
211,"Excellent quality, friendly hotel.","We only stayed one night at the hotel, but would definitely return if we were in Dublin again. Our room was an executive room with access to the Executive Lounge which was a bonus. The room itself was large, the bed was comfortable and the shower was excellent. Everywhere was immaculately clean throughout the hotel. The breakfast was delicious and all the staff in the restaurant and on reception were extremely friendly and helpful. We were even offered bottles of water for our journey when we checked out, which was a thoughtful gesture. There is plenty of parking space and it's free to residents. The walk into the city centre is about 10-15 minutes which is fine, but we got a taxi back in the evening. I noticed that the city tour bus, hop on/hop off, stops outside the hotel. I would recommend this hotel.",5,2015,08,03
211,A hidden gem.,"If you don't have to stay downtown in Dublin, this really is a delightful hotel with maximum emphasis on customer comfort, from start to finish.  A very safe, clean and top-quality environment.  This was our 3rd stay, and I continue to be impressed by the efficiency and warmth of the welcome we receive each time. The staff are well-trained and attentive. WiFi was excellent.  The in-house restaurant had very good food, truly excellent value for money.  The Doyle Collection can be proud of this product.",5,2015,08,03
211,The Croke park Hotel a winner,"This hotel is about 15 minute walk to the heart of Dublin but it was an easy walk and or taxi's readily available. it is across from the soccer stadium, which if you are a fan it's a good thing if not I'm sure it is a very busy place.",5,2015,08,02
211,Vacation,"The facility was very nice. It is well run and the rooms are really good. The bathrooms are the best part of the room. Nice lounge, restaurant and bar area. great place to relax after seeing the city all day.",5,2015,08,02
211,Great Hotel,"Spent 5 days at the hotel with my wife. Had a lovely stay and would thoroughly recommend visitors to Dublin stay here. Maybe best avoided on days where ther is a concert or sporting event at nearby Croke Park stadium as it can get very busy in and around the hotel. We stayed in a Deluxe Room on 4th floor and cannot fault it. Spacious and very clean, with use of Executive lounge for your continental breakfast which we found tasty and plentiful. Only small criticism was the service in the bistro bar in the evening. A bit slow at times but the food when it arrived was very tasty. Also provided were drinks vouchers for a drink each evening.  All in all a very pleasant stay and we would certainly return if back in Dublin again.",5,2015,08,02
211,Better than excellent ,"I cannot fault this hotel and from what I saw in the area I know I made a good choice. The room was clean, spacious and comfortable. There was a workstation and and area to eat should you require room service, the en suite bathroom had a bath and a shower, the shower was spacious and the water was hot. 
Food is reasonably priced, we tried a few things from the menu and was not disappointed. Breakfast was good and a decent price. We had dinner twice and it was excellent, well presented and of high standard.
Staff were very helpful and very accommodating.
The hotel is not too far from the city centre, a 10-15 min walk away.
I will be sure to book this hotel again the next time I am in Dublin. 
Although there is no airport transfer from this hotel we used the air coach and the stop is a 5 min walk away. Easy to find.",5,2015,08,02
211,Excellent hotel,"A very friendly, smart comfortable hotel just a short cab ride from the city centre. Just loved the bed so comfy. The Dublin Tour Green bus picks you up right outside and drops you back, latest around 7pm. The fish and chips was very good as was the Guinness.",5,2015,08,01
211,Great stay in a lovely hotel,"Stayed here for a birthday treat away.  Lovely clean hotel and large comfortable room.

All staff were excellent, always friendly and helpful.  

Fantastic breakfast buffet.  Executive lounge a nice touch also.

We stayed two nights but wished we had stayed longer, we will be back again.  ",4,2015,08,01
211,Beautiful Hotel,"By far the best stay I've ever had in a Hotel!! From check in I feel very welcome, the receptionist guy was so nice! Very friendly & chatty! Rooms were immaculate! Food was delicious! Staff went that extra mile to ensure you had an enjoyable stay!! All the small touches made our stay amazing! Loved our time here & will definitely be back!!",5,2015,07,31
211,What a Wonderful Hotel,"my mother, who is disabled, and I stayed 4 nights at the Croke Park Hotel. The staff were absolutely fabtastic nothing was too much of a problem for them to sort out. They advised on places to go visit and also helped sort out a mobility scooter for my mother. The room was disable friendly and made the stay all the more welcoming for my mother. Due to her limited mobility we also ate our evening meals at the hotel ... Easy to access restaurant and the food was glorious. We tried all of the specials they put on daily and it has to be said that the chef and his team outdid themselves ... Fab food and not too expensive so you can be adventurous and try things you possibly would not have tried before. I really cannot fault the hotel at all ... Super friendly welcoming staff who also took the time to share places you may want to go and see and very knowledgeable about disabled access etc etc we really enjoyed our stay and will definitely go back again. In my mothers words ""it's the first time in years that she has not felt like a burden due to her disabilities when we have holidayed anywhere"". We highly recommend the Hotel and its staff to anyone considering a break in Dublin.",5,2015,07,31
211,"Great food, great rates, and upgraded to executive floor","Had the special in the restaurant of Beef Wellington which was generous and fully flavoured, a real treat.  The room was an upgrade, big bed with plenty of room, and continental breakfast was provided free of charge in the executive lounge.",5,2015,07,29
211,So close to town without being in the middle of the craziness!,"I recently visited here with a group of family members, and we were extremely happy with the hotel. Staff are friendly, and with small children in our group, nothing was too much. 
 It is a busy hotel with a large number of football fans staying as there was a game next door that weekend, but it didnt affect our stay at all, if anything it enhanced the atmosphere.
This hotel wouldnt be in the most ideal location, but it is great value for money and lovely to be out of town but close enough to go there is you want. (would recommend getting a taxi after dark though)",5,2015,07,29
211,Great spot close to central Dublin,"Croke Park Hotel is a great find which is hard to fault.

The rates are reasonable considering how close it is to the CBD which I walked to (about 30 minutes walk).  The rooms are good and comfortable, there is free parking, excellent free wifi, great meals, a lovely lounge/pub, friendly staff.

All in all a great stay!",5,2015,07,28
211,"Typical Doyle Quality, Pleasantly Surprised","A little gem of a hotel, staff very friendly and rooms extremely comfortable. If there was one negative, the water pressure was a bit low in the shower and temperature slightly cold, otherwise a great stay.

There is a lovely ambience throughout the property, making it extremely confortable.",5,2015,07,28
211,Good hotel in not ideal surroundings,"We have recently stayed in that hotel for 3 nights. It is situated right across the Croke Park Stadium and this means the city centre is not around the corner and it is not really nice and cosy in that area. There is a little supermarket (Spar) nearby and also a pub, the hotel itself offers a bar and bistro. Service is great, parking and wifi are free and I liked the gym. The furniture in the room has seen better times and sadly it was not really clean, I found hair and dust mostly in the tiny bathroom, beds and toilette was okay. The mini-bar was well stocked, there was also a safe and a hifi-system incl. CD player. All in all we had a good stay but cleaness and area would maybe let me choose another hotel next time.",4,2015,07,27
211,Ed Sheerin Overnight @ Croke Park Hotel,"Excellent, we checked into the hotel at 1.30pm, our rooms was ready which we didn't expect, the hotel reception had already checked us in which was great.  We went to the Sideline Bistro for lunch & it was excellent, staff again very friendly.  Our room was a Twin and it was large with two double size beds over looking onto the front of the hotel. Spotless clean.",5,2015,07,27
211,"Amazing hotel, fantastic stay!!","Finally getting round to doing my reviews of our recent trip to Dublin and The Croke Park Hotel is at the top of my list.  Booked for my husband's 40th birthday in June and the hotel was great.  The location is perfect, close enough to the city centre but far enough away to enjoy a peaceful nights sleep (on a very very comfy bed!).  The green hop-on-hop-off bus picks up outside at various times in the morning which is very handy.  A taxi back to the hotel in the evening was reasonable priced.  The staff at the hotel were all so lovely and informed us on our arrival that we had been upgraded to an Executive Room which was such a treat (especially the two little bottles of Prosecco!) .  The room gave us access to the Executive Lounge where there were hot and cold drinks available throughout the day.  There was also free wi-fi that was very good.  Breakfast was delicious and plentiful and the bar was reasonable priced.  All in all a fantastic stay and we hope to be back again soon :)",5,2015,07,27
211,Unreal Hospiltality,"This hotel was brilliant for the night of a concert and would recommend the executive suite for future visitors.
      Was clean and very comfortable an an ideal location, the atmosphere from we arrived to we left was brilliant.
      ",5,2015,07,27
211,The Croke Park Hotel Stay,"Good hotel with spacious rooms and the location is very convenient for those who wish to visit both sightseeings and shops. Very polite staff, the food was excellent and very clean rooms.  Would go back to this Hotel. 
",5,2015,07,25
211,Classy Croke Park,"The Croke Park experience is is a template for consistent excellence. Consistency in warm, friendly staff service, consistency in the supports for business clients, consistency in cleanliness and quality of food. It's a proven 'All Star' in the hotel world.  ",5,2015,07,24
211,Excellent Hotel,"I recently stayed in the Croke Park Hotel while in Dublin.  The staff, service, atmosphere and food was of a high standard.  The rooms were clean, comfortable and the bed was very comfy.  

I would recommend this hotel and will definitely stay there again.  The craic was good in the bar at night also, there was a very comfortable outside area.",5,2015,07,24
211,Executive's the way to go!,"Fairly new hotel, right beside Croke Park Stadium - any closer and you'd be watching a game!

Only 4 floors - 4th floor being the Executive floor. My stay is based on the Executive rooms.  Carpet may have just been replaced cos it had that new look and smell. 

Free Wi-Fi with strong signal in room. Wi-Fi's open, which surprised me with this hotel - thought for sure it would be password-protected! Needed door card in order to get to the floor via elevator.

Room - card must go into holder at the door for electricity to be on. Had a king-size bed and an ok view. Room overlooked railway that runs alongside the hotel but didn't hear any trains during my stay. View of the Dublin Spire from the room so you know it's within walking distance to the centre of Dublin.

Walked from the hotel to the city centre but probably wouldn't walk it at night. Was there for my birthday and had balloons, a Happy Birthday sign and couple of bottles of prosecco chilling for my arrival - many thanks for that little surprise. :)

Breakfast was included with the room - buffet-style option downstairs in the restaurant. The earlier, the better - the longer it sits, the more it dries out (the fried stuff!). Good selection at the buffet - warm and cold.

Our room came with a free paper. There was also a 'turn down' service in the evening which came with free chocolates - yum! The executive room had free drinks (waters, juices, teas) available 24/7 along with fruit and snacks. Papers/TV/radio were also available there and a smaller version of breakfast every morning. Comfortable seating area to chill if you want to get out of your room but not off the floor.

We ate at the restaurant one night. Service was terribly slow - took over 20 mins to get waiter to take our order (and that was just drinks). We eventually (and patiently) had our dinner served and was good.

Front desk staff were very helpful. Would definitely stay here again.",5,2015,07,22
211,Best hotel in dublin,This hotel never fails from the reception to the room. staff are brilliant always so friendly and helpful. Food is of a first class standard. Room are so clean and plenty of room. Check in and out is smooth and very helpful.,5,2015,07,22
211,Spotless and comfortable,"Stayed here for two nights for our first ever trip to Dublin to celebrate a birthday. Got a bus from the airport to O'Connell Street and then it is easy to bus, taxi or walk to the hotel. 
Check in was efficient. We arrived very early so we had the offer to leave our cases until the room was ready. When we got to the room we found a lovely birthday treat of a couple of bottles of wine and a handwritten card. Nice gesture, these little touches are always appreciated and remembered. Thank you. 
Room was clean and comfortable and the bathroom in particular was spotless. Very nice complimentary toiletries supplied. They have a lovely aroma as does the hand wash and lotion in the rest rooms. 
Slept really well. Bed was very comfortable and no noise problems whatsoever. 
Very nice buffet breakfast. Perfect poached eggs made to order. 
Executive lounge is a nice area to sit and relax and listen to some nice music. 
All in all could not fault our stay here. This would be a perfect place to stay for anyone watching a concert or sport event at the Croke Park Stadium.",5,2015,07,21
211,"Clean, quiet accomodations","My husband and I stayed at this hotel for 4 nights. It is a nice hotel, with clean quiet rooms. We were happy that there was a hair dryer, coffee/tea in room, plenty of clean towels, and many soaps/shampoo/conditioner/lotions in room. The bar is nice with a fire place and large screen TV. There is a quiet library area to read or plan out your activities for the day. The WiFi was adequate, not great. Good enough to access email, facebook and tripadvisor. The breakfast in NOT included, but is discounted for guests if you PREPAY at check in. It is a nice spread of all the Irish breakfast items you can imagine. There is no pool. It is a 15 minute walk to city center, so bring your walking shoes!!",4,2015,07,21
211,Excellent service,"We were met with a very warm welcome, both from the staff and the form of a hot towel, which was a nice touch.  All staff were exceptionally courteous and helpful, especially when we requested a guest bed for our 3 year old daughter...the could not be more accommodating.

It was a great start to our extended vacation!",5,2015,07,21
211,A lovely hotel in the outskirts of the city,"We arrived very early on Sunday morning and unfortunately we weren’t able to check into our room as it wasn’t ready, although we were encouraged to learn we could leave our bags with reception, which was great as it allowed us to go explore the city unburdened.

Following an exhausting (although very interesting) day exploring some of Dublin’s tourist attractions, we were very politely greeted by the staff on reception and given the keys to our room.

There’s not much we can say about our room as it was pretty close to perfect! The bed was extremely comfortable (I wish we could have taken the pillows home with us!) and the room was cleaned to an exceptionally high standard every day. There was plenty of choice with the tea and coffee facilities, although my only niggles are that I couldn’t seem to find a hairdryer and that the tv had a tendency to have sound problems.

However, saying this, the bathroom was sparkling and having the choice between a lovely deep bath or a double sized shower is something we could definitely get used to! Towels were replaced as and when we needed them to be and the shampoos and such were of a good quality.

We didn’t eat at the bistro, but enjoyed drinks at the bar on our last evening. The bar had a great atmosphere and staff were very attentive, the complementary bar snacks were a lovely touch and we had a really enjoyable evening. Price wise, I would say that if you expect London prices (in Euros of course) then the drinks were reasonable.

Although the location was a little way out from the city centre, there were excellent public transport links as well as a shuttle bus available in the morning. If however, you enjoy walking,  then the hotel is a short 20 minute walk from the centre, the concierge will provide you with a map, which is a pleasant stroll if the weather is good.

A final mention must go to the lovely gesture from the hotel, which, upon learning it was my birthday, arranged for a couple of bottles of wine and a handwritten card be left in our room, which was a genuinely lovely and heartfelt touch.

We wouldn’t hesitate to recommend this hotel to anyone as it is a very reasonable price, boasting attentive, professional staff with great facilities and well kept rooms.",5,2015,07,20
211,Close to Dublin Airport,"The hotel is located across the street from Croke Park stadium.  The room was very nice, modern, and clean.  The staff were very helpful.  The food was average and expensive.  I bought the steak and it was chewy.  Sometime during the night of our stay people were playing loud music down the hall and singing.",3,2015,07,19
211,Great Hotel in a great location,"My wife and I are just back from another lovely stay at the Croke Park Hotel. It is in a great location and a lovely 20 min walk to O Connell St,if the weather is good. All the staff are excellent here. The Hotel is spotless throughout. Rooms a nice size. The Executive Lounge on the fourth floor is a great place to relax with tea,coffee,or a juice .The breakfast was very good and plenty of choice. Ideal for a match in Croke Park or tours of the stadium.
Looking forward to our next visit.",5,2015,07,19
211,Great place to stay in Dublin,"This is a great place to stay in Dublin!  Hotel is very clean & comfortable! 
Staff in hotel are very nice but I must mention one in particular.....Ian on Reception! 
He made us so welcome on arrival & couldn't do enough for us! This hotel is so central to everything! Looking forward to visiting again sometime!!",5,2015,07,18
211,Nice hotel,"Very nice and modern hotel, with good staff, good location, very good breakfast, very quiet even if there was a match in the stadium in front of the hotel. Nothing else to add, We recommend this hotel for a stay in Dublin.
      
      ",5,2015,07,18
211,Fantastic place to stay.,"Fantastic, clean and comfortable accommodations just a short walk/cab ride from central Dublin. As well, Croke Park stadium is right across the street, which makes it the perfect place to stay to watch a game.

The staff were amazing and the resteraunt was great. Highly recommend this hotel. ",5,2015,07,17
211,5 star service!,"Just spent 3 nights at this hotel. It was a really nice experience from the moment of online booking when the reservation was confirmed all the way through checkout. The staff were friendly, knowledgeable, and committed to going the extra mile to meet their guests' needs. We arrived in need of toothbrushes (I had left our electric charger at home) and bandages for our blisters, and they were quickly provided by the helpful staff. Once we arrived in our room it was a delight to see that it was impeccably clean -- absolutely spotless! The food in the restaurant and at the breakfast buffet was really tasty and they were even able to provide gluten-free options. The menu went into great detail to explain the ingredients and the wait staff was also very knowledgeable about how the food was prepared. I was totally impressed by this hotel. Definitely 5-star service at four star price. Sports fans will also appreciate the ideal location of the hotel, being situated directly across the street from Croke Park stadium.",5,2015,07,17
211,Excellent stay at the Croke Park hotel,"I spent 6 nights at this hotel. The service was more than excellent, the staff was perfect, and the room was very nice. Everything you can expect for that value. The location was not optimal for me (25 minute walk to the convention center) but I enjoyed walking under the sunny Dublin.",4,2015,07,17
211,Excellent Hotel,Great place to stay. Beautiful hotel. Staff were very helpful and rooms very clean. An easy twenty minute walk to the O'Connell Street Bridge. Stayed during the week and got a great deal including parking and breakfast.  Would definitely stay there again.,5,2015,07,16
211,Fantastic Hotel!,Just back from a 2 night break in this fantastic hotel - 10/10. Staff were so helpful and pleasant at all times. Our room was immaculate and extremely comfortable. The food was supberb and the kids loved their stay here. As we were in Dublin for our son's birthday he received a birthday card with a voucher for complementary hot chocolate drinks for us all - which was a lovely jesture and really made his day more special!  I would not hesitate to recommend this hotel and would definitely go back again.,5,2015,07,16
211,I'll have to think of a title.,"This review was going to be a 1 star, however as events unfolded, it has to be 4 at the very least.

The positives:
Clean, smart and recently refurbished.

The negatives:
Not close to anything except a sports stadium. The center of Dublin was a 1.8km walk. 
Minibar automatically charges adds things to your bill by simply lifting them out, although they do you discretion as I picked up a jar of nuts before reading the sign. As I clearly hadn't opened them, they did not charge
The maid took a towel of ours when we hadn't left any in the bath tub
Safe didn't work,
The smart card passes used to open the room door and to operate the lift were very temperamental.
The area was erring on the side of rough.
One could not choose to walk up stairs
On our last day, workmen started ripping up the hall carpet outside our room before we had checked out.
No pre-warning that the hotel was under refurbishment.
Our car was broken into in their underground car park*

We would like to thank the hotel manager for doing everything in his power to rectify the situation. On checkout day, we were preparing to give the hotel ""what-for"", for taking a towel and the workmen, but when we went to put our bags in the car we found the off-side rear-passenger window had been smashed by muppet thieves who clearly had no idea how to break glass. I don't know why they did it as there was nothing on show.

Anyway, we approached the manager explaining the situation and that we had a 400 mile journey ahead of us. He took our case very seriously and dealt with everything, he contact the Police, AutoGlass, arranged the hotel's maintenance man to cut and fit a piece of Perspex, had the car cleaned, put us in the Executive lounge for the morning and refunded our last night, profusely apologising for the workmen and towel that seemed rather trivial by that point. 

Would I go back? Because of the area and what happened, no, but I probably would go to another Doyle hotel if the management work to the same high standards of customer satisfaction.

The rest of the journey went without a hitch, traveling home through the amazing Snowdownia National Park.

Good value for money? Yes.",4,2015,07,16
211,Nice Hotel,"We stayed at the Croke Park Hotel for four nights while visiting Dublin. The rooms were comfortable and clean. Hotel staff were very nice and helpful. The hotel was also a 10 dollar Uber ride from the Temple bar area. Just an extra tip but we found the Uber rides to be much cheaper than the taxi rates even though they are the same drivers. They give a nice discount for using the Uber service as opposed to being picked up by ""calling for a taxi"". My only slight complaint would be the excessive fruit plates. The fruit plates brought to the room each night with turn down service were a nice gesture but we ended up with way too much fruit after 4 nights of new plates. Also, the fruit that was cut up like watermelon and oranges were in pretty bad shape after sitting out the entire stay.",4,2015,07,15
211,Great Hotel - 4 star experience,"third time in the Croke Park Hotel and  once again did not disappoint - beautiful hotel , great location - staff are friendly and professional. this is one of favourite hotels and I would happily recommend it to anyone.",5,2015,07,15
211,Not worth staying here! ,"Definitely not worth the money it's like a basic travel lodge! it's so far out of the city in a rough looking area. After staying in 4 different hotels during my visit this was by far the worst I will not be staying here again ever and I definitely do not recommend, ",1,2015,07,15
211,Good location for the match,"A very nice hotel with large and clean rooms. The location is close to the park which is the reason we have chosen our stay on several occasions. Of course this can mean it is noisy when the matches are in progress but that of course is not a problem if the reason you are there is for the match anyway.
The staff tend to be very friendly and the food is good. We enjoy the breakfasts but then eat outside for lunch and dinner. You can easily walk to the centre of town or take a taxi.",4,2015,07,14
211,can't wait to return,We stayed here last friday and can't say enough good things about our stay. Room was really big with 2 double beds and sparkling bathroom with really nice toiletries and very good walk in shower. I would like to thank Catherine for the lovely surprise of prosecco on ice left in the room to celebrate my birthday. Such a nice touch. We ate in the bar which was excellent before heading to fleetwood mac concert. The breakfast next morning was outstanding with lovely array of food and you could have omelettes/pancakes made to order etc. The stewed rhubarb and mixed berries was a lovely change from the usual standard fruits. The waiting staff were so helpful and will make any coffee you like if you don't like the standard pot of coffee. Already planning my next visit.,5,2015,07,14
211,A very comfortable hotel.,"I'd describe this hotel as ""upper business class"".  The staff are efficient, friendly, and professional.  My room was very comfortable, spotlessly clean and the bathroom had a large shower; bonus point!
The food in the bistro is very good and is complemented by an international wine list.  I particularly enjoyed the crab cocktail starter.
I can't find any real fault with this hotel.",4,2015,07,14
211,City Break,"I stayed from Thurs 9th July for 3 nights. The Hotel was the perfect location for the main purpose of my trip which was a preseason friendly between Ipswich Town & local team Shelbourne FC on the Sat at Tolka Park - about a 10 min walk. However, I made it into a mini break as I was going such a long way and I wasn't disappointed.

The staff were chatty and friendly. The facilities in the room were excellent. It was also very quiet and comfortable (best night's sleep I've had in ages!). Loved the toiletries! Was impressed with the wifi throughout the Hotel , which is free and very quick. I liked the fact that there was a bath and separate walk in shower. 

A really good feature of the Hotel (especially as a solo traveller) was the security. I wasn't aware at first that you had to use your key card in the slot in the lift in order for the lift to operate, or in the slot on the door to take you to the stairs. It is quite a nice walk into Dublin, which took about 15-20 mins and there are also plenty of buses to take you into the centre, as well. 

Although I didn't eat in the Hotel very often, except to have a light meal in the bar after arriving and the continental breakfast, I thought the food was of excellent quality. I would definitely recommend it as a place to stay if visiting Dublin.",5,2015,07,13
211,"Helpful staff, busy during sporting events","We accidently happened to book in here on a day where a final was happening at Croake Park Stadium - it was bedlam! However despite this the staff were incredibly helpful with getting us settled. We arrived several hours before check in but they happily held our bags and let us in to the gym to get changed out of our airplane clothes before hitting the town. We had a room on the executive floor that was spacious and luxurious, with chocolates on the pillows, and robes and slippers provided. We were provided with a continental breakfast on our floor which was great as we didnt have to deal with the sports fans on the main floor (we don't follow a lot of sport!) There is an undercover car park which is free for guests, just remember to validate your parking. A half hour walk into Temple Bar, but we were recommended to catch a cab home at night as we were 'north of the river '.",5,2015,07,13
211,Excellant experience.,"I stayed here with my brother when we were attending the acdc concert in July. The staff were very friendly and professional. The breakfast was nice too. A fine selection to choose from. I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone. The hotel also granted our wish for a Marty morrisey picture in hotel room upon arrival. Which amused us. Over all, it was a great trip and I look forward to staying at this hotel again in the future. ",5,2015,07,13
211,Excellent service ,"Our third time at this hotel and it will not be our last. Booked early so got a great deal. The staff are friendly and can not do enough for you. Recommend the breakfast to start your day off, everything you can think of is available. The rooms are very clean and decorated to a decent standard. Definitely coming back next year and bringing friends. 
A big thank you to all the staff, would not use another hotel whilst staying in Dublin.                                              

",5,2015,07,13
211,Great Hotel,"Was here before the football final on Sunday.  Great atmosphere, staff were excellent.  Also returned after the match, band playing in garden good buzz around the place.  Very clean plenty of room to move around.  Will be returning.",5,2015,07,13
211,An excellent stay,"This is a friendly, comfortable hotel; large clean rooms, good shower and bath, free, fast and strong WiFi, breakfast buffet (not individually cooked, but tasty), and free underground car parking.  I was on the executive floor, which has a large comfortable lounge, with fresh fruit, biscuits and fresh ground coffee available all day.  The only issue (and the clue is in the name - Croke Park) is that on a match day the noise from outside and from the bar area is deafening (I could hear it loudly in my fourth floor room with the window closed).",4,2015,07,13
211,Nice Hotel - Awesome Executive Suite,"This was our first hotel experience in Ireland.  The staff are super nice and helpful.  The rooms are spacious and very nice.  Somehow, my husband and I were upgraded to the Executive Suite status.  VERY NICE!!!  Breakfast in the morning in the suite included smoked salmon, meats, cheeses, yogurt, fruit and pastries/bread.  The hotel is in a little sketchy area but still safe enough that we walked into center city (day light).  It is across from the stadium.  On game days it can get very crowded.  Great experience.",4,2015,07,12
211,Very nice hotel,"Me and a friend stayed at this hotel last October, we both loved it! The room we stayed in had two double beds and a lovely bathroom. It is a short walk away from the main city. It was a good price when we booked it also.",5,2015,07,12
211,I like this hotel!,"I have stayed at this hotel 4 times over the last year and a half. I have never been disappointed. The rooms are decent size with comfortable beds. Nice and clean. Staff are quite nice. The wait staff during the breakfast buffet are very helpful and have smiles. The buffet isn't the best I've seen, but you won't be disappointed. I look forward to it. The porridge is quite good. The concierge desk staff are very helpful. The location isn't downtown, but we walked from the hotel and all around most of Dublin with no issues. Yes it was a bit of a walk, so we skipped our workout for the day and enjoyed it in town. I would recommend this hotel to anyone. It is quite nice!",4,2015,07,11
211,Last leg of our tour. ,"We booked into this hotel for a two day period before flying back to England.  The hotel is really well situated.  It is about a 15 minute walk to OCONNEL STREET.  And about a 20 minute drive to the airport. 
I thought the rooms were good but the bar area ok at best. 

One tip check to see what matches are playing at Croake Park before you book your trip.  We arrived at the same time a big hurling final was playing. It was a nightmare getting to the hotel and the hotel reception and bar area were rammed full of fans. ",4,2015,07,11
211,Great friendly hotel,"Great hotel with exceptional staff from receptionist, concierge, dining and bar staff and last but not least domestic services. Their happy faces and politeness was evident on every interaction we had with them. 

On arrival the hotel was full of visitors for the match opposite at Croke Park, boisterous but full of fun. The reception staff were efficient only one small niggle we were not informed regarding the re furnish meant on our floor. The only inconvenience was the fumes of paint and glue on the way to our room once inside it disappeared.

Breakfast had a great choice and cooked very well. Service was excellent.

Concierge service was very helpful with directions as hotel is a good walk from the city centre, it is a very pleasant walk.

I would recommend this hotel to everyone looking for a modern friendly place to stay and explore this brilliant and one of the friendliest cities we have visited.",5,2015,07,10
211,Amazing Staff. Home away from home,"This hotel is one of a kind. I stay here quiet often as I travel the world for business.This is one of the few hotels where the staff genuinely make you feel at home and oh so welcome. The breakfast is fabulous. Huge assortment of options to meet anyone's taste. Waitstaff is very attentive.

Rooms are clean. Beds are heaven. I can sleep for many, many hours in them. Never want to get up.",5,2015,07,09
211,Excellent Hotel,"Stayed 2 nights with family, secure parking, friendly and helpful staff, nothing was a problem to them, relaxed athmosphere. room spotless in every respect and comfortable.Breakfast absolutely fab, i like a good full Irish and that it surely is. Great location, good value, definitely stay there again no problem.",5,2015,07,09
211,Great stay!,"Stayed here while we were down for a night out, we were going to a concert in the Olympia, the hotel is in a great location, the staff are lovely and will definitely be trying to book this hotel when I am down for any matches! Have recommended this hotel to family and friends! ",4,2015,07,09
211,Excellent hotel,"I love staying in the Croke Park Hotel - great service, fantastic food (have had breakfast lunch and dinner here on a few occasions), very clean and comfortable, great atmosphere. We stay here because it's so close toCroke Park and the atmosphere on match days is fantastic. No negatives at all!!",5,2015,07,09
211,Very accomodating staff,I selected the Croke Park Hotel for one night visit based on the excellent reviews.  I made reservation for my family for one night while in Dublin.  Unfortunately my travel plans were altered very last minute due to airline cancelation.  The Croke Park Hotel could not have been more accommodating and helpful in making the bad situation better.  I would not hesitate staying in this hotel in the future and thank you so much for your flexibility and kindness.,5,2015,07,09
211,Fantastic stay,"Clean rooms, freindly staff. Just next to the Crok Park Stadium. It's a little bit outside of the City Center, but within a 10m walk or by bus it's easy to reach the Temple Bar or O'Connel Street. Could defenitly recomend this place",5,2015,07,09
211,Weekend away,"This hotel is about a mile outside of the city centre,  their are local buses available, but a 
Little bit of walking is needed. Make sure you have the right change for the bus aswell, as they don't change notes. The hotel itself is very clean and all staff were very friendly and helpful, rooms are quite big and comfy beds, lovely clean bathroom' views not fantastic, the stadium on one side and railway on the other. Not many places to eat locally, unless you take taxi to city or clontarf.. Overall great hotel.",4,2015,07,09
211,Croke Park Hotel Dublin ten mins walk from city centre,"Stayed here when there were two matches on in the stadium across the road. Even though the hotel was packed it was not noisy . The rooms are are really good size for a city hotel and spacious bathroom with both bath and separate shower. Only ate breakfast there, but what a breakfast, even had honey in the honeycomb ! About ten mins walk to city centre, public bus nearby and a taxi costs about €7 each way",5,2015,07,09
211,"Clean room, Decent sized rooms, Friendly staff","(Booked for a conference in Dublin)
Greeted by friendly Reception staff.
Room was very clean and quite new. High end toiletries etc in the equally clean bathroom.
Overall plenty of hanging space and enough room for the usual laptop, iPad, smartphones with plenty of charging points.
Bar staff were friendly and helpful. I arrived back at the hotel and wanted to know if I could get a hot meal. Even though it was nearly 10pm the chef cooked a veyr nice burger, fries and side salad. Great service!
With many folks at the hotel for a conference there was still enough space, and food(!), at breakfast. 
Minor downside is that you need you need to get a cab into downtown Dublin.
Overall a very good choice if you want a business hotel in Dublin with friendly staff.",4,2015,07,08
211,amazing staff,"the most amazing staff for my one day in dublin, they helped me with me little time and that to do in Dublin, the food at the restaurant is very good, and they always have a smile and able to help! thanks guys!",5,2015,07,08
211,Lovely Hotel,Stayed in this hotel now a couple of times. The price of the hotel varies but I guess for near the centre of the City it's going to be a tad more expensive. The Breakfast in this hotel is exceptional and a great choice for all the foodies. The staff are friendly and helpful but especially all the staff on the reception desk. The rooms of the hotel are lush and well maintained. The deluxe room that I last stayed in was very spacious. The hotel is only 10-15 minute walk from O'Connell Street and it's located across the Road from the GAA Headquarters Croke Park Stadium where you can visit the museum.,4,2015,07,08
211,Excellent hotel,"Brilliant hotel, excellent staff, good location and good value apart from Match days! Would highly recommend this hotel! The location is a small bit out of the city but is compensated by the quality of service and rooms.",5,2015,07,07
211,Next to Croke stadium.,The location is about 45 minute walk to center of town. The staff is nice. the rooms are very comfortable. We had views of the canal and a car repair place which was a bumer! The staff very helpful. We enjoyed our room and Dublin,4,2015,07,06
211,Fantastic Hotel Experience,"We recently stayed for one night before a match. I found the hotel to be excellent. The team on reception are so helpful. The rooms are spacious, quiet and really clean. Breakfast was lovely.I would definitely recommend the hotel. The price was also very reasonable for Dublin. ",5,2015,07,06
211,Best customer service ,I stayed here on the 26th of June with my mother daughter and step son we were up for my daughters birthday and the hotel staff were so good. They even left a present and a card from the hotel in our room ! I have never stayed in a place so lovely (it's the little things that make all the difference) keep up the good work ;) ) ,5,2015,07,06
211,My stay ,"Stayed here for two nights for a concert. But the concert wasn't at croke park. Room was lovely clean and tidy well presented only fault I have the shower was not really assesible for my partner if I hadn't been there he could not reach. Food in the sideline restaurant was beautiful well presented. Had the experience of trying the two places for breakfast and both were very good.
Only one minor hiccup when signing out was the taxi that we arranged didn't come into the hotel to get us leading us to think we were going to be late for our train bk North 
",4,2015,07,06
211,Surpassed expectations!,"We spent a delightful Saturday night at the hotel and were upgraded to the executive 4th floor. The room was spotlessly clean and quiet and the staff couldn't be more helpful and courteous. The only slight disadvantage was that the hotel is situated about a 15 minute walk away from the centre of Dublin. Against that, if you're a follower of hurling, the hotel couldn't be closer to the stadium!",5,2015,07,06
211,Faultless,"Stayed again....and will stay again. I cannot fault this hotel so far. Friendliest staff in a hotel with a genuine interest in the guests, especially the kids. Got a welcome pack for the kids with games/crayons and bottled water. They really make the kids feel like they are special guests which is lovely. Spotless rooms and bathrooms. Comfy beds. Really quiet hotel and we always sleep well. Short walk to town.
Buffet breakfast is busy. One idea would be to have a small table for kids to be able reach their choices but otherwise the choice, selection, etc is great.
We will be back again and I have stayed here for a number of years now and I have no problems at all at any stage.",5,2015,07,05
211,"Clean, friendly, comfy","Stayed here on business but I understand the rates are reasonable. Large-ish rooms, good showers, comfy beds. Staff plentiful friendly and efficient. A bit out of the centre of town but it isn't really a problem. Also on the airport side which may be helpful in saving time (hotel to departure gate took me 45 mins - couldn't believe it)",4,2015,07,04
211,Excellent stay,"What a wonderful hotel this really is, on a visit to Dublin we chose this hotel for the excellent trip advisor reviews and we was not disappointed.  First class service, rooms very pleasant and clean, complex facilities excellent.

A 15 minute walk to the City Centre, a small price to pay for an amazing stay in comfortable surroundings and a competitive price, we shall return for sure.",5,2015,07,04
211,Quiet and comfortable but unremarkable,"We chose this hotel for its proximity to the airport as we needed to be up for an early morning flight. The hotel itself calls to mind a Marriot; very functional but dull. The rooms and hallways are very non-descript but clean, and there is free wifi throughout. The front desk was helpful in both booking us a restaurant reservation in a fishing village we'd heard about around 30 minutes away as well as our early morning cab. The wake-up call we'd requested never came but luckily we'd set our iphone as a back-up. A decent lodging for the money but nothing you'll remember after you leave.",3,2015,07,03
211,Good hotel but...too many bus tours now use it,Overall a very good hotel and certainly one of the best on the north side of Dublin. Room to a good standard. Negatives: too many bus tours now use the hotel. Service can be very indifferent. Not great when trying to check in and a bus tour has just arrived in front of you. Increasingly the focus seems to be focused on accommodating more snd more bus tours which puts me off the hotel considerably when travelling for business. Food is surprisingly good but service is hit and miss. Good buffet breakfast but can me a challenge to catch waitress eye to get some coffee.,4,2015,07,03
211,Doing things with that extra bit of class,"Had an amazing time at this great hotel. Upon walking in to the meticulous foyer  I was greeted by a most welcoming staff. As the weather was sweltering outside the offering of some nice cold towels was very much appreciated to wipe the sweat from our brows. We were given our room keys and made our way to our room. The use of a room key to activate the lifts gave us that sense of extra security which is most welcoming in big cities. When I opened the door to our room I was greeted with the most welcoming of sights. The sun beamed brightly off the dazzling teeth of Marty Morrissey in my very own framed photo. I couldn't believe it. Having travelled up from Clare I had requested the one and only Clare Person of the Year 2015 in photo form and they delivered it in all it's glory. It made my day but that was just the start of a great experience.

As we had travelled up for the AC/DC concert taking place across town we new there would be a wait for taxis. As a crowd gathered at the entrance a member of staff rang for ones available whilst a colleague flagged some down for people waiting. They did their best to make sure everyone was accommodated in this regard which was of great benefit.

After the concert we made our way back and they were very quick in getting room service to us even though it was quite late. The food here is of top quality. The next morning as we had breakfast it was one of the nicest I've ever had. Coffee prepared any way you wish. A full Irish cooked to perfection and numerous juices,breads and cereals to your fancy. Nothing seemed to be too awkward for them to prepare and the staff kept enquiring if we needed more. Very attentive and friendly.

As we made our way to check out everything was done so quickly and efficiently it just topped off a great few days and this is one place that I will definitely be visiting again and I'd like to thank the staff for going to the effort of making the trip so memorable. Go raibh mile maith agat.",5,2015,07,03
211,Croke Park Hotel Stay through CIE Tours,Check in was very professional.  The room was superb.  The staff was uniformly friendly and helpful.  The food and drink was excellent and the wait staff was professional and made good suggestions.  The location was very interesting being right across from the historic Croke Park Stadium.  Transportation was arranged easily and was very prompt.,5,2015,07,02
211,Nice Hotel,"I have just come back from a 2 night stay in this Hotel. Very well presented Hotel, with pleasant and friendly staff, welcoming and comfortable area with plenty of seating and a nice library area. The room was clean, comfortable and looked very well. Nice comfortable beds and pillows. Overall the room was excellent. The breakfast was excellent, both service and food.

The only negative part was the restaurant visit. We ate in the restaurant for the second evening. We were a group of 2 adults and 2 children. The wait for dinner was just over one hour. The restaurant had very little people in it when we arrived, so not overly busy at all. Only one adult ordered a starter but we had ordered a selection of breads for the others. The starter arrived, but not the breads. We decided to be patient as we thought there may have been a bit of confusion and the bread would arrive with dinner. Little did we know that dinner would be an hour wait and then arrive with one slice of bread! The waitress seemed very confused and seemed to forget what she had asked us and what we had said re: orders. Most of the food was also on the cold side, it was cooked but just a bit cold by the time it got to us. The children ate theirs regardless as they were quite hungry at this point. The dessert was lovely but again took very long to arrive, whilst the table beside us, a group of 6, who arrived nearly an hour after us seemed to have very quick service.Now in fairness the staff acknowledged the cold food afterwards as it was not eaten and offered a replacement and were very pleasant but by that time we were just a bit fed up to be honest and the thoughts of another long wait for a replacement meal did not appeal to us, especially with 2 children in tow.

In saying this I would still visit this hotel again as the dinner really was the only issue. The actual hotel is really nice and the complimentary wifi and  car parking is an added bonus.",4,2015,07,02
211,Almost perfect,"We enjoyed our stay at this quiet hotel. It is true that it is somewhat excentrically located on the ""seedier"" side of town, or as the locals say, on ""the stilleto in the ghetto"" side.  This might be the price one pays to get good value for money. That said, at no time did we feel in danger.  Never once.  You can tell The Croke Park Hotel staff are proud of their hotel. It is extremely well-maintained and as clean as a hotel can be. In fact, they were in the process of painting the corredors and doors in our wing and we had a slight problem getting our door to open because the paint was still tacky. Seriously, upon our arrival, we had to wait in the lobby for the paint to dry on our door! Needless to say, we were tired and just wanted to unpack, not wait for paint to dry....The room was great. Clean, comfortable, decorated simply but impeccably. I loved it.  I didn't love that there was no hair dryer to be found. Wonder what that was all about?  The room cleaning staff were extremely efficient - the best I've ever had.  They all merit salary increases.  Breakfasts were excellent, both hot and cold. Service was terrific. I think the cd they played one morning was broken and no one but me noticed. It wasn't loud so I could mostly forget about it.  I loved the way each wait staff member had his/her city of origin indicated on his/her name tag.  We could really enjoy sharing stories that way.  We had a few meals at the hotel.  All were delicious. I was not expecting gastronomy in Ireland, but was so pleasantly surprised by the quality of the food. All-in-all, our hotel stay was pleasant with just a few small hiccups that did not impact our enjoyment of the hotel.  I do think I would like to try a hotel closer to the center of town on my next stay in Dublin, just to compare experiences.  ",4,2015,07,02
211,"Great hotel, exceptionally friendly and efficient staff","We have just returned from Dublin after a week’s stay on the 22 – 26 June. 

From beginning to end the service and efficiency of the staff was exceptional.  We were not due to check in until the afternoon, but a room was found as soon as we arrived.  This was gratefully received and appreciated we freshened up and started our first day with a fabulous cooked breakfast.  The hostess advised if there was anything we specifically fancied that they would be more than happy to accommodate any requests.  I tested this out on day two, by requesting an omelette and there is no scrimping on portion sizes it kept me full until teatime.

The level of customer service is one of the best I have ever received and I am a global traveller, so well done to Ireland – Dublin and more specifically the The Croke Park Hotel, your staff are a credit to you.  Every member of staff we came upon was courteous, attentive and informative not only about hotel but also about Dublin.

We booked a superior room and it lived up to expectations.  It was very luxurious and made our stay even more enjoyable.

Well done again for making our trip so lovely.",5,2015,07,01
211,Long weekend,"Great hotel,  lovely staff. 
Ate in bar and restaurant and can't fault food or service especially given that we were in the restaurant after a match and staff were extremely busy. 

 Can't wait to go back.

211,Great hotel!,"I stayed at the Croke park hotel in March of 2015. Its on the outer part of Dublin but a short walk to downtown Dublin or a cheap can ride. Upon walking in at 6am! We were greeted by a super friendly staff. Check in was easy and quick which I love. It's a small hotel but spacious on the inside. The rooms were quite big and up to date. The lobby was cozy as was the lounge part which had a TV and fireplace. We had the Irish breakfast one morning and it wasn't the best but definitely wasn't bad. I had a drink at the bar and it was delicious and bartender was friendly. I didn't have one problem staying here and would highly recommend it and stay there again. 

It's also across from there sporting place for and sports fans looking to travel to Dublin.",5,2015,06,30
211,Friendly,"talk about a hotel with security! in order to get the elevator to work you had to use your room key. the room key was your key to electricity, made it more energy efficient, but for me, as an American, i almost forgot my key, several times! It's a learned behavior. I think it is a bit far from all the sights of Dublin, save the Croke Park. The hop on hop off doesn't even come close.",4,2015,06,30
211,"Wonderful, friendly experience","My wife and I thoroughly enjoyed our stay recently.  The hotel is excellent, food is superb and the staff were friendly and helpful.  Room was very clean. Within walking distance of the city centre is a bonus.  
      ",5,2015,06,30
211,"Great Hotel, Great Stay","Myself and my wife have stayed at the hotel on a number of occasions and have always enjoyed the experience, the staff are extremely friendly and helpful. Overall, I would fully recommend the hotel and it is in great location reasonably close to town for overnight theatre nights, dining out etc.",5,2015,06,29
211,Excellent repeat stay!,"We stayed here before for family/ fun visit 3 years ago and again enjoyed nice room, location, quiet environment (no sporting events during our stay).  Staff very helpful, room service great.  We wanted a hotel the night prior to leaving from airport, which let us enjoy their restaurant and room service.   Will stay again, while the location is not in the heart of Dublin, it let us have easy transport to the airport and family nearby addresses.

211,Really truly excellent ,"The hotel and particularly the staff have been excellent. We couldn't have been made more welcome particularly my two young children. When you are on a trip you 
really appreciate people who going the 'extra mile' and the team here do just that☺️ . Yes I could make one or the other comment about improvements  but they are so minor is not worth mentioning",5,2015,06,28
211,Dublin Hotel,All staff very friendly. Hotel spotless. Food excellent. Rooms lovely but beds unusually small for a top class hotel. Very pricey in bar compared to establishments only 100m away. Did not avail of local amenities but many in close proximity of hotel.,4,2015,06,28
211,A Home Away from Home,"We stayed here for 3 nights, the primary reason for our stay was to see The Script at Croke Park for an early 40th Birthday present from my husband.  We travelled from England and on reaching the airport jumped in a Taxi to the hotel (definitely the easiest & quickest method of travel to this hotel).  On reaching the hotel I was shocked at actually how close it is to the stadium, literally right next door!! I'd asked for a quiet room when completing the form that the hotel had e-mailed to me, prior to our stay, and I had mentioned the stay was my early 40th birthday present.  

On checking in we were given hot towels to refresh ourselves, check-in was painless and very quick. We were given our key cards and up we went to, what I hoped would be a quiet room at the end of one of the corridors and away from the lift area.  When we exited the lift on the 2nd floor we were surprised to find that our room (204) was literally to the side and right behind the lifts shafts, this worried us slightly as our bed was right up against this wall but how wrong we were as we didn't hear the lifts at all the whole stay and other than a handful of noisy guests coming and going from the lifts in the morning we literally heard nothing.

On first getting to our room we were really happy with it, nice big bathroom and the bed was huge!! I also had a handwritten card waiting for me that wished me a happy birthday and two small bottles of Prosecco with two champagne flutes (such a lovely touch thank you)!

On the first evening we had dinner in the bar. The menu for the bar and the restaurant are exactly the same which was disappointing as it would have been nice to have a wider choice of food option during the stay but having said that the menu was pretty varied. Drinks are served with a large bowl of nuts which is a nice touch.

Breakfast was fab, although I would have loved to have seen some fried bread (but that's just my choice)!!  Breakfast is served until 10.30am and on the morning after the concert breakfast was served until 11am which was good.

There is a courtesy bus that takes you to O'Connell Street from the hotel and the last bus leaves at 10.30am, we used this bus both days and on our return to the hotel we walked one day (which was not far at all) and took a taxi the next (only because we'd done the Jameson's Whiskey Tour and we were feeling a bit tipsy!!

The hotel does get busy on event days at the stadium so beware of that.  We were told that the afternoon would be busy with concert go-ers and to show our key card when entering the hotel, plus the bar on the 4th floor would be open to residents.  We returned back to the hotel around 4pm that day and we didn't find it that busy at all.  After the concert though was a different story it was heaving and the hotel had laid on an indoor BBQ for all people exiting the stadium so the bar was a mass of Script fans all eating and drinking :o)

I found the bed so comfortable and actually sleep well, which I don't usually do when staying in a hotel. The room was really nice too.  It felt like home and I didn't want to leave when the time came for us to say goodbye.

We would definitely return to this hotel should we come to an event at Croke Park again.

Superb hotel and service - THANK YOU CROKE PARK HOTEL!!!!",5,2015,06,28
211,Top class,"Luxury doesn't come cheap but it was worth it.  We went for the top range rooms and didn't regret it.  From the ease of car parking 'under' the hotel (lots of space, quite secure), swift check-in and friendly staff to an excellent room on the top floor.  The drinks voucher for use in the smart bar area was a nice touch as was access to a computer to print off boarding passes ahead of our flight home.  Staying at the Croke Park means you get reduced admission for the GAA tour of the stadium - a fantastic tour.  

We walked into the city both nights and found it a pleasant 20 minute stroll. 

One very slight gripe - buffet style breakfast means that on occasions small queues build and food items can be left standing for some time.  As I say, a very small gripe.

It's a top class hotel with great staff.",4,2015,06,26
211,"Brilliant, faultless stay!","I have stayed here numerous times and yet again it was fantastic. Went down for the Tyrone game with friends and family. Twin room for my friend and I, two double beds! Massive bathroom, view of the street (ideal on match days).

The hotel itself on match days is electric, people everywhere and a fantastic atmosphere!

Breakfast is always superb! Juices, cereals, breads and fry's - no complaints.

We booked in advance and paid £90 for bed and breakfast.

Only complaint is the use of plastic glasses (match days).

A taxi up to O'Connell street will cost you around 10 euro, you could walk it but its a brave walk.",5,2015,06,26
211,Absolutely faultless,"Stayed here for a conference in May and it was a reminder to always look for a Doyle Hotel as it is a quality mark.
Lovely new hotel, friendly welcoming staff (so unlike the Four Seasons in Carlingford) food was FANTASTIC, I think our meal on Sunday evening was one of the best I have had and I have eaten in a fair few places. Nothing was any trouble. Thoroughly recommended.",5,2015,06,25
211,"Very nice, yet inexpensive hotel withing walk of downtown Dublin","Using our GPS, we had a bit of difficulty finding the Croke Park Hotel, but once we learned it was adjacent to a large sports stadium, it was obvious. The hotel is within a 1 km to 1 mile walk to downtown Dublin. The room was very nice, very clean, and spacious, with modern fixtures and air conditioning. Free parking and excellent, free wifi were available. The bed was VERY soft and comfortable, with extra pillows, amenities, coffee and tea, TV, etc. Our window faced the courtyard, and nice views were seen at the stairwell. Check-in was a bit slow (10-15 minute wait), and our keys did not work until reset, but the staff was very polite and cordial. It was a great stop on our first day in Dublin to recover from jet lag coming from the States. We also recommend the restaurant (see separate review on Side Line Bistro).",5,2015,06,24
211,Brilliant stay!,"Had a brilliant stay at the croke park hotel at the weekend.
Greeted by really friendly staff who couldn't have been more helpful! Room was bright and spacious and the decor lovely and modern we had a double room. The beds are so comfy and I think I had the best sleep of my life! Such a relaxing spot. Wifi connection was great throughout the hotel, we stayed on the 2nd floor and had a fantastic view of croke park. 
The Staff couldn't have been more helpful and accommoding and really made our stay that bit better!
I couldn't fault this hotel; and am so pleased we stayed here! 

The hotel is not situated in the city centre but is only a 15 minute walk to the centre however staff are very helpful and will organise taxis for those who may not be able to walk long distances . 

I thoroughly enjoyed my stay at the croke park hotel and will certainly be recommending it!",5,2015,06,23
211,Great hotel! ,"Stayed at hotel for concert across the road in Croke Park. The best place to stay as we were within ear shot for the sound check, the build up atmosphere, easy access to the concert and the after party. Staff so friendly and welcoming. Room great size and spotless. 
Bar food very good, didn't use Bistro but others very complimentary about it. Free parking in Dublin Hotel unusual but standard here and car park secure and safe. 
Easy walk into town about 10-15min, go via Mountjoy Sq - pretty park and lovely architecture. On main route from airport into city so goo for access. ",5,2015,06,23
211,Business,The hotel is very central to Dublin right opposite the croke stadium. The staff is really good. There is enough open area to dine in summers outside. Very accessible and decently priced. Rooms are good . A little away from the airport but a nice stay is ensured . ,4,2015,06,23
211,Croke Park Hotel,What an incredible hotel!! It was absolutely beautiful and every member of the staff was very friendly and helpful. It was only a ten/fifteen minute walk over to O'Connell Street and lots of sight seeing as well as the Hop on and off bus picks you up straight from the hotel! Would definitely stay here again the next time we have the privilege of going to Ireland ,5,2015,06,23
211,Professional Staff,"Room was large, shower was spacious and was a proper shower not like a lot of hotels that have a shower unit in the bath. Staff were polite and professional in their job. Dinner was good and breakfast was tasty.",4,2015,06,23
211,Great stay in Dublin,"Good welcome, room very confortable (deluxe room), great staff.

+ breakfeast, confortable bed, staff, good wifi connection

- location (not in the city center), no hair dryer in the room...

Great place to stay",5,2015,06,23
211,One of the best,"Me and my husband stayed at the hotel over the weekend. After a long drive from Belfast we were welcomed by a cheerful receptionist, who while checking us in gave us a hot towel to refresh ourselves. (Great touch) 
The room was bright and airy and very clean.
Breakfast the next morning was very enjoyable with lots on offer.
At checkout we were offered a bottle of water each for our long drive home. (Another nice touch) 
Will stay again.",5,2015,06,22
211,Nice hotel near the city,Beautiful hotel. Rooms are clean.  Meals are delicious and plentiful. The lobby is modern and comfortable.  Concierge is helpful.  Right next door to Croke park so good for game attendance.  Close to downtown but not quite easy walking distance.,4,2015,06,22
211,Great place to stay with baby,Our first trip abroad with our 8-month-old in tow was made very enjoyable thanks to the Croke Park Hotel. Special requests were no problem (Baby T required a nap before our room was available and a conference room was availed to him immediately). The hotel room (double + twin bed) was spacious enough for our travel crib and the bathroom had a shower and separate bathtub. The breakfast was wonderful and we enjoyed quite a few dinners at the hotel restaurant as well. The staff were fantastic and made Baby T feel very welcome. We found the short cab ride to St. Stephens Green for our daily stroller walk very manageable.  Would definitely stay here again!,5,2015,06,22
211,We certainly will  return here,"This is a really great hotel from the moment we walked through the door and were welcomed at reception to the time we left nothing can be faulted. Great sleep quality excellent breakfast and a hotel which is easily walkable to the city if you like a walk but if not transport is easy. We were there for Blooms Day and it was an ideal base and a good 
price.",5,2015,06,22
211,fabulous hotel,we were on the 4th floor with access to the executive lounge.  as we were going to a concert & only staying 1 night we didn't get to avail of the complimentary beverages (non alcoholic) & snacks available during the day but had breakfast there in the morning.  it was continental but was sufficient.  room was very comfortable & clean.  all staff that we met were exceptionally polite & mannerly.  may cost a bit more than what we usually pay for an overnight stay but it was well worth it,5,2015,06,22
211,A great weekend stay!,"A bit out of town, but certainly within walking distance.  Excellent hotel--I echo all the previous sentiments. The staff could not have been more friendly or helpful.  We arrived from the US on an early flight at 6 AM--and they allowed us to check right into our room, which was amazing.  We were also offered lovely warm wash clothes at check-in! I had not realized at booking that a free breakfast was included (wonderful!) PLUS--our room included entry to the Executive Lounge, where we could get free juice, bottled water, food etc, which was very nice. There were no events going on at the nearby Stadium during our stay, so it was very nice and quiet. ",5,2015,06,21
211,Good business hotel,"I had this hotel booked for me by our agency for our recent event in Dublin, the website looked good so I was cautiously optimistic.  The hotel, as the name suggests, is located right next to the Croke Park Gaelic Football Stadium, so if you're attending a match there or a concert (or even wish to do the tour), this hotel is ideally located.

As a business hotel it's really nice, the rooms are very comfortable and come with an iron and ironing board which was usable (unlike some hotels I've stayed in).  I had a minor quibble in the room regarding the sink plug, but this was quickly fixed.  The bar was good, the staff were really friendly and helpful, so no complaints there :)

The only downside I personally found was that it's not particularly near to any public transport.  For tourists, the hotel will arrange a bus so there is cover there, but otherwise you either have to walk or take a cab.  The centre of Dublin is a €10 EUR ride away, however on the advise of my brother and a couple of taxi drivers I would not recommend walking into town as some of the surrounding areas are not great.

On the whole, a good experience and the hotel has a lot to recommend.  If you're driving it's great as there is parking, but if you're relying on public transport, bear my comments in mind.",4,2015,06,21
211,Hotels like this are a joy to find!,"Loved this hotel. Reasonably priced (very competive, particularly for a big city centre): so spacious that it felt as though we had rented a suite, and we even had a big balcony; good parking which was free; can't fault the staff, who were courteous and extremely helpful; and a breakfast to die for, virtually haute cuisine. If we are back in Dublin, we will be booking this hotel.",5,2015,06,21
211,They know how to look after  you,"This a great gem of a hotel. Service is great, breakfast is great quality, and the staff are very attentive, a special mention to Gerry the Maintenance Manager for helping with my car issues. Clean and fresh hotel, fully recommend.",5,2015,06,21
211,perfect pick,"We only stayed one night - but this was just the type of place we were looking for.  We had just gotten in from our overseas flight - they let us check in very early, which was great.  Were able to change and head out to see the city.  We had no problems walking to the hop on hop off bus stop so we could leave our car parked in their covered parking.   Everyone was friendly, the place was clean and just what we were looking for to start our trip.",4,2015,06,20
211,beautiful  hotel,"We stayed at the Westin for a weekend and chose it for its location and because we wanted something special. This hotel is wonderful since you walk in the door, breathes tranquility, they looked after us very kindly, as might be expected in a 5 *. The fantastic breakfast buffet and everything to choose from. The room due to a side street and was tranquilisima. All very clean with very many details. If you want something special and you can afford to occasionally go for it",5,2015,06,20
211,Great hotel if...,"We only stayed here two nights but loved the location, staff, nice room, comfy beds, and covered free parking.  We did not sample the breakfast, so I cannot speak to that.  I could see this location being a problem though if there was an actual event going on in Croke Park.  I wanted a location that was quiet and slightly outside the main Dublin area, and this certainly did the trick since there were no events planned during our stay.  It is about a 10 minute walk to the city center, and a pleasant one at that.  Modern hotel, very helpful staff, and I would definitely stay here again!",4,2015,06,19
211,4 star hotel that feels like 3 stars,"I still cannot explain to myself how come this place ranks #3 on Tripadvisor?!?!?!?!

I am not one of those reviewers who complains about small details or little faults that can happen anywhere and I am generally always giving good grades to businesses because I do understand it is not an easy task to run a hotel HOWEVER, when you charge almost 700 euros for 3 nights and you offer a terrible service....??!?!?!?!?

- we had booked a room that was labelled as ""family room"" with beds that were supposed to be accommodating 2 adults and 2 kids, however it would only be true if you are very thin (anorexic side) and you are sleeping tightly hugged.
- the room is very old looking and the towels were not always clean, with some visible stains on them.
-calling reception can be a real challenge, nobody picks up.
-breakfast is limited and everything smells like pork fat
- except for the yoghurt and some oranges, no healthy options to eat
- most of the staff is just plain indifferent. The exception rule applies only to Eva and the lovely lady from breakfast reception.
-the hotel is close to the airport, so don't book it unless u need to spend the night before another flight or you are there for the conference centre located nearby. 

Bottom line, stay away from this place.

211,Helpful Friendly Place,"This was our first stop in Ireland. In spite of jet lag, we were immediately impressed with the kind, helpful attitude of the desk staff. They provided us with maps and directions for what we wanted to see. The room was lovely and the restaurant exceptional.",5,2015,06,18
211,Pristine,"I don't know how long this hotel has been open, but I seldom stay in a place that I can call pristine.  The room was flawless, clean, comfortable and equipped beyond every need.  I slept great despite facing a long flight the next morning.  The check in was friendly and efficient.  The same can be said for the bar and restaurant service.  We enjoyed the food and beverage selection.  The drive to the airport was short and easy.  I wouldn't hesitate to stay here again.",5,2015,06,18
211,Fantastic Visit,"Had an excellent stay in the Croke park hotel. Room was excellent, had breakfast delivered to room for a small charge.  Staff were excellent , very welcoming and curterous. Orla Mahon in particular was a  great help .",5,2015,06,18
211,Luxurious ,I arrived very late in the evening and felt very welcomed.  The room was wonderful and even had herbal tea in the room.  The food was incredible and the staff were always friendly and helpful.  There is a gym on site and the staff will open it at any time of the day for you.  Great view of Croke Park and quite convenient to see the sights of Dublin.,5,2015,06,17
211,TOP HOTEL,"Cant fault this hotel in any way,would certainly stay there again.location very good,Didn,t use any hotel facilities as is was a short stay,but would stay longer  and use them next time i visit Dublin,     
      
      
      ",5,2015,06,17
211,A really good place to stay in Dublin,"We were impressed right from the outset when we were cheerfully welcomed and efficiently checked in. The on site car park is really handy and the proximity to Dublin town centre is great ( 15 mins stroll) the breakfast was one of the best we have ever experienced . Comfortable room , quiet etc
      ",5,2015,06,17
211,Very Nice Property,"Overall, our experience at this property was perfect. The room was clean, and nicely appointed. Not a single problem. It's not in Central Dublin, but close enough to get there via public transportation. I highly recommend this property.",5,2015,06,16
211,"Hotel is great, restaurant not so much","The Crooke Park Hotel is a very nice, modern hotel.  The rooms are somewhat large and very clean and modern furniture.  See pics of our room.  There is free Wi-fi which was rather fast and reliable.  Well equipped room with everything you would expect.  We were part of a tour group and we all had dinner in the restaurant - the meal was horrendous - but that will be a separate restaurant review.  Suffice to say that it was by far, the worst meal in the entire tour.  Not just the food, but the staff were not helpful and tried to ignore us.  We paid approximately 138BP or 190E or 169US",3,2015,06,15
211,Very comfortable and good service,"Croke Park Hotel was extremely comfortable and the staff were very welcoming and friendly. The bed was very comfortable and I didn't want to get out of it the next morning ! It was a short walk into Dublin from there. The staff were very helpful with 
directions and suggestions.  We ate in the restaurant both nights we were there and found the food very good - better than the usual standard hotel fare.  The fish and chips were excellent and I couldn't eat it all! Would stay there again. Plenty of milk, tea and coffee in the room - although a warning - don't EVEN move anything in the 
in-room bar fridge - you'll get charged ! Although to be fair when we said that all we had used the fridge for was to keep a bottle of water in they removed the charges.
The room was at the back and we overlooked the courtyard and across to the other rooms, but it was light and airy and very comfortable.",5,2015,06,15
211,Just Pure Excellence,Upon arrival the grounds and building were of great attraction and comfort. Entrance into reception was an instance relaxation spot with gentle music and tranquil surroundings. The room itself was just fantastic cooled and aired with luxury comfort in the bed and 100% bliss. Truly enjoyable. An experience that will be tried again.,5,2015,06,15
211,Croke Park Hotel,"Best breakfast in all of the hotel breakfasts  that we had in Ireland.
      
assistance with planned activities     
      
assistance with taxi

found hat that was left behind at checkout

close to bus line

able to walk to downtown- wouldn't suggest in the rain- we got soaked and ended up going the rest of the way by taxi

211,Slightly disappointed,"Had read some lovely reviews on The Croke Park and booked to spend Thursday till Sunday for a weekend break with the other half.
For what we'd paid I was a little disappointed with the room.  Everything just seemed a little basic.  We were told our view was over the courtyard, if by courtyard they meant an old car park and the view of the Croke's skip facilities well then they were right.
1st visit to the loo seen the handle on the inside of the door come off in my partners hand and the towel rail under the sink fall off when she dried her hands.  I was getting the sense that things were on the downward direction.  
Minibar was inaccessible unless you asked at reception for it to be unlocked, handy to know before getting to your room.  After the hairdryer refused to work it was time to have a word with reception.
I explained what the issues were but unfortunately they were full till the next day around lunchtime but agreed to move us.  The next day we set off on the traditional Dublin bus tour and left our cases with reception who said they'd have them put in our new room for us returning.  After a superb tour we returned that night and asked at reception for our new keys.  After finding that the new keys weren't working we returned to reception to get 2 that did.  So we eventually get to our room and had a good look round.  Pretty much the same room but with everything working as it should.  No cases though?? We tottled back to reception and they found our cases and offered to have them taken up to our room, we decided the best bet was to take them ourselves.
On the whole, the staff were very friendly and helpful, the room eventually was fine although a little basic.  Gym facilities were good without issue. 
We paid 14 euro each × 2 for breakfast for 2 mornings and the breakfast was lovely and again the staff couldn't have been nicer.  
On the night of our arrival we thought we'd eat at the hotel.  Was a little deserted and had a very corporate business stopover kind of feel to the place, nothing wow or worth a mention including the food.
Ate out the other two nights and had amazing food.

So all in all if you want luxury and the wow factor, this isn't it.  Definitely wouldn't return.  Maybe my own fault for not researching it enough but I've had better rooms & food at the premier inn.
Again the staff though were 10/10 so a big thumbs up to them!! ",3,2015,06,14
211,"croke park hotel dublin,i.e.","Clean rooms, remarkably quiet, excellent wholesome free breakfast to start the day, friendly and courteous staff.   This hotel compares favorably to some of the best hotels in New York City at one-half the price (at least in USD terms at roughly 110-112 USD per Euro.  Overall, the experience was simply beyond reproach---recommend highly!",5,2015,06,11

211,Loved This Hotel,"We loved the Croke Park Hotel. On booking we requested a quiet room and were given the very last room on the landing, Great, we never heard a sound. The room was beautiful, particularly the bathroom with a bath and a shower cubicle. Really nice shampoo, shower gel, body lotion etc. My wife was impressed at the quality. The location is an 8/9 euro taxi ride from the centre, however the price we got for B&B  (£85 per night) was so good we could afford to budget for the taxis to the centre and back. The taxis in Dublin are so easy to get, you only wait a minute for one.

The staff were really helpful & friendly. And the breakfast atmosphere was really calm and very good quality food. The staff offer specially cooked breakfasts to your order. However the buffet suited me nicely.

When I return I'll stay at the Croke Park again. I loved it.",4,2015,06,10
211,Lovely interlude,"We stayed one night on the way to our cottage in the west after visiting an elderly aunt in Dublin. By chance we had stayed at your sister hotel in London the week before as part of our daughter's 30th birthday celebrations. Both visits were extremely pleasant and very relaxing. The breakfast in both hotels was excellent but the Croke Park excelled itself with the choice provided, especially the honey still in the honeycomb. Our son sometimes stays at the hotel in London (the Kensington) when he is there on business and recommended the hotels to us. He accompanied us on both occasions.",5,2015,06,10
211,Great modern hotel in Dublin,"The Croke Park Hotel is a very nice, modern hotel in Dublin located right across the street from Croke Park, the largest football stadium in Ireland. The rooms are spacious and clean. The staff was very attentive and knowledgeable, in particular Ian at the front desk. There is free WiFi which is fast. The room rate included breakfast which was a full on breakfast buffet and was very good. The hotel is about a 20 minute walk from the city center but the walk is actually enjoyable and let me absorb some of the vibe of the city away from the tourist areas. The hotel provides free parking which is rare these days. I would stay here again.",5,2015,06,09
211,"Excellent service, decent proximity to downtown","The Good:  Room was very big (specially for European standards).   Room was very clean and the bathroom had both a tub and separate shower (nice touch).  Free wifi in room and throughout hotel.   Free parking downstairs.  Adjacent bar, restaurant, and even a fitness center.  Staff was overall friendly (standard for Ireland, from what I have now discovered).  The hot towels upon arrival were a nice touch.  The helpful tips by the concierge (see below under ok).

The Ok:  Once again this is another place in Dublin that I can not give any real bad marks to.   Right across from the famous Croke Park (Stadium (3rd largest in Europe), so you might get a large crow within the vicinity of the hotel during soccer, or Hurling (google this) matches... but no big deal.   The price at the bar and restaurant are a bit too steep for me....luckily the concierge pointed me to a local place (about a 5 min walk for a good Irish breakfast (yummy) for 1/4 of the price....

Note:  For those who stated you needed a cab to get to the downtown area (i.e. - Temple bar area..not true...it is a 1 mile walk... we did it in about 20 minutes...).....even if you want to cab it it was only 11 euros... the driver was friendly so I gave him a 20 Euro bill and told him to get two pints... hey Irish people are friendly so I figure I must be the same.",4,2015,06,08
211,great deal,"Had bed and breakfast here for £100. It's a very good hotel with great rooms, bar is very nice too. Breakfast was great with plenty of choice. It's not in the best of locations but you can walk into town easily enough and it doesn't take too long.",5,2015,06,08
211,Dublin weekend,"Stayed at the Croke Park Hotel for the weekend and I have to say it was superb. The staff were polite and friendly, happy to help with any queries or problems. The room was clean and the bed was very comfortable, the bar and restaurant were top notch. If you are going to Dublin for whatever reason I highly recommend this hotel. ",5,2015,06,08
211,"Beautiful Place, Be careful of hidden charges.","The pros - This was a beautiful hotel. Very well kept and clean. The beds were very comfortable and the breakfast buffet was very hearty and tasted good. The hotel staff was very eager to help with everything including scheduling a cab for the next morning. They were fantastic.

On of the cons of this hotel is the location (which is a plus if you are going to something at the Croke Park which is conveniently located across the street) if you are walking from the center of Dublin it can be a scary part of town. In daylight it is fine, but at night it can be a little scary. If you are in center Dubin, take a cab back to the hotel after dark. Another con was the phone charge, at all of the other hotels I stayed in Ireland calling out of the hotel was free, but at Croke Park Hotel it was $1.00 charge to call to the calling card company and they charged you a fee every minute you are talking even with using a calling card. It was cheaper to call international through the hotel.

Even with those cons, this hotel was great because of the staff and nicely kept hotel rooms.",4,2015,06,05
211,Good little hotel and perfect for Croke Park,"I booked this hotel as I had an early start at Croke Park. Location wise, it is a little way out from the center of Dublin, but its easy enough in a cab.

All the staff were very friendly and the guest areas were very welcoming. Loved my room. Nice and spacious, clean and huge bathroom.

A very good selection for breakfast and the concierge team went out of their way to help.

I was just a little disappointed I was only saying one night, could happily of stayed longer.",5,2015,06,05
211,Excellent!!!,"We have stayed at the hotel for 2 nights during our trip to Dublin and loved it.

The Hotel is situated 6 min. walk from the Bus station that connects with City Center in one direction and with Dublin Airport in another direction.

The transfer from Dublin Airport took us 30 min. We went by Bus Line 16 that stops at the Airport and saved some money. The cost of the whole journey for 2 people was around 6 Euros. In order to save even more money, there is a possibility to purchase a Leap Card (5 Euros) and to put a deposit on it. The journey in that case is even cheaper and the card could be used for as many people as desired.

We made the transfer back to the Airport by taxi in early morning at 4.30 AM. The cost was EUR 25, but night tariffs should be taken into consideration.

The rooms in the hotel are very spacious as well as the bath room is. The bed is very comfortable. I would like to mention that our room has been upgraded from 2 single beds to 1 king bed free of charge! Very pleasant!!!

There was free WiFi in the rooms. The speed was excellent as we used it for video chatting in Skype without any problems.

The only thing to be mentioned is the lack of socket adapters for European standards. But, the problem has been solved with the help of Reception.

Free of charge safe box in the room, hair dryer, daily cleaning, kettle, tea, instant coffee, even hot chocolate should be mentioned as well.

The Croke Park Hotel is member of Global Hotel Alliance and you get a free registration at check-in. The membership lets you enjoy benefits when staying at many other hotels in the world as mentioned in their leaflets.

I would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone. One of the best value for money!",5,2015,06,05
211,5 Star Customer Service,"Superb customer service at this hotel. Stayed there 31st May - 2nd June 2015 and they could not have been more helpful with sorting issues, providing advice, making suggestions and welcoming us. Ian on the front desk was particularly excellent. Happy to recommend him for a customer service award if hotel gets in touch. 
If you're getting a hotel to / from the city centre the taxi drivers will take you whatever route they need to to make the fare 10euro+. Not something the hotel can do much about but just be aware, 
Really is worth staying for the quality of customer care and makes for a very relaxing and enjoyable experience. ",5,2015,06,04
211,Just Alright,"There are lots of good things about the Croke Park Hotel. It is affordable. It is family friendly. The concierge was, in my experience, very helpful. Unfortunately, it's quite removed from the city center. The service was uneven--the front desk gave me the wrong information regarding laundry, the restaurant staff forgot my table. Overall, alright.",3,2015,06,03
211,Very corporate/business feel,"Clean rooms with wifi. Hotel is on the tour bus route for quick and easy pick up in the mornings to see Dublin.  Convenient location.  
Staff was not very friendly during the check in process or when we went through public areas.  Made for a very stale and corporate feel- great for business travelers!  Not so much for families on vacation looking for friendly faces and conversation.  ",3,2015,06,03
211,Honeymoon was perfect! ,"Really great stay at this top notch hotel!  Staff went above and beyond to help us celebrate our honeymoon with lovely treats.  

Semi removed from the central festivities, but with in walking distance to the hop on hop off bus which was all we needed.   

Great bar tenders if you wanted to stay in and couldn't be closer to the GAA.  

Would absolutely stay here again. ",5,2015,06,03
211,Excellent Hotel in Dublin,"My wife and I stayed in The Croke Park Hotel for 2 nights over the June bank holiday weekend for our wedding anniversary. On arrival the hotel staff gave us an upgrade to a  large room with a balcony. The Hotel also had another surprise of chilled prescesso waiting in our room for us. This really added to our experience and stay. The bedroom was spotless, bright and spacious. The bed was huge and really comfortable. The bathroom had a separate large shower and a bath. The bathroom was huge and had brilliant lighting.
We ate the first evening in the bar, the food was excellent. It was great value and the portions were big. We really enjoyed our meal and a few drinks. The bar staff were friendly, efficient and professional. 
The breakfast was a buffet in the restaurant. The display and selection of food was excellent as was the taste! We ate in the restaurant on the second evening. Again, the food was superb. The restaurant staff were very efficient, helpful and professional. The hotel has free fast speed broadband throughout all areas in the hotel.
Overall, our stay was very enjoyable, very relaxing and we felt very welcome and well looked after. All the staff were very welcoming and very friendly and professional. THANK YOU to all staff in the Croke Park Hotel. We will definitely be back! We would highly recommend the Croke Park Hotel for couples, families, business etc..it caters for all.",5,2015,06,03
211,Good place to stay,"Stayed a couple of weekends ago, great hotel in a good location between the airport and the centre.  Well equipped room with everything you would expect.  Excellent service throughout, our package included the hop-on hop-off tour and a free cocktail! We ate in the restaurant in the evening and the meal was lovely, not the cheapest, but very good.  Would stay again.",5,2015,06,03
211,Croke Park,"Fabulous hotel and very reasonable price. Not situated in the prettiest part of town but an easy 10 minute walk in. Staff were all very helpful. The breakfast was very good. Free parking which is rare in central Dublin.
      
      
      ",4,2015,06,03
211,Great place to stay on outskirt of Dublin,We recently had a two night stay with friends in Dublin. The welcome at the hotel was friendly and all staff throughout our stay were great. The rooms were spacious and quiet which guaranteed a good night's sleep. The mattress was particularly comfortable.  Highly recommended and we would stay here again.,5,2015,06,01
211,RENOVATED HOTEL,"Stayed for 8 nights 

Dublin is great city to visit as for adults so for kids - there are so many museums, galleries, entertainments, festivals, parks and sightseeing there … 

The city is divided by Liffey river to SOUTH part (I would call it as Oldy Town ;) where most sightseeing things and stores, pubs etc located, and NORTH part where the tourists place located mostly along the river's quay.  

The Crock Part hotel located in a North part, about 20 min walk to the city's center. 
I didn't mind walking that route every day - got city's real feelings and some physical training too ;))

ON THE LIGHT SIDE:

THE HOTEL:
- Very good pre-visit and during stay communication - the hotel immediately and very friendly responds to your emails and requests;
- There is a Concierge service which is very convenient, so I got there info about Dublin, tours booking, advices etc.
There are RED HopOn-HopOff bus stop (Blue line) and GREEN HopOn-HopOff bus stop just across the hotel.

STAFF - Well trained and always polite. 
I've saw negative reviews about hotel's bar people, visited the bar myself and didn't find any problems there - bartenders and waiters were kind and attentive, the bar's ambience with a real fireplace was very relaxing and comfy. The meals and drinks were good enough.

A ROOM: has a good size, nice bed and white, fresh linen. There are a kettle with a great set of the tea, coffee, cacao, sugars and cookies.

ROOM CLEANING: No complains at all, everything cleaned properly.

BATHROOM: Spacy, nice quality towels.

PRICE/QUALITY: What I've paid (Eur per night) seems to be a reasonable price comparing with other hotels and even AirBnB.

TRANSPORTATION TO/FROM HOTEL: I had late night arrival, the taxi from airport was quick (less than 10 mins) and inexpensive (18 Eur), and the same for my trip back to airport.

ON THE DARK SIDE:

ROOM: 
- I've got a connected room, despite provided special note that I'm a light sleeper; thin walls don't block sounds from other rooms too. The entrance door also hasn't soundproof and door-stoppers, so I heard the people talks in the corridor and door closing bangs.
-There is a working desk, but there are no receptacles (sockets) for the PC, chargers etc., so in order to connect my stuff I had to disconnect the kettle.
- There was no bag stand, so my bag stood right on the floor;
- There was no coat's hook, so I had to put my coat somewhere.

INTERNET:
- UNSTABLE Wi-Fi internet, when working it has good enough at 6 ms ping; download 15 Mbps, upload 9.5 Mbps, unfortunately that instability was troubling  Skyping, video streaming etc.
I've informed the hotel about internet connection problem and ask for the help, the reaction was quite surprising - ""We've checked the internet and have found no problems""…

BATHROOM:
- There are no electrical receptacles in the bathroom, so I couldn't use my electrical toothbrush. Asked the management, no solution has been found.
- There was no bathtub, the shower only;
- Very low water's pressure from sink's tap;
- No hooks for the ropes in bathroom. There are some tiny ones which can't be used for that purpose.
- There was a strange bathroom's rules when my stuff consistently has been moved from shower to sink's shelf.

CONCLUSION: Renovated hotel with friendly staff, regrettably experiencing old infrastructure problems. 

MY RATING (from 1 to 5):

Frontdesk - 5
Location - 3
Room - 2
Bathroom - 3
Room Cleaning -5
Internet - 3
Price/quality - 4

Dublin is great city to visit as for adults so for kids - there are so many museums, galleries, entertainments, festivals, parks and sightseeing there… 

I've took City Sightseeing and Wicklow Mountain tours and visited I believe most popular sightseeing under its routes. 

There is some special thing there too, as the church where St. Valentine's relics and its Shrine are. 

Don't believe the information published on the web, many of that info is outdated, so double check it when arrive.

A Lonely Planet said about an Irish pub: 
""It’s a unique institution: a theatre and a cosy room, a centre stage and a hideaway, a debating chamber and a place for silent contemplation. It’s whatever you want it to be, and that’s the secret of the great Irish pub"" 
I've stop by at the most famous (Temple Bar), most oldest (The Brazen Head), most tallest (Johnnie Fox's), a pub visited by Bill Clinton and Julia Roberts (Ryan's Bar) and other.

Found very convenient local Horizon card used for obtain a TaxFree Refund – take it from the vendor, obtain a refund for any purchase over EUR 100 and placed on this card, and when departing at the airport machine move all refund to your credit card. Easy and comfy. I like such service for the tourists.",4,2015,06,01
211,Staff could do with been more customer focused .,"Beautiful hotel , very clean and modern  ,, only negatives would be
1. Bar service is so so slow,, staff walking around looking busy but was left ages waiting for my order to be taken and drinks that I ordered never made it to me but was still charge!!! Food in bar is way over priced . €15 for a burger that was greasy and lacked any kind of presentation .

2,location is a good 25 min walk from city centre which is a pain, solely for this reason I would stay in a more city centre hotel next time as all the taxi rides add up.

3. The conceirge was not very helpful ( both of them that I delt with on different occasions ) left waiting with no follow up by one guy after he told me he would check out what I asked him and get back to me, he never did ! and the other guy was giving me direction as if I was a local and should of know where I was going when I explained that I didn't know Dublin!ended up getting a taxi at my own discredits  as I couldn't make heads or tails of directions he gave me. Just no interest and to me this is a complete lack of customer service .",3,2015,05,30
211,Fantastic hotel,What a great hotel fabulous rooms and staff really made us feel welcome the food in the  restaurant  was amazing and the cocktails afterwards were even better can't recommend this hotel enough you won't be disappointed,5,2015,05,30
211,Luxurious,"The Croke is directly across the street from the infamous Croke Stadium.  It is about a thirty minute walk (5 Euro cab ride) to Grafton Street for shopping or The Temple Area for nightlife.  Very convenient to the airport.  The hotel is very luxurious and so it is worth the high price.  The beds are large and very comfortable.  The pillows were just about the best pillows on our entire trip in Ireland.  They upgraded us to a suite free of charge, which provided a large spacious seating area in addition to the bedroom.",5,2015,05,29
211,Perfect for Business,"I cannot fault The Croke Park hotel, there rooms are spacious and spotless. I ate in the bar during my stay they have a nice variety of options to choose from I had the fish and chips which was very tasty. 

All the staff who I encountered were extremely friendly. The complimentary underground car parking is a major plus. Unfortunately I didn't have time for breakfast the next morning. I will return be it for business or leisure.",5,2015,05,29
211,Lovely Hotel,"We stayed here for 2 nights and were very happy with the room and the service, the breakfast was first class and although we did not eat in the restaurant we had lunch in the bar which was lovely. I would recommend this any one who wants a quiet hotel just outside the city centre.",5,2015,05,28
211,SImply the Best,"When we landed in Ireland this was the first hotel we hit, and became the standard by which all the others were judged. We were greeted at the desk with warm towels to remove the road dust, and from there it only got better.",5,2015,05,28
211,Best night's sleep ever!,"Unfortunately only had one night in the hotel, would love to have had a reason to stay longer! Lovely hotel, extremely clean and staff sooooo friendly. The bed was so comfortable Breakfast was delicious! Will be back!",5,2015,05,28
211,Nice hotel but a pain to find!,We stayed for 2 nights.  If you don't get a taxi - this is a bit of a pain to find and quite a walk from the hearest bus stop. The staff were pleasant. You need to use your room key to use the lift so beware! Quite a nice hotel but beds were quite small so be careful if you are tall! The area around the hotel is a bit grotty but you are within walking distance of O'Connell Street etc. Not a bad hotel overall!,3,2015,05,27
211,Great hotel experience,"The hotel is easily accessible from the Airport Shuttle Bus (10 minute walk to nearest stop) and 15 minute walk into the heart of Dublin, O'Connells Street. iPod docking station in the room for music and charging. The White Company toiletries. Spacious room. Internet access throughout the hotel. The only negative points are that the outdoor area for the bar is not as pleasant as the part next to the Sideline Bistrot and the breakfast room felt a bit cramped. Other than that great breakfast and bar!",5,2015,05,27
211,Comfort and Great Dining,"I have stayed at the Croke Park in Dublin on every visit there. It has a great atmosphere, and some reasonable Pubs just a few blocks away from the famous Stadium. Eating in the Restaurant there was delightful and I really enjoyed the food. Definitely a place for the traveler who wishes to spend his money on the sights and famous dwellings in Dublin, rather than on a startling hotel.
I found the place extremely clean, and met many a friend for lunch or supper in the Hotel's Restaurant. Try it...you will enjoy the experience!!",4,2015,05,26
211,Consistently and reliably good and pleasant service,"I popped into this very usefully located hotel quite regularly for quick meetings over a coffee, for a coffee shop/bar breakfast for me, or occassionally to just chill between city office meeetings. Its perfect. The staff are somehow invariably bright, helpful, on the ball, and on your side. It's remarkable - and I'm remarking - and saying a very sincere thank you. A great and accomodating place to drop in, and be treated like a valuable member of the human race.",5,2015,05,26
211,Excellent stay!,"I only have good words for this hotel having stayed for several nights. Upon arrival you're instantly welcomed by the staff on the front desk who can't do enough to help you.

We stayed on the fourth floor which gives you access to the executive suite where you can have continental breakfast, relax and unwind with free tea, coffee and news papers. The suite overlooks Croke Park Stadium and is comfortable to sit in.

The room was spacious and comfortable with views onto the street from the side of the hotel. The room had everything you would expect and more. Tea/Coffee, wifi, ethernet and so on.

On several occasions we had eaten at the hotel bar and restaurant. I can not fault the food it was that good!

Depending on how you look at eat, the hotel is away from the hustle and bustle of the city centre and Temple Bar. However, there is a bus service on the mornings and afternoons which you can purchase tickets for. I would recommend this. Any other time its a taxi which is around €20.

The hotel appears to be a choice for American Airlines and Lufthansa. There were a lot of cabin crew and pilots at the hotel. You know its a good choice then!",5,2015,05,26
211,Excellent hotel,"We booked this hotel as part of a package deal with flights to Dublin and it was amazing value for money. The staff were friendly and helpful and the room was wonderfully comfortable.

It was a little bit of a walk from the citycentre but definitely worth it.",5,2015,05,25
211,Amazing hotel and staff.,"We stayed here for two nights on the city break package. The rooms were spacious and spotlessly clean. Bathroom was a good size also. 
The staff were all really friendly but I must mention Orla the duty manager who was working on our first day as she was absolutely fantastic. I have never really received such exceptional service before. Even after her shift had finished she was still working away and was just as polite and went out of her way to help. 

Now onto the food which was extremely good for a hotel restaurant. We had the crab avocado cocktail to start which was tasty, light and fresh. I had lamb for mains and my husband had the burger which was both very good and for dessert we had the chocolate trio and crumble which were both delicious.

We had access to the executive lounge which was a relaxing experience and a good selection of drinks available.

The hotel is about a 15 minute walk to the city centre but if you don't mind walking it is a perfect option. I can honestly say it is one of the best hotels I have stayed in and definitely made our break to Dublin a memorable one.",5,2015,05,25
211,Can't think of a bad review even if I tried.,"So myself and 4 other friends stayed at this hotel for May bank holiday weekend, we booked this hotel from the beginning because the price was so good but to be honest we weren't expecting it to be as top notch as what it was. The staff couldn't have been anymore helpful, everything we needed they would jump to our call and it was dealt with within 5 minutes, literally. None of us had been to Dublin before and the staff were more than happy to guide us and make recommendations. On the first night we had arrived we thought we would have a meal in the restaurant downstairs and we are so glad we did, the Thai Curry was absolutely amazing and the waitresses were so helpful, well mannered and polite and the prices were so reasonable. The rooms were clean and we had our towels and bed linens changed both nights without any issues. The images on the website for this hotel don't even give it justice, it was one of the best hotels we have ever stayed at. My friends and I still have so much to see in Dublin so we will definitely be visiting again and without a doubt will be making a reservation at this hotel again. After reading this review I hope you decide to make a reservation because you won't be disappointed, trust me.",5,2015,05,25
211,Excellent hotel !,"Everything was great : Room , Service , Concierge , Check-in and Check-out. The restaurant has great food and wonderful service . Dublin is a small city and hence distances are not a problem. By cab its only 5 minutes from City centre and 15-20 mins to the airport. Spacious and modern room and very good value for money.",5,2015,05,25
211,great hotel,"We had a great stay at the Croke Park Hotel. The taxi from the Dublin airport to the hotel was only about 20 euro, and even though we arrived early in the morning, they had a room open for us. The staff was always very friendly and helpful, and they even gave us a small bottle of prosecco to honor our honeymoon.

It is literally right across from Croke Park and a nice walk to City Centre. The interior of the hotel is pretty sleek, and the room itself was also quite nice and clean. The bathroom was spacious even though I think it was just a regular room. 

We also enjoyed the Irish breakfast buffet. The gym was pretty modern with lots of equipment and energetic dance music. The attached restaurant seemed pretty busy. All in all, we were quite satisfied.",5,2015,05,24
211,Would definitely stay again,"Difficult to fault this.spotless rooms ,big comfy bed,lovely bathroom ,good facilities,car park under the hotel, staff friendly and efficient,concierge falling over himself to help me etc etc. would definitely stay again.",5,2015,05,24
211,Far exceeded our expectations,From the moment we arrived our expectations were exceeded from the friendly staff to the well appointed room. We were offered a free upgrade to the executive level but would happilly spent extra for the added ammenities. The Croke Park Hotel is one of the best values for the money we have experienced in our extensive travels. ,5,2015,05,24
211,Great hotel,"The Croke Park Hotel staff is great.  From making a reservation with Paige to checking in on our arrival, the staff is excellent. The Concierge was very helpful with tickets, travel ideas and helping us find our way around the city.  House keeping and restaurant staff rounded out a great stay.",5,2015,05,24
211,perfect,"The hotel was perfect, room was clean, there were everything that might be necessary. The stuff were very kind and friendly. It might be the best choice if we consider the price and location. It was 20-25 minutes walking distance from the tample bar area.
      ",5,2015,05,24
211,Does what it says on the tin,"Nice hotel, lovely bar and incredibly friendly staff.   I stayed for a business conference and was treated withe every kindness by the team at the hotel.    

Very convenient to the park.  Just be careful with morning traffic jams and getting to destination on time",4,2015,05,23
211,Excellent base in Dublin,"Needed a base in Dublin for business & for visiting friends from Germany. The hotel was very suitable for both.
Large, clean modern room, large bathroom, very comfortable bed.
Friendly, helpful staff.
Large breakfast buffet was good, but not great. Could have used a bit more variety & the scrambled eggs were, frankly, poor.
Easy walking or bus distance from city centre & most attractions.",4,2015,05,23
211,"Great stay, great staff","Lovely hotel, large rooms and corridors. 
Receptionist at check in and check out were very friendly as well as the concierge. 
Loved the White Company products in this bathroom.
Right accross the stadium it is easy to find and not far from the centre.
",5,2015,05,22
211,Upmarket,"Lovely modern hotel, nice big room and bathroom, everything with deep plush carpet, comfortable bed.  Free parking underground (they give you a validated ticket). No free wifi unless you sign up to some loyalty thing.

We accidentally got an Executive Room which meant we got free continental breakfast which was great.  We had a drink in the friendly downstairs bar both nights.

The hotel was very quiet except for doors banging - they seem to be impossible to close quietly.

We were able to walk into town (about 20 mins?) and there are a handful of restaurants nearby.

Main problems: front desk biblically slow (but then very helpful when you finally get to the front of the line), and lots of people having trouble with their keycards.  We didn't personally have any trouble but while we were waiting to check in two separate irate customers came to the desk.  

Would definitely stay here again, if I could afford it!",5,2015,05,21
211,Modern and comfortable,"Modern hotel located just across the street from Croke Park Stadium. Rooms were spacious and comfortable. Staff were excellent and the concierge was very helpful. While the hotel is away a bit further away from downtown, it's still easy to get pretty much anywhere in the city.",5,2015,05,21
211,Great Customer Service,"Took my partner to Dublin for his birthday and stayed at the Croke Park Hotel, last weekend. Hotel is lovely, customer service was great, food and drink also really nice. would definitely recommend this hotel and would return again! made to feel very welcome.",5,2015,05,21
211,"Modern hotel, ten minute walk from the Liffey","Wonderful stay. Hotel is very modern with excellent staff and amenities. Location is just a bit outside of the downtown, but the walk to all major attraction and the train is very easy. Breakfast was well worth the price - add on at check in for cost savings!",5,2015,05,19
211,Excellent modern Dublin hotel,This hotel has modern decor with up to date furnishings with large bedroom and clean bathroom. The beds are comfortable. It is on a quiet street within walking distance of downtown. The staff is friendly and helpful. A good rate was acquired in travelocity. We would recommend this hotel. Parking is free and convenient. Breakfast was not included at our rate.,5,2015,05,18
211,We enjoyed our stay at The Crock Park Hotel,"The Crock Park Hotel is a great hotel for two reasons: one, the hotel is very nice inside and well maintained and two, the service given to guests is of high standards. When checking in, the reception were very receptive to our needs and tried their best to make our stay comfortable. When dining at the hotel, either for breakfast or dinner, the waiters showed courtesy and looked after us. Room service were also very prompt. 

Our only criticism of the hotel is the location and surrounding areas. The hotel is next to a big grey stadium and the area is generally a bit run down. We were shown some rooms looking toward the back and it was NOT pretty! We requested a different room. It is a 25 minutes walk to the O'connor street but is a little too far for the nicer shopping area (St Stephen's Green). However, taxi's are plenty. 

Overall a very good hotel with great wifi worth the £84 a night.",4,2015,05,18
211,excellent,"Efficient and friendly staff.  Clean comfortable room & great breakfast.
Staff in dining area were particularly helpful and cheerful.
Little extras, like bottles of water on check out was a nice touch too. 
Overall, we would stay again & recommend it to a friend",5,2015,05,18
211,Good stay,"Nothing to complain about. Quick check in, 20 min walk into town. Directly opposite stadium. Corporate hotel, so not a lot of character, but very well maintained, good service, close to car hire drop off places and 15 mins from airport. White company toiletries.",4,2015,05,17
211,Excellent place.,"One of the best hotels in Dublin.
Food is excellent and the service is really good.
The location is great, beteween the City Centre and the Airport, and just across the road from the Croke Park Stadium.",5,2015,05,17
211,Fantastic,"Great hotel with great service, can't wait to come back. Every thing we asked for and more was provided to us. Not central but that's no problem as its only 20 mins from the city centre. I would definitely come back here.",4,2015,05,15
211,Very good hotel,"Nice hotel, very spacious rooms which are fully equipped.
Food in hotel is excellent, I would recommend this hotel to anyone
Staff were very friendly, approachable and helpful, I would go back again for a leisure break.",5,2015,05,15
211,What's NOT to love about this place,"Wife and I spent our last few days of our Ireland trip in Dublin, I opted for the Croke Park Hotel, and I'm glad I did.

The front desk staff were friendly and professional. Bellhop brought up our luggage. We did a small upgrade to our room and was given access to a lounge that had unlimited coffee, tea, fruits and pastry all day. It also had comfortable lounge chairs and couches with a few large screen tv's.

Climate control was spot on, bathroom was clean and well lit, shower gave a steady stream of hot water, lots of small shampoo and body soaps to use if needed. Even had robes and slippers.

Room service was provided for a small fee of 5 euro. Breakfast was tasty and plentiful. Dinner service was provided in the large bar/lounge or restaurant. Service was a bit slow by our American standards, so we just chilled out and waited while sipping our cocktails. The food that arrived was so good we ended up coming back the next night and eating with them again. Awesome stuff.",5,2015,05,14
211,Loved It ;),"Reception area was very nice and modern.  Hotel was very clean.  Room and bathroom were spacious and comfortable.  Location is very good.  A short walk will have you in the heart of Dublin for wonderful food, pubs, shopping and site seeing.  The front desk staff was very accommodating.  They were very helpful in tracking my bag (which the airline lost) and getting it to the hotel.  Thank you so much for a great stay.",5,2015,05,13
211,Hospitality at its finest.,"We arrived at 5:50 a.m. The front desk could not have been nicer in taking our bags, offering coffee, and working to get a room ready. We walked to the city center--straight shot, 10- minute walk--and finally found a place open for breakfast at 7 a.m. The city does not really wake up until after 8 a.m. We came back to the hotel and we were able to go right to our room by 8:30. The fitness facility is bigger than expected with 3 treadmills, free weights, bike, etc. Wi-fi was good.",5,2015,05,13
211,"Croke Park Hotel, Dublin","The room was perfect, bathroom perfect,Chowder in the bar not so good.The young man at reception was not very friendly. The supervisor on reception was excellent and dealt with me in a lovely and professional manner.I would recomment this hotel and as it is across the road from Croke park it is ideal if you are going to a match.",4,2015,05,13
211,Great hotel,"Great hotel!

211,"Wonderful stay in Dublin, Ireland",This hotel was so lovely. Everything was clean and decorated so nicely. The room was large and very comfortable. The bathroom was modern and large. The bar area was so nice and the staff was extremely friendly. The amenities were top notch. A lovely time at the Croke!!,5,2015,05,12
211,Irish Hospitality,"From the minute you enter the front door until the minute you exit through the front door, you are treated with the utmost respect, appreciation of your business and like true royalty.  The hotel is so clean you could literally eat off the floor! Nothing like getting into a super comfy bed with fresh crisp white Irish linens.  The restaurant is phenomenal with food ranging from typical Irish cuisine to other dishes with an international flair.  You feel like you are dining in a five star restaurant, but the prices won't break your pocket book. They have a wonderful workout room with state of the art equipment, a great business center with high speed internet.  The hotel environment is very welcoming; a home away from home.  The staff in all departments of The Croke Park are knowledgeable and accommodating.  You are within very close proximity to the City Centre; walking distance, public bus or taxi.  You can even get on the Green Hop On/Hop Off bus tour right outside the hotel (one of the best tour companies in Dublin) You are close by to the Dublin International Airport, the major train stations, grocery stores, and pubs.  I have traveled the world extensively and HIGHLY RECOMMEND The Croke Park---YOU WILL NOT BE DISAPPOINTED!!!!",5,2015,05,12
211,Wonderful stay...,"I will start with the negative to get it out of the way, ""location"", not a pretty area, it's across from a stadium, but to my surprise, it was quiet (no games at the stadium during my stay), safe and only a 15 minutes walk to the city center.
The rest...let's say ""excellent"". Large super clean rooms with double size bed and all the amenities that you may need in the room.  Housekeeping does a great job not missing one single detail.  The whole staff, superb, professional but not stiffed at all, on the contrary very pleasant and helpful.  My FIVE stars to the kitchen/chef and the restaurant staff, the food was so good at the hotel that we decided to have breakfast and dinner there every single day.  Thank you Croke Park staff :)",4,2015,05,12
211,Very Surprised - Quality Hotel ,"The Croke Park hotel is certainly not false advertising - Croke Park is at the entrance to the hotel. My expectation was that this would be a functional hotel and nothing more ... I was so wrong. 
Excellent service, nice rooms, seven breakfast and good food in the bar. The staff were very friendly and went above and beyond, every time with a smile. 
The rooms are large, clean and very quiet with large bright bathrooms. The hotel feels like it is very well run and maintained. 
I would certainly return. 

",5,2015,05,12
211,Great hotel,One of the nicest hotels we have stayed in.  Friendly staff and the concierges Steven and Christopher were very helpful.  Good breakfast buffet.  The Hop-On/Hop-Off stops at the hotel 4 times a day and tickets can be purchased at the front desk.  It is about a 20 minute walk from the town center to the hotel.,5,2015,05,11
211,Fabulous hotel,"I have stayed here a number of times with my wife and also with friends for music concerts and also sporting events. I can't rate The Croke Park Hotel highly enough, every time I stay here I can't get over how friendly and helpful all the staff are. The bar and restaurant are very nice and relaxing. The hotel is a short walk from the city centre and has an underground carpark which is very handy. I am looking forward to going back this June for the weekend.",5,2015,05,11
211,Another excellent stay,"Had another relaxing comfortable stay at the Croke Park Hotel. The staff are excellent and really try hard to make you feel welcome the executive lounge is great and the self service quick breakfast is really a great option. Very close to the city center, excellent value for money
Would definitely recommend this hotel for everyone",5,2015,05,11
211,Great stay,"I went to Dublin for May bank holiday. The hotel is awesome,  I parked in the hotel underground parking and went to check in. The reception desk staff is very attentive - got hot towel while checking in. The whole process took 5 minutes and I could go to my room. I have no bad words about the room, very clean and comfy. Love the bathroom and free wifi speed is also good. The small complain I have is that I was put in the room next to the elevator so people leaving at 4am woke me up, this can be overcome with ear plugs but unfortunately I did not bring mine and the room did not have it in. When I check out I left my car in the parking and went to the City centre again, got a bottle of water to take with me from reception which is very nice touch. I will be definitely back to this hotel and recommend it to everyone",5,2015,05,10
211,Welcomed Relief to the Weary Traveler,"After a long flight from the US, we were relieved to arrive at this hotel early in the day.  The hotel was quite accommodating and allowed early check-in.  We were quite pleased with the room and bath which were reasonably sized and comfortable.  We enjoyed a very complete breakfast in AM.  Free underground parking provided on site.",5,2015,05,10
211,beautiful hotel with lovely staff,"We stayed 5 nights in this hotel. We really loved it. The staff was always nice. rooms are clean and the fourniture is very charming.

We were lucky with the weather. So we could make the 10 -15 minutes walk to the city centre.

we will be back :-)",5,2015,05,10
211,"Friendly staff, great facilites","We stayed at the Croke Park Hotel for one night and were very impressed. Our triple room was a huge family room and the staff were all very friendly, helpful and efficient. Excellent dining, great value.",5,2015,05,10
211,Family,"This hotel is so fantastic, the amenities, location are the Best! Arrived early had the Irish breakfast, Eggs, Bangers, White and Black pudding. The works, I was so full could not eat all day, hahaha. The rooms are modern and comfortable, the beds are GREAT!! The Bar is a happening spot, with 20 tap beers, of course had the Guinness, you have to in Ireland! Then switched to Carlsberg, had to start watching the waistline. The walk to City center is 20 min longer when you start to notice the beautiful buildings and people. I LOVE IRELAND! ! Will definitely return to this fabulous city, and stay at this fantastic hotel!!",5,2015,05,08
211,Convenient location with parking,"I chose this hotel because it had parking.  Many Dublin hotels do not have their own parking facilities, and as we were travelling to many business meetings it was important to be on the move quickly after our night's stay.  The car park was undercover, and this is always a benefit.  The hotel staff were very welcoming and helpful.  The rooms were well appointed and the bar food was fine.",5,2015,05,08
211,Holiday Trip,"We stayed at the Croke at the end of a 14 day CIE tour. The room was fine and the restaurant/bar was nice. The hotel is several blocks walk to downtown which we found inconvenient. Being by the stadium may be a plus.
              ",3,2015,05,08
211,Comfy beds,"I theroughly enjoyed my stay here. The beds were very comfortable. The rooms were exceptionally quiet, the windows all had black out curtains and no maids came by until after 11am, which I highly appreciated. Room service was around the clock, which we utilized. The only complaint was that the breakfast took too long to get to us and thus was cold. Everyone in reception was very nice and very helpful. Concierge was very nice and well informed. Hotel is close to the airport and a close walk to the city center. It is on the opposit side of the Liffey so very quiet come sleep time. If you are headed to the stadium it is directly across the street, which is probably why the rooms are sound proofed and have black out curtains. Maids were very kind, very thorough, they hung up clothes we left on the ground, fully cleaned our room and bathroom. Even organized our make up and toiletries on the counter for us. Separate shower and bathtub was a plus. Restaurant was good, food was tasty, although Ireland has a thing for puréeing their soups, this hotel included, which I am not a big fan of. The service was good for Ireland service, however, in all of Ireland service is slow. They take their time, especially bringing your check.",4,2015,05,07
211,Nice Hotel Near City Center,"Upon arrival in Ireland from the US, we booked a room at the Croke Park hotel to overnight before heading out of Dublin.  Check-in was fast and friendly.  Our room was clean and no issues.  We decided to walk down to the city center to grab some lunch.  The walking distance from the hotel is maybe a little more than a mile.  The front desk gave us directions, which were easy to follow.  Upon returning we decided to have an adult beverage and snack before heading up to the room.  The lounge area is ample in size, plus they have one wall where they are projecting sporting events.  The wait staff are very efficient.  The next morning before checking out we grab some breakfast from the buffet.  There was plenty of food, and it tasted really good.  I would recommend this hotel if you want to stay around the stadium or the downtown area.",4,2015,05,07
211,Absolutely wonderful hotel - a short walk from Dublin City Centre,"My partner and I stayed here last weekend for a bit of a romantic break and chose the Croke Park Hotel because of its outstanding reviews on TripAdvisor. 

 I have to say, we weren't disappointed. 

The rooms are lovely and spacious, equipped with mini bar and White Company toiletries. The bed was super comfy and the room very quiet. 

The staff at the hotel couldn't do enough for you - from the friendly reception staff to the efficient bar staff, we were looked after from the very beginning. 

The Croke Park also has a very nice bar with a huge fire and an absolutely gigantic big screen - perfect for watching the football! The prices are also very reasonable by hotel bar standards and we found it to be cheaper than in town. 

No need to bother with a taxi, Parnell Street is a short 20 minute walk away - although you may get lost on your first trip, so I always recommend using your iPhone map. 

Another pleasant walk is the walk to Glasnevin Cemetary and the Botanic Gardens that are roughly a mile away. There is a lovely cafe called (Cafe Station?) on the high street that does a   tasty breakfast that is much better quality than the ones you will get in town (see my review about Murrays). 

All in all, an absolutely fantastic trip and would highly recommend the Croke Park as a base for exploring Dublin.",5,2015,05,06
211,Amazing hotel for a great price,"I had a fantastic stay at the Croke Park Hotel in Dublin. It was a great price especially considering how nice the hotel was. Super clean rooms, really comfortable beds, quiet atmosphere, nice lobby and hotel bar/restaurant, easy (and free) parking situation, good wifi, and friendly, helpful staff.  Overall, I was really happy with my stay here and if I ever come back to Dublin, I will definitely stay here again.  

One thing to note: it's about a 15/20 min walk into the Temple Bar area, or a 5/10 min cab ride (about 10 Euros), so if you're looking to do the party scene in Dublin, I'd say budget money for cab rides home.  Another option is the bus which stops a few minutes away from the hotel, I didn't ride the bus but my friend did and she said it was pretty easy.  Would highly recommend this hotel!",5,2015,05,06
211,Fantastic stay from start to finish.,"Me and my partner stayed here from 26th-30th April. 

This is an absolutely lovely hotel and the staff are outstanding. They brought us a card and champagne up to our room for my partners birthday which was a really lovely touch.

Breakfast was really nice with a great selection every day - again staff service was fab. Only thing I could say is that they could clear the plates slightly quicker when finished eating, as all guests were sat finished and if you want to get something extra like fruit, piling plates up isn't ideal. That is a really picky fault that I wouldn't have even noticed if everything else wasn't brilliant! We ate once at the hotel and we were impressed - lovely food.

Room spacious, very clean and beds comfy. We were in 118 and in the morning the room was quite dark due to being in a corner but again, didn't effect the quality of our stay. 

I would 100% recommend this hotel. It is close to Dublin City Centre and also a fairly cheap taxi ride away from the airport.

If I return to Dublin I will definitely be booking this hotel.",5,2015,05,06
211,Outstanding stay at the Croke Park Hotel,"The staff at Croke Park were outstanding and by far one of the best hotel experiences I've ever had!!  I travel a lot for work/pleasure, and I was very impressed with the attention to detail from check-in to check-out.   Thank you Croke Park for making my first visit to Ireland a truly memorable journey.  ",5,2015,05,05
211,Would definitely recommend it,"As people mentioned before, this is a great hotel. The room was clean and tidy, the staff very friendly and the breakfast exactly what you would expect from a  4* hotel. WiFi is free and smooth.

Very easy to find the hotel if you are coming from the airport (5 minute walks from Drumcondra Stop for the Air Coach) and just a short walk from the city centre. The only drawback is the view from the rooms. You either see the stadium or a big empty industrial space with lots of bins and parked cars.",5,2015,05,05
211,Great hotel,"The Croke Park Hotel is a great place to stay. Rooms were spacious and clean. Maid service was exceptional, and quiet. The rooms are very very quiet and can get very dark with curtains pulled to help sleep with jet lag. It's close to City Centre a 15 minute walk and very safe. Room service is around the clock which is very nice.
",4,2015,05,05
211,Lovely Hotel,"I stayed here on a Monday and there was no Match at the stadium opposite.
The hotel is very well maintained and the rooms are large with a separate shower and bath.
Lovely light duvet and squishy soft pillows. 
Sensible room for relaxing during the day with comfortable lounger chair.
Near the airport and city without being in it.
If I had a constructive criticism it would be to replenish the fried eggs regularly. They were a little hard and rubbery, however delighted to see fresh soda bread.
Lovely evening meal. Not cheap though very tasty.
Excellent service from the lovely Irish members of staff.",5,2015,05,05
211,Fantastic Hotel,"Over the past 6 months I've stayed at The Croke Park dozens of time (if not more!). A really great hotel with big spacious rooms and all the modcons. Food is delicious and staff are very accommodating when trying to eat healthily. Wifi is great, much better than I've found in other hotels in the area.",5,2015,05,05
211,Excellent hotel,"My boyfriend and I stayed at the hotel last night.The location was great and the staff of the hotel were friendly and so helpful.The only small thing is the deluxe room was pretty basic compared to others I have stayed at,but overall I will certainly be back at this wonderful hotel! ",5,2015,05,04
211,Great stay,"Staff helpful, location is good and the rooms are kept very clean. If in was to never return to Dublin wouldn't have any problems staying here again. You can walk into the main centre in around 15 minutes so ideal for exploring",4,2015,05,03
211,This hotel is the business,"My colleagues and I stayed here on a large business trip.  We arrived in the afternoon and were met by very friendly and helpful staff who helped us take care of a few administrative chores at the small but effective business centre.  I checked into my room and found it clean, well appointed and spacious.  We met at the hotel bar around 1930 and enjoyed attentive service and reasonably priced drinks for an hour.  The star was the snack mix (I think it is bespoke) that they kept the tables stocked with.

The bed was very comfortable and I slept extremely well.  The shower had good pressure in the morning and the selection of complementary toiletries was better than usual.  I had a very good Full Irish Breakfast in the morning at a reasonable rate and the staff were once again helpful and pleasant on checkout.

The hotel is about a 15 minute walk from the centre of town, but I think it probably makes sense to take a taxi given the number of ""youths"" in some of the areas adjacent to the hotel, especially if a group consists of mostly women.  The hotel can't really don't much about this, but I think it is worth noting.  I'd also mention that the T.V. in the room was a bit smaller than average, though I didn't even turn it one.

This was quite a nice hotel, and if there were a match on at Croke Park would be an excellent location.  The only reason that this didn't get 5 stars is because my expectations have recently been stretched and reset by a stay at a Crowne Plaza hotel.",4,2015,05,02
211,"Not impressed, 3.5 star rating not 5 (Bistrowas good)","Don't be fooled by the public area appearance, the rooms are less impressive than the lobby. Both single and double bed were hard and rigid. Pillows were thin and ended up hurting my neck. Single bed covers were on tighter than a drum head skin. Single bed moved around as it was of a light construction and on roller wheels that did not have locks. Sat on it and it moved out from under me. Laid on it with my back against the headboard and it rolled out from under me. The soloution, send concierge to the room with large styrofoam cardboard covered coffee cups and cut them down to fit under the wheels and against the bed. 

Room lighting was inconsitant. Different lamps in side table lights and a oversized bulb in floor lamp side fixture. TV was not color corrected properly and dark in contrast.

Bistro dinner service was nice and the chef accomodated and came up with a nice plate of food for a member of the family with food allergies. Breakfast was nice, but fruit was to young and still green and hard on some of the mellons. Hasbrowns (potatoe triangles) were soggy and you could still see the oil in them from frying. (tip to staff: another place I stayed at used white bread to rest the hashbrowns on which absorbed the oil and some of the steam vapor leaving them crisper than yours)

Staff is friendly and acoomodating in their standard service roles. ",3,2015,05,02
211,Ms,"This is the first review I have made. I booked this hotel based on the good reviews in this site. 

I was surprised though how many hen night and stag parties there were, there was a large singing hen party at dinner and it is aimed for more 18-30 party goers 
I didn't get any sleep I asked for a quiet room but was put next to a young Eastern European group of lads  who kept me awake most of the night .. when I did drop off I was woken at 4 by someone loudly being sick !  

When I looked in my mini bar for some soft drink refreshments I had none, when I checked I was missing most of it I thought it was odd I had alcohol but only water to accompany it.

When I mentioned this to the hotel staff they were not overly concerned .. 

So this hotel is ok if you are in Dublin for a party time. I think the good reviews on here are over generous to this hotel and people must have not been to a genuinely good hotel !",3,2015,05,02
211,Great place forbour last night in Ireland,"A very nice motel with all the mod cons. We were part of a tour group and spent our last night there. The rooms were large and clean, staff were courteous and professional. The food was fine.
There was nothing overly spectacular or otherwise, it was just a nice hotel in a big city.",4,2015,05,01
211,very good,"first class hotel the hotel staff where very friendly and helpful ,rooms comfortable breakfast was amazing,bar prices where roughly the same as in the city centre,taxi into the city for six people was 15euro",5,2015,05,01
211,Overnight stay 29th April 2015,"Myself and my family had an excellent however brief overnight stay following our daughters 21st birthday party in Dublin City Center.The staff were most helpfull at check-in and efficiently processed same even though it was getting late at night. The bar staff were most helpful in facilitating some late night drinks which crowned the night off in a most enjoyable fashion.
There was a bit of drama next morning when my son realised that he had left his school uniform in the lift the prev night and needed it to go to school in Navan -however with envaluable assistance from reception staff it was handed back at 8am in time for departure .In all the experience was excellent and we departed with full bellies from the harty breakfast that morning.",5,2015,05,01
211,A nice hotel,"A nice hotel directly across from the Croke Park stadium. While a bit outside of downtown Dublin, it was a short walk to everything in the city. We enjoyed our stay here. We had a slight medical emergency, and the hotel staff was extremely helpful in calling a doctor to come to the hotel and tend to our matter. The hotel was clean, the breakfast was great, and the room/bathroom were extremely spacious. We'd stay here again, and at the very least, recommend it to someone traveling to Dublin on a budget.",5,2015,04,30
211,Great hotel with very friendly staff,"We hose this hotel as it offered a package deal including meals and tickets to Dublin Zoo.  We thought originally hat it would just do as a base to allow us to travel, but the hotel was so nice and the staff were so friendly we spent a lot of our time there.

After we had booked (a very simple experience over the phone) we realised that there were some football matches on in the stadium next door the same weekend, so were a bit worried about being stuck in with hundreds of fans and not enjoying the experience, but the hotel had everything extremely well organised and there was no problem getting a table in the dining room, bar, etc.

The food was great, and the staff went out of their way to help our child get sandwiches she would eat! Very good breakfast service and great wifi provision.  We would definitely stay here again.",5,2015,04,30
211,Business Trip,"I found the staff extremely helpful and friendly. The room were spacious and had all of the requirements that any traveller would require. 
I would highly recommend the hotel, staff and food and would return in the future. ",5,2015,04,30
211,Very good hotel with top service,"the Hotel is directly at the croke park, 5 minutes from the inner city by taxi.
Very clean, very  nice atmosphere, very good service and easy check in and check out.
We booked the hotel with 5 guys in one romm for two and one room for three. the rooms are big enough. the breakfast ist very good, we didnt dine there, so i cant say anything about the meals. the concierge was very nice and had a lot of good tips, like the restaurant Fallon & Byrne and some pubs ...he told us not to go to temple bar but in another area where the irish go...lots of pubs...wonderful....he also gave us tickets for a GAA Game in the stadium for freee! 5 Stars!",5,2015,04,29
211,Trip to dublin,Picked this hotel because of good reviews and it did not disappoint 15 minute walk to centre but weather was good so it was a nice walk really nice hotel and liked it was a it out of centre would return on our next trip to dublin,4,2015,04,29
211,Nice hotel but very poor disabled facilities,A nice hotel but very impersonal.  The room was great but finding it was a huge problem as the signage is poor.  The parking facilities are very poor and there appears to be only one disabled space which is constantly blocked by coaches.  Trying to get to the car park in the one available life proved to be a nightmare.  Not a good hotel for the disabled.,4,2015,04,27
211,Amazing hotel! Lovely staff,"Stayed at this hotel from a friday - sunday in April.. arrived at the hotel around 11am and were able to go straight to our room.. Staff were really welcoming, hotel is decorated really nicely and really clean. We had a triple room which was very spacious for 3 girls on a drinking weekend! Beds were reaaally comfy! Plenty of mirrors, 2 chairs, lots of wardrobe and draw space. Our bathroom was massive with a big walk in shower and separate bath. Breakfast was lovely for a buffet, all the usual stuff and the fry up bits tasted really nice and not greasy! Had a drink in the bar on the first day which was a yummy cocktail and didnt cost too much.. all the staff were really friendly, chatty and down to earth. On the saturday night we asked if we could order a dominos to the room and they said it was fine and gave our room a call when it arrived! They will call you a taxi when you need to go anywhere and it only costs around €10-12 to Temple Bar with the tip they include. Lovely hotel, lovely people and a lovely place! Will definitely be staying here again if I come back to Dublin, would definitely say its suitable for couples, friends and families",5,2015,04,27
211,Very good standard hotel,"I've stayed here a couple of times for work and it has always been a good experience overall, the bedrooms being of a good standard and nice and comfortable. I've had better breakfasts but the general level of service is good and it is convenient for work across the road at the stadium.",4,2015,04,27
211,Family Weekend of Celebrations,"We have just returned from a family weekend away, as a family we had 13 rooms booked in total. We had a great weekend. Each and everyone one of us was looked after beyond belief, the hotel acknowldeged all of our requirements and celebrations, and left tokens of celebrations in our room, the satff were AMAZING, Food was FIRST CLASS, Hotel in general is PERFECT for family get together's. We had a ball and enjoyed everything so much! Thanks so all the staff at Croke Park Hotel. Additional to this, I must inform readers that the hotel was jammed to capacity with ongoing events in Croke Park, BUT the hotel was still able to cater for everyone and were still able to keep their premises spotlessly clean and secure for children. There was more than enough staff on to ensure that evryone was been looked after to the highest of standards. The Mc Keever Family ",5,2015,04,27
211,Return trip,"My husband and I like to visit Ireland and we have family here. We stayed at the Croke Park Hotel in Oct. of 2013. We loved the hotel and did not consider anywhere else in Dublin. We arrived on April 21 and stayed one night, but will return for two nights at the end of our trip. We like everything about the hotel but the best part is the lovely people that work there!",5,2015,04,26
211,Really pleasant weekend break at the Croke Park Hotel,"We stayed here as a family of 4 for a weekend in April for the 1st time. I am a Platinum Card holder for the GHA Discovery program - so curious to see how this Hotel shaped up. We had a fantastic time - courteous staff, excellent room with the bathroom in particular v.good - looks like new fittings. Breakfasts were excellent, and we ate in the restaurant which was again very good. The bar area is a very pleasant place to relax - and very popular for that reason. Free parking in secure basement - excellent. Very impressed & we all had a great stay, Highly recommended and suspect we will be back soon !",5,2015,04,25
211,excellent hotel,"from once we arrived at reception until we checked out  we were treated extremely well 
we were on the 4th Floor and  had access to the executive lounge. 
a superior hotel with great rooms great service and great food.
definitely will be back.",5,2015,04,25
211,Most welcoming hotel.,"We have just returned from a 5 night stay. Everything was lovely, the staff, the rooms, facilities. We were made to feel welcome from the start and nothing was too much trouble. A special mention to Siobhan, who was particularly helpful and also arranged for some complimentary prosecco as it was my birthday the day after we were leaving. We had a deluxe room which is worth the extra, the continental breakfast in the executive lounge is a lovely touch. We were also given vouchers for a complimentary drink each night in the bar. Location wise it was perfect for us as it was far enough away from the city centre so it was quieter, but no too far too walk, about 15/20 minutes. We were lucky with the weather and so ended up walking to most attractions from the hotel. Perfect hotel x
",5,2015,04,25
211,Excellent!,"Stayed here with my family when we were up in Dublin for a short break.

Hotel is located right across the road from Croke Park stadium, so is the perfect place to stay if you are heading to Dublin for a match!

Dublin City transport is excellent so buses and taxis are nearby and plentiful.

Our room was very nice. Spacious (for a family room) and very clean & tidy. We had a view of the stadium from our window.

We ate in the restaurant that night and had breakfast there the next morning. Food was great and service very good too.

Reception staff were friendly and helpful upon check-in and also when we were checking out.

We managed to book the family room for the night for under the €100 mark which I thought represented good value for a hotel of this quality. Though its worth pointing out that breakfast was not included in this rate.

So, as you can see, myself and my family were very impressed with The Croke Park Hotel. Staff were professional and helpful, our room was nice and clean, and the food was very good too.

Well done guys!",5,2015,04,23
211,Fantastic stay at this hotel,"The rooms were a good size with great housekeeping every day, all staff very helpful and friendly, check in easy and would recommend staying at this hotel. It's about 15 minutes walk to O'Connell street and about 5 in a taxi for 11 euros from the temple bar area.",4,2015,04,23
211,Great hotel and staff,"I had to spend a few nights at the Croke Park Hotel for business recently and given that I am pretty familiar with the area, I was somewhat sceptical about it's rating as the 3rd best hotel in Dublin. 

Check in was very efficient and it was noticable that there was plenty of staff troughout the hotel. You never really waited for anything and every staff member seemed to be polite and cheerful which is a real asset to the hotel.

My room was located at the back of the hotel and was fitted out with a fantastic array of amenities. Tea/coffee, trouser press, minibar, safe, hifi and extra bedding. The bed was comfortable and I slept very well. The bathroom was spacious, bright and clean and had a separate bath and shower with plenty of towels, gels and soaps.

Breakfast was a decent affair with ample amounts of hot and cold options although the glasses provided for the juices were a bit on the small side. I found myself having to get up 3 or 4 times to refill my glass. The hot food was tasty and plentiful and there was also the usual selection of cereals to choose from. Tea, coffee and toast are served to your table.

The Sideline bar was not overly expensive for a hotel bar and would be similarly priced to what you would expect to pay in most pubs around town. 

All in all, despite it's rating on Tripadvisor, this is not the third best hotel in Dublin and it is in a bit of a weird location. You would think that being located next to the largest staium in Ireland it would have better transport links but I suppose you're only a few minutes walk away by bus but you will have to walk unless you arrive by taxi. It would be about a 25-30 minute walk to Grafton Street/Temple Bar.

That being said, it is a very good hotel with excellent staff and I would be happy to recommend it.",4,2015,04,23
211,Wonderful stay,"We were contacted prior to our stay to obtain our preferences and the hotel arranged transportation to and from the airport (for a charge). The front desk and concierge were friendly and helpful. Rooms are large and comfortable, the lobby is inviting, and the walk to downtown Dublin is only a few minutes. We felt spoiled the whole time we stayed there. I can't recommend it enough!",5,2015,04,23
211,Very pleasant experience,"My partner and I stayed here for 2 nights, 18-19 April 2015. Very welcoming feel in reception area and check-in was quick and painless. Receptionist very helpful, polite and informative. Our room on 4th floor was immaculate and spotless with all the facilities one could want - tea/coffee making facilities, bottled water, robes etc. The bed was huge, very comfortable and worth staying in for a while. Complimentary continental breakfast was satisfying; I'm not a big breakfast fan. The hotel is located about 30 minute walk from O'Connell Street but that gives a visitor an opportunity to explore the delights of this great city. My only complaint was the price of a glass of wine - 8.75 euros for a small glass. All in all a very relaxing stay. Would recommend to anyone any day.",5,2015,04,23
211,Family friendly superb hotel,From arrival to departure we were made feel so welcome. Staff treated kids same as adults included them (eg on arrival we received 4 hot towels) staff spoke to the kids and when eating were very quick to supply colouring and bring there food Asaph. Kids menu very reasonable as was the main menu. Food was fabulous both at dinner and breakfast. Room was perfect in every way. Definitely will be back for another visit ,5,2015,04,21
211,"Pleasant, comfortable hotel","Very nice stay, comfortable hotel next to Croke Park. Nice staff, excellent food in the restaurant with very good service. Plan ahead and use the shuttle from here to in town to the hop-on. Last time we walked and found the area uncomfortable, but you can take the morning shuttle in and one late afternoon back, it's very convenient. Check lobby signs for times. 
Very spacious rooms, quiet, recommended for sure.",5,2015,04,21
211,Great experience,"Outstanding hotel & would 1000% recommend to anyone. Everything is exceptional from the staff, rooms, gym everything. The staff couldn't do enough for you! 15 minute walk from town centre & we're lucky enough the 2 days we spent the weather was beautiful. Would defo come back! ",5,2015,04,21
211,Weekend visit,"Fabulous hotel had a lovely time the food service and accommodation was faultless...
The attention to details is to their credit and just a short walk from the city centre...
Thank you very much to everyone that looked after us we had a great time.",5,2015,04,20
211,"Convenient Location, Spacious Room and Good Breakfast","The Good
The hotel is located beside Croak Park and within easy reach of public transportation.  It also offers free hotel shuttle service to a nearby business district thereby saving you/your company money for taxi fares. 

The room I got is spacious with complete amenities like flat iron, slippers (very important), ample cloth hangers, notepad etc.  

The breakfast selection, as typical of most European Hotels, offer hot meals (sausages, bacon, mushrooms etc.) and continental breakfast.  They have fresh yoghurt with a selection of preserved fruit toppings - this is something new for me as most hotels I've stayed with offer pre-packed yoghurt.  

Need Improvement
1.  The door bolt in my bedroom cannot bolt properly - there seems to be some wood chips that are blocking the bolt from going thru the other side.  This happened 2 days in a row and it is the same lady who offered me turn down service and chocolates who fixed the problem.
2.  I've taken a shower in the gym and the shower drain is clogged.  The water pools up inside the shower.  Very unhygienic.
3.  The TV in the room offer limited (maybe 3-4) American TV shows only and the rest are either news or sports.  I would have preferred more selection. 

",4,2015,04,20
211,Great Hotel,"Stayed there for one night in April and just randomly picked it I was very impressed. 

Staff were helpful and allowed me to check in early, I had a room with a double bed and a single one! Beds were comfy and the bathroom was a great size. 

The noise in the hotel was at a minimum and made for a great nights sleep. 

It may be a little away from the city center but the walk in there is great and you get to take in a lot of the sights. 

Certainly would try and stay here again when I am next in Dublin.",5,2015,04,20
211,Weekend stay,"Went to Dublin with my boyfriend for his birthday and had the most amazing time, this hotel definitely added to the great experience, best hotel I've ever stayed in. Service was impeccable, the hotel itself spotless. Would 100% stay again, the breakfast was beautiful too. 
The rooms were beautiful, I loved the huge windows.
A little cheaper than your average 4 star hotel in Dublin as it's a 20 minute walk from town, but as we're both students this suited us fine. 
Highly recommend from all aspects! 
              
              ",5,2015,04,19
211,Comfy,"Lovely welcoming staff, was there the end of March 2015. lovely rooms and a massive bathroom. There are no bad points, if i have to think of one it would be its a bit out of the town centre but not a problem.",5,2015,04,18
211,Wonderful Hotel,"We loved everything about this hotel.  The excellent food service, the breakfast that was brought to our room in the morning.  Nice location and very nice accommodations.  The staff was super friendly and helpful.",5,2015,04,17
211,croke park hotel,"My family and I recently returned from Dublin Ireland.  We were extremely fortunate to stay at the Croke Park Hotel for fourteen days.  The hotel is spotless, the staff accommodating and friendly and very knowledgeable.  We were blessed to meet Catherine McKenna who is definitely a star in the hotel management team at the hotel.
We had read some reviews about the hotel not being close to the city center and not convenient to the city.  We did not find this to be true.  We walked to the city on many occasions and when we took a taxi, it cost us less than 10 Euros.  We definitely recommend this hotel for anyone travelling to Ireland. ",5,2015,04,17
211,Very recommendable!,It is my 4th stay in the Croke Park Hotel and I couldn't fault it for anything. The rooms are spacious and very clean. The food is reasonable priced and very good. But most of all the staff is most helpful and very friendly. I am looking forward to staying there for the 5th time.,5,2015,04,17
211,Business trip,"Very good hotel. The rooms were clean and modern and it was well located. The breakfast was average but sufficient for the start of the day. Car parking made travelling easier as it can be quite difficult in Dublin.
              
              
              ",4,2015,04,16
211,Friendly Place and a Friendly Hotel,"It was our first trip to Dublin for some time so we had almost forgotten to expect the warm and friendly Irish greeting, which we duly received. The staff were efficient and attentive, and could not do enough to help out. 
We booked B&B and despite the hotel being 90% full, and consequently breakfast being busy, we only had a slight wait to be seated for a table one day out of four and on that day only for a few minutes. The breakfast was good and there was plenty available even just before 10.30 when breakfast ended. The one meal we had in the evening was also excellent and well priced for a 4 star hotel.
The rooms were sizeable and clean although there was a strange arrangement with the fridge which did not seem to open; plus there was a sign saying it was only for hotel produce. This is probably my only criticism of the hotel and I am sure we would stay here again.",5,2015,04,16
211,Wonderful Experince,Stayed at the Croke Park Hotel last evening. It was very convenient to the Airport and easy to find. Parking was free and very accessible. The staff are super friendly and attentive wonderful atmosphere in the Bar area and the food was excellent. The seafood chowder is to be recommended as  is the steak dish. The room had every luxury comfort and room service was prompt with minimal charge. A wake up call was renewed every 15 mins from the front desk staff and bottled water was given on check out. All in all an excellent flagship hotel for the Croke Park Area!! Well done to all!,5,2015,04,15
211,100% consistent,"I stay here for work frequently - they are so consistent in providing a great experience that is wonderful. Staff so friendly. Good food, good gym, quiet, clean.
A bit of a walk to the tourist center but I don't mind the walk.",5,2015,04,15
211,Fastest WIFI every experienced 60 Mbps download with 10Mbps upload - Great Hotel as well,"Efficient, warm and friendly staff, with large quiet rooms, and when I say quiet I mean almost silent. If I were being pedantic I would have liked a high def flat screen tv and a power shower with some oomph. However realistically, the amenities are very good considering the competitive pricing. The food was excellent, the service impeccable and complete with real smiles. (not the dead behind the eyes variety).",5,2015,04,15
211,Excellent hotel.,"Booked 2 room for six of us to stay, 4 adults and two kids with expedia. Everything was perfect on arrival, with nice big rooms and loads of extra towels. Breakfast was good quality with a wide choice.
About 15min walk to city centre or just over a tenner in taxi.",5,2015,04,15
211,Mrs Peat,"Arrived to a warm welcome, hotel is great, very clean and tidy, bathroom a dream. Ate in bar slower service than dining room/bistro but food great. Not far from centre you can walk in 15 minutes, parking easy at hotel car park below hotel is free, lift to rooms.",5,2015,04,14
211,Will Return,Spent a night here with my husband and two children over the Easter holidays.  It was a fab hotel.  The parking in city center Dublin is a definite bonus as the hotel is just a short ramble from O Connell Street.  The staff are excellent. The hotel is spotless and the breakfast is grt.  On the negative side the room was too hot but that is our fault for not adjusting the air con and the bed was a bit uncomfortable but again that is a matter of taste.  I will definitely return and in future will use this hotel for all my trips to Dublin.,4,2015,04,14
211,I want to go back.,"The Croke Park Hotel is just a short taxi ride from the airport.

The people at the hotel were so warm and lovely. Asked if we were shopping, gave us warm towels and were really friendly and engaging. 

Check in was fast and the rooms were lovely. The breakfast in the Executive suite was so lovely. Jazz music, a lounge and good food. The selection was not huge, but it had the right things.

The staff on this hotel are all lovely. Knocked on our door and asked if they could do anything to help our stay, smiled and said hello when we passed. Etc.

The wifi was excellent too. 

The only negative (If I'm gonna look for it), is perhaps the location. The area around looked a little tired. But we felt safe when walking here in daylight. We usually walked to the city from the hotel, or took a cab. Both worked fine.

Summed up: excellent, nice, warm and service oriented hotel and people. We are probably going back ;)",5,2015,04,13
211,IT WAS GREAT,"The Croke Park hôtel is situated just near the Dublin stadium, and because of Dublin city have human size, it's not so far from the city center. So its geographical position was not a problem. 
The standing of The Croke Park Hôtel give it great. The reception membrer ship was like mirror, so it was very professionnal. 
 ",5,2015,04,13
211,Fantastic stay,"Family group of 13 stayed for 2 nights to celebrate graduation. The staff were extremely friendly & helpful,from reception to bar & restaurant. Must give a big thanks to Steve the concierge, nothing too much trouble. 
All the bedrooms were large & very comfortable,with all the extras we come to expect from 4* hotels. 
We ate in the restaurant on the first night. The food was good overall,our only niggle of the whole weekend was that it took a long time to come(over an hour) we had small children that were getting tired waiting for their dinner. This nearly put us off eating at the hotel the second night but I'm glad we gave it another chance. The service in the bar was much quicker, it was quieter,so we had a room off the bar to ourselves. The staff went all out to accommodate the different requests all the kids had with great pleasure, they really made it easy for the adults to relax & enjoy the night. 
Ideal place to stay if attending Croke Park,but need a car to get around.
Overall we had a great time staying here & would definitely stay again.",5,2015,04,12
211,Wonderful hotel,"This was my 4th stay at the Croke Park Hotel and I will definitely be staying again especially if the price is right.  The price is usual good if there's no football on.  It's a spotlessly clean and comfortable hotel and only 15 mins walking to city centre.  The staff are very friendly and go out of their way to help. The facilities i.e. computer/printer in lobby is really a bonus especially when you have to print out boarding passes for flights.  Breakfast is delicious and a great variety.  We will definitely be staying here again,",5,2015,04,12
211,Always a pleasure!,"Myself and my partner have stayed in this hotel at least 6 times in the past year and find it difficult to stay in other hotels as this is of such a high standard! The staff are absolutely lovely and welcoming.... Can't do enough for you! The beds are soooo comfy . The hotel is pristinely clean and the location suits us.... Around a 12 min walk
Into town. Just near enough to enjoy it but not hear it!!! We always eat at least one night of our stay as the food is fab and reasonably priced ....Best lamb stew I've had in years!!!! Thank you Sean and Catherine for your wonderfull hospitality and accomadating us as always .....Also thanks to all your amazing team... Thank  you Ian ... Philip and Dympna  at the front desk for minding us and taking the time to make recommendations .....you are all so good at what you do ....we tried all the places yee suggested and had a fantastic trip.... Looking forward to seeing yee all again soon! ",5,2015,04,11
211,A great all round hotel!,"Stayed here for 3 nights in April. We were really lucky with the weather so the walk to oconnell street was enjoyable and no longer than 15minutes! The hotel staff were great, our flight in to dublin was early morning - 8am - and I emailed ahead to the hotel previous to ask if there was any chance of storing our bags. When we arrived our room was ready for early check in which was fab after 7 hours of travelling! Hot towel on arrival to freshen up. Room was lovely, very spacious, clean & modern & executive sweet was lovely with snacks & drinks available 24hours. Only niggle about the room was there was an awful creeking noise when another door close by was opened & closed (can only assume it was chambermaids) woke us up every morning but not something to complain about. Chambermaids were fab, they were like amazing bedroom fairies. Bed made, towels replaced & toiletries replaced! We ate in the restaurants 2 nights, great food but slow service, however whilst waiting the staff were happy to provide more breads. computers available to print out boarding passes. Lovely downstairs rest rooms.  Overall a great stay in a lovely modern, friendly hotel & would definitely revisit if we were to go to dublin again!",5,2015,04,11
211,Croke park hotel absolutely beautiful,We where welcomed by Philip who is the best receptionist and friendliest I have ever met he greeted us and made my 3 children feel very special and welcome he offered us over and above what his job required I will definitely be going to stay there again,5,2015,04,11
211,"Fantastic, as usual.","I cannot praise this hotel enough. The staff are amazing, rooms are comfortable, food is incredible. It's the only place I stay when I visit Dublin. I can't wait to get back there!

If you're looking for a hotel that is a home away from home, this is it. 
              ",5,2015,04,11
211,Absolutely fine and good value,"Selected the hotel based on the excellent TripAdvisor reviews and in particular the positive comments about the hotel staff and I have to agree on this point.  We had a spacious double room for the four of us which was fine for our one night stay in Dublin.  Weather was perfect for the 15 minute walk into town but we did make use of taxis for Grafton Street or Temple Bar area.  Buffet breakfast was fine; standard fare, nothing special but it part of the excellent value all inclusive rate for the room.  Prefered this to the previous Dublin hotel I stayed in when I last visited Dublin for rugby weekend.",3,2015,04,10
211,"Modern, comfortable, friendly, nice food","We stayed here 3 nights over the Easter weekend. It was a great base to explore Dublin from, with really friendly helpful staff who were very helpful and put themselves out for us. So when we got back in after 10.00 one night, with the kitchen officially closed, they were still happy to rustle some food up. We ate in each night we were there, as we got back late from the theatre and a gallery opening. There was a nice buzz in the bistro/bar, and the food was good value and good quality. The rooms are modern and comfortable. As we left they gave us each a bottle of water for our journey - a standard thing they do which is a nice touch. We'd stay there again, and will always have happy memories of our Good Friday night in the bar.",4,2015,04,10
211,"Clean, comfortable, 12 min walk to O'Connell street","I won my trip to Dublin and got to choose this hotel as my accomodation (therefore I cannot say anything about the price-performance ratio). The hotel staff is very friendly, the service good (there was a mixup with the cocktail I had ordered and I immediately got a new one after pointing out the mistake). The breakfast is excellent.

The hotel seems to be quite charming considering the not-so-appealing location (right across Croke Park Stadium and next to railway tracks...). The only real point of criticism I have is that (at least in our room) the hotel (bed)room didn't have enough lighting options.... it got really dark in the room even with all standard lamps turned on. The bathroom offers good light, however, I would have appreciated a  vanity mirror.

We decided to walk to ""downtown"", i.e., O'Connell Street - it took us roughly 12 minutes one way. You can also take bus 7 but you sometimes have to wait for it for a very long time... the friendly Concierge at the Croke Park Hotel will surely help you as he did us!

Altogether: I would definitely revisit the Croke Park Hotel.",4,2015,04,09
211,Excellent stay,"I have had a wonderful stay at this hotel, it's worth it to pay extra for the deluxe room worth every penny.All the staff make you feel like Roalty. Food in the hotel is first class. Rooms lovely. Comfy beds. All staff need to be rewarded as they go out of their way to make you have an enjoyable break. Courtesy bus stops at the hotel for people wanting to go on the HOP N OFF bus tour from the city centre. I would definetly stay at a Doyle hotel again. Thanks for my enjoyable stay at the Croke park hotel.",5,2015,04,08
211,Beautiful hotel - loved it!!!,"Stayed one night as we were going to Dublin zoo for child's birthday. 

The hotel look and feel is one of modern sophistication. Staff were very friendly and attentive, young son received a teddy bear when we checked in at reception!! Very quickly made us feel at home. 

Rooms clean, fresh and all facilites working way they should! Beds were so comfortable and fitted the whole family! 

Dinner in the restaurant was great. Quiet and relaxing family time, plus some toys for the little one to keep him occupied. 

Parking under the hotel and ticket validation on exit. 

I couldn't fault anything during our short stay and definitely plan to return!!",5,2015,04,08
211,Lovely 2 night stay!!,"We stayed in the Crowe Park in Dublin on the 30th of March. The hotel is in a really good location only a 15 minute walk in to the town centre which was really good and cost around 20 euros to the airport which again we felt was really good.

On arrival to the hotel the receptionist who checked us in at first could not find us on the system which meant we was stood waiting for 5/10 minutes however this issue was quickly resolved and we were able to store our bags as we were too early for check-in.

The room was fantastic. It was very clean, the housekeepers do a great job and the turndown service was at an excellent standard. We had access to the executive lounge during our stay, it was a luxurious relaxing room which had complimentary water, tea/coffee and juice so I would definitely recommend upgrading to have this luxury.

We sat and had meals both evenings in the side-line bar bistro both evenings. The food was excellent however the only let down was the staff were not attentive enough and we were left over half an hour at times waiting to order a drink or waiting for the bill which I felt was quite disappointing.

Apart from a few minor issues we thourally enjoyed our stay at the Crowe park and would definitely return again!!!",4,2015,04,08
211,"Beautiful hotel, great Irish breakfast, but noisy recycling or something at 3:30 a.m.","This is a very nice hotel directly across the street from Croke Park. The beds were comfortable, the breakfast food was excellent and the staff were nice and helpful. I don't know if Monday is their trash pick-up day or what, but my roommate and I were woken up somewhere between 3:00 and 3:30 a.m. by loud trucks, scraping noises, and crashing and banging. It lasted for over 2 hours and we had to be up at 6:30. Not sure if it was from Croke Park or the hotel or the entire street, but it sounded like a huge recycling center or auto dismantling business! Hopefully, it was just a one time thing or it's only on Monday mornings. I cannot give a 5 rating just because it was impossible to sleep through the racket. I would love to try the hotel again on another night :)",4,2015,04,08
211,Terrific hotel!,"We came to this hotel for their one night family Easter break. By end of our stay we were wishing we could have stayed longer! Our room was very clean & comfortable, great to have separate bath & shower! Staff were extremely polite & friendly. Andrea in the restaurant was very helpful. Staff at reception were again so helpful & pleased our kids by giving them a smoothie while we waited for our room to be ready. All in all we really enjoyed our stay- thanks!",5,2015,04,07
211,The most attentive hotel!!,"From making our reservation to checking out, our expectations were blown away. I had booked the Croke Park Hotel as a surprise for my fiancé for his 30th Birthday along with parent in laws. Sarah one of the reservation agents mentioned about the possibility of a room upgrade which was great, but what we had in actual fact was the most attentive treatment I/we have ever experienced, we were upgraded to the Executive floor, had lots of other delightful and unexpected gifts, complimentary drinks, turn down service etc we stayed over the Easter weekend & received an Easter Bunny which replaced the turn down pillow chocolate! The hotel is in a great location 10mins walk to Temple Bar and the main hustle & bustle. We didn’t get chance to eat at the Hotel, but did catch a glimpse whilst enjoying our complimentary drinks at the Bar, it looked delicious! We all could not praise the excellence of the Croke Park Hotel enough, thank you for making our weekend & Jon’s weekend a remember able one. We are already looking at when we plan to come back.  ",5,2015,04,07
211,Perfect,Loved this place.  Just outside of downtown and a 10-15 minute easy walk.  Staff very kind and helpful.  Price for the nice accommodations (comfortable and large room) is perfect.  Also loved being across from stadium.  Top of the list and slainte!  Would definitely recommend.  ,5,2015,04,06
211,Some what OK,My sister treated us at Christmas to an Easter break at the Croke Park Hotel on arriving at the Airport my partner and I got a taxi to the hotel as we didn't know which buses to take. The taxi cost us €33 compared to the €15 people have been saying recently. On arrival to the hotel we where met by the receptionist who was ever so helpful. We received a room straight away. The room itself was ok nothing to really shout about I checked my sisters booking the second day we where there and she had booked us a superia double and we had obviously been given a family room which was disappointing!!! The breakfast on our first day seemed a little rushed and we where missing things off our table when we were seated. The walk in to the city takes around 10-15 minutes we had a meal in the restaurant on the second night and our waitress was brilliant Andrea I believe her name was the food was ok nothing I would really shout about. The breakfast on the second day was a lot better and seemed much more organised. We have decided we will be staying next year with a couple of our friends,3,2015,04,06
211,Excellent Hotel - 5* Experience!,"My parents and I stayed at The Croke Park Hotel for 2 nights in April 2015. The staff, service, room, value, location and food were faultless! We would highly recommend this hotel to others. One of the best hotels we have every stayed at. The little touches in the hotel really made a big difference - e.g. the Executive Lounge on the fourth floor which had complimentary drinks and snacks, the speediness of the cleaners, a little card with the weather report for the following day left in the room, and yummy chocolates placed on our pillows of an evening. A very special stay at a fantastic price. You will not be disappointed!",5,2015,04,06
211,Beyond our expectations! Book the tour bus!,"A lovely, modern and comfortable hotel. It was busy when we arrived because of a rugby tournament but the staff checked us in quickly and we're very friendly and chatty. The room was bigger than expected especially the bathroom! The bed was very comfortable and provided extra pillows as per request.If you are stuck for food, do go to the restaurant downstairs. Good value for money for the portions you get. I would also definitely recommend buying a 2 day pass for the hop on hop off bus that goes around Dublin. We had ours from the concierge by the front desk. The shuttle bus picks you up right outside the hotel and takes you right to the centre of O'connell street and then you just catch the green tour bus around Dublin. We were very greatful to find this service as we didn't have time to do everything but saw mostly everything we wanted to see as we travelled on the bus! The only downfall is that the last shuttle bus back to the hotels as at 4 so if you wanted to stay past 4 it was a taxi back to the hotel. We walked back one day though and we were please try surprised how easy of a walk it actually is, about 20 if not 15 minutes! Overall a great great stay for our first time in Dublin and will definitely recommend to anyone!",5,2015,04,06
211,Amazing service!,A fantastic stay in this great hotel. Nothing too much trouble for any of the staff we met. The hotel was spotlessly clean. Food in the restaurant was excellent. Only a short walk into Dublin centre. Cannot fault the hotel at all.,5,2015,04,04
211,Top quality ,"Me and my partner stayed here for a weekend at the end of March. We had stated to the hotel it was a celebration and we was given a gift which was very nice. From the moment we walked in the hotel we was made to feel like royalty. Nothing was too much for the staff!! Food was amazing and the bar was also very good. City centre is only a short 10 min walk.
Great hotel!! ",5,2015,04,03

211,Great Hotel!,"I stayed at The Croke Park Hotel for two days in March, 2015.  The hotel was lovely, and the rooms were very nice.  Comfortable beds, nice view of Croke Park, and a great, spacious bathroom with a tub and shower.  The ice machine had a few options for either ice or water and ice...it was awesome!  The price I booked the room at was extremely reasonable especially since this seems like a 4 star property.  I really enjoyed my stay and recommend you check out The Croke Park Hotel next time you visit Dublin. ",4,2015,04,02
211,Relaxed stay,"We stayed for one nice and got a room on the first floor with a small balcony facing Croke Park Stadium. The room was a good size, a very comfortable bed and a good size bath in the bathroom. The mini fridge didn't seem to open and you need a staff member to come up to the room and open the balcony door for you as there is no key left in the door.
I liked the bar area, relaxed good bar food. Breakfast was good also.",4,2015,04,02
211,Fantastic Hotel & Staff!,"This hotel was excellent, I just got back on the 31st of March and miss Dublin very much. The Hotel was about 15 mins walk away from the city centre. The room was wonderfuly clean and very tidy and spacious. The restaurant was wonderful, all the servers were lovely happy to help people as were the hotel staff. The concierge really helped us find our way about and before we left, when our case lock froze up we were in a panick as our passports were in there, he took care of it immediatley! We were offered bottles of water before we head out for the day also which was lovely, the staff are just on the ball all the time.  I don't think I could have been happier with everybody and the standard of the hotel! (The decor is lovely too, really modern but very comforting) Thankyou!",5,2015,04,01
211,Fantastic hotel,"This was my first time staying here and I will definitely be back. The hotel is fabulous, staff are incredible and the food is wonderful. It is evident that the staff are happy working here and nothing is too much ask. The free secure parking Is a pleasant bonus.",5,2015,03,30
211,Outstandingly Excellent ,"Fantastic! This is a really nice hotel, with really nice rooms, and really nice bathrooms. What sets it apart from other nice hotels is the quality of the staff they employ. I saw nothing but genuine smiles during the entire time we were there. Nothing was too much trouble, and the staff genuinely want you to enjoy your time in the hotel. The best thing about the place is that it's a 'posh' hotel with 'homely' staff, an exceptionally rare combination, and one to be very highly commended. 
A very special mention of thanks for two staff members that really caught our attention, Orla on the front desk, and Aisilin from the waiting staff. These 2 went out of their way to ensure our sons dietry requirements were met. Our 3yr old son immediately fell in love with Aisilins charm and it was quite difficult trying to keep him held back during meals when he saw her! 
We loved everything about the hotel and would not only stay again in a heartbeat, but would happily recommend it to others. We will definitely stay here again on future visits to Dublin. 
",5,2015,03,29
211,Best hotel stay ever by far!!,"Myself and my wife stayed in this hotel for one night as we were attending the Lord of the Dance show in the 3arena and 'WOW' what a great hotel to stay in - the staff were exceptionally nice and helpful and made our time there feel like home!!. 
The food we had both dinner and breakfast was fabulous, quality food and plenty of it - great place to eat that's for sure !!.  We have stayed in a fair share of hotels in out time and this one rates above all the best for quality of food, friendliness of staff and value for money.
We will definitely be back!!!.",5,2015,03,29
211,Much needed vacation,"We spent 3 nights at the Croke Park hotel the staff was fantastic.  We were able to check in very early in the AM after travelling all night.  

The staff really makes this place great.  We had expressed an interest in seeing the Guinness store house and when we came down to get a cab Ana at the front desk had tickets to Guinness waiting for us.  The food at the sideline bistro was great and the staff in the pub were terrific as well.",5,2015,03,27
211,Staff was exceptional!,"Stayed in this hotel for our anniversary trip from 3/18-3/23 (Room 240).  We received an email prior to check in to ask us our preferences.  We mentioned that it was our anniversary and they delivered champagne to help us celebrate!  Our room was very quiet which we wanted.  The rooms were adequately sized and housekeeping was excellent.  The rooms were spotless and I am picky about cleanliness.  There was plenty of drawer space and hanging space for clothes, iron, ironing board, trouser press, hairdryer, and a pot to make hot water (I don't know what that is called), coffee, tea and free wifi.  There was a slot where we had to put a key card in by the door in order to keep the lights on...or they would turn off by timer.  I have never seen that before...we figured it out eventually, but it might be good to mention it.  The only things I would change about our room is the pillows and the view.  The pillows were a bit flat, but there were four in the room (king size...bed a bit firm too) and the view (which I realize cannot be changed) was of a giant dumpster full of bathtubs, mattresses, etc in an industrial lot...not exactly romantic.  I am sure they were quieter than the front of the hotel but next time I would request a stadium view...may not be romantic, but it wouldn't be a dumpster.
The best part about this hotel is by far the staff!  Everyone we encountered was friendly, professional, helpful, and went above and beyond our expectations.  The front desk staff was courteous offered a warm towel upon arrival and since we had been stuck in an airport or an airplane for 18 hours, that was a very welcome touch.  They called taxis for us several times always with a smile and offered bottled water when we checked out.  Housekeeping did a very good job keeping the hotel spotless.  They were doing some touch up painting and such in the lobby and always had a sign up to excuse their work.  The concierge was awesome.  They held our bags as we arrived before check in, helped us book tours and dinners, gave us suggestions, instructed us in mass transit options, pointed out attractions on our map, etc. and overall made us feel important and genuinely wanted to make sure we had a good time.  
We ate at the bar on our first night.  The restaurant did not open until 6, but because our internal clocks were off and we were starving at 5, they directed us to the bar area and said we could have food and drinks there.  The hotel and bar area are beautifully decorated.  The bar has a really cool fire feature and big screen tv.  The waiter had forgotten part of my order, and when I asked again, he sincerely apologized and brought it immediately and apologized again.  We ordered room service one morning for breakfast and the gentleman was polite and answered some questions we had in regards to his favorite parts of Dublin.
The hotel was a ways from city center, but we liked it that way.  We heard others complaining how noisy their city center hotels were and frankly it would have cost us way more than the 8 euro taxi ride every day.  ($400 more per person for a comparable city center hotel when booked with flight).  20 euros taxi ride from the airport, shuttles to the hop on/hop off bus tour start several times per morning, and around the corner from a city bus stop, close to the DART rail too.  30 minute walk to city center.
But seriously...the BEST part of this hotel are the people working in it...Thanks for a great trip!!",4,2015,03,26
211,Beautiful rooms with large bathrooms!,So please with everything about this hotel. The rooms were very nice and spacious with very large bathrooms. The restaurant has great food and AMAZING coffee. Its a little far from the shopping and restaurants in the temple area about a 10 euro cab ride and a half hour walk but well worth the time and money. Would stay there again in a heartbeat.,4,2015,03,26
211,Excellent hotel,One of the best hotels we saw close to downtown. Very nice. Clean. Huge bathroom. Lots of space. Enjoyed every moment. Accommodations were excellent. Very modern and easy free parking. Close walking distance from downtown. Surrounded by restaurants.,5,2015,03,26
211,Terrific,"Lovely hotel can'tpraise staff enough from reception to housekeeping, rooms spacious,high standard from housekeeping, very close to city centre and across the road from Croke park stadium.Tour bus picks up from hotel,food in bar very good,would reommend it gladly.will be returning to this hotel in the near future.We had a wonderful stay, book with confidence.",5,2015,03,26
211,Gorgeous hotel,"Just arrived back from 3 night stay at this hospital. Very impressed- staff were very helpful and friendly. The hotel was spotless; with lovely The White Company shower gel/ shampoo and conditioner replenished everyday. Lovely spacious air conditioned rooms. didn't pay for breakfast which was about 12 euros but the hotel also do smaller meals which are reasonable and very tasty.
Can't say enough positive things about this hotel! Amazing!!",5,2015,03,26
211,F-A-B-U-L-O-U-S,From the moment we arrived late on Saturdy afternoon to when we left mid morning on Monday we were spoiled. Our room was large and airy and the decor was very tasteful. There were fluffy dressing gowns and slippers and we had a turndown service with complimentary Bulers chocolates. The little extra touches helped to make it an enjoyable experience. The staff were very attentive and could not have done more. We had dinner on Saturday night and the food was excellent. We were even offered bottled water for our journey home.,5,2015,03,25
211,"Great stay, very very nice hotel","All the staff were so friendly , very professional and I as a hotel visitor couldl not find any faults whatsoever. Top marks to all the staff , really really nice helpful people.
              The hotel was so clean , as were the bedrooms, food was also up to a great standard
              
              ",5,2015,03,25
211,"Nice Hotel, but just that.","Having read the reviews on this hotel I was expecting something quite special.
It's not, nor can I see quite how it's the 2nd best hotel in Dublin.
Don't get me wrong, it's a 4 star hotel. 
The staff were very good, friendly and efficient.
The rooms are ok, standard double size bed. Shower wasn't very powerful. The room isn't far off needing refreshing, you even get a CD player, probably showing the last time the rooms were refurbed.
We had both the breakfast buffet, and breakfast in bed. Both were ok, although the poached eggs were solid.
Location would be great if you were to be going to the stadium over the road.",4,2015,03,24
211,Great value and service,"We stayed here 2 nights and the hotel was great, it was a bit tricky to find initially (although being across from the huge stadium helps with directions!).  We arrived early from an international flight and out room was ready early, we were able to settle in and get a quick nap before heading out for the day.  It's a 15-20 minute walk to city center, or just a short cab ride, we found this worked well for us to get dropped off and picked up when we needed.  Breakfast was delicious, beds were very comfortable and was overall a great stay.  

The hotel is larger and modern, it had a Marriott feel to it and is a very comfortable hotel with spacious rooms and free parking as well.",5,2015,03,24
211,Fantastic Hotel,We were absolutely delighted by our stay at The Croke Park Hotel. Our room was spacious and spotless. The room was serviced daily and the provisions in the room were well above average. We'd definitely stay here again and recommend it to our friends.,5,2015,03,23
211,First Class,"Great food, we ate all meals in the hotel during our 2 night stay - very generous portions. Watched the 3 super Saturday 6 nation games in the bar, huge screen & very comfortable setting. Every staff member was so pleasant. Hotel has a relaxed vibe. I walked from Connolly station to the hotel. Was a bit too far - nearly 30 mins. Taxi returning to airport was €20 from the hotel. ",5,2015,03,23
211,Great hotel,"Another great stay for a couple of nights as a group.  Rooms are excellent, beds comfortable, bathroom good. Fantastic breakfast - sets you up for the whole day. About 15min walk into town, taxi back isn't expensive. Staff great. Will be back.  Just wish it had a pool.........!",4,2015,03,23
211,Another great stay at the Croke Park Hotel,"This is my hotel of choice when staying in Dublin.  Have never had a bad experience here.  Staff are amazing, nothing is too much trouble and always so friendly & helpful.  
We stayed in a room on the 4th floor with access to the Executive Suite (with complimentary 24hour tea/coffee, juice, water, biscuits, fruit, newspapers, magazines). The room was huge - large double bed and a single bed and they were sooo comfy, had a great nights sleep with no noise problems.  The room had absolutely everything - tv, kettle, iron, trousers press, safe, hairdryer, ipod docking station, fridge, minibar, bathrobes, slippers, complimentary chocolates.  The toiletries were plentiful & fabulous quality. Bathroom was huge with separate bath and large shower.  Plenty of room for keeping your make-up etc.
We ate in the Sideline Bar - food was fresh and cooked well. Try the berry mojitos - best we've ever had.  Nice atmosphere in the bar too, 
We were attending a concert in the Three Arena & the taxi cost approx €11 or €12 each way.
We filled out the form to have breakfast to our room the next morning (something I'm normally very wary of).  Food arrive at 10.15 a.m. (we had chosen between 10.00 -10.30am), the waitor was really friendly and helpful and made sure we had everything we ordered. The cooked breakfast was piping hot and the poached eggs were the best I have ever had - really set us up for the day. 
If you're bringing the car, there is a secure underground carpark at the hotel which is free for hotel guests. 
All in all - another fab stay. Looking forward to the next visit.     ",5,2015,03,23
211,Great guest service,"What impressed me the most about the Croke Park Hotel was the level of detail they pay both to the hotel and to guests.  I checked in on a day when there was a match in the stadium across the street.  They had sent me email saying that they expected the hotel restaurant to be full that day and the roads around the stadium closed by the police, so I was not surprised in check-in that there were a lot of people milling about the lobby.  None-the-less, while I was checking in, the manager Catherine came out, introduced herself to me and explained that they hotel was typically not like that and not to be alarmed.  I thought that this was a very classy thing to do on her part, and in truth, from my room on the second floor, I did not hear any noise at all.
Additionally, one can see the careful attention given to little things, like chairs in the lobby constantly being straightened, and the excellent service given by the concierges when one would ask directions.

The hotel is only about a 5 minute walk from the Drumcondra bus stop with direct lines to the airport - I was in the airport in less than 30 minutes from the time I left the hotel lobby on my return.  It is though a bit of a walk to the center as others have commented.

The room was nice and modern. A shaving mirror in the bathroom for those of us who cannot see well enough without glasses would have been nice, but this is of course a minor thing.

My recommendation though would be to have some variance in the breakfast menu.  While the breakfast was nice, the menu did not change in the 4 days that I was there.  It would have been nice to have had oatmeal, for example, offered on at least one of the days.

 All in all, a very nice experience and I would recommended the Croke Park",5,2015,03,23
211,lovely hotel,"Stayed overnight in the hotel the night before a conference in croke park. The next morning we literally had to roll out of bed and walk across the street which was great. (Might have done a little too much ""networking"" the night before in the lovely bar :) )The staff were really friendly and helpful. The food in the restaurant down stairs was lovely and service really good. The beds were really comfortable and the bathroom was HUGE! Which was brillant as there were 3 of us, all girls staying in the room that night. Breakfast the next morning was lovely as well. It was a very short stay I'm afraid but the next time im in dublin I hope to stay a litle longer.",5,2015,03,21
211,super hotel,"modern decor, friendly proffessional staff, about 1 mile way from city centre, cab ride about 10 euros,  good price value, i recommend reserving thru their website, u can reserve and pay at chekout!  Even though its in front of stadium,, its got good soundproof. I really enjoyed my stay here.",5,2015,03,20
211,Lovely hotel,"Would recommend this hotel if travelling to Dublin. 
It is about a 15 minute walk to the centre so take your umbrella if it is raining. 
The hotel is quiet, clean and spacious, with friendly staff. 
We had room service 1 night which was reasonably priced and good value. ",4,2015,03,19
211,Fantastic value for money!,Great welcome and got accommodated on the 4th floor which has access to the executive lounge. Great atmosphere on the Saturday night from the Crooke Park stadium and an easy 5-10 minute walk into the town centre. Cannot fault this hotel at all and would definitely stop here again.,5,2015,03,19
211,Excellent and welcoming.,"Again we had a lovely welcome when we arrived at hotel, immediately given keys to a room.  Room was bright, well equipped and with a modern bathroom. Linen and towels were immaculate as was the bed linen.  The tea and coffee maker was a Godsend after a long journey. I cannot praise the staff enough, nothing was too much trouble. We had a lovely time over the St Patrick's holidays.",5,2015,03,19
211,Excellent Stay,"We were in Dublin the weekend prior to St Patrick's Day and simply chose this hotel through value for money. 
The hotel is excellent, so clean and staff so helpful. 
We arrived at 9am which the room was not ready and there was no issue checking in around 11pm after a few Guinness'.

Parking is free and the facilities are excellent. Location wise it is around 15 minutes into Dunlin at a standard pace.",5,2015,03,19
211,Good enjoyable stay,"Nice large clean room in good condition. Easy check in with nice staff member. Didnt have the breakfast slept in. Had a couple of drinks in the bar, a little quiet that night. Over all an enjoyable stay in a good clean room for a reasonable price. A taxi to the centre does cost around ten euro way. ",4,2015,03,18
211,Nothing spectacular but very good,"We decided on this location due to price and free parking. Its about a 10 minute walk to O'Connell st which is great but if you don't like a lot of walking you might want to get a closer in hotel. The staff was great and had emailed me prior and when I let them know that we were coming for my mum's birthday there were two mini ""champagne"" bottles and a card for here which was great. The customer service was great but the hotel itself was just average. Obviously if you're interested in the events at Croke Park itself this is a perfect location. 

I had one meal at the hotel it was a toasted ham and cheese with chips and salad for 7 euro which wasn't bad compared to the rest of the menu!",4,2015,03,18
211,Couldn't have asked for more,"Very recently stayed at this hotel for a weekend break. The hotel was only a short journey from the airport and is an easy walk away from town centre. The hotel itself was clean and modern, with an extra edge in style. The bedroom was well sized and comfortable and the bathroom was spacious. The food was also great in both taste and portion size. What really made it for me though, was their brilliant staff. They really did everything to assist us and were genuinely happy to help. My friend and I were unlucky enough to have our phones stolen during a night out in Temple Bar, and the staff back at the hotel were so brilliant with us, helping us to calm down, call the police, block our phones and even call our phone carriers back in England. So I would really like to say a big, special thank you to the receptionist and guard on duty in the early morning of the 16th March; you're quick thinking and calm attitudes really helped lessen the stressful situation.",5,2015,03,18
211,Quality of service.,"We have stayed again at the Croke Park Hotel and I have to say the quality of service from all the staff is a credit to the Management and a pleasure for the guests at the receiving end, this goes from reception right throughout the hotel including your attentive bar staff and room maids.
The quality of the food served from breakfast and evening meal are really hard to beat, you might pay a little more for everything in the hotel but it is worth every cent and if you consider the secure free parking then costs are about the same as other close hotel but sadly they cannot match the quality of the Croke Park Hotel in any way.",5,2015,03,17
211,Great hotel,"Stayed here for a long weekend with my partner and could not fault it in the slightest, we arrived around 9am as we had an early flight and upon reaching the hotel (20 mins by bus from the airport) the lady behind the desk offered us the room straight away as nobody was in there last night so we cautiously asked how much it would cost for early check in and there wasn't any. Brilliant service. There is the roof top tour bus that stops straight infront of the hotel which is perfect for those who want to have a look around this beautiful city. The beds were comfy the room was spacious and cleaned daily to a very high standard. The restaurant is a bit pricey but so is the rest of Dublin so can't grumble too much. All in all a perfect hotel for any occasion.",5,2015,03,17
211,Fantastic hotel!,"The hotel itself is lovely, clean and modern with fantastic and helpful staff. The bar in the hotel is cheaper than the bars in Dublin which is rare for a hotel and the cocktails and food in the bar are gorgeous. We flew over on a Friday evening after work so just stayed in the hotel on the Friday night as we arrived around 9:30. The hotel is about 15 mins walk from the Spire in Dublin centre so fine for through the day to walk in and out of town, and about 10 euros into town on a night when your in your heels!  The staff are so friendly and gave us advice on where to drink/directions etc and where very quick at bringing up extra towels and tea/milk etc when we asked for it. Great hotel, would definitely go again.",5,2015,03,16
211,Second time staying there and will go back again,"Lovely place to stay,... extremely friendly staff who go out of their way to ensure you get the best out of your stay. This was out second visit and all in all we were extremely satisfied with everything. Location, breakfast, a nice big bathroom. We were a group of 8 people and all of us would come back again.",4,2015,03,16
211,Great hotel and great staff,"I stayed here recently while dealing with a family illness at a nearby hospital(Mater).  
 The front desk staff and manager (Catherine) were the best.  They could not have been more accommodating or helpful  allowing us to extend our stayed as needed. The room was large,very clean and well serviced daily.  Good wifi connection and a nice lounge/bar area to sit and relax or have a bite to eat. Both bar and restaurant prices were very reasonable and the included buffet breakfast had everything you could want, a great selection of both traditional fry items as well as cereal fruit and cold cuts.
Overall a great stay and extremely helpful staff. Free car prkign or taxi to city center is about 10euro",5,2015,03,16
211,Can't really beat the price,"I stayed at this hotel (beautiful by the way) for less than $90 a night, which I thought was too good to be true. It's about a 15-20 minute walk to City Center Dublin which can be tiring, but you can always take the Dublin City Bus (40, 16 stop nearby). It's really annoying that there isn't a bus stop closer to the hotel considering that the croke park stadium is LITERALLY across the street.

The customer service was superb, all you can ask for. Very patient and friendly staff all around. 

Aside from the walk to City Center, my only grievances are the lack of outlets in the bathroom. There was only one outlet for ""shavers."" I have braces so not being able to use my waterpik meant I got to spend 30-40 mins flossing my teeth and appliances. That was awful. Lastly, the beds and pillows might be the worst I've encountered in terms of comfort. Our bed was rock hard and the pillows caved in with any weight. This translated to no relief for our backs after long days of sightseeing. It took two nights back in the states to get my back back to a happy place.

I would recommend, maybe just buy an egg crate or pillow unless you like super firm beds and flat pillows.",4,2015,03,16
211,Wonderful Hotel and Service,"Has been a while since I got to stay here and the return visit I was very impressed.  It was just a flying visit but the warm welcome you get at reception is just super and friendly.  Staff very helpful.

Was rushing out that evening so did not have time for food.  Room was very clean and had all you need.  Bed was very comfortable.

Will be back here again.",5,2015,03,16
211,Great value and experience,"From the minute we walked in, we were made to feel welcome.  Very accommodating and helpful. I had a cold and the front desk person sent me to the bar to ask them to make me the ""I have a cold"" tea and it was perfect! Exactly what I needed and I think it really helped.  The bathroom was lovely and I took a bubble bath in the great bathtub every day.  The bar is a cool place to hang out and unwind at the end of the day and the staff is friendly.  Breakfast is great.  Get it included in your stay because I regretted not doing that.  The concierge was wonderful, helping us with a day trip and giving us all the information we needed for public transportation and shopping.  I highly recommend the Croke Park Hotel.  ",5,2015,03,15
211,Wonderful spacious rooms and amazingly helpful staff,"My wife and I spent three days at the Croke Park on a city break. It is very spacious - big foyer, lounge area, restaurant, library, etc., and the bedroom was large and comfortable - with an enormous bed, nice furniture and the usual amenities (safe, mini-bar, TV, free wi-fi, CD player, etc.).  We had a couple of room service meals, and they were both excellent. The staff are absolutely terrific. My wife was unwell during our visit, and the staff could not have been kinder or more helpful.
I'm really puzzled by a recent review which says ""This is a basic hotel, don't expect any luxuries"". I have stayed in hotels all over the world and of all types - including luxury ones like Gleneagles - and no way would I describe this as a 'basic hotel'. (Believe me, I've stayed in some of them).
The only negative, I guess, might be the location. We were taking taxis all the time to get to the centre. They would usually cost about 7 or 8 euros (in practice 10 with a tip) and this would mount up if you were staying for long.
And a final, very important, note of caution. The minbar is computerised - if you lift any item item to look at it, it is instantly charged to your account. So make sure you read the instructions inside.",5,2015,03,15
211,"Decent, Practical","This is a basic hotel, don't expect any luxuries but it is clean and central enough, with nice staff and nice service; it's somewhere decent to sleep and have breakfast in the morning! 
I honestly couldn't find any faults, and I look pretty intently for faults. The one thing I can say is that the decor was in need of upgrading. Besides that, for a non-romantic non-luxury stay, it does the job. 
The breakfast in the morning was the best part; the buffet had great options. The staff were nice, as an example, we had to leave early one morning before the buffet opened, so they packed us breakfast and went out of their way to get us coffee. Nice, no? We found that most Irish are helpful and nice in general.

Final words? Stay here if you are looking for a basic, clean, comfortable place.",4,2015,03,14
211,Perfect,My fiancé and I stayed for my 30th birthday and we experienced 5* service everyday. When the cleaning team saw a card out I was wished a happy birthday from all the staff (little card) the room was always immaculate the restaurant was lovely and the executive lounge was very well kept. The service we received at the front desk was great. Recommend to anyone! ,5,2015,03,13
211,The place to stay for a big GAA game,"The Croke Park is a great hotel located right across the road from Croke Park Stadium and I had a great view of the stadium from my room. The hotel is spotless and the staff are extremely friendly and helpful. Parking and wifi are important to me when staying in hotels. I was delighted there were plenty of spaces in the free car park and the wifi (also free) was excellent throughout the hotel. When there is a big game in Croke Park, the buzz about the hotel is fantastic.",5,2015,03,13
211,Love this hotel,"My husband and I have just returned from a great weekend in Dublin staying in the Croke Park Hotel. This was our fifth visit and it didn't disappoint. We had a lovely room on the fourth floor and as usual the full Irish breakfast was super. We had a gorgeous meal on the Saturday evening in the Bistro and enjoyed the craic in a very vibrant atmosphere in the bar afterwards. The staff are friendly and accommodating and from the hotel it is an easy walk to O'Connell Street. 
Many thanks to Sean Reid for the great deal. We will be in touch again for sure!

Maire Gallagher",5,2015,03,11
211,Can't fault it - excellent,"Stayed over a weekend while visiting friends in Dublin.
The hotel, as you might imagine, is literally across the road from Croke Park. It was about 20euro in a taxi from the airport and about 10 into the city centre.
The reception area, bar and dining room are all very modern, clean and welcoming (bar has a huge TV for watching sport - our friends told us the bar is buzzing on match days with live bands outside too).
We got a room upgrade to a suite which was a lovely treat. As well as a huge bedroom, we also had a dining table, seating area, desk and nespresso machine! Lovely White Company toiletries in the bathroom.
Breakfast was nice with a huge selection of continental and hot food. 
Our hotel deal included free entry into the Guinness factory, one taxi ride into the city centre, a cocktail of the day each and 20% off bistro food bill. Fabulous value for money in a fabulous hotel. Will always try to stay here from now on when we visit Dublin.",5,2015,03,11
211,First Class Hotel,"One of the best hotels we have stayed in.
Amazing deluxe room with very comfortable super king size bed, spacious bathroom with walk in shower & full size bath.
The hotel breakfast was first class with lots of choice from the Full Irish to Continental.
Overall cleanliness of the hotel was of very high standard.
The hotel is about a 20 min walk into the city centre, although the Hop On Hop Off bus is available from the hotel & we recommend the City Tour Bus as a great way to see the sights.
We would recommend this hotel to anyone spending time in Dublin.
 
Hotel staff were very helpful & nothing was too much trouble.",5,2015,03,10
211,Well worth the money,"Myself and my girlfriend stayed this weekend, and had an excellent experience, cleanliness off the hotel was off a high standard, staff were very helpful, and is in a great location to the town centre, will definately be returning",5,2015,03,09
211,Fabulous,"Stayed in this hotel over the weekend with my husband and two sons had a fabulous time, staff and food were great . The hospitality was second to none couldn't do enough for you would highly recommend the hotel",5,2015,03,09
211,Six Nations Weekend,"Friendly, helpful staff. Room was very spacious with two extremely comfortable double beds. Full Irish breakfasts excellent, delicious food (especially white pudding!) freshly cooked. Hotel has been built mainly to cater for those attending matches at Croke Park and so is a little way out of the city centre, but its only a 15/20 minute walk to O'Connell Street and Temple Bar. Also about 20 mins from the airport.
Definitely will stay here again",5,2015,03,08
211,satisfied,"We booked into this hotel for to see a match in croke park which is straight across the road so that was truly a great location for us.  This hotel is very nice, reception area is spacious and comfortable.  In nice weather they have a nice area to sit out off the bar area.  The rooms are clean and basic. There was two matches on that day so the hotel bar and reception area was very packed so to book into this hotel for leisure and chilling isnt suitable when there are matches on.",4,2015,03,08
211,Great hotel,"My husband & I stayed here for two nights recently. We were looking for a nice hotel reasonably priced. Part of me felt the price was too good to be true & I was a little nervous after we booked it. But I must say when we arrived I got a pleasant surprise, the hotel itself was lovely, the room was a great size, the staff were extremely helpful & I genuinely couldn't fault the hotel. An added bonus is free parking, when we were looking at other hotels parking was extra. It is a fifteen minute walk from city centre but that didn't bother us & if you weren't up for the walk a taxi is only €6/7 . ",5,2015,03,07
211,Classy and Luxurious but a Little Out of the Way,"This hotel was a real pleasure to visit, although part of that may be down to staying on the top floor, executive area. The room was a little smaller than I would have expected, however it wasn't cramped either. The king sized bed might have confused my perspective and was incredibly comfortable and relaxing. The room facilities were comprehensive and included TV, tea & coffee making, a proper hair-dryer (not one of the wall mounted varieties), a speedy wifi connection and a iron/board. 
The bathroom was lovely, well-lit and spacious, but I feel that the shower isn't quite right. It feels like they ran out of money for a modern shower and just fitted an old gym shower instead. The location of the hotel was also surprisingly inconvenient. It required two buses to get to Phoenix park and a 13 euro taxi on the return, prompting me to ponder how people usually explore Dublin from this area. 
Those small inconveniences aside, I would recommend the hotel. The staff were utterly professional and are a pleasure to interact with. On mentioning that we intended to visit Dublin zoo the receptionist was able to tell us about some of the recent developments, including new animals and offspring!",4,2015,03,07
211,Contemporary hotel with good facilities and nice staff,"All worked well, staff was nice, rooms are functional and fairly new and clean, free internet and car park. Breakfast is also quiet good. Would absolutely come back. Location is not very central but close to my office and convenient enough to walk to the city or take a quick ride on the cab...",4,2015,03,07
211,Great hotel with great staff,"We spent a lovely long weekend here for my 40th birthday.  The hotel doesn't look very special from the outside, but inside it's spacious and tastefully decorated with a sort of calm 70s vibe.  

There was a big rugby match on my birthday, however it didn't spoil our stay.

Our kids were with us, so we had interconnecting rooms which was great.  Beds were really comfy and the hotel was quiet.  All the staff were really friendly, cheerful and customer-focused.

We ate in the bistro for two nights - food was very good.  Breakfast was also nice.

The hotel accidentally double-booked our rooms for the final night - but the hotel apologised and made amends.

We hired a car from the airport - but wished we hadn't - there wasn't really time to make good use of it.  The hotel is not too far from the airport - and it would be easy to get a taxi or bus to the hotel.  There is a free car park though.

If you don't mind a short walk/bus ride into the city centre and you're not too fussed about a nice view, I'd highly recommend this hotel.",4,2015,03,06
211,Weekend at the Rugby,A weekend visit to see the rugby so decided to stay at the Croke Park which was a 15 euro ride to Temple Bar. Great hotel spacious rooms and much better value than the city centre hotels. Not sure about the surrounding area as warned to take taxi? Great atmosphere in the bar and that's what we call a television !!!,4,2015,03,05
211,"fabulous hotel, brilliant staff","My partner and I stayed in this hotel for 2 nights and were extremely satisfied with the service we received during our stay. Upon arrival we were offered hot towels at reception which we thought was thoughtful. The staff were more than pleasant. 

We were very impressed with the style of our hotel room. It was modern and had a mini fridge, air-conditioning and adjustable heat, a huge bed, which was very comfortable, and a large walk in shower in the bathroom, plus a bath, which was all tastefully decorated. 

There was a lovely atmosphere at the bar, and we were given a large bowl of complimentary nuts to accompany our drinks. We had no problems with sleeping, there was little to no disturbances throughout the night, and when we checked out on our last day we were given complimentary bottles of water for the journey home

All in all an extremely pleasant experience. We will definitely be back to this hotel as it also offered a great rate for the 2 nights we stayed,",5,2015,03,05
211,Nice,"This hotel is very comfortable, irish breakfast buffet is good. Staff is excellent very friendly and helpfull. The only drawback for me was location, since it's in front of the soccer stadium it's very solitary and I didn't feel safe walking outside at night.",3,2015,03,05
211,Pleasant & relaxing one night stay,"We stayed for one night at The Croke Park Hotel during our visit to Dublin and couldn't have asked for more. Although not quite central within Dublin it's only a 15/20 minute walk (about a mile) into the centre or a short journey by taxi or car. Brilliant location for watching events at the Croke Park Stadium though as it's literally opposite and all guests get free parking which was one of the main attractions for us as we had rented a car for the weekend.
The rooms themselves were lovely, nice comfortable (superking I believe) bed and large bathroom with very large bath as well, overall very clean and didn't have a bad word to say about the rooms or service as that was excellent too. 
Breakfast was very nice with a large selection of food if you opt for the full Irish and a smaller selection if you go for a continental brekky. 
Great experience all round and would certainly stay there again, personally I'd recommend this hotel if you are visiting Dublin with a car (free secure parking) and/or don't mind being on the edge of central Dublin as opposed to being located right in the middle. Plus it's roughly 15/20 mins drive from the airport as well.",5,2015,03,05
211,a claimed 4* hotel (and price tag) not a 4* service .........,"An acceptable not an exceptional hotel, well situated (a mile+ walk to the city centre - Spire of Dublin).  Stayed 2 nights to attend the 6 Nations Ireland England match at the Aviva Stadium (Landsdowne Road) on 1 March. The food in the Sideline Bistro is limited but very good and the bar delivers in front of a huge TV screen and a large open lounge.  Being next to Croke Park stadium expect a very busy hotel atmosphere if there is any match in the stadium and with that much noise and a long delay in bar service.  The hotel becomes a meeting point for non-residents and overflows due to the number of people/children.  Room was well appointed however, a 2 double bed room was only set up for two people, cups, towels/bathroom, pillows, tea, coffee, milk etc.  Batteries in the TV remote needed changing as it would not turn on/off.  Despite booking three months in advance for 3 people our room was still only prepared for two.  The Reception staff were excellent, all other staff were average and foreign staff in the Bistro, whilst friendly and polite, had insufficient understanding of English language to grasp the nuances of food/drink questions.  There is no pool.  I cannot rate this hotel any better than 'average'.  There may well be better 4* hotels in Dublin if you want a proper 4* service to accompany the price .............. do your research.",3,2015,03,05
211,"Nice hotel, excellent service! :-)","Except for restaurants and bar, I did not have time to enjoy the other facilities, but I can confirm that its food is good, the bar has a cozy atmosphere, and the ambiance is delightful. 
Service in all areas is fantastic.
Rooms are very comfortable and clean. Internet service good in all areas.
If you don't mind to walk, 15 mins to city centre; it is deserted at night, but it was a safe walk, if you prefer pay 8-10 euros for a cab. The hop on-hop off Dublin Sightseeing (green line) has a pick up service at 9:00 am, absolutely convenient. I will stay again at his hotel if I return to Dublin, I enjoyed very much this city and its people. ;-)",5,2015,03,04
211,Very nice.  All of the modern conveniences,"Stayed for four nights in March, 2105.  Hotel is very nice and modern with decent sized rooms as compared to those closer to the city center.  Front desk staff were professional and friendly and will store luggage in the event no early check is is possible.  Location is not central but its about a 20 minute walk to O'Connel St., and frankly I needed the exercise.  Area is quiet unless there's an event going on at the Croke Park Stadium, located across the street.  But even with a game being played during my stay, there were no issues.",4,2015,03,03
211,One night stay March 2015,"We as a couple stayed here first time for a one night stay. Excellent hotel. Across road from Croke Park stadium. Staff in all parts of hotel were very friendly and helpful. 15 min walk to O'Connell Street, city centre. Room was good size and quiet. Spotlessly clean. Separate bath and walk in shower. Large foyer and seating areas. Large bar with huge screen on wall for Sky News and Sports etc. Restaurant was very good. Breakfast was excellent. We were given free access to executive lounge (comfortable room on fourth floor with TV, newspapers, free tea/coffee/juices/water/biscuits/fruit etc.) for duration of stay. Given small warm and moist towels to refresh on arrival at reception. Each of us were given free bottled water at checkout. WiFi throughout the hotel and underground car park was complimentary. Super all round package. Will stay again, definitely.",5,2015,03,03
211,excellent hotel,"I have to say even before my trip started, the service i received was fantastic. Prior to my arrival i received an email asking about my preferences and if i needed a taxi. 

What surprised me was the fact that it was my birthday and while we were there and the hotel sent up a complimentary bottle of champagne, with a card wishing me happy birthday. They truly made us feel welcomed.

The food at the hotel restaurant was fantastic.

If I had to say anything negative about the hotel is its location. The location is about 15 min walk from city centre in the morning its ok but the walk back at night is not very pleasant, the neighborhood is deserted, and so you feel uncomfortable, so at night i would recommend taking a taxi back to the hotel, depending on where you are in city centre it should cost about 8 to 10 euros.

But overall i do recommend the hotel highly, you will receive the service you expect and more.",5,2015,03,02
211,Lovely hotel,"We were in Dublin for a weekend and our stay at Croke Park was fantastic. The hotel is lovely, the rooms are very clean and the staff are very friendly. My only criticism is that they did not re stock our mini bar, however when we mentioned this when checking out, they decided not to charge us for anything we took out of it as an apology! If you want to be in the city centre, this is a little further out. But the hotel itself is lovely.",4,2015,03,02
211,Great hotel,"We stayed here for two nights in October for my Birthday. Swift check in, the room was very clean   and well equipped with slippers, gown, toiletries and kettle. We had use of the executive lounge which had complimentary snacks and drinks. The breakfast was sensational! Lots of choices and well cooked. Wifi worked throughout our stay. 20 minutes walk to the town.",4,2015,02,28
211,Memorable,"We came to Dublin to Celebrate our 25th Wedding Anniversary, We would highly recommend this hotel, The Staff have all been really helpful and friendly, nothing was to much trouble, we will be coming back just not sure when.",5,2015,02,27
211,Great Weekend,"I don't have a lot to add what others have already said. We booked a double room for a short family break in Dublin.  We were warmly greeted, the room was clean and comfortable and the internet access worked well. Bar downstairs was comfortable and OK priced for a hotel. 

Breakfast was a bit expensive although it was free for my 10 year old. Lady at the desk gets a bonus point for having a sense of humour when we said he normally eats enough for 3 and can he have an extra large plate for three.

All the staff from reception to the cleaners were polite and happy to say hello. Can't really say I tested them out a lot as everything was OK

Taxi to airport was about €20 - and its a 15min walk to the city centre through a not great area of town.",5,2015,02,26
211,Lovely overnight stay,"My husband booked us and our 2 year old in for an overnight stay for my 30th birthday. He chose to upgrade our room to include a king size bed, continental breakfast, a complimentary drink each and access to the executive suite, which made our stay even better. Found the staff to be very friendly and professional. Think we have found our hotel for all future trips to Dublin. The only negative I would have would be that upon making the booking the hotel were informed the trip was for a special birthday and I have seen other reviewers writing about complimentary bottles of champagne they had received. Just thought this was a missed opportunity by the hotel to really excel in their customer service. ",5,2015,02,26
211,Excellent!!!,"My husband and I stayed here on a 2 night visit to Dublin.Wow what a great hotel!!!! Every member of staff we encountered were professional,friendly and went out of their way to make our stay memorable . The hotel is sylish,modern and expectably clean.We stayed on the 4th floor in an executive suite.....little added touches like beautiful robes and toiletries from The White Company just added to the experience. Cooked breakfast was to die for and cocktails the previous evening were an experience you must try especially the chilli infused gin.
Overall when we return to Dublin soon we will be returning to this amazing hotel. Thank you to all staff for an amazing stay",5,2015,02,25
211,Boyfriend and baby .. Amazing time,Room lovely and very clean all staff very friendly and extremely helpful close to airport and city centre would defiantly stay again when visiting Dublin had my young daughter 4 months the lounge was lovely and my partner baby and I had dinner delish !,5,2015,02,24
211,3 day deal,"Took advantage of the 3rd night free deal which worked out really well for us. Hotel was warm, clean and everything expected.
The staff were exceptional to be honest and some of the most helpful I've experienced. Free car parking always a plus these days.
Only downside was poor water pressure in our room and breakfast overpriced per head as an extra otherwise highly recommended.",4,2015,02,23
211,Great hotel,"Stayed here midweek for one night, great attentive staff, nice touches Luke the hot towels at reception on check in and bottled water on departure. Rooms were well equipped and comfortable-tv was a little difficult to use. Bed was huge and very comfortable Bathroom was spotless. Ice and water facilities were available close to the room near the lobby.Will definitely stay again.",5,2015,02,23
211,Pleasurable Stay,"The hotel is very comfortable and the food served in The Sideline Bistro was excellent. The size and water pressure of the shower was particularly good. The rroms were large and comfortable, so overall I was very pleased.",4,2015,02,23
211,A perfect weekend,"we chose Crome park as the online reviews were all good and I must say we weren't disappointed. They contacted me prior to my arrival to check if any of my party had any particular needs ,and at this stage they arranged transfers to and from the airport(at a reasonable cost) . Our driver was waiting for us ,was a was a great asset to our drip as he became an invaluable tour guide. Everyone we came into contact with at the hotel were polite ,helpful and friendly . Our party of 8 ate in the hotel restaurant on the first night ,the food was excellent and reasonably priced for 3 courses and wine it averaged out at £45 a head . We also had snacks in the side line bar which were also faultless . Two of us had cause for celebration whilst on our stay and the wine and cards in the room were a lovely touch . If any one reading this is pondering on where to stay in Dublin pick this hotel you will not be disappointed",5,2015,02,23
211,Excellent hotel,"Friendly, welcoming staff.
The room was spacious, clean and very comfortable.
Room service was prompt, affordable and very tasty.
Exceptional value for the price and I would heartily recommend to anyone visiting Dublin.",5,2015,02,22
211,Lovely,"Stayed here last night. Very close to 3 arena, aviva , etc. handy for city also.  Great helpful staff. Lovely touches like hot towels on arrival and bottles of water when checking out. Only fault is we could hear people in adjoining rooms. Great deals on off season from gaa ",4,2015,02,22
211,Great hotel for a weekend break,"We had a great 2 night break here, close enough to walk into town, loved the room on the 4th floor with use of the executive lounge, the breakfast was delicious and the staff were very courteous and helpful.  We had dinner in the restaurant which was delicious. ",5,2015,02,22
211,Excellent service,"Had a short stay for work and this hotel was perfect. The best sleep I have had in ages, so clean and comfortable. The staff are very attentive and were disappointed when I didn't get brilliant service. They recovered the situation in a short time, a sign of a great hotel.",5,2015,02,22
211,Simply amazing! ,"Stayed here with my dad as a birthday treat for St paddys weekend! Was absolutely fantastic, staff are very friendly, rooms are spotless, the restaurant was delicious and probably one of the best meals we had over the weekend! Would 100% recommend! One of the best hotels I've stayed in! ",5,2015,02,22
211,"Good Location, Friendly Staff and Free Parking","Stayed at the Croke Park Hotel upon our arrival to Dublin.  It was pretty easy for a travel-weary family to locate, which was a big plus after the red-eye from New York.  We can't say enough about the friendliness and helpfulness of the staff.  They really got our Ireland experience off to a great start.  The room was plenty spacious for 3 adults, very modern and clean.  Parking was conveniently located beneath the building.  The spaces are a bit tight, but as we found out, pretty good by Ireland standards.  We had a great 3 day stay at the Croke Park Hotel, the Hop-On-Hop-Off Bus picks you up right in front of the hotel.  It was a good location to venture forth on our exploration of Dublin.  We would definitely stay there again.",4,2015,02,22
211,Humberling,Lovely hotel. Set out beautifully. Right next to the stadium . clean cherpy. Phillip willing to go out His way and help you. Compliment water bottle as we left. Close to main bus service to Dublin town centre 1/13/16 bus 1.95 euro per person.  Bus to get to town centre from airport 747 . that's 6 euro each person 2nd stop. Hotel will cater to any needs no complains what so ever,5,2015,02,22
211,Brilliant stay,"Can't fault the hotel or it's staff in the slightest. We arrived around four hours before check in due to an early flight and only had to wait around half an hour until a room was found for us thanks to the front desk staff. The room was very spacious, clean and modern with a large comfy bed good.  The only downside is that it is a slight walk to the center (around 15 minutes), even though this is a very straight forward walk. Would recommend booking the hop on hop off bus if the walk isn't for you at a cost of 17 euros pp if booked through the hotel. This picks you up right outside the hotel up till 11.15 am and takes you to numerous tourist locations around the city.",5,2015,02,22
211,Excellent Hotel,"We have just returned from a 2night break at The Croke Park Hotel. Its our 3rd time to use this Hotel. It will not be our last . Great car parking available. Reception staff and concerge were very welcoming and helpful. We wished to play golf we were given very good guidance and enjoyed our game. The staff in the dining room were very professional and friendly. Breakfast has everything one could  want .A good choice of fresh fruit ,cheeses ,breads ,cereals, pastries, jams ,cold meats and of course the"" Full Irish"". Dinner was equally good.The bedroom and bathroom were comfortable ,spacious and very clean. Can't wait to stay again.",5,2015,02,21
211,A real Gem!,"Our first visit to this hotel. It was  excellent. My flight arrived late morning and I had requested an early check in. Our room was ready and check in was quick.  Nice to have parking on site. The room was very nice, clean and was quiet to a weary traveler.  The breakfast was outstanding.  A nice variety. I'd go as far as saying this was the best breakfast in any hotel I ever ate.  Service was prompt and the hot coffee kept coming. 

Upon check out, which was fast, bottled water was given. Now that's just a thoughtful thing, and sometimes it's those things that mean a lot.

I highly recommend this hotel and I would stay there again if ever in Dublin.",5,2015,02,20
211,Excellent value and service ,"We picked this hotel as a decent priced base for our stay in Dublin.
The service was excellent from the moment we arrived. Super friendly staff and a great room with the most comfortable bed imaginable.
We had a meal in the Sideline Bar which was most enjoyable and great value too. We will definitely be returning in the near future.
",5,2015,02,20
211,Fantastic Hotel! Highly Reccomended!,"We have just finished a 3 night stay here and we were more than happy with it! The staff were attentive and the rooms spotless! The location of the hotel is a fair walk to the liveliness of the city but that became a good thing of an evening when you wanted a calm and quite atmosphere to relax in! The Restarhunt (The sideline bistro) was delicious and Id highly recommend trying the duck! You'l find a free in-room safe to store your belongings and it locks with a personalised 4-digit code to save you the hassle of carrying and worrying about a safe key! However, If you want a taxi into the city, try to avoid asking the front of house to book you one as this entails an additional €2 booking fee with the taxi firm and it's easy enough to go outside and hussle one yourself! More of a tip then issue! I would defiantly stay in this hotel again and thought it was excellent value for money!",5,2015,02,20
211,Perfect hotel and perfect weekend,"Booked a weekend away in Dublin with my husband as it is somewhere we have always wanted to go . Chose the Croke Park hotel on the back of great reviews on trip advisor and so glad we did. The stay was excellent from the minute we booked in (which was in the middle of the day with a lobby packed full to the brim with football fans from the stadium directly opposite). The staff were so friendly and could not do enough for us. The room was huge with a lovely bath robe and slippers, hairdryer, safe, mini bar, toiletries and huge bathroom with bath and separate shower. The breakfast was of good quality with everything you need to set you up for the day. The concierge was very knowledgable and gave us ideas of how to spend our time in Dublin. We bought the hop on, hop off bus ticket which lasts for two days and so glad we did. The sun was shining so we sat on the open top bus and were shown the sights of Dublin by one of the bus drivers, who was funny as well as knowledgable. The two day pass cost €17 each. We went to temple bar, and although really quaint, is expensive but still worth it for the atmosphere and a tipple or two. We went to the little museum near St Stephens square and it was free if you ask the driver for tickets. Very interesting little place and full of interesting artefacts. We took in a game of hurling at the croke park stadium on the Sunday which was a first time experience for us both. The Guinness storehouse is worth a visit but only to say you have been there; wouldn't go again. We loved Dublin and will definitely be going back. The staff at the hotel and the people of Dublin made our stay amazing. Thank you so much, no wonder this hotel gets booked up in advance so quickly. Yes it is a good 15-20 minute walk to town but you can get a taxi for 8 euros to O'Connell St and to be fair if you are trying to do things on a shoestring, you should go to Butlins not Dublin. In temple bar, expect to pay €6.50 a pint or €4.50 in a less touristy place. We will be returning to go to the prison which was not fully open when we went and are very much looking forward to doing this as it is supposed to be an amazing and emotive place. A taxi from the hotel to the airport is €20 or you could apparently get a bus for €2.80 but it goes round the houses; we will try this next time though.",5,2015,02,19
211,Great Hospitality and Accommodation at Croke Park Hotel,"We won the two-night stay at the Croke Park Hotel in a draw which our football club ran last year. We knew of the hotel, due to my husband's frequent visits to Croke Park, but we have never stayed in it. The expiry date on the tickets was January 2015, but due to my mother falling ill last summer (2014) and eventually passing away in October 2014, we were not able to use the tickets last year. Upon contacting the hotel to try and discuss an extension to the expiry date, the staff were very helpful and agreed to allow us to use the ticket during our children's mid-term break in February 2015. We greatly appreciated this, due to the fact that we were unable to take the children on holidays at any stage last year.
Upon arrival at the hotel, it was very obvious how customer-orientated the hotel is. Underground parking, purposely built family rooms (able to accommodate up to 5 people), excellent spacious en-suites in the bedrooms including  separate shower facilities and wonderful food. In comparison to other hotels which we have stayed in, the Croke Park Hotel is a step above the rest. Small items such as hand cloths in the clean toilet facilities, and a wide selection of cereals and preserves at breakfast time make it stand out in our opinion.
Any time we head down to Dublin in the future, we would love to be able to stay in the Croke Park Hotel. We would definitely not hesitate to recommend it to our relatives and friends.

Anne O'Hagan",5,2015,02,19
211,Great hotel.,"Nice hotel with lovely public areas and a nice room. Staff were very helpful and we got hot towels on arrival and bottles of water on check out. Nice touch. When we got to the room we were pleasantly surprised to find complimentary prosecco for us because it was my wife's birthday.  The green hop on hop off bus shuttles into town centre in the morning but it is only a ten min walk to O'Connell street anyway. Would stay here again, I just wish breakfast was cheaper, the €14.95 price tag put us off! ",5,2015,02,19
211,"Clean and good location, poor if you don't like Gaelic football though!","Arrived on Friday 13th with my girlfriend for a weekend away to celebrate Valentine's day, was looking for a relaxing hotel and we did get this but only in patches. It's a good 15 minute walk to the city centre and you will probably need taxi's everywhere so can become costly! However the noise is very high at the weekends because how close it is to the stadium with all the fans using the hotel as pre and post drinks location. Overall left disappointed for the price I paid! ",3,2015,02,18
211,"Welcoming, clean, great food, great staff, great price. Perfect choice.",This place is amazing I cannot fault it at all. We went for a birthday weekend to Dublin and all the staff were extremely attentive and welcoming. They gave us amazing advice on where to go what to visit. The hotel room was clean tidy always stocked up with refreshments. We received complimentary biscuits and milk; prosecco and food for my birthday celebrations! Cannot fault this place at all. The location doesn't look great but the hotel overrides this factor. They made our city break perfect! ,5,2015,02,18
211,Great staff,We stayed at Croke Park hotel on a Subday night. It was very busy after some games at Croke park but our stay couldn't be faulted. We were in a lovely room on fourth floor-spacious which helped as we had two children with us. A few nice surprises in our room too! We ate in the restaurant and while the food was nice it was the friendly helpful staff that made it much more enjoyable. Would definitely recommend it.,4,2015,02,18
211,Football place,"Excellent breakfast, but really bad coffee.Big rooms, small bath.Really busy at football match time because it is close to the stadium.
Stuff kind and efficient. So far of city centre of Dublin. Costumer service advice warning us about busy times at restaurant for dinner and breakfast.",4,2015,02,17
211,Weekend trip to Dublin,"Booked the Croke Park Hotel because of the reviews on Tripadvisor and we weren't disappointed. We are a family of 3 (2 adults and a 3 year old) and we had a room with 2 double beds. The beds were plenty big enough for all of us. 

The hotel has a really classy feel to it and on arrival we parked in the covered free car park. check in was smooth and easy. we ate in the bar on the first night and the menu was good, and not too expensive considering you are in Dublin. Even had a really good kids menu.

The rooms were spotless and quite large. We had a room on the roadside next to the stadium and this is where i found the only slight fault. The windows in our room (215) had very bad sound/draught insulation so we could hear the road noise very easily. We soon sorted out the heating to compensate for the draught and the road noise does die down at night because of the lack of traffic hence only a slight issue.

The hotel is a good 20 minutes walk into the centre of Dublin but the red sight seeing buses have 2 routes, red and blue, blue goes right past the hotel but is only every 1 hour whereas the red route runs every 15 miutes but you have a 5 minute walk to get it. These buses are hop on hop off and a 19 euro ticket covers 2 days and does a tour of the city.

Would i stay here again, definitely.",4,2015,02,17
211,Perfect as usual,"Spent an unexpected night at the hotel and as usual everything was first class. I had a meal in the Sideline Bistro and the roast lamb was fantastic.

Great breakfast .
Will be staying there again this weekend",5,2015,02,17
211,Lovely Hotel but........,"Stayed here February 2015. Lovely Hotel in a great location if ur going to Croke Park!  The room was large & spacious and well decorated with Large TV. Very comfortable room my only disappointment was that the room was icy cold.  You have to set the heating yourself & it takes a while to warm it up.  The bathroom was huge and impressive with a seperate shower & bath. The also provided a decent hairdyrer:) Tea & Coffee making is available in the room but an extra couple of tea bags would have been good!  

We had our dinner in the Side line bistro & were very disappointed with the food.  We ordered the Burger & Chunky chips and felt at 15.00 euro it was way over priced!!!  We did mention to the staff on our departure from the restaurant that we felt the food was not great & they had no interest at all on our views.:( Also in the Bar we asked for a glass to be changed as it was covered in Pink Lipstick, she proceeded to examine the glass in detail in an exagerated manner to make sure it had the said Pink lipstick on it........which it did. She proceeded to give me another one and acted like I had commited a major crime by bringing it to her attention.  

The Breakfast however was fabulous & well worth the 5.00 euro tray charge.  

This is an ideal hotel for visiting Croke Park but if u fancy exploring Dublin City Centre you would be better off staying in the city centre.",4,2015,02,17
211,Your home whilst in Dublin...very true!!,"We had stayed here once before and decided to return to celebrate my partners birthday. We arrived on Saturday and the hotel was very busy. The car park is not charged and a great bonus. We were made to feel welcome by Catherine and Dympna. Our room was not ready as we were 2 hours early but we were allowed to go to the executive lounge to get refreshments which was great. To our surprise we were told our suite was ready..The Sam Maguire Suite. It is a spacious beautiful room with a sitting room and lovely bathroom. Aishlene in the bar is so friendly and she remembered us from last time and made us very welcome. The breakfast is excellent and there is a good selection to choose from. We decided to have room service deliver breakfast and at 5 euros, well worth it. It took us only 15 minutes to walk to O""Connell street. A taxi from Temple bar back was roughly 8 euros. We dined as part of our package one evening and enjoyed a 4 course meal each. The food is amazing and very well presented. Service from Pascale, Lucilla and Andrea was also excellent. There was a gentleman supervising who was also most pleasant..sorry I did not get your name. Alex and Rachel on room service also deserve a mention. As it was a birthday celebration the staff went out of their way to ensure they added to the celebration. Def the next time we are in Dublin will we make Croke Park Hotel our home again for a weekend. Excellent staff who all give 5 star treatment. Thank you to everyone who made our stay so brilllant.",5,2015,02,17
211,Best hotel in Dublin,"We spent 4 nights at this hotel last week and once again the service was fantastic. We have been staying at this hotel for 8 years and it never fails to impress. The staff are excellent and go out of their way to accommodate guests needs. It is the little things that make this place so great. The check in staff are very friendly. The staff in the Sideline bar are also fantastic, bringing out games and puzzles to keep our little ones entertained. Great breakfast selection and the hot chocolates for the children were greatly appreciated. Free secure parking is a bonus in a hotel so close to the city centre. Easy walk into the city centre or you can easily get the hop on hop off bus. Best hotel in Dublin, stay here you won't be disappointed!",5,2015,02,16
211,Great value,Stayed here with my wife and one other couple on Sunday night 16th great value bed and breakfast €109 for both of us free parking directly under the hotel we are in the restaurant again beautiful meal very reasonably priced found the staff to  be most polite and helpful rooms were spotless and well layed out will definitely be coming back to stay here again ,5,2015,02,16
211,Very good experience,I booked this hotel for the Ireland France 6 nations game. It was much more reasonably priced than other hotels in Dublin for this weekend and conveniently located in the City Centre. Staff were very friendly and helpful; the room was spacious and comfortable and quiet. The breakfast was good and staff were very attentive.,5,2015,02,16
211,Absolutely Fantastic,"This really is a fantastic hotel. Great location, minutes walk from city centre, and free secure parking is a big bonus in Dublin. 

Yes, the rooms are great, very quiet, spotlessly clean, luxury bathroom. Great food in Bistro, and presentation of food is first class. I was ridiculously impressed by my latte.( Sad, I know!) But forget about all that, what really makes this hotel is the staff. I know that sounds cheesy, and I don't know how this hotel manages it, but they have somehow managed to employ an amazing team. Nothing is too much bother for any employee, and they are genuinely helpful, friendly and professional.

I so recommend a stay here, the service here is what all other hotels should strive to achieve.",5,2015,02,16
211,Great value and exceptional service,"We spent 2 nights at this hotel after a lastminute deal. On arrival the staff provided hot towels to freshen up and allowed us to check in early as they had a room available. The room was lovely - really big, very comfortable bed with plenty of nice toiletries soft towels and tea and coffee.
Although the hotel is not central, it is only a 15 minute walk into the center which we enjoyed.
The hotel has a great feel to it and being opposite to the entrance of the stadium it has a lively and sporty atmosphere - buzzing on the match day!
Nothing was too much trouble and we were offered free bottles of water when we were leaving
It's an easy journey from and to the airport - taxi us about 13 euro or the 16a or 41 bus brings to just around the corner to drumcondra rail station. - 5 minute walk
All the staff in every part of the hotel were very friendly and I would definitely book this hotel again
Thank you for a lovely stay
",5,2015,02,15
211,Luxurious Hotel,"Had a really lovely stay at the hotel - room was cleaned perfectly everyday, staff were really really nice and helpful and although the restaurant food was pricey, it was worth it - best lamb rump I have ever eaten!!!

Bus 16 to the airport is really quick and only about 5-10 mins to hotel. 15/20 mins walk in to the centre from the hotel. The only problem was that the hotel is in a really rough looking location BUT nothing happened during the 4 day stay and not a long walk. 

The hotel has the best gym! (with free fruit).

The only issue was that the mini fridge was really expensive and that the card uses to go up in the lift took about 5 tries to make it work every time (I found that this wasn't just our cards but after speaking to some other guests at the hotel.. this was a common problem!) - but apart from that...

The hotel is beautifully posh and luxurious! We had the best romantic stay!",5,2015,02,15
211,Great week in Dublin,"Croke Park Hotel stay was great, with plenty of things to do, parking was a plus with Dublin as any large city has parking challenges. 20 minutes to the Liffey and city center. Sports Stadium across hotel convent for sports fans.",5,2015,02,15
211,"Luxury,  Functional & Excellent Service ","The title says it all,  arrived at around 8am and our room was ready for us.

The room was huge as was the bed  and bathroom- the bathroom had both a bath and shower which was great.
Very clean room 

No issues through our entire stay  good location 10-15mins out of the city centre

Great service  from all staff encountered and the cleaners were great 

One note of caution the mini fridge automatically charges you when you remove a drink,  whether to just look at it although  it you just mention it to the front desk all will be sorted quickly

Overall a great stay would definitely recommend and return myself. ",5,2015,02,14
211,Top notch,"Stayed here for a few nights with family and cannot fault the place. Loved the Irish hospitality. Was always pleasant arriving back at the hotel to familarity and pleasant staff. During breakfast the staff were very accomodating as we ordered bespoke items that werent part of the buffet breakfast.

We had free WiFi and newspapers for the duration of our stay all for giving my email to them and have never received marketing junk either.

Hotel is directly opposite the croke park stadium so good if you plan a visit there otherwise a bit far out from the hustle and bustle of the city...but no biggy as can be reached quite easily by taxi or the tour bus stops there at set times in the morning and returning in the afternoon. 

We also caught the normal bus but feel this was bit of a pain due to the walk from the hotel and the duration waiting for the bus.

We had a good deal with our booking so was good value for money.

Overall a great stay here. 
",5,2015,02,14
211,Excellent!,"Enjoyed a four night leisure break at the Croke Park this week and can't fault the hotel. From arrival to departure everything was perfect, the staff friendly and helpful, the room very comfortable and the food first class.
Thanks for helping to make our stay in Dublin so enjoyable.",5,2015,02,13
211,Great hotel!,"We had to locate a hotel for our last minute trip to Dublin and we were pleased with our choice! The hotel is very modern, roomy, and lovely staff. Although, it is not very close to city attractions you can catch an Uber and get to things quickly. We braved the walk a few days and it took approximately 25-30 minutes to get downtown. You can reach a few restaurants within a 10-15 minute walk, however they do close early. Overall, we enjoyed our stay and loved Dublin! Make sure you take the train to Howth! It was our favorite part of the trip. ",5,2015,02,12
211,Great hotel!,"We arrived sunday and stayed till wednesday. Phillip was very nice at reception and helped us check in early. We were there with our 6month old and grandparents so had two rooms, both very clean and spacious. My mum and dad ate in hotel one night and said it was lovely, not the cheapest but worth it. Cant fault the hotel. Its about 15min walk to oconnell street then a good bit further to temple bar etc but there is buses available. We were 25euro in a taxi to hotel then 18euro back. I know there is an extra charge sunday but don't think its as much as that so watch out. Would defiantly recommend the hotel.",5,2015,02,12
211,Fantastic base to explore Dublin from,"Just back from a short break with the wife. The Hotel was amazing! From the minute we arrived (where the receptionist offered a warm towel to freshen up whilst checking in), the staff went out of their way to make us feel welcome and extend the true Irish charm that we have all heard about. The hotel food was amazing and the complimentary ticket to the Guiness experience was well worth the effort. I learnt a lot about Irish heritage on a fascinating tour around Croke Park, and just reinforced how ignorant I was.
I highly recommend it to anyone visiting Dublin.",5,2015,02,11
211,HOTEL HEAVEN,"Service was absolutely out of this world. Made to feel welcome from the moment you set through the door. Arrived at 8.30am to be told our room was already available! Room is beautiful, bed is amazingly comfy. whilst I was here with my partner, staff gave us their undivided attention.
enjoyed my stay that much, I am returning in April and already discussing more returns with  other family soon.",5,2015,02,11
211,Great stay,"Spent a very good 2 nights here. Very clean, friendly and helpful stay. Room was a large size for a standard double room. Cannot fault the experience and would highly recommend. Directly opposite the croke park stadium, two games were played when we were staying, this did not effect our stay at all and no noise was heard even though we were on second floor.",5,2015,02,10
211,great!,"very wonderful rooms, very clean and spacious. the bathroom is excellent with luxury products. great beds and pillow. 
It' s located near the stadium, but in 15 minutes walk you can reach the centre of the city.
very recommended!",5,2015,02,10
211,Overnight before Hospital Appointment,I stayed in the Croke Park Hotel with my son prior to early morning appointments in Childrens Hospital in Temple St.  Was very impressed by care and professionalism of front desk staff on evening arrival and lunchtime departure.  Was left in no doubt that should I need any assistance they were very keen to help.  Little touches like welcome face towels were much appreciated after our long drive.,5,2015,02,09
211,"Excellent hotel, great holiday!","I booked this hotel after seeing all the reviews to celebrate my boyfriends birthday and the upcoming birth of our first child. The hotel was a short taxi ride from the airport and upon arrival we were given hot hand towels to warm us up which was a lovely touch as it was very cold outside.
The staff were so friendly and instantly made us feel very welcome, this feeling continued throughout our entire stay and we were made to feel really special as they knew we were celebrating. We had a room on the 4th floor so had access to an executive lounge with a complimentary continental breakfast including croissants and pastrys, fresh smoked salmon, ham and cheese and a selection of cereals, fruits and yoghurts. There were also complimentary bottles of water and (as one night I discovered) a late night biscuit tin put out!!!! 
We ate in the hotel restaurant two nights in a row (being pregnant I fancied an early relaxed dinner without having to go far) and the food was to a very high standard. We ended up having lunch there on sunday too before flying home as the bar area was so relaxed. Everything from the burger and chips or club sandwiches through to the sea bream and stirfried vegetables was simply delicious.
As for the location, ok not the nicest however we walked back to the hotel at around 9.30pm on the friday night and it took 10 minutes from O'Connell street (even at my waddle pace) without any nasty incident (the next night we took a taxi for 7euro). We used the hop on hop off bus during the day which I would recommend to anyone staying there, you can buy tickets from the hotel and there is a hotel shuttle bus that takes you to the first point of the bus tour.
I would really recommend this hotel, the walk into town really isn't bad at all (20 mins to get to temple bar) and the smiling staff, large clean rooms and delicous food were exceptional value for money.
Thank you to the staff for giving us such a fantastic holiday!!
ps we were also there on a match day at Croke park and the hotel was PACKED full of people after the match however once in our room we heard no noise and were not disturbed once!",5,2015,02,09
211,Gaa Weekend,"We arrived for our weekend to be greeted by very friendly and professional reception staff, the porter was also more than helpful.  Our room was lovely, clean and well presented with a lovely view of Croke Park (as requested), when my youngest son suffered from a high temperature on our first night the night porter went out of his way to help my wife secure some medication, the only negative for my whole experience was that the wait time for breakfast and the slight dealy in securing a table, don't get me wrong there seemed to be ample staff but they lacked efficiency but the quality of food was top class!",5,2015,02,09
211,"Luxurious stay, gorgeous comfy beds","From the heated hand towel at reception on arrival, to the extremely comfortable bed, gorgeous breakfast and a bottle of water given on check out - this hotel goes way beyond the normal to make you feel very welcome and more than just a number. I got dinner served to my room and it was gorgeous. I stay in hotels around the country every week and this has been my best experience so far. I am looking forward to returning!",5,2015,02,09
211,A fantastic weekend away!,I wanted to book a surprise weekend away for my boyfriend so spend a lot of time looking for the perfect hotel. I can't fault the croke park hotel at all. From the minute we arrived the members of staff were so helpful and polite. We arrived at 7am and they had our room ready for us even though check in wasn't till 2pm. This was fantastic for us as we were both so tired from travelling we just wanted to crash out in the room for a bit. The rooms were lovely and just what we needed. When going to the bar downstairs we were offered bottles of water and nibbles on the table which was a lovely touch. I genuinely felt like the staff members couldn't do enough to help and it really made our trip a pleasant experience. I will definitely recommend and hopefully return again soon x,5,2015,02,08
211,Lovely Hotel,"We stayed here on 31st January for 2 nights as a city break stay booked for my birthday. The hotel is lovely and we walked into the centre of Dublin (10mins) but would recommend a taxi if coming back later at night. The staff are a credit to the hotel and will go out of their way to help you out! We needed directions to Kilmainham Gaol and was given a tourist map with clear transport instructions! Fabulous. 
We ate at the hotel on the first night and the food is great too. Would recommend 

Also there is a great Italian opposite the castle called Toscana which was fantastic! 
All in all a great hotel not far from city centre. 
The rooms are big enough for a short stay and very clean with tea and coffee facilities
Will stay again on return  to Dublin!  ",5,2015,02,08
211,I keep going back,"Decided to write a second comment on this property, as I keep coming back and it doesn't disappoint. At this stage I'm familiar with pretty much everyone in the hotel, and I'm glad to report that they keep on delivering great service. Hospitality is fabulous, this is seriously great value for money. Allegedly, this is not the best part of Dublin (true!), however for a business traveler like I am, it's perfectly located near East Point Business Park. Their free shuttle with their super friendly driver will take me back and forth as needed. Great bed, very good amenities, awesome fruit tray every day plus two bottles of water, breakfast included...",5,2015,02,08
211,Nothing was a problem,Just back from a night here with my three teenagers and hubby. From the minute we arrived nothing was a problem. Greeted with a smile every time. Great security in lifts/ doors to bedrooms. Highly recommend it to anyone,5,2015,02,08
211,Great business hotel,"Well the location of the hotel is not the best, i.e. not in the center of the city, and also the rooms are too small; however I say that people make it up for it. Very nice, boutique hotel, next to a great sports venue. Initially I got a room, which had no hot water. But then hotel folks changed the room, and it was all good. Everything else is functioning, breakfast is nice, and the hotel manager Catherine was so kind to apologize at the time of check-out for the trouble of room change.

I would strongly recommend this hotel if your business is not too far from this location",4,2015,02,07
211,Short stay ,"Stayed here for family gathering for one night,this hotel is well worth staying in,food lovely staff were excellent will stay here again .hotel just across from croke park which is worth visiting and easy to get to city centre walking taxi or bus",5,2015,02,07
211,just as good second time around,"this was our second stay at the hotel, and it was just as good as our first three years ago.

the hotel has a tasteful modern feel and all the common areas were clean and well presented. the staff were friendly and any service requests we had were handled promptly with a smile. we only had one meal in the sideline bar but the service and quality was great.

I had asked during the booking process for a nice room as we were celebrating our anniversary during the trip, and on arrival we received a complimentary upgrade to the executive floor which included continental breakfast, free parking, and wi-fi, then whilst we were unpacking our cases, room service arrived to deliver a complimentary bottle of sparkling.

again the hotel is a small way out of the city, but it’s still only a 5-10 minute walk to O’Connell Street and a €8-10 taxi from the city centre

I’m sure we’ll be back again",5,2015,02,05
211,Wonderful stay!,"Stayed at the Croke Park Hotel for a week on a recent business trip with some international colleagues. The staff were extremely friendly, welcoming, and helpful with any sort of queries. 

The location is perfect for the city-centre - less than Eur10 in a taxi or a nice 20-minute walk into the centre of town. It's perfect for guests who are visiting Croke Park (literally across the road). Very convenient for Dublin airport, or getting to the M50 for traveling outside of Dublin. 

The bedrooms are spacious, spotless, and very comfortable. The bathrooms are the cleanest I think I've ever seen in a hotel! 

The hotel bar and restaurant are pretty great. Good menu, reasonably priced, and quick staff. 

I'd thoroughly recommend this hotel, and thank the staff for looking after us so well.",5,2015,02,05
211,Wonderful Stay,"The staff at the hotel are particularly friendly, everyone made the experience feel professional, warm and efficient. We had easy access to other parts of Dublin and the room was nicely decorated to feel comfortable. I would highly recommend the Croke Park Hotel to anyone visiting Dublin.",5,2015,02,05
211,Treated so well,"I stayed here recently with my husband for two nights and we had a wonderful, relaxing experience. Staff were exceptionally nice and polite and the quality of room was top class. Everything you could need in the room and room service was no problem at 9.30pm. Parking on site was an added bonus.",5,2015,02,03
211,Definitely out of the way but they also go out of their way to make up for this,Great Dublin base if you are lazy travellers like us who like to run about during the day and then settle in for a quiet evening. Executive club deal good value. King size.bed glorious. Food in restaurant excellent. Staff are lovely. Sleep well!!!,5,2015,02,03
211,Lovely place to stay ,"Nothing but nice things to say about this hotel. The room we had was very clean, had a huge bathroom with a nice bath tub, and an extremely comfortable bed. The customer service was outstanding and the parking garage was well lit. Would definitely stay here again. The food in the restaurant downstairs was very good and the prices at the bar were fair. ",5,2015,02,03
211,Everything that you want in a Hotel,"I was on a trip with my 2 boys. This was the first time all 3 of use went out of the country together, so I was a bit nervous. I hoped that all was going to go well. We stayed at The Croke Park Hotel for 2 nights and it was fabulous! They greet you at the door and help you with your bags to the room. They have a fantastic dining room and super awesome food! They were very helpful with everything! Clean rooms, comfy beds, awesome amenities. Perfect all around!",5,2015,02,03
211,Spoiled for a week-end.,"We had a family get-to-gathering of 4 brothers and 4 wives in this very reasonable priced,wonderful and easy accessible hotel.The bedrooms were very comfortable,the bar and restauraunt areas very inviting and relaxing and with free parking so close to the city centre what more could one ask for.",5,2015,02,03
211,Winter Getaway,"Perfect early start to the Christmas festivities! 
From the minute we checked in to check out, we really felt like valuable guests. Staff were very pleasant and most helpful. Our room was ready when we checked in. So we dropped our bags and got something to eat in the bar. The food was delicious - even if it was just lunch (soup/sandwitch). 
Our room was a standard, with a double and single bed. Big bathroom and very spacious. We had a few drinks in the bar upon our return from a spot of shopping and a wander around the city. The added bonus of some nibbles left on our table, was unexpected. The staff go above and beyond and the little touches throughout - especially the bottled water upon check out is such a lovely thought. Very rare in these times to have these little touches. Well done Croke Park hotel. 
We had a lovely visit away, would definitely return to the lovely Croke Park hotel.",4,2015,02,03
211,Comfortable and quiet,"First time staying and I really enjoyed this hotel, very comfortable and quiet rooms.
Checking in took a while as this room was booked to include breakfast which didn't show up so had to email the reception desk my confirmation email which could have been avoided. So lost a mark for this.
Dinner in the restaurant was lovely, breakfast fresh and tasty.
Had lunch also which was one of the best club sandwiches ive ever had.
I would definitely stay in this hotel again on trips to Dublin.",4,2015,02,02
211,excelent stay at Croke Park hotel,"We went to Ireland to visit our son who is studying in Dublin together with his girlfriend and brother. We realy enjoyed our stay in the hotel. The rooms were comfortable and the people working in the hotel all were very nice and friendly. If we visit our son again, I'm sure we will book this hotel again.",5,2015,02,02
211,Not bad but not the best service or food,"This hotel was okay but the food was a little bit average. I was supposed to be on a VIP trip and the room they put us into was overlooking the train tracks. Not very pleasant at all. When I asked the staff to send up a robe and slippers nothing appeared, even though we were there for 2 nights. The possible saving grace is that I wrote to the manager after the trip to explain all of this and they did apologise and offer me two free nights.",3,2015,02,02
211,Well impressed! It's the little things that count!,"We wanted to visit Croke Park Museum and the hotel had a family offer too good to refuse; family room, bed and breakfast, evening meal and tickets for Croke Park museum and tour of the stadium.
We were made feel very welcome and staff were excellent, organising toys/jigsaws for the children as we relaxed in the lounge. One of the kids loved the little biscuit that came with your coffee and the next thing a waitress brought down a plate of them for him and a glass of milk! It's only small I know but not something I experience too often in other hotels. Again, when our 8 year old wanted to watch the match that was being screened but couldn't find a seat, a waiter took the time to sort out a suitable viewing point for him. All these little things made for a very relaxing and enjoyable stay.",5,2015,02,02
211,Fantastic!!,"Stayed here on a weekend break with my other half. Perfect location, not too far from the city centre 20 mins walking wise, €10-12 in a taxi. 
Not too far from airport €20 in taxi. Superb friendly staff and guests, very helpful.

Very friendly staff especially Michelle, recommended top places to visit on days out and eating at night. One of the best weekends in temple bar, live music in Fitzsimons - brilliant bar!

Fantastic service. Will be back very soon!! 
Thanks for a wonderful stay! ",5,2015,02,01
211,Take a Bow - All Ireland Winning Performance,"Not for the first time the Croke Park Hotel greatly surpassed my expectations as a place to stay and eat. How does a hotel in not so brilliant a location, especially at night time, that has nice but relatively modest rooms, has very good food but not exceptional fare, a limited cocktail list do so well!  Simple, its USP, it's real differentiation are its people - first if all there are enough of them - most importantly they are well trained, interested in serving you, courteous, friendly and bloody good at their job.  I love this hotel and will be back.  The small details are excellent superb public facilities, proper soaps and towels in the loos, lots of free newspapers, etc.

However, based on your strong reputation you need to stay focussed on a few things - the hot towels at check in are great, but clear away the last customers towels and offer them to all customers, I wasn't offered any - clearing tables after dinner should happen reasonably quickly after the table all lay down their knifes and forks - look at your pre arrival list from your customer and do what they ask or else tell them why you can't.  Your cocktail lust is boring too many gin, rum and vodka versions, you need a few decent whiskey drinks like whiskey sours.

Great job, a credit to Dublin and Ireland, any tourists looking for a place to stay should have you on their shortlist as well as any Irish folk looking for a really nice break.",5,2015,02,01
211,Suaimhneach... Baile Átha Cliath,"I stayed here mid-week for a business conference in January. It's a great location - 15 mins from the airport by taxi (not in rush hour!) and served locally by plenty of good restaurants locally. 

My room (143) was large, well appointed and of a very high standard.

Thanks for a good stay.",5,2015,02,01
211,Would return! ,Stayed here with 2 friends for the night. Was lovely hotel and location was fine for what we needed. Hotel had all the usual amenities as well. Very comfy bed. Would recommend this hotel. I would return but I would probably stay longer than 1 night next time.,3,2015,02,01

211,Fantastic staff and lovely Hotel,This hotel is a fantastic place to stay.  The rooms are pristine. The food is great and the staff are friendly and courteous. A real gem of a hotel.  The price is an absolute bargain for the service provided. Extremely highly recommended. Only a short walk from the city centre and on the doorstep of the famous croke park. ,5,2015,01,30
211,MINI TRAVEL,"We´ve been in Dublín for 3 days in this hotel, and i have to say the beds are so confortable, and the bathroom very clean,
we are so happy with the hotel, and i have to say the breakfast was really good, we´ll be back to the same one,

just one Little thing, is not close to the city center, may be just walking 15 min, and if you want to do some tours, you should take a taxi,
",5,2015,01,29
211,very nice,"Very pleasant hotel, the staff was kind and helpful, clean and comfortable room. Tasty breakfast with variety of food. Bar was really good in the hotel. WiFi was all right, working perfect. I trully recommend this place.",5,2015,01,28
211,I've found a new hotel for trips to Dublin,"The Croke Park Hotel is definitely my go-to hotel for return trips to Dublin!  The staff are exceptional, the rooms are spotless and the food is great.  For business (or pleasure), you can't beat the price for an upscale hotel so close to downtown Dublin.   ",5,2015,01,28
211,Wonderful service and beautiful hotel,"Arrived at the hotel very early after a 6am flight from the UK. I had hoped to leave bags on reception and instead the wonderful man on reception let me check in finding a room available. Beautiful rooms extremely comfortable. Great service and drinks.
Thank you",5,2015,01,26
211,Peace and Content,This is a excellent hotel managed and staffed by excellent people. They go out of their way to make your stay enjoyable. I have stayed here quite few times and now eat in the hotel because the food is as good as you will get anywhere and very reasonably priced.,5,2015,01,26
211,"Great Staff, Great Hotel","I stayed at Croke Park Hotel recently. I had a wonderful stay. Welcoming staff. 2 bottles of water given without even asking. Warm smile and Clean room. We were upgraded because I am member of GHA so we were able to access residents lounge with extra food, coffee, newspapers.",5,2015,01,26
211,Brilliant!,"Absolutely lovely staff, so friendly and always willing to help! Felt welcome from the very beginning and nothing is too much effort for the staff here. Room was absolutely lovely. Location is not as central as I would have liked but it's about a 25 minute walk from temple bar and a short taxi journey, however how lovely the hotel was made up for this. I would definitely come back here!  ",5,2015,01,25
211,Very Nice Hotel,"Managed to get a good deal on laterooms for this hotel - very clean - very friendly staff - only downside could be that it is a little out of town - 20-25 minute walk into town centre, ok when walking into town but when you've been walking all day seems forever to walk back! Would recommend though as very nice hotel if you don't want to be right in the city centre.",5,2015,01,23
211,Incredible value for money!,"We booked 3 nights in The Croke Park Hotel through expedia and couldn't have asked for more for our money! Staff we're lovely and helpful, offering us hot towels to warm our hands when we arrived and the room was huge with both bath and shower facilities. A fifteen minute walk into the centre was perfect for us and if you don't fancy the walk one night we would recommend the hotel's bistro.",5,2015,01,23
211,Great hotel but not the location,"Room is spacious and spotlessly clean. Hotel staff is very helpful as well. The only fall back is the location. It is around 20 minutes walk to the city centre but not recommended during night time as the surrounding is quite quiet. Cab to the city centre costs around €13. There's only one restaurant near the hotel. There are other restaurants within 10 minutes walk. Nonetheless, the hotel offers shuttle to East park business centre and Foley Street/IFSC during weekdays. Overall it's a great hotel if you not picky on the location :) ",3,2015,01,23
211,Excellent staff and accomodation,Had four days here. Excellent service from the moment we arrived (hot towels and early admission to the room) to the moment we left ( bottled water for the journey plus help with transport and luggage storage). When we come back to Dublin we will stay here again. ,5,2015,01,22
211,Excellent! Highly Recommend!,"From the moment we pulled into the hotel I was impressed. The hotel looks modern and fresh from the outside. There is a car park available and it was roughly 20EUR from Dublin Airport.

We arrived roughly 8am from the freezing cold and check in wasn't till 2pm. The receptionist (early Saturday 17th January) was so friendly, she had a welcoming smile and offered us warm fresh face-towels to 'warm our hands'...this was such a thoughtful gesture as she could see we were cold. 

The staff were happy to take in our bags for the day and even gave us some advice on what the city had to offer, we decided to buy the Dublin Open Tour Bus tickets which were 17EUR from The Croke Park and lasted for 2 days (24 tour stops). 

The room was very clean and the sheets fresh, the carpets throughout were clean vacuumed. The bathroom offered a bath and a separate stand in shower which was a huge bonus. Toiletries on offer were a good selection and also good quantity, extra box of tissues on offer and also shower caps. The bed was comfortable and very large, ample of pillows available (way too many for me). Mini fridge was fully stocked and available, tea and coffee available. CD player and TV both were difficult to figure out, couldn't get any of the channels to work. 

The bar area was lovely and the food was very tasty. The menu could have had more options and I think this is were improvement could be. The staff in the bar were very slow and I'd doubt if they would notice you even leave as they didn't notice us arrive. They didn't come over to check the food was ok and they didn't offer any more drinks which was disappointing. The reception staff made up for the lack of regard from the bar. 

Overall a great stay and will be returning as can't wait to get back into Dublin! Great hotel and great customer service from the maids and reception staff.",5,2015,01,20
211,"Friendly, efficient staff","I stayed at this hotel during a work trip to Dublin. It's plush and luxurious enough, but what makes it stand out are the staff, who are friendly and attentive. I'd never been to Dublin before and wanted to go for a run, so one of the staff drew me a map of a good route, and offered to lend me a bike if I preferred.

I ended up forgetting my running kit in the hotel when I left, but Irina at reception was able to find it and arrange to have it posted to me.

It's worth noting that the the hotel has signed up to the Fair Hotel initiative, which means they recognise the trade union Mandate, and pledge to treat their staff fairly. This really shows in the attitude of the staff, who are genuinely happy to help.",5,2015,01,20
211,BEST HOTEL,"myself and my husband stayed here last week, it was one of the best hotels we have booked in a long time, the food was fab and the room was class, the most comfortable bed EVER!!!! and the staff were so helpful and friendly. we have already booked our next stay.",5,2015,01,20
211,Dublin had a lot of love,"We stayed at the Croke Park based on prior TripAdvisor suggestions.  When we arrived, we were greeted with friendly staff, an immaculate room and a charming experience.  The front desk never hesitated to assist us with anything we needed and both myself and my two friends truly enjoyed our stay.  If you want cleanliness and a really nice room for a great price - this place was ideal.  I'd definitely consider staying there again when I return in a few weeks time and recommend it to friends traveling into the area as well.",5,2015,01,20
211,Amazing.,"We stayed at this hotel for 3 nights from the 16th jan to the 19th. Our flight landed at around 930 and we decided to make our way to the hotel to try our luck and see if our room was ready. We were greeted by Orla. Her customer service is out of this world. Our room was ready and we were able to check in early free of charge. We were given some warm hand towels to warm our hands and enjoyed a conversation with Orla. We made our way to the room and as I had previously emailed the hotel and asked, there was a happy birthday banner and some balloons up for my partners birthday. We were extremely tired and decided to stay in our room that day. We went down to the bar and had some Guiness and the 2 gentlemen that served us were so polite and friendly - my only regret is that I didn't get their names! (One had ginger hair and a beard and one had dark hair - if you know who they are please praise them!) Upon returning to our room, there was a knock at the door and it was room service delivering two bottles of prosecco on ice, compliments of the hotel. We ordered room service and tele food was lovely. There was then another knock at the door and there was a lady, with 2 chocolates in her hand and asking us did we require anything for the evening such as clean towels or more tea/coffee. We were on the 4th floor and had use of the executive lounge. Breakfast in here was pastries, bread, fruit, yoghurt, cereal, hand and cheeses and was lovely. Overall an amazing stay for my partners birthday, croke park ensured our stay was nothing but perfect with their attention to detail with everything. Thank you and should we ever visit dublin again - we will be back!",5,2015,01,20
211,Don't bother......looking up any other hotel!!,"It's truly an amazing hotel! It's a 4* hotel with the look, feel and service of a 5* hotel. To be honest, I didn't read any of the reviews on here before booking nor did I look at them after. With the price I got, I was expecting the very basic. Instead I got the opposite. The hotel is complete luxury, from the moment you walk in you are treated to exceptional service. The bedrooms are brilliant, very very comfortable. The bathroom is very nice. We stayed here due to McNamee Awards which were taking place across the road so it was very handy for us. Apart from the hotel being fantastic, the staff are wonderful too and treat you like royalty. My GF's nail broke  before the event and Orla in reception gave her a name of a place who duly sorted it out(thank god!). Long story short, it is a fabulous hotel, and whenever I need to stay in Dublin again, I'll be staying here without the need to look up any other hotel.",5,2015,01,19
211,Amazing stay at this friendly & fabulous establishment!,"My partner booked this hotel as a surprise 30th birthday get away for me, having 3 children at home he wanted to make sure it was the perfect retreat for us to kick back & relax. And I must admit We've had the most amazing stay in this hotel and have been thoroughly looked after from checking in to checking out. We were initially impressed that we were able to check into our room having arrived at the hotel at 9.25am, this enabled us to catch some sleep before exploring Dublin, we were greeted with friendly and efficient front of house staff on reception....the 
 warm flannels certainly were a treat! We ate in the hotel  restaurant our first night which was lovely (and a generous portion size for my other half!). The hotel was a nice 20 minute stroll into town but as it is all flat we found this walk to be pleasant. Breakfast was lovely, plenty to choose from and all the staff were attentive to our every need. Thoroughly enjoyed our stay here and will definitely be coming back in the future. Thanks Croke park for a fab 30th weekend!! ",5,2015,01,19
211,I can't rate this hotel highly enough !,"I use this hotel for all my overnight business stays in Dublin and I just can't praise it enough. There's unbelievable rates available during week, underground safe free car parking for residents. Staff are immaculate and so well trained, true Irish hospitality at its best.  Rooms so clean, quiet, comfortable with great bathrooms. Food is 2nd to none.  I could go on & on, but you get the picture. A hidden gem🌟",5,2015,01,19
211,Cracking Croke Park,"Stayed one night, was fortunate to be upgraded to suite but regardless of this nice little perk the entire experience was outstanding. The hotel was spotless, the staff could not have been more helpful and the location for Dublin City centre was great, with only a pleasant 20 minute  stroll to O`Connell Street. We will be back and recommending it to even our fussiest friends.",5,2015,01,19
211,GORGEOUS HOTEL SO CLOSE TO THE CENTRE OF DUBLIN,"15 minutes walk MAX and you are crossing the ha'penny bridge .....
We stayed for a long weekend and found the room and facilities brilliant , great bar and reception area with brilliant breakfast for the so called greasy and continental option . 
we had a few spare hours one morning and walked next door to do the croke park stadium tour and were not dissappointed and will do the roof walk tour next time were on the emerald isle . . .
we caught the 6 euro bus from the airport and jumped off and walked for about 2 minutes along a canal to the hotel but cabs from o'connell street are 20 euros...",5,2015,01,19
211,Exceptional Hotel and staff,This was my fourth time staying at the croke park hotel and as the previous three times this hotel is amazing.The staff are so friendly specially Orla on the desk and catherine the front house manager.Food was excellent as always plenty of choice for breakfast>We hope to be back again soon,5,2015,01,18
211,Never before have I given a review after only ONE HOUR !! ,"Honestly just got here and wanted to tell someone how good this hotel seems on first impression ! Hotels like this that in fairness because of their location seldom care much because they are fairly sure of a certain amount of business but stright away this hotel is ...
Absolutely spotless and I just ordered a glass of red wine in the bar and asked if they had any small piece of chocolate to go with it. The barman said no but I could see he was already trying to think of a way to give my some chocolate and then he asked me to wait mintue and went off and came back with four mint chocolates sweets from the restaurant ( I guess ) the ones they give out free with the bill..not exactly 75% of the worlds best dark chocolate but they might as well have been because it was so thoughtful and it made me smile a lot that's for sure! And they went pretty well with my glass of red. So, so far so very good :-) ",5,2015,01,17
211,great service with friendly staff,"From check in to check out myself and my husband had a lovely relaxing 2 night stay ...check in was speedy but friendly even offered hot towels which my husband loved ! Bedroom was very well appointed with a separated bath from the shower , we on the fourth floor where you can use the lounge which has tea/coffee ect...........
Breakfast was excellent both mornings , great service by all staff in the breakfast room , pancake were fab !!!
We will defiantly be back as the location , staff and cleanliness were 5 star !! Well done to the team here in the croke park hotel
Oh bottled water offered for onward journey :)",5,2015,01,17
211,An exceptional hotel,"We have stayed at many hotels throughout the world but this is the first time we have wanted to make some form of public comment. This hotel is truly exceptional in its service levels and staff attitude.

Throughout our stay nothing was too much bother for any of the staff. Their attention to detail and ""can do"" attitude was a pleasure to experience. That, coupled with the cleanliness and ambiance of the surroundings made this stay wonderful value for money. 

The private lounge on the fourth floor was a haven of peace and tranquility.

Thank you for a first class stay",5,2015,01,16
211,Excellent,Lovely hotel with excellent restraunt and bar. Ideal location- just a short walk into town and a 15 minute drive from the airport.  Special mention to Michelle at the reception desk who was extremely helpful. ,5,2015,01,16
211,Fantastic hotel,Super hotel with staff who are a credit to the hotel. Everyone really helpful and friendly. Food excellent. Breakfast substantial and really nice. Rooms comfortable and clean. This hotel had everything. Only ten minute walk to city centre. Would definately stay here again.,5,2015,01,15
211,Excellent hotel,"Stayed one night in Jan 2015. Great hotel, staff without exception were v friendly and helpful.  Massive bed, really comfortable and a good selection of  food for breakfast.  We would definitely stay again.",5,2015,01,14
211,Fantastic Customer service!,"I stayed here with my partner for 3 nights, after 1 night I had an accident and had to be wisked off to hospital in an ambulance.  On return to the hotel, the staff were incredibly kind getting me ice packs and whatever I needed.  They even let me stay in the hotel way past checking out time as my flight was much later in the day.  The rooms are fabulous value and I've never slept in such comfortable beds.  I would not hesitate to stay here again.  I highly recommend it.",5,2015,01,13
211,Great Hotel,"From the moment i walked in the door to the time i left, i felt as if i was the most important, guest in the Hotel. The staff were very professional and polite and the quality of the room the cleanliness and the peacefullness was fantastic.
I would stay again when visiting Dublin",5,2015,01,13
211,Excellent hotel,"We had a lovely time spending two nights here for my birthday. Excellent staff and service. The room was imacculately cleaned on our return from a day out. The bed was massive and the bar and resturant offered really nice food. The only downside would be the location as its about a ten minute walk from the centre. That didnt bother us though and we were happy to do the walk each time into town. i think if it had been more central the price would of been far higher. We were happy to walk for the price we paid for the room

For the money we paid we couldnt fault it and it was one of our nicest hotel experiences with the only downside being the location. We will probably stay here again when we next come to Dublin.",5,2015,01,12
211,Quiet hotel with easy access to downtown Dublin,"We had an extremely positive experience here in July 2014. The rooms were lovely and comfortable, we had a full breakfast downstairs every morning which gave us a good start to long days of travel. It was extremely easy to get to downtown Dublin by walking or taking the bus. I would highly recommend to anyone looking to stay in Dublin. It is also close to train stations so it is easy to day trip to the surrounding cities.",4,2015,01,11
211,Poor Experience for a Lovely Hotel,"Hotel messed up booking on what was our 1st Wedding Anniversary weekend with the Kids,Hotel is excellent but service totally lets it down,Food is lovely in Bistro but we encountered unbelievable slow service",2,2015,01,11
211,A great hotel & so convenient for Croke Park!,"I spent 2 nights here attending the GAA conference, and wasn't disappointed. Exceptionally convenient for the stadium (it can't get any closer!). Service in the bar and restaurant was very good, and the food etc was good (if a little expensive - which you would expect to some extent). No complaints of any sort, and I'd be very happy to stay again! (Although I suspect when big matches are on it will be difficult to find ANY free rooms, unless you plan well in advance - or are possibly from Kerry, when it seems a final is almost an annual occasion!).",5,2015,01,11
211,"Excellent hotel with a hardworking, friendly and helpful staff","Stayed in hotel for a conference with my wife and newborn baby. Room was very comfortable and immaculate. 
Breakfast was tasty and bar was buzzing in the evening. 
Staff facilitated a late check out and any request was delivery promptly",5,2015,01,11
211,Hidden g in Dublin,What a wonderful stay! The staff was great! Hotel was super modern and cute. Just on the outside of dublin but a quick can ride or walk to city center. Only thing if you want a cab use halo application otherwise of the desk calls for you there is an additional charge from the cab driver. Wish we knew that at the beginning not the end. A driver shared that with us and we could have saved 2-4 euros each time which adds up. Other than that the stay was perfect! Beds are comfy rooms were super clean and the staff in the bar was a joy! The front desk staff was warm and helpful. ,5,2015,01,10
211,great hotel,"Great hotel, staff very friendly and helpful, rooms spacious and clean. Upgraded due to birthday, was a very nice gesture. Breakfast really good, plenty of choice. Not to far from the centre, which cost 10 euro each way with taxi. Will definitely stay here again, if visiting Dublin in the future.",5,2015,01,10
211,"Great amenities, terrible location","I stayed here for four nights. It was my first time to Ireland. I was just there as a total tourist, nothing more.

I think the hotel itself was great. All the staff I encountered minus two bartenders were excellent. They apparently weren't supporters of the football club playing that night that I was watching. Tip to you two fellas...don't make snide remarks, keep your mouths shut, and serve the drinks. Not interested in anything else. I didn't complain but I didn't tip them either. Felt that was enough. The irony of this is I wouldn't of heard any of their remarks if they didn't turn the volume down on the TV in the first place. Another table complained that the tv was too loud (it wasn't) so they turned it down. It's a hotel bar, not a library.

The breakfast here is outstanding. Highly recommend it. Walk in and they are asking u right away, ""coffee or tea? toast?"".  Great service.  I also had dinner here on my last night and it was OUTSTANDING! Had the caeser salad w/cajun chicken, the turkey/ham/root veggie entree, and the cheesecake.  Fantastic.

My main issue was with the location of the hotel. It's about a ten to 15 minute walk to O'Connell St.  But it's through a very dodgy neighborhood. I walked it once when I went out first night. I wouldn't walk back to hotel late at night. Didn't feel safe at all to me. So I took a cab from beginning of O'Connell St each night. That ran about 6 Euro. That adds up.

All in all, nice hotel in bad location. Amazing food and mostly excellent bar staff. I won't let two idiots ruin the whole staff's reputation. Everyone else I encountered was excellent.",3,2015,01,09
211,Perfect stay,"Located right across from Croke Park Stadium and within walking distance (if you like strolling down streets) of the city center.
Perfect rooms and an excellent service provided by every member of the staff.",5,2015,01,09
211,Simply amazing,"Stayed at the Croke  Park hotel for two nights in jan and it was a pleasant surprise. since I arrived in dublin early I decided to take the bus just for fun. I recommend this to any one traveling with minimal luggage, it is a 30 mins ride and cost less that 3 Euro. a 10min walk from the drumcondra station, i was told my room was ready despite being early. for once there were no fault at all, the room was spacious, clean and well organized. there were magazines and a guide book with attractions and directions-very helpful. the staff were excellent and informative, my best experience came from housekeeping, came back to my room after a long sightseeing adventure and the room was spotless,by far the best kept hotel i have ever stayed in. there is free wifi and parking, it is a 20 mins walk from the city centre, Croke park station right behind the hotel and an enterprise car rental down the street.it was indeed a fantastic stay, will definitely return this hotel when next I am in dublin",5,2015,01,08
211,"New Year In Dublin and Stayed At The Croke Park, Fantastic Time","Very warm welcome on arrival and we had a great room with plenty of space and it was so clean, large bathroom with a real bath (You don't see many of those nowadays) walk in shower and enough gels, lotions and potions to stay clean. Plenty of plugs and sockets, the broadband was amazingly fast and free, Flat screen TV was on the wall and easy to watch from the king size bed (Very Comfy) Heating can be controlled in the room.

Breakfast choice was really good and only 12 euros each, walked in to Dublin from here, (30 mins) to be fair it's not in the nicest area but we did not feel unsafe or have any problems even late at night.

Bring plenty of money as Dublin aint' cheap, but hey your here to have a good time. Hotel bar was nice and we ate there on our last night as our feet ached and the rain was pouring down, Fish and Chips with some mushy peas, the batter was light and the chips were superb, washed down with a nice though pricey NZ Sauvingon Blanc, 

They ordered our 6am taxi for us back to the airport and everything ran like clockwork, overall fantastic hotel, superb attention to detail, friendly staff with a can do attitude. Would definatly go back.",5,2015,01,08
211,Couldn't fault it!!!,"I stayed at the croke park hotel for my 21st and this hotel helped make it perfect! Everything about the hotel is brilliant I can't fault anything! My dad and partner had previously emailed the hotel making them aware it was my birthday and if there was anything they could do and they went out of there way to give me a surprise on my birthday! The staff are all fantastic, very helpful and always friendly! A special thanks to Anna who sorted some special things for my birthday! :) the location of the hotel is perfect, only about a 10 minute taxi drive away from temple bar and the shops! Taxis are also fast and reliable from the hotel. The food is brilliant, lots to choose from and very tasty. The room service was quick and still to a high standard! :) I would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone and I will be staying here again. Massive thanks to all the staff for making it brilliant!! ",5,2015,01,07
211,Quality hotel,"Stayed at the Croke Park hotel in July 2011 with my friends.  We were impressed with the quality of the hotel, we were also upgraded to the executive lounge area when we checked in (nice touch).  The rooms were very comfortable, quality bedding, good mini bar selection.  We also liked the bar area and the large sofas to sit on by the fire.  

Would definetly stay at this hotel again, reasonable rates aswell.",4,2015,01,07
211,Such a fantastic stay,"I couldn't recommend this hotel more! Everything was perfect from the time we arrived to the time we checked out. When we arrived we went to the front desk where the friendly and informative staff checked us in very speedily! We went to our room on the 3rd floor which was so spacious and well presented. I was beyond impressed when I saw a birthday card and bottle of prosseco on the desk, such a nice touch and I really want to thank the hotel for this! The bed was a good size and was so comfortable. The toilet was clean and extremely spacious and had all the toilitries and towels we needed. The shower was particularly impressive as it was one of these walk in ones, very chic!

We then proceeded downstairs for dinner in the Sideline Restaurant. We ordered off the set menu, and although the choice was a bit limited our meal was delicious and very well presented! We had breakfast on both mornings of our two night stay and were so impressed! There was a huge variety of full irish and continental options and although the restaurant was extremely busy the staff were friendly and attentive!

The next day we wanted to visit a few sights around Dublin and the concierge provided a fantastic service, he was very helpful in advising us how to navigate the transport system. When we returned we decided to dine in the Sideline Bar as my boyfriend was eager to watch a big football match. It was being shown on the huge screen in the bar, the sound was perfect and boyfriend was more than pleased! We ordered off the bar menu which had fantastic variety and the food was gorgeous, I would recommend the burger to all!! Drinks were also a reasonable price and the cocktail menu was impressive!

The next day we sadly had to check out but got to avail of a 2pm late check out which was very handy as our train home wasn't until the evening.

Overall I would rate this stay 10/10, I was beyond impressed and we will be returning again!",5,2015,01,06
211,The Best Hotel in Dublin,"This is the best Hotel in Dublin. We have stayed in this Hotel several times and always have been extremely pleased with every thing.
Will always go back to Croke Park Hotel when ever in Dublin and recommend it to everyone.
              ",5,2015,01,06
211,Perfect,"Stayed at this hotel for 4 days on new years eve, can honestly say that it was a lovely hotel and all the staff where so good! They couldnt do enough for
Us! Room service was real good too as we ordered it on new years day because we was too delicate to dine out from the night before :D my partner ordered the steak sandwich, i dont eat steak but even my mouth was watering! It looked and tasted delicious ;)
Anyway this is a very clean hotel i havent got one bad thing to say except for it to be a little closer to the centre? But it only cost us €10 in a taxi or a 15 min walk? Just a tip as Dublin can be expensive, dont waste your money at temple bar its a extra €4 to €5 per drink! Its just a tourist attraction, its cheaper accross the bridge and just as good. Hope you have as much fun as we did.    ",5,2015,01,05
211,"Beautiful rooms, exceptionally friendly staff","We visited Dublin from 30.12.-4.1. and were very happy with the Hotel. It is approx 10-15 mins away from O'Connell Street which suited us perfectly since we don't mind a little walk.
Rooms were of a decent size, comfortable bed (Superior),.
Staff was exceptionally friendly and very helpful. Stephen, one of the waiters, recommended a tour in the Wicklow mountains, which we went on and had a really great time there.
All in all it was a great stay at a reasonable price.",5,2015,01,05
211,Essence of Comfort,Stayed in this hotel after going to the Panto - family of 2 adults and 2 kids. Very friendly staff and room excellent- beds so comfy and lovely clean modern bathroom. And most of all room was sound proof - we all had a great sleep. The food in the lounge was excellent and good value for Dublin. Will definitely be back again. And its very close to city centre. A very short taxi ride. ,5,2015,01,05
211,Excellent ,"Such a nice hotel and not in a bad spot either. We really enjoyed our stay and the staff were friendly. The room service food was excellent and well priced with massive portions. The rooms were clean, spacious and comfortable. Would recommend to friends and family! Thank you! ",5,2015,01,04
211,Excellent Hotel,"I don't write a review on all hotels I stay in but I just have to review this GEM.  I had my wife and 2 x young children and from the moment we arrived to when we left I could not get over this place, the staff are the best I have ever seen, the children were treated like real guests which is unusual and so welcome.  The food was 5 stars and good value, the service was so friendly and also the car park was free which a lot of Dublin hotels get you for.  On departure they even gave us all bottles of water for the journey home.  I will differently be back and I give this hotel my full recommendation for a great family hotel for your break.",5,2015,01,04
211,Lovely hotel but........,"Stayed here from New Year's Eve for 3 nights.
Positives......
Had just parked the car in front of the hotel on arrival and concierge was at the door within seconds with a trolley to take our cases to our rooms 
Very clean and spacious room with all the toiletries that you require
Had dinner one of the nights in hotel, very well presented, staff were really cheerful, always smiling and attentive
Entertainment was not the best but was easy on the ear

Negatives......
Reception staff should take lessons from the restaurant staff on how treat guests. They weren't rude but not very pleasant either.  Not one of them raised a smile all the time we were checking in/out.

I would have given this hotel 5  had the reception staff treated us in the same way as restaurant staff, but I would certainly stay here again if I was in the vicinity.",4,2015,01,04
211,Excellent hotel with very friendly staff,"Stayed with my partner for 2 nights. Booked with Catherine who was very helpful. Sean, also ensured we were made to feel very welcome. The receptionist Anna was very friendly. Our room on the fourth floor was very clean, spacious and lovely. What is brilliant about Croke Park Hotel is the staff who go out of their way to ensure you enjoy your staff. We stayed on a new year package with a three course dinner which I could not praise enough. The fish and chips was delicious as was the fillet steak. Alma served us and gave us five star attention. In the bar Aishling and Stephen really were very friendly and helpful. Breakfast had plenty of choice and was very good. We got on the hop on, hop off bus which leaves from the hotel and does a tour around the city. A taxi was 7 euros from O'Connell bridge to the Croke Park hotel. I would return to The Croke Park again. I have stayed in plenty of hotels in Dublin but loved our stay here. Thank you to the staff for looking after us so well.",5,2015,01,03
211,Could not fault... fanastic,"We arrived at hotel around 3 hours early for check in and were given a complimentary upgrade to executive suite, room was spotless and very spacious.

Staff were exceptional and could not be more helpful! The complimentary breakfast in the relaxing executive suite was just right for what we were looking for, the only thing that we felt would be good would be a machine to make toast. The selection of fruit, cheeses, ham and pastries were all excellent! 

We did not eat in the restaurant but did order room service from the sideline bistro which arrived quickly and was very good.

The relaxing surroundings in the bar was great, only wish we had spent more time in it.

A bit of a walk from hotel to Temple Bar/ Grafton Street areas of the city but weather was fine and only a short taxi ride to these areas. We enjoyed exploring the city on foot.

Would highly recommend this hotel to anyone and would defo stay again when we return to Dublin. Had a brilliant new year in the city!!",5,2015,01,03
211,New Year 2015,"Stayed here for 2 nights over New Year's Eve. The hotel is one of the best we've stayed in. Check in was nice and easy, hot towels at reception were appreciaed after our flight. The concierge Robert was extermely helpful in handing us details about catching public transport to the races at Fairyhouse the next day. Our room was spacious, clean and comfortable. All the toiletries and extras came in handy in the huge bathroom which had a bath and shower. Received complimentary drinks for both nights which were enjoyed in the huge bar/lounge. Again staff all extremely polite and likeable. Complimentary newspaper too which was a nice touch. Food served both evenings was tasty and in huge portions. It's a 20 min walk to Connolly Station which takes you past nice wee pubs. My only complaint was the lady in charge of breakfast on the 1st who advised us that we weren't booked for breakfast but wouldn't allow me to go and get my paperwork to confirm. A call to reception advised that we were booked for continental and as we were pushed for time to catch the train, we conceded. We were ushered to our seats like we weren't to look at the people enjoying full Irish and wasn't the most pleasant of experiences as she was quite sharp with us. However on arriving back to the hotel that night we found out that we were indeed booked in for full Irish and could have made more out of the fact that we had ""lost"" 10 euros that morning but I was happy with the way the receptionist dealt with my issue. All in all we weren't going to allow this to ruin what was a really enjoyable New Year.",4,2015,01,03
211,Good hotel at a good price. ,"Nice clean hotel, not to far from city center, very friendly helpful staff, good breakfast even though we thought slightly over priced, we went to Candy cafe a couple of times just down the road, at €8 which is half the price, but the evening dinner we had was of good quality & presented well, just the bottle of wine was expensive, but overall a good experience. ",4,2015,01,01
211,Very Impressive Hotel,"As a family of four we found this hotel very clean and warm throughout, Room was spacious and kept to a very high standard. Comfortable bed, plus a large en suite. The bar food was excellent. As was the Breakfast. All the staff where helpful and courteous at all times. This Hotel comes highly recommended by us. ",5,2015,01,01
211,Putting their customers first,"Stayed in the hotel for two days over the Christmas with the family and found it a real hidden gem in Dublin.

Location is within 15 mins walk from the city centre. From check in to leaving the staff were excellent and nothing was too much trouble. We requested a change of room for the kids and it was done with the minimum of fuss.

Rooms were spacious, comfortable and really well maintained.

Breakfast each morning was a relaxing no rush experience with plenty of choice of food and plenty of papers to read while enjoying a leisurely breakfast. Staff extremely attentive and helpful with any requests from the kids.

We ate in the Sideline Bistro the first night and all six cleared their plates. Good quality food at reasonable prices and a good ambience.

Watched a game the second night in the bar and a real relaxed family environment where kids and adults could enjoy the game.  

On check out we were offered bottles of water for the trip home and on check in hot towels.

Hotel should be proud of their staff and their efforts to really put the customer first.",5,2014,12,31
211,Fantastic hotel and great service !!,"The Croke Park Hotel is fantastic place to stay. The staff are very helpful and the rooms are spotless and also extremely comfortable ! 

Got dinner in the restaurant and it was a fantastic meal everything cooked to perfection ! The girlfriend also asked for a cocktail which wasn't on the menu but the bar staff made it for her anyway without any fuss ! 

I would happily recommend this too friends and family just sorry we stayed the one night ! But we will certainly be back 

Thank you  ",5,2014,12,30
211,Absolute Gem,"Loved it, we have stayed twice cannot recommend enough. Great staff, great rooms, great price. The bar is very cosy and relaxing after a day of sight seeing. Haven't eaten here but imagine it would be lovely. We will definitely be back again and again!",5,2014,12,30
211,Fantastic hotel ,"Visited Croke park in December for an event at the 3G arena, was our first time visiting Dublin and my partner picked the hotel as she always seems to find the hidden gems. The hotel is in a great location from the airport on the Airbus first stop on the route and small walk down the road. Orla greeted us she was so friendly and helped us upgrade for a small amount of money and it was totally worth it. She seemed to constantly be on the front desk always remembering us and asking where or what we had done that day. Ian on the breakfast was fantastic at his job and always had a smile on his face. I would 100% revisit this hotel specially at Christmas as it was just beautiful. ",5,2014,12,29
211,"Good value, decent location from Dublin proper","My friend and I stayed at this hotel as a first stop of our Ireland trip. We wanted to stay in Dublin to check out a few must-sees (i.e., Guinness Storehouse). This hotel was a great value and relatively close to the heart of the city. It is a decent 10-15 minute walk to get to the shopping areas and major tour companies staging areas. As solo girls traveling, we felt completely safe in the hotel and in the area around it.  I might suggest a cab if you're out very late or depending in what part of the city you're in. The hotel staff was very helpful in pointing out the not-so-nice areas. We shared a double room which was very spacious. Our room rate included breakfast in the morning which is plenty to keep you going. We didn't take advantage of the hop on/ hop off bus available from the hotel since we preferred walking. We were able to get to Trinity Church, Guinness Storehouse and Jameson Distillery easily enough. We didn't spend a lot of time in the hotel as we were taking tours and checking out the sites. For this reason, we considered it a good value as there was no need to pay more money for a hotel that we weren't going to be spending time in. If you prefer to have easy access to your hotel room throughout the day, this hotel may not be ideal. If you're planning on taking day trips and being away, then this hotel offers a good value with great service.",4,2014,12,29
211,Wonderful surprise.,"Stayed here as part of an Aer Lingus vacation package! What a great place! We drove in from the airport, not far, but my first time driving in Ireland, on the opposite side of the road, and driving into a busy part of Dublin, to boot. We were in the general area, but having a hard time locating the correct turn! Anyway, I just said to my friend, look for the stadium, the hotel is right there! Sure enough, there we found it! The lobby was lovely, the desk staff super efficient and warmly greeted us, answering any questions we had. The room met and exceeded our expectations. The breakfast was fantastic. Nice area in the lounge to relax in, contemporary fireplace warmed it up nicely after a rainy sightseeing day. The only downside was the distance to the center of city activity, but once we got our bearings, we were off via the hop on /hop off bus, and because we came back later that the last bus, we just hailed a taxi, and the fee was very reasonable for a safe trip back. (it will cost you about a ten-er, as our waiter told us at a restaurant in Temple Bar, and it was just a bit over that.) Very accommodating, friendly staff. Would stay here again if in Dublin, and the pricing is good!",5,2014,12,29
211,Pre Christmas treat,"Stayed here for one night early December 2014. Lovely hotel with free parking. We were upgraded to the executive suite with allowed us access to executive lounge. -free drinks.newspapers.breakfast etc. our room was lovely and bed very comfortable. We had breakfast and dinner in hotel. Food and service outstanding. Staff at desk very pleasant and informative. We walked into DUblin which was about 15 mins. 
Would definately stay here again.",5,2014,12,28
211,Excellent Hotel & Staff,"- Our room was clean, modern and spacious (and I can be fussy about hotel rooms but this one was perfect).
- All staff was extremely friendly, helpful and overall very hospitable- one member of staff extended our check out time slightly free of charge as he was aware that our departing flight was late at night. All were happy to help with directions and bus timetables.
- Anything we requested was done so without any issues and very swiftly.
- Located close to the city centre-15 min max walk- when booking I thought this would be an issue as I did hear it was longer but it wasn't, in fact, it was a nice walk to the centre.
- Would certainly recommend to family/friends.
- If we returned to Dublin again, we would stay here again. ",5,2014,12,27
211,"Nice Hotel with great rate, but minor issues","Normally we stay at 3-4 star or better hotels in the U.S., as this is the first time to Europe, I am not sure if this is normal or not. I can only relate to our experience in the states - which is not typical throughout the world I know.

First, the hotel staff was very nice. We arrived early and could not checkin yet. They offered to hold our bags until the room was ready and we could go explore. No problems when we arrived back getting our luggage or checking in. When we got to the room, the room was nice and spacious.

The WiFi worked great.

We had three people in our room. When we arrived, only two towels. We called and extra towels were delivered very quickly. When the room was cleaned a few days later and we replaced the towels, and again only received 2. We called down to have more delivered when we returned that night - got a voice mail and no callback. Called in the am for more towels. An hour and half later, we simply got some from the staff that was cleaning a room down the hall.

The electrical in the bath could not support a hair dryer or straightener. For the females in the group, this was an issue. To make matters worse, the mirror in the room did not have an outlet near it so it was not available to the ""getting ready"" process either. Add to the problem, the lighting in the bath was dim making it difficult to apply their makeup.

The dinning room closed early the only time we attempted to eat there. The menu for room service was very limited. We ordered one item, soup, and it was delivered with the wrong type of soup. It was good, but the wrong the same.

The hotel is not city center. It is directly next to the field, which is about a 20-30 minute walk from the main part of town where we spent most of our time. They do have Hop on Hop Off bus pick up in the morning for us tourist, but after the 945 am pickup, you have to walk to the stop and walk back to the hotel, or hire a taxi. Not a big deal if you are teenagers, but is a problem with younger kids and senior adults. 

If you are going to Dublin with a family, or plan to visit the pubs every evening, i would recommend staying more center. you will pay more, but the walking/cost of a taxi would be worth it. 

If you are a young adult with no younger kids, then this hotel is a great option. The walk is not difficult as long as you know what to expect. The staff was very friendly and the price is extremely competitive.",3,2014,12,26
211,Attention to detail,Welcomed to hotel with hot towels for freshening up.  Concierge took our bags as the room wasn't ready. He recommended that we visit the Christmas market when he heard we were going shopping. When we came back the room was v spacious . It was a family room with 2 double beds and a single. Room was clean with large bathroom and shower. They had even included hot chocolate on the tea/coffee tray! Staff couldn't have been friendlier or more welcoming. On checkout we were given a bottle of water each for our journey home.,5,2014,12,26
211,nice hotel,"Nice hotel and good location close to city centre....... large spacious bedrooms, ....staff are very helpful and friendly. Food in restaurant is excellent, recommend this hotel to anyone going to Dublin",4,2014,12,24
211,Wonderful Experience,"I stayed in this hotel for 1 night with my family. Room  was not ready when we arrived (at 12 so completely  understandable) but we were able to park the car  and check in . We left our bags with the Concierge and had a leisurely stroll  of about 10 minutes into the city center. The Location is fantastic directly across from Croke Park and in a really quiet street.
On our return to the hotel we were welcomed with a complimentary hot chocolate which was a really nice touch. Our room was on the 2nd floor and was really a great size for this family of 4- 2 double beds, lots of storage. The bathroom was big and bright with both  a bath and a shower and lots of toiletries. Room was really quiet though the hotel seemed busy.
The staff are all wonderful but I really have to acknowledge Krishna the Concierge - He was amazing and so helpful. Nothing was too much for him and my kids adored him - he was so kind to them.Thank you for their gorgeous teddies. He offered fantastic advice to us and we were so grateful- really hope the Management realise what an asset he is to the hotel.
We only ate breakfast at the hotel as we were out and about in the city but the choice was brilliant.
We will definitely be returning to this Hotel",5,2014,12,23
211,Nice place,I had my Xmas party in Croke Park last week. I stayed in Croke Park Hotel as it's literally across the road. Staff are nice and seemed like a cosy place to enjoy a pint and relax. It's really handy to stay here if you're planning on attending a concert or GAA match,4,2014,12,22
211,Home from home,"We stayed at Croke Park Hotel with 3 other couples in the lead-up to Christmas and as part of a concert break (Imelda May at the 3 Arena). The bedrooms were great, very spacious  (with extremely large and comfortable beds) and the bathroom was bright, airy and spotlessly clean. The food in the restaurant was delicious and good value and the staff very friendly. The only downside was that the drinks in the bar were overly expensive.  Overall though I would highly recommend Croke Park for a relaxing stay, and its close to the city centre",5,2014,12,22
211,"Top class, ideal location.","Stayed there on a night out. Staff very friendly. Service was great. Rooms very nice.great value for all. Bar was a little expensive.
check in and out was easy. They arranged taxis with no hassle at all. Got a free bottle of ballygowan on checking out. Nice touch was needed.",5,2014,12,21
211,Great friendly Hotel,I stayed here with a friend to attend a family reunion.  The hotel staff were the most helpful and friendly I have come across in a while.  The breakfast was lovely and we had one meal in the evening the day we arrived and it was very enjoyable.  The room we stayed in was very clean and had everything we needed and more.  My only criticism would be that it was out of the city a little and not directly on a bus route as we got ripped off by the taxi when we arrived (€35) on the way back to the airport it was only €16 but otherwise for the time we were there this was not a problem.  I would definitely stay here again on my next visit to Dublin.,5,2014,12,19
211,First two nights in Dublin started out in this REALLY nice hotel !,"I had attended a Bon Jovi concert at Croke Park stadium years back so I knew the neighborhood.
This hotel was perfect in everyway. I arrived early as most do when traveling from the USA.
They offered to store my bags and feed me breakfast before the room was ready. The hop on hop off pulls right up front so we ate and started our adventure immediately. Once we returned our rooms were ready and beautiful decorated and very clean with all the amenities I needed.
Staff all around was outstanding. The bar was warm and welcoming with a VERY large screen TV in a seperate area. I love love love this place ! You will too !",5,2014,12,18
211,"Amazing staff, amazing room, amazing everything!","Amazing hotel, lovely and really helpful staff - I can't praise them enough! They must see tourists day in and day out but they seemed genuinely interested in our stay and gave us lots of recommendations and easy directions. 

They were very proactive in trying to find us an iPod dock when the room states there would be one available (there wasn't) - this was the only downside. There was only a CD player.  

The room was beautifully presented and warm and the bathroom was absolutely spotless. 
The location was perfect for us because even though we weren't visiting the stadium - we could walk to the center in about 15-20 minutes.

The morning that we had to leave we left a message with the receptionist in the evening to order us a taxi to the airport - even though the staff member was different in the morning, they greeted us immediately and told us our taxi was waiting outside in the morning. The concierge even walked us to the car! 

Overall, I would highly recommend this hotel and 100% stay here again. This hotel has really set the bar!",5,2014,12,18
211,Almost perfection!,"Stayed at the Croke Park Hotel 15-18th Decemeber.  Hotel is 10/15 minutes walk from the city centre so is quiet and convenient! Service was impeccable and the staff are extremely friendly and welcoming. However on our second day the cleaning of the room was less than perfect (mugs not changed, floor not cleaned). 
Overall a wonderful, luxurious stay at the Croke Park Hotel, would definitely recommend!  ",5,2014,12,17
211,Super and professional hotel and the staff were very attentive,"My wife and I had the pleasure of staying here when my wife was doing her ACCA exams over in Croke park. The proximity of the hotel to Croke Park was outstanding.
The rooms was beautiful, clean and nicely decorated. The staff were outstanding and looked after our every need and it is the little things like the hot towel on arrival and the bottle of water on departure that sealed the deal.
Also, the breakfast was  wonderful also as was a copy of the paper was a nice little extra too

I truely wonderful stay and looking forward to stay there again

Thanks a million",5,2014,12,15
211,Stay at Croke Park Hotel,This is a fabulous hotel.  Staff are very friendly and efficient and nothing is a problem.   They were so good to our children and we got two beautiful teddies when we checked in which they were delighted with.  Food was excellent and we definitely will stay at this hotel again. ,5,2014,12,15
211,Great hotel experience,"Stayed at Croke Park Hotel on 12th December, 2014.  Very quick registration & hot towels on arrival, friendly staff, lovely room to the front of hotel, we booked a double but there were two doubles quite spacious, spotlessly clean bathroom with plenty of toiletries & face clothes, tea & coffee facilities. I wanted to make some tea but there were no normal tea bags plenty of flavoured teas & coffee, I phoned to reception & tea bags were delivered immediately.
On our return to hotel after 10pm we ordered sandwiches from room service & again delivered very quickly & were extremely good. 
Breakfast was excellent we asked for porridge & it was served beautifully with sliced banana & honey followed by full Irish & toast tea & coffee. Absolutely fabulous stay would highly recommend.",5,2014,12,14
211,"My ""Go Too"" Place","This is the first Hotel I stay at when I land @ Dublin Airport. 
Reception staff are excellent. 
They couldn't have been more accommodating. 
Last time I went, the room assigned was smoky & had noisy neighbours. When this was told to reception, they immediately changed my room. 
My flight always arrives early, but CroakePark is always ready for me. 
I wouldn't want to stay anywhere else!
Great Hotel, thanx!
",5,2014,12,14
211,It's hard to do any better.,"This is my second time to stay at the hotel and it simply gets better, here you have a modern hotel located between the Airport and the City of Dublin with ample of secure parking free for guests.
From your arrival you are greeted by friendly efficient staff at reception who immediately give you a warm refreshing towl as you complete your check in. The rooms are clean and modern and are of a nice size for relaxing which is what you need to do after a long day travelling.
There are other hotels within the area but this is the best of them, you might spend a few Euros more for the accommodation but it's worth every Euro.
Breakfast is really tasty and they have everything you might wish for and again the staff are quick and friendly, the bar serves really good quality food at reasonable prices and then you can relax and watch the massive TV which must be great for the fans of the football.
On departure we were handed bottles of water which is a nice gesture and much appreciated.
All in all a nice stay was had by us and we will happily go back there again and I do hope it's not fully booked as they do quiet well being next door to the stadium.",5,2014,12,13
211,Great hotel!,"Top quality hotel, located directly opposite Croke Park stadium. Staff are friendly and attentive. Rooms are spotless. Really comfortable beds. Would have loved a lie in but work didn't allow it on this visit! Free parking for patrons staying overnight in the hotel.
Well managed top class hotel. Is located near Dublin City centre but wouldn't advise visitors walking around the local area as it's not the safest, especially at night. This is the only downside to an otherwise excellent hotel.",5,2014,12,12
211,Excellent,"Stayed here for 2 nights and it was great value for price. Our big room had 2 double beds and a nice bathroom that came with shampoo, conditioner, body gel and lotion. Room came with complementary tea, coffee, hot chocolate and biscuits and the free wifi was good.The check-in and check-out was very efficient and it takes 20 min to walk to the city centre.",5,2014,12,12
211,great place to stay,"Could not fault this hotel, from its lovely staff to the wonderfull food you cant beat it, the rooms are lovely and we had a great breakfast to set us of for the day only took us 15 min to walk to city centre we cant wait to be back well done.A special thanks to the friendly staff in bar and restaurant.",5,2014,12,11

211,Fab Hotel,We spend a fab night here - staff were very friendly and room was top notch! Right beside the Croke park stadium which hosts concerts world famous musicians and national sports events.  walking distance to town but all many bus routes pass near by.,5,2014,12,10
211,Best hotel on our Ireland trip!,"After two week of traveling with a group of 46 from the United States we found the Croke Park Hotel to be our favorite place.  The rooms are large and very comfortable.  Nice selection of shampoo, lotion, etc in the bathroom.  They even had face clothes for those of us from the U.S.  The restaurant was very good.  The breakfast buffet ranks with some of the best  we have had anywhere.The food is nicely displayed as well as hot and tasty .  Large television area near the bar. The hotel is located close to the Dublin Stadium.  The only drawback is that the area is not the best and it is too far away from any local shopping or entertainment areas.  For a large group we had an excellent experience with check in.  One of our group members hurt her knee and they were quick to make her day very comfortable while the rest of us were touring.  Hats of the a great hotel!!",5,2014,12,10
211,Great hotel,"Great hotel 
Great quite location good place to stay for a short trip to dublin short taxi  ride cost about 9 euros to city center reception staff cold not have been more friendly and helpfull short ride to airport recomend a taxi about 20 euros 
Thanks for a great stay",5,2014,12,10
211,Classy hotel for the price,If you call hotel they can offer good deals. We had it booked for Garth Brooks who of couse didnt turn up. It is just a few steps away from the Stadium. Lovely rooms and restaurant food was fab as was breakfast. Would stay again,4,2014,12,09

211,Fabulous Hotel,"Stayed in The Croke Park hotel for 6 nights as arranged via the ferry company. It proved to be an excellent choice and would thoroughly recommend it to any potential visitor. Situated opposite the stadium it is a 20 minute walk to city centre.

The staff were excellent and exceptionally friendly. The bedroom was spacious, spotlessly clean and extremely comfy.

The hotel bistro proved to be excellent even though the choice was rather limited and very reasonable in value.

Really enjoyed our stay and hopefully will return one day.",5,2014,12,09
211,Best Hotel of our Irish Vacation,"We spent a week in Ireland on CIE Tours Irish Adventure, this was the last hotel used and by far the best. Nice, big, quiet rooms, sparkling clean baths with separate tub and shower. Public area is modern and welcoming.",5,2014,12,09
211,A great hotel,"I recently stayed here to attend a function with work at croke park stadium, great location just across the road. 
From beginning to end I could not fault this hotel, service was fantastic in every department and breakfast was very good. I will definately return. ",5,2014,12,08
211,Great Hotel,"A great hotel, very smart and professional, the rooms are all all of very high standard, and beds very comfortable. Staff also friendly and helpful.
Ate at the bar, and the food was of very good quality",5,2014,12,08
211,Excellent,"I stayed here for two nights in December in an executive room. Very fairly priced. The staff were polite, helpful and keen to ensure you had a good day. The hotel was in a quite part of Dublin, but this might change on match days! A 'Dublin hop on hop off' shuttle bus stopped outside the hotel, and went to the city center. I would definitely stay here again.",5,2014,12,08
211,Classy Croke.,"Lovely hotel across the street from Croke Park and a 15 minute walk from Dublin's city centre.My wife and I stayed there for a weekend 5th/6th December. we were given refreshing warm towels at check in and our room was very spacious.
Every area was spotlessly clean - including the public toilets. Any of the staff we met were efficient and friendly.",4,2014,12,08
211,Great Hotel.,"Stayed last week for one night away on business paying £61 for a superior double room.

The rooms were spotless and well equipped.

The staff were extremely friendly and professional.

I didn't eat there but if you leave the hotel and turn right there is a very nice Italian restaurant about 150 yards on the right.

A cab to the Centre it will cost you around €7-8.

The bar area at the Hotel offered plenty of choice and, unlike many hotels, was reasonably priced.

I'd parked in the car park under the hotel which is free for residents.

Returning to the airport was a piece of cake too and only took about 15 minutes.

It's a brief review but an accurate one and I wouldn't hesitate to recommend it to anyone that needs somewhere really comfortable to stay.",5,2014,12,08
211,One of the best hotels in Dublin,"Recently stayed in the Croke Park Hotel - our 4th visit in 2 years!
Great experience!

From check-in to check-out 10 out of 10 for friendliness, efficiency and welcoming attitude and atmosphere.  We had booked a front facing room which was beautifully spacious and had a huge bathroom and lovely veranda.  Sadly the heating was not working so we had to change rooms - a lovely room but not quite as nice as the first.  However, the staff were very good and we were treated to complimentary breakfast by way of apology.
We dined in the Sideline restaurant on the first night and again, this was a great experience - lovely perfectly seasoned well cooked food so well done to the Chef!  Waiting and bar staff have great communication skills and the atmosphere was very warm and cosy.
Well done and we will be back - hopefully next time our room with the veranda will be heated.",5,2014,12,08
211,Recent Croke Park Hotel Visit,"Although this hotel is spotless clean has some fabulous staff, very friendly and give a nice feel to the place. I was a bit disappointed with our visit, there was a mix up over rooms, taxi pre booked was booked under wrong room number so we were left waiting. Found the breakfast expensive and not very warm (maybe we were just unlucky) but overall I would recommend this hotel. ",3,2014,12,08
211,Great memories of Croke Park,"Stayed in this hotel last weekend with family for a  university open day. It proved a brilliant experience. Check in was easy and our rooms on the fourth floor were well appointed and most comfortable. Staff here at all levels are exceptionally efficient and friendly. We dined in the Sideline bistro and had dinner menu which, though limited, ensured that  all four were happy with our choices. There was a most convivial atmosphere in the bar which had live music. Breakfast was top quality with impressive variety. The hotel was well filled with residents from many countries which gave it a real cosmopolitan feel. The hotel has free car parking but for only $10 we took a taxi to the city centre. There is a frequent bus service from nearby Drumcondra Road. Next time we go to Dublin, we will use this hotel __hopefully very soon!",5,2014,12,07
211,Nice hotel.,"Chose this hotel based on the great stay we had in their sister hotel, The River Lee Cork. Nice room on third floor. Comfortable bed. Very clean room and bathroom. Great wifi. Great breakfast. 
What let us down for us was check in. The staff were polite but lacked the friendliness and welcome of the River Lee. However the girl that checked us out, Anna was very friendly and helpful. We also found the bar lacked atmosphere and the table was dirty. But we received great service from Ian, the bar man. Staff at breakfast were great as was the food.
Would we stay here again....yes!!",4,2014,12,06
211,Very nice!,"We stayed at the Croke Park for 3 nights in November, 2014.  The hotel is about a 20 minute walk from city center, but it's worth the walk.  I believe we paid for 2 nights and got the third night free.  The rooms are a little older, but very clean and very accommodating.  I did get an executive room with a king size bed and it was very comfortable ... no problems at all with noise either.  The staff at the Croke Park couldn't have been nicer and were there to answer all our travel questions and guide us through Dublin.  I would definitely recommend this hotel!",5,2014,12,06
211,"Excellent Hotel, poor breakfast.","Great location for my work good room as a person with health prob bath difficult to get out of but is only minor. Reception very help great value for money
Breakfast poor eggs and sausages bad eggs on buffet were terrible and sausages poor, bacon great toast was so thin not great, could do better. Generally this hotel is great look at breakfast though.Fergus",5,2014,12,04
211,You will not be disappointed ,"Short and sweet - Stayed here for 2 days. Lovely and luxurious. Not overpriced for what you get. Upgrade to executive rooms is worth every penny.

All staff we met were polite and helpful and really keen to ensure you had a good day.

We will definitely visit Dublin again and would definitely stay here.

Thanks to all the team at Croke Park, you are a credit to your industry.",5,2014,12,04
211,"Nice hotel, okay location","This was a nice hotel.  The bathroom was huge and the room furnishings were nice, though simple.  The location was okay.  We could easily walk to the city center, but honestly didn't really like making the walk home at night because the neighborhood was somewhat questionable.  The area might very well be safe, but it just didn't feel that way, so we opted for a cab at times.  I would probably try to stay closer to the city if I returned.  However, if you are visiting for a GAA game, the location can't be beat!",4,2014,12,03
211,Comfort & Joy,"2nd trip to Dublin & had no hesitation booking this hotel once again. Arrived off flight at 830am asked to store cases & our room was ready. Massive family room & extremely comfortable. We had exclusive access to executive lounge on 3rd floor with free water/tea/coffee & fruit & cakes with lovely comfortable sofas. The same applies to the sideline bar & history  big comfy chairs & sofas. Great selection of drinks & wide range of eating options. Tour bus stops outside (just check times) but easy walk from Quinn's pub bus stop & train station. 15min brisk walk into O'Connell st. Delightful visits & all staff are a credit - always so helpful, nothing is ever any trouble & customers all seem so relaxed and happy too. Definitely be back over soon.",5,2014,12,03
211,Totally adequate for a city stay,"all the BnBs I tried to book on late notice were full, and Croke Park had a room for us. The rooms were nice, comfortable and clean. There was a large event at the Stadium when we arrived, but we turned our car into Enterprise, literally a half block away (we did not plan this), and walked to the hotel. The lobby and public spaces were over-run with stadium-goers, but we checked in easily, then went off to explore. Concierge directed us to a bus stop about 6-8 minute walk, and we successfully explored Dublin for a couple days. On our last night, we were able to dine (event was over) and the staff and food was good in the hotel restaurant. No problem to get an early taxi to the airport, this was a reasonable, convenient hotel.",3,2014,12,02
211,Top notch,"Excellent place to stay, top notch service and only a 10 min stroll to the centre. Who could ask for more? 
When I return to Dublin I will without doubt be staying here again, can't recommend it enough.",5,2014,12,02
211,Friendly & comfortable,We stayed at the Croke Park Hotel for 3 nights and thoroughly enjoyed it. All the staff were so friendly and welcoming and nothing was too much trouble for them. The bedroom was very clean and comfortable. The breakfast selection was great as was the food in the Sideline Bar. We have stayed there a few times now and would not hesitate in recommending it to family & friends. It's also in a great location for visiting all the sights around Dublin and for transport links to the airport and the M50 motorway. Will definitely be going back on our next visit to Dublin.  ,5,2014,12,02
211,Gem of a hotel - loved it!,"Spent 4 days with the family (2 adults, 2 children) here late November.  We were visiting family.  Can't say enough about how perfect the hotel was for our stay.
Room 2 double beds- facing the Croke Park stadium - was really well appointed and ultra clean.
Front desk staff were very good. All of the other staff - in the restaurants, security, concierge, housekeeping - were fantastic.  
We dined three nights out of four at the restaurant and found the food and service to be extraordinarily good.
The hotel is a 30 minute walk from downtown.  Knowing the area it was a breeze to get to O'Connell street. 
Ample underground parking. 
We got a really good room rate through American Express travel - but I would stay there even if the rate was higher.
And free wifi!",5,2014,12,02
211,All you could ask for,"Can't fault the hotel at all. Decent size rooms. Clean sheets and bed etc, free WiFi, nice breakfast, and friendly helpful staff.

15-20 minute walk from city centre. The only negative is the area immediately surrounding the hotel is a little run down.

The hotel itself aesthetically is excellent however and I didn't let that small issue put me off.",5,2014,12,01
211,"Good Hotel, Great Staff, Dodgy Location","I recently stayed at the Croke Park Hotel over The Week of Thanksgiving for 6 nights.  We arrived at 800 AM and were allowed to check in despite being so early.  Our room was nice and pretty spacious!  The bed was not the most comfortable and the hole in the bedding didn’t help either.  The staff was phenomenal, everyone from reception to the concierge, to the housekeeping staff and the Sideline Bar Staff were very friendly and professional!  
The Hotel is about a fifteen minute walk from the heart of the city.  It is safe to walk by day, but not recommended by night, by anyone!  Despite being 6’5” and 300 lbs., everyone suggested I just take the 7 Euro cab ride back to the hotel every night!  The Dublin cabbies are all friendly and funny as hell!
The complimentary Wi-Fi came in quite handy with figuring out DART and Irish Rail train schedules for our various day trips.  I would recommend the Croke Park Hotel to anyone looking for a decent place to stay in Dublin, thought there are other hotels like the Gresham that are more centrally located!",4,2014,11,30
211,Great stay,"Greeted by lovely receptionist and warm towels all very welcoming. Rooms were lovely, nothing g was left out. Didn't eat in hotel, had a few drinks bar staff couldn't have been nicer. No problem with car park tickets were   validated anytime we wanted to come and  go. We were even given bothers if water on our departure for our journey home. Have stayed in a lot of hotels across Europe and this is most certainly the best. Well done. ",5,2014,11,30
211,Great hotel highly recommend ,We stayed here from 27th Nov to 30th Nov what a fantastic hotel spotless rooms very comfortable beds pillows are great staff very friendly and efficient  will definitely return well done croke park hotel how a hotel should be.,5,2014,11,30
211,Great modern hotel in Dublin,"Stayed here for a hurling match across the street at Croke Park. Then we stayed again after a short visit to Northern Ireland. 
This is a very nice modern hotel with an exceptionally nice and accommodating staff! The breakfast each day was very good with lots of choices.
The hotel bar was very nice with a gigantic tv screen and fireplace.
The rooms were very clean and well appointed.
The location is of course excellent if you're attending events at Croke Park and the tourist attractions of Dublin are a short cab ride away.
I would definitely stay here again when in Dublin.",4,2014,11,29
211,Great hotel near City. Most comfortable beds ever slept on.,Airy clean modern and great staff. Stayed over night as had a work event in Dublin next day early. Had dinner which was excellent and good value. Nice lounge area too. Beds are the best I've ever stayed in any hotel. Attention to detail is brilliant. I've booked again for a family nite in Dublin and couldn't believe when I was asked were any of our family allergic to duck down and said they would make up the room with hallow fibre duvets instead. Thats brilliant service. Would def recommend. ,5,2014,11,28
211,So kind,We had booked to stay here in November. Unfortunately we had a family bereavement and had to cancel. This hotel had no problems refunding our payment once they knew. We had thought to get a credit note because we really wanted to go. Once our family are back to feeling right we will most certainly go and I will treat them to a big box of chocolates. We met some people on holiday in Agadir and they said it was a wonderful hotel! I know we will say the same.,5,2014,11,27
211,Fab Hotel,"Had a two night stay in this hotel 24th and 25th November. Very impressed. Although the surrounding area is a bit drab, the hotel is beautiful. Staff were friendly and chatty, bar food was lovely (arrival of food a bit slow, but well worth waiting for. And it was quite busy while we were there), room was immaculately clean and facilities excellent, although a bit on the small side and was slightly disappointed with bed as it was a bit on the small side too. Also there was a train track outside our window which wasn't great, but noise level wasn't that bad really. We got a good deal on a hotel website and I guess you get what you pay for. This would not put me off returning to this hotel again but would book directly with hotel next time. Would definitely recommend a stay and it is within walking distance of the city centre (about 20 minutes at a brisk pace).",5,2014,11,27
211,Wonderful hotel with friendly staff,"Stayed here overnight when in Dublin for a concert in the 3 Arena.  Have to say the hotel was a excellent choice and was excellent value for the stay.  We received a warm welcome on arrival and went about getting some food in the hotel bar.  The food was very good and I would recommend the scampi basket.  It was a short trip by taxi to the concert but well worth it as this hotel was so much better value compared to others closer to the venue.  The hotel was spotless and the rooms were very spacious, to have both a bath and a separate shower in a hotel room is a nice option as most only have one.  Another great thing about this hotel is the free parking, no fees which is great as most hotels in Dublin charge a minimum of €10.  After this visit here we will definitely be using this hotel again when staying in Dublin.  Again on departure the friendliness of the staff at reception was excellent and management should be proud to have such staff working there.",5,2014,11,26
211,Great Hotel with a warm welcome,My third visit so that says it all. Rooms are spacious and comfortable. In room safe etc. Staff are very friendly and welcoming. Around 10 minutes walk from O'Connell street so you can leave your car in the free Car Park in the hotel. (Another bonus especially in Dublin),5,2014,11,25
211,Spotless,"The hotel staff are friendly and helpful and the hotel is very modern and nicely presented. The rooms are huge, have all the amenities you'd expect, are very nicely decorated and are spotlessly clean. The beds are also massive and very comfy and the hotel is quiet so you can guarantee a good night's sleep. 

The location is great if you want to go to Croke Park but is a 20 min walk from the centre so could be more convenient. Great hotel though. ",5,2014,11,25
211,"Croke Park Hotel, Dublin - worth a visit!","Lovely hotel, spotless, great facilities and really spacious rooms.
Staff lovely, could not be more helpful.
Food fabulous - and thats just the bar. 
Location on northside of city - different and easy accessible.",5,2014,11,25
211,Dublin hospitality at its best,"A top class welcome and an even better service. The food was great and the facilities second to none. The weekend deal was a bargain, and whilst the location is a litte way from the centre of town transport was fast and cheap.
A well worth a return visit.",4,2014,11,25
211,Excellent!,"We loved this hotel. Friendly,  professional staff in all aspects of service. Excellent food, from breakfast (charged separately but well worth it) right through to dinner, whether having a snack in the bar or treating yourself to a meal in the restaurant. An atmosphere of comfort, but you can dress casually or formally to suit your mood. Cocktails in the bar served by the lovely Aisling, her efficient friendly service really made our evenings so enjoyable,  she is a credit to this hotel!! Wifi also superb and inclusive. Will definitely stay here for our next Dublin trip.",5,2014,11,25
211,Short break in Dublin,"Excellent hotel, staff very good. Reception, rooms, food all excellent. Just returned from 3 nights in November, can't wait to go back. 15 walk to the centre, which we enjoy. We will definitely return again.",5,2014,11,25
211,croke park dublin,"The staff is very friendly -the rooms are spacious,very clean with good beds. and a complimentary tea tray - nice breakfast : a very good hotel
the only minor  is the location which is a bit far from city center
              ",4,2014,11,25
211,Birthday Break ,"We were happy to get a 3 night stay in an executive room for my birthday. The room & bathroom were so clean & you get a dressing gown that fitted me!! & slippers.

There is an executive lounge on the floor with free fruit biscuits coffee & bottles of water.

Breakfast is buffet style & was very good I loved the Irish sausages the bacon eggs & mushrooms.

As it was my birthday there was free sparkling wine in the room & also we were given 3 x tickets for 2 free drinks.

The staff are really good & go out of their way to make sure you are having a great stay.

This is the 3rd Doyle Collection Hotel In Ireland I have stayed the others being The Westbury in Dublin & the River Lee in Cork. This was right up there with these 2.",5,2014,11,24
211,Uncomfortable Linen,"First off, I will say that it is a gorgeous hotel with friendly helpful staff and nice food (we had breakfast and some room service delivered). 

But I couldn't help but feel disgruntled when we went to sleep at night. My boyfriend and I stayed there last weekend for the convention in the stadium. When we went to bed at night, I was very disappointed to see that our duvet was little more than a sheet. It's very cold in these days of winter and even with the thermostat turned up to the max, I was freezing in the room while trying to sleep (I'm just lucky I brought woolly pyjamas with me). As well as that, the pillows seemed to have a 'sinking' feeling to them - comparable to a bean bag - which was so uncomfortable that I rested my head on the cushion left on the bed instead of the pillows while my boyfriend used two pillows to compensate.

At nearly 300 euro for our weekend stay, I expected to at least have a warm bed to sleep in. Is that luxury? As such, I didn't get much sleep over the weekend. I've stayed in much more comfortable b&b's. 

Lastly, I would like to mention the annoyance of using one's room key to access the elevator. While I understand the security measure behind it, it was quite finicky and difficult to operate and we often ended up going up and down the hotel before finally landing on the correct floor. One of our keys even stopped working during our stay, locking us out. 

The linen was the biggest issue to me, otherwise a fair hotel.

K O'Flaherty",2,2014,11,24
211,Good if you like to walk :-),"I booked here 'cause they have a nice-ish gym. It was not needed, being at least a 20 minute walk from anything worthwhile in Dublin, I got plenty of exercise walking. It's a nice hotel though,Free wifi (pocks on hotels that don't offer free wifi) a nice vibey bar, ok restaurant, nice amenities. Right next to Croke Park stadium. So either you're a GAA fan, or you don't mind a walk. Or you are happy to pay taxi fares. I liked it, but its not central and the surrounding area is boring. ",4,2014,11,24
211,Ideal!!!!,"This hotel has it all. Easy access, excellent staff and the little added touches that make you feel good. Upon arrival we were given heated towels to freshen up, while we were checked in by helpful and efficient staff. Our room was spacious and well laid out, with everything you could need. On checking out we were again treated in the same helpful and efficient manner and received a complimentary bottle of still water for our journey. All in all a very pleasant and relaxing stay. ",5,2014,11,24
211,Weekend break,"We stayed here from 15th to 17th November and can't recommend it highly enough.  Everything was perfect!  All the staff were brilliant, even hot towels at reception when we walked in a bit chilly from a walk around Dublin!!  The rooms were beautiful and very comfortable.  The food was amazing.  Mum had a problem with her room card and the next thing there were vouchers under the door for a free cocktail at the bar!  We used the green hop on hop off bus to get around.  All in all a great weekend!  Thank You!!!",5,2014,11,24
211,"A great hotel, a little outside the center","During a well visited conference in Dublin many hotels were fully booked. We (a group of business men) stayed in this hotel. The hotel is opposite of Croke Park stadium. So the views are not great. But the inside of the hotel and its services make up for that. Contemporary. Nice, friendly and service oriented staff. Great food in restaurant. Nice and well visited bar area, where one can get food too. And the rooms were just good business standard. Wi-Fi. Flat-screen. Bath and shower. Great beds, I slept really well. Trick of the mini bar: you need to give your credit card details, otherwise door would not open. All in all: recommended. Though near the centre of Dublin not walking distance from centre (unless you walk often).",5,2014,11,24
211,Couldn't fault it,"We stayed here for 4 nights and were very impressed. The staff are welcoming and helpful, the rooms are very comfortable with a sleek modern bathroom. There was no outside noise and we slept very well. The breakfast was fantastic - lots of choice, and if you wanted anything extra you just have to ask. 
We also had access to the Executive Lounge and a complimentary drink each night, which was a lovely surprise.
The hotel is slightly out of the centre of town, but that suited us. You can easily get taxis into town just by asking reception to order one for you, usually the car would be ready within 5mins.
We had dinner in the restaurant one evening and the food was tasty - proper Irish-sized portions. Definitely recommend.",5,2014,11,24
211,"Nice rooms, great service, and great value","This is one of the best hotels I've stayed at in terms of comfort, service and value for money.  The location is a little bit out from the centre, but everything else more than makes up for that. Even if you added on the cost of a couple of taxis, you would still be better off staying here than in one of the more centrally located hotels.  If you're fit enough and it's not raining, it's a pleasant 20 minute walk down to O'Connell Street.  If you're driving into Dublin, the free parking is also a huge bonus.  

The staff were very friendly and helpful, the room was very comfortable and it had all the amenities you would expect for a four-star hotel. 

I would not hesitate to stay at this hotel the next time I visit Dublin and could not recommend it highly enough.",5,2014,11,24
211,amazing value for service,"One of the best and for sure great value for service.  
+ Clean and fairly modern specially within Dublin 4 stars standards.  
+ Highly recommended for business trips.
+ I would suggest this place over many 4 stars B&B or self service apartments in the neighborhood. 
+ Staff were quiet friendly.
- Breakfast was overpriced.",4,2014,11,24
211,Excellent,"Stayed with family for three nights, A beautiful and modern hotel. All the staff are very friendly through out the hotel. A taxi  for five will cost you around 14 euro into temple bar at night. The green hop on hop off bus goes to this hotel which is great for sight seeing . Hotel has  the conceriege  who is great if you have any questions . The rooms are very clean and if you want a balcony room 268 is great. Breakfast is really good. Would use this hotel again for a great break .",5,2014,11,23

211,Excellent stay - highly recommended,"Stayed here for a long weekend with friends of ours. We booked because of the great reviews and the bargain price we got. Rooms were a good size with all amenties and we slept really well. Breakfast had a good selection, staff were all helpful and informative. In short - excellent hotel and we recommend highly. Would definitely return. P.S taxi from airport between €16-€20. Walk into town about 15-20 mins.",5,2014,11,22
211,Ticks the boxes,"A great hotel with modern, clean and comfortable spacious rooms, pleasant staff and a good atmosphere generally throughout the hotel. Not dead centre to the city centre like some hotels but competitively priced.",4,2014,11,20
211,Excellent Service at Croke Park,"Stayed here for a birthday city break with my daughter. We were upgraded to a lovely room.The staff and service were first class from start to finish. Everything was of a very high standard and immaculate. Breakfasts were very good with a wide choice. Would stay here again without hesitation, well done to all the staff you are doing a great job.",5,2014,11,20
211,Recommended Hotel,"We have stayed in The Croke Park Hotel on several occasions and always find the service, cleanliness, food and welcome to be very good. Secure onsite parking is available in the underground car park. Easily accessible to the city centre and yet away from the noise of the city.   
We look forward to returning soon.",5,2014,11,20
211,A nice clean comfy hotel,"This hotel is clean, comfy with spacious rooms. We were greeted by a friendly receptionist and quickly checked in and into our room.  We had a room on the fourth floor that allowed us to use the lounge throughout the day (any time really day or night) which is a great idea.
We had a room that had an adjoining door to the next room which caused a problem on our 2nd night due to a family with young children moving in that day.  It was really noisy when we arrived back at 11pm and we asked to be moved.  This request was dealt with really quickly and professionally and we was given a room on the third floor which was as equally spacious and comfy.
The only disappointment about our visit to the Croke Park Hotel was regarding our breakfast.  When we checked in they hadn't had included breakfast even though it was included in the price we paid.  On the next two mornings when we went for breakfast they would ask if we wanted to pay for breakfast or upgrade from a continental which was frustrating and embarrassing having to wait for our booking to be checked.  After going through the same thing during check in and having clarified breakfast in our booking I would have thought this enough to go without being questioned each morning.
The hotel is not in the city centre but is very easy to walk there and back if needed.  We would walk in during the day and get a taxi back if it was at night.  Taxi would cost approx 6/8 euro depending on where in the city you left from.
Overall a very good hotel with friendly staff and good value.",4,2014,11,19
211,absolutely fantastic,"The croke park hotel has become our Dublin home for the annual pilgrimage down for the autumn tests matches.

Always a warm welcome; immaculate rooms and excellent bar service make this hotel the best.

The location is just right .Simply first class.",5,2014,11,19
211,Proud to take family/friends,"As part of a birthday (gift) trip to Dublin, I booked this hotel for a couple of nights. A delightful experience was had by all.The rooms were spotless and spacious. The staff (from front desk to dining) was very well presented, friendly, and helpful. The breakfast, which included a great selection of cereals, fresh fruit, and hot food, was delicious. We also enjoyed dinner in the bar - good food, great value. We will definitely visit again. Staying at this hotel is worth the minor inconvenience of not being in the city center.",5,2014,11,19
211,Wonderful,"My husband and I were given a trip to Ireland by our children which included a car. Our 1st. night was booked at the Croke Park Hotel and the other 6 were at B&B's throughout Ireland.Upon arriving at the hotel my husband and I were concerned with driving around unfamiliar countyside.After verbalizing our concerns, Mr.Krishna Kumar Deputy Head Concierge at the Croke truly guided us. Mr. Kumar assisted us with tours and sights of   Ireland. We decided to stay the entire trip at the Croke and spent most of the evenings dining there.(the Salmon is superb).Not only was our stay wonderful but we are forever greatful to Mr.Krishna Kumar.My husband and I are already discussing traveling to Ireland next year with our son and his wife and will stay at the Croke Park Hotel.",5,2014,11,18
211,Great hotel,"Just back from a weekend stay. We arrived and got checked it quickly. Room was clean with a double and a single bed.
Bathroom spotless
Breakfast was superb, full Irish fry with as much as you could eat. Coffee and tea on request.

If you are looking for a hotel in Dublin this is the best.",5,2014,11,17
211,Fantastic,"Stayed for 3 nights in November. I honestly don't know where to begin, this hotel is absolutely amazing. Rooms clean and comfortable, staff extremely helpful and friendly, food in the restaurant brilliant, and they have some very good wine in the bar downstairs, which by the way, looks amazing. I was very pleased with all the effort they put in making my boyfriend's birthday as nice as possible. I must say, upgrade to a better room and a bottle of prosecco, along with a birthday card for him - they did well. I will definitely be back, and recommend to everyone.",5,2014,11,17
211,Great little 4* hotel,"Just returned after a 4 night stay. It's a great hotel and puts other places in Europe to shame who say they are 4*. Very spacious bedroom and bathroom with everything you need, great staff and the food in the sideline bar is recommended too. 

It's a little far out from Dublin City centre but you can easily overcome this using the local buses or use the tourist hop on and off buses. Even get a free transfer outside the hotel in the mornings to the city centre if you use the hop on bus which is around 19 euros for two days and recommended. 

Warning about drinking in Temple bar though as I found this completely overpriced but have one for the experience though.

Overall I highly recommend the Croke Park hotel and hope to return again in the future. Thanks for a pleasant stay :-)",5,2014,11,17
211,Great experience,This was my first time to stay here and I will definitely go back. We were going to a concert in the 3arena and booked a B&B package which included a free drink in the hotel bar as well as a transfer to the concert venue.The staff were very friendly at reception and in the bar/restaurant. Room was really spacious and the bed was so comfortable. Plenty of parking underground and it's free for guests. Will be recommending this hotel in the future.,5,2014,11,17
211,Relaxing in Dublin,"I would highly recommend a stay at the Croke Park hotel. I've stayed at many hotels in the city over the last 5-6 years and this was the best, most relaxing atmosphere. 
The hotel is in excellent presentation, the staff is a fantastic, the food was delicious.
The location is ideal for people who know their way around the city and would like to be walking distance from the centre but away from the noise of the town. And it's great distance from and to the airport.
I'm very much looking forward to my next stay",5,2014,11,17
211,Such a great place to stay! ,The room we stayed in was so nice!! Very big for European hotel. Beds are like sleeping on clouds. The staff was amazing. Exactly what we needed after a long and crazy tour of Europe. We would like to go back here when there are events going on in the Park across the street,5,2014,11,16
211,Pleasantly surprised,"Used this hotel for a business meeting over 2 days. Hired a conference room for 2 days, dinner one night for 12, two lunches for 12 plus 10 rooms overnight for delegates. All told no complaints about anything .... 

If this location suits your purpose this is a good hotel. The view around the hotel is awful because it's so close to the stadium you can see nothing but the concrete of the stadium. Some areas about a kilometre from the stadium are less than desirable and on a match day the area is a traffic disaster and the hotel is inundated by fans.... Not a place for the faint of heart on match days. BUT outside match days in this area it's the best hotel around, and stands comparison with all but the most high end hotels.
",4,2014,11,16
211,Croke Park Hotel,"very nice place to stay, walk to attractions a bit long but very doable, not sure of the value as we booked through an agency as a driving tour through Ireland, but overall price of trip was exceptional

211,A hotel that get's everything right!,"This was my first time to stay in the Croke Park Hotel and I was very impressed with everything about it. Lovely decor, excellent comfortable and clean rooms. lots of space. The staff were the best that I have come across in a long time. Very friendly, helpful and general concerned about the welfare of their guests. The hotel has plenty of convenient parking and it's free. 
My only regret was that this was a short business trip and I didn't get to experience it for a little longer.",5,2014,11,14
211,Liaison difficulties in Reception,"Restaurant were not informed of our booking for dinner, neither did we get the birthday cake, ordered for my husband's birthday.  Instead a piece of cheesecake with 4 spoons, really not good enough.
Then our taxi to take us to the airport had not been ordered, so we had to wait a little while.",3,2014,11,14
211,Excellent!,"Thoroughly enjoyed a recent stay here. Booked mainly on basis of price and our stay exceeded all expectations - excellent value deal considering continental breakfast was included via our 4th floor executive lounge and parking was complimentary. 
All staff encountered were friendly and helpful, the hotel rooms were finished to a high standard. Wouldn't hesitate to stay here again. ",5,2014,11,12
211,top hotel,"Stayed for a night whilst watching the rugby,the hotel is about 15 min walk from the city centre or about 8 Euro in a taxi ,check in was efficient and friendly,the room was very spacious with comfortable beds and a fairly large bathroom.Breakfast was excellent with good choices and perfectly cooked for a buffet breakfast,food in the sideline bistro was 1st class .All staff were first class and would thoroughly recommend this hotel for anybody as it has free parking and free WiFi throughout the hotel",5,2014,11,11
211,Value for money,"I had a great stay found via Momondo.com with breakfast and everything at a very reasonable price. The hotel is not really close to anything, but I didn't mind the walk. The rooms were very clean and nice, and I felt very relaxed at the hotel. Good breakfast, good croissants and lots of nutella!",5,2014,11,11
211,Average overall,"I stayed here recently with work for a conference.

All the public areas are really nice. very modern and trendy and nice area to relax. The bar is especially nice and cosy. 

The rooms are fine. Nothing at all special. the double bed was on the small side and the single bed in my room moved with even the slightest touch which was inconvenient. The bathroom was lovely and i liked that it had a separate shower, but the water was tepid at best. 

There was a decent selection at breakfast and staff were friendly and eager to please. Nothing was too much to ask.  

The staff at reception were a bit unfriendly and the card reader in the lift rarely worked which was very frustrating.",3,2014,11,10
211,Excellent Hotel,Got a good deal on a flights and hotel package to stay here.  Dont let the location put you off.  i knew it was a 20 min walk into Dublin centre when i booked it and yes its a bit of a walk but its a straight one so you can't get lost!!  Taxi cost us 8 euro to get back from Temple Bar of a night.  We hopped on a shuttle bus from the airport and it was a 5 min walk from where it dropped us off.  Taxi back to the airport was about 22 euros.   Staff are lovely (we were greeted by Philip).  Very helpful.  The room was amazingly spacious and nicely presented.  Dont expect a view though.  The bathroom had been sparkled within an inch of its life. it was so polished that i felt like i was making a mess if i touched anything chrome!  The shower was great and there was plenty of shower gell etc so dont take your own.  Very comfy bed. Breakfast was lovely.  Plenty to choose from whether it be full Irish or cereals etc.  i didnt have a main evening meal at the hotel but the prices seemed reasonable and there was a good choice.  just dont let the location put you off as the hotel more than makes up for it.,5,2014,11,10
211,Croke Park Hotel,"Whilst a 15 minute walk from the centre, the Croke Park Hotel is spotlessly clean and the service excellent and the walk into the centre isn't a core at all! Plus there are endless taxis if you are feeling lazy.",5,2014,11,10
211,Croke park hotel,"Very good hotel, clean and modern rooms. The lounge area is fantastic with couches and a good selection of drinks on tap. Free parking below the hotel which is great! The staff were all very friendly. Only negative thing is that it's a bit out of the centre of town and you need to catch a taxi to get to the main areas. Would recommend it to anyone.",4,2014,11,09
211,executive lounge what a treat,"we stayed at croke park hotel between 26-28th October 14 after booking via secret escapes
we arrived earlier than expected but this wasn,t a problem and we were able to access our room at 1.30pm.

The key cards for your room only access the floor on which you are staying both in the lift and stairs so we felt very secure.

we were allocated a room on the fourth floor which had a large shower , adequate bath and lovely soft bed with lovely bedding/pillows etc so we were off to a good start.

we were told we could also use the executive lounge which had a excellent coffee machine, fresh juices/fruits and more, especially in the mornings where we could also have smoked salmon, cheeseboard, pastries, cereals etc - this was a lovely touch and not expected based on the very good rate we paid.

We slept soundly both nights and heard no other noise from other rooms or from the corridor/outside areas - there was a handy ice machine at the end of the corridor which was great for a night cap.

Every member of staff acknowledged us and nothing seemed too much of an effort - giving access to computers and printers was really handy ref printing boarding passes for check in and this was a free service as was the bicycle hire that we didn,t actually see until we were checking out,

Other reviews mention the distance to town, well its 15 mins walking briskly - we,d purchased a 30 euro bus pass each at the airport which included airport transfer any bus and the touring hop on and off bus which croke park is one of the stops - where can you travel for 3 days as many times as you want for £25 pounds a head especially as airport return was £7 anyway and if you want a laugh some of the drivers on the tour buses had us in stitches with their humour.

We had Guinness factory passes too incl  - really glad we didn,t pay for them as my other review will mention, over priced, bit boring as mostly visual effects with audio commentary - having said that views from the top of the storehouse were amazing and my husband enjoyed his free Guinness and mine!

After a lot of walking we chilled out on the final morning and again pleasantly  surprised that check out was 12.00pm and not the norm 10.00/10.30

Overall loved the hotel, would definitely stay there again and would happily book the fourth floor again.",5,2014,11,09
211,Its the small things that count,"Excellent hotel where the friendly staff really know how to look after you. Hot towels on arrival, umbrella offered when raining, water offered when leaving, free use of the executive lounge offered when asked about possibility of upgrade, free taxi into town when scheduled shuttle unavailable.
Large room, large bathroom with bath and separate large shower.
Would definitely use again.
Although not central, frequent bus routes from airport and to city centre only 6/7 minutes walk away. (Get a LEAP Visitor Card for 19.50 euros at the airport - gives 72 hours bus / DART /LUAS tram journeys throughout Dublin and farther afield, such as Howth, so no real need for expensive taxis)",5,2014,11,09
211,Absolute great!,"I stayed in the Hotel for one night in October with my girlfriend and booked one of their Special offers.
We arrived very early due to an early arrival in Dublin. Unfortunately  our was room not available at that time so we got a free upgrade.
The room was very spacious and the beds comfortable.
We didn't get to try the breakfast buffet but ordered room Service instead.
Everything was delicious and the staff really friendly.
Just a bit far away from the City centre but it's only about 10€ with a Taxi, so really affordable.
Really highly recommend that Hotel!",5,2014,11,09
211,"Service excellent, above and beyond all expectations.","I was staying overnight in the Croke Park hotel on Friday 7th of November. I was sharing with my daughter and 13month grandson who had asked me to babysit while she joined the graduates of her MBSc class who had received their Masters honours that day. My grandson had been unwell that day but settled to sleep easily and as his mum was only going to be out an hour I encouraged her to go.
About an hour later disaster struck and he woke with a scream. His temperature has risen sharply and he started to convulse. I was in shock but I rang reception for help and to call an ambulance.
The staff was excellent, rushing straight to my room, Pasqale took over from me and tended to the baby, keeping him on his side and making sure he was breathing . It was wonderful to be able to rely on someone who had training. Gary the night manager brought the ambulance men straight up and attended them, bringing tepid towels while they tried to reduce the baby's temp. After going straight to the national children's hospital the staff  continued to ring my daughter to get her to the hospital. Later they rang me to ask if they could send anything to us, if we needed anything or money as we rushed out. Later they rang me to know if they could send us anything, clothes, food or even money. I cannot express how grateful we are to the staff and how concerned they were for our welfare. A few hours later I returned to the hotel to get a couple of hours sleep while my daughter stayed at the baby's bedside. I was greeted at reception and again Gary personally brought me up to the room and opened it for me, he offered to send up some sandwiches and coffee but I thanked him but I only wanted to sleep.

The baby is now in the hospital, they were able to stop his convulsions after about 2 hrs but he is still being treated. My daughter was able to get back to the hotel for a change and she was assured that there would be a room available to her for as long as she needs it, they said she can come and go whenever she needs to to shower and sleep and she should not hesitate to ring room service for food at any stage. I cannot say enough how grateful we are.

If I could award them aprize for excellence I would. Never will my family stay anywhere else. The Croke Park hotel is for me number 1 in the world. Thank you, thank you.

211,Excellent!,"Great location, next door to Croke Park Hotel. Car park fee was included in room price. Room was very clean, modern, excellent facilities. 
Friendly staff.
Great value for money.
Food delicious.
Fitness suite excellent

211,Excellent Service,"Really good quality hotel with really friendly service. From check in to check out everyone we met at this hotel was genuinely friendly and helpful. The easy free carparking, excellent rooms, lovely Bar food available and the great location just a 15 minute stroll from O'Connell St, and yet away from the hustle and bustle of town makes it ideal. 
      ",5,2014,11,09
211,never had a problem before - but unable to shower this stay,"The Croke Park Hotel is usually an excelelnt choice, but on this stay I felt that at €200 room only no breakfast was over inflated and the fact that the shower did not work added to the mix - which made this stay dissatisfying.  We were in a room with 2 double beds, and had not had this type of room before and my son complained that the bed kept moving and they did, no castors to hold them iin place.  It was only an issue when you were getting in & out the bed would move out easily from the wall.  I would receommend the Croke Park Hotel as a place to stay - but on this occasion they fell well short of my expectation as a regular customer",3,2014,11,08
211,Worth it!!!,"Really enjoyed my stay here. Stayed for 3 nights while sight seeing in Dublin. Rooms were spacious, clean and comfortable. Staff really friendly and helpful. We dined in the bar one night and could not fault it. Definitely worth the money! Would stay again!",5,2014,11,05
211,Excellent break,"We had a very enjoyable, relaxing break.  The executive lounge was great.  Our meal in the Bistro was lovely.  Breakfast was outstanding!  Staff were so friendly and helpful.  We will return in the future!",5,2014,11,05
211,Great hotel,"stayed for three nights 29th Oct-1st Nov 2014, great hotel and facilities. A little out of town but no big deal really. Only reason i've not given 5 stars is that the room we initially booked (room with 2 doubles and a single) was not available???? and this after booking around 2 months in advance direct with hotel and checking in early on arrival day. A satisfactory outcome was reached where they gave us 2 separate rooms next to each so we were buy the kids(teenagers). Would stay again though!!",4,2014,11,05
211,Great Stay,"Croke Park is simply a great hotel.  Staff was ridiculously friendly and the amenities are fantastic.  Excellent location right across the street from the stadium and the surrounding area is very nice.  Easy walk to local attractions.  Bed was super comfortable and they allowed us to check in early after a turbulent flight overnight from the states.  When I return to Dublin, I plan on staying here.",5,2014,11,04
211,an excellent stay,"hi just back from spending 3 nights in this hotel. its about 15 minutes stroll from the centre of town and about 5 minutes and 8 euros by taxi.

we got a deal via trivago and for 192 pounds it was a steal , a spacious room on the executive floor , it had a wee sitting room with coffee and teas , breakfast was included in the rate but i thought it was for the 'free continetal' that was on offer in the lounge and expected to have to pay for a cooked breakfast in the sideline restaruant, nope that was also include and at 15 euros each if we had had to pay shows whata  great deal we had got. the hotel staff where all very friendly , the room was great the bed was great , bathroom with seperate bath and shower was ideal. would i return to this hotel , you better believe it . the hotel also sold the green hop on off bus tickets at a slightly reduced rate , 17 euros instead of 19 but the real bargain is that throughout the day they run a shuttle bus that comes to the front door of the hotel and takes you down to oconnell street where the  tour buses start from , the shuttle was almost every half hour from about 10 up till dinner time and was a fanatstic feature. 
next time im in dublin if i get a deal anyway near as good as I just had there no doubt where I will be staying . 

thanks to all the staff of the croke park hotel , a credit to irish tourisim !!!!",5,2014,11,04
211,Cosy Experience,"The Room Was Clean and Cosy. The Staff Were Very Friendly and Helpful. The Staff Were Very Interested and Good Natured With My Small Children. Great Location, Breakfast, Staff, Atmosphere and a Fabulous Spacious Room. An Overall Great Relaxing Stay.",5,2014,11,04
211,Excellent,"My boyfriend and I stayed at this hotel for 4 nights for a half term break.
The staff were very friendly and always available to help no matter what the query. They were able to recommend restaurants, attractions and public transport route to save on taxi fare.
The room was clean and well decorated; quiet but not deserted.
We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at this hotel and would definitely recommend it to everyone.",5,2014,11,03
211,"Out of the action, but worth it!","We stayed at this hotel for two nights over the weekend of 31st October. We booked a package on Secret Escapes which meant we got the hotel half price, as well as free tickets to the Guiness Storehouse, some free drink vouchers, a free taxi ride to the city centre, use of the executive lounge and a 20% off voucher for the restaurant. The fantastic deal we got may have biased me towards the hotel a bit, but there is no doubt that this hotel is fantastic

Unfortunately, the hotel is a way out of the city centre. In the day the twenty minute walk is pleasant enough, however once it got too dark I would not have been too happy walking. A taxi cost us between 10E and 15E depending on where we were going. However what the hotel lacks in location it makes up for in every other department. The rooms were clean, spacious and pleasant, with one of the best and most modern bathrooms I have seen in a hotel to-date.

The service of all the staff was excellent, but particularly those working in the bar and restaurant who were friendly and attentive. We ate in the restaurant both at breakfast (which was varied, fresh and very tasty!), and in the evening (again very good and not bad value for money compared to other restaurants in Dublin). They even provided a turn down service where they brought up a hot water bottle and chocolates - not something I've ever received for that kind of price before!

We were delighted with this hotel, and did not find the location off putting at all. If you were visitng Croke Park this hotel could not be more perfect! However the area was not well serviced by public transport so not great if you're working with a budget.",5,2014,11,03
211,Family weekend in Dublin,"What a fantastic hotel!

Lovely clean hotel, the most friendly staff you could ever wish for and a great price for a city break.

even at check-in we were given hot towels to freshen up, which felt great! The reception, bar, restaurant and concierge staff all made us feel really welcome and everyone made a fuss of my 18 month old son. He loves his little teddy bear too :)

The bar/restaurant is great for breakfast, lunch, evening meal or just a lovely pint of the black stuff!

 We couldn't fault any part of our hotel stay and it truly is a family friendly hotel.

Thank you for making our short break relaxing and enjoyable.",5,2014,11,02
211,Excellent,"From the time we arrived at this hotel, the check-in-staff giving us wipes for our hands was a lovely touch,to the time we left it was a fantastic stay. All staff were excellent ,so much so that it would not be fair to single out anyone in particular. The breakfast was great with plenty of choice.
We had two evening meals on our deal and they were both excellent ,for my wife and I. Piping hot and plenty of it. The room was cleaned to as high a standard as we have seen in any hotel that we have been to. Our deal was on the fourth floor,the executive floor, which was an added bonus.It had a relaxation room with tea and coffee making facilities ,orange juice, bottled water,newspapers ,tv etc. Right across from Croke Park Stadium for GAA fans. Only a fifteen minute walk to the city and a lovely walk but only in daylight hours.We will be back to this hotel for sure.",5,2014,11,02
211,Fine hotel but nothing special,"My husband and I stayed here for two nights.  The hotel is clean and staff are friendly and polite.  It has a ""business travel feel"" to it and just nothing very endearing about it.  The location is excellent for an event at Croke Park stadium (across the street) but for visiting the city, I would have preferred something closer to the city center.",3,2014,11,01
211,Family Trip To Dublin,"We booked a family deal with a trip to the zoo for the mid -term . An excellent package and very good value for money . We were greeted by excellent and friendly front desk staff and first impressions last . All the hotel staff were friendly and helpful . The room was bright , modern and spotless with free fast Wi-Fi . We had  a great trip to the zoo , a handy 10mins by car , followed by a lovely evening meal for the four of us at the hotel . Great menu and again the staff could not of been more friendly and helpful . The girls went shopping the next day , a 15 - 20 min walk to O'Connell street and had a great day . The complimentary parking is also a huge plus in Dublin . I would highly recommend it for a family or couple looking for a city break . Thanks and hopefully we will stay with you again .",4,2014,10,31
211,Nice Discovery,"Needed overnight accommodation for early morning ferry out of Dublin Port and all the usual hotels on city south side were booked out. Tried this hotel and was so pleased to have found it. Very quiet and comfortable, staff couldn't have been more friendly or helpful. Even provided takeaway breakfast as we couldn't make regular breakfast sitting. Rooms and general fabric all finished and maintained to good standard. Secure underground car parking, close proximity to port and city centre. Will definitely be staying here again.",5,2014,10,31
211,Good hotel good value!,"Got an excellent deal with this hotel. Not too far from Dublin airport probably 15 mins and costs about 18 Euros. The hotel itself is right next to the Croke Park stadium. Hotel was very clean, rooms are spacious, and the bathroom looked spotless! Not even a water mark on the silver taps.
It is about 15 mins walk to O'Connell street. The area isnt the best though although i think that the case with most of the areas out of the centre. We didnt have any issues walking to and from the main attractions.
Good choice for breakfast, fast room service. We gave our cases to conceriege on the final day to look after our bags until we went to the airport. Staff are excellent!",4,2014,10,31
211,Fantastic staff !!,"Stayed here for the bank holiday weekend as my friend was running in the marathon , the first night we waited awhile for our food but it was extremely busy so we understood and the food when it came was exceptional ..the level of service on the second night we ate in the bar was a lot faster and Ronan ( Nenagh ) who served us remembered us from the first night made sure we were looked after , Iv been to this hotel before for gaa games and have noticed the level of service is exceptional all round ..a bit of music wouldn't of gone a miss on either night but we thoroughly enjoyed our stay ... Thank you ",5,2014,10,30
211,Anniversary,"We got a great deal from lastminute.com via their secret hotels site. After emailing the hotel to inform them it was our wedding anniversary and was it possible to pay for an upgrade. The following day we got a reply by email informing us of a complimentary upgrade.
The hotel is situated directly opposite the Croke Stadium and it looks recently renovated.
The staff were very friendly and nothing was too much for them. 
The executive suite was an added bonus and well worth upgrading to. There was water, coffee and orange juice...but the shortbread biscuits were to die for (well done chef). Continental breakfast was available from 6am and also included fresh salmon.
On the evening of our anniversary there was a card and two bottles of prosecco waiting (we certainly didn't expect this and it was a great surprise). To anyone considering staying here don't delay, stay today!",5,2014,10,30
211,Great stay!,"We stayed at the Croke Park for 4 nights. The staff are the greatest asset of this hotel - friendly, helpful and they genuinely want you to enjoy your stay! The food in the hotel was fantastic - we had one of the best steaks we have ever tasted. It is out of the city centre but only about a 15 minute walk. We stayed in a room on the 4th floor and it had access to an executive lounge where you could get juice, tea, coffee, water & fruit 24 hours a day - it was a lovely, quiet area to relax in. If in Dublin again we would certainly stay here!",5,2014,10,29
211,Another lovely stay,Four years since our first stay at this hotel and it is still an excellent hotel.  The room and bathroom are very spacious.  The beds are so big and comfy with lovely fresh bed linen.  The staff are so friendly and courteous.  The food is excellent and the lounge is lovely and inviting.  All in all a lovely stay.,4,2014,10,29
211,Review on Croke Park Hotel,"The hotel has been recently refurbished and is a great place to stay . IT is very well priced and is a good 4 star hotel . IT is located slightly out of town , but a short 15 minute ride to the city centre . Good value for money , Has a really nice bar . If there are events happening at Croke Park it is the best option to consider",4,2014,10,29
211,Business Trip,I had the pleasure to spend 7 nights in The Croke Park Hotel and enjoy an unbelievable high level of cleaning and high standard services. I had a feeling coming to my room for the first time every evening. Food is very decent and the staff is super helpful and provides appropriate service for the cathegory! Absolute exceeded my expectations!,5,2014,10,29
211,First Visit to Dublin,"I really liked this hotel. The staff were friendly and helpful, the room was very nice and the facilities were top notch. The only thing that prevents me giving this hotel an Excellent 5/5 rating is the location and the shocking (literally) iron. 

Check-in was from 2pm but we arrived at 8:30am. I called ahead to let them know we would be early and we were told that we would be able to store our bags so that we could go off exploring. When we arrived at the hotel however, they had a room ready for us. This was a very welcome surprise and one that we were very grateful for. 

Our room had a single and a double bed. The double bed was very comfortable but the single bed didn’t get used. The room had a decent sized TV, an iron and ironing board, plenty of wardrobe space and complimentary tea/coffee which of course was accompanied by a kettle. There’s also a mini fridge containing drinks and a key coded safe. I think the safe was free to use but we didn’t need it. The bathroom was very spacious and had a separate shower and bath. We didn’t use the bath put the shower was excellent.

Disappointingly, not all was great. I noticed that the iron was damaged, unfortunately this was only after I had put some water in it and plugged it in. There was a flash and a pop then all the lights went out. I contacted reception and they had the power back on in under 5 minutes but no one showed concern or asked what happened. I can only assume that the power goes off all the time!! When I checked the iron I could see that the rubber seal around the wire was damaged and the iron had a slight leak. Electrical items should be checked when the previous occupant checks out, this clearly hadn’t happened on this occasion. 

My only other issue with the hotel was the location. This was partly my fault but it looked closer to the city centre when I looked on Google Maps. We walked from the hotel to the city centre and it took around 30 minutes. A taxi back cost 12 Euros. We paid £75 for our room but there are hotels at a similar price closer to the city centre. Our room also didn't come with breakfast so I can't comment on the food quality but felt the breakfast was slightly expensive at 15 Euros. On our travels around the city I saw plenty of signs outside pubs and restaurants advertising a full cooked breakfast for between 8 - 10 Euros.

Overall I did enjoy my stay and the hotel is very nice. The iron incident could’ve happened to anyone really but next time I’ll look for something closer to the city centre.",4,2014,10,29
211,We love this hotel!!!,"My husband is a pilot and stayed at this hotel for years with continental airlines and for a while with united. I have been here 5 times and just love it, too. Upscale, really clean, great bar/lounge area that fills up often. Great court yard….the rooms are really sweet and the food is delicious with cool presentation. All the employees from front desk to the kitchen are the sweetest people.
Very efficient employees that have a nick-nack for details. Thank you to all of the staff for making me smile every time I visit you…………..",5,2014,10,28
211,a very enjoyable stay.,"We stayed at The Croke Park hotel for 3 nights....excellent. we booked an executive room...a wise choice and well worth the extra few pounds. Our room was on the edge of the upper block with only the linen cupboard for company.....so no noisy neighbours! The hotel has a lot of rooms and was full occupancy when we were there, but it never felt crowded. The Sideline bar is a great place to finish the evening.....and the food is impressive too! As we had a continental breakfast included as part of the package, I cant comment on the cooked breakfast, but the free continental one was more than ample for us.....another great advantage of the executive option is the use of the lounge, including tea and biscuits available throughout the day. The room was spotless, the only negatives being lack of wardrobe space.....ok if you are only staying a coupke of nights, but struggle with storage if staying any longer. Also, the water pressure was very weak, although this did not affect the shower too much.
Overall, an excellent hotel and well worth a visit.....will definately stay again the next time we visit Dublin. Well done everyone at The Croke Park hotel.",5,2014,10,28
211,Fab breakfast!,"We requested a room with a view which we did not get.  However, bed was vey comfortable but was on wheels which moved freely.    Room itself was lovely and bathroom was excellent.   Breakfast was of a very high standard and waiting staff were very courteous.    Bar was lovely but on a Saturday night there was elevator music playing and absolutly no atmosphere.  Do not come back for a night cap if you want atmosphere.",3,2014,10,28
211,Very comfortable hotel and atentative staff,"really loved our 3 nights at Croke Park Hotel because the rooms are decorated to a high standard and all the staff we dealt with were very happy to help to the best of their ability. 
The hotel is quite a walk to city centre but there is a free shuttle bus apparently but didn't feel the need to use it. 
Recommend. Very good value for a high quality hotel. ",5,2014,10,27
211,Croke park weekend break,"Just spent weekend at this lovely hotel in Dublin. Want to compliment staff on friendliness and attention yo details. All staff from front desk to dining room staff esp Dan and cleaners were all so polite and courteous . Hotel is fairly close to city centre and quiet on non GAA match days although many rooms were occupied it still felt very comfortable with staff very available. Rooms on fourth floor with access to executive lounge were luxurious with robes and slippers included. Overall would recommend the hotel highly and will definitely obe back !! 
",5,2014,10,27
211,Great all round value,"We stayed in a de-luxe room on the 4th floor on a deal with secret escapes. Our room was excellent. It was immaculate in relation to cleanliness and it was large with comfortable seating. The bathroom was very spacious with excellent toiletries.
Breakfast was 4 star quality and the staff were very warm and helpful.

It is 15 minutes walk to Connolly and we used the canal walk during the day but not later as there were people hanging about.
The only downside of the area is that there is only one restaurant near the hotel, an Italian which was great value with a 2 course special at 17.95 with a drink included.

The hotel bar was normal for prices and lots of good seating. There is a executive lounge on the 4th floor which was superb with free tea and coffee and orange juice and fruit.j

I highly recommend this hotel it is one of the best 4 star hotels we have ever stayed in.",5,2014,10,27
211,Great All Rounder,"Stayed here with some girlfriends for the weekend.  Hotel was absolutely great - very clean, smelt lovely, staff couldn't do enough for you. Food and facilities fantastic.  If I had to say one thing then it is not in the town centre but its very quick to travel in.  I was aware it wasn't in the centre and chose it as it was excellent value for money for us all and not as expensive as a town centre hotel.  Would definitely stay again.",5,2014,10,27
211,Beyond my expectations...,From the hot towel at checkin to the very comfortable and clean room to the informative concierge to watching football on the large screen TV in teh lounge...I had an excellent stay. I slept soundly every night! When I return to Ireland I will check availability here first.,5,2014,10,27
211,Genuinely excellent,"The Staff - without exception every single member of staff we encountered was so nice and went the extra mile time after time for my family (including anticipating needs i may have). i have an older boy as well as babies and older boy was made feel very special - hot chocolate at breakfast for him etc. 
The room was two double beds and cot and yet though not a huge room it was a good size for all of us. the bathroom was a very good size and we could park our buggy in there so that it was no taking up space in the bedroom. the room was air conditioned and had plenty pillows , blankets, towels etc. 
What was absolutely fantastic was access to the executive lounge.  being an executive lounge i was not sure children would be allowed but it was no problem , the lounge is big enough for a family / group to take a corner and relax there chatting, play ipad , read newspaper etc.  with access to tea /coffee and fruit if you wish. there is a tv and music there too.  this room though not a play room was perfect for relaxing away from the room.  One of my toddlers woke very early (clocks went back) and i just picked her up and brought her to the lounge room which meant the rest could sleep on without being disturbed. there was breakfast available in this room which was a real treat for us.  We also met  airline staff who arrived in from an over night flight to stay in the hotel and one of them gave my little one a 'wings' badge and one from her older brother , they were thrilled. 
We had our dinner in the restaurant on one night ,  the food was excellent quality and adults and children were catered for extremely well.  the house wine was really good and served at a lovely temperature.  
The hotel had a lovely energy about the place , the other guests were so friendly - the atmosphere set by the staff from the moment of check in rubs off on the guests - sounds strange but actually I believe this. 
The location of the hotel is brilliant - can park the car free of charge , the hop on hop off bus collects at the hotel, we didnt use it, however as far as i could see, one bus operates a shuttle to join up with the main hop on hop off tour bus and another passes the hotel more regularly, - I recommend checking with the staff for further information. 
What more can i say -
Were presented with warm damp towels to freshen up on checking in
check in was fast and very pleasant
staff were professional and very nice.  - A young man checked us out, I asked him how long he worked with the hotel, he said was a recent hire (he is a student in DIT, his name escapes me), he is a very good hire to add to the workforce.  
Hotel and room were spotless
free wifi
across the road from croke park & museum",5,2014,10,27
211,Nice hotel - perfect fora good night's sleep,"This is lovely hotel. Beautiful rooms, nice staff in the main, nice food and some attractive bar areas. We chose it because it was offered at a good price but also because it wasn't right in the centre of town- but rather about 15/ 20 minutes walk away. We wanted to enjoy Dublin but also get a good night's sleep. I would definitely recommend it. Discovered it was right next to Croke Park Stadium - nothing much happened there whilst we stayed however - could be a good/ bad thing on a match day.

Room service on night one was good - but couldn't get into my diet coke because of the lack of a bottle opener - and providing one seemed to stump everyone. Very very minor complaint however,Lift one did not like our keycard either.

Really comfy beds. lovely bathroom. clean rooms and a bit luxurios too",4,2014,10,27
211,3rd visit and counting..,Another excellent stay at The Croke Park. This was my wife and myselfs third trip to Dublin and also our third stay here.I have written reviews about The Croke Park before but I feel it deserves every accolade.We got lucky with our first stay because we keep coming back! See you next year..Keep up the superb work.,5,2014,10,26
211,"Modern, spacious and professional level of service","I chose this hotel mainly because I rented a car to drive around Ireland, so I placed the parking as a must and I didn't really mind about the location.

I say this because the only downsize I could find in this fine establishment was the location, right on the side of the main Stadium of the city and kind of outside the center area where Dublin main attractions are located. But having said that, Dublin is a small city, so we could walk from the hotel to the city center, taking your time and enjoying it, so it's not really a problem unless you are looking for a place really near the hot places.

So, the rooms are really big for the price, fitted with modern but not over the top furniture and decorations. Same goes for the building. Breakfast was full of options, including lots of sweet and baked and fried options. Service was very very professional, including welcoming at the hotel, helping you with the printing in the business center, arranging a taxi if needed and providing timely and delicious room service!

So after considering my commentary about location, I would definately recommend the place for a next visit!!",5,2014,10,26
211,Great hotel,"This is an excellent hotel. Good location. Across street,from Croke stadium. Staff superb. Rooms fantastic. Easy connection to Grafton at. And all the highlights in Dublin. We highly recommend this hotel.",5,2014,10,26

211,Great Staff,"Young, retired couple stayed at the hotel for three weeks. We can not say enough about the staff.  They were friendly, knowledgeable and great people.  Nothing was 'too much trouble'.  The food was amazing as was the service.  The rooms were clean and generous.  We would recommend this hotel to anyone who is traveling to Dublin. The concierge service was 'above and beyond' what we expected.  We can not wait to return. One thing to keep in mind is that the closest bus stop was a ten minute walk, however you can walk into Dublin City Center in twenty minutes. Great vacation.    ",5,2014,10,25
211,My favourite place to stay in Dublin,"Perfect location, close to city centre. Excellent food and very attentive staff. Have stayed here many times and I've never been disappointed.(Except when there is no room for me!!). Keep up the good work!

211,Very nice stay!,Check in and check out were both a breeze! Hotel was lovely. Rooms were roomy and nice and the bathroom was so clean I could've eaten off the floor. Breakfast was simple but nice. The bar area was quaint and affordable for a hotel. My only complaint would be that the elevator's are not always easy to operate but most hotels are going this way so we may as well get used to it. Pretty hard to put your room key in and push a button while carrying a couple of coffee's to your room. And it doesn't always take the first time so a bit frustrating. But other then that it was a terrific stay! Not super close to the action but not a bad walk either. Taxi back from Temple Bar at the end of the night was only 10 euros and taxi to airport was only 18.,4,2014,10,24
211,Perfection!,"We came to Dublin for the first time for 2 nights, we stayed at the Croke Park Hotel not knowing anything about the city. 
From the minute we walked in the staff were there to help with anything we needed. The hotel is beautiful and has a great 'hop on hop off' bus service with friendly guides to help you get the best experience. 
We came over for our anniversary and the hotel put champagne and chocolates in our room to make sure the stay was extra special. 
There is not one thing I could fault with this hotel. The staff are lovely and everything else is just amazing. Had a lovely stay here. Well recommended.",5,2014,10,23
211,catch the hop on hop off bus,"We spent two nights at the hotel the first of June 2014. The room was clean and nice but the hall ways seem to be going through some renovations. The hotel is across the street from the soccer  stadium but we lucked out and no games were going the days we stayed. You can catch the hop on hop off bus right in front of the hotel so that was continent. Our meal in the hotel restaurant was nice but pricey. Breakfast was a nice buffet and include in our room cost. I was not impressed with Dublin city other that the Trinity Collage tour, and the jail tour, they were both very nice. The bus drivers, taxi drivers, along with the citizens of Ireland our very nice and helpful.",3,2014,10,22
211,A really pleasurable experience.,"I travelled to Dublin for my birthday, and had a two night stay with my wife and daughter.  I hadn't realised when booking (through third party booking site) that I had booked an executive room.  What a good move that was.  We were allocated a room on the 4th floor, which gave unlimited access to the lounge on that floor where tea, coffee, refreshments and biscuits were all free, all day.  Also provided was a voucher for each of us to have a free drink in the 'Sideline Bar', which we naturally did.  The bedroom was well equipped with tea and coffee making facilities, TV, Wifi, ironing board and iron, trouser press and a safe for our valuables.  The bathroom was lovely with a bath and a separate shower cubicle.  A nice security touch was in the lifts, where you had to have a room swipe card to enable the lift to move up from the reception, so any Tom, Dick or Harry couldn't just wander up.  As is suggested by the hotel name, it was located right next door to the Croke Park Stadium and was only a 10 minute walk into the city centre (O'Connell Street) and a further 10 minutes from the busy nightlife of Temple Bar.  Hotel staff were without exception a polite and friendly bunch, full of smiles and helpfulness.  I only have two slight issues.  One is the bed, which was little soft for my liking (I have a bad back, so not the fault of the hotel) and the second is the TV in the room, which has a rather awkward menu system, making it a bit of a chore to change channels.  In the big scheme if things, these are minor niggles and I would thoroughly recommend this hotel.  In fact, I already have.",5,2014,10,21
211,Fantastic Stay,"Booked through Secret escapes and couldn't have been more pleased with the hotel. I was expecting to be in a small room out of the way of the full paying guests but couldn't have been more wrong. The room was excellent. Bathroom was huge with good lighting for makeup etc. only issue was that we couldn't figure out how to open the minibar but probably just us being daft. An addition bonus in the form of an executive lounge on the floor with refreshments throughout the day and continental breakfast in the morning which came in handy when we missed breakfast one morning. 
Hotel located about 25 min walk from the centre of Dublin with shuttle buses in the mornings and afternoons.
The reception staff were lovely and I would specifically like the thank the concierge (Krishna?) for helping us sort out tickets for the sight seeing bus and everything else we wanted.
Only downside was the waiting time for dinner on the final night which meant we didn't have time to eat before leaving for the airport. However the guy serving us arranged sandwiches for us to take away which was great. 
All in all a lovely stay and will be back again soon!",4,2014,10,21
211,Nice city hotel,"Stayed here for 1 evening would have to say one of the best city hotel we have stayed in for the price!
room was wonderful we where on the first floor had everything you would need in a room and more.
we had our evening meal in the sidelinebar have to say very tasty and good value for money
staff on every level where very attentive. 
to get a taxi was no problem plenty outside hotel.10 Euro to Dawson street on a busy wet Friday evening v.good value i would say considering parking charges in that area.would stay again when we return to Dublin.",4,2014,10,21
211,Luxury,"The hotel is beautiful. Very well-maintained. The staff are generally polite and helpful, and the service is very good. A lovely, comfortable bedroom. Temperature a little hard to regulate. Breakfast was lovely.

211,Fun Hotel Close to all the Sporting,This is a very nice hotel and close to all the major sporting arena in Dublin. I love the style of the rooms and a newer hotel then most in the area. Great rooms and size and loved the bar scene at the hotel. LOVED this place.,5,2014,10,20
211,Couldn't have asked for better!,"We booked and executive stay at the hotel and expected good but it was excellent! What a brilliant, faultless hotel! The service was exceptional! The general overall look of the hotel was of an excellent standard. The room was very well presented and cleaned twice a day! We wanted luxury for our two day stay and that's exactly what we got! I could write endless good comments on this hotel! I would highly recommend this to anyone! :)",5,2014,10,20
211,A four star hotel with condition of three stars,"I think that the Croke Park Hotel is quite nice place to stay. After all I assume that a hotel that has 4 stars would have more comfortable rooms with some glamour.. The staff was friendly and the breakfast was very good as well as the restaurant. I find it a bit hard to believe that this hotel is located only 1,3 km from the city center. Well, it depends where is the city in one`s opinion. To O´Connells street was the shortest way but I doupt that it is not that near. ",3,2014,10,20
211,SHAmazing,My partner and I stayed at the Croke Park Hotel between the 16th - 18th October 2014. This was a little surprise weekend away for my birthday and I am happy to say we had a fantastic time! When we arrived the member of staff behind the counter was extremely helpful and friendly. We could not have asked for more from our executive room on the 4th floor (continental breakfast included). The bed was massive and extremely comfortable; we heard no noise and enjoyed our bottle of bubbly and red wine upon arrival. I also liked my personalised birthday card from the hotel. The town center was only a short 10-15 minute walk from the hotel. I would HIGHLY suggest this hotel to anyone looking for a lovely getaway to this delightful capital.,5,2014,10,20
211,Fantastic Hotel,"Great deal with S****T E******s  stayed here for 4 days fantastic.
Room was deluxe which entitles you to access to 4th floor executive room(free coffee and juice and continental breakie.
Room great,got lost in gigantic bed !
Food in restaurant was good (but not great menu)
Breakfast in morning was best ever.
Staff were first class very friendly.Even brought me a hot water bottle.
Walk into Dublin takes 15 minutes.from hotel,but be warned do not do it at night,far too many dodgy people hanging about the street corners and its bad enough during the day.
We went out at night looking for some bits ,the tesco is at the top of the road turn right then 300 yds its on the left.But as i said groups of foreign nationals made the journey bit nervy (so be on your guard)
Other than that taxi to O'Connell street 9 euro.Taxi to airport 25 euro.Get the open bus tour 19 euro hop on and off (green bus) brilliant !! and stop at Guinness tour it was really eye opening.
All in all enjoyed our trip.(not that expensive)
Flights from Glasgow on ryanair £63 return.no problems.
So go for it and and enjoy the craic.",5,2014,10,20
211,Great hotel,"We stayed for a couple of nights - the room was great as was the bathroom. We had the Deluxe room which was really worth it.
The breakfast was excellent - far better than the one we paid for on our first day at a restaurant in the city centre.
The service was top class.
Don't be put off by the walk into Dublin - it isn't far and it's very pleasant. There are regular taxis for about €7 if you don't fancy it.
Definitely recommend!",5,2014,10,20
211,Great comfy hotel with everything you need,"We stayed here the first night of our Ireland trip. It was really nice for the one night. We ate pizza at a spot around the corner, enjoyed the location close to the stadium, but also enjoyed the relative quiet of being a bit away from the city center. Beds were cozy, room was clean, and staff was friendly. Wifi is throughout, but there are also two computers with internet for access in the lobby which was helpful for checking things when heading in or out. Hotels in Dublin area can be quite expensive, the decent price of this hotel as well as its good ratings are what drew us to it.",5,2014,10,19
211,"Very nice hotel, convenient to airport and city center",I stayed at the Croke Park Hotel for the last two nights of a CIE tour. I was very pleased with the accommodations. The room was large and the beds were comfortable. There is free wi fi throughout the hotel. The hotel is across the street from Croke Park stadium. It is a 20 minute walk from the city center. Very nice restaurant and bar area. The bar menu is available in both the restaurant and the bar itself. I highly recommend the fried prawns on the bar menu. Very fine breakfast buffet with the best Irish cheese of my entire trip. The staff was very helpful in arranging a taxi to the airport. Check in and check out procedures were very efficient.,4,2014,10,18
211,Hard to beat,"After being unable to secure a booking in a hotel of choice in Galway late last Thursday, I decided to travel to Dublin a day early and returned to the Croke Park Hotel. It was worth the 2 hour late evening drive and as always everything about this hotel was top class - excellent service from all staff, most comfortable beds of any hotel I have stayed in and super breakfast. I travel quite a bit for  work and In comparison to other hotels I stay in, the Croke park wins hands down every time. Thanks again to Sean and his staff for another great stay.",5,2014,10,18
211,Interesting location! ,Located across from the stadium and about 5 blocks from the center of Dublin. Would never of thought to put a hotel where it is located. Staff was very friendly and helpful.  Rooms were clean and the food was great! Would definitely stay again.,5,2014,10,18
211,Great Hotel!,The room and service were exceptional!  We were on an inclusive tour of Ireland and didn't know where we would be staying.  We were delighted with the accommodations. Service and parking were great.  Security was above board.  Would definitely stay again if we were in the Dublin. ,5,2014,10,18
211,Not for us,"The location is advertised as close to the center of town and very convenient. That is not true, there isn't even a pub anywhere near!  It is located just across the street from the Croke soccer stadium so check the stadiums schedule for athletic or entertainment events if your staying here or you can encounter chaos.

Hotel is below average in everyway from location, to rooms, to cleanliness and amenities.",3,2014,10,17
211,"Nice Hotel, but very mixed-feelings about service","We had an opportunity to stay in Croke Park Hotel for two nights.
The hotel itself is very nice, unfortunately the service we got and attitude of employees wasn't always on the appropriate level.

First disappointment was the fact that it was our anniversary trip. We made note about that when we were booking our room and it was not mantioned at all during our stay.

Room was nice and tidy. Housekeeping did a great job while attending our room too.
The only problem was TV which remote controller did not work. It of course would not be a problem, things like that happen. Unfortunately we had to called reception to get a new one 3 times. First time we called concierge, which took our request for new remote controller but did not show up for about 30 minutes so we simply left the room. Then we called again in the evening. But we had to call third time when no one was coming for about 20 minutes again...
I understand that there might be situation when hotel staff is busy, that would not be an issue at all if we at least heard some small apology or got a smile. Unfortunately, Christopher who was the concierge that day wasn't really too friendly. He was one of people who did not make us feel very welcome there. (On the other hand the other concierge we met the other day [bald guy] was very nice and helpful).

Another big disappointment was the service in the bar. The bar itself was ok. Nice place and the food was great. But the service...

For the first time when we went there no one attended our table at all. I had to make an order, ask for the bill etc. going myself to the bar or to one of waiters.

Second time when we wanted to eat there again we decided that we are going to wait for the staff to attend our table. Unfortunately, we were waiting over 20 minutes... and even though staff saw us and passed our table few times we were just ignored like they were too busy with something else to take care of us. Luckily, there is a small, nice Italian restaurant just a minute away from hotel so we decided to eat there and we did not regret that decision at all. No point leaving money in place where someone act like they simply don’t want it… and that is the impression that the hotel’s waiters made on us that night.

What was a huge positive was breakfast. Very nice place, great food. And this time the service was very good and friendly too. The pancakes we got were just incredible, made big positive impression on us and made our day :)

Location of the hotel is not bad, about 20 minutes walk from city centre.
To sum up, I guess I generally could rather recommend that place for stay. But in such competitive times we have now, with plenty of hotels which do their best to go extra mile to gurantee possible best service I guess for this reason there are some better choices then Croke Park. Places where you will feel welcome and taken care of by all staff members, not only selected ones.",4,2014,10,17
211,"""A memorable short break in Dublin especially at Croke Park""","My son and I stayed at Croke Park for 3 nights on the first floor facing Croke Park Stadium. To our surprise the hotel management welcomed us with complimentary champers in our room to celebrate birthdays. Staff extremely helpful with reasonable size room & bathroom both extremely clean. Morning breakfast very good and more than plenty for everyone. Croke Park stadium (opposite) and general surrounding didn't make any difference at all although it would be advisable to avoid stay during matches/events days or week-ends. Distance from city centre not an issue because all most all buses outside Quinn's pub nearby pass through the city centre. Didn't try evening meals at the hotel but tried a lovely Irish Beef & Guiness pie at Fagans pub at Lower Drumcondra nearby. Evening in Temple Bar area was very enjoyable listening to Irish music/ dance and a couple of cocktails to go with as well. According to my son, the best hotel we have ever stayed in the countries so far visited and we have visited quite a few and I concur with this view.",5,2014,10,17
211,Great break in Dublin.,"Just returned from 5 nights in the Croke Park. Lovely hotel, and situated in a relatively short distance from city centre. We were in one if the 4th floor executive rooms, lovely big bathroom and plenty of complimentary toiletries. We had the added advantage of access to the executive lounge with tea, coffee, juice and water all day. The food in both the restaurant and bar was very good, but in some instances was a bit expensive for what it was. The staff were friendly and helpful and the massive screen in the bar area was definitely a hit with the males of the party. I would recommend the Croke Park to anyone visiting Dublin.",4,2014,10,16
211,Excellent stay in croke park hotel dublin,"For a few days conference I stayed at this excellent hotel just outside the center of Dublin
The staff is very friendly, rooms are great, Wifi is every were and excellent. And it was within walking distance of almost everything. Even transfer to the airport was fine.",4,2014,10,16
211,One night in Dublin,"Very nice hotel convenient to O'Connell Street.  Hop on bus stops directly in front.  Easy 10 minute walk as  well.  Friendly and helpful staff and concierge.  Restaurant was not very crowded and service was a bit slow, but a nice glass of Proseco made the wait go by..  Good value.  Free parking. Rooms very comfortable.  Nice place to stay in Dublin. Only difficulty was the morning drive from the airport.  Dublin rush our traffic is insane! ",5,2014,10,16
211,Croke Park Rocks,"Amazing service. We flew in at 5am and were totally exhausted. We were able to park our car early and check in to 2 rooms that were available. I doubt this could happen during high season though. It really made our stay in Dublin work without having to sleep in the car in order to recover from the flight. The breakfast was outstanding. The dinner server seemed like he didn't know what was going on and it took a long time to get drinks and to order when the restaurant wasn't all that busy. It was nothing that would make me not consider Croke Park as my first stop in Dublin. 
      ",5,2014,10,15
211,"Nice, Quiet Hotel","We arrived in Dublin from the states in the early afternoon, only one room was available but staff was helpful and allowed us to check in. The bed was the most comfortable hotel bed I have slept in, the view from the windrow was not the best. Got room service after a very long day of sightseeing, great tasting food for room service. Only problem was it was a handicap room and the shower in the bathroom ran over the whole floor, had to put towels down to contain the water.  Great breakfast in the AM, kept us going until later in the evening.",4,2014,10,14
211,Last night on our CIE tour,"An impressive hotel to end our 8 day CIE tour  -- as it was the last night of the tour,  we did not spend a whole lot of time here (dinner included with the tour for this evening was at a different location).   A very clean and comfortable hotel - almost luxurious (noticed that there were several airline pilots staying here) - large room, very comfortable beds, large bathroom, nice amennities.  We did have breakfast here before departing for the airport and it was more than ample  and it was the first time my daughter saw peanut butter offered - peanut butter does not seem to be a favorite food in Ireland as it is in the US - she was suffering from withdrawal!",4,2014,10,13
211,"Great, Clean Hotel","The hotel is very clean and well maintained. The staff is very friendly and helpful! The hotel is a short walk to the bus stop so you can get to St Stephens Green in about 20 min total. The Sideline Bistro is great! The food is wonderful - tried the club sandwich and the Irish Stew and both were great! Our sever, Stacey, was FANTASTIC! She gave us recommendations of things to do and see in the area and even took the time to write down names and directions. If you happen to get Stacey as a server, you will be back at the Sideline Bistro every night! The hotel also offers a continental breakfast for less than 10 euros a person. I am from the United States, and when I hear ""continental breakfast"" I normally think bagels and orange juice. This is NOT your standard continental breakfast! They offered sausage, eggs, bacon, meats, cheeses, hashbrowns, made to order coffee (including lattés and such too), juices etc. The hotel also had an ice/water machine on our floor, which was great since we were able to fill up our water bottles. Overall, I had a very pleasant stay and would definitely return if I am ever in Dublin again!",5,2014,10,13
211,Average Hotel,"I really had an enjoyable stay here. However I encountered one issue a small leak in the shower area from the floor above.  The night manager was called and informed but no follow up to see it everything was ok.  The lack of communication in that respect was poor.  
The concierge were wonderful very helpful. I preferred talking with them then the actual hotel reception staff.  More approachable. 

The food was ok. The bistro menu is ok for a quick bite to eat but to enjoy the chefs cuisine order and sit down in the main restuarant area. Breakfast is the meal event that shouldn't be missed. So fresh tasting and a relaxed atmosphere. 

Overall. The location of where the hotel is great about 10 minutes from city centre. Great access to taxis and link to the tour bus.",3,2014,10,12
211,extra comfy stay,"The Croke park hotel, was a very pleasant stay, for several reasons. If you want somewhere just outside of the hubbub of the busy and beautiful city of Dublin this location is great only 20mins to half an hour walk into the heart of Dublin or plenty of bus routes to take you into the city. Having done work in the city during the day some nights I didn't feel like going back into the city to eat. The food at the hotel was truly first class without a first class price tag. This i would say without a doubt is the hotels greatest attribute. You can rest assured to stay in you will not be missing out on a very good meal. The staff are most accommodating and down to earth and friendly. Very clean rooms, my stay as you can tell was a very pleasant one. Not the most picturesque area it is right next to the Croke stadium, and nothing was on at the time I was there, so maybe take that into consideration.
Also just up the road was a fantastic Italian restaurant 1 minute walk. Thanks .",4,2014,10,11
211,Very impressed!!!,"Booked a last minute city break with Stena line ferries for myself and husband. Really good price and just thought hotel would be average. My husband and I were really impressed. We had what was described as standard double. This was a good size, very clean. Bathroom had bath and walk in shower with nice selection of toiletries. Beds very comfortable. We arrived a bit early and reception staff very helpful and suggested we go to sideline bar and they would let us know when room was ready. We had lunch which again was excellent and true to their word came to find us as room was ready early. Hotel is 10/15 min walk from city centre depending how how fast you walk. Hotel had free parking under hotel with lift up into main reception. Check out is 10 am but they allowed us to leave car all day and just validated our ticket before we left.  Bought tickets for the green hop on/ hop off tourist bus from the concierge for 17e and it picks up outside hotel and takes you up to Main Street. Excellent value for money and would highly recommend. You also get discount off some main attractions. The hotel is opposite Croke park stadium but it was closed the whole time so had no issues with noise etc I would have no hesitation to recommend this hotel to friends or family.  Full Irish breakfast each morning which was excellent with lots of choice. We also had a bottle of water each when we checked out - everyone likes a freebie.",5,2014,10,11
211,"Spacious, well-appointed and great value","Booked this because of its positive reviews and a very reasonable online rate, and I was not disappointed. I think worthy of its 4 stars, the hotel is roomy and well-presented, the staff were great (thanks for the transport advice Christopher!) and the room spacious, well-appointed and spotlessly clean. A bonus was that O'Connell Street was closer than I had thought and only an easy 8-10 minute walk way. Another bonus for me (personal preference) was that I was able to open the window in my room for some natural ventilation (to clarify, the aircon/heating in the room was fine/worked perfectly well).",5,2014,10,11
211,Very comfortable hotel,Really enjoyed our stay at the Croke Park Hotel.  Lovely atmosphere and very comfortable room (bed was so comfy).  Staff very friendly and helpful.  Even though it is not in the centre of Dublin there was no problem travelling in and back - only 10 minutes in taxi or bus.  ,5,2014,10,10

211,Tour Hotel,"We stayed with a CIE tour. This Hotel was very nice, excellent service. We ate dinner on our own there one night without the tour group, it was excellent, service was also excellent. The food was a good value too. Had laundry done, back quickly. Not one complaint. I took a taxi from Downtown back to the Hotel for 8€. I could have walked if I had wanted to. Breakfast buffet had good food and good choices.",5,2014,10,09
211,Croke Park!,stayed here Friday 3rd October for 3 nights. we came to Dublin to see Ed Sheeran @ 3arena on the Saturday and decided to make a weekend of it.  It was a very rainy afternoon when we arrived we were soaked after walking from the bus stop!! the staff at this hotel are so helpful - couldnt do enough for us - they gave us hot towels to wipe the rain off us as we were checking in!! We stayed in a Superior room - a mistake i made on booking - superior sounded better than deluxe (it isnt).  But the room (339) was lovely everything we needed with a huge bathroom with a separate shower and bath.  The bed was massive and really comfy our view wasnt the best - railtrack and the river but it was quiet the couple of trains we did hear were not distracting.  The hotel isnt in the most central area but we bought a 3 day travelcard at the airport for 30 euros each allowing us to travel around the city - there are a few bus stops close by although we walked into town one day and took around 15 mins and was a nice walk through Mount Joy. If you need any directions or advice on where to go - ask the concierge he was so helpful and advised the best way to get to the Guiness Storehouse is the Hop on Hop off bus (a great tour there and back) I loved Dublin and The Croke Park hotel - we will be back!!,5,2014,10,09
211,"Wonderful hotel, exceptional staff","Had the absolute pleasure of staying at Croke Park Hotel for the weekend of 3rd to 5th October with 3 friends for the inaugural 'Tough Mudder' event in nearby Punchestown.
The staff were magnificent from the moment we arrived, and were always friendly and willing to answer any questions we had. The rooms were excellent, with powerful shower and bath, and the beds were extremely comfortable. The bar was spacious, with excellent food served until 9:30pm, and the prices were very reasonable (they say Guiness tastes different in Dublin, and it definitely tastes better!). There is safe parking below the hotel, which was free for guests. The concierge provided excellent suggestions on meals in case you don't want to stay in the hotel.
It is not often I would stay in the same in hotel if visiting a place for a second time, but we are already planning a trip next year, and will stay here again. 
As a nice final touch, they gave each of us a bottle of water on check out to take to the airport, which is only 15 minutes away in a car. 
Excellent location, excellent facilities, excellent staff, simply excellent!",5,2014,10,08
211,Enjoyable comfortable gem,"I have been staying at the Croke Park Hotel since not long after it opened and look forward to each stay. The rooms are comfortable and spotless, the bathroom is luxurious, and there are no words for the comfortable beds!  Every member of the staff had always been top-notch and the restaurant is amazing. The only downside is that the hotel is across from Croke Park (literally across the road) and on match/concert days it can be daunting. The surrounding neighbourhood can be a little dodgey at times, but overall I've never felt unsafe at all. While it's certainly not in the city centre, it's a short walk into town (10 minutes or so into O'Connell Street) - and the surrounding businesses over in Drumcondra offer a lot of variety.  All-in-all a truly comfortable place in Dublin!",5,2014,10,07
211,Very comfortable stay,Stayed two nights recently when in Dublin on business. The hotel was busy which was good as it created a buzz in the bar in the evening. The bar food was good as was the breakfast and the staff were helpful and efficient. I had a very comfortable room and a perfect nights sleep. I will be returning.,4,2014,10,07
211,a very lovely stay,"Getting in late that night into Dublin we wanted a comfortable place to stay. 

The staff were efficient, friendly, and helpful. Providing us with bottles of water for 

The bedroom were clean, well designed and spaced.  The bed was a bit on the soft side for my liking but comfortable nonetheless.

The buffet breakfast was very good as you would expect from a hotel of this high standard.  

The WiFi was quick and reliable. 

I wouldn't recommend the late night sandwiches (they were okay)... but certainly I recommend the Guinness!",4,2014,10,07
211,Disappointed,"I stayed at the Croke Park over the past weekend , having previously stayed there on several occasions .
Taking account of the fact that I had booked a number of weeks ago , at over 200 euro per night , and that the hotel was obviously not nearly fully occupied , I was disappointed to be offered  a first floor room totally dominated by the back of the Hogan Stand . This totally blocked all sunlight . Reading newspapers in the room  at 9:30 am either morning required the use of room lighting in spite of good sunshine outside . 
The problem was exacerbated by the decision to have outside contractors commence powerhosing the outside of the hotel , right below our window from 10:00 am on Sunday morning !!
As the powerhosing was obviously pre arranged , I feel it was wrong to allocate these rooms , particularly as the hotel was not particularly busy .Mentioning the matter at check out did not elicit any explanation.",3,2014,10,06
211,The concierges were amazing!,"This was a wonderful hotel, clean, modern.  We really enjoyed our stay here.  The concierges were wonderful and very helpful.  They helped us numerous times from giving directions to different attractions, setting up Gravedigger tour, and having a taxi waiting on us for our trip to the airport.  

It was a 20 minute walk to city center and was a very safe walk.",5,2014,10,04
211,Faultless,"Really comfortable room. Efficient and friendly staff.  Good food.
Good location especially for Croke Park. I had a very comfortable nights sleep and couldn't fault the hotel or the service. Would highly recommend.",5,2014,10,04
211,Nice hotel,Friendly staff and clean hotel. We stayed in 4 different hotels while in Ireland and this was my favorite. We had breakfast while here and it was also top notch. I'd stay here again. My only complaint was that my wife and I got a room with 2 beds making the beds smaller.  That said everything else was great. ,4,2014,10,03
211,car2987,"It's way over priced. It's very clean and the rooms are average but nice. The hotel staff were friendly and very helpful. The downside was the restaurant. As I sat in the main dining room waiting for my meal, I turned toward the kitchen to watch and pass the time. I watched my waitress take the basket of rolls off of a dirty finished table, place them on the side with dirty dishes, then she came out of the kitchen, picked up those same rolls and gave them to me. She didn't realize that I had been watching the whole thing. When I called over the manager, he apologized. She came over and tried to explain.... No one thought it was anything wrong....",3,2014,10,02
211,Match Time,"Going to the Hurling Final, this was the perfect hotel, directly across from croke park stadium, the staff were great, there were huge crowds, and they were very efficient. Rooms very basic but clean and tidy:)",4,2014,10,02
211,Our first stop on our honeymoon!,The staff was very nice and helpful. We were not familiar with the area and were driving ourselves around Ireland in a rented car. The consierge provided us with map and directions. He was great.The room was beautiful and comfortable.,5,2014,10,01
211,Great Hotel in Dublin,"Just out of the City Centre but within easy reach just opposite Croke Park Stadium.

Modern - Good facilities including underground parking and friendly staff…Excellent choice of food and drinks….Only small complaint was that we had to wait 30 minutes for a main course in the Dining room but the worth was worth it.",5,2014,09,30
211,Weekend in Dublin,"I have stayed here on Business and was never in doubt as to the level of service and friendliness of staff at the Croke park. I brought my Mum back to Dublin for the first time in 20 years and even she commented on how well the staff looked out for her. It was the weekend of the Hurling Final replay and Katherine arranged for us to sit in the executive lounge away from the packed bars. Aoife  on reception , Jennifer and Ian (Waiting Staff) are awesome and they all made our weekend so much more fun. Well done , great service and great care!!!!
      ",5,2014,09,30
211,"Comfortable, relaxed hotel with all amenities","Overall a very friendly comfortable hotel with ideal car parking facilities for anyone visiting Croke Park.  Executive lounge was most welcoming and relaxing, staff very helpful and polite. Just a pity our team didn't win the football!!  ",5,2014,09,30
211,Friendly and helpful staff,"The staff working at this hotel were all very friendly and helpful. Room was comfortable, however, smelled very strongly of smoke. As non-smokers we were really bothered by the smell. Had we not arrived so late at night and been exhausted we would have asked to switch rooms. Bathroom was large, clean and well stocked with toiletries. Hotel was an easy 20 minute walk into the center of town. The water bottles provided before we set out for the day were much appreciated.",4,2014,09,29
211,Excellent all-round,"The staff are friendly, smiling abd go out of their way to make you feel welcome. Everybody greets you with a smile.
The rooms are clean and well kitted. Clean and efficient.
Food at the restuarant is gourmet class. I enjoyed it very much.
All in all a great hotel",5,2014,09,29
211,Warm and welcoming,"The hotel is lovely, has a wonderful breakfast, comfortable beds and friendly staff.

We enjoyed dinner one evening that was interesting and very good.

I would definitely recommend this hotel.

We needed a computer to print boarding passes, their business center was easy and pleasant.",4,2014,09,28
211,Day 14,"Plush hotel. Reception staff very efficient and helpful. Room clean and comfortable. We had dinner which was very good and served quickly even though the restaurant was very busy due to a big event taking place in the stadium. Good touch was the bottles of water handed out at reception, for our journey, as we checked out.
Day 1, Hampton Hotel, Dublin",5,2014,09,28
211,Excellent,"A 15minute walk to centre of Dublin but that is no problem. 
Big spacious rooms with a luxurious bathroom. 
Free wifi 
Very obliging staff, very friendly
If you are interested in bar hopping in Temple Bar, then choose elsewhere. This hotel was fabulous at the end of a busy day to sit and have a ""quiet"" drink.",5,2014,09,28
211,Nice stay,"We visited in September 2014 and had a nice stay. The room was clean and comfortable. Bed was comfy as well. The lobby was classy and when we went to the bar for a drink, it was crowded and the food looked good. Service was good, especially when I accidentally blew a fuse trying to blow dry my hair. The staff fixed this within a few minutes... And I then found the room's blow dryer. The location is a little outside the central city, but we walked everywhere other than the train station when we had our luggage.",4,2014,09,27
211,Very good hotel,"this hotel was a pleasure to stay at and nearly everything was up to good standards. the toilets and bathrooms were clean, the location was ok, the furniture was good, the wifi connection worked. nearly everything was really good apart from we booked a double and a single, and we got a sort of fold out bed which I thought was a bit slack since we did not book it one or two nights before, it was weeks before.",4,2014,09,27
211,A good honest hotel,"This place has all you might need in a hotel. Nice rooms, bar and staff and an half decent restaurant. Location for us was good as we were working at the 02 but it is definitely not slap bang in the middle of the city. Cabs are easy and not too expensive though and Irish taxi drivers are always interesting!",4,2014,09,26
211,This hotel is a class act!,"We recently stayed at the Croke Park. This is a very modern, efficient hotel. The staff are extremely attentive. We were erroneously given a smoking room (we find it hard to believe that a hotel of this calibre would even have smoking rooms) but were promptly given a non-smoking one along with profuse apologies when we asked to be moved. The room itself it clean, modern and spacious, with AC that made it very comfortable to sleep. The bathroom has a large tub and separate stand-up shower, with lots of counter space on the vanity. Breakfast was delicious and the service very professional. On checking out, we were offered complimentary bottled water for our journey - a lovely gesture.",4,2014,09,24
211,Croke Park Hotel,We had the pleasure of staying in Croke Park Hotel over a very busy weekend(All-Ireland Football Final). Our service was excellent.Nothing has a was a problem. We also had a table for 14 booked for the restaurant. All of our meals were of a high quality along with the service even though the restaurant was full.Excellent hotel with great staff especially Sean and Catherine,5,2014,09,24
211,Tim O' Byrne,"I have stayed in the Croke Park Hotel on several occasions, my latest stay was on the 19th September, as usual I found the staff very friendly and helpful. The hotel is situated in a great location, has great food and accommodation and is very family oriented. So whether you are on business or on a visit I highly recommend the hotel",5,2014,09,24
211,Nice hotel,"The hotel is located next to the Croke Park Rugby Stadium.
About 15-20min walking from O connel street and Connoly station.
Our room was huge, large bathroom. The breakfast was nice.
Very friendly staff.
From the airport to the hotel the cheapest is to take bus 16 (2.60eur) and get off at Drumcondra Station.From Drumcondra station it is a 5min walk.",4,2014,09,23
211,Great hotel,"The hotel is situated in a very quiet location, yet only 15 minutes walk to the bustle of O'Connell street. We arrived before 8 am as we were on an overnight flight, and to our great shock our room was ready! We were thrilled, as all we had been expecting was to store our luggage and go out for a wander for some breakfast and shopping. We were put in one of the largest hotel rooms I've ever stayed in Europe. I would even go so far to say it was huge. Two double beds with gorgeous sheets and pillows, heaps of floor space to have our luggage open (three large suitcases) and still be able to walk around the room. The bathroom was very nice and came with all the little amenities needed. We did not partake in breakfast as we were out of the hotel by 630 am every morning for our day excursions, however I would imagine it would be very nice. We had one lunch meal in the restaurant and it was really good, fresh food. The staff were very courteous and helpful with all our many questions. I wouldn't hesitate to recommend this hotel or stay here again, especially if there was an event on at the stadium it would be very convenient. I've noticed some other reviewers commenting on the taxi prices to and from the hotel, which I too noted were kind of dear, but I can't fault the hotel for the cost of taxis in Dublin. I knew where I was staying when I booked it and was expecting to pay a little extra for transportation. It was worth it to be out of the craziness!!!",4,2014,09,22
211,"Great hotel, disappointing end.","Stayed for 4 nights in the Croke Park Hotel. The hotel itself is lovely, clean and staff are helpful and polite. The only actual downside to the hotel is that it's seems to be in abit of a rough area, and taxi's to and from O'Connell st. Could have been anything up to 10 euro. 

Overall, generally impressed with the hotel, we had a comfortable stay etc, however, in the day of our checkout, and on the way to the train station, we realised that a bag of gifts had been left in the hotel room. We got the taxi to turn around to collect the bag, and a member of staff went and checked the room, and brought the bag to my boyfriend. Once in the taxi we realised we were actually missing one of the gifts!!! Decided not to assume anything and check our bags thoroughly once we arrived home, but alas, no gift. Extremely disappointed that someone had actually rifled through my personal belongings, regardless of the fact we had checked out, and had taken it upon themselves to chose something from the gifts, disregarding the fact I could have came back to pick the bag up later on in the day. Unfortunately not a case of misplacing the item as we had both checked the bag before leaving to check everything was there. 

Would have given 4 stars to this hotel but hard to overlook the fact someone had pinched something from my bag. ",3,2014,09,21
211,very nice,"The hotel was very quiet and clean. We arrived at 5AM, and the hotel clerk was very kind and gave us a room much earlier then check-in. I was very grateful, as I was tired and stressed from driving in the dark on the left side of the road.
Be sure to check if something is going on in the stadium across the street. It could make driving very congested and difficult.",4,2014,09,21
211,Booked room not available but otherwise very good,"We travelled from the UK arriving late at night and were distressed to find that, despite paying in full 2 weeks in advance for our stay and paying a supplement for a superior room, reception tried to give us a small standard room saying the hotel was full. This we refused to accept and insisted on speaking to the manager. He was more helpful, giving us a room on the executive floor for the first night, with the room we'd booked for the subsequent nights - and he also provided free breakfast for the entire stay, which was a generous offer and which we appreciated.

The breakfasts were lovely, the rooms were comfortable and clean and everything worked. We asked for brighter lights in the second room and this was immediately sorted out. We were glad we'd checked out before booking that there were no football matches at Croke Park - this hotel is directly across the street from the stadium ie about 30 foot from the stadium!

We were able to walk into Dublin city centre in 20 to 25 minutes and there were frequent buses available too.

We ate in the hotel bar a couple of evenings and the food was good, though not particularly exciting. The bar is a pleasant place to be.

This hotel is a very good option if you need a comfortable base without the expense of being in the centre of the city - recommended :)",4,2014,09,21
211,Great place to stay,"From the moment of our arrival, we were treated with a friendly smile and hot face towels at the reception. Our rooms on the executive floor were great and comfortable. The executive lounge offered coffee, tea, water, etc all day and a complimentary continental breakfast. Our room also came with a free evening drink from the bar downstairs. There is a free shuttle bus to the downtown core which is handy because the walk is a bit far.
A nice place all in all.",5,2014,09,21
211,Croke Park Hotel,"We stayed at this hotel 2 nights and were impressed.  The hotel was situated across from Croke Park Stadium.  Easy access to Dublin.  Staff went out of their way to make our stay memorable.  Room was great!  We will be back,!",5,2014,09,18
211,Great hotel!,"Perfect for our one night in Dublin. Hop on hop off bus will pick you up right at the hotel and you can buy tickets right at the hotel. Clean, comfortable rooms. Really can't think of any complaints! Free parking and wifi.
      ",5,2014,09,18
211,Excellent Hotel,"From check in right through to check out I found warm helpful staff, a very clean modern well laid out room but with nice extra touches such as the best towels I have seen in hotels in a long time and the complimentary bottle of water on checkout, also the complimentary wi-fi which was great, unfortunately other hotels seem to think charging for wi-fi is a way of maximising customer spend. This is one of the nicest city hotels I have stayed in in recent years.",5,2014,09,18
211,A brilliant place to stay in Dublin,"We chose the Croke Park Hotel as it was one of the hotels offered by the ferry company who we sailed across with. I can honestly say that spending that little bit extra compared to some of the more central hotels was absolutely worth it. A big bonus is the complimentary parking which is hard to come by in Dublin. Saving that money offsets the fact that the hotel is very poorly served by regular public transport - so much so that taxis are outside at the end of the road all day long. It's around €7-8 for a taxi down to O'Connell Street.

The area around Croke Park is not the best and I wouldn't necessarily fancy walking the streets there at night so bear that in mind for late returns. If you're doing the open top tour bus then that both picks up at the hotel about 4 times every morning and runs back to the hotel till about 3.30pm in the afternoon which can be helpful and a cheap way to get to the centre and back.

The room was very nice and looked out over the river/canal at the back of the hotel. We were above the bar courtyard area but it wasn't overly noisy. Beds were comfortable and the bathroom was very clean and very big. There was a separate tiled shower cubicle and a separate bath so it catered for whatever your preference.

There's a good choice of TV channels and when we had a problem with the sound on our TV it was sorted out immediately by a very helpful member of reception staff. An ice machine is at the end of each floor and there's an ice bucket and tongs in the room as well. 

We had breakfast each morning at the hotel and although on 2 of our 4 mornings the service was a bit haphazard - an issue which the hotel have apologised for since I filled in their customer satistfaction survey so I can't say fairer than that - the food itself was excellent and the choice plentiful. One of the nights we also ate in the bar area and the food was hot and fresh and fairly good value for money by hotel prices. 

The bar is again typical hotel prices and so not cheap but by far not the dearest place we sipped a pint in the city. My only reservation is that the bar was full of families in the evening - some of whom were happy to consider the entire bar a free for all creche for their kids - so don't expect a quiet or romantic experience. The big screen TV/projector is good if you can sit at an angle where you can see what is on it but the whole bar area is decorated nicely and very comfortable. 

The staff, especially on reception and the concierge, were very helpful and exceptionally polite.

Should we return to Dublin I wouldn't hesitate to book here again. It's a smashing, reasonably priced upper end city hotel that is worth every penny.",4,2014,09,17
211,Croke Park Hotel Review,"Nice and very cosy hotel with excellent facilities and very friendly staff. Good value for money but little far away from city center. Gets very crowdy and noisy when there is match in the Croke Park. 
      ",4,2014,09,17
211,Trip Advisor Reviewers Were Not Wrong!,"Maria, Gerardollie, Herbert P, was right on their reviews. If I ever come back this will be the place.

This place great location close to both Dublin Airport and Dublin City Centre also the soccer stadium the Croke Park Hotel is the ideal accommodation choice for both leisure guests that wish to explore the exciting city of Dublin, Ireland.",4,2014,09,17
211,Delicious lunch,"A group of us ate here after a family mass in a local church and weren't disappointed.  I opted for the soup which was gorgeous sweet potato and butternut squash if I'm not mistaken.  Its genuinely the nicest soup ive ever had in a restaurant.  I also opted for a side of chips that were again lovely. My parter had the soup also and a ham sandwich which was lovely.  Others in the group had a selection of sandwiches including chicken and stuffing, cesar salad which were all lovely.  A number of others also had scones. To finish we had the vanilla cheesecake which was divine.  I cant wait to return. Our server was really friendly and helpful as were the bar staff.",4,2014,09,16
211,Great place to stay in Dublin,"Excellent service, friendly staff, good quality rooms within reasonable walking distance of the city. Green ""hop-on, hop-off"" bus service almost at the door makes all tourist venues readily accessible. Concierge Stephen very helpful.",5,2014,09,16

211,Lovely Hotel,Stayed here for one night and thought is was very good. The only issue I would have is the price of the bar food and the menu available. Food was lovely but thought the options weren't great and a bit overpriced compared to other hotels we stayed within dublin. That aside the bar itself is very relaxing. Staff are very hlpful and Rooms are spacious and perfect.,4,2014,09,15
211,Excellent choice for visiting Dublin,"We choose this Hotel because of the perfect position between airport and city and we are very happy with our choice. It is an excellent Hotel with own car park, 15 minutes walk to city and 20 minutes with the car to the airport.
The room we had was very modern, comfortable and  also quiet.

211,Amazing Hotel,"This hotel should be a 5 star, its amazing.On arrival we were offered towels to refresh ourselves and the girl at front desk was so friendly yet very professional. We were treated to a room on the 4th floor which allows you access to an executive lounge, The rooms are spotless and the bed so so comfortable. We were also treated to complimentary champagne because it was our anniversary. The restaurant serves delicious food. I will never stay anywhere else while visiting Dublin.Just an amazing hotel.",5,2014,09,15

211,very welcoming hotel,"We have stayed a few times at this hotel, and as always I cannot fault it. Staff at reception on arrival are very friendly and also in the restaurant. Rooms are always clean and the beds large and comfortable. Will definetly be using this hotel again. ",5,2014,09,14
211,check there isn't a game at the stadium,"We always stay at the Croke Park Hotel when we are passing through Dublin and it is excellent but on our recent visit there was a big game at the stadium. We arrived in Dublin by car at lunch time but couldn't get into the hotel until 4 o' clock as the roads up to it were closed, we had to drive around as there were no parking places. When we did finally get into the hotel it was crowded with people watching the game on tv and there were extra bars set up for after the game, the reception staff were still very good.
We chose not to have dinner or breakfast in the hotel as it was so crowded and we asked for more coffee etc for the room but none ever arrived.
We should have checked that there wasn't a game, but we definitely did not enjoy our stay as much as our previous visits.",4,2014,09,13
211,Fantastic hotel,"I booked this hotel at the last minute last Wednesday evening as we had to be in temple street hospital at 7 am on Thursday morning, The lady I spoke to on the phone was so helpful and after being told we were only 8 minutes walk to temple st and gave us a discounted rate as we were going to the hospital.  
When we arrived that evening the 2 ladies on the desk were extremely welcoming and gave us a teddy bear for our little boy. The rooms was beautiful and spacious and spotless I cant recommend this hotel enough I Will be back albeit under different circumstances. ",5,2014,09,12

211,Memorable Birthday Weekend,"I was surprised with a 3 night booking at this hotel for my 18th birthday for me and a partner.

We stayed in a Queen Room with access to the executive lounge. The room Its self was spotless, with a surprise of many complimentary items including robes, slippers and toiletries. The person who had booked my stay had requested to the staff to makes our arrival 'extra special'. As soon as we approached reception the staff couldn't have been more polite and at welcoming. As well as wishing me a happy birthday, they handed me an envelope containing 3 free drink vouchers which we used at the Sideline Bar and Bistro. We got to the room and instantly spotted a 'happy birthday banner' and balloons on the wall, as well as a card wishing us an enjoyable stay. About an hour after settling in, a staff member knocked on our door holding a free bottle of champagne and two glasses, much to our surprise and delight. 

The first night we decided to order a room service meal and dessert, which was impeccable. We also had dinner the last night in the Sideline Bistro, which was equally stunning in terms of service, presentation, and quality of food. 

As we had access to the executive lounge, breakfast was included each morning which consisted of a continental buffet. The variety of breakfast selection was fantastic. The miniature pastries we're a particular favourite each morning and staff made a conscious effort to refill and replace breakfast items immediately. Also, in the evening, shortbread biscuits were available for guests to take which I felt was a nice touch. 

Overall, I felt the staff couldn't have done more for us throughout our stay, exceeding standards of any customer service I have ever experienced staying in other hotels. I would highly recommended to anyone. No complaints whatsoever.",5,2014,09,08
211,Terrible,"Was in this Hotel on Sunday 7th of September. The All Ireland Hurling final was on so there was crowds of people around. I went to the stadium early but stopped in to this hotel for a mineral before the game. My daughter was with me and the porters had the people moving in and out in an orderly fashion, fair play to them all and we're extremely friendly to everyone. Anyhow when I got to the bar it was packed with people so I stood behind the front line at the bar and waited my turn. Everyone in front if me was served and I knew it wouldn't be long until it was my turn. Just at the corner of the bar there was a divider to the service area so I stood on the bar side of this as the waiting staff were seating the customers who we're going into eat. Then Nadia Shields a member of management I would think as she had a suit on came  to the corner I asked her for my drink and she said very abruptly that it wasn't my turn and picked up a sign from the service side of the divider and slammed it down in front of me and shouted at me "" and this is the service area anyway"" I was shocked at her behavior. If. Which I wasn't in the wrong place WHY  DID SHE SERVE EVERYONE IN FRONT OF ME.  My daughter was shocked with what she did. We turned and left. I would never go into this hotel again or recommend it. I do understand the bar staff were under pressure on the day but my God her attitude was uncalled for. ",1,2014,09,08
211,Excellent stay in quality hotel,"Excellent rooms (only gripe is proprietary TV is from mid 90s and not in line with everything else). Great location (though try and avoid walking through Ballybough).  Justifiably a 4 star hotel and probably the best in North Inner City Dublin.  I would definitely stay again.
      ",5,2014,09,07
211,"Comfortable, good service","This is a not too well known hotel given the area it's in -- off the city, and not the best quarter in Dublin, so to speak.  However, for business travellers who'll take a taxi anywhere, be it the East Point Business Park or anywhere else, it's a reather great venue.  Rooms are huge an perfectly apppointed. It's B&B, and guests will get two bottles of water plus a big bowl of fruit every day in their rooms (at least I did).  Service mindedness is superb, and both the breakfast and the bar and bistro (including an open air terrace) are really well appointed and serviced. Conference center and gym are great too. For business travelers who need to go to East point Park, there is a free shuttle srevice every morning.  And this is one of the few hotels in dublin which still has smoking rooms.",4,2014,09,06
211,Great place for a short break,"Clean, neat, comfortable, well appointed. Air conditioning in the room. My only complaint is the shower. Piddly flow of water. The hotel needs to invest in pumps for the showers. It's the staff that make this hotel... Every single staff member we spoke to was absolutely fantastic and very helpful. ",4,2014,09,06
211,Fantastic Hotel.,"I have nothing bad to say about this hotel or the staff. They always went above and beyond. Good food, great facilities. Even though it is off the beaten path it was easy to catch a cab or bus from the hotel. The price was very reasonable. Great atmosphere for any event at the stadium next door. Nice rooms, quiet floors were the guest rooms were. Short walk to a take away, convenience store, and a few pubs. Just loved it.",5,2014,09,04
211,Lovely hotel,"Staff was kind and helpful during our stay at the Croke Park Hotel and they were able to answer all of our questions. The Sideline Bistro was great, as was the service. Free parking was a great bonus. Genuinely lovely hotel stay.
      ",5,2014,09,04
211,Croke Park,"Exceptional hotel. A bit pricey and the area is a bit dicey it seemed, but the rooms were great and the staff very helpful and accommodating. The breakfast and Dinners there were great. Since we had been staying in b and Bs it was great to get a workout in  at their gym. And with games being held at the croke park venue it was an exciting location.",5,2014,09,03
211,4 Star Hotel At Such Great Value,"Never stayed in the hotel before last Saturday but rest assure I will be making a return reservation in October and December.  The whole experience from checking in, the beautiful room and fantastic beds, the lovely bathroom and great decor not to mention the in room breakfast service which arrived on time and was lovely and hot.  Nothing seems to be any problem here anything you asked for or required was dealt with immediately.  I would certainly recommend this hotel  for all of the above reasons and of course for the great value - not a lot to pay for a 4 star hotel in a city centre location.",5,2014,09,03
211,Business Trip,"In Dublin for barely 24 hours and stayed at The Croke Park Hotel for the second time. I had forgotten what an amazing hotel this is. The staff are excellent, rooms, amazing, selection of meals is great and perfect venue. We were exhibiting at Croke Park which is just across the road. It is also only a 20 minute walk into the city centre.",5,2014,09,03
211,Really Nice place in Dublin,"Went for the recent Penn State v Central Florida game and really loved this hotel. Compared to most European Hotels the rooms were very spacious, also clean, quiet, and really nice. The staff was really helpful and courteous. Dublin isn't a super big town so this place is still a doable walk and easy cab ride to anywhere in Dublin. The Hotel Bar and Restaurant was also very good.  That said, Croke Park itself is worth seeing, it is a real landmark and they do nice tours.",5,2014,09,03
211,Most convenient for Croke Park activities,"This truly is right across a little street from Croke Park.  On the ground floor, there are plenty of cozy bars in which to watch television with others or enjoy live music.  
The hotel room was adequate, but lacked any drawers (other than a desk drawer) and bathroom counter space.  The water pressure on the 4th floor was hardly enough to flush the toilet or take a shower, but it did work.  
If you want hair conditioner, be sure to ask for it...it's not with the usual supply of items.",3,2014,09,02
211,Highly recommended!,"We stayed at the Croke Park for a couple of nights last week and thoroughly enjoyed our stay. On the day we were due to arrive there was an all Irish final at Croke Park which I didn't take into consideration when making our booking but the hotel kindly warned us about this via email before our arrival and we took the necessary steps not to arrive whilst the final was being played. 

The rooms are the Croke Park are extremely comfortable, very clean and spacious. There is a separate bath and shower in the bathrooms which is something I appreciated. Breakfast was excellent and we also had a nice meal at the Sideline Bar.

The staff is very friendly and we also appreciated the free parking and the fact that they give you a bottle of water on check out for your trip.

We will definitely pick this hotel again on our next trip to Dublin.",5,2014,09,02
211,Great stay as usual,"Great stay as always. The staff are fantastic on all levels and the food is a really good standard from breakfast to dinner
Upgrade your room on checkin to an executive room to get use out of the exec lounge as well as early checkin.
The hotel is about a 10 minute walk to the heart of the city",4,2014,09,02
211,One of the best.....,"We are on our way home from a 2 night stay in Croke Park Hotel. It was superb, the room was lovely, plenty of tv channels to choose from, lovely bathroom, comfy beds etc etc. Breakfast was amazing! Had dinner in sideline bar also which was fabulous too. Very family friendly, great children's menu! 
What made the place really special though was the staff, everyone we met was lovely! At reception, concierge, waiting staff, cleaning staff, everybody was genuinely lovely.... The waiters in the bar on the evening of the 28th were super, great fun, plenty of banter, talked to the children, made them feel at ease completely. 
One more thing to mention, it is not a bad walk to city centre, around 25 mins but taxis are super. We took 3 varying in price from €7 to €11, so a great option if the feet are tired! 
Overall it was a brilliant hotel, much cheaper than other city centre hotels I priced and definitely one of the best I've ever stayed in. Hopefully we will be back!",5,2014,08,31
211,excellent choice for a family,"we stayed 3 nights in a standard family room (2 double beds). We were very friendly received and supported in any request from travelling explanation to parking system. The breakfast was excellent, the buffet  comprehensive and generous. The only cons is the position which is not central but Dublin anyway is not a metropolis and downtown can be easily reached.",5,2014,08,29
211,4 star quality at a 2 star price,"We really enjoyed our stay at the Croke Park.  The room was very nice, the staff, wonderful and the buffet breakfast of very good quality with a nice aray of choices.
The neighborhood, however, is a little weird and out of the way.  We had difficulty getting back one day as the bus driver told us they did not stop at the bus stop after 6 due to ""social deviance"".  We did not have any problems even walking back in the evening but some of the surrounding blocks were a bit tattered and the bus driver's comments made us nervous.
The hotel offered as  shuttle which we had not thought of using (dids not note time/ pick up point)  until after we had difficulty getting back.  I would recommend taking advantage of this service.
It is only a few minutes by bus to the center of town.  This location is bettrer for those interested in sporting events (as the stadium is right across the street) than for those interested in general tourism.
My only issue with the hotel is the location.   The quality of the hotel itself, staff and dining was all very nice and an exceptional value.",5,2014,08,29
211,Top Class Hotel,"My wife and I stayed here the day of an All-Ireland Semi Final at Croke Park. Absolutely fantastic hotel. Great rooms, very clean, friendly staff....I could go on and on. It really is an exceptional hotel! I would highly recommend it if you are staying in Dublin.",5,2014,08,29
211,Great hotel,"Excellent location close to Croke Park. City centre easily accessed from hotel, I walked into O'Connell Sreet in 25 minutes. Rooms and beds exceptionally comfortable. Hotel was busy but no noise in rooms. 
      
      ",4,2014,08,28
211,decent stay,"While we were here, there was a huge tournament across the street at the Stadium and we were't inconvenienced by it at all considering the bar, restaurants and streets were packed with people.  No noise at all.
Hotel is very modern, nice comfortable beds, large and bright rooms.  They have free wfi which  was very fast for the crowds.
We had dinner outside on the patio the first night and the waitress brought us wraps because it was getting chilly...nice touch...food was fast, hot and tasty.  Very nice breakfast bar in the morning.   
There's a bit of a walk to get to the shopping area and other restaurants and pubs..",5,2014,08,28
211,One night family stay,"I stayed in The Croke Park Hotel for one night with my husband and 2 children aged 12 and 9. I also booked a room for my step daughter and her 2 children aged 2 and 4. The rooms were excellent, the staff were very helpful. The concierge service was super and very helpful recommending child friendly restaurants.  The bar area was especially nice and relaxing. Overall a great experience and we will be back.",4,2014,08,28
211,Overnight family stay,"Stayed here for one night as family with 2 children in preparation for catching a ferry. The room was very spacious and clean, with 3 lovely beds, tea and coffee making, TV etc, very good shower and bath, nice toiletries, staff very helpful and polite, breakfast had a huge buffet choice of hot and cold items all very nice, could not fault the hotel in any way and would definitely stay again. Also it has secure underground parking, perfect if your car is full of luggage etc. The bar was very nice with lovely seating in front of a huge TV and a lovely effect fire, drinks not cheap but served with plenty of complimentary nuts and box of Lego was available to amuse the kids so can't complain about that! Overall excellent value",5,2014,08,28
211,Great Experience,"Reception was extremely pleasant and helpful.  Concierge service was exceptional.  Hop On Hop Off bus tours are available from the hotel.  Taking the bus tour allows you access to downtown with its great restaurants and shopping.  Restaurant and Bar at the Hotel offer great food and drinks.

I am a 1K traveler and this hotel is a 5 Star at a 3 Star price.  Great value for the money.

I look forward to my next stay.",5,2014,08,27
211,Nice hotel adjacent to Croke Park,"Front desk pleasant but not overly welcoming.  Busy day with GAA match.  Room very comfy.  Nice beds apart from 1 that dipped in the middle.  Good TV with plenty of channels.  Clean bathroom with nice shower and amenities.  Directly across the road from Croke Park so perfect for matches.  Very crowded but pleasant crowd.  Could not get parking due to match which was disappointing.  Breakfast very good.
      ",4,2014,08,27
211,"Great hotel, Great value","A group of 4 of us spent one night here -a Saturday night. Our room was on the 4th floor and contained 2 double beds and a single, a large bathroom with bath and shower, tea and coffee and plenty of bottled water. Also on the 4th floor is the 'executive lounge' which has plenty of comfortable seating. This enabled us to sit around and relax with a bottle of vino before and after dinner without disturbing anyone. We didn't have dinner in the hotel but had breakfast Sunday morning which was top class and had plenty of variety as you would expect from a 4* hotel. Free underground parking was a huge plus. We really enjoyed our stay and will be back later in the year for our winter reunion!",4,2014,08,27
211,Excellent once again,"This is our third or fourth visit to the Croke park Hotel and yet again the hotel delivered, how this hotel only rates as a four star establishment is beyond me, it is certainly more comfortable then the so called 5 star hotel I stayed in in Brussels some years ago. The staff were excellent from the receptionists to the waiting staff in the Sideline Bistro unfortunately I did not get anyone's name but special mention must go to the Irish waitress with the long red hair, she was friendly approachable and nothing was to much trouble. We stayed at the hotel on a visit Dublin package which was great value for money, the package included staying in a superior room, two hop on hop off bus tickets, maps, guide book of Dublin, complimentary house cocktail and breakfast all for just 149 Euros fantastic value. We dined in the Sideline Bistro and had a superb meal and again, I think, great value we had a two course meal for three people including wine and coffee and this only came to 86 Euros. Our room was comfortable and well apportioned two double beds, TV, Wi-Fi, Tea coffee, hair dryer, and a wonderful bathroom. A great hotel and one that I will visit again no doubt.",5,2014,08,27
211,Top Service,I stayed here on business on the 4th floor. Great location for Airport and City. The service I received was some of the best I have ever had. Unfortunately I didn't get to eat but did sample the well stacked bar a couple times!,5,2014,08,26
211,"Great hotel, great value, great location!",I stayed here for one evening with my 3 children.  The hotel is in a great location allowing us to enjoy the sights of Dublin and have easy access to Dublin port.  The hotel is very comfortable and exceptional value. I wouldn't hesitate in recommending it to others. ,5,2014,08,26
211,Amazing as always,"Love this hotel. It feels like a home away from home. Staff are incredibly, food is great, rooms are perfect. 10 out of 10. 

Recommend that people make use of the dining facilities. Breakfast is so tasty and dinner is incredible too. 
      ",5,2014,08,26
211,Perfect for Business,"Really friendly staff, comfortable room, great location and great food. Really impressed with this place and also the Car PArking is Free and secuer which is a huge plus. One small point would be about breakfast, we ahd to wait 5 - 10 minutes for food to be replaced as they ran out, this caused us to basically skip breakfast but other than that, top class.",5,2014,08,26
211,Splendid,"The Croke Park Hotel is rather luxury than comfort. We were very impressed when we got into the room and from the surroundings. It is near the city center, it has great breakfast, clean rooms and good heating. It is great value for money!",5,2014,08,25
211,Lovely Dublin Value,"I had a wonderful 6-night stay! I booked a good deal on getaroom.com. This is a perfect spot if you're looking for a reasonable, clean hotel. Everyone there was friendly and helpful. It's right across the street from the hurling stadium, and about a mile walk to city center.  You have to dip your room key in the elevator to select your floor. Would stay again!",5,2014,08,23
211,"Poor location, bad plumbing",The bar staff were very friendly and it is a nice hotel inside but the water pressure is very bad in the bathroom.  It is not in the best area of town and we were not encouraged to walk in the area. Air conditioning could have been better.,3,2014,08,23
211,FAB HOTEL,"We arrived at this Hotel quite early but the very helpful reception staff were kind enough to let us go to the room after a very short wait. The room was fine- not outstandingly so, but very clean and comfortable. A few more drawers would be good! We wanted three single beds but the double and single was ok. 
There is a lovely gym, and access to internet and printer.
The food at the hotel was really excellent- we had breakfast (4 days), ate in the bar twice and in the restaurant. Really good. The Concierges are very helpful indeed and the shuttle bus into Dublin provides a great service. Highly recommend the green hop - on , hop-off bus- the guides give hilarious and entertaining info as you travel. 
The hotel is a good walk from O'Connell Street and probably not in the nicest part of Dublin to walk through at night. The taxis are plentiful and not too pricey.
We thoroughly enjoyed our trip to Dublin  - highly recommend this hotel, also the Riverdance show and the Merry Ploughboy for a night of Irish entertainment.
Thanks to all the staff at the Hotel who were outstandingly friendly and helpful. The food is fab and the hotel clean and comfortable. What else do you need?",5,2014,08,23
211,Tired and worn down,Got this hotel through exploring ireland vacations.  Neither the hotel nor exploring ireland are worth any consideration for future use.  The hotel is musty and old.  First room was smoky.  Rejected that. Area not looking safe for a walk.   I wouldn't come here again.,1,2014,08,22
211,match weekend,"we were pleasantly surprised at the efficiency and friendly manner in which the staff of this excellent hotel went about their duties in providing a memorable experience for us over a weekend in which 68,000 people attended a hurling game in the Croke Park stadium. Very impressive indeed! ",5,2014,08,22
211,A Dublin Delight,"This hotel is as good as it gets in Europe priced under 300 EUR per night.

Nice location, beautiful, spacious rooms, lots of shelf and storage space, great AC, firm beds, lots of hot water, nice towels and toiletries, etc. etc. etc.  You just cannot find fault with this hotel, or its staff, which is courteous and understands that it is their job to make you happy (so often lost in the tourism industry).

The dinners, while limited in choice, were very good, which is uncommon for a tour with 48 guests.  The breakfasts were outstanding.  

The next time I travel to Dublin, I'm staying here.  You should too.

DG",5,2014,08,21
211,Loved it!!,"Stayed here with my husband and 3 kids on a busy weekend and was very impressed.  Staff were more than helpful and very friendly. Rooms were very comfortable, and well equiped. Food was amazing in the restaurant.  Will definitely return.",5,2014,08,21
211,Yet again another wonderful experience,"This is not the first time I have stayed at this hotel, and it certainly won’t be the last. I have stayed both as a business guest and for personal reasons and each experience has been excellent. Many of my colleagues also use this Hotel for business on a regular basis, and it is one of the staff favourites for a hotel stay in Dublin, and always a winner. The staff is extremely friendly & helpful, and happy to accommodate your needs, always with a smile. The rooms are always spotless, and very spacious, with comfortable beds you are guaranteed a great night’s sleep. The room service is also very efficient, and the breakfast quite tasty. 
I always love little extras like a hot towel upon arrival at reception, and complimentary bottles of water when leaving; it gives it those little extra touches. 
The bar is in a gorgeous setting and again I have to praise the staff in the bar, and the food there is always fantastic - well worth testing. 
For a 4* hotel, it provides better service than some 5* establishments I have stayed in around Ireland, and that is no doubt down to the Management & staff of this hotel. A fantastic well run establishment that a lot of hotels in Dublin should take the lead from.
The location is also very central and is only 7/8 mins via taxi from the train station, and also boasts it's own cark park for convenience. ",5,2014,08,20
211,20 min walk to city center,"If your looking for a hotel with great service, clean rooms and within walking distance of the city this is the one. Rooms are spacious and really clean, very comfy beds!!!!  The food in the bar is good I've had the burger & the Cesar salad , both were delicious. Fully equipped gym also great staff with lots of info about the area. The only downside is the location , not the best area but as long as your not walking down by the canal at night on your own you will be fine!!!! Will be back.",4,2014,08,19
211,croke park hotel stay,"The hotel and it's staff is first class. You are made feel very welcome the minute you arrive till the minute you check out. Couldn't find a fault even if I tried. Rooms are very clean and the food was beautiful,.

      
      ",5,2014,08,19
211,Excellent hotel,"This is a great hotel. It's easy to get to the airport, it's easy to get to town using the tour bus.
It's quiet, the room is very well equipped and comfortable. The staff are very helpful, the breakfast is excellent (e.g. porridge is made with milk, unlike other more expensive hotels). Finally the price is reasonable.
OK it's not right in town (do you need the noise?) and it might not be the place to stay before a match if you're just a tourist otherwise it's pretty much perfect.",5,2014,08,19
211,Wonderful Stay,"Stayed here for one night before going to the hurling semifinal in Croke Park the following day. Booked online direct with the hotel (worth doing) and got a reasonable b&b deal with some extras. From start to finish, this was a great stay. Friendly, warm welcome at check in, fab superior double room - very clean, great extra touches in the room - fruit platter ect, delicious meal in the bar that evening, great waiter - nothing was too much trouble, breakfast was really nice despite being fully booked and very busy - it didn't feel that way, late check out 2pm, plenty safe parking, free wifi, kids loved the complimentary hot choc in exec lounge. Although we paid a premium to stay on a match night - it was worth every penny and I will definately be back and will be recommending this hotel. Staff are great. Well done. ",5,2014,08,18
211,Child friendly excellent hotel with superb staff,"We have just spent 6 days at this hotel with our 10month old son and thought the staff were wonderful! The two members of staff in the executive lounge, the servers in the bar and the ladies who serviced the rooms were particularly lovely.
We all slept brilliantly in the room in the best quality bed and bed linen.
The bar and bistro have great food on offer, although almost everything is very rich and heavy (even the salads) and there could be room for some more healthy/plain stuff on there (i.e. a simple green salad as a side order - without being smothered in mayonnaise, cheese, or sauce). Nevertheless, we were able to eat there most nights and the staff were so helpful in providing small bowls of food for our baby - brilliant!
Fruit & water in the room most days was great, as was the turn down service and the use of the executive lounge. The added touch of a card and complimentary prosecco for my birthday and complimentary drinks each evening were lovely extras.
The only issue that really came up was the inefficiency of the card keys when getting back in the lift after a good day out. They were extremely unpredictable and we had to return to reception several times to have them recharged, despite keeping them away from credit cards etc as advised.
It's a bit of a walk to the centre, but that helps work off all the food and drink!! 
The perfect place to stay if you have little ones. ",4,2014,08,18
211,Nice hotel,"Stayed at the Croke Park hotel with my two older children, while vacationing in Dublin for the first time. Coming from the states after a long plane trip and a early arrival. The staff was wonderful and let us check in way before the standard check-in. All of the staff excluding the concierge were very helpful. He acted like our questions were a bother and to be honest, flat out rude! Would stay here again, but would take any questions to another member of the team.",4,2014,08,17
211,Very good hotel,"Nice staff, exellent room. 6 minutes walk from the busstation at Drumcondra station. The Croke Park hotel in Dublin is a perfect hotel for you're trip. The concierge gives you good advices for a tour, he makes the reservation. 
      ",5,2014,08,17
211,Awesome place!,"This was our first stop upon arriving in Ireland.  What a treat to be greeted with respect and courtesy that felt genuine rather than required.  The staff were very helpful and friendly, the hotel was clean and comfortable, breakfast was awesome, etc. etc.  We have nothing bad to report.....our stay was fabulous!  Our last stop in Ireland was not any where near this experience so ultimately we were wishing we ended our trip at Croke Park.......a BIG thank you to the Croke Park Hotel for starting our trip to Ireland on the highest note!!",5,2014,08,16
211,Wonderful,"Just returned from a 2 night stay with my 2 sons, I cannot fault this hotel in any way, all the staff from the moment we arrived were excellent, a special thank you to the concierge staff who went the extra mile to ensure we had a good stay.  Rooms were excellent, spotless and spacious. We cannot wait to return.  The only place I will stay in Dublin from now on.   One last thing Alma was lovely with my 11 year old Son, he was a bit homesick and she made him feel much better.",5,2014,08,16
211,Nice hotel but...,Not in a great neighborhood. At least a fifteen minute walk to downtown. One of the tour buses does stop there every morning but otherwise it's a €10 cab ride. The room was nice but small. Looks like it was renovated within the last few years. If you are attending an event at the stadium this is a great place to stay otherwise there seemed to be better options downtown. Front desk staff was VERY helpful and friendly. ,3,2014,08,16
211,A great hotel,"I stayed in this hotel for 3 nights with my husband, 2 girls (7 & 3 years old) and 6 month old baby.  Rooms were comfy, clean and spacious.  Bathrooms had a shower and a separate bath and still wasn't cramped.  Access to the executive lounge for tea and juice was a nice touch rather than using the facilities in the room.  The girls loved making hot chocolate.  Breakfast was lovely, self service which I find better with my kids as they can pick what they want. 
Having to use you room key card to work the lifts was a bit tricky but you soon get the hang of it.",5,2014,08,15
211,Family,"Had great time .. Could fault nothing 
Family of 5 
Rooms v spacious ...
Little bit of walk to town but used hop on hop off service...
Pity no entertainment in bar at night but other than that staff were so helpful and friendly.. Will definitely return

211,Lack of relax,We booked a family room for fourpoints and we hace a room with 2 beds of 135 cm. Only 2 towels. Very small room for four. Very bussy and Noisy for gaélic football weekend. Very expensive i guess for the same reason. Poor relax. ,2,2014,08,14
211,Service,"I stay at the hotel regularly and I  just want to complement Alma on breakfast service for noticing my regular order and putting it together for me this morning unprompted
A nice touch and very much appreciated",4,2014,08,14
211,Great value,"The Croke Park hotel offers exceptional value for money. I assume that most guests, like me, would regard visiting Croke Park as something of a pilgrimage. If that is so then the fact that the hotel is literally across the road from the stadium is a great advantage. It is a little distance from the city centre and I would recommend getting a bus or taxi into the city centre as opposed to walking. The rooms are large and comfortable. Our package included breakfast which made it even better value. Apart from a minor gripe about one of our steaks being more under-done then asked for (which was professionally dealt with by management) dinner in the restaurant was a pleasant experience. I didn’t get the chance to visit the gym but a quick perusal from the outside suggested that it was above average. I recommend the open top bus tour, Kilmainham jail, Croke Park (obviously) and Temple Bar. Free wi-fi as ever is a great advantage.",4,2014,08,14
211,"Clean, bright hotel with large rooms and nice amenities","Really enjoyed our 4-night stay at the Croke Park Hotel.  It was our home base as we (family of 4) visited Dublin and took day trips out in the country.  A bit crazy on game day (it was the national playoffs the day we arrived) since the hotel is across the street from the Croke Park stadium.  Otherwise a real gem.  A longish but easy walk to either Glasnevin Cemetery or into City Centre.  The hotel even provides bicycles if you'd rather ride.  We didn't try the food at the hotel because there were too many other great options nearby.  We were on a budget and had been staying at 2- and 3-star places, so a 4-star hotel with air conditioning and free wifi for a comparable price was a real treat!",5,2014,08,13
211,great place to stay,"On arrival at the croke park hotel our first impression was the location an was very easy to find once inside we got a very warm welcome at reception an given information about  the hotel and how to earn credits...staff were very friendly and helpful,we wil definitely return to the hotel again an have already recommended the croke park hotel to family and friends...the room was really well presented ,clean and comfortable a really enjoyable stay all round for the family with taxi's available close by so thank you to the croke park hotel and will look forward to staying with you again.",5,2014,08,13
211,"Nice, clean hotel with friendly staff","We stayed here on the last night of a group tour. The rooms were big and clean. The bed was comfortable and unlike many hotels we stayed at in Ireland, it had air conditioning. When I turned on my TV no channels came in so I called the front desk and within 2 minutes someone was at my door. Turns out a cable was missing so the gentleman went and got one and had the TV working within 10 minutes of me making the call, I will say it's outside of the city center and it was about a 10-15 minute walk before you would get to the center so if you are looking for a hotel centrally located, this isn't it. This hotel is next to the stadium and there were 2 games there the evening we stayed so we were worried about how busy they would be and the noise level. When we came back from exploring Dublin, we walked in and could hear a huge crowd of people in the lobby but were happy to see that once we got to our rooms, we couldn't hear them at all. We were worried about what the wait for dinner would be like given the crowd we could hear but went down to the restaurant. The bar was jammed packed, but we noticed they had the bistro roped off and when we went to ask about dinner, saw they were leaving it open for guests and that the sport crowd was restricted to the bar. We went into the restaurant and the noise level diminished and we were able to have a nice dinner. The food was fantastic and the service was great. We had a nice sleep and even though the bar and lobby were packed with people, we didn't hear them at all. Would recommend this hotel for those who are okay with a walk or cab ride to the city center.",5,2014,08,12
211,Loved this hotel,Very friendly and helpful staff. The room accomadation was excellent. The breakfast was very good. I stayed at this hotel with my family because we were going to a match in Croke Park. This hotel will be my first choice in to the future for any event in Dublin. Thanks to the management and staff for making my stay with my family a very enjoyable one.,5,2014,08,12
211,Great!,"If you don't mind a bit of a walk to the city center this is a really great hotel with excellent service and very nice rooms. The hotel is situated next to the Cork Park Stadium but other than that is it a very calm neighborhood 
      ",4,2014,08,12
211,"Good hotel, poor bar service","We stayed here for a few nights when we first got to Dublin.  It's a convenient location, you can walk to the city, no real public bus goes there, there is one bus that drops you at the end of the street and it's a short walk to the hotel.  Enterprise car rental is very close to the hotel and there is a self service laundry close by.  The Croke Park Stadium has an excellent tour as well.  
We stayed on level 4 which is the Executive floor, but found the executive lounge generally over run by families, and was not cleaned very often.  They also didn't replenish items very often, or perhaps we just got there after the families had taken everything.  The continental breakfast was fine, but there is no toaster if you wish your bread toasted.
We didn't experience good service in the Sideline Bar, we had a lot of trouble attracting bar staff to be served, even though the area wasn't busy.  One waiter in particular seemed to go out of his way to ignore us, not sure if it was because we were only getting a desert and our free complimentary drink, so didn't consider us important to serve.  ",4,2014,08,11
211,Wonderful hotel,"There's something about this hotel. I have stayed there 5 times before. Being Kilkenny fans, we are often in and around Drumcondra but whenever we are in Dublin we choose this place. It is a beautiful hotel. Spotlessly clean, modern facilities etc... It is the staff that make this palace though. Nothing is too much and everything they do for you seems like a genuine pleasure. Not massively convenient for Dublin City Centre if that's what you've come to see, but only a 20 minute walk if it is why you've come.",5,2014,08,11
211,Excellent hotel,A very clean and friendly hotel. The rooms are done to a high standard and the hotel is generally excellent. The breakfast was a particular highlight. Also go and see a hurling match if one is on during your stay. ,5,2014,08,11
211,Great hotel just too expensive,Everything about this hotel is great in terms of comfort and cleanliness but I have a huge problem with hotels that hike up their prices the weekend of a gaa match and this is so not fair.It is so expensive for Irish people to go to these games without this rip off.On principal alone I have decided not to stay here in the future but good luck to whoever can .Have been going to this hotel for years but this is the end of my relationship with it,4,2014,08,11
211,Fantastic hotel fantastic staff,"My 2 sister in laws and I stayed here for the August bank holiday weekend and we were not let down one bit. The hotel itself is outstanding from start to finish , even for a busy weekend all staff seemed to provide a great service. We had top class not cheap but fantastic food before we headed for the match across the road. The waitress who looked after us in the restaurant Sophie I'm sure was very friendly and courteous . Also Ronan  who served us the 3 baileys coffees even though it was extremely late and still busy epitomised the service we received . It was a thoroughly enjoyable experience all round , were all looking forward to our return visit. Up the kingdom . Joan Killarney ",5,2014,08,10
211,Stop here FIRST in Ireland,"When you come to Ireland via Dublin, the Croke Park Hotel should be your first stop.  It has everything....location, fabulous staff, good eating options on site, tremendous help about how to spend your time in the city and how to get there.  We had a wonderful rest the first night and added additional things to do from their suggestions.  Simply outstanding.",5,2014,08,10
211,Boutique luxury in Dublin - also great for families,"We had only one night in The Croke Park, and we wish we'd had more. It truly feels like a luxury hotel at a very reasonable price. As other reviewers have stated, the family room (2 double beds and a single) is a perfect option for a family of four, and the staff are friendly and accommodating. We actually ended up eating in the hotel restaurant that night, due to our late arrival, and the food was very good - staff in the restaurant even friendlier. (One waitress patiently wrote down a few key Irish phrases for us while we were waiting for our food.) Free parking underground and a fantastic location (not right in city center, but an easy 15-minute walk) make this an ideal choice for families visiting the city.",5,2014,08,10
211,Dublin,"Very good Hotel, 15min walk to the City Centre, dublin is Worth to visit for Some days. Public Transfer is Not  Easy to Unverstand for foreigners but weather was brillant und People Are very Nixe. Breakfast at the Hotel was extraordinary.",5,2014,08,10
211,Excellent quality hotel for family of 5,The hotel was excellent quality the rooms were nice and comfortable and it made a great end of our Tour of Ireland.  We enjoyed the amenities offered by the hotel including Dining in on a rainy Friday evening.  The food was tasteful and provided yet another glimpse into the Irish culture.,5,2014,08,09
211,Luxurious hotel near Dublin airport,"We were impressed with the comfort, design and amenities of this hotel near the Dublin airport. The food at the Sideline Bar was also very good (steak sandwich and skinny fries!).  Free parking underground, and the family room (2 double beds, 1 single bed) was the perfect accommodation for my family of 4.
      ",5,2014,08,09
211,Outstanding Hotel,"We were looking for a nice hotel in Dublin, with car parking facilities for a family of four, with two teenage sons. We were made to feel really welcome and were given early access to one of our 2 adjoining rooms, so we could drop our luggage and make the most of our day in Dublin.
On arrival back to our rooms later in the day, the pre ordered bouquet of flowers for my wife on our anniversary were waiting along with a complimentary bucket of sparkling wine and 2 glasses with a lovely card from the hotel management wishing us all the best. A great touch..
Went to visit the GAA Museum before we left the following day and were able to keep the car in the car park until we were ready to leave later in the day.
First class staff and facilities and will definitely go back.",5,2014,08,08
211,"It was ""fine"".","My partner and I stayed here as a convenient stop in Dublin before we  headed North. We were driving so we needed to find a hotel with secure parking - Croke Park Hotel fitted the bill. The hotel was fine. It's location wasn't great if you want to explore the city centre - an €8 cab journey in, but I guess that's what you get for needing a parking space. The room was fine aswell. Nothing particularly special - a standard mass catered for hotel room lacking a bit in character, but clean and comfy. And the staff were fine too. 

We headed off early and as it wasn't included in our room rate, we skipped breakfast. I'm sure it would've been fine!

So in conclusion? It's fine.",3,2014,08,07
211,Highly Recommended,"Excellent service throughout our 4 night stay, the staff are friendly and helpful.
Rooms are very clean and spacious, with very comfortable beds.The bar and restaurant staff are very friendly. We were treated to a free breakfast when we told them it was our wedding anniversary, and there was champagne on ice in our room when we returned that evening. Lovely touch. Denise & Vin",5,2014,08,07
211,"This hotel is very clean, staff are very helpful and service is efficient.",I stayed at this hotel with my daughter in May 2014 for a concert. Staff very pleasant and helpful. Great for kids. Very good breakfast buffet. Rooms spacious and immaculate. Would definitely recommend,5,2014,08,06
211,"Fantastic value, beautiful place","Though Croke Park is a little out of the way (about 20 mins walk to downtown), it's absolutely worth it. It's by far one of the most affordable options, but you wouldn't know it. The hotel is clean, they got us a quiet room, the rooms are beautifully appointed with good technology and comfy beds.

The staff are tremendously kind and helpful. I had to ask for help several times and they were accomodating and warm.  Oh, and the breakfast buffet was pretty good - not blow your mind good but a very large variety of food for the price.  

Great place to stay - much recommended.",5,2014,08,06
211,Great place to stay,"Loved this hotel, clean, nice room, good location, even though not near city center.  The dining room was pleasant and had excellant food.  We were right across the street from Croke arena for sports fans.  The front desk employees were friendly and made check in and out speedy.",4,2014,08,06
211,We'll be back!,"We booked this hotel the night before we travelled to Dublin on a whim with the intention of staying 1 night., (Party of 2 adults, 4 kids, aged 11 to 4). After spending the day at the zoo we checked into the hotel at 6pm looking a little ""dusty"", instead of being eyeballed we were given lovely warm lemon scented face cloths!! From then until the time we left, (2 days later!!)  we were looked after to the highest of standards. We had 2 double, 1 single and 1 fold out bed in the room and still had plenty of space. We celebrated our daughters 11th birthday in the restaurant and the staff were most obliging by putting a candle in her dessert and making a fuss. Breakfast was by far one of the best we've been offered in a hotel. The staff overall were so helpful and attentive and really friendly especially when dealing with the kids. We were so lucky that we got to stay for a second night and look forward to a return very soon. ",5,2014,08,05
211,Excellent hotel in top location.,"I stayed one night in July 2014.  The room was excellent, with clean modern furnishings and comfortable beds, and a good-sized ensuite.  Staff were helpful and knowledgeable, both on the reception desk and throughout the hotel.  Breakfast was plentiful and hot, with a good cup of tea served!  The best point of this hotel is location, just a few minutes from my business meeting the following morning, away from city-centre traffic, and parking is included in the room rate.  I would definitely stay here again, and would recommend the Croke Park Hotel to anyone.",5,2014,08,05
211,"Good hotel, not so good location.","Modern hotel, relatively spacious rooms and accommodating staff. Check-in was efficient and friendly and so was check-out. A complimentary water bottle upon departure is a nice touch as was the warm towel upon arrival. The concierges were attentive and helpful, although on this occasion their suggestions for restaurants and trips were less than happy -- nevertheless, they obviously made an effort. Breakfast is OK but could easily be improved, the warm stuff - The Irish Breakfast - comes across as mass produced and stands in contrast to the very individualized service at the front desk. It should be noted that for someone who is in Dublin as a tourist, the hotel is a bit of a walk from the center; count 25 minutes to get to the south end of O'Connell street. And should you decide to walk back at night, beware that some of the nearby neighborhoods are a bit sketchy. For those arriving from the airport, the hotel is at the right end of the city. And its not far from Connelly station. The hotel sits right across the road from Croke Park (a sports arena with 80 000 seats) so those in the mood for a quite weekend are well advised to have a look at the sports calendar to check if their plans might crash with a major event (unless your a hurling fan, of course).",4,2014,08,05
211,Value for money,Had a brilliant stay in hotel. E had booked a triple family room - one double and single bed. On arrival we asked and got a triple family room with two double beds and one single. Ice machine in corridor outside room. Room/bathroom and facilities very clean. Breakfast at €12 each was very plentiful. 10 minute walk into town centre. Very courteous staff. Excellent value for money.  Would definitely recommend and will most definitely stay here again.  ,5,2014,08,05
211,Top  hotel on our trip,"Though not in a great location,  we were close to many tourist sites.  The hotel was outstanding, the rooms modern and clean. The breakfast buffet was only bested by the Skellig in Dingle.  We all slept well and would come here again.",5,2014,08,04
211,Regular guests,"We've stayed here on numerous occasions and we love it. We are a family of 5 and it's great to be able to book family rooms. The breakfast is always excellent ,huge choice and excellent service. Check in and check out are always prompt. We checked out at 4:30am last week for an early morning flight. The night manager was friendly and quick! I also stayed here during the one direction concerts back in May and I've been meaning to write a review since then. It was so busy and crazy,full of fun atmosphere and a great buzz about the place. We loved it. We will be returning again soon and we wouldn't even look to stay anywhere else in Dublin.",5,2014,08,04
211,Good hotel,"Stayed in a superior double with 2 double beds.  Had a fantastic night's sleep as the beds were super comfy.  Reasonable size room, very clean and great bathroom. This is more of a business hotel, but, as such, the facilities were brilliant, especially the business centre which meant we could print off our boarding passes etc.  Good selection at breakfast.  It is a 10 minute walk into town, so convenient, but be warned it is directly opposite Croke Park, so I would imagine it could get very noisy at night if there was a concert/sports event on and when there are events/matches on the road to the hotel is closed to traffic.",4,2014,08,04
211,Great hotel and staff!,"We stayed at the Croke Park hotel for 4 nights, and it was overall a very good experience. The hotel is well maintained and very clean. The staff were very nice and attentive - we asked to change rooms to have one large bed (beyond what we booked),  and we got upgraded to the executive floor, which has some nice benefits. The point is that the whole thing was brought up by the staff, our luggage was moved for us, and they even appologized for any inconvenience! 

The room itself was large, well equipped and clean. We happened to see several rooms and they all seemed to be similarly sized. The rooms on the executive floor are not larger, but you do get access to a lounge with free coffee, drinks and snacks.

Breakfast room is nice and really helped to get a good start for each day. Here too the service was nice, friendly and fast.

The only minor downside for this great hotel is perhaps it's location - somewhat away from the main attractions south of the river, to which you can get by a quick and easy bus ride from the station,some 5-10 minutes walk from the hotel. I wouldn't recommend walking all the way back to the hotel after the unavoidable late night pub crawl, when there are no buses. Instead, take a cab - these would rarely exceed 10€.

All things considered, this is a very good hotel,and gives superb value for money. 

I would definitely come back again, unless my employer (or someone else) is willing to cover the ridiculously high rates of the more centrally located, yet equivalent in service and room quality, major chain hotels.",5,2014,08,03
211,Excellent. ,"Excellent hotel and the staff are brilliant, cannot do enough for the guests. Rooms are good size, food is excellent and well priced. Special mention to Pascale Joyeaux for providing excellent service. We keep going back, cannot recommend highly enough. ",5,2014,08,03
211,Only stayed here to go to a concert,"I stayed here with my daughter to see One Direction in the venue next door.  The check in was hectic, and room wasn't ready on arrival, with no queue system for allocating rooms in order of arrival.  Our room was OK but nothing to write home about, and we paid a premium price for it well in advance.  A leaflet in the room boasted family break rates for a family of 4 for 2 nights that included breakfast etc, for half what we paid for 2 of us in a twin room for one night with no breakfast included.  The hotel appeared to cash in on the concert to charge the highest rate they could.  We were warned in advance, by email, about problems accessing the hotel by car after a certain time, but Were given absolutely no warning about the street that the hotel is on being closed off AFTER the concert, with the police not letting residents back to the hotel, for quite some time.  My daughter almost wet herself as we were told that the toilets were closed after the concert as we made our way out of the venue, but we knew our hotel was right next door so we weren't overly concerned, until we reached a barricade and were stopped yards away from our hotel whilst the venue crowds filtered out.  (If you attend a concert whilst staying at this hotel, make sure you book the stand that exits onto the street that the hotel is on, otherwise you will be blockaded back from the hotel for approximately half an hour).   When we took up this issue with door staff a manager or supervisor came forward to inform us that this was out of their control yet he admitted that they knew this would be a problem based on complaints the previous night (after the same concert) and had not bothered to advise guests checking in that there was an access issue post-concert.  This would have been very helpful!
Location wise it is a good 20 minute hike through the side streets of Drumcondra to get to O'Connell St.  Not the most scenic walk, nor a walk I would fancy taking late at night!   Taxis to and from the City Centre were a reasonable price though.
The food in the restaurant was very nice, but quite pricey.  They laid on a One Direction menu for fans/kids when we stayed as everyone appeared to be a concert-goer!  It was a nice touch. The decor in the restaurant was not in keeping with the prices, however the restaurant staff were efficient and very friendly.  
Free parking for residents was good, however as we'd paid a lot (more than 250 euro) for one night room only, this was the least they could do.
I would not stay here again, unless I got a really good rate, and only if I was going next door for a concert.  It's not central, which was not reflected in the pricing, which leads me to think it makes it's money from concert goers.  ",3,2014,08,03
211,Great location. Modern hotel. ,"This was the base for our Dublin visit. The location is about two miles from the historic area. It's clean and modern, much like a good Courtyard. Free parking was a big deal to us. The staff was helpful on tourist advice. We had a passable breakfast in the restaurant. ",4,2014,08,02
211,PLUSH HOTEL/UN-PLUSH PRICE,"As you know, the Professor always likes a bargain, but never at the expense of his creature comfort. The Croke Park delivers on all fronts. A really slick hotel with extremely well-appointed rooms--big tub, soft robes and slippers, and a bed that's hard to get out of. For all those whinging about the location, really? If you want to be in Disneyland, go to Disneyland. Please. It's called a neighborhood. Enjoy it. Don't be a buffoon. If you enjoy a local experience, make a left out of the hotel and imbibe in the local flavor; if you prefer your stay sanitized, make a right and head unscathed--yes, unscathed, people--to the Temple Bar area and buy your snow globes. Croke Park is an excellent hotel with fantastic prices in a location close to the city center. 'Nuf said.",5,2014,08,02
211,GREAT Customer Service,"The front desk was very friendly. Breakfast was delicious. The rooms were spotless & good size for a family of four. The location is perfect - right inside the city. If we ever go back, this is the only hotel we will stay at. In the heart of Dublin, but not directly in the hustle & bustle. Quieter area, very clean. Highly recommend for anyone wishing to visit Dublin. Very secure as they have added security which made us even more comfortable. The hop on hop off bus picks you up right at the hotel, recommend doing this is it's your first time there. Also, you can buy those tickets at the hotel for a discounted price.",5,2014,08,02
211,Excellent hotel,"I have stayed in the croke park hotel on several occasions, the staff and facilities in the hotel are excellent. Complimentary drink in the evening and bottles of water when we left are nice touches that guests remember. 

Rooms spotlessly clean. Food excellent. ",5,2014,08,02
211,"Excellent Hotel, not great location to walk into town though!","Toured Southern Ireland 21-28 July 2014 (with 3 days in Oldcastle Co.Meath for business, 4 days touring). This review is part of that tour; where we ate, visited & stayed.

  This hotel is very good and very resonably priced.  It is opposite Croke Park Stadium so was fully packed out prior to our tour so we just booked our hotels as we toured. Glad we did do that because a singer called Gareth Crookes or Brookes cancelled his tour and most people then cancelled there bookings and left the hotel empty!!! We booked night before getting into Dublin and got a free upgrade to EXECUTIVE status.  This included access to floor 4 where the executive lounge was and where the breakfast was.  The breakfast was continental and the fridges were full of milk, orange juice, and water which you had access to 24hours.

  This was a bonus and a great way to start the stay. Check in was very quick and painless, the room was clean and modern with a seperate bath and shower.

  Overall the bar area and hotel were very clean and light and airy.

  We wanted to do the hop-on-hop off bus tour so asked what stop we could catch it from.  Luckily the hotel does a shuttle service which takes you to O'Connell Street (start of tour) for free as long as you have a ticket. It goes every 30minutes into town until about 3pm. The ticket last for 2 consecutive days for when when first activated on the machines on the bus. We only needed it for 1day so gave our ticket away to another couple to use for the last day. The tickets can be brought from the hotel for €18 each for an adult (I think!) and can be charged to your room.

  Someone has mentioned that the walk into town is not pleasant, and I know what they mean. You basically have to walk for about 15minutes through the local area, past chicken shops with local youths standing around and council estates and quite(ish) streets before you see the tourist area. Coming from London I would not want to be an outsider walking the local streets.  Me and the girlfriend ahd no issues walking into town whilst early and light (5pmish) but would not walk back to hotel in the evening/dark.  I would recommend all to get a cab back to the hotel in the evening from O'Connell Street and it costs €9 per cab. YOUR CHOICE.

  Anyway we did a few bars and restaurants in Dublin and can say it was very enjoyable.

  The staff got our final bill wrong and charged us a rate which was too hiogh even though the upgrade was free and complimentary.  We queried this and it was rectified immediatly and without hoo-har.

  On our return to England my girlfriend got a 'tell us about your stay' email and she put on there about the bill and the staff member asked if she could call my girlfriend. The girlfriend asaid yes and she got a call from the staff member (sorry cannot ask girlfriend who it was at time of typing this) apologising again for the mistake.

  Now every business makes mistakes now and then and they are the norm......it is how they are dealt with that is the defining thing that seperates hotels.  This is excellent customer service and we will be returning to this hotel beginning of next year when we return to Dublin.

  So, in summary, excellent hotel decor, excellent service, executive upgrade a nice touch, bit of a poor area to walk through to get into town (easily rectified with a cheap taxi for safety) and I am sure this hotel will rise up the TA table if it continues in this fashion.

  You will not be disappointed staying here...and thanks to Garth Brookes for cancelling his concert!!!!!!!",4,2014,08,01
211,Fab hotel,"A truly fantastic hotel in Dublin, very reasonably priced and close to O'Connell street (10 min walk), staff are great and will go out of their way to meet your needs, rooms are clean and we'll kept and breakfast is fantastic.

211,"Fantastic hotel, shame about location.","This is the second time that we have stayed in this hotel and thoroughly enjoyed the experience on both occasions.

If there is any criticism, it is the location. It is located directed across from the stadium,  it is not especially near desired locations.

211,Who needs Garth Brooks?,"We had an Executive room, with access to the Executive lounge....and what a lounge. Complimentary drinks and snacks all day, but the continental breakfast was amazing. A feast of smoked salmon, cold cuts, cheeseboard, pastries, dried fruit, plus all the usual fare. The bedroom was kept at a lovely temperature, the bathroom had both a bath and walk-in shower (nice to see facecloths). Very attentive staff and good food in the bar, at competitive prices.

211,My first choice in Dublin!,This hotel is such a gem!.  We enjoyed absolutely everything about our stay.  The rooms were very nice and the beds so comfortable.  Every staff member we dealt with in all areas were so exceptionally competent and friendly.  We did stay at other highly rated hotels in Dublin and would probably choose the Croke Park again as our first choice.,5,2014,07,25
211,Excellent hotel. A 15-min walk to city center,"We stayed 2 nights July-2014 (2 rooms). The rooms are spacious, spotless, everything looks new, clean and white. There is a bath + a shower. Good beds and a quiet neighborhood for a good night sleep. Free parking.
Free Wi-Fi. Excellent breakfast was included.
The staff was very friendly and willing to help.
The only drawback we found was the 15-minute walk to city center which to some may be long. A taxi from Temple Bar is about EU 9.00.
Summing up: Great! Would definitely stay again.",5,2014,07,24
211,Great Get Away,"We chose this hotel primarily because we read in the reviews, that it had good parking facilities. Since we arrived late, we didn't want to search for a car park in the middle of the night with our rental car. 
The welcome upon arrival was very friendly with a smile, hot refreshing towels and good information. The room was clean, comfortable and large. With the city bus tour ticket and the stop right in front of the hotel, it took us only a few minutes into town. 
Great value for your money, great hotel, very friendly staff! We'd choose it again on another occasion!",5,2014,07,24

A good bar and restaurant - I watched a few world cup games there and enjoyed it - can recommend the ribs. Quiet hotel at night, great staff at the check in counter. The only thing I didn't like is there are no amenities in the neighbourhood and it's a longish and not great walk into the city centre.

From the moment we checked in from our trans Atlantic flight, being rather tired, we were pampered by the staff.  The room was large and extremely well appointed, even a trouser press!  While the ""queen"" sized bed was a little smaller than we are used to it was comfortable with very nice bed linens.  Tea, coffee are available in the room.  We appreciated having free WiFi and free parking in a city hotel.  The breakfast buffet was amazing with everything one could wish for.  Evening meals in the restaurant were equally satisfying.",5,2014,07,22

Check in was by a very friendly and helpful young lady (Sandra?) and nothing disappointed. Wifi was good in the room. We were allocated the disabled room but had no complaints as we did check in early and were grateful to have a room. The executive lounge was well worth the extra charge.

211,"Wonderful room. Sandra, was especially helpfull and lovely!!!","First visit to Ireland, made awesome and comfortable by the Croke park staff.   Staff was helpfull in everyway!  No request was too small for their helpfullness.  Loved the location. Really comfy room. Can't wait to go back.!!! Thank you all for a wonderfull visit.",5,2014,07,19
211,Nice hotel,"Different area for location. But the place was really nice.  Staff, rooms and food were great. Very easy to walk into downtown Dublin. Rooms were clean and there was a nice big tub to soak in after a long day of sightseeing. ",5,2014,07,18
211,"Good value, so-so location","This is a well appointed hotel with large rooms, great service, great breakfast (extra) and a very good bang for the buck. However, if you're looking for a hotel that is convenient to downtown Dublin this might not be your place.  It is situated in a semi-industrial area and it's about a 20 minute walk into the city.

My friend and I are both big travelers so we knew this going into it and it didn't bother us a bit. In fact, it was nice to have a long walk in the morning and after a night of drinking and eating.

Cautionary note: since this hotel is literally across from the huge Croke Park Stadium, I can imagine that the area is a bit of a madhouse during concerts and sporting events. 

Overall our five night stay was great. The bathroom shower leaked water all over our bathroom floor every time we showered and it was fixed promptly. Plenty of closet space and the bed was very comfortable. I always forget to bring a face cloth with me when traveling to Europe so don't forget it as none of the hotels provide one.",4,2014,07,18
211,Beautiful fantasic gorgeous,Stayed here in May with my best friend for a girls weekend. Wow service from the staff second to none. Rooms beautiful with gorgeous comfy beds and a shower and bath. Food in the resterraunt fantastic the fillet steak was to die for and the apple crumble was evil and decadent. Would I recommend this hotel. HELL YEAH,5,2014,07,16
211,great stay - good value,"My wife & I stayed here for our 1st trip to Ireland at the end of June. I had researched the hotels & found the Croke Park Hotel as one of the top tripadvisor rated hotels in Dublin & booked our stay here as the rates were reasonable & the reviews were good. Check in was easy & we were able to get a room even though it was 12:30pm. 
The hotel is modern & appears very well-kept.

We had a superior double bed room which appeared clean & in good condition. We were staying for 10 nights but had noticed that the fire alarm in the ceiling was making very random chirping noises during the night that made getting a good nights sleep difficult. Also the double bed was slightly uncomfortable due to lack of some support in the center. We were taking day trips each day & were coming home around 9:30pm for the 1st 3 nights. We reported the chirping alarm after the 2nd night & were able to move to a new room when we returned for the day on the 4th night - the front desk was friendly & assigned us a new room on the 2nd floor. 

We were pleased to find a nice superior queen bed room that had a nice patio that we never ventured out to & the bed had much better support -  we slept so well in that room. We had an issue with getting our complimentary water for all the nights after we switched rooms. We had complained to the front desk but for some reason, housekeeping would not stock our room with the water. It was a little bit of a hassle to call the front desk & ask them to send some water to our room each night after returning from our long days of sightseeing for the remainder of our stay. The staff lady who brought our waters was extremely nice & courteous - she was the same one sent to our room each night but always arrived with a friendly smile. The staff at the hotel was always friendly & appeared genuinely concerned with our well-being.

The business center is down in the lobby & easily accessible for surfing the internet, online bookings, & printing boarding passes.

The location of the hotel is a little way out from most tourist areas & may be on the edge of a rougher area. We were told by the cab drivers that it may not be ideal for walking around at night for safety reasons. We took cabs the 1st few nights but bought a leap card pass & used the bus system most of the rest of our trip. We would take a cab if we were in a hurry or if it was dark out but the sun set very late at this time & we still felt safe walking home from the Drumcondra bus stop around 9:30-10pm at night as there was still very good light out & quite a few people walking & cars driving on the walk back to the hotel. There was only one time when we walked home along the canal behind the stadium when it was getting dark that we felt we could have picked an unsafe route - avoid walking along the canal at night & you should be ok.

If you do visit the Croke Park stadium, please let them know that you are staying at the Croke Park hotel & you get a discount. The stadium is so close by & worth visiting. The entrance to the stadium is not the one directly in front of the hotel.",4,2014,07,14
211,"Nice, convenient hotel in Dublin","Stayed for 2 nights in early June 2014.  The room was clean and spacious with everything worked in the bathroom!  There is not much around, but the hotel is within 10 minutes walk to the city.  The hop-on hop-off pick up bus stopped right in front of the hotel an took us to the city centre.

There is only one dining room and a bar which served nice, simple bar food which I enjoyed very much.  The bar staff was very nice too.

As I was leaving at 7 am the next morning, I requested a wake-up call at 6 am.  The call never came - luckily I was able to wake up myself.  I made a promise to myself to always bring an alarm clock along for my future travels!",4,2014,07,14
211,Great Hotel,"This hotel is by the Croke Park stadium, if that matters.  We stayed here as part of a vacation package.  We were surprised at how upscale and luxurious this hotel really was.  The staff was very friendly and helpful at every turn.  The room was exceptionally nice.  The bed was comfortable, the bathroom was simply amazing.  There was plenty of room to relax, it was quiet, and we had everything we needed to start our tour or Ireland.  Our package included a full Irish breakfast and that was also exceptional.  It was a buffet breakfast, but included nearly anything I could dream of eating for breakfast.  The hotel is about a 15 minute walk to the main part of Dublin and maybe 45 minute walk to the Guinness Storehouse.",5,2014,07,13
211,An unexpected wow!,"What a comfortable and cool hotel! My husband and 18-year-old son and I shared a room with two big double beds - a spacious room with a big bathroom. Everything is fresh and new feeling, and the room was quiet. The hotel is right across the street from the stadium, but there is nothing else close by. We are good walkers, so had no trouble walking the 20 minutes to get into the part of the city we wanted to visit. My only complaint is that I declined breakfast when we checked in - an hour later my husband and son said I should have said yes to breakfast, so I popped back down to the front desk only to be told that the price I was offered at check-in was no longer available and breakfast would now cost 4 pounds per person more. This is a bit ridiculous. But otherwise I had no complaints - the staff were kind and helpful (other than the breakfast thing), and the hotel was a great price for a very comfortable stay.",4,2014,07,13
211,"Comfortable, convenient stay","The hotel is quite comfortable and located very conveniently on the North side of Dublin, for those just arriving from the airport. It's also a 5 minute walk from a popular bus route with lines into the city for less than 2 Euros. We appreciated being able to park the car and then head downtown on a bus.",4,2014,07,13
211,Fabulous Hotel,"We stayed for 2 nights at the Croke Park Hotel in Dublin and I can only say it was one of the best hotels Spacious and with every convenience, clean and so upmarket for the price we paid Highly recommended",5,2014,07,13
211,Awesome hotel near Dublin,"This hotel was a find. Big, comfortable rooms and bathrooms. The lobby and restaurant are immaculate and the car park was great to use. We were able to get everything we needed in the hotel and it walking distance from Dublin city center. It was also only about 10 minutes from the airport. If you are looking for a hotel with parking and convenience in Dublin for a family or larger group, highly recommend. It is a business hotel, but worked out awesome for families and visiting friends. Agree with reviewers to purchase the breakfast. One it's awesome and two more convenient than anything else in the area.",5,2014,07,12
211,Croke park hotel,"Thoroughly enjoyed our stay, it was so refreshing to stay in a hotel where the staff were more than happy to go above and beyond the call of duty! We will definitely return to this hotel on our next visit to dublin.",5,2014,07,12
211,Great hotel - a little out of the main part of town,"We picked this hotel on the basis of TA recommendations and a good price through Splendia.  It's a little outside town; maybe a 20 min walk to the Temple Bar area, if you're a quick walker.  We tended to get a cab back at night.  Get breakfast included as there isn't anywhere else nearby.  

The hotel itself was great - comfortable rooms and excellent and friendly service at the reception.  The concierge organised us a hire car and the hire car was brought to the hotel (admittedly from just up the road).",5,2014,07,12
211,perfect,"We stayed at this hotel upon returning from holiday and pre Croke park tour the following day. We were able to check in around 2 pm no hassle.
Rooms were spacious, clean and very comfortable albeit the double bed for 2 adults would not be over big. The tv even had sky sports free of charge.
Although we did not have evening dinner at the hotel it looked extremely nice, we did however have breakfast in the morning and was without doubt A1.
After staying at numerous hotels I found the staff at this hotel extremely helpful and sincere.
The hotel had plenty of seating area with a library area, the hotel bar had a nice ambiance with a variety of personnel  relaxing there .
Definitely stay at this hotel again.",5,2014,07,11
211,Amazing Stay!,"This hotel went beyond my expectations. There was nothing bad I could say about it. The only suggestion I would have is to get better wifi throughout the hotel. Our room we had a very weak signal but we were hardly in our room. The staff was friendly, the food was to die for, the room was comfortable and always cleaned daily.",5,2014,07,11
211,"Great hotel, recommended","We stayed for a weekend in June, the hotel was able to accommodate us arriving at 10am and were able to get us in a room straight away. We also chose to upgrade to the executive rooms for an extra 30 euro a night, where we got a slightly better room, and access to an executive lounge, free drink each at the bar and access to tea/coffee etc in the executive lounge all day and night. The service at front desk and in the lounge was fantastic. The rooms were spotlessly clean and very comfortable. The rooms are like a modern high standard business hotel in look and feel. Bar was very good, also with good service. The location was about a 15 minute walk from the centre - and when I say centre I mean to o'connell or Parnell street, so the centre north of the river. If you want to get to temple bar I'd say it's a 25 minute walk from the hotel. I do know Dublins layout having visited before so it might take others a little longer! We walked back to the hotel after nights out and never felt there would be any problem (I've read a couple of comments about wanting to get a taxi back at night due to the area), but each to their own as a 15-20 minute walk at the end of the night might not be everyone's idea of fun anyway! Great hotel,highly recommended.",4,2014,07,10
211,Great Location and atmosphere,"While in Dublin recently we decided to go to a Hurling final that was being held at Croke Park and found this was a great venue to stay at straight across the road from Croke Park. Its location meant it was the hub of the pre game and after match action. The hotel is clearly well experienced in these events and it was easy to get a drink, service was great and the crowd that assembled pre match and after a happy and fun group to be in whether your team won or loss. We dined in the restaurant and found the menu to be well priced with good food on offer. The hotel also has its quieter times if that's what you are looking for a great location to visit other sights of Dublin this is a good place to stay, the ""Get on Get Off"" Tour Bus stops here and Croke Park is not just a sports ground but a historic landmark worth seeing. Slightly more expensive than some on big match days but with no parking problems, great atmosphere and a walk across the street to the ground well worth it.  Brian and Leanne Wodonga Australia",5,2014,07,10
211,Four Star Quality,"Our last two days of our CIE tour was spent at the Croke Park Hotel.  Hotel was very nice.  Rooms were large with two double beds, air conditioning and large bathroom.  Restaurant was good.  The only drawback was that it was a 20 minute walk to the City Center.  Area around hotel was not the best.  Only a few restaurant near the hotel.  The Hop On-Hop Off bus picks up 4 times in the morning but after that you are on your own to the City Center - about a 20 minute walk or cab ride.  Large stadium is right across the street from the hotel - a rugby match was going on when we arrived but the noise level in the hotel was very low.  Free Wi-Fi was not available in the room only in the lobby and restaurant.",5,2014,07,09
211,Dublin Trip,"We had a great ""Groupon"" trip to Ireland with our last part of the trip in Dublin.  Crooke Park Hotel was great.  The staff was very accommodating, they first put us in a smoking room.  I called as soon as we walked in and the came right up and helped us move our luggage to a new non-smoking room.  The bathroom was great with a wonderful tub. Very comfy  bed and bedding. I would recommend this hotel for both family and business trips.",5,2014,07,08
211,Great hotel,"Nicest place I've stayed in Dublin. Staff were really nice and helpful. Food was delicious and so was the wine! Room was fabulous, really spacious and comfortable. Had a great nights sleep here. I'd stay here again in a heartbeat. ",5,2014,07,08

211,Kick Off,On a recent trip to croke park for a match we decided we stay over at the very convenient Croke Park Hotel. A stones throw away. Well it kicked of our weekend as our stay was a very enjoyable despite being very busy. We had a meal in the restaurant prior to kick off. I must say the food was divine the wine was excellent and very good choice of both. The staff were very friendly in all departments from the girls on the rooms upstairs to the reception to the bar and restaurant. Having had the meal it was of to the match were I enjoyed watching my county win and its not were I live. Following that it was back to the hotel bar to celebrate the win with a few nice points before heading to our room for a most comfortable nights sleep. The rooms were superb. A real duel in the city. we are heading North next day and arrived down for breakfast between 8am and 9am Best Time. a very nice selection of fruits/Breads/Hot food/continental. Guys highly recommend. A word of warning book early for best prices because like all hotels when there are big matches/concerts they raise pretty sharply. So next time coming to the city think Croke Park hotel you will be pleasantly surprised.,5,2014,07,07
211,Excellent Hotel,"The decor of the hotel is wonderful, and quality of the rooms is great.  Staff very friendly and helpful.  Quality of the rooms is excellent, and makes for a great nights sleep.

Hotel is about a 10 minute drive from the centre, which means at night time it's very quiet in the surrounding area - to get a great night sleep.

Would definitely stay again, and highly recommend",5,2014,07,07

211,Great Hotel & Comfort,"although as most comments say, it is a brief walk away from the action of the Temple Bar area - a must see. However, unlike other comments, we found nothing ""edy"" about the neighbourhood one walks through to get down to the central area.Take in the Arlington Hotel dinner, traditional music and dance show. Food was great and the show was amazing.
Staff at the Croke Park were very helpful and were able to field every question I dad. The rooms were better than my expectation.",5,2014,07,06
211,Excellent weekend break!,"Just returned from a weekend break to dublin- the Croke Park hotel was perfect! The staff we're so friendly - no one could do enough for us!  The room was large, spacious and modern- we got 2 double beds. It is a 15 min walk to town but on 2 main bus routes. We would both highly recommend the hotel ",5,2014,07,06
211,Friendly & great value,"I states at the hotel on a Monday night during a business trip with colleagues. To be honest we didn't use the facilities much as Dublin centre and all the wonderful Bars awaited. That said the hotel is lovely and comfortable and the full Irish breakfast was a perfect start to the day.  The staff couldn't have
Been more friendly and welcoming and even offered
Us a bottle of water after checking out for a drink on our journey - not a major thing but a nice touch I thought . So had a good nights sleep and a great breakfast for £75 ( booked through travel Republic) so great value but note - I was told by a friendly taxi driver that if there is a big event at Croke Park Stadium ( just across the road) it is likely to be nearer £200 and books up well in advance.  Oh yes - the underground car parking was free too - tight but that's the norm these days.",5,2014,07,05
211,Not so impressed,"My sister had previously stayed here and couldn't recommend it highly enough.  However when we returned with our mum she agreed that it was not how she remembered it. We had asked for a triple room but when we got into the room, it was clear that it was intended as a twin. There were 2 small double beds (queen size?) And only towels, cups etc for 2. I rang reception to check whether there had been a mistake but was informed that it was a triple as the beds were doubles.  (I beg to differ!) 
As we were only there for one night and the hotel was full we decided to leave it, requested a third set of towels and cup and headed out. When we returned at 11, there was no sign of the extra towels or cup!
I shared a bed with my sister and didn't sleep a wink in the slightly oversized single. Added to this we were on the first floor right opposite three lifts so could hear them all night as well as everyone returning to the floor into the wee hours. 
Furthermore our room faced out onto the road so we could also hear all taxis pulling up outside and anyone who happened to slightly raise their voice with the effect that they were in the room.
It seems to be a different story for double rooms or others perhaps away from the lifts, front of the hotel and higher up but sadly that was my first and possibly last experience of the hotel. 
It looked so promising from the outside and had great word of mouth and as it is expensive, we had decided to splurge on somewhere nice to stay. Such a disappointment. ",2,2014,07,05
211,True Irish Hospitality,"Our stay at this hotel was perfect in every way.  At the end of the day, we always felt as if we were returning home.  It is a very quick, safe 12 minute walk to city center which we enjoyed every morning.  In the evening, we were more inclined to take a taxi back to the hotel as we were just too tired from our busy day.  Breakfast was perfect, and the coffee was hot and delicious and arrived almost the instant we sat down.  Our room was very clean, air-conditioning worked like a charm and was not noisy.  The water in the shower was nice and hot and good pressure. The hotel was busy but we did not experience any noise in the hallways. Every member of the hotel team was welcoming, helpful, friendly and caring, a true representation of Irish hospitality.  I hope to return again soon.",5,2014,07,05
211,comfort,"This hotel provided the comfort and security needed in a capitol city.The beauty as far as I found was mainly in the ability of all the staff,whilst respecting your privacy, still being available when needed.",5,2014,07,04
211,Fantastic,"The hotel is very friendly and comfortable. Breakfast was very good. There is no need to worry about being slightly further out from the centre as the Hopon Hopoff bus has a shuttle to and from the hotel, which we didn't realise at first, so spent €10 per trip until we read about it ( maybe something the hotel staff should mention?). I had put on the booking.com website that it was my mothers 70th birthday and they left a birthday card and  2 small bottles of prosecco in a bucket of ice upon arrival in the room, very nice touch.

Many thanks.",4,2014,07,03
211,Unwelcoming staff,"As a part of the CIE tour group, this hotel was not service oriented as all the other hotels on our 15 day tour of Ireland.  One man who was left in charge of our needs was indifferent and herded us like we were a group instead of individuals with a tour group.  I booked another night because CIE uses this hotel, but not assume this in the future.  ",3,2014,07,02
211,Croke Park Dublin,"We recently stayed at Croke Park Hotel for two nights. It was a very pleasant experience. The rooms were clean, staff helpful (loaning power adapters and calling taxis) and the concierge mapped out our sightseeing routes for us. The bus tours stop right outside the hotel, making travel around the city very convenient. We did not eat at the hotel so I cannot comment on the food, but walked a few blocks to Fagan's pub. It was excellent. The only down side I can see to this hotel is the location. Some of the surrounding properties are somewhat rundown. Other than that, it was excellent and a great value. ",5,2014,07,02

Short walk to downtown with highly recommended greenline bus pickup in the morning for daytime sightseeing.,5,2014,06,30
211,Enjoyed our Stay,"This hotel is next to the Croke Park Stadium so noise can be a factor to consider if an event is scheduled. It was very quiet during our two stays, at the beginning and the end of a CIE tour. The price was good and our rooms were very nice, as were the staff. This was the best of all the hotels we stayed in during our tour throughout Ireland. We walked into the city center, checking out pubs along the way for lunches. Its about a 40 minute walk to Grafton Street. The Green Hop-On-Off bus stops right in front of the hotel and is a good option. There is a great museum in the stadium (far side) worth checking out. We had an early departure (4am) so missed the wonderful buffet breakfast on our last day but the very accommodating staff prepared a take-away bag with water, apple, banana, peach and muffin for us.",4,2014,06,30

When we got to our room we looked in the frig and picked up a bottle of wine to check out the brand not realizing we would get charged for removing it from the shelf. We of course put it back and when I called the front desk they immediately took the charge off without question...whew!",5,2014,06,30
211,Excellent hotel experience!,Really enjoyed my stay here. A lot of little things that make a lot of difference. They gave me a hot towel just like on the airplane upon check-in as I had a long day. Free wifi throughout the hotel that was easy to log onto. I ate at the bar and the food was really nice. I just had a very pleasant experience there! Thanks! I'd stay again. I chose this hotel based on Tripadvisor and don't regret it one bit!,5,2014,06,30

Having parked in the free car park we were given warm facecloths at reception during check in. 
Good size bedroom with separate shower and bath. Additional single bed in case I fell out with the wife (I didn't need it).

Ample quality breakfast- wide range.

15 minute walk to the centre - not the most scenic but ok.

Good quality bar food (didn't use restaurant).

Also got 20% discount for Croke Park Skyline walk.

Love this hotel and the very friendly staff.",5,2014,06,28
211,A great hotel,"We stayed here because the rates we considerably cheaper than similarly rated hotels in the heart of the city. The hotel was a great base, only 20 euro from the airport by taxi and about 10 euro to get to the other side of the city (St Stephen's green) but we walked into Grafton street most days. It's only about 20 minutes, some Dubliners told us we'd pass through some 'dodgy' areas but we didn't see any evidence of this and we felt safe (mind you it was in summer with the streets we'll lit until 10:30pm)

The room was quite large and well equipped, we didn't eat at the hotel so can't comment about the restaurant. 

Our room was on the first floor just above the 'pub' part of the hotel, we could hear the band but it wasn't distracting and finished about 11pm",5,2014,06,27
211,Not what we expected,"We booked this hotel based on the rewievs online. We were so let down. The area is really bad and far away from the center. We don""t mind walking but when the neighbourhood is horrible its not funny. Our room smells strange. Regret this hotel :(

We will definitely be staying here again!",5,2014,06,26
211,Great Hotel,"I stayed at the Croke Park Hotel for 1 night while working in East Point Business Park. I have stayed at a lot of hotels in Dublin while working here and I have to say that this hotel is my favourite.

The location is great for East Point, or Croke Park Stadium (it's right next door!) if you are seeing a game or event. You would need to get taxis in and out of the centre of Dublin however if you were to do some city sightseeing.

The hotel is clean, tidy and very well laid out, the staff are friendly and professional too. My room was very large, it was at the front of the hotel and seemed very quiet, I even had a young family staying in the room next door and I couldn't hear them at all. 

I had room service in the evening as it was so late when I returned, which was really good (club sandwich - recommended) and reasonably priced too. The breakfast was tasty and well stocked as well, with the standard Irish cooked breakfast and small continental buffet. 

Very impressed with this place, would definitely stay here again on business or on holiday with the Mrs.",5,2014,06,26
211,Top Hotel - Great Location,"We stayed here for one night on our way back to Germany from Galway. Do not be put off by the neighbourhood, its actually a pretty safe area, and very centrally located. We were on O'Connell Street in little more than 20 minutes, and Grafton Street 10 minutes later.
The hotel itself is a good size, secure underground parking (free) is definitely a bonus, and a pre-booked breakfast of €10 is also decent value.
The room was big, clean, light, and the bathroom was adequate (although the water pressure for the shower was the worst I have ever experienced in my entire life).
All in all good hotel, great value for money, and I would definitely recommend it.",4,2014,06,26
211,"Croke Park Hotel, Dublin, Ireland","This is a terrific hotel, with large rooms and baths and a handsome lobby. The hotel is kept in a spotless manner, and the staff are very helpful.

Ted & Mary McFadden, Jenkintown, PA, USA",5,2014,06,25
211,Great hotel minutes from city center,"We stayed here our final 2 days of our Ireland trip.  It was within walking distance to City Center...free parking is nice...the restaurant has a delicious VEGAN (hard to find many vegan menu items in Ireland) quinoa salad with hummus.  The room was a decent size, clean, free wi-fi worked great, front staff very helpful (especially when I couldn't remember my in-room safe combination).",5,2014,06,24
211,Great Hotel But Not Central For Tourists,"The hotel is lovely. Large modern rooms with deep bathtub and separate glass shower stall. The staff is incredibly helpful, and the hotel even left us prosecco (like champagne) for my birthday!

The breakfast buffet was also quite good. We never tried the bar or restaurant for other meals but they are spacious and looked wonderful also.

It's also easy to get to from the airport. The Air Coach bus drops you at the first stop, Drumcondra. Take your first left then walk about 10 minutes to the traffic light, turn right and the hotel is up the road on the right. 

Overall we loved the hotel!

This is not however the best location for sightseeing in Dublin. It's across from the Croke Park Stadium so it's not in the heart of the area for the sightseeing bus. The Grey Line City Sightseeing bus does stop across the street with the blue line of its busses but the problem is it only runs every half hour AND it stops running early afternoon so you will have to take a taxi back and if you want to go back into City Center for dinner you'll need a cab both ways which runs around 9€ each way.  The green bus line, Dublin Bus Tours, also stops here and it seems to run later but I don't know how late.",5,2014,06,24
211,Lovely hotel with friendly staff!,"We stated here for our 1st wedding anniversary as we visited Dublin for a few days. 

The staff were friendly and helpful, we received complimentary prosecco, an anniversary card and even felt our room had been upgraded compared to what we booked. The hotel was decorated well and our room was nice and spacious. We had breakfast there everyday which was great as it filled us up for most of the day! 

We checked in early and left late but was able to leave our luggage with concierge until we returned/left. 

The hotel is situated opposite Croke Park stadium but is about a 20-25 minute walk from O'Connell street. This was fine but after being on your feet all day we wish we'd stayed a little closer to the centre.

The location of the hotel would put us off from returning as we couldn't be bothered with the walking again. As you end up walking through what feels like an estate we were asked for money by a teenager one evening. When we politely declined and continued walking he began to follow us. It was slightly intimidating even though I was with my husband but I'm sure this was a one off and obviously nothing happened. 

All in all - lovely hotel with friendly staff.",4,2014,06,24
211,Great vibe,"I recently stayed at the hotel where I found the rooms amazing and the beds so comfy. I had drinks at the bar before heading for dinner. I was served at the bar by a very nice girl Leanne. She was so polite and helpful answering any questions myself and my partner had. Food was also fantastic. Cant wait to come back and stay again.
",5,2014,06,24
211,Good for a day or two,"The Croke Park is a good quality business style hotel - little individuality and a formulaic design but a dependable quality and comfort you can reckon on. Room items like the towels, bedding and crockery were above average. Staff were quite willing to give us a room at 9am but none were ready. The location is a good walk from the city centre but quite manageable for the two days we spent exploring the city. Quite OK for a quick city visit. Recommended!",4,2014,06,23
211,"Have stayed before, stayed this time and will return again....Consistency is the key.","This hotel is excellent for families with children. It is a truly great place to stay. I have stayed before but am reviewing again as this place is consistently excellent. I am never dissappointed. What makes it great is the high standard of service that always occurs when we stay.
Hotel rooms are huge for families, spotless, massive bathrooms, loads of toiletries, ample space, yum breakfast, great attitude towards kids, walking distance to everything in Dublin. It is worth joining their loyalty system as this includes bottles of water and hot towels.
I think this has everything a family needs for a weekend away - at a really really reasonable price in Dublin city centre.",5,2014,06,23
211,Nice place to stay,"this was a nice hotel, the staff were very welcoming and helpful, and the rooms were comfy.  The shower was great, fab acoustics...!  We had the breakfast and it was great value, I'd definitely recommend it and stay there again.",5,2014,06,23
211,Top Hotel - Good Location,"We stayed here for one night on our way back to Germany from Galway. Do not be put off by the neighbourhood, its actually a pretty safe area, and very centrally located. We were on O'Connell Street in little more than 20 minutes, and Grafton Street 10 minutes later.
The hotel itself is a good size, secure underground parking (free) is definitely a bonus, and a pre-booked breakfast of €10 is also decent value.
The room was big, clean, light, and the bathroom was adequate (although the water pressure for the shower was the worst I have ever experienced in my entire life).
All in all good hotel, great value for money, and I would definitely recommend it.",4,2014,06,23
211,would return,"Very nice hotel.  We got VERY lost t trying to find the place sine Dublin hardly ever uses street sigms to label the roads. We bought the full breakfast and it was very yummy. We were never offered coffee or and table service so we didn't leave a tip. The rooms were very niceand cozy. Beds were very comfortable.  Rooms have a bathtub which out of 5 places thus far in Ireland,  they were the only ones that had a tub.",5,2014,06,22
211,"Good beds, otherwise a bit boring","The hotel is basically all right, a business hotel between three and four stars. It had very good beds though. 
The location is few blocks from the O'Connell Street (High Street), however two taxi drivers warned of those few blocks as 'not so safe'. However the block where the hotel is, is alright, they said. It is just at the huge Croke Stadium. So those attending that, the location is perfect. Otherwise the hotel area is boring with filthy river behind it, and industrial back yard feeling, thus bad location.
Somehow the hotel overall feels boring too.
Rooms are alright but bland.
Breakfast is only average or a bit below even.
We got upgraded to Executive room with Executive lounge pass. There was water and coffee on offer. Obviously it was an extra bonus, but I wouldn't pay for it.
Minibar wasn't automatically refilled the next day which was an unpleasant surprise late the next evening while looking for some refreshment. While checking out I learnt that it had been my duty to inform the reception of the refill need. Still they had seen automatically what had been used. Strange policy, which I haven't experienced anywhere else. Bad service actually.
While doing check out, the young male receptionist with white spectacles was more interested in listening to some jokes told in the lobby. I was ignored. While passing me finally the bill, he again laughed at another joke, passed me the envelope not looking at me at all, saying nothing to me, turning away from me. I shrugged my shoulders and walked away.",3,2014,06,22
211,Very good hotel,"We travel to Dublin quite often, but this hotel is one of the best ones we have stayed so far. Staff was very helpful, big room & very clean. Food in this hotel is just amazing, whatever you will order I'm pretty sure will be superb. We ate there 3 times within 24 hours.",4,2014,06,22
211,Would very happily stay again!,"I took a gamble and read a few reviews and booked online from Australia to stay here for our first 3 nights in Ireland. Close to the airport and close to the city. We arrived, as a young surfing couple from Australia and found the hotel to be as luxurious as it looked and reviewed to be.
We found the staff here to be incredible, always willing to help and to offer you the best service they could, they would offer you the coat of their back I think. The breakfast was the best we found in any hotel in Ireland with the most options and freshly brewed coffee, not dripolator or plunged!! It would have to be one of the best places we stayed in in Ireland. I would not doubt recommending anyone to stay here. My partner and I walked everywhere, (We don't mind the exercise) to the Guinness storehouse, Trinity College, Temple bar, the Jameson Distillery and many more. 10-15min walk from the city and also Hop and stop tickets from the hotel door step. We walked or caught cabs and were happy enough with either of these!",5,2014,06,21
211,First time in Dublin,"The staff was extremely helpful from suggesting how to see the city by day and night, to recommending excellent neighborhood  restaurant, Wallace. It is located an easy walk to downtown. Hop and Stop ticket available at the desk for 2 day. ",4,2014,06,20
211,Exceptional!,"We arrived VERY late the night of June 18th - technically, it was very early on the 19th (smile). There are 7 of us in our party and we were welcomed by the night manager. He was very friendly and went over all of the details of our stay. In the morning, we went down late for breakfast and thought we may be turned away as it was closing soon. On the contrary, we were seated and had a fantastic meal. The coffee was a bit weak and the next morning, when I asked for a stronger cup, Laura made me a wonderfully strong coffee. Later on, Zuzana, the Team Leader came by to make sure everything was good and asked if we needed anything - she also made me another cup of coffee. Could not have been happier with the quality of food and service at breakfast.

All of us have enjoyed staying here. We have received excellent service from everyone, the breakfast staff is very friendly, the rooms are clean and well sized, the beds are comfortable, and the staff is helpful. A special thanks to Laura and Zuzana in the breakfast room, who went out of their way for us. I would highly recommend this hotel!!",5,2014,06,20
211,Excellent,"My husband and I  booked this hotel  due to location ( being near to my family) we were staying the weekend to attend a family celebration.  The hotel was exceptional  in quality, friendliness, cleanliness, and comfort. I would  have no hesitation in recommending the hotel. Staff exceedingly helpful, welcoming and friendly.",5,2014,06,17
211,Comfortable hotel with friendly service in a good location,We chose to stay at the hotel as it was within easy reach of the ferry port for an early check-in there the following morning. We couldn't have had a warmer welcome or been made to feel more special even though it was a flying visit.,5,2014,06,17
211,Basic business hotel,"We stayed at the Croke Park for our first night in Ireland. We were very jet-lagged and exhausted. The staff was very friendly and tried to be helpful, but they seemed quite understaffed, as we had to wait quite a while both at the check in desk and for service in the bar. The room was nice and fairly spacious; everything was clean and as expected. Our only issue was the heating, which took so long to adjust that we concluded it was not working at all - only to discover ourselves wildly overheated at about 3am after it apparently kicked in. We did ask at the desk about the heat (after we'd been in the room for about 2 hours) but their only advice was to wait. Otherwise the hotel was quite serviceable, if boring. It's on the edge of town not near much of anything but the stadium. The decor and amenities were unremarkable and the menu options at both dinner and breakfast were adequate but uninteresting.",3,2014,06,17
211,Wonderful Hotel for a trip to Dublin,"We stayed in this hotel over the weekend we booked directly with the Hotel and decided on the discover Dublin rate of 129euro this included 2 day pass on the hop on hop off bus, 3pm check out full Irish breakfast a complimentary drink each and free parking. We upgraded to the fourth floor, on this floor you have access to a kitchen/ sitting area with newspapers coffee tea, biscuits juice etc. There is an ice making machine on this floor also.
 If you decide on the room only rate you can upgrade when you arrive to the hotel.You can enjoy a contintental brekfast here and help yourself, although we did not have the breakfast here we could see it was very good and we were impressed with it.
We enjoyed breakfast downstairs, it is a self service fare with plenty of everything. Lovely waiting staff with happy friendly faces, nothing is too much trouble.
Overall the Hotel is a great location to see Dublin, the green hop on hop off bus picks you up outside the door.
A taxi from Grafton St area cost us 12 euro.
Would I return, definately yes, I would highly recommend this hotel to family & friends. Keep up the good work and smiley faces.",5,2014,06,16
211,Cant Fault it at all,"Easily the best hotel I have ever stayed at. Clean, comfortable, good food, excellent staff, and only a ten minute walk from city centre. Brilliant. Booked it through Expedia and the rates were not expensive either. Wouldnt even consider staying anywhere else now when I visit Dublin.
      ",5,2014,06,15
211,Great Business Class Hotel for first nights in Dublin,"We really enjoyed Croak Park. The rooms are great even by American standards. The breakfast was excellent and cheaper if you bought it at check-in. Efficient staff and concierge. We particularly liked it's comfort while we got over jetlag.

It is located on the north side of the River. EASY BUS ride for €2.60 from the airport on bus 16. Get off at Quinn's pub, stop 47. The hotel is two blocks east and 2 short blocks south at the southwestern corner of the Croak Park stadium.

5 block walk to the start of the heart of town, or back to the bus to center.
Quiet neighborhood unless there is a match on.",4,2014,06,14
211,Exceptional,"This hotel is faultless. I took my fiancé here for his birthday, on arrival at 10pm we were greeted by a young man at the desk who was very helpful and answered any questions we had. The only half bad comment is the area surrounding the hotel isn't that great but a ten minute walk and you're in the centre of Dublin, O'Connell street. ",5,2014,06,14
211,After a long overnight flight,"My daughter and I had a very long overnight flight coming in from Arizona with a long layover in Chicago and this was our first stop in Ireland. We arrived at 7AM and they were as accommodating as they could at this hour as they could be. The room was comfortable, clean and very nice. This room was part of a package deal with Aer Lingus and didn't expect anything so nice. The breakfast buffet was fantastic and was included with the room.",5,2014,06,14
211,Great place in Dublin,"We were 'assigned' this hotel with a package deal. Never expected such quality. It is a little out of the way, but bus service was excellent. Taxis were available and we even walked to it once. We were very pleased with the overall quality of the hotel, staff and dining facilities.",5,2014,06,13
211,Very impressed,"I stayed for one night on business in June 2014. First impressions were great, the decor of the hotel is exceptional and the staff are very friendly and welcoming.

The room is spacious and the fresh fruit is a really nice touch. The bedding was very comfortable.

Breakfast was good, my only suggestion would be that it starts at 6am instead of 6:30am.

I will stay again the next time I'm in Ireland.",5,2014,06,12
211,Medium-Good business hotel,"If you are ok to stay outside the immediate city centre than this is a good hotel.
I was fortunate to stay at an executive room. When I entered the room there was fresh fruit and a hand-written card welcoming me. personally. Havent seen that for a long time.
The room has everything you need for a business trip. It is clean, spacious enough and a bathroom with show and bathtub.
We had dinner in the restaurant and we were amazed by the quality. Also the staff was very friendly in the restaurant.
Breakfast is normal. I would have liked real fresh juices and a larger variety of bread. Then again that might be just my thing. 
All in all a good choice when you stay in Dublin.",4,2014,06,12
211,Great Hotel,"A great hotel to stay in, staff are very friendly, hotel has a great atmosphere, plenty of parking spaces. Great buffet breakfast, nice walk into the city.  Looking forward to my next stay in the Croke Park
      
      ",5,2014,06,12
211,Fantastic overnighter,"My family and I ,all adults stayed at the hotel overnight for a concert in Dublin. The experience was fantastic and the staff went out of their way to help with everything we asked for. The hotel is a 10 minute stroll from the centre of town so is ideally situated. I will definitely stay here again if I am in Dublin.",5,2014,06,12
211,No hassle before my exam,"The night before I had an exam, I stayed in the Croke Park hotel. 
The staff were lovely, and helpful.  The breakfast was good, and varied.  The room was not big, but it was well equipped, and very comfortable.",5,2014,06,12
211,excellent place to stay in Dublin,"Spent 2 nights here and would recommend to all, our room was on executive floor with lounge providing tea,coffee, papers. Breakfast buffet above average and had bar food one evening, free parking a perk in Dublin plus close to bus routes if you don't fancy the 20 min walk into town. Staff very friendly and attentive, will definitely be back!

",4,2014,06,10
211,Honeymoon Heaven,"We booked this hotel for our honeymoon.  While the location isn't in the center of the city, do not let that deter you from booking it.  It's an amazing hotel with an incredibly friendly staff and two nice restaurants’.  They had balloons and champagne in our room waiting for us for our honeymoon.  We even got a card wishing us a happy marriage from them.  Incredible facility.  If we ever end up in Ireland again, I would definitely book a room here.",5,2014,06,10
211,Ideal for event in Croke Park,"This hotel is ideal for attending event or game in Croke Park.  We were attending event in the players lounge and just had to cross the road!
The hotel room is lovely great size and large bathroom only problem is our room was beside the lift so we heard the noise from it all morning so when checking in let them know this.
Very friendly check in staff and car park was great free at weekend. ",5,2014,06,09
211,Nice/pleasant,"There was no inhouse beauty therapist or hairdresser which would have been nice as I had some evening time to spare.  There is no swimming pool either. However, the beds are top class and the food is also excellent. There are no shortcuts... what they do .. they do V well.. Thanks.
      ",4,2014,06,09
211,Great Value,"Just returned from a fantastic vacation in Ireland with my wife, daughter and future son-in-law.  Our trip was made extra special with a stay at The Croke Park Hotel. The hotel overall and our room was exceptionally clean, the breakfast was terrific and quite plentiful and the location worked for us.  The staff was extremely friendly, very professional and so attentive to our needs.  Kathleen at the front desk saw to it that at least one room would be made available to us as early as possible (we arrived at the hotel at 7am) so that we could freshen up after our transatlantic flight which arrived in Dublin at 5am.  The Hop On / Off bus stops right in front of the hotel which is very convenient if you desire to use it and take in all the sights / major attractions around town without using your car or taxis. 
If you're looking for a hotel that's in the center of the action (aside from Croke Park which is directly across the street) and allows you to easily walk to Temple Bar, Grafton Street, etc this may not work for you.  However, if you want a really nice, modern, clean hotel that offers great value with an outstanding staff than The Croke Park Hotel will absolutely suit your needs.",5,2014,06,09
211,Probably good for business purposes,"This hotel is clearly a business- and sports-event-hotel, and it is without a doubt perfect for these two purposes (although both printers in the PC-area were out of ink).
For tourist purposes it is nothing special. Cold atmosphere – clearly efficiency matters most. We only chose this hotel because it is easy to get to the harbor from the hotel and we had an early ferry to catch the next morning. 
Rooms are large, clean and fine for sleeping. View is blocked by the colossal stadium across the road.",3,2014,06,09
211,Best Beds in Dublin (maybe all of Ireland!) and Great Service too!,"We stayed at the Croke Park Hotel for 2 nights at the beginning of our trip to Ireland and then again for the last night before flying home.  If a comfortable bed is of great importance to you, this is your hotel!  The staff is helpful, friendly and respectful, the rooms are comfortable in general with soft but supportive mattresses. A very nice shower too!  Food in the bar was very good, prices were decent and the atmosphere was comfortable. Service was slow in general but that is the only real criticism. Management showed genuine concern about a mistake that was made in our booking and did their very best to make it up to us. We opted for the ""Best of Dublin"" package which included full breakfast, tickets to the Hop On Hop Off Bus and a free drink in the bar. It was worth it. The hotel also offers free parking. The location has it's ups and downs.  It is a good distance from City Center so if you are planning to walk, it's a long hike (especially if you are planning to then spend the day walking around the city).  The Hop On- Hop Off Bus (the GREEN ONE!) will pick you up at the hotel if you don't want to walk and it's a good deal. On the plus side- the location puts you 15 minutes or so from the airport for an easy commute. Due to being outside City Center, you don't have the traffic coming and going that you do when staying downtown and it's quieter.  We whole-heartedly recommend this hotel- i wouldn't even consider staying somewhere else when in Dublin!",5,2014,06,08
211,Lovely stay,"Stayed in April with my partner. Must say the staff really make this hotel, they are so friendly and helpful. I recommend eating in the bar rather than the restaurant as it is more relaxed and we found the bar menu is tastier for less expense. The rooms are immaculate and the hotel is within walking distance to Dublin city centre. We will definitely be staying here again",5,2014,06,07
211,Ideal for One Direction Concert,"We luckily secured a room at this hotel for the One Direction concert on the Friday night. Our well appointed room faced the Croke Park Stadium. The hotel coped very well with the extra activity that this event generated. Staff remained pleasant and helpful. A nice touch on the Saturday morning was complimentary glasses of juice, hot chocolate, tea or coffee on offer to those queued for breakfast, not that one had to queue for too long. There were plenty of staff working at all times. The stay at this hotel contributed to this trip being unique and memorable. Well done Croke Park Hotel!",5,2014,06,05
211,Wouldn't stay anywhere else in Dublin!,"Excellent hotel, this was our second stay here, this time for our honeymoon! The rooms are comfortable and spacious, the breakfasts are outstanding, the hotel is within walking distance of Dublin centre, and the service is fantastic. We will no doubt be back again!",5,2014,06,05
211,"A 4/5 European standards – a 3.5/5 by N. American for rooms, but great locale and hotel staff","The pros:
1.	The hotel is physically located close to the downtown and is very walkable.  About 20 minutes away.
2.	The hotel is attractive inside and the rooms, although simple with few frills, are above average for a European hotel
3.	The workout room is excellent.  There is a wide array of equipment, and ample floor space if you wanted to do other exercises, core, etc.  Lots of machines.  Fresh fruit after your workout
4.	The business centre in the lobby allows you to print
5.	Free high speed wifi through the hotel
6.	Good security.  You need to use your hotel card to access the elevators or go into workout areas
7.	The bar/bistro serve excellent food.
8. The hotel front staff and concierge are amazing.  They elevated the experience incredibly.

The cons:
1.	The laundry chute happened to be close to our room.  Instead of depositing dirty linens as they went along, they piled up about 50 bags of dirty laundry in the hallway leading to our room, and we had to navigate through the maze.  This was gross.  Period.
2.	The scenic view outside our window was a dumpster and an empty lot with broken down buildings.  It is not the nicest area of town, but OK.  It is across from Croke Park stadium, which is a little unusual, but we weren't bothered by games",4,2014,06,05
211,"Great stay, good location...","We stayed at the Croke Park for a couple days in early June '14.  Our room is spotlessly clean and well appointed, in a typical caliber of a Marriott.  The staff is very attentive.  Buffet breakfast is excellent and well served.  Underground parking is free.  We elected not to drive while heading downtown Dublin, and use Bus #16 instead.  Overall, our stay is enjoyable.  I highly recommend the Croke Park Hotel.",5,2014,06,04
211,wonderful,"stayed here on our tour round Ireland it was very good,  the staff very helhful, we had a lovely room, the food was good we met friends and had a great time. we all used the dart train into Dublin it was very fast . Dublin was great lots to do in this place, hope to return.",5,2014,06,04
211,"Great Hotel, Exceptional Staff ",We started our Irish adventure in Dublin and this hotel staff showed us just how delightful Ireland can be!  The room was big and the beds comfortable!  The food in the cafe was exceptional!  The continental breakfast was huge and the staff accommodating.  We got maps and excellent directions for a walking your of Dublin!  We couldn't wait to go back at the end of our trip!  ,5,2014,06,04
211,Excellent in all ways,The staff was very welcoming and helpful.  Our rooms were in perfect condition and very comfortable.  We loved that there were many buses that stopped right in front of the hotel.  We felt like we were in a safe location and treated exceptionally well. ,5,2014,06,04
211,Memorable Stay,"We appreciated that our room was ready and available to us at 10AM (Canadian time 3AM) so we were able to get some rest, before starting our Irish adventure. Then we met the Concierge in the Lobby who told us about the 'Hop on, Hop off' bus tours and the convenience off a shuttle right at the door of the hotel. So, right away we had a City Tour and the following day we enjoyed seeing the different points of interest.
Thank you for making our time in Dublin so memorable!",5,2014,06,03
211,"Excellent, just outside the city","We visited for a relaxing weekend and that is exactly what we got. A number 16 bus takes you from the airport to within 100m of the hotel (get off at Drumcondra station) with a journey time of about 20 minutes. We did not eat all the time in the hotel but the breakfasts were excellent and the evening meal we had was just as good. Staff are exceedingly friendly and very attentive. We don't like city centre hotels and the location was excellent as it was on a bus route, close to a railway station and within walking distance of the centre. The room and bed were comfortable and there was little noise during the night. Would stay again",4,2014,06,03
211,Fantastic! ,"Went for a weekend stay in Dublin, to see sights and for the night life! Short walking distance to the centre. Lovely room, public areas, facilities, bar and restaurant and staff! Just avoid if the stadium has any events on and your not attending as heard it can get crazy in and around that area. ",5,2014,06,03
211,Quality hotel,"I stayed here whilst on business in Dublin. I was very impressed with the hotel. The reception staff were very attentive and nothing was too much trouble. The bar area is very nice. Rooms are very nice, spacious and comfortable. Breakfast was good and plenty of choice. I would say that if people are looking to be near Temple bar area, this hotel is quite far away. There are buses that run frequently. A taxi should cost no more than €20. Overall a good hotel with excellent service.",4,2014,06,02
211,Great place to be after some bad luck.,"Backstory: We were in a very poor decision where we had booked hotel that was like 15 km away from city center. This was a very poor decison because we wanted to go to the Ani-con which was placed in the Croke Park. anyways we drove to Croke Park Hotel by taxi and asked them if they had anything available we were so lucky and fortunate and was able to stay there all the nights. we had a great time explaining our situation and we had a wonderful ani-con considering our poor decisions.

We had a absolutely wonderful time staying at this place mostly thanks to always caring staff members that was really happy to help and do something that feels right.

Our situation started out as a terrible experience in dublin to a really comforting and inviting one thanks to the staff and over all thanks to the nice clean room and big comfortable beds.

The location is located at just about 2 kilometers walk from city center.  Food both dinner and breakfast was very enjoyable. We had a absolutely great time. and it was all because of being able to stay at this hotel.

If we go again we know where to book our room and so do you. ;)",5,2014,06,02
211,Great value,"Croke Park was a clean, well appointed place to stay. I was a little concerned that the hotel would be in a not so good location but I walked into the city centre by myself a few times and never had a problem. The hop on/ hop off bus did have an occasional pick up from outside the hotel, so if you didn't want to walk this was another opportunity to get into the centre.
The room was clean and a good size, the only problem was the shower door was unstable. We stayed in a club room so had access to the club lounge which was a handy place to relax or meet up with the other couple staying with us. 
The bar/restaurant area was good,  and the food and cocktail choice well worth the visit. I would certainly recommend to visitors who didn't mind not staying in the thick of things.",4,2014,06,02
211,Great place to stay,"Great rooms. Beds are very comfortable. Pillows great.
Breakfast has very good selection. Service staff friendly and efficient.
Bathrooms are very bright. Walk in shower with tub for bathing.
Blue hop on hop off bus picks up and drops off right at hotel doors. Great way to view
The city.
No restaurants close by to eat but food in hotel is very good.
A great hotel to stay at.",5,2014,05,30
211,The Right Direction,"Stayed in the Croke Park Hotel recently for the One Direction concerts, although the hotel was very busy, the staff were very helpful and attentive. The room was quite good and the facilities were as you would expect. The breakfast next morning was excellent and the check out was relaxed and informal. Would recommend this hotel unreservedly.",4,2014,05,29
211,Nice hotel bad location!,hotel is nice rooms are clean end modern. It was recommended by our travel agent who we now realize has NO clue about Dublin. The hotel is way too far from downtown and activities. There is not a bus that gets you close to hotel and you have to walk 5 blocks in iffy area dodging dog poo on sidewalks. This would be a good place to stay if it was a mile closer to downtown Dublin.,3,2014,05,29
211,Perfect,"The room was huge, same with the bath - you have bathtub and also shower.
Is located near Croke Park Stadium, so it a little bit far from the city center. 
On the other hand you have direct access to the airport by bus.",5,2014,05,28
211,First class,"We stayed here on Saturday 24th May for 1Direction concert in croke park the staff were very helpfull and friendly.without doubt the place to stay if going to anything in croke park,you have to get down a bit early because off road closures,the only thing I would complain about is the price but then again all hotels in Dublin do the same when there is a big event on.",5,2014,05,28
211,Fantastic - service/ food and,"Stayed in hotel 17 & 18th May 2014; visiting from Australia: the service was fantastic best service and facilities we experienced in whole UK ;  all staff very obliging, excellent check in process  - bags delivered to room in minutes, nothing was any trouble. I had a cold/ sore throat and they even made me a hot lemon and honey drink free of charge which helped me sleep thru the night
location was great  - hop on hop off  shuttle  bus at front door was very convenient.
We enjoyed a very yummy dinner at night and the breakfasts were delicious.
Definitely will book again in 2015 when we return. Would highly recommend this hotel.",5,2014,05,28
211,Great Hotel for Croke Park and City,"This is a lovely Hotel,the staff were friendly and helpful. Its location is in close proximity to the city which is 15 mins walking distance. The rooms are very comfortable as are the beds. We all really enjoyed the stay.",5,2014,05,28
211,Fabulous from start to finish!,"What a fabulous hotel! Stayed here recently after the 1D concert and everything from a-z was first class. Service, staff, rooms, food were fantastic and despite there being  80000 people in the area we were made feel as special as if we were the only guests! I have to praise the training that each staff member so  obviously received as they were so friendly and welcoming  and so very capable of doing their job so very well. Will definitely return!",5,2014,05,27
211,Would definitely recommend!!,"Stayed Sunday 25th May with my daughter and granddaughter for the One Direction concert.  Arrived before 12pm which is checkout time. The car park was manned to make sure non residents didn't park there which made for a great start to our stay.  Our room was ready by 1.30 and much to the delight of my granddaughter who wanted to unpack and 'get ready ' for her big night out!  The room was spotless, very comfortable and also very quiet when we returned to settle down for the night. A great nights sleep!!  
We ate in the bar and the food was piping hot and delicious. The service was excellent, very friendly staff throughout the hotel.  
Considering there were concerts on 3 consecutive nights the hotel was very busy yet every aspect of our stay ran smoothly. I also was impressed by the communication from the hotel before the weekend advising of road closures etc to make our journey easier. 

Well done Croke Park Hotel. Your staff are great ambassadors for your establishment",5,2014,05,27
211,Croke Park Hotel,I stayed here on 25/05/2014 with my 13 year old daughter. I was taking her to the one direction concert in Croke Park which is across the road from the hotel. We had a fantastic stay in the hotel which started with an unasked for upgrade to a deluxe suite with use of the executive lounge and free complimentary continental breakfast. I had not booked breakfast as being with a picky 13 year old it would not have been worth it paying for it. The continental breakfast was more than enough for us and there was plenty to choose from. The hotel bar and restaurant were very busy before the concert as was to be expected so it was much more relaxing in the executive lounge. On checking out we received bottles of water from reception a nice thought for our onward journey. A very pleasant stay in this hotel and would recommend if attending anything in Croke Park.,5,2014,05,27
211,Disabled guest friendly,"I booked the Croke Park Hotel due to its proximity to Croke Park. I initially felt at £299 for a room for three of us that it was very overpriced. 
Travelling with a powered wheelchair user can be very stressful when trying to move about a city - things like a lack of dropped kerbs and taxi's with no ramps and insufficient head room have left us stranded for considerable periods of time in other cities and I didn't want to encounter the same in Dublin ...so we booked the Croke Park inspite of the cost. I was soooo glad we did.

Car parking space was kindly reserved (although the spaces need to be widened to proper wheelchair parking space size), our room was excellent but most of all the staff were so friendly and helpful.

There was a minor oversight in the restaurant to do with our table booking but the Manager instantly rectified and acknowledged inconvenience when the bill was presented - not necessary but very welcome and showed real concern for our experience.

The disabled WC was locked and there was an issue getting it open so the Manager instantly placed a member of staff on duty at he WC door ....which Im sure they could ill afford as they were so busy - again great empathy for the situation and much' much appreciated.

It is a long time since I have been in a hotel which was really friendly and every member of staff showed genuine interest and care in their job. There attention to detail was also great. They had sweet kiosks set up so the kids could easily get snacks, fast food available constantly for those who couldn't get into the restaurant....even late in the evening, returning from the concert. 

Overall great attention to detail and other hotels should take note - (especially the Premier Inn at the Odyssey Belfast. Their restaurant was fully booked when we stayed and they were 'too busy to offer room service' )

Nice touch to be given water on check out for our long journey home.
Well done Croke Park, keep up the great work.

Both Ian & Seán quickly came to our rescue with gel packs etc.   She is perfect since thank goodness. I really appreciate everything you did today to help both my daughter and the rest of our family.  Thanks so much!,5,2014,05,26
211,Excellent hotel and service ,"Stayed on 25th may for the one direction concert. Nothing but praise for the hotel and staff especially given the sheer volume of people passing through it's doors over the weekend. Food was excellent in restaurant! Definitely recommend. Well done to the Croke park hotel. Excellent organisation before the event, great service, great rooms and pleasantly surprised at how quiet the rooms were. Very happy customer :-) ",5,2014,05,26

211,Outstanding performance under serious pressure. ,"We stayed in The Croke Park hotel 24/05/2014 as we were attending the 1D concert in the stadium across the road. For those who may not be aware the hotel had 240000 concert goers on its doorstep over 3 nights yet the staff across the board were professional, courteous and efficient. Even though rooms were being turned over in super quick time our room was spotless, no remnants of any previous guests were found, which in other places can be found lurking in the corners of bathrooms or in the showers. Despite the hotel being fully booked and the numbers outside the room was a quiet oasis before we ventured with our little girl into the throng of screaming kids. On our return after getting a good Irish soaking stations were set up selling hot chocolate etc much to juniors delight. We headed to the room ordered room service which arrived promptly despite the volume of people and it was excellent, especially the Guinness :-) Breakfast was manic yet the queue was dealt with swiftly with plenty on the buffet to set us up for the journey home. Overall a brilliant job was done by the hotel team under the circumstances.",5,2014,05,25
211,QUALITY!,"Wonderful and peaceful stay at this hotel. Helpful informative staff, great food and dining facilities, especially for a coeliac. The rooms were clean and comfortable. I am very happy with my stay at this hotel, and will be back.  ",5,2014,05,25
211,Excellent,"Fantastic hotel and the staff are a credit to this hotel , we stayed here after the one direction concert so payed a premium on the room rate but was well worth it and even got an upgrade to a deluxe room which came with a little bit extra as in the executive lounge and this is open 24 hours in which you can get free tea,coffee and juice for the children in a relaxing comfortable room that also has a large flat screen TV and comfortable couches which just makes the stay even more enjoyable. I will definately come back to this hotel again ",5,2014,05,24
211,"Great stay, loved it.","We booked Croke Park on a recommendation from a friend.  It was about 20 euros in a taxi from the airport, right opposite Croke Park stadium.  We didn't check in until about 11pm but the front desk lady was very friendly and helpful giving us some tips for our stay.  Our room was lovely, really big and big bathroom, massive bad and pillows I wanted to sneak home in my suitcase!  We did only use the htel as a base so didn't spend a lot of time there at all, literally just sleeping but I couldn't fault it.  On the day we checked out (12pm check out - bonus!) we left our cases there for the day and then called us a taxi at 6pm to get us back to the airport.  It is a bit of a trek in and out of the main centre if you're not one for walking but there are a couple of hop on hop off buses that come past really close by.  It was a great stay for my husbands birthday and we had a great time.",5,2014,05,21
211,Excellent hotel in dublin,"I spent 2 nights in the Croke Park Hotel whilst attending a conference at Dublin Castle. The hotel was most comfortable with a very good breakfast to set me up for the day. The central location allowed me to walk to Dublin Castle in 15 minutes leaving my car in the very safe car park. Overall, a very good experience.",5,2014,05,21
211,Very nice,"We had a great stay at the end of a nine night Ireland vacation. The hotel was the nicest we stayed in during our trip, bed was very comfortable,  and it was the most modern. Only downside was breakfast was just average,  much more quantity over quality. All in all though a very nice hotel. ",4,2014,05,21
211,Great customer service and hotel convenient for access to Dublin City,Situated about 20 mins walk from city centre we were able to use shuttle and hop on hop off bus for 2 days. Comfortable clean rooms and excellent customer service. Definitely recommend if you do not mind being away from centre of Dublin. Access is easy and taxis available especially for evenings out in the city.,5,2014,05,20
211,Great choice of hotel,"I discovered this hotel thanks to trip advisor and have to agree with the many others who posted positive comments. There's wasn't one negative thing to say about our stay. On our visit Ireland we stayed three nights on two separate occasions. The room was spotless, as was the bedding. Bed very comfortable. Room a decent size. Breakfast was delicious. On site parking a bonus and we were very happy to be able to access wifi! OK it isn't in the Main Street but was only a 10 minute walk there. I had read some posts which said it took 20 minutes but it didn't for us. Would definitely stay there again.",5,2014,05,20
211,Manager needs to train staff in hospitality,"Arrived at this hotel as part of a bus tour. As we entered the building, we went to front desk, a staff member came out of the office with our keycards. He did not say a word to us just handed our cards and did not even point to the elevators, stairs, restaurant for our breakfast. He did not tell us that we need to scan our cards inside the elevator to get to our floors. 
We walked aimlessly looking for the elevators and once inside spent a few seconds trying to figure out how to make it go up. 
We were a party of two and got just one keycard. Had to go to front desk to obtain a second one and no apologies given. 
From the outside, the hotel looks like is going to fall apart but once in, it is very nice. Modern accommodations,  no problems with the bedroom, bathroom or breakfast buffet. Restaurant was nice and clean with attentive staff.  
Very close to airport, no traffic even though it was Monday morning.",3,2014,05,19
211,Great Hotel!!,"Stayed here on Sat 17 May. Without doubt one of the best and  most relaxing overnight stays we've experienced. Stayed in Executive Room and had use of great lounge!! Will be back and have no hesitation in fully recommending this hotel. A credit to all staff!!
",5,2014,05,18
211,Excellent hotel just minutes walk from Dublin City Centre,I had the pleasure of staying here on business recently and was most impressed.  The customer service provided is definitely 5 stars from the reception staff to bar/restaurant.  The room I had was spacious with a massive bathroom and toiletries provided.  Both evening meal and breakfast was outstanding.  This is a definite return hotel for me not only on business but also when visiting the city on holiday.,5,2014,05,18
211,We were truly impressed,"Great hotel, they do try harder to impress. There was aminor issue with room card key (not unusaul in any hotel) but this was dealt speedily and with tact by the manager. We were very impressed at their can do attitude. A 5* service for reasonable prices. Well done all.",5,2014,05,17
211,hidden treasure,"oh wow what a great hotel, rooms, staff, food 10/10, location not great but wow when you go inside you could be anywhere, loved it will be back,the staff excellent. if in Dublin you should stay here well worth it, could not find any faults,the have a guest lounge  on the top floor with yummy cookies, coffee, teas, juice, fruits, papers, yummy",5,2014,05,17
211,A Memorable Stay Made Perfect,"I am on an escorted tour to Ireland and was booked at The Croke Park Hotel for the first few nights. We arrived at 6:00 AM and were greeted by Caroline who was the Manager on Duty. She did her best to secure us a room then and there! The hotel itself is a tastefully decorated property and serves airline crews as well as regular tourists and tour groups. It's breakfast buffet is outstanding. The rooms are clean, well furnished and maintained. Caroline was helpful throughout our stay and you got the impression that she wanted us to remember The Croke Park and The Doyle Collection. The hotel exceeded our expectations in each and every respect. Hopefully, we will return to Dublin because it is a place steeped in history but Our experience at The Croke Park made it even more memorable!",5,2014,05,16
211,Excellent hotel,"This is the second time that we have stayed at the Croke Park Hotel in the last two months.  On both visits we found the hotel to be  faultless.  The Room, the food, the atmosphere and the staff all perfect",5,2014,05,16
211,Good value for money,"I stay there for one night. Service was good and location is great. Near the airport and close to the the city center. The hotel is nice and the room are of good size. I have to point out the bed quality; brilliant! Once of the best bed I stay. I really appreciate the executive suite. Price wise, excellent value for money. All in all good place for business travelers.",3,2014,05,16
211,Amazing Value,"We had a wonderful stay at this hotel and got an amazing deal on Expedia secret hotels for Easter weekend. I would say we saved about 75% of cost. Rooms are spacious and modern, with lovely bathroom and most comfortable bed ever slept in.  All well equipped with everything you need.  Staff are all friendly and very accommodating.  Did not eat at the hotel as found it fairly expensive, especially breakfast, and too many great restaurants to eat at in the City but did hear that the food is very good.  Location is quite far out of town but walkable in about 15 mins.  Perfect location for stadium events directly opposite.  Not in a great part of town so would get a taxi back late at night.",4,2014,05,13
211,Good location for the airport,"This hotel is in a good location for the airport or football matches, otherwise, the area is not that great.  We were only in Dublin for one night and had an early flight out so it worked pretty well for us.  The hotel was great!  The service was outstanding.  The front desk clerks were very friendly and helpful.  The room was spacious, clean and very comfortable.  The hotel was also quiet.  Both check in and check out were easy, quick and painless.  And we even got complimentary water bottles to go at check out.  A very nice touch!",4,2014,05,13
211,g eakins,a lovely hotel the staff are lovely rooms are nice good television nice bar and excellent food it was my wives birthday and when we came back from shopping there was champagne in our room great gesture ,5,2014,05,12
211,Almost Perfect,"Fabulous hotel - friendly and accommodating staff, clean rooms and common areas, delicious breakfast. The location is a bit out of the way unless you are planning to attend a sporting event, which we were not.  But, that did not matter - we walked to town and enjoyed every moment of our stay at the Croke Park.",5,2014,05,12
211,Perfect in every way :),"Booked at the last minute as we had an event to attend in Drumcondra on Sunday 4th May, and were only informed on Friday 3rd.
Check-in is 2.00pm but we arrived at 12noon expecting to be told we couldn't check-in until later.  Were informed that our room was ready and we could leave our bags up etc.  We were offered assistance with bags etc. but as we were only staying 1 night, we could easily manage our overnight bag each.
We were informed of all facilities available and couldn't have been treated better.
We left and went to our event, returning to the hotel at about 7pm -7.30, and opted to have our evening meal in the Sideline Bar.  We each had the fish 'n' chips, which were divine...the tartare sauce was the nicest ever.. Breakfast was also excellent.
BTW, when we opened our room curtains, we were faced with the front door of Croke Park!  Amazing! Just up above you could see the Hogan Stand!  Excellent location for GAA matches or concerts...if it's a concert ur attending, you don't even need a ticket..am sure you'd be able to hear the artist from your room window.  It really is that close.

Anyway, have no hesitations in recommending, and when next in Dublin, will definitely stay here.  Oops, almost forgot, great music system in room!
:)",5,2014,05,12
211,"Nice hotel, great location for sports fans","We stayed 2 nights at this hotel but wished we had booked it for longer. Very clean and quiet, comfortable bed, helpful staff. Right beside the Croke Park Stadium...not in central Dublin but within walking distance of many of Dublin's tourist spots. Would definitely recommend this hotel.",4,2014,05,12
211,Pleasant Stay,Stayed following a conference at Croke Park itself and this Hotel could not be closer.  Warm welcome and upgraded to an Executive room giving a bit more space.  Rooms were modern and clean with everything working that I needed.  Had access to an Executive lounge offering free tea/coffee and fruit.  Bar downstairs created a good atmosphere with plenty of staff on hand to serve.  Nothing to set this Hotel above the norm but a very nice place to stay and would recommend,4,2014,05,12
211,Nite out in Dublin,"I booked hotel for a night away with a friend for her birthday and wanted to do the Dublin thing ,this hotel was just excellent from booking to checking out .

211,"Fantastic hotel, wonderful staff","We stayed in a superior room with 2 double beds as I was travelling with my mother and baby.  The room was large, nicely presented and the bathroom huge with a bath and shower cubicle. All staff we met were unbelievably friendly.  Only downside was the walk to centre of town not so nice but we found the hotel food really good and reasonably priced for the quality.  A lovely stay.   ",5,2014,05,11
211,Excellent!,"Great hotel! Friendly staff, checked us in early. Good food, comfy bed, and the hop on, hop off bus comes right outside the hotel, although walking to the more touristy part of Dublin only took 15 minutes. Very nice rooms, great showers! Would stay again.",5,2014,05,11
211,Just perfect,I rarely bother with reviews but felt I had to highlight this excellent hotel. Myself and my husband stayed here last night while taking in a play and a concert in the city we arrived back to the hotel at 12 at night at which point I realised the duvet and pillow were feather which I am allergic to.i rang the reception to see on the off chance if they would even be able to send up a sheet that I could use but they insisted on replacing the entire bedding despite it being 12 o'clock at night and despite it being my own fault for not mentioning it or checking earlier. I was very impressed by this.roOm was lovely bed very comfortable and the breakfast is the nicest hotel breakfast I've ever had. Top marks all round,5,2014,05,11
211,Wonderful staff,"We recently stayed for two nights at the Croke Park Hotel. I injured my back the night before we got there, and was in quite a lot of pain. From the minute we came in the door, everyone on the staff went out of their way to do everything they could to help. Provided ice packs for us, sent up breakfast for me, took care of our bags, and helped with a cab to get me to a care clinic. I really felt cared for by everyone there. To the GM, please make sure to thank your staff for me. The hotel was comfortable, and food at the bar was fabulous. Thank you again!",5,2014,05,08
211,Great Hotel and Service,"Stayed recently in the Croke Park with my wife during a recent visit to Dublin.
Decided to book this particular hotel after reading the reviews on TA. 
I can honestly say I was not disappointed from the moment we arrived until we departed.
All the staff from Main Reception right through to the Restaurant and Bars were extremely friendly and helpful without being overbearing. 
The hotel is approximately a 30 minute walk into the city center, however if you purchase tickets for the Dublin Tour Bus, this picks up and drops off outside the hotel so will save you money on taxi fares. Our room 103 situated on the first floor was directly opposite the lifts and directly above the main entrance, so could be a problem with noise, although I didn't hear any.
We ate in the restaurant on the first night and in the bar on the second night. Both nights the food was excellent and well presented.
Bear in mind if you book this hotel to check there is nothing on at the stadium which is directly across the road as I could imagine it will be extremely busy. 
In a nutshell I would definitely recommend this hotel and I for one will certainly be back",5,2014,05,08
211,Perfect,"My husband,three kids and I spent a very enjoyable night in the Croke Park Hotel. Our room  was lovely, very fresh and clean with all the facilities we needed. In fact the whole Hotel was very clean and fresh looking. The Sideline Bestro was warm, comfortable and nicly decorated.  Our dinner was so teasty and the children's menu was the best I've seen in a while offering healthy child friendly food. My kids were happy to choose from it which is unusual as most kids menus don't appeal to them and they end up choosing from the main menu..Breakfast in the morning was equally lovely and the kids were made feel special when offer Hot Chocolate when they didn't want tea/coffee. We fount the staff very helpful and friendly. The holet is a 15min walk from O'Connell Street and just accross the road from Croke Park, and was easy enough to find. I would stay here again gladly. We felt that we got great value for money. I have said that our sleep quality was only average but I think that may be our own fault. At home we have our own rooms and do not have heating on during the night, so the heat and the crown (5 people)in the room was unusual for us which ment we didn't sleep as good ad we normally would.",5,2014,05,07
211,Excellent Hotel,"The Hotel was lovely, nice big bedroom with comfortable bed. Staff were helpful and friendly.  Excellent on-site car park.  Had dinner in the restaurant, the staff were really friendly but found the food average.  May have struck an off night but we would stay there again.",5,2014,05,07
211,Great Hotel for the Money,"All the usual compliments, great service, clean room, beds were fantastic, etc.

Location is a 10 euro cab ride to Temple Bar area or a 30 min walk through the beautiful city of Dublin

I had one small complaint but it wasn't enough to downgrade the rating, as a caffine addict i like a coffee when i awake and on day 2 they didn't replace the coffee in my room so i had to have tea...sigh..
      ",5,2014,05,07
211,Great Hotel and Staff,"We stayed at the Croke Park for several days in April and could not have picked a better hotel.  The staff were extremely helpful, even calling tour operators to confirm our tours.  The restaurant was superb and the wait staff was great.  The room was comfortable and quiet and the staff provided us with everything we asked.  It is about a 30 minute walk from the center of the city and about a 20 euro trip to the airport.  If you do the City Sightseeing tour buses, they have stop right in front of the hotel (Blue Line Tour). We would stay here again in a heartbeat!!",5,2014,05,07
211,Excellent,"Restaurant was exceptional the food was amazing, couldn't fault it. Staff all so friendly and welcoming.  Room was great, we had a family room which was perfect for the 5 of us and the value for money was fabulous with the Dublin zoo package option. Recommend this hotel and will stay here again.  Have stayed in previous Dublin hotels with our 3 children but this one was by far the best. Highly recommended. ",5,2014,05,06
211,Excellent Service,First time in Dublin couldn't have picked a nicer hotel. Excellent service and lovely hotel. The food was excellent and reasonably priced. The only downside is the location. It is about a 30-40 min walk to the city centre. Would definitely recommend if you don't mind the travel to and from the centre.,5,2014,05,06
211,A quiet restful place to stay!,"Croke park hotel is a clean, quiet place to start and end the day!  If you've been partaking in tours and city events it is nice to retreat to a place that will provide a quiet environment for sleep and relaxation!",4,2014,05,06
211,Valentines Day in Dublin,"Loved the hotel, even got engaged there on Valentines day!

Our room was lovely, the staff were friendly and helpful and the bus driver into town was great fun! 

The walk into town was longer than we expected but we did it a few times and it was ok, would have been better if it wasnt raining!

We will be back for certain!",5,2014,05,06
211,Business value,"Only one gripe - there is only vegetarian option on the restaurant menu (Potato Gnochi) and it has been so ever since I have stayed there. Other than that, it's a great place for a business stay of any type.

211,Chill out comfortable hotel,Excellent hotel whether your trip business or pleasure . Evenings can be spent in bistro / bar where food is excellent and a lovely warm atmosphere. Rooms so comfortable and well equipped. Staff very friendly and nothing seemed too much trouble. ,5,2014,05,03
211,A great experience all round :),"A great hotel with great staff. They really do go the extra mile for their guests. The room (no. 419) was large by Dublin hotel standards and very clean and well kept. The executive lounge was comfortable and provided guests with a  range beverages and some biscuits, fruit and papers to read. The staff were helpful and, knowing it was our anniversary, very kindly provided a few extra treats during our stay. I will definitely stay in this hotel when I return to Dublin.   ",5,2014,05,01
211,Great Place to Stay,"Staff, accommodation and food was excellent.  Only a 20 minute walk to the centre of Dublin and across the road for Croke Park.
Check match dates and book early if necessary.
Bar is a little crowded after matches but so is everywhere!  The Irish certainly like there matches! 

Excellent food for both Dinner & Breakfast

Staff very helpfiul",5,2014,04,30
211,Great stay,"My husband and I recently stayed for a week and had a great time.  We were within 5 blocks of a hop on hop off bus stop. We walked most everywhere. If you are out of shape, you will be spending more money on cabs because the main strip is about a 20 min brisk walk away. And watch for the traffic light down the street towards the strip. One of the very busy intersections does not have a cross walk and it can be pretty scary trying to cross during busy times. ",5,2014,04,30
211,Vacation in Ireland,"The service at the hotel was excellent, the rooms were nice and the staff was friendly.  The hotel is not located in the city center, but we found this to be a positive.  We enjoyed the short walk to O'Connell Street, and on days we wanted a ride the hotel always had us a taxi the moment we wanted it.  The friendly taxi drivers also became an important part of our vacation with their stories, advice, and friendship.  Excellent and very pleased!",5,2014,04,30
211,Croke Park - Great!,"We initially thought the hotel looked a little out of town but it was closer than we realised and the staff were welcoming, friendly and professional. The rooms clean and comfortable. We will stay there again next time we visit. Very recommended! :)",5,2014,04,30
211,Very enjoyable stay!,"Clean and large room with a good, comfortable bed. The bathroom was spacious and equipped with both a bathtub and a shower cabin, which was convenient. Would defnitely recommend this hotel for anyone looking for either please or business, the rooms are really ideal for both!
      ",5,2014,04,30
211,"Good value, good location","Stayed Sunday night past with 3 other family members as we were attending a Gaelic match in Croke Park - so handy & much recommended! 2 double beds in one room which left it great value for money. Although out of the city centre a little, It is possible to walk in about 20 to 25 minutes - even for my mother who is not the fastest walker so location need not be an issue. Restaurant food was absolutely beautiful & reasonably priced at around €20 for 2 courses.",5,2014,04,29
211,Fantastic,"We stopped for three nights at the hotel, it was exceptionally clean and the staff were very friendly. It is a short walk to the centre but staff were very helpful with directions and booking taxis. Would happily stay again.",5,2014,04,29
211,"Great hotel, great price","It was a very pleasant stay in this hotel. The room was very comfortable and the staff super friendly and trying to help out as much as possible.

It is well located in the city, not so far from the attractions and in a calm area.

Will definitely go back anytime",5,2014,04,29
211,"Nice hotel, a little out of town","This hotel is great, nice, clean, modern, great service, and a great breakfast. The only drawback is that it is a little out of the town center and requires a bus ride or taxi to get to downtown Dublin.
Never the less, I would recommend this hotel to anyone.",4,2014,04,28
211,Pleasant Surprise!,"Our family of three just had a wonderful experience during our brief stay in Dublin.  The service was excellent and the downstairs lobby/bar/restaurant were a wonderful experience as well.  The building was also safe and secure and we felt extremely comfortable allowing our 14 year old explore the hotel areas without worry.  Removed from the city center, but still an effortless walk to get there.",4,2014,04,28
211,weekend break,"Lovely weekend break with friends.Hotel very nice modern spotlessly clean. Food excellent. Staff very friendly and helpfull.15/20 minutes walk to centre but taxis or hop on hop off bus available and reasonably priced. Will use this hotel again when we return for another jolly.
",5,2014,04,28
211,Great Value,We stayed at the Croke Park Hotel during our stay in Dublin and was very impressed with the hotel and reasonable cost.  It was a short walk to the center of town.  In the evening is was very easy to take a taxi back at night.  Highly recommend it.  ,4,2014,04,27
211,"Nice bar, shame about the bed",Whole point of our stay was to recover from jet lag prior to getting train the next day. The double bed was one of the smallest I have seen in a hotel. Therefore couldn't have a good nights sleep which was disappointing. Everything else was fairly nice but   was largely irrelevant to us as all we needed was  a good nights kip. ,3,2014,04,27
211,Fab hotel,"We stayed here for 2 nights over Easter break. We checked in on Easter Monday and they had a VIK area with steps up to the desk for the kids to check themselves in. They got sweets, a smoothie, colouring book and crayons. It was a lovely touch.
We had a family room, 2 double beds and a single bed for the 5 of us. It was lovely, plenty big enough, music centre, mini bar, flat screen tv, coffee making facilities. We had free access to the 4 th floor residents lounge which the kids loved. Free juice, fruit, cookies for the kids and a coffee machine, tea for adults. There was Papers and magazines and couches with a big tv. Really nice.
The breakfast each morning was great, loads to choose from and service very fast.
We ate in the bar on one of the night and we were disappointed as the service was very slow. We were relaxed so it wasn't a big deal and the boys were watching the match on the tv but still, would have had 5 stars only for that. It was very good value too at €115 per night for the 5 of us.
We are returning to croke park for the one direction concert but when I enquired about a room it was €305 for a double for the night! Wow! Will have to stay somewhere else this time!
We would definitely stay here again and have already recommended it to friends.",5,2014,04,26
211,Absolutely Fabulous Stay,"Stayed here over the Easter Weekend and had a thoroughly enjoyable stay. The staff were all extremely helpful and courteous. On the saturday night there was a couple singing and playing music in the bar area which really added to the atmosphere. They were fantastic. The room was clean and spacious and the bathroom likewise. On the Sunday night a fire alarm was triggered for about a minute before going off. We awoke to find a letter under our door from the management apologising for the inconvenience which we felt was a great touch of Customer service. Would highly recommend this hotel to anyone wishing to stay in Dublin. On check out we asked for directions to walk into the City and were offered bottles of water for our journey. Fantastic customer service once again.

Many thanks ",5,2014,04,26
211,Fantastic Hotel,"This hotel was amazing! We went on a weekend break and got an absolute bargain as booked on a deals website. We were really impressed the food was great, lovely evening meal and buffet breakfast had loads to offer.

The hotel itself was stunning the rooms clean and very stylish. The bar area is really nice and serve great cocktails. 

Its not too far to the main centre of dublin there are buses from outside to everywhere you would need to get to.

Definitely recommend!",5,2014,04,26
211,Perfect location and stay,"Fabulous stay. Lovely lunch in the bistro. Spacious bedroom, v comfortable beds and fabulous bathroom with super bath. ery friendly, but not officious, staff. Super location within walking distance of O'Connell Street. We went to Hugh Lane Gallery, Garden of Rembrance and Croke Park Skyline tour.  All really enjoyable.",5,2014,04,26
211,Above and Beyond,"After ten flying hours and a cab ride from the airport, I arrived at the hotel at 8 a m on my arrival date, thinking I would store my luggage and get checked in later in the day.  Not so!  The front desk receptionist said she could do some moving around and let me get into my room that early in the day.  No extra charge!  My ""regular"" double room is large, appointed with coffee pot, flat screen tv, feather duvet and pillows and absolutely monster sized bath sheets.  The bathroom is very large with a separate tub, big enough to take a plunge.  Everything looks new...no ""slightly worn"" anything.  When I returned later in the day, I noticed that the photo of the room in the hotel book showed a robe hanging in the closet.  Little did I know that was in the ""superior "" rooms....when I inquired about it via the phone, a robe was immediately sent to me.
There is not one negative thing I can say about this hotel.",5,2014,04,24
211,"Friendly, Courteous Staff","Stayed here for two nights in April 2014.
Friendly, Courteous Staff - Clean, Comfortable Room - Room Service Quick and Delivered with a Smile.
Convenient Bar & Bistro located downstairs.
Breakfast was Buffet style and €14 per person, which we found to be a bit too much for a breakfast buffet.
Location is quite a bit of distance from the city center, but we didn't mind a bit of a walk and a taxi back in the evening was just under €10.",4,2014,04,24
211,Perfect hotel for a get away,"A wonderful hotel to get away. We stayed here during Easter and the service, rooms, were exceptional. Loved the experience. A 10 min walk from o connel though. The rooms were very nice and big. The executive lounge on the 4th floor was also very helpful since we had a kid and always had access to cookies water juice etc. the staff were very knowledgeable and very helpful. Their suggestions and tips were also great. The hotel also has shuttle services and sells hop on hop off tickets etc. so all in all a brilliant place to stay. Gladly recommended. 

      ",5,2014,04,24
211,Beautiful & Friendly!,We stayed in this hotel for 3 nights and it was well worth the price! The beds were comfortable and the room was spacious. The restaurant workers were very friendly and helpful. My companions and I had a wonderful time with the very helpful staff. I would definitely stay here again. If you want to rent a car while in Ireland there is an Enterprise rent-a-car right by this hotel. So save some money with the airport rental and go to Enterprise.  The outside of this hotel is small and deceiving as the inside is full of comfort and beauty as well as FREE parking for residents.,5,2014,04,23
211,Right choice,"Top hotel for a stay in Dublin. Very quite and comfortable. Only a few minutes to walk to the city. Clean and tidy. Friendly staff who helps in every case. Booked the Dublin Tour direct here. You can use a Dublinbus from Airport for les than 3 Euro. 
      ",5,2014,04,23
211,"Good hotel,  would stay again","Good value, very clean and comfortable place to stay, with free and cctv monitored car park. I would recommend staying here if you are a light sleeper as there is little traffic or revellers noise here, compared to the bustling city centre. Although we spent some time travelling by bus, taxis are relatively inexpensive and a much easier option to get into town, and if I were to visit again I wouldn't use the buses. Bus drivers (with one exception) were unhelpful and uncommunicative.  Hotel staff (everyone we encountered including housekeeping,  reception, dining) were very professional and personable and a real credit to themselves and the hotel. ",5,2014,04,23
211,excellent hotel,"we stayed here for one night, the lady at reception whose name i cannot remember but i do think she had Donegal on her nametag? anyway she was extremely helpful, polite and kind.  She asked did my children want to check in at the kids check in area,  as they are 12 i said no thanks.  we were waiting for my husband to park and she came over with free smoothies and bags of sweets, she said they may be too old for checking in but surely arent too old for treats!  i thought it was a lovely gesture which we all appreciated.  THe room was to a very high standard as was the service.  we will definately return.  ",5,2014,04,23
211,Quality and Value,"Great hotel choice for Dublin, if a little out of the centre so need transport. Excellent value for money and very clean.
Great extras like shuttle bus to Hop on Hop off Dublin bus tour.
Breakfast buffet was super, not only choice but food hot and not left to dry out and had great flavour. Loved the fact you were offered proper coffee and hot chocolate from a proper coffee machine not burnt filter as with most hotels.
All in all would recommend and re-visit.",4,2014,04,23
211,Great,Great stay here with the wife. Staff were on the ball and extremely helpful. Its hard to find a good reliable hotel in Dublin nowadays but you provided it without a shadow of a doubt. Breakfast was brilliant with the mass amount on offer which is a good sign as us Irish love a good oul breakfast especially us out west.,5,2014,04,22
211,Excellent Stay,"Stayed here for the week-end with husband, son and daughter-in-law. Great location for Croke Park Stadium which suited us as we were attending a graduation ceremony for my son, but not such a good location for city centre which is about a 20 minute walk away. This hotel is excellent and of a very high standard. We had a standard double room which had 2 double beds which were very comfortable. Room was spotless as was bathroom and had all the necessary toiletries needed, in fact the room hair dryer was probably the best I have ever had in any hotel - great power (which I need for my thick hair), and excellent heat - brilliant!  Staff very friendly and most helpful, nothing seemed to be a bother to them. Excellent breakfast. All in all had a great week-end here, very good hotel.",4,2014,04,22
211,Great Hotel for Dublin visit.,"We booked the Croke Park Hotel after an internet search for a value for money, well located place for a family stay. It ticked all the boxes - maybe a 15-20 minute walk from the city centre, but great VFM and high quality amenities.",5,2014,04,22
211,Great hotel,Was very happy with my stay here! Staff were super friendly and helpful!we ate in the bar and the food was very tasty! Very reasonably priced and good location! Definitely recommend it!worth upgrading to a suite if you can afford it! ,5,2014,04,21
211,First class service,"Our recent stay in this hotel was very relaxing, the staff are excellent and friendly, and the service provided is simply first class. We were made to feel very welcome throughout our stay and the quality of the food was another major plus point! We will definitely return in a few months time. I for one cannot wait!!",5,2014,04,21
211,"Great value, warm welcome","The hotel is located a little out of the city meaning you'll need a taxi to get around if you don't have a car, however this was a minor inconvenience when compared to the warm welcome we received on arrival and the general facilities of the hotel. We arrived on Easter Saturday after almost 26 hours of flying. Check in was quick and it was lovely to be upgraded to have access to the Executive Lounge when they discovered we were on our honeymoon.
The hotel has great lounge, relax areas and my husband was delighted to find the huge screen in the dining area which meant he could see the EPL game as we ate!  I was impressed with the gym, plenty of modern equipment, towels, water and fruit. If you're coming for a game at Croke Park Stadium, this is absolutely the place to stay, it is just across the road
This was our first experience of Ireland and we were very impressed. Cannot speak more highly of the warmth of the staff",5,2014,04,21
211,Great stay - excellent hotel,"Excellent hotel with very friendly and helpful staff. We stayed 2 nights and booked through Secret Escapes - fantastic rate plus upgrade to deluxe room,  free cocktail each for both nights of our stay and access to the Executive Lounge. Great room with proper walk in shower as well as bath, white robes etc . Executive lounge had complimentary tea, coffee biscuits, fruit, bottled water and the option of eating continental breakfast there rather than in restaurant. 
Only downside is that the location is a good 15 mins walk from centre. Taxis cost approx £7 to centre and about £ 20 to and from airport.  Hop on tour bus stops outside hotel several times a day and does do a return run @ 4pm (far too busy drinking Guinness to catch it!)  would recommend and would stay again.",4,2014,04,20
211,Clean and very comfortable,"Very clean, comfortable and welcoming. Staff very helpful. Walking distance from centre and right opposite the stadium. Food in the bar was great. If you get offered a room upgrade then take it - we had a great experience and the 'executive room' was useful with free and delicious breakfast and hot drinks, water etc available all the time.",5,2014,04,20
211,Great Time,"Hotel was excellent , staff were friendly and helpful. The upgrade option for €30 a night was good value for the extra drinks and continental breakfast has things are expensive in the city. About a 15 minute walk into the centre or you can get the green shuttle bus in the morning. ",5,2014,04,19
211,Good hotel. Nit so good location.,"This is a modern hotel with excellent facilities and very accommodating staff. The rooms were clean and comfortable and, whilst it is not a luxury establishment, I can't fault many aspects of the hotel as it is. 
Having said that, it is not in the very centre of town. It's located directly opposite Croke Park and is around a 20 minute walk from the centre. The area itself is a little rough around the edges and I was told by some of the locals and some cab drivers to take care if I was walking alone in the vicinity after dark. Something to be aware of, rather than to put you off from staying.
With that in mind, I would still recommend the hotel for a short stay in Dublin.",4,2014,04,18
211,Excellent stay,"Stayed in this beautiful hotel for last 2 nights and had a fantastic time, room was out of this world so comfortable and spacious.  Luxurious bathroom with both a bath and a shower, bathrobes and slippers......even better was the complimentary prosseco which was waiting in our room for our arrival for my partners birthday....would definitely recommend to friends and visit again....staff were really friendly and helpful.   Also had a lovely meal in the hotel restaurant",5,2014,04,17
211,Great Hotel,"We booked an executive room on the top floor and it was just as we expected having read the reviews.  Immaculately clean, big bathroom with lovely toiletries, nice and quiet with great blackout out curtains.  The hotel kindly included many complimentary items including free drinks and late check out which were much appreciated. The executive lounge was so nice we opted to have breakfast there rather than go to the main dining room as the continental breakfast served there was extensive including smoked salmon and great coffee, they even made fresh toast for us. 

It was great to pop into Dublin on the bus and back to peace and quiet to sleep.  
Thank you to all the staff at Croke Park for a great stay.",5,2014,04,17
211,Perfect stay,"I had read the reviews so expected great service and that is what we got.
We booked a room with access to the executive lounge which was even better than we expected.  Despite being kindly offered a full breakfast in the dining room we opted for a continental in the executive lounge on the second day as the room was so peaceful and the breakfast offered was  surprisingly  extensive despite only being continental.  
Our room was immaculately clean and included many lovely complimentary touches which were really appreciated, especially the late check out. The room was also quiet with great blackout curtains. A  big thank you to everyone at Croke j",5,2014,04,16
211,Very Pleasant Stay,"The service was excellent and provided by a friendly and helpful staff.  Room was spacious with a wonderfully comfortable bed.  A treat to be able to open the window and allow the fresh air into the room.  Breakfast was lovely and coffee was superb.  Location was a little out of the way, but it was worth it.",5,2014,04,16
211,Great,"Small price, great hotel. I travelled with four friends to Dublin to make party and visit the town. The ambiance in the hotel was very well, the only critique is the distance to the middle of the town (approx. 15min to walk), but that's a small issue.

211,CONFORT HOTEL,"this hotel is confort,good breakfast the room has plenty space everything is clean and tidy,quite place to stay,big screen tv.the internet is very fast too.the only thing dosent have good restaurant around,if you have a car or transport you have to go to the city center to find it but we are very close of it, the restaurant in the hotel has good food too and what else we have a good turist place to visit the Croke park Stadium just opposit of the hotel...yeahhhhh good hotel to saty",4,2014,04,16
211,"If to you travel means people, try the Croke Park Hotel, Dublin.","My wife and I were guests at the Croke Park Hotel in Dublin from April 4-9, 2014. I arrived critically ill, needing immediate hospitalization. While I would be incapacitated, of course, my wife would be on her own, a source of concern to me. I need not have worried.
  From the moment we presented ourselves at the desk and announced our situation, the amazing people of Croke Park took over for us. They guided us, transported us, facilitated arrangements at hospital, arranged for delayed air flight home, checked on us constantly. When either or both moved about the hotel, an office staff member seemed always aware and sought us out immediately to offer aid.
  One can tell when a staff are doing their jobs properly and well. But one can also see when they are giving more, when the light in their eyes is not self-satisfaction and pride but the sheer joy of being useful, of truly making live better for other human beings. That was the light shining in the eyes of the Croke Park people.
  In the ways of life, it is unlikely that we shall ever pass that way again. How joyful it will be for us, though, to remember that there exists in that beautiful corner of the world  a haven where one may arrive on the doorstep, unknown, and be welcomed as we were with such warmth and good humor, such kindness and extraordinary care, and such generosity of spirit.
  The Croke Park Hotel is in every way a high-quality place to stay; its 4-star billing accurate -- save for this: even 5 stars would not do justice to its people!

211,Croke Park Hotel,"Hotel staff indifferent/incompetent.  Unable/unwilling to correct minor problems, i.e., programming room keys, bathroom linen.  Also, shower door leaked and flooded floor every time used.  My bad - did not realize hotel located so far from downtown Dublin.  Only nearby ""attraction""  was a football stadium.  A long walk back/forth to bus stop - had to use taxis.             ",2,2014,04,15
211,Great hotel! OK location,"This hotel is fantastic.  The hotel is nice, clean and affordable and the staff are incredibly helpful and attentive.  The location is just OK.  Its a 20+ min walk to OConnell street.  We traveled with small children who weren't crazy about starting and ending each day with a 30 min walk.  There is a shuttle to OConnell street, but only if you purchase the Hop on, Hop off bus tour, which I highly recommend.  In fact, get the 72 hour Freedom Pass, which includes all city buses as well.  The breakfast at the hotel is a must!!  And the food served at the Bistro/Bar is incredible as well.  Try the Irish Stew, my family could not get enough of it.
      ",4,2014,04,14
211,Across from Croke Park Stadium,"Our hotel was part of a Aer Lingus fly/drive/hotel package. We would rate this as a 4 star hotel on 5 star range. It is literally across the street from Croke Park Stadium and fairly easy to find. The hotel was quiet, though, our view point might be different if there was a sports game scheduled during any of the nights we stayed at this hotel. We were very pleased with the quiet rooms 320 and 322 that faced an inner courtyard with no street noise at all. Free parking was located under the hotel. It is about a 10 minute drive to O'Donnell Bridge and the Main Post Office where the initial shootings of the revolution took place in 1916. There are restaurants and local fast-food eateries within a 10 minute walk of the hotel. Downtown all-day parking in an underground garage near the famous National Library reading room was 16 Euros. Hotel staff was very helpful and nice. Our breakfast was included in our package and had a variety of goodies to suit all tastes.",5,2014,04,13
211,Great Hotel with great staff,"Just returned from a short break in Dublin where we enjoyed the best of Irish hospitality at the Croke Park Hotel. The room was a good size and well furnished however the best of all was the service we received. The staff were very friendly and helpful, nothing was too much trouble - they really went out of their way to make sure you had a good stay. Thanks to everyone there.",5,2014,04,13
211,"Great hotel, location not ideal","Firstly I will start with the negatives (there aren't many so it shouldn't take long);

Location - perhaps a little too far out of the city centre, not by a long distance but enough to be a annoying. It's roughly an €8 taxi ride to temple bar, which is obviously not a bank breaker but making many journeys to the sights adds up. Point of note: if you order the taxi to the hotel they charge you slightly more, worth walking outside and round the corner to save a euro or two.

Thats pretty much the only negative for this hotel. 

Amenities - the hotel has what you need, bar restaurant, gym etc... and its all well kept and up to date. The rooms are well set out, again with all the items you would want: tea and coffee facilities, iron etc. Good showers, nice comfy bed and spacious.

Staff - attentive, helpful with an aim to please attitude.

Overall I was very impressed with the hotel. It was efficient, well run and was clean. As a base to explore dublin it is good but the taxis rides might add up. Would stay again if I visit Dublin again.",4,2014,04,13
211,Excellent hotel-value for money,"What can i say about this hotel,i booked it with hotels.com for about 155 for 2 nights and that was with the upgrade with executive lounge,i booked croke park  because it  was number four on trip adviser and was the same price as hotels which were nearer the centre of dublin.The location might not be ideal but as other people have said a walk takes less than 15 mins to the centre.Our room on the fourth level was upto a very high standard and the bathroom  was of a modern design and spotless.If your thinking of coming dublin the croke park hotel will not let you down.",5,2014,04,12
211,Only really if your going to croke park,"I only really choose this hotel because it is near the airport and its proximity to the stadium, I don't feel that this hotel is in the greatest of locations. Public transport is a bit of a walk, and then you will have to change buses from there to get into Dublin city centre. The room was very nice and modern, with all the usual amenities. If you are coming for a game, this is the place to be! If, however, you are visiting Dublin for shopping or site seeing its suggest booking somewhere closer to the actual city centre",4,2014,04,12
211,Excellent value and hotel!,"The amount of money we payed for this hotel is so little for the facilities they were offering! The rooms were very modern, spacious, and fully equipped (shower gel/shampoo etc changed every day, hair dryer, tv had loads of channels, free superfast wifi, and 2 extremely comfortable beds!). The staff was also really polite and we could get taxis to whichever destination within only a minute! Food and drink services were excellent, and so was the gym. Will definitely go there if we're in Dublin again!",5,2014,04,12
211,Excellent,"Really good hotel, location isnt the best; you wont find much around the immediate area but the city centre is walkable if you are very determined (we got a taxi for about 10 euros). The gym and restaurant/bar are very nice too. I would recommend this hotel to everyone who doesn't mind a little extra walking, getting taxis/buses. I definitely thought we had value for money with this.",5,2014,04,12
211,Very nice but....,"This is a very nice hotel in a less than desirable location, adjacent to the Croke Park Stadium. .  We spent two nights and used the hop-on hop off bus to tour the city.   There is nothing within a reasonable walking distance.  Clientele appeared up-scale.  The breakfast which was included is very good.  If you want toast or coffee you'll have to ask for it.  The hotel is clean, modern and secure.  Now my reason this place isn't rated higher. We ate in the hotel pub twice as it was the only option.  Service is nonexistent.  The waiters/waitresses appear to have no assigned area and walk around in a bit of a daze.  We waited at least 30 minutes after eating before flagging down a waiter and asking for our check. He forgot, we asked him again and he brought us a check which wasn't ours and asked us to look at it and tell him if we recognized the order. Basically an hour after we finished we were able to settle up. ..The employees are all very nice but lacked any supervision or focus, it was very bizarre. There is a bar without seating; however twice we ordered and they asked us to sit down at a table and they would ""drop off' the drinks. One safe bet, order at the bar, pay for your drinks, insist on acquiring your drinks & then sit down.  I had the sticky chicken legs and thighs, believe they were some type of game hen or a hybrid mini-chicken as I'd never seen pieces that small..although they were tasty.     There is an illusion of service due to the number of employees..it is an illusion. If you need a place to spend a couple of nights and don't plan on eating dinner at the hotel, or walking to a pub or restaurant this is a 4.   I noticed airline flight crews in the lobby
 

There is a small but adequate exercise facility which was very convenient",3,2014,04,11
211,"4 star hotel,5 star service!","Wow,comfortable beds modern rooms,and an executive lounge where you can make your own cappuccinos all day long or take business calls in private.Gym is good as well.Don' t be fooled by discounted rate,this hotel is upscale,and the service was the best I've experienced in a long time.A taxi from airport Will run you around 15 euros,and the Green Bus tours picks up right at hotel every morning,For Dublin tours.5-10 mins.from city centre.Anything you need is no problem for these folks.restaurant downstairs extremely good for a hotel.Well Done,Croake Park Hotel.",5,2014,04,11
211,"Nice, modern, near airport","To be honest, I was only here for one night, and only because it is near the airport.  Other than its proximity by cab to the airport, and its proximity to the stadium, I don't feel that this hotel is in the greatest of locations.  Public transport is a bit of a walk, and then you will have to change buses from there to get into Dublin proper.  The rooms were very nice and modern, with ample amenities.  If you are coming for a game, this is the place to be!  If, however, you are visiting Dublin for Dublin, this is may not be your best choice due to its location.  It is a modern hotel, not a boutique or historical hotel.  I offer this distinction only because there are so many of both in Dublin, and some definitely prefer one over the other.",3,2014,04,11
211,Delightful hotel,This hotel is in a unattractive part of Dublin but is of course across from Croke Park Stadium. The welcome is immediate and the staff are superb. Our request for a change of room to one with a kingsize double bed was met immediately. The rooms are very comfortable with excellent bathrooms. Breakfast would benefit from having more staff to bring the tea/ coffee and toast but there is lots to choose and it is plentiful. I asked for poached eggs and these were beautifully presented. We weren't rushed at checkout and given bottles of water for our journey. This is a lovely hotel and I would stay there again.,5,2014,04,10
211,Excellent attention,"If the location of the hotel is not that important and you are prepared to walk, this is probably one of the best options. Besides, the green shuttle bus for the city tour hop on and off can take you to and from the hotel to the city centre attractions. The facilities are modern and well maintained and the staff is especially attentive. Excellent ",5,2014,04,10
211,"""How can we thank you enough?""","We trusted the Croke Park Hotel's staff and management with one of the most special days of our life, our ""Wedding Day"".  While the wedding itself was in the stadium across the road, both our families and guests were treated with the up-most of care and hospitality.  This was so apparent, that all of our guests commented on this fact.

From the moment we arrived every detail of our stay was catered for from the hot towels being offered at reception, upgrades to the fourth floor (executive level), fantastic food in the bar and the restaurant as well as the friendliness of the staff.  Sean,  Stephen, Ian and Catherine to name but a few were amazing.

We stayed in the executive level with a private lounge and all day continental breakfasts/free bottled water/teas and coffees.  This added greatly to our stay as at times, a private area to 'catch your breath' was essential.

We would highly recommend staying here and no doubt we will be staying here again!!",5,2014,04,09
211,Excellent value,"The hotel is opposite Croke Park stadium and easy to access by public bus from the airport, it is about a10 minute walk to O Connell Street. The staff were all very polite and helpful, the room was very clean and comfortable, our only problem was the key card which activates the lift and opens the door to your room, ours regularly failed to work and had to be replaced twice.",4,2014,04,09
211,A perfect weekend away,"Just a short note to say that this hotel is supurb. Great service, spotless, spacious. And great little extras. A little way from city centre but i liked that as it meant you could have the best of both worlds. We had room on 4th floor with access to executive lounge which had water juice and tea/coffee etc all day. Then continental breakfast in the morning. We  had b&b so breakfast was great too. Lots of choice and hot. The foid in sideline bistro was also fab. We had club sandwich/wrap. Very nice chouce and very filling. All in all a perfect weekend for us. And would definatley stay here again.",5,2014,04,09
211,Great hotel....,"From the moment i checked in I was treated like a VIP....upgraded to the 4th floor (423) and all that that entails...like the sexy lounge area for 4th floor guests!

The bar area was bustling and i had a fab chicken breast and fresh mango even when the kitchen had already closed (9;30pm)..While people watching in the lobby I noticed some staff discreetly fluffing up cushions and tidying up magazines and newspapers...they could have done that sort of thing if they thought i was watching,,,that wasnt the case and that is why the Hotel has enjoyed such popularity. I guess i could go on a bit about the location...but i prefer to leave that as a detail...just cab it for  goodness sake.!",4,2014,04,08
211,Croke Park,"Had a really enjoyable visit. The room was comfortable and a good size. The staff were very friendly welcoming and helpful. We really enjoyed the food, breakfasts and evening meal. The shuttle bus linking the hotel with the hop on hop off bus was really handy. The only downside is the view from the hotel, the area is not attractive, but feels fairly safe.",5,2014,04,08
211,awsome,"Not a complaint. Everything was excellent. No pool, but that is normal for that climate.Price was very reasonable. Very easy walk to town center. Beds and bathroom were as good as we have encountered. We would stay there again.",5,2014,04,08
211,Excellent service,"From the moment we arrived you could tell this place had its service spot on. Friendly, efficient and genuine. Rooms were great and cleaned to a very hight standard (apparently award winning) a little bit out of town ..about 8 euros taxi. City tour bus has a shuttle in the morning. Food was good. Executive lounge also a nice extra if you pay for an upgrade. I would stay here again",5,2014,04,07
211,Very good but some slow service,A fantastic hotel very clean and pleasant the one problem we had was after eating our mains at the bar we were left with the plates on the table for 30 mins before they were cleared with all the staff walking past without paying attention to these making us decide not to have dessert or coffee. The rooms were fantastic and clean and the breakfast was amazing ,4,2014,04,07
211,1st week of april 2014.,"If you need a buisness class hotel not so far away from the center (appx. 15 min by feet) in a quite place - this is your choice. (If there are no games on the stadium i suggest) Staff is really responsive. Special thanx to the elderly concierge, very racy and professional guy!",5,2014,04,07
211,Excellent hotel,"Great value for money, excellent service, lovely big and well furnished, clean rooms. Excellent breakfast in a nicely decorated setting with lovely music in the background. It cost me only 11 euros to get to the hotel from the city centre by taxi on Saturday evening. 5 mins walk to buses. 10 mins ride to the city centre. I would definitely go back.",5,2014,04,06
211,Good stay,"Staying here in February, stayed in other Doyle collection hotels so I knew it would be good. Rooms good and breakfast was nice also, Sophie was very helpful and professional and she's a credit to the hotel. Bar was nice but service not so good, told sit down anywhere that's perfectly normal but no one came to us for 10 minutes and had to get up to get menus, food was nice but empty glasses left on table etc but that's just being fussy! Overall beautiful hotel, good staff and wonderful stay!",4,2014,04,05
211,"Decent price, good value",This hotel is slightly away from the center or town but it is a great value for the money you save. The hotel staff is very accommodating and the rooms and clean and look like they were recently renovated. Don't forget to put your room key in the machine to operate the light switch. - it took our group a while to figure that one out!,4,2014,04,03
211,Better than average,"Location was good for us as we attended a match in Croke Park Stadium. Otherwise location is a small bit down at heel. Industrial units everywhere and shops - none to be seen. Hotel itself was good but if I was an ordinary stayer (not going to the game) I would be unhappy with plastic glasses, high and very visible security who seemed to disappear when trouble did start as well as very inexperienced bar staff who gave incorrect change. Did not eat in the hotel as we had already eaten. Receptionist was very pleasant. Family room (4 people) was set up for 2 guests. Beds were excellent and the room was very quiet and a very nice temperature. TV was very good. Parking was excellent and free! Would I go back? Yes.",4,2014,04,02
211,A Great Deal!,The staff was very helpful. The location was close to city center.  My room and upgrades had all the amnesties I am used to. The better/safer location is the South Side but I was closer than the south side prison Hilton and other hotel options.  If this hotel was at Trinity College it would be perfect!,4,2014,04,02
211,Great location and Great service,"Stayed her for a weekend and location is very good for city centre. Breakfast was usual hotel fare, nothing exceptional. Room and hotel were very well maintained and clean and the service from the staff was excellent. Our room was near the lift and there was some disturbance hearing people coming and going but nothing too bad. Would stay here again! Oh also free underground parking which was very helpful!!",4,2014,04,02
211,Nice Hotel,"Overall Croke Park is a nice hotel. The downside is the location. Unless you are there for an event at the stadium, the location is not convenient for anything. Additionally, it's in a semi-industrial area and the back of the hotel overlooks a dingy industrial area. If not for the location I would rate this hotel as very good. 

The plus is the staff is excellent. The people at the reception area were great. Went out of their way to make sure you were taken care of. They were well trained and check in was easy. Additionally the breakfast included with the room was very good. They had a nice secure parking area if you have a car which was another plus. 

Overall very nice but really depends on the purpose of your visit.",3,2014,04,01
211,this hotel has the lot,"Stayed in The Croke Park on many visits to Dublin,it has the lot,staff are more than helpful,very professional in all aspects of their work with knowledge of Dublin first class,rooms are excellent,comfy,warm and spotless,the food is brill,i recommend the breakast,perfect way to begin your day",5,2014,04,01
211,Great Hotel for all,Throughly enjoyable experience staying at this hotel. Great location to enjoy the Gaelic football and close enough to centre. All staff were efficient and hopeful making the long weekend break even more enjoyable.,5,2014,04,01
211,Fabulous Hotel,Stayed here Sat 29th March with my husband for 1 night.  We paid €85 for a double room B & B (Travel Republic site).  The hotel was lovely - very contemporary design and the staff at reception and in the dining room were fantastic.    There is free underground car parking for hotel guests which is a great surprise and most unusual in Dublin.   We ate in the Sideline Bistro on Saturday evening - the food was wonderful and beautifully presented.  Breakfast on Sunday morning was very tasty with a great choice but be warned that there was a massive queue waiting for a table at 10.00 a.m. when we were leaving the dining room.   The bedroom was lovely with all the facilities you would expect - I found the bed to be very comfortable but the pillow was way too plump for me.  The en-suite had a shower and a bath and a full range of toiletries.    The only downside for me was the very slow service in the bar on Saturday night and the fact that drinks were served in plastic glasses.  I know that there was a crowd in after the Dublin -v- Mayo football match and that the plastic glasses are a practical measure but they certainly don't provide for a positive customer experience.,5,2014,04,01
211,Fantastic hotel fantastic weekend ...,Me and err indoors and our two best friend's visited Dublin for the first time and stayed at the croke park hotel ..I'm lost for words the hotel. ..the staff  where fantastic helpful  the food amazing and just a short cab ride the to pubs. . clubs and restaurants ...if you want a fantastic weekend book now....,5,2014,03,31
211,Night away,I stayed here over the weekend with my hubby and friends. The staff were very friendly and there was nothing to much for them. The room was lovely and had a bath and a shower. The beds were the best I have slept in a hotel and could have stayed all night. We had dinner in the restaurant and it was great the staff there was also very nice mum husband and friend went off to the game right across the road and my friend and I stayed in the bar which had screens showing the game. The only thing about the hotel that I didn't like was that as soon as the game was over and people were coming in our drinks were served in a plastic glass. Thankfully I had my glass but the boys didn't and it's just not the same. Breakfast was just as good as dinner and all you could it. I would stay here again but I think that maybe a resident bar on match night might be a better option.,5,2014,03,31
211,Special place to stay.,"My husband and I stayed at this hotel on Saturday 29th March, i requested a nice room as it was for my husbands special birthday, this request was meet and to our suprise we got champagne on ice delivered to our lovely room.  The staff in all of the hotel were brillant, friendly, efficient. We dined in the sideline restaurant and the food and staff were fab.",5,2014,03,31
211,An excellent choice,"An absolute gem of a hotel for conferences at Croke Park. Great service from all hotel employees, down to cleaning staff greeting me every single morning! The business centre staff were excellent, the wifi throughout the hotel was very reliable.  All in all a completely stress-free experience, as required when travelling for business.
      ",5,2014,03,31
211,Excellent hotel,"Excellent hotel with high standards, good food and friendly staff.  Very convenient location and plenty of parking on site.  Room was very clean and in good condition with nice comfortable furniture, a decent tv and a music system also.  Bathroom spotless and nice to have a separate shower and bath
      
      
      ",5,2014,03,31
211,One of the best hotels I've been,"I came to Dublin for a meeting at the Croke Park conference in the stadium, the Croke Park hotel is just in the front, so the position was perfect. Buses are also available not far from the hotel and it takes only some minutes to have a taxi, if you need it. Employees were kind and helpful and my rook was very nice. A good range of tea available in the room. One strange thing: there was no toilet brush n the bathroom. The breakfast lacks of choices for yoghurts and fruits, though there were a lot of things for the strong german/irish/english breakfasts.",5,2014,03,30
211,Hotel of High Quality,Really enjoyed my short visit to Dublin's Croke Park Hotel. Perfect for me the business traveller who wants a relaxing night without the hustle and bustle of City Centre Dublin. Everything about the hotel was very good apart from the breakfast dining room which was a bit of a bun fight but this wouldn't stop me staying there again. Staff really nice and helpful.,4,2014,03,30
211,"Great hotel in Dublin, excellent value for money!","We stayed at the hotel for 1 night on a sightseeing trip from England. 
We took the no. 16 bus from the airport to Drumchondra, using a €2.90 bus ticket that allowed 90mins unlimited travel. This gave us time, to drop our bags off at the hotel and get back on the bus into dublin. You can catch the number 40 (10mins walk from hotel) to just past the hospital on the other side of the city to visit Kilmainham jail. Well worth a visit.
Our room was clean, modern and spacious. We ate in the hotel at the sideline bistro and food was really good, costing about €20 for a main. We also had a complimentary breakfast included, which was excellent and served till 10.30, meaning we could have a lie in! Hotel also has free wifi throughout and access to computers and printers, allowing us to book 10% off tickets to the Guinness Storehouse.
Really can't fault the hotel, it's a 15 minute walk into the centre, but we found getting around easy, using the local buses. Alternatively you can use the tourist buses €15 for a 2 day pass which does stop outside the hotel. For £70 a night including breakfast this hotel was excellent value for money, a real 4 star with great service from staff. Would definitely return.",5,2014,03,29
211,Friendly staff make this Hotel,I am a frequent business customer and consistently my experience in this hotel is uplifting because every employee you meet throughout the hotel greets you with a warm friendly smile. The hotel itself is presented in a warm modern style and the overall atmosphere is professional and warm. The food is excellent but a menu change would be welcome for us frequent visitors.,5,2014,03,29
211,A relaxing trip to Dublin,"We spent 3 nights at Croke Park Hotel and were very comfortable. Some nice touches such as hot towel on arrival to freshen up and we were asked if we would like some bottled water to take with us at check out for the journey home.
We had a deluxe room on the fourth floor, which comes with access to the executive lounge area with complementary drinks available as well as continental breakfast should you not want to use the restaurant.",5,2014,03,28
211,"Very nice hotel, a true 4 star","I stayed for 3 nights at the Croke Park Hotel. The rooms are very good, excellent quality of sleep and good equipment in the rooms, including free and good WiFi, a ironing board and a trouser press, and a kettle to make your own tea or coffee. The toilet had both a bath tub and a shower. The neighborhood is quiet and the hotel bar is lively with a good selection of beer and food and a very nice atmosphere. The breakfast was very good, not the best I had in a 4 star hotel, but surely a 4 start breakfast. If I was the manager, I would change a couple of thing: the TV channel selection in the rooms is very limited, almost no foreign channels; the pressure of the water in the shower was a bit low, I could not have a really invigorating shower as I enjoy; the staff for the breakfast room is not as expedite and not as customer focused as the staff in the rest of the hotel.

The hotel is some 15 or 20 minutes away from the centre of Dublin, and I used a taxi to connect to the airport (20€ the trip to the hotel, 15€ the trip to the airport). 

Moreover, if you are planning a conference, the Croke Park Statium, just across the street has very good rooms.

I can return to this hotel easily, its a good place to stay and a good value for money.",5,2014,03,27
211,"Excellent hotel, great place to stay","We stayed here on a Secret Escapes booking. we thought it was good value with a taxi ride, guinness storehouse entry and a free cocktail included but we were even more thrilled with the hotel when we finally got there. 
Yes it is a little out the way, 15-20min walk into the centre but it walked off all the Guinness and food we consumed!
Rooms were excellent, all amenities included, the Sideline Bar was very good and not too pricey for a hotel. Breakfast was first class and the reception staff absolutely faultless!!!
Would definately recommend",5,2014,03,26
211,Wish we stayed more than one night!,The staff was probably the nicest hotel staff I have ever dealt with.  They gave a great recommendation for a place to eat and took the time to draw on a map of how to get to the various places we wanted to go.  The hotel is beautiful and well kept.  We really wish we could have stayed one more night to enjoy the hotel more.,5,2014,03,25
211,"Clean, modern and comfortable","My stay here was very good, no complaints about the hotel. It was clean , and very comfortable. The blackout in the room is amazing so you can sleep until midday and you wouldn't have a clue! The safe was very helpful and pleasant. The only drawback is that its not within close proximity of the city centre unless you dance lots of walking. A cab would cost on average 10 Euro to get to the city centre.",4,2014,03,25
211,Awesome Hotel!,"I just visited Ireland between March 14-March 22, 2014. We stayed at Croke Park everynight. The hotel is very modern and the rooms were clean and the beds were very comfortable. The front desk staff were very helpful aswell as the conceriege. The location wasnt right in down town but it was close to the airport and the highway to leave the city for sightseeing which was very convenient. When asking the fronnt desk to call a cab they were always there before we even walked out the front door to wait and it is about 7-10 euro to cab dowtown. There is also a shuttle that leave form there in the moring and comes back in the afternoon that is free if you buy a Hop on Hop off bus pass. It is well worth the money if you are touring around downtown Dublin. There are many stops and you just get on and off. Very cool. If i go back to Ireland I would definately stay here again. The rooms were spcaious. We had to double beds with worked great. The bathroom was huge and modern.

The food was really good aswell. The only thing I wish they would have had was a fridge in the room to buy groceries becuase the food can get expensive. But maybe it was just our room that didnt have one. im not sure if there are rooms with fridges or not.

But overall it was a great hotel and I do recommend it. ",5,2014,03,25
211,One of the best hotels there is!,Loved our stay here-kids didn't want to go home:) Beautiful staff especially Aoife & Daniela. Fantastic food. Lovely Manager Sean is just an asset to this hotel. Very comfortable & in my opinion 5 star and more in every way. Thanks for everything. We will be back for sure x x,5,2014,03,23
211,Wedding November 2013,"Great Hotel, we planned our wedding reception there and the staff really helped make our day wonderful.  From planning our meal, to looking after our guests,no detail was too small. Our guests are still talking about the wonderful biscuits provided with the tea and coffee as we were waiting for the meal.  And everyone loved the meal.",5,2014,03,21
211,Friendly and ticks all the boxes,"The hotel is easy to access fro the north of Ireland and has great parking facilities. It is very wheel chair friendly and the staff will really go out of their way to help you. There is a great range of food and it is available at most times of the day. The hotel catered for my wife's birthday with a small bottle of champagne and were very attentive to all our needs. This hotel is as good as we have been in and certainly treat you as you would expect to be treated, no swimming pool but we know this before we arrived.",5,2014,03,20
211,Fantastic - but a little far out of town,"Great hotel, rooms good, staff great and breakfast was immense. Only downside is a bit of a walk into town, meaning we did a taxi back after an evening of guinness. Taxi costs €10 from o'connell st. Has a gym, but not a pool.
",5,2014,03,20
211,CROKE PARK MARCH 2014,"Excellent service, ambience and quality of room.  Really couldn't fault the hotel at all. Only downside was that it is a little bit of a walk out of town (approx. 20 mins) but reception were able to get a taxi for you in no time at all.
      
      
      ",5,2014,03,19
211,"Fantastic stay, great staff","We stayed for one night in the hotel as we were going to the Country to Country concert in the 02. Our room was very spacious with 2 double beds and a seating area. Fresh fruit  and water was provided in the room which was a lovely touch.The room and bathroom was spotless and the beds very luxurious.  At night the hotel was very quiet  and we weren't disturbed with noise from the other guests even though we stayed over the busy St Patricks' weekend. We had booked a deluxe room which included breakfast and access to the executive lounge on the fourth floor. There was complimentary tea/coffee, fruit, water, shortbread biscuits. Guests could relax in the lounge with a coffee and watch TV or browse through the papers. Breakfast was also served in the lounge and was plentiful with fresh fruit, cereals, croissants, pancakes and very enjoyable.   The staff were excellent, from the reservation office who answered my queries prior our stay, to the reception staff  and restaurant staff . Everyone was very professional and helpful. Parking is free for residents  in the underground car park attached to the hotel which was a great bonus. We walked into the city centre which was about a 15 minute walk. Probably best to take a taxi if you're going at night though.  O2 is an easy 5 min drive away. We enjoyed our stay so much we have already booked again for later in the year. Can't wait",5,2014,03,19
211,Faultless,"Spent St Patricks weekend in Dublin and stayed two nights in Croke Park Hotel! On first arriving the hotel is simple and unassuming but once inside you realise just how good an establishment this is!
Staff friendly and professional, rooms spotless and comfortable, food at bar excellent and the wine list good!! 
Great value and will be back for sure!!! Thank you for a memorable weekend",5,2014,03,18
211,beware,"good hotel. can get over ran with people at times. staff try very good to keep up but get over run at times.
always keep your receipt for drinks or food got.
we were telephoned 5 days after we left to pay a drinks bill of 35 euros which we had left the cash for. we had not got a receipt so we paid again .",3,2014,03,18
211,Lovely Hotel,"I stayed in Croke Park Hotel for 4 nights last week while attending a training course not too far away from it.  I must say it is one of the nicest hotels I have stayed in in a long time. The rooms are lovely and spacious and the bathroom is huge and that was just a standard room. The service there was outstanding from the girls on the check in desk to the bar and cleaning staff. Breakfast was lovely and they were very understanding of any dietry requirements (I am gluten intolerant!). I ate in the bar the first night and food was lovely and reasonably priced. Parking was free for guests which was a big plus for me as very few hotels have free parking anymore and it was great that you could take a lift straight from your own floor down to the car park without having to go through the hotel or outside!  A real hassle free hotel. 

If I wanted to be nit picky the only thing that I didn't like is that you had to pay for water. I think most hotels usually provide water free of charge (even if it is just tap water!)  but unfortunately it was €3 for a bottle of Riverock which I think is a crazy price for a small bottle of water. But like I said this was being nit picky ...just bring your own water! 

Overall a fantastic hotel and I would definitely go back ....just wondering when my next training course will be so I will have a good excuse :)",5,2014,03,18
211,First Trip to Dublin,"The accommodation and service of this 4 star hotel are exceptional, starting  from the warm flannels on arrival to the complimentary bottled water for your journey upon check out. Central Dublin is only 20 minutes walk away, Temple Bar slightly further.  First trip to Dublin and what a time to go - the start of St Patrick's Festival.  It was crazy but we loved it.   ",5,2014,03,17
211,Great hotel,My parner and I stayed here on Saturday 15 March and really enjoyed our stay here. The food was excellent also the room and facilities.  Staff were very helpful and pleasant adn we would definitely recommend and stay here again!!  Well Done to all!!,5,2014,03,17
211,Excellent,"A lovely hotel from Check In to Check Out. Staff were lovely, room was excellent with both a shower and a bath. Bed was huge and very comfortable so a great night's sleep. Breakfast was great with a good variety of both hot and cold. Had an evening meal in the Sideline Bistro, which was both reasonably priced and cooked extremely well. Would recommend the Italian restaurant a two minute walk away called Asti for some great pizzas. Free wifi throughout the hotel, computers with printers to print out return boarding passes. It takes about thirty minutes to walk into the centre or about €7-9 in a taxi.",5,2014,03,15
211,Extremely warm welcome,"We stayed here for 3 nights just before St Patrick's weekend - excellent base to explore the lovely city of Dublin.  We were made extremely welcome and I have to say that many hotels I have visited in England could take lessons from the Croke Park in how to make guests feel valued. There is a very useful 'hop-on-hop-off' bus service which stops right outside the hotel and makes it extremely easy to get around Dublin I would definitely stay here again.  Also, great breakfast buffet :)",5,2014,03,15
211,excellent hotel with the friendliest staff ever!,"We stayed at this hotel, in March, whilst on a short break to Dublin having got a bargain price on a hotel booking site..We arrived very early but were able to check in and leave the hire car in the secure car park (free) and our bags with the concierge.We were offered lovely warm flannels to freshen up after our flight.

Our room was extremely clean and comfortable and had everything we needed and more. A very comfy bed and a lovely big bathroom with bath and separate shower cubicle. There was a good hair dryer and free safe plus the usual tea/coffee etc.
 We had breakfast included which was very good - a nice selection of food and all good quality ingredients - I loved the pancake maker!. The complimentary newspaper was a nice touch.  We ate in the Sideline Bistro on 2 nights which we really liked - the food and service were good and priced on par with other places in Dublin. It has a nice relaxed atmosphere and is a comfortable place to chill after a day out. 
The hotel is a little way from the city centre but as we had booked the Green Dublin Bus 2 day hop on hop off ticket we had a free shuttle into the city after breakfast and back in the late afternoon. Excellent value - we booked this on the website and it  only cost 30 Euros for 2 people for 2 days. 
The hotel is contemporary and comfortable with some nice detail - we particularly liked the flame wall in the bar. I have to say that the biggest asset this hotel has are the staff who were without exception lovely - very professional, friendly and helpful to all their guests. Nothing was too much trouble and we would not hesitate to return or recommend. They should be proud of the service they offer at the Croke Park Hotel.",5,2014,03,14
211,I wish I could give six stars,"When we booked our travel, we told the agent we were going to be on our honeymoon, and the Croke Park Hotel was the only place that noticed that and they went out of their way to make the stay very special. There were chocolates and champagne delivered to our room, which was upgraded. The staff were so nice to us. It was really very special. 

The location is great too, just a bit of a walk to the city center, where there's lots to see and do. The rooms are very clean and nicely furnished. Free wifi with good speeds, too! Not too far from the airport.

I will definitely stay here again next time I come back to Dublin. Wow!",5,2014,03,14
211,Great Hotel,"Stayed at the Croke park hotel as saw good reviews on trip advisor. Checked in early as we caught the 6.30am flight and were given rooms straight away, unfortunately we had been put in a disabled room on the fourth floor and the bathroom was stark and unwelcoming,not what you would expect when booking an executive room, but we were moved when more rooms became free and had an excellent stay. Staff were very helpful and polite, breakfast was amazing and the hotel was very clean and tidy. It took about 10-15 minutes to walk into o'connell street but the weather was good and we took taxis in the evening which cost about 12 euros for 4 of us.",5,2014,03,14
211,Excellent,"A lovely hotel within reach of city centre. Service second to none, friendly staff who really seemed happy in their work. It also hosts a well equiped gym and the bistro has a varied menu. It was very useful to have access to computer so online checkin can be done. Highly recommended.",5,2014,03,14
211,"Great Hotel, will recommend","I was at the Croke Park hotel for 3 nights, and had an event in one of their conference rooms on the Friday. 

The hotel is amazing. Free Wifi service is the best I have ever seen, with download speeds of 80 Mbps. The rooms are huge and very comfortable, with a great working area, a TV and a stereo (which I didn't use). Breakfast was really good. 

The only downside was that there are not a lot of resturants nearby, however, the city centre is only a short taxi ride away. The airport is also not far away at all. 

The only siggestion I would have is maybe for a guide to the local area to be provided to guests, with maps, and instructions on taxis, etc.",5,2014,03,13
211,Great city hotel.,"We stayed in The Croke Park hotel on the 19th of February and really enjoyed our stay. The hotel is an ideal location for a shopping trip to the city. We were welcomed and checked in by very friendly professional staff. 
We were lucky to be staying in The Sam Maguire Suite which was accomodation of the highest standard, spacious and very comfortable. Great dining table and seating area in the suite separate to the bedroom. We had access to the llounge upstairs where there was a continuous supply do coffee, water and fruit.
We had lunch in the bar after check in and I would highly recommend the sea food chowder.
We also had dinner in the dining room that night and were very pleased with the food, service and ambience.
Over all, the Croke Park hotel is a great place to stay while in Dublin, modern decor, comfortable rooms and very friendly professional staff.
I would like to take this opportunity to thank Killian and all the stFf for looking after us so well.
Hope to return and stay again soon.",4,2014,03,13
211,First Class,"this was a super hotel with great staff. The room was very clean. It was very good value for money and nothing seemed to be too much trouble. There was a nice touch the morning we checked out when we were offered a bottle of water for our journey home. I'd definitely go back here again. Hopefully they will keep this standard up.

211,Lovely Hotel and very friendly staff,"My Mum and I stayed over in ""The Croke Park Hotel"" on Tuesday 11th March for one night. We were up for a shopping trip. It is also near the city centre.

When we arrived at the Hotel the staff was very friendly and helpful. The hotel was very clean and there is free on sight secure parking. Breakfast was very good, the staff were very friendly and attentive.

I would highly recommend this Hotel, would definitely stay again!!!",5,2014,03,12
211,Very comfortable stay,"Stayed in Croke Park for two nights in March 2014. Very good hotel, great rooms, very clean, scrumptious breakfast. Would stay there again and would recommend to anyone. Central to city - just fifteen minutes walk into O'Connell Street.",5,2014,03,12
211,Christmas gift.,"Our adult children gave us a present of a stay in the Croke Park Hotel and my brother and his wife gave the same to my sister and her husband,  To say it was great form start to finish would be an understatement it was fantastic.  From the time we arrived until we left we were treated like royalty we would highly recommend this hotel.  Great location, great staff, so stand up and take a bow. I have already hinted that is what we want for next Christmas.",5,2014,03,11
211,"Lovely hotel, friendly staff","We stayed here for one night to go and see a show. This was a mystery hotel purchase so we were very pleasantly surprised. We got a taxi to and from venue with hotel staffs help. They were really helpful with everything. We got hot towels to freshen up on arrival and free bottles of water on departure. Breakfast was really good and bar staff made us cocktails we asked for that were not on menu. Very attentive and friendly staff, lovely room, nice hotel - will definitely be back ",5,2014,03,11
211,Concert Getaway,"Great location. Good 15min walk to the city centre.  Friendly staff.  Clean, well kept hotel.  Free onsite secure parking at the hotel
Breakfast selection was excellent.  
Would definitely stay here again.

211,Welcome to Dublin 1st class,"Excellent and friendly staff, room was great and good gym. This was our first night of a week vacation all over the country...and it was a great start! Free secure parking under hotel. Walking distance to great local dining. Clean and very modern. For non city people, this hotel is quiet and nice to return to after a hectic day driving the city. Thanks to staff and management! 
",5,2014,03,10
211,very pleased,"We went there for one  night only, 3 people. Very nice, clean place, very friendly staff. One thing I wasn't happy with is that the radio couldn't get any channel. Breakfast delicious with a big selection of food. 

      ",5,2014,03,10
211,EXCELLENT HOTEL SUPER STAFF,"terrific greeting by friendly efficient staff hot towel most welcome after  flight and taxi ride. Walked into city centre about 15 mins area around the hotel is quite run down but taxis plentiful and fairly reasonable (one tip if you are in Temple Bar make the few minute walk across any bridge over the river and pick up a cab on other side as there is a one way system in place which will add quite a few euro to the journey)  Hotel room clean and comfortable, we went with Son and his partner, our room had plenty of electric sockets but their room had hardly any and none anywhere near a mirror.   We did eat breakfast once but expensive compared to plenty of full irish breakfasts to be had in city centre.",5,2014,03,09
211,A beautiful experience,"We were greeted with a smile and a warm damp wash cloth! Accommodations were wonderful as were the drinks in the bar. The best thing we experienced was Stephen, the concierge!  What a wonderful help, guide and personality!!He took care to see that we were going in the right direction+ getting on the right transportation.",5,2014,03,09
211,Very nice hotel.,"Have just stayed at The Croke Park Hotel,  lovely hotel, free parking, decor very nice, beds very comfortable, utilities the best ie.... Decent large towels & good hair dryer, tea/coffee facilities. Big plus, on check out we were given 2 bottles of water for our journey home. It is a little gesture with big meaning. Well done. Will definitely recommend this hotel.  
If I had to make one comment it is to management to consider buying its front of house staff new bright, attractive, well fitting uniforms....the current apparel is dark, drab & ill fitting.",4,2014,03,09
211,High Expectations Fell a Little Short,"Fantastic reviews for this hotel on Tripadvisor which led to very high expectations.  In the main it was really good but 'good' was the operative word.  Bistro food was 'good' room was 'good' bar was 'good' (but a little expensive), shower was OK.  High point was the King Koil bed.  Low point was the unappetising poached eggs which arrived in a bowl of 'eggy' water.  Overall, it felt a little bit too much like a Jury's Hotel (which it used to be) where a very high throughput of guests tends to have a negative impact on standards.  Hard to put a finger on it really but my takeaway view was that the TA reviews are a little bit on the generous side.",4,2014,03,09
211,Fantastic stay,"I stay in a lot of hotels in Dublin and this one is exceptional , from the friendliness of the staff on the hotel reception to be greeted by a hot towel to the amazing staff in the bar who were amazing I did not get the 2 bar men's names to the checkout

211,Superb Croke Park Hotel is a Dublin gem,"As a sports writer I have travelled extensively and stayed in many fine hotels. But after visiting the Croke Park Hotel for a week from January 21-28 I can honestly say this excellent. Dublin hotel ranks with the very best I have stayed in. What makes the Croke Park stand out is the warmth and professionalism of the staff and their attention to every detail. My wife and I were given a spacious and attractive room on the third floor that came with balcony and a beautiful bathroom. The room was luxurious and like the rest of the hotel spotlessly clean.We had access to the executive lounge on the fourth floor which provided complimentary continental breakfast and free tea and coffee plus biscuits, fruit etc at any time of the day. One of many lovely little touches
that made our stay special. Also worth mentioning is the impressive free wifi and free parking plus the well-equipped gym. The full Irish breakfast was a sight to savour and even when the hotel was busy the service remained impressively professional. We ate several times in the restaurant and the Sideline bar and were impressed by the quality of both the food and service. During the day we enjoyed the 15 minute stroll to O'Connell Street and the City Centre. At night a taxi ride was around 8 Euros. All in all an extremely attractive, enjoyable and well-run hotel that in my opinion provides the best value for money in Dublin. Will definitely return to the Croke Park on my next Dublin visit and look forward to sampling some of the other properties in the Doyle Collection.",5,2014,03,07
211,Great Hotel for Dublin,"The hotel is spacious and modern with a fine fitness center, excellent, fair-priced restaurant and bar and within a fifthteen-minute walking distance of Dublin's major tourist sites. Outstanding staff who make your stay pleasant and enjoyable. 
 
      
      ",5,2014,03,07
211,Excellent staff and super food,"We came here on a midweek afternoon and found the staff charming, chatty and very friendly. We ordered from the pub menu and were pleased and surprised - both by the menu options and by the quality of the food served. The chef passed by and was in immaculate whites and nodded hello. The manager passed and also was 'heads up' and greeted us like old friends. We will be back.",5,2014,03,07
211,Very enjoyable(Evening meal in Sideline Bistro aside),"Very enjoyable stay...hotel very clean and bright and spacious. Booked a voucher package deal and found set menu very restrictive and not very appetising at all. Asked if we could order from white a la carte menu and after server had spoken to manager we were told that we must order our starters and desserts from the green set menu and that we could order a main course from the a la carte menu but that we would be charged a €5 supplement per head for this despite the fact that most of the main courses (the steak aside) were of a similar value or within €1 of the value of the potato gnochhi at €14.95 which was on both menus. We expressed our dissatisfaction with this and asked to speak to the manager. When the manager came it was as if it had been a different manager from the one which the waitress had been speaking to as she was informing us that we must order from the set menu. Offer 2 was the original offer of a main course from ""a la carte"" menu at €5 charge supplement per head. Eventually offer 3 came which was ""we will make a special allowance just this once and let you order a main from a la carte at no extra cost"". We reluctantly agreed to this as it seemed as if it appeared to be the final option being offered. My wife had the carrot and butternut squash for starter and i had the smoked salmon both of which were rather bland. The main courses of burger & chips and fish & chips from the a la carte menu were very tasty and the best course as they were disappointingly followed by a tasteless 'baileys' cheesecake for dessert. Service was also very slow and one family of 5 who had been seated left when their order hadn't been taken within 15-20 minutes. With all the to'ing and fro'ing for our own meal it was 25minutes after we had been seated before our order was eventually taken. I don't think it would have been too much to ask to let us order from the regular a la carte menu. If needed a supplement could have been charged for the steak but all other courses were of very similar value. The hotel, apart from this complaint, was beautiful and the executive lounge and breakfast the following morning were very enjoyable. It was an excellent bonus feature to have had access to the sports channels in our room as with a young baby, the bar is not always the best environment in which to view a game.",4,2014,03,06
211,Amazing Value,"This hotel has so many extras; from strong wifi, to a great restaurant and very friendly staff. 

The hotel is a little out of the way from downtown, but has very spacious, clean and modern rooms. The gym facilities are also very good. We enjoyed that there wasn't an additional fee for everything (ie. wifi, gym access etc.). The breakfast is also very good.  The hotel also has an arrangement with a sightseeing tour to be picked up from the hotel, and brought to the city centre (otherwise a 15 minute walk).

This hotel is definitely a bargain, and I could recommend it to anyone.",4,2014,03,05
211,Very Good Experience,"Good efficient 'nice' service from Reception to Dining to Bar to Housekeeping - clean bedroom and bathroom! with all the facilities that you would expect in a high quality hotel. Location is about 10 min. walk from city centre. Make sure you check to see what is on in Croke Park during your stay - didn't disrupt our plans but its worth thinking about before you book. P.S. the Dublin Bike Hire was great to get around in the City Centre and the Docks. Overall - a really good hotel with lovely, helpful, cheerful staff.",5,2014,03,05
211,Best Hotel Experience,"My husband and I stayed in this hotel from 24th to 27th January for my birthday weekend.  From the moment we arrived the staff were exceptional.  We checked in with a very friendly gentleman, who remembered us throughout our stay and called us by our names.  He also arranaged very special treats as it was my birthday.  We stayed on the executive floor which served a very good continental breakfast with tea, coffee, fruit and treats throughout the day in the exclusive executive suite.  This was very comfortable and relaxing.  Our room was of a very high standard and a lot of space.  The bathrrom had a bath along with a large stand alone shower.  The staff had decorated the room with balloons and a banner for my birthday along complementary two bottles of prosecco.  Each night there was a turn down service with a lavender scented hottie placed in the bed and chocolates left beside the bed.  There was also slippers and dressing gowns provided and a paper each morning.  The concierge staff were very helpful in advising on the tour buses and local attractions.  We ate on the first night in the bar and had delicious burgers with chips in a great atmosphere.  On the final night rather than eating in town we decided to eat in the bistro, we both had steak and the meal was excellant.  When it came to paying for the meal we were advised our desserts were on the house as it was my birthday weekend.  All the staff went out of their way to be helpful and friendly.  Although the hotel is a good fifteen walk into the city, it is worth it for the quality of the experience and true Irish hospitality.  You can walk to the Drumcondra Road in five minutes and access frequent buses into the city.  We will definetely be back and highly recommend this hotel to others.",5,2014,03,05
211,Perfect!!,Room was large and clean. Stayed on the executive floor so the access to the executive lounge was lovely.  Hotel staff was super friendly and very accommodating. The lounge area is beautiful and the staff there were amazing as well. Will def stay again!!,5,2014,03,05
211,The staff here were amazing!!!!,"My friend and I were staying here our first night in Dublin.  The following morning, my friend became ill, and had to go to hospital.  Sean and the staff were so amazing during this time! They helped us get an ambulance, and offered me an additional night at the hotel while she was in hospital at no cost.  They were consistently checking in to see how I was faring, and made sure I was fed and comfortable.  Their genuine concern for our well-being was amazing.  We stayed again on our last night, and were equally accommodating and kind.  The rooms are beautiful and very comfortable, the morning buffet was delicious, and the staff absolutely amazing.  I would stay again in a heartbeat if I could get back to Ireland that quickly!",5,2014,03,04

211,Great location + comfy living,"Warm friendly reception and staff. Lovely sitting area in the foyer. Free underground car parking was important for us and very easy to find/drive to. (Dublin is very easy to navigate by car in general). Free fast wifi, even from level 4. And we paid a little extra to upgrade to a deluxe deal that included breakfast and access to a loungeroom that served free bottles of water and coffee/tea all day...definitely worth it! Breakfast was a lovely wide spread selection of cereals, breads, cold meats, cheeses, muesli, yoghurt and fresh fruit... So worth the stay we have booked again for the end of our trip around Ireland before flying out of Dublin again!",5,2014,03,02
211,Croke Park Hotel - Excellent service,"The service was great from the moment I walked in until the moment I left. The staff were very obliging and extremely helpful. The room was magnificent and so was all the services in the hotel. The executives lounge is an excellent feature, very impressive. The hotel is located in an ideal location for access to Croke Park and the surrounding areas. The only thing which didn't impress me was the food in the sideline bar, I ate there on two occasions. The first night my side order was burnt and cold, other than that the food and service was fine. The second night however I ordered the balti curry - it was a very small portion and was not that appatising.

Overall, I would recommend staying in the hotel however I don't think I would be returning for barfood in a hurry.",5,2014,02,28
211,Croke Park,"This is the 2nd time staying at this hotel and have to say it was again excellent,staff very helpful and friendly,hotel clean,bright,food excellent with good choice on the menu,Bedrooms are large,bright,modern and very well equipped.Well done and keep it up.",5,2014,02,28
211,A definite recommend!!,"Stayed for two nights and hotel was faultless. Big spacious room with big comfy bed. Cleanliness was to a very high standard. Bathroom was nice size with very nice shower. Hotel staff very pleasant and helpful. 

Would definitely recommend and would definitely stay again. Very close to O'connell street, about a 5 minute taxi drive, which has the hop on hop off tour bus, shops and restaurants. 

Restaurant has lovely selection of food and service was very quick. I would recommend including breakfast as was a very good selection of both hot and cold food and very tasty.

211,Great Experience,My husband and I stayed at this hotel our first night on our vacation to Ireland. The staff was very friendly and the concierge helped us out by giving us great recommendations on how to get around the city and where to eat!,5,2014,02,26
211,excellent overnight stay,My wife and I had a lovely stay at the Croke Park hotel.It's well worth a visit and the staff are most helpful and well trained.I would say that it's the best run hotel that i have stayed in and the management can be very proud of it.Well done and good luck with your business.,5,2014,02,26
211,Great Valentine's and Birthday Weekend,"We stayed at the hotel over Valentines and my birthday weekend. We travelled via bus from Dublin Airport which probably took about 40 mins (it was rush hour so longer than a usual journey)

We booked just a room as there was no breakfast option available. When we arrived at the hotel, we were greeted by a friendly receptionist who quickly found our reservation and suggested that we buy some discounted breakfast vouchers which we did.

The room was clean, spacious and modern. The bathroom had a separate bath and shower which I particularly liked. The room had all mod cons including flat screen TV, fridge and stereo.

We then went downstairs to the restaurant and enjoyed a lovely meal with great service & afterwards sat in the rather cosy bar for a few cocktails.

The bed was extremely comfortable and aside from our noisy neighbours I slept very well. I had to phone reception at 3am as our neighbours came in drunk and kept making loads of noise. As soon as the security guard visited, it all went quiet and I got back to sleep.

In the morning, we went for breakfast and were impressed by the choice available. There was plenty to go around and drinks were quick to be served. After breakfast, I chatted to the Manager about what happened the previous night and she apologised, explaining that they don't normally get noise complaints - I believe this is true as this hotel isn't the sort which attracts stags and hen parties, nor is it near to lots of bars.

We went out for the day travelling by bus to the city centre (which is about 15 mins away). When we got back I was really happy with what I found in our room - a couple of bottles of chilled prosecco with a note from the Manager wishing me a happy birthday. I didn't get a chance to say thanks to the Manager, so hopefully reading this she'll get the message!

Overall we had a great stay and I would recommend this place. It's a bit of a hidden gem, you definitely don't expect what you find and you won't be disappointed.",4,2014,02,25
211,Excellent value,"Spent 3 nights at the Croke Park Hotel, found it to be excellent value for money, good size rooms, filling breakfast with friendly and attentive staff. My only gripe was no plug socket near a mirror which for a woman is not great! Otherwise a great stay and would recommend to my friends and family.",5,2014,02,25
211,Nice clean hotel,This hotel was great for access to croke park. Just across the road. Ideal for anyone needing access to croke park. A little out of the way for city centre by foot though. Will def visit again if suitable.,4,2014,02,25
211,Fantastic Customer Service in Ireland,"I had the most wonderful experience recently when I stayed in this hotel. First off let me say that all the staff were fantastic. There was an efficient capable jolly manager, Sean, who made us feel very welcome when we asked him about room upgrades. Simply put, all the rooms are fantastic. What a guy.

As for the bar staff. One young lady in particular caught our attention. Shauna was her name. She had a smile the width of Dublin bay and went the extra mile in attending to our every need. What a great employee to have warm our hearts on a cold night in Dublin. Well done to all at the CPH.

Stan and Marlene",5,2014,02,24
211,Great Hotel Pick!,"We arrived in Dublin at a very weird time, but they let us check in well before we were supposed to and were extremely kind and helpful.  The continental breakfast was great, too.  It is about a 20 minute walk to the city centre, but it wasn't a problem for us.  They also offered us bottled water when we left, when came in very handy when we didn't realize how far we were from the next driving spot. 
      ",5,2014,02,23
211,Can't wait to go back,"I stayed here on 2 occasions with a weekend break between both stays.  I was offered a hot towel on arrival on both occasions.  I also used the car park which is so convenient & safe.  The location of the hotel is great & is easy to find.  Proximity to city centre is also good.  I used room service which was really efficient.  Love the supply of toiletries etc.  when I checked in for my second stay I got a free upgrade to executive level - THANK YOU SO MUCH.  Got my morning paper delivered to my room.  Food was good - only gripe I had was that I requested a poached egg at breakfast and I had to wait some time before it arrived. Breakfast was slightly disorganised that morning - quite a few young staff who didn't seem to be getting any direction.  Rooms I had were quiet and comfortable.  I really enjoyed my stay here and would have no hesitation in returning.  I have to compliment all the staff that I encountered, warm, friendly, courteous, welcoming & efficient.  A credit to the hotel.  Gives a really good professional appearance.  I will be back.",5,2014,02,22

211,Midterm Break,"Just back after two day shopping/concert trip. Great Location, within a 15 minute walk of city centre, very secure car park, park up and stroll into town, return taxi with all your shopping, €8 approx, Hotel spotless, excellent staff, Well equipped bedrooms, best bathrooms. Breakfast very good, good bar food, kids menu very reasonably priced. Very friendly, welcoming, enjoyable stay.",5,2014,02,21
211,Croke Park Hotel,"Good hotel and friendly staff.  Rooms spacious and well maintained. Down side, locality - a little far out from city, bars and resturants unless you used taxis. Walking was ok but a little too far walking both ways.  However, saying that we would stay there again.  Food was ok and reasonably priced if using 20% voucher - was disappointed to find out we could have gone for the half board option but was never offered this!!! The hotel should offer airport transport to improve their services.",4,2014,02,21
211,CROKE PARK,"Enjoyed a most relaxing and pleasant stay here as the facilities and staff are always of the highest standards.
We  received a very warm and informative welcome and from then onwards our stay was made comfortable and warm by all the staff.The room was all we could have hoped for ,whilst the actual location meant that we were within walking distance of many of the main tourist sites in Dublin
The meals were excellent and the staff were so attentive throughout especially the waiting staff in the dining room.The food was always freshly made and at breakfast time the items were replace dalmost continuously so that you never felt you were getting something that had been sitting for ages.
Overall I can  recommend this hotel highly as we have stayed there before and intend doing so again in the future",5,2014,02,21
211,Great for any visit!,"The staff was immediately and always welcoming. Everyone was amazingly friendly and willing to assist. Room service fast and tasty. Quick walk to Dublin area attractions and shops. The room was spacious and comfortable. There was a great view out the window. No noise pollution came through. Plenty of plugs and electrical outlets. Great shower! I'm sure during stadium games it gets busy but with no activity there and just a couple days in Dublin it was great. Safe as well. My wife and I walked back from Temple Bar area of Dublin very late one night. She commented she'd feel safe even doing that alone. The neighbourhood may not always look perfect but it is great. Also a big kph sis the self-service laundrette about a block or so away. Much of Ireland won't have what Americans are used to for self-serve laundry but this hotel has it close. An in-house service exists but a bit pricey per-item if your travelling light. Would stay again, easily.",5,2014,02,20
211,Lovely valentines get away,"Stayed here for 2 nights over valentines. Great hotel, after landing at 8am we worried we would not be able to check in so early, but it was no problem and a room was ready for us. Hot, scented flannels on arrival to refresh yourself was a lovely touch. We chose a room overlooking the courtyard as the croke park stadium isn't that nice to look at! Room was lovely and spacious and very clean. Big bed and bathroom was flawless (only problem was the plug didn't drain water away so had to completely take it out).  Bar downstairs was nice and reasonably priced. Take advantage of the breakfast offer as it's well worth it! Bit disappointed they didn't do tinned tomatoes but didn't go hungry. Friendly and helpful staff, hop on bus tour great to do and stops right outside the hotel. Town just a 15 minute walk away or a 5 minute bus ride away. Overall really enjoyed this hotel and would definitely come again! (Bottle of water on departure was also a nice touch)",5,2014,02,20
211,Fantastic One night get away,"Like loads of others looking reasonable hotel accomodation in dublin we checked a few prices and after some consultation we booked this hotel , primarily because we were familiar with the area and could easily access our planned activities by car from there. We were very pleasantly surprised on check in to be upgraded with complimentary use of the executive lounge which was brilliant. The facilities were excellent, the hotel was spotless ,staff especially courteous,top class bar food with excellent attentive staff , complimentary car parking. . We could not have asked for more and would have expected to pay more in loads of other ""trendy"" hotels. Well done to all who made our stay so enjoyable..  The Gormley family",5,2014,02,19
211,Great family stay,"We stayed as a family in the Croke Park Hotel. The room was on the 4th floor with access to the executive lounge which was worth it. Excellently appointed room, loads of space, enormous bathroom with separate shower and bath. The breakfast was to a good standard and we also ate in the bar which was lovely.",5,2014,02,19
211,Very friendly and welcoming,"Lovely friendly hotel, with helpful staff. I opted for the executive level room and for the extra 15 euros a night, well worth it. I received a hot hand towel on check in to freshen up and all the extra touches have made the stay. Being able to work in the quiet of e executive lounge has been great too. The immediate surrounding area isn't the nicest, but I'm sure further afield will make up for that. Great hotel at a very reasonable price.",4,2014,02,19
211,21st Birthday,The walk from the main street to the hotel is through quite a rough area however when you get to the hotel you will be very happy.  The rooms were beautiful and the food was yummy.  Staff were friendly and very helpful.,5,2014,02,18
211,great hotel,"Fantastic hotel, all amenities and staff were superb.  Check if anything is on at Croke Park stadium during your stay as it is literally over the road.  And be prepared for taxi fares from the city centre - while it is a reasonable walk into town you wouldn't want to walk back in the dark.  Lovely hotel though.",5,2014,02,18
211,Excellent hotel with great staff and service,We stayed at this hotel as my husband was lecturing at Croke Park Stadium. The hotel was excellent in my opinion.  The rooms were spacious and clean and the service from the staff was great.  The bar area was busy but not too loud and the location was also good. We were about ten mins from St Stephens in a cab. Would recommend this hotel. ,5,2014,02,18
211,Superb Valentines weekend  ,"We stayed Friday/Saturday night valentines weekend. Excellent service from start to finish. Would highly recommend. Location was ideal for us, we walked into the heart of Dublin in around 10mins. Room was very well equipt with a lovely king size bed. Excellent attentive staff. Couldn't fault it! ",5,2014,02,18
211,Good quality with nice Touches,"Our fourth trip to Dublin and the first time we have got the standard of hotel that we really want and expect to be honest. There were some really nice touches -Executive lounge with free hot drinks,water and newspapers. A spacious restaurant with good quality breakfast options. Above average spotless bathroom with excellent toiletries. Very comfortable Queen size bed with excellent bedding. Lastly the staff were all excellent and man for man (and woman) were all better than your normal city hotel. 
We visited for Valentines over a couple of days and as the weather was poor we ate in the hotel on the second night. A Free gift for all the ladies dining of a red rose was nice and the food was very good indeed. Oh and at breakfast you were seated with an optional free daily paper each....again all good
If there was a downside it is out of the centre BUT do not let this put you off. The trade off was no idiots, groups of stag or hens and nice and quiet. 
By the way it was a deal via Secret Escapes and it was a cracker but I would recommend this hotel in any event.

211,"fantastic customer service, wonderful hotel","Every member of staff here treats you like as family member and can't do enough for you. We were greated on arrival  by Catherine McKenna, the front office manager, and she exemplified the staff culture here. My wife says this is the best hotel she has stayed at. I can't disagree and you will see how many places I've visited. In particular the WiFi here is fantastic, 20 Mbit download and 10 Mbit upload. I thought my phone was broken when I uploaded my Facebook photos, it was so quick. I think we were upgraded as we had bath robes and an  iPhone hub in the room. Nice large bed and flast screen TV. 

After long days touring Dublin we tended to get a taxi back which was 8 Euros. Its about 15 mins walk into town. Hotel has free bikes. There is a round Dublin bike route at bottom of road, half of it completely off road.

Number 16 bus at airport leaves from stance 11 - you need exact change for driver and no notes are accepted. €2.60 is fare and I got off the stop after Quinns pub.",5,2014,02,17
211,Very nice hotel - suitable for both business and leisure trips,"Friendly and experienced staff at reception
Nice gym with business-friendly opening hours
Free WiFi access 
Little negative: only local TV channels, no international ones 
Walking distance to O'Connell Street approx. 20 mins, to Grafton Street 40 mins
      
      ",4,2014,02,17
211,Fantastic,"This hotel was amazing, everything about it was perfect. The staff were so friendly and this has been the cleanest hotel that I have ever stayed in. The only downside is the location it is one of the rougher parts of Dublin, but well worth staying here and paying for taxis as I don't think this hotel can be beaten.",5,2014,02,16
211,Good location at a good price ,"Stayed for four days over valentines with my fiancé. You can walk into town within 10 mins but if you get the hop on hop off bus which is valid for two days and cost us 36 euro, you can get one of these right outside the hotel in the morning and get dropped back off around 4.30pm. Taxi into town is around 7 euro if you don't want to walk at night. The tour buses are great for getting to every tour stop so we made great use of our 36 euro ticket. 
Friendly staff, clean, tidy rooms. Book in advance to get great deals. Breakfast is really good and has a lot of choice, we would definitely stay again :) ",4,2014,02,16
211,Ignore Reviews Whinging About Location,"After reading reviews regarding the hotel's location I was concerned that it might be slightly further from the city centre than we'd have liked. Luckily, this wasn't the case. 
My partner and I stayed at the Croke Park Hotel for 6 nights, and walked into the city centre and back every day we were there. Granted we are both fairly young (late 20s!) & in good health, but I would urge anyone in a similar situation not to worry. The 15 minute walk might be a stretch for young children or the elderly, but it certainly wasn't a problem for us. We even did it in the rain! The route was clearly described to us by one of the many friendly receiption staff and we never looked back. A local friend told us we'd need to take a bus - this was far from true. 

In regards to the hotel itself, rooms were spacious and clean, and the staff were brilliant. We had a superior room with access to the executive suite on the 4th floor and found this an excellent facility. We could stop in and grab a takeaway coffee before we left for another day of exploring. I'd thoroughly recommend this hotel. 

We're hoping to come back one day. If you have any concerns about location, there really is no need to worry! ",5,2014,02,16
211,A great location just a heartbeat away from Dublin Centre!,"Just spent a night in the Croke Park Hotel and one thing is certain- we will return!
Spacious and spotless rooms, welcoming and attentive staff who catered for our every need.
Our meals both at night and at breakfast were excellent, where the dining room staff were attentive but unobtrusive.
The hotel is close enough to walk to the city centre, although the weather necessitated a taxi where both journeys were accompanied by the wit of the Dublin taxi driver and the underground car park is a huge bonus for your stay!
Our first visit won't be our last! 
",5,2014,02,15
211,3 days in Dublin ,"Nice hotel, we flew in early and was a little worried we would not be able to check in after a 16 hour flight, but they were all set for our early check in.
Room is clean large for Dublin with a very nice bathroom. They have smoking rooms. 
We went with the bed and breakfast plan and it worked out wonderful, breakfast is the standard eggs, potatoes, mushrooms, tomatoes, sausage, bacon, black and white pudding. Hot and ready at 630 am.
The hotel is about a 30 min walk to central Dublin and the attractions but not a bad walk at all.
",4,2014,02,15
211,Great hotel but not great location,A really nice hotel particularly if attending a match or concert in Croke Park. The location is really not ideal if visiting the city and is a taxi ride from the city centre. Nice rooms and large bar area. A nice stay all the same.,4,2014,02,14
211,"Modern, quiet hotel.  Will return","Second time at the Croke Park.  Just as nice as the first time.  Had a room at the back of the hotel - no view to speak of, but quiet, quiet, quiet.  Great after a busy day in the city centre for the two of us to relax.  Easy to get the bus into town, or hop on the free shuttle for the open top bus trip - check with reception for the departure times.

Had a ""superior"" king-size room.  Clean, spacious, nice bathroom - good to be able to soak it up in the bath.  Or there's space to dance in the huge shower!   Full price would be a bit pricey, but there always seems to be offers on so keep your eyes open.  We stayed 3 nights for less than the price of 2.

Not much in the way of facilities nearby (some local shops, pubs, restaurants) but it's so close to the city centre and the buses so frequent that's not an issue, although it can take as long to walk to the bus stop as it takes the bus to get in to town.

We would happily come here again.",4,2014,02,13
211,Prize!,"My boyfriend won two nights B&B at the hotel along with an evening meal, for two, while he was at a Charity Night in a local bar last year. As it was his birthday on 8th February, he booked it for that weekend. We arrived to a beautiful comfy room with two little bottles of prosecco and banner and balloons for his birthday in the room. The bed was huge and the comfiest Ive slept in ever. The bathroom was fab, enjoyed a hot bubble bath twice over the weekend. Was able to avail of free wifi which seemed to have a pretty good connection. The Executive Lounge was also made available to us on our floor - here we were allowed free tea, coffee, water and fruit. The three course meal in the restaurant that night which was part of our prize was delicious! My boyfriend claimed the steak fillet was the nicest steak he's ever had! One waiter we had was very attentive and we had a good laugh with him. Tall thin guy with darkish hair. Raging I cant remember his name, he deserves a special mention! We had a few drinks in the bar after this. The bar staff were also so friendly and helpful, one bar girl to the point that after spling the tiniest dribble from my Cosmo, she made me a fresh one for free! There was no need at all! Breakfast was great the next morning too, buffet but great selection and piping hot! Really enjoyed our stay at the hotel - we were sad to be leaving at the end! ",5,2014,02,12
211,Great stay in Dublin,"This hotel is definitely 4 stars quality. We had a very pleasant stay here. The rooms are very comfortable and the matress is to die for. The room was very clean with daily service and in-room team and coffee service. This hotel also goes beyond with the nicest  little attentions like chocolate in the evening.
On the minus side, the breakfast while ok could definitely be improved with more delicatessen. But overall a very nice experience. I'd stay here next time I'm in Dublin.",4,2014,02,12
211,Croke Park Hotel,Great place to stay! I highly recommend this hotel. This hotel is about a 20 minute walk to the Dublin downtown for some great shopping. If not you can buy a 2 day ticket on the hop on hop off tour bus for about 17 euros. While it picks you up at the hotel it will not drop you back off at the hotel. But close enough for a short walk back. Make sure you pick up a map of the bus stops before you go. Nice large rooms with a great buffet for breakfast and the daily paper.,5,2014,02,11
211,Very good deal!,"If I'm honest we can't really complain - for a girly weekend away we got an amazing deal for two rooms for three nights which included a tour of the Guinness storehouse (well worth a try!), 20% of their bistro (fairly expensive but the discount makes it reasonable for the quality), a free cocktail each as well as two free taxi journeys to a destination of your choice! The extras just kept coming! The rooms are a good size and most importantly clean, the view isn't great opposite the stadium, but we were not here for the views! Only downside is the distance from the centre - I'd say a good 20-25 minute walk, but really we couldn't fault the hotel, lovely helpful staff, especially Jessica in front of house who gave us lots of great recommendations for where to visit! Thanks for having us :-)",4,2014,02,11
211,Great value wonderful facilities,Stayed 3 nights prior to a wedding - great value wonderful staff high quality hotel - couldn't complain about anything.  It was about 20 - 25 minute walk into the centre which was longer than we thought but not a major issue.  Breakfast was fantastic!,5,2014,02,11
211,Croke Park Hotel,"First time to Dublin and stayed at The Croke Park Hotel and it was faultless. It was clean, the rooms are spacious, staff are friendly and the breakfast is fantastic. Its not to far to walk into central Dublin so the location is good also. Would highly recommend for any occasion. 
Didn't use the pool or spa.",5,2014,02,11
211,First class from the moment we arrived.......,"Traveling with my dad for a 'lads' trip to watch the rugby, we arrived around 10am and asked if it was ok to leave our car and luggage and were pleasantly surprised at being allowed to check in straight way. Having booked through a third party website, we had not prepaid for breakfast and were assured by the receptionist that theirs was the 'best in Dublin' and offered vouchers at €10 each instead of €14.95 if we charged them to our room daily. Needless to say, we took up this offer, and bought vouchers for our 4 nights stay.
When we got to our room, it was well presented and clean with 2 double beds as ordered and all other facilities you would expect from a highly rated hotel. The only thing that proved a disappointment was the shower, which lacked water pressure and was more like drizzle than a shower!
As we were in Dublin, next stop was the bar which was well attended by very friendly staff and we had a couple of Guinness and a sandwich each which were all superb. 
At breakfast next morning, we were glad we had taken the advice given, as the variety and quality of food on offer was excellent, and at €10 each, good value as well. The cooked buffet was enough to keep you full all day so saved us buying lunch for the rest of our stay.
We had an evening meal in the restaurant twice during our stay, and again the food did not disappoint, offering good value for money.
Staying at this hotel also helped us save money on other activities, like visiting the GAA stadium at Croke Park and purchasing discounted tickets for the city tour bus from reception.
I would recommend this hotel to anyone visiting Dublin for whatever purpose as it really does cater for everyone.",5,2014,02,11
211,Fantastic!,"Fantastic hotel… where to start… the staff are all so friendly and wonderfully helpful. The room was spacious, modern and sooo comfortable. Perfect position for walking in to town or further afield. The facilities are top notch, seriously, stay and you won’t be disappointed!",5,2014,02,11
211,A really good hotel,I was surprised at how good this hotel was. Rooms very good - I was a bit cold due to the light quilt but housekeeping provided another one. Waitresses in the bar for evening meals were excellent - friendly and efficient Irish girls who seemed to enjoy their work and were concerned for the customers. Nothing was a problem to the reception staff and a bottle of water on check out was a nice touch.,5,2014,02,10
211,Great Place to Stay,"I stayed at this hotel for two nights in February 2014 with my wife.
We had a deluxe room which was situated on the fourth floor, which boasted an executive lounge with free tea, coffee, biscuits, fruit, water, fruit juice and a comfortable sitting area away from the busy foyer and other ground floor sitting areas.
Our flight had got us to Dublin by 09.00 and we took a chance that the hotel would have a room free for a very early check in. The reception staff were very helpful and allocated us our room immediately so we were able to unpack and freshen up before hitting the town!! The room was spacious, nicely furnished and well decorated. The bathroom had bath and shower and lots of shelf space.
We had a full Irish breakfast each morning in the Sideline Bistro and it was very good, hot and freshly cooked with plenty of choice for hot and cold food. It was nearly 15 euros each but good value.
One evening we had our evening meal in the hotel and this was very good and nicely served but again a little on the pricey side for a bar meal, but with a 20% discount voucher given to us by the hotel at check in it made it more reasonable.
So overall it was a very nice stay in a very good hotel with very helpful and pleasant staff.
The hotel is opposite Croke Park Stadium the home of Gaelic Football and Hurling and that dominates the area. This is a positive though as one of the best things we did during our short stay was to go on a tour of the stadium.
However, you should note that it is a good 15-20 minute walk from the hotel to the top of O'Connell Street and perhaps 30 minutes to Temple Bar. There are no bus stops near the hotel, the nearest we found was 7 - 10 minutes walk. This is no problem if the weather is good but with the weather that we encountered we had to resort to taxis on a few occasions.
An open top tour bus also stops outside the hotel and I believe that the hotel do provide a limited courtesy bus service into the centre in the morning but we didn't use that.
All together this hotel is recommended.",4,2014,02,10
211,You know what you are getting,"It is not boutique or flashy but for this type hotel you get the absolute best it could possibly be, the staff are lovely, knowledgeable and there are plenty of them. The bedrooms are clean and well appointed, the bathroom spacious. I was expecting something much more run of the mill but It exceeded that expectation by a long way. Thank you.",5,2014,02,10
211,Night at Croke Park,I stayed here for one night recently and could not have asked for a better service.  From the minute we walked in the door to the minute we left.  The staff were fabulous.  The room lovely and a bathroom so clean I did not at first realise there was a glass door on the shower it was so clean.  I had a great stay and was treated wonderfully.  Would reccommend this hotel to anyone.,5,2014,02,10
211,Yet again another fantastic stay at the Croke Park Hotel,"A big thank you Sean Reid and Catherine McKenna for organising our trip to the hotel for our Rugby weekend, this is my 3rd visit to the hotel and it never fails to impress, all the staff are so friendly, fantastic rooms and room service, I really cant praise this Hotel enough, all the staff are brilliant cant do enough for you, always smiling and so helpful.
The staff are a credit to the Hotel and the food and hospitality is second to none, I have stayed in number of Hotels over the years but nothing compared to Croke Park.

Cant wait to visit the Hotel again for our usual Rugby trip in 2 years time, we wouldn't dream of staying any where else. Martin Halliwell and the Rugby gang from Wrexham North Wales",5,2014,02,10
211,Perfect stay.,"Have just returned from Dublin today after a two night stay at this lovely hotel. We were greeted warmly and were very impressed with everything the hotel had to offer. Our room was clean, spacious and well equipped. The car park was very convenient, a lift from the lobby down to it. We ate at the hotel on both nights in the evening and the food was lovely. We were not disturbed by noise during the night. My Father is disabled and we booked a room which was fabulous for him, with a wet room shower and a push button opening door (from the inside)....very impressive.  15 min walk to the city, we hailed a taxi which could take an electric wheelchair to take us back to the hotel. I wouldn't hesitate to stay at this hotel again.",5,2014,02,09
211,Lovely,"Stayed here last night and was very impressed. Was welcomed at reception by Teresa from Donegal who was really helpful and kindly upgraded us to an executive room. She had a lovely friendly, natural manner! The room was beautiful - clean, comfortable bed, spotless bathroom, an iPod Dock and big TV with loads of channels. We also had access to the Executive Lounge on the 4th floor because of our upgrade and enjoyed complimentary tea, coffee, fruit, newspapers and magazines in front of a fire. Breakfast in the morning was perfect - food fresh and local. Check out was easy, parking free as we were residents. Thank you for a lovely stay - we will be back! ",5,2014,02,07
211,Great hotel,"We were more than satisfied with our stay at the Croke Park Hotel. The room was spacious, well equipped, clean and comfortable. The room was serviced daily with fresh towels and clean linen whenever requested, The staff were all very friendly, courteous and helpful.We bought breakfast vouchers for our stay and we were impressed with the variety of food on offer and the service.",5,2014,02,06
211,A real welcome,"Lived up to its rating, with the most helpful, nicest, friendliest but professional staff throughout the hotel. A travel club offer that really ticked all the boxes for value and star rating
    The ambiance was excellent, a good mix of clients, couples, business  and families as well as locals in the bar in the evening. Food was worth staying in for and after touring the city, and the bay both days it was great to eat in and relax. Well worth it.",5,2014,02,06
211,Modern Hotel,Very clean and comfortable hotel with excellent service. My husband and daughter were ill upon arrival and spent 3 days ordering room service. Unfortunately we didn't get to venture out but this would be a great spot for events across the road at the stadium. Very comfortable room and free wifi & parking! Will be back ,5,2014,02,06
211,Pleasant surprise,"This hotel is literally across the street from the Croke Park Stadium, so the location is great if you're attending a game or concert.  The hotel was great and has a large bar/lounge area with a huge TV screen.  The rooms were comfortable and we were able to walk back from restaurants, etc.",4,2014,02,05
211,Excellent,"Just completed 3 nights at the Croke Park, lovely large rooms, wonderfully cleaned and amazing service from all the staff, nothing is ever to much for them.
The food in the bar is great and wonderful place to meet business colleagues for a quick meal and meeting.
Will most definitely stay here when next in Dublin",5,2014,02,05
211,Lovely hotel!,"Just returned from a 2 night stay with my boyfriend and I cant recommend this hotel enough. We arrived very early (8am) and just expected to leave our bags as check in wasn't until 2pm but they had a room ready for us and hot towels to warm us up! The rooms are a great size with everything you could need, bathrooms are large and modern with a separate bath and shower. We didnt have breakfast included so I cant comment on the food. The concierge was extremely helpful in giving us information about getting around and we bought the hop on hop off tickets from the hotel at a reduced rate. These are valid for 2days so its great value for money. There is a free shuttle bus which goes from the hotel into the city but to use this you have to purchase the hop on hop off tickets. We walked both into and from the city in about 20 minutes on a couple of occasions and didnt find the area a problem as some people have said in their reviews. If I visit Dublin again which I hope I do then I will definitely be booking this hotel for my stay! ",5,2014,02,03
211,Great stay,"I spent two nights here for business.  My company chose the hotel, and I was not thrilled with the location when I looked on a map.  However, the hotel completely won me over.  It was so comfortable, and the staff was so kind.   I slept great.  The room was large, and bathroom modern (and enormous by European standards).  The breakfast was fabulous;  it is so generous that it can be breakfast and lunch.  I ate dinner two nights in the bar as I didn't want to go back out in the windy rain, and both meals were very reasonable and very good (fish & chips one night and butternut squash soup with sandwich the other).  You can walk into town in about 15 minutes - there is probably a bus, but I chose walking to help with my jet-lag.  I had two tiny problems which the hotel addressed in under 2 minutes on both occasions.  It's right across the street from a gigantic stadium, so beware of that.  I would wholeheartedly recommend this hotel to anyone, except maybe if there is something happening at the stadium.",5,2014,02,01
211,Great hotel in Dublin,"This hotel was beautiful and had lovely rooms.  The parking garage was easy to access, and it was not a long walk to the city centre.  The breakfast was excellent, and featured a variety of wonderful food choices, and left you feeling very full.  The concierge was extremely helpful in suggesting tours, times to visit places, and simply getting around. I would highly recommend the hop on hop off bus tour as a way to view the city.  As mentioned before, the walk from the hotel was not long to the city centre--maybe 15 minutes, and it was a great way to see the city.  This was booked as part of a deal, so I'm not sure how it would rate in terms of quality for the price, but the deal we got was great, and the hotel exceeded my standards.",5,2014,01,30
211,Nice hotel!,"A lovely hotel booked for my husband's birthday. Great sized rooms but I'd recommend not starting on the third floor as the corridor stunk of cigarette smoke. I'm guessing that the majority of rooms on this floor are smoking.
Recommend taking the Dublin city bus tour, Guinness storehouse and the chicken wings at elephant and castle, a short taxi ride away.",4,2014,01,29
211,Fantastic hotel,"Stayed here for a long weekend with my girlfriend. We arrived very early (around 8am) and didn't expect to be able to check in till 2pm as usual however they were able to accommodate us straight away. This friendly helpful service continued throughout our stay. The rooms are modern, spacious and above what I would expect for the price I paid. Dublin centre (I.e temple bar) was only a 20 min walk from the hotel and the airport 15 mins in a taxi. Great location, great hotel. Would recommend and will definitely stay again. ",5,2014,01,27
211,Return visit - standards remain very high,"I had a 3 night stay recently while doing a course across the road.  I had stayed there 2 or 3 times previously.  It lived up to my expectations with excellent, friendly, attentive service in the restaurant, bar, reception and bedroom.
The (standard) room was quite spacious and comfortable, though the lighting over the bed is quite poor, especially for reading or trying to do some close work. Plenty of other lights.
I had breakfast each morning and both the food and the service was excellent.  All the food was tasty, in particular both the black and white pudding, unusual for a hotel.
Parking was plentiful, though some of the spaces are tight.
However, a wake-up call on one of the mornings did not arrive, there was an obvious difference in the response of the call taker when I requested it, compared to the other two nights, and I wasn't surprised that it did not happen.
Only other negative was a breakfast tray (not mine), left in the corridor all day long.
Overall though I would highly recommend this hotel, it is only a 10-15 minute walk to the city centre, though this might not be advisable at night.  No trouble getting a taxi, the bus stop and train stop is about a 5 minutes walk.",5,2014,01,27
211,Excellent value!,"Stayed here in December 2013 for two nights. Great hotel with lovely staff, beautiful food and good-sized room. Our standard room had a double and single bed, safe, TV, and tea/coffee making facilities. There is also a free ice/water machine on each floor The bathroom had separate shower, bath and hand basin with plenty of toiletries and hot water! The underground car parking gives peace of mind and is free. We got a great deal on a b & b rate through Travel Republic. Would definitely stay again!",5,2014,01,27
211,Great Stay at The Croke Park,"The Croke Park is an outstanding hotel. I don't give it five stars because the location is not great; it's in front of a stadium so it's pretty dark. The property itself feels 5-star: amazing service, large room with great amenities and extremely confortable king-size bed. On site complimentary parking was very convenient. I highly recommend this hotel if you don't mind being a 10 minute drive from the city centre. ",4,2014,01,27
211,2 days in Dublin,"Stayed here last week for a two day visit.  The hotel was great and the staff was so nice.  Very welcoming, let me check in early.  The room was great.  Nice shower with lots of hot water.  My experience was so enjoyable.  Just a 15 minute walk to town, very easy.  Would definitely stay again  Thanks for the wonderful visit",5,2014,01,27
211,Goes the extra mile,"My wife and I have just returned from another wonderful stay at The Croke Park Hotel.As with all my previous visits I found the facilities and staff of this hotel to be one of the best there is.Yes, it is a little out of the centre but its other attributes far outweigh this.Parking on site is free and secure and a taxi to the centre is only about 8 euros ,much less than the exorbitant charges for parking in central hotels.The bedrooms are excellent,larger than average with very comfortable beds.The bathroom has a separate bath and shower and top quality towelling and toiletries.Breakfast is buffet style with a large selection of hot and cold dishes.The lounge bars are comfortably furnished and the bar staff are friendly and attentive.Reception is always well staffed and will go the extra mile to ensure your stay is the best possible.Cleanlines in all areas of the hotel is great and there is free wi-fi.Rates for the rooms. are very competitive.Certainly deserves all the good comments posted on Trip Advisor.",5,2014,01,27
211,Perfect,"Fantastic Hotel at a great price. Have stayed in the Croke Park Hotel numerous times and they have yet to disappoint. Best breakfast choice I have ever experienced and a lovely beautiful, comfortable, spacious room. Only a 15 minute walk from O’Connell Street. I love this hotel.",5,2014,01,27
211,Weekend Visit,"Spent 2 nights at the Croke Park on the 24th Dec 2014. Modern hotel with all the amenities you expect from a new build 4 star hotel. Caught the Aircoach to Druncondra station, hotel only a 5 min walk from the stop. We arrived early in the morning, staff very helpfull and friendly. Concierge took our bags and gave us a map of Dublin explaining the way to walk in to the centre. Hotel is about a 10 min brisk walk to O'connell street and a further 10 min to Temple Bar. Not a problem for us as we enjoy walking, if you want a hotel closer you either pay a lot more money or have to go for a 2 or 3 star b&b. After a full day in Dublin returned to the hotel and were given a superior double room on the 4th floor. Room large and airy with mini bar free water and coffee. We also had a continental breakfast which is self service on the 4th floor in the executive lounge. Goog value and a nice selection. Did not eat in the Restaurant as we prefer to eat in the city we are staying in, however selection looked ok. Overal a good hotel and very good value for the standard of room and service.",4,2014,01,27
211,Wedding stay surprise !!,"My wife n I booked croke park hotel 30th December 2013 to stay one night before flying out in the morning from Dublin on r honeymoon.  We booked a standard double room and upon arrival at the check in desk the nice lady at reception gave us a hot towel to freshin up which was a nice little touch after a long journey. 
When checking in the girl congratulated us for becoming man n wife and told us we had been upgraded free of charge to executive floor Liam suite ! 
This was a great surprise and the suite was fabulous. . Half an hour after getting the suite the door knocked and there was a free bottle of wine and a congratulations card ! 
The service and the treatment u get in this hotel is 2nd to none and they made r short stay here a memorable one !
Later that evening we went for a meal in the restaurant downstairs , we both had steaks which were perfectly cooked and super tasty ! In fact all the courses were beautiful and the breakfast the next morning was also superb.
There actually wasn't a negative thing to say we absolutely loved this hotel n hope to come back n stay again soon !
Huge thanx to the hotel manager n staff for such a memorable stay ..

211,croke park hotel,booked a last minute deal with wife to Dublin and picked thishotel based on reviews. i must say that the hotel was a great deal better than some of the reviews. the hotel was clean the food and staff were first class. i would advise people to try the italian just up the road as the food was cheaper but of the same high quality. the only downside to the hotel is the location with it being a bit further out from the city centre. i am planning to stay there again when wales play ireland in the rugby,5,2014,01,25
211,Lovely hotel,Stayed here on a visit to Dublin. Although about a 15 minute walk from the centre this hotel was superb. Staff when booking in we're pleasant friendly and helpful. Made you feel wanted as a customer and this carried on throughout our stay in all areas of the hotel. Room was beautiful. Food was excellent. Cannot faul it. Will definitely stay here again.,5,2014,01,24
211,Croke Park Hotel,"This hotel exceeded all my expectations. We were a group of 10, with two children aged 9 and 10, the rest of the group were in their 30's and my parents in their 60's. It was a family weekend break celebrating the children’s birthday, which the children were quick to inform the staff of. When the children got to their rooms, there were two teddies and a birthday card on their beds. Impressive. The kids were ecstatic. We had dinner in the hotel on the Friday night and it was reasonably priced and yummy, I was just disappointed I hadn't gone with the Scampi! The rooms were lovely and spacious, with super comfortable beds – Kind Coil beds – simple luxury -  lovely spacious bathroom with a powerful shower. We couldn't hear any other noise from other rooms, so a nice peaceful sleep for us all. We went touring Dublin on Saturday, the hotel staff booked us cabs, which arrived promptly (cost about €12/15 to get to town).We decided to leave the car in the free car park all weekend. Some of the party went out on the Saturday night and arrived home around 3am and the gentleman on duty on our return was just as happy and helpful as any of the other staff during the day. On our departure, the lady on the desk offered us all a bottle of water for our journey, another nice touch.  I don’t think I could rate this hotel any higher. They made our trip easy and so very enjoyable. The children rated the whole hotel experience 1000 out of 1000 (their words)",5,2014,01,23
211,croker scores with us !,"loved this hotel,  only stayed overnight but from the hot towels at reception on arrival, to the comfortable rooms and fantastic food ( and drinks !), we thoroughly enjoyed our stay and will be back again for definite. Bit of a walk into city centre and not a walk you would enjoy at nighttime so my advice would be to ramble into town, enjoy the craic in city centre, and hop into a taxi for the trip back to the hotel !",4,2014,01,23
211,First Class,"A great hotel from the smile you get on arrival to welcome you it just keeps getting better the food was great , the room was big as was the bathroom had all you could want and more breakfast was good , staff could not do enough for you this is a hotel we will be back to a hidden gem . thanks to all there",5,2014,01,22
211,3days in dublin,"The hotel was just as your other reviewers said
The rooms were excellent,staff first class and the food available was to a high standard
It's position is somewhat further than the 10minute walk described nearer 25 minutes to central Dublin. Perhaps a hotel shuttle us would be a good idea
Thoroughly enjoyed our stay",5,2014,01,20
211,Our Stay at the Croke Park Hotel,"Everything about the hotel was great. The room was perfect, the food was great in the morning. Parking at the -1 floor was pure and simple, going to the 0 floor was easy and check-in was quick and easy, and shortly we were enjoying our room, for two (2) nights in Dublin. Forget about driving and parking in Dublin, take taxi or some form of public transportation, if and when needed",5,2014,01,20
211,Fantastic,"Just returned home after a fabulous 2 night stay. This was our first time in Dublin and wow,what a fantastic hotel. Staff could not do enough for you. We stayed on the 4 floor with access to the executive lounge which was a lovely addition, complimentary refreshments and a nice area to chill. Rooms were very clean and very comfortable. We asked reception to recommend somewhere to eat on the first evening, they not only recommended a fab Italian (Luigi Malones) but called to book and arranged cabs. We loved it so much that we returned on the second evening. I can not fault the hotel and we will be returning.",5,2014,01,20
211,Comfortable First Stop,"Our first stop after traveling over 24 hours straight from Hawaii to Dublin. Comfortable room helped a bit with jet lag. Easy to get to and convenient for US drivers getting acclimated. Condition of hallway - carpeting, walls, etc. was a little tired. I imagine sports fans give this place heavy use because of its location.",4,2014,01,20
211,Best Hotel in Dublin,"I've stayed over 200 times here and wouldn't even consider any other hotel in Dublin. Facilities are excellent if you don't need a pool but the staff are what make your stay so wonderful. Great value for monet for a quality hotel 10 minutes walk from the city centre. Stay once and you're guaranteed to return!! Sandra Balcere in the bar is the nicest waitress you will ever meet, especially if you have children with you. ",5,2014,01,19
211,Enjoyable stay in Croke Park Hotel,"Travelled to Dublin for first time & chose to stay at Croke park Hotel, our room was very clean & bed was firm but comfortable. Plenty of other guests in hotel but no noise through night. We enjoyed the variety of food available on the Irish breakfast the next morning, before heading out into the city. We could've got taxis but chose to walk to see the area & it took 20 mins using very good directions from helpful staff. We had great time in Dublin & would stay at Croke park again!",4,2014,01,19
211,First class hotel,"We stayed for 2 nights on a mid week break and consider the hotel to be one of the best we have stayed in. We arrived at 9.30am (Buses 16 or 41 from the airport cost 2.50 euros each and dropped us 5/10 mins away from the hotel) and were allowed immediate access to our very well appointed bedroom. We had been upgraded to an executive room on floor 4, so were able to take advantage of the continental breakfast which is served daily in the executive lounge if you prefer an alternative to eating in the restaurant downstairs. Once breakfast has been cleared away, fresh fruit, home made biscuits, bottled water, fruit juice and a variety of hot drinks are still available in this lounge all day.
The breakfasts served in the main restaurant were self service with a good variety of cereals, fresh fruit, juices, and hot food. The quality of the produce was very high (apart from the sausages if I'm being honest) and the setting was also good. We did not eat at night in the hotel as we wanted to experience the Dublin night life. On the first night we ended up at the Italian 2 mins away form the hotel (Wallace Asti) mainly because it was raining. I would highly recommend this establishment too (see separate review for further details). On the second night we ventured into Dublin and (unlike previous reviewers) felt quite safe walking back late at night. Although the hotel was situated a little out of the way, it only took 10/15 mins to walk in to the city centre (although anyone with mobility problems might struggle) and the exercise helped to minimise our weight gain from overindulging in food and drink!. All in all a very enjoyable stay.",5,2014,01,18
211,NIGHT AWAY,"Great Hotel , Lovely Rooms And Great Staff . Love The Tv Sports . The Bar Food Was Great. Fish & Chips The Best We Had In A Long Time . The Staff Were Very Friendly And Made Us Feel Welcome. We Will Be Back
      ",5,2014,01,18
211,Fantastic,"Stayed here for the compromised rules in October 2013, excellent hotel. Room was more than spacious, bathroom was giant. Bed was massive and really comfortable. The rooms and hotel are very modern.

The hotel is as lively as you will get on match days, great atmosphere and crowd. 

Grafton street and other tourist hot spots are a bit of a walk, 10(Euro) in a taxi took us to most places.

Bar area is modern and has plenty of room for a crowd, typical hotel prices which are the same everywhere in Dublin.

Breakfast was excellent, great selection and taste. 

Thoroughly enjoyed the stay and will be back for a few games. Well worth a visit.",5,2014,01,17
211,A very comfortable hotel,"We spent some nights at this nice hotel. The location is perfect and very close to the city centre (also walking). Staff was friendly, efficient, patient and helpful and make us feel home. Our room was very clean and comfortable. Hope to come back soon!!!",5,2014,01,16
211,A few bright spots,"We stayed here our first two nights in Dublin as part of a week's stay given to us by our children.  The hotel is quite a distance from Dublin's center...so even though we had a car, we traveled in and back by taxi....Our room had two beds...which we thought strange for a couple but the best part of the room was the beautiful and spacious bathroom. The beds were OK, but not hotel quality. The highlight of our stay was the first person we met at the front desk upon arrival:  Ian.  He was friendly, courteous and generous of spirit at all times...our first impression of the Irish people for two very tired travelers.  Unfortunately he doesn't work around the clock...The afternoon staffing the front desk (Sinead and the brunette with glasses) were mostly indifferent.  Their attitude was dismissive and their help non existent.  Only when we asked Sinead for her name did she even give us a bit of attention....they talked mostly to each other and while we waited for our Taxi, I noticed they were the same to everyone even on the phone.  The consierge was not helpful at all....Ian gave us all the help.  The women working in the restaurant at breakfast were wonderful....the breakfast was good, opt for the fried eggs as the scrambled are from a carton...the coffee, tea and juices were watered down.  the best was the decaf...desserts in the lounge at the end of the day with cappuccino were great.",4,2014,01,15
211,IMMACULATE,"Access:- By bus from Dublin Airport it was just 20 minutes by Bus No. 16. Fare Euro 2.6 to Drumcondra. Got down opposite Quinn's Pub and it was a 5 minutes walk to the Croke Park Hotel  located opposite the Croke Park Stadium.
The Hotel:- Check in was swift, front office staff, concierge were courteous & friendly. The Reception was cosy and well furnished/maintained.
The Room: To our utter astonishment the Room was very well furnished/immaculately maintained. Spacious Room with a Single & a Queen Bed. 
The Bathroom itself was very spacious, clean, shining floor and wall tiles & shining sanitary ware as if new.
Restaurant: Good Bar, decent sitting, friendly staff, good food, reasonably priced.
I am happy I found a very good Hotel with 5 star facilities at a very reasonable price.
Will definitely recommend and stay whenever visit Dublin Next.
If you want to eat out side, there is an Italian Restaurant ""Wallace"" within a minutes walk and Savoy Talk Away within 5 minutes walk.
Try Fagans Pub a 8 minutes walk from the Hotel in Drumcondra. Great ambience, good food and Tap House. See my separate review for Fagans Pub.",4,2014,01,15
211,Great Stay,"We stayed here for one night in January, we got the winter escape which included an upgrade to the executive room, the room itself was small for an executive room but the executive lounge was excellent. There was plenty of fresh fruit, water, coffee etc. Breakfast was served in the lounge the next morning and I can't fault it. We have stayed in other so called four star hotels and have had a worst breakfast in the restaurant than here in the executive lounge. Overall, our stay was excellent and can't fault it. ",4,2014,01,14
211,superb service,Staying at the Croke Park Hotel is an absolute joy from the moment of arrival to departure. ALL the staff are committed to ensuring that your stay is memorable for all the right reasons and each time you stay leaves you looking forward to your next visit. The environment is warm and welcoming. The staff clearly work hard to ensure guest comfort and having stayed many times my experience has been that each guest is valued and well looked after.,5,2014,01,14
211,Well done,"I have staved in the Croke Park Hotel on numerous occasions and it continues to provide an excellent service. It is the one hotel in Dublin that really works for me. I love the breakfast set up.   I have never been disappointed with the accommodation, food,  services and facilities offered, to date. Well done to all involved. I look forward to my next visit. ",5,2014,01,14
211,Croke Park - a hotel with a huge heart,"My girlfriend and I stayed here for one night over the New Year period to celebrate my girlfriends birthday. From the moment we arrived we were impressed with the warmth of this wonderful hotel. We were greeted by a friendly concierge with hot chocolate, which was most welcome on what was a bitterly cold winters night. After informing the hotel that it was my girlfriends birthday, the hotel staff were thoughtful enough to wish her happy birthday upon arrival, write her a card, and ensure that the hotel experience was one to remember. And this despite it being arguably their busiest period of the year. The breakfast was delicious, with ample choice. The rooms were spacious, modern and warm with one of the most comfortable beds I've ever slept in. The staff were consistently friendly and helpful throughout. Thank you Croke Park for making our stay so memorable and enjoyable. You went above and beyond to ensure that we had the perfect start to our time in Ireland. We will definitely be returning to Croke Park.",5,2014,01,14
211,gaa,"lovely bar food. great music. very comfortable. safe and reliable car park.. bedrooms are top top quality .. with the desk /bench providing great space for work to be done.. great variety of channels on the tv .. and the cd player was an absolutely class touch. great sound quality out of them... I really appreciated the cd player and brought some cds up from the car.. overall, top quality hotel.",5,2014,01,13
211,"Nice hotel! Great food, super comfy beds","We stayed there for New Years eve and ate in the bar the food and the service were so good we decided to spend the whole night there. They had live music and a large screen showing all the countdowns all over the world.   The breakfast in the morning was awesome but a little pricey.  The rooms were large and the beds were the most comfortable we have slept in, in Europe.",5,2014,01,13
211,Fair and Reasonable,"Hotel was a fair and reasonable place.  15-20 minute walk to the spire on O'Connell and 25-30 minutes to Temple Bar area.  If touring, would recommend the two day stop and hop green buses......do not use the red stop and hop buses.....everyone was complaining about the red bus company as they do not have near as many buses and stops are more infrequent.",4,2014,01,13
211,Amazing Hotel!!,"From we arrived at the hotel until we left, I have to say everything was exceptional. The friendliness and helpfulness of the staff, the facilities and the food were all 110%. We will defiantly be back :)",5,2014,01,13
211,Great stay,"I stayed with in this hotel for one night on a overnight conference trip. Evertything from check-in to check-out was great. Lovely comfy room. Only problem was my early start, wouldv'e loved to have chilled out in the room a bit longer, but hey there is always next time!",5,2014,01,13
211,"Location wasn't great, comfortable stay, staff mediocre","If you're use to walking, then I would consider it an ok location for being close to the city centre. I am use to walking most places, but I could see how it might be a pain for those who aren't use to cruising around with your lambo-feeties. The breakfast was decent, but I was not impressed with the staff. Except for a few... but for the most part, they are uninterested in making your stay one that will increase reason for a return visit. The rooms are nice... comfortable with all the bells and whistles you expect for a decent hotel room. Nice shower and tub.",3,2014,01,13
211,Great hotel but not for tourists,"This hotel is not ideal for tourists because it is a 2 mile walk to the south side of the river (where all of the touristy places are - ie Guiness Storehouse, Temple Bar, museums, etc.).  My guidebook described the neighborhood that we were in as lower income and somewhere the average tourist would have no reason to go to - agreed.  That being said the hotel itself is very pleasant.",4,2014,01,12
211,Great Hotel,"Stayed at the Hotel for 2 nights in January. Excellent location for city centre about a 20 minute walk. Staff very accommodating allowing an early check in and when there were no tables free for a bar meal the staff produced one, set it up and made me feel really welcome. Visit Croke Park for a insight into the history of this amazing country.   ",5,2014,01,12
211,Still a great place,This is still a great place. Rooms very comfortable and clean. You will get a great nights sleep in these beds. Very clean and modern bathroom. The staff are very friendly. I didn't have any food this time. Would return again,5,2014,01,12
211,Great hotel!,"Just back from the Croke Park Hotel and we had a great stay! Free parking, early check in, lovely room, great lunch deal ( soup, sandwich and coffee for 10 Euro)

Just outside the city center but the free parking make up for this. Breakfast was good but a little chaotic - being half nine on a Sunday morning this can be expected in most hotels. Very nice and very reasonably priced all round.",5,2014,01,12
211,"Lovely hotel, but not a great location","This hotel is right next to the Stadium, so it's a great place to stay if you're going to a match.

The hotel is beautiful, but the area isn't particularly nice.  We were in Dublin to sight-see, so it was a bit of a walk into town, but I suppose, good to get off the tourist trail and some of the real Dublin.

The staff were very helpful and the room met our expectations.",4,2014,01,12
211,"Lovely hotel,  terrible location.","We have just stayed at this hotel,  rooms and staff lovely. If you just wanted the hotel it would be the perfect place to stay - perhaps more for business than pleasure as it is not as close to the city centre as advertised.  On our first day we decided to walk to the centre,  this was 2pm, it took us 20-25 minutes and the whole way we felt intimidated by the area and the residents of the area. We spoke to the front desk about this, worried for getting home on a night and were told taxi is the best way to travel - this cost us €15-€20 depending on the time of day.  Only plus side to the area is it is close to the stadium and there is a brilliant Italian restaurant very oddly placed just up the road. ",4,2014,01,12
211,Overrated,"I agree with a recent previous tripadvisor review, this place is much overrated in previous reviews. A group of 4 of us stayed here this week for a business trip to the city. Location is handy for the city centre & airport but not great. The room is good value (€95/lux room) with a comfy bed, good size bathroom and quiet. However the staff are low calibre and uninterested in you or the service they provide which in general is just adequate. The food in the bar area was shockingly extreme, two had fish & chips which was good and two had the chicken curry which was terrible. There was no curry, just tough chicken and tomato! For Dublin, the just Guinness was just ok and not to the standard of any good bar in the city. Breakfast was not included and we were pleased given the evening meal experience, so we ate in one of the many excellent coffee shops around the city that serve great breakfast at half hotel prices.

Wine list is poor and again, low calibre.

The hotel has a garage which us safe and good.",3,2014,01,11
211,Great hotel,"Stayed overnight, travelled from Belfast to Dublin to see Wicked. They let us check in early, since we has nowhere else to go, which is always good. Man at the front desk was very polite, told us everything we needed to know. The room was large, with a queen sized bed so me and the mrs could both spread out with room to spare. 

My one and only issue is the iron in the room was absolute pants. Leaked water if you held if flat (obviously not the best for ironing...) and soaked my shirt wet through. Gave up as soon as it looked halfway decent. 

Overall, a very good hotel, while admittedly not in the most convenient of locations, it's cheap for how good it is, with polite helpful staff and spacious, tidy rooms. 

Oh and I forgot to mention. When I booked it along with the theatre tickets months ago, I wrote that it was an anniversary trip. The staff were kind enough to leave a note saying congratulations and what have you, and some free Prosecco! A very nice touch! 

Would definitely use this hotel again. ",5,2014,01,11
211,Good value-comfy bed,Wanted to visit for a couple days before heading home so we stayed at The Croke because of a recommendation and had read reviews. Upon arrival we were pleasantly surprised to have our room upgraded without even asking. We were also surprised to receive a discount on the Hop-On-Hop-Off City bus.  It's about a 15 minute walk to the city centre or a €10 taxi ride.,5,2014,01,11
211,An Average Ibis?,"The tripadvisor reviews have me scratching my head. We stayed one night and it was perfectly OK, I guess. 

Pros: 
-15 min to airport
- Seemingly competent staff
- clean
- large room? Hard to tell with extra unrequested bed, but OK

Negatives:
- Just...... Generally uninspiring. Staff was barely interested ('concierge' gave a terrible restaurant recommendation), minibar was almost empty (we realized in morning looking for water to take), general lack of atmosphere and location..... just... blah, ok, let me get on plane. Oh, theres no shuttle? OK. Cool. 

I don't understand what is in any way special about this place. I compare it to Ibis. Ive stayed at a few Ibis hotels that were superior in most ways - except room size (cramped in our case by weird extra bed) and food / drink availability. 

Bland but serviceable. Nothing more. (points to the clearly generally unhappy waitress who refunded my bad mojito without me asking). 

Im confused by the tripadvisor ranking. We had no special bad experience. Its simply a very, very average hotel.",3,2014,01,10
211,For business not pleasure,"The place oozes corporate hotel with monosyllabic rooms.
It's clean, comfortable and friendly. There's secure parking and secure access via the lift. Not really on the tourist track, seems to corporate for its location opposite a major events centre but obviously in reasonable demand just memorable for its dullness more than anything else.
Reason to stay here again? The amazing Italian up the road.",3,2014,01,10
211,Great hotel,We stayed here for two nights over new year and had a great time. We arrived early to the hotel as we could only get early flights and as our rooms were not ready we were allowed to access a lounge and recieved complementary drinks and breakfast. Food in the sideline bar was fantastic and all the staff were really friendly and helpful,4,2014,01,10
211,Perfect!,"I was in this hotel for 3 nights with my wife and 2 daugters (17,15). Room are perfect: spacious, clean, comfortable! Even if the location is not perfect, it's within walking distance (10-12 minutes) of O'Connell street. Next time, I will stay for a longer period.",5,2014,01,10
211,Great Stay,"Warm welcome and great facilities.  Staff were very friendly.  would definately reconmmend.  Just a short walk to the centre (temple bar street etc), approx 10 mins.  We had a balcony room which was great!!!
      
      ",5,2014,01,10
211,Perfect Place to Stay in Dublin,"This was a 4 star hotel in every sense.  The room was big and spotlessly clean with a comfy bed and nice linens, fluffy towels, a bathroom with a separate tub and glass shower.  The restaurant had a wonderful breakfast and dinner selection.  The staff was superb.  There was free, secured parking for our car and free internet.  Overall, this was a place we looked forward to coming back to after sightseeing all day!",5,2014,01,10
211,Fantastic hotel with great food and service,The Croke Park Hotel is a fantastic city centre hotel. Lovely spacious rooms with travel cot for our baby. We dined in the restaurant and the food was excellent. Great service was provided throughout our stay. Overall we enjoyed a very satisfactory stay and would highly recommend this hotel. Looking forward to our next visit to the Croke Park Hotel.,5,2014,01,08
211,Grewt hotel,"This was the first time at this hotel. Everything was good. The rooms very clean and spasious. Beds and linens wonderful. We had access to the lounge and we would have expected some more ""food"" and drinks, but still it was okay.
The staff very kind helpful. Breakfast lovely and so much to choose between. A bit hectic during the weekend though.",5,2014,01,08
211,My second visit and still a great hotel,"I think this hotel is fantastic. I have just returned home from my second stay there. The rooms are very clean, big and beds extremely comfortable and warm. The bathrooms are large with a separate shower and bath. The smellies provided are lovely and a proper hair dryer is provided to use. 

The gym is a great little gym with everything you need for a good cardio workout with decent free weights, machines and fitballs etc. 

Breakfast at croake park is faultless. Full Irish breakfast, toast, cereals, continental and fresh fruit are all in offer, something for everyone. 

It is a walk into the city, about 15 minutes but we walked it everyday and it's nice to look around. Easy enough to get the bus or taxis though if need be. 

The staff are friendly and can't do enough to help. Would definitely recommend this hotel. ",5,2014,01,07
211,Brilliant Hotel,"We stayed at this hotel between Christmas and New Year and were very impressed. Hotel is very clean, rooms are specious and light. Staff is very helpful and friendly. There is gym on site, free WI FI, hotel is only 10 min away from city centre and very easy to get to and from airport. Recommend.",5,2014,01,07
211,Fantastic hotel!,"My partner and I stayed here for four days in December 2013 and might I say this is what a hotel should be like! We were presented with fantastic staff who were willing to answer any question posed before them, a wonderfully presented room with a double and single bed (which allowed us to place our bags on them and allowed more space around the room!) and the bathroom was magnificent! It is the first time I have had a bath and enjoyed it in a hotel! For a fitness couple, the gym was great for a hotel standard, even offering some weights! Finally, the breakfast each morning was wonderful! We had breakfast included our first day and then paid 10 euros for each morning there after for a full Irish breakfast, definitely filled up for the day eating there! Which was good as the walk to Dublin city was about 20 minutes away which was very comfortable and easy. I was definitely impressed with the hotel and would recommend for others to stay as well.",5,2014,01,05
211,Perfect Hotel in the heart of Dublin,"Stayed in this hotel for one night only unfortunately it was fantastic! stayed in a delux room which was perfect , all the common areas bars, restaurant, bistro and reception were spotlessly clean and furnished to a high standard. All staff were very friendly and helpful.  The food in the resturante was excellent and plenty of choice  The breakfast had lots of choice and very enjoyable. I would recommend this hotel to anyone staying in Dublin",5,2014,01,05
211,Poor food standard,"The hotel markets itself as a high standard.  Unfortunately the food standard was very poor and the bar/bistro staff lacked training.  They were not vigilant or professional.  They were however very friendly and willing, just not very capable. 

During my one week stay I tried three meals, the remainder I chose to eat out.

1. Two Steaks was so dry they were inedible - Given numerous apologies and a two tickets to Guinness Storehouse. Hey mistakes happen, I gave them another chance.

2. Played it carefully and tried a bar snack - Cheese and pickle sandwich.  I was expecting Irish soda bread with Kerrygold butter and a good Irish cheese!  I got sliced white bread with no pickle, no presentation.

3. After avoiding the hotel food for the rest of the week we found it convenient to eat there on our 
last night.  I chose Scampi - Again poor quality lacking taste.

Very disappointed - but on the upside we got very fit walking the 20 each day to get our breakfast each day.",2,2014,01,04
211,Look nowhere else!,"These reviews don't lie. A TOP hotel only 15-20 minute walk from O'Connell Street. Staff are brilliant, rooms are brilliant, facilities are brilliant and get some amazing Irish food from the restaurant. Can't recommend highly enough!",5,2014,01,04
211,Marvellous,My family required two family rooms. We requested adjoining rooms but arrived early so that could not be accommodated. However getting two huge spotless rooms at 1pm only a few steps from each other was great. The breakfast was self service but substantial. The coffees teas and hot chocolates were served in huge pots to the table with loads of hot toast. The bar is on the expensive side but the staff are excellent friendly and professional. From start to finish brilliant service. Full marks,5,2014,01,03
211,lovely stay,"stayed  here on 27th dec  for one night 
staff  very welcoming and helpful  complementary hot choc on check in , offered help with our bags . Facilities were  excellent   new, clean , spacious ,.
Have stayed in 5* hotels in Dublin previously  and this hotel was right up there with them.
One gripe would be the quality of the duvets, slightly cold on initially getting into bed  however the season  that it is would have to be accounted for . Breakfast was v   good impressed by the choice  available.
Wouldnt  hesitate to stay  here again.",5,2014,01,02
211,PRETTY GOOD,"Just back from a 3 day stay at Croke Park. All in all, it's a good hotel. Like most other posters, I found the staff to be very friendly and helpful. 

We had a couple of teething problems: Firstly, our booking (thru e-bookers) didn't appear to have registered. Secondly, the heating in our room didn't work. On the positive side, both matters were sorted out quickly by the hotel.

Would I pay rack rate for a night? Probably not but we got a great deal (3 nights for 2) so, it was great value of money.",4,2014,01,01
211,Brilliant Stay,"We have just left this hotel after a lovely three night getaway for NYE. The hotel was perfect, clean throughout and service was excellent. The staff were so helpful and friendly especially reception/concierge and the bar/restaurant.

      ",4,2013,12,31
211,Yet another lovely stay - Highly Recommended,"Just back from a very relaxing two day break in Dublin staying at this hotel. Second visit to the Croke Park Hotel and as with the previous stay this was a top class experience. From check in to check out the hotel staff could not do enough for you even sorting out a booking error with Expedia on the type of breakfast we had paid for. Room 306 was very spacious and spotlessly clean and with access to the executive lounge on level 4 our stay was made complete. Delicious breakfast on both mornings with attentive staff ensuring a more than adequate supply of tea/coffee and toast on top of the full Irish.
As other reviews have stated it is not in the best location for easy access to the city centre but a brisk 15 minute walk brings you to O'Connell Street so for us this was not a problem.
Went to Shelbourne Park on Saturday night for greyhound raising and the hotel staff were more than helpful in ordering a taxi.
Will have no hesitation in re-booking this hotel for our next trip to Dublin - thanks to all the staff for making this a wonderful place to stay - great credit to the Doyle Collection",5,2013,12,30
211,Weekend stay,"Stayed here over the weekend.
Parking free, check in quick and hassle free.
Lifts are challenging as they are operated with the key card
Room spacious with everything you need in it and more
Dinner was excellent although service was very slow
All in all a lovely stay",5,2013,12,30
211,Very Nice Hotel - Decent Location,"We recently stayed in this hotel while visiting Dublin.  Overall I was impressed with the staff, price and quality of the hotel.  I was familiar with Doyle Collection hotels and this lived up to my expectations of this chain.  The only negative about this hotel is the location.  Unfortunately it is not conveniently located to anything other than Croke Park (which is great if you are in town for a game).  Be prepared to take rather pricey taxi service or wear comfortable shoes for a decently long walk to the city landmarks and social areas.",4,2013,12,29
211,Lovely stay :),"We came here for a two day break and found the hotel & it's staff to be of the highest quality.  Lovely clean room. Friendly staff and nice breakfasts.

If we return to Dublin then we'd definitely want to stay again.

Highly recommend :)  
",5,2013,12,29
211,"Excellent in every way, thank you so much!","Such a shame that we only used this hotel as a stop over when travelling to a friends wedding. Every member of staff was very friendly and polite, couldn't do enough for us. The rooms are incredibly clean and comfortable and the whole hotel has a great atmosphere. The food and drinks in the bar/bistro are more competitively priced and a lot nicer than the couple of city establishments that we tried. Secure, free underground parking, they also allowed us to keep the car onsite after checkout whilst we had a final tour of the city. Will definitely be coming back for a longer stay, we are dreading moving on to the next hotel as it won't be able to match Croke park. Thank you for a brilliant stay!",5,2013,12,29
211,A huge thank you to all staff!!!!,"What a wonderful hotel, wonderful staff and beautiful surroundings. I cannot speak highly enough of our stay at The Croke Park Hotel!

All staff were so friendly and helpful. We had a wonderful mini break and hope to be back again soon :)

Big recommend! ",5,2013,12,27
211,great hotel for good value,got a deal on living social +was pleased with the room although we had no breakfast included in the deal +I discovered that others had it for the same price bit disappointed in that.It was a pleasant +relaxing stay after an evening in Croke Park at the Carols Choirs +Singers I would return again,5,2013,12,27
211,Hidden Treasure,"I had the pleasure of staying at the Croke Park Hotel, Dublin for 2 nights.   Brilliant! Friendly staff and a good choice of food in the restaurant made for an excellent stay.   They could not do enough to make your stay memorable.   I especially was taken by the delicious hot chocolate served in the bar if you did not want to face the formality of the main restaurant.   The huge TV screen at the end of the bar, in the lounge with a feature flame fire under it, all made for a cosy stay - Clean rooms with comfortable beds made for a really memorable trip and I would stay here again if given the opportunity. Thank you Croke for making this a great stay.",5,2013,12,27
211,"Good 4* Hotel, but nothing amazing.","Stayed in the hotel through Secret escapes and the package which made it very good value for money. Reception was quick and easy. Bit robotic and lacking in personality though.

Delux Room Large and comfortable. Bathroom clean and great to have a bath which was taken advantage of. Normal tea/coffee making facilities. Good breakfast with a very good continental spread. 

Executive Lounge was a major disappointment. Asked what is provided and was told Snacks, fruit, Juices, tea/coffee. Went in to check it out and looks comfortable, but no snacks only a big basket of fruit. Coffee/tea machine was broken. Fridges were full of big open jugs of milk. One jug with orange juice and bottles of water. Only snack that finally appeared were disgusting home made cookies..burnt. Advised that cookies is the only snack ever provided. Something that should have added that little bit extra, just rubbish. Very easy to make better and more appealing. Only other gripes were the sink in the room being very slow to drain, reported...nothing done about it. Window in room left open by housekeeping staff. Not the best arriving back to a freezing cold room at midnight. Generally though feeling and attitude from the staff was positive and that it was a one off.",4,2013,12,25
211,Such good value!,"We just had a long weekend away staying here, and managed to get an insanely good deal on what turned out to be a really amazing hotel. Would definitely come back again... The breakfast was awesome, and the staff were very polite and helpful with us inexperienced travellers.",5,2013,12,23
211,"Decent Business Hotel, Not Stellar","The staff was quite friendly and helpful.  The facilities are clean and in good repair.  No complaints.  It is a bit removed from the center of things, but it is probably priced accordingly.  It was a solid 15 - 20 minute walk to the beginning of the sights folks want to see.  Breakfasts were adequate European style buffets.  Overall, I would recommend it, but it is not a stellar property.",3,2013,12,22
211,Lovely hotel for our weekend break,We stayed for a weekend whilst I visited Trinity College and we did a bit of sight seeing. The staff were friendly and the room was spotless - I would never have a bath at a hotel but it was literally spotless so I decided to have one (which was lovely!) It's close enough to the centre and I would definitely recommend!,5,2013,12,19
211,The best hotel we've ever stayed in!,"We’ve recently spent a long weekend at the Croke Park Hotel, we arrived a little before checking in time and although there wasn’t anything available the staff did everything they could to find us a room. We left our bags and went for a stroll. Upon our return we were checked into our room which was excellent. It was a huge room with ample space for clothes, bags and substantial lighting which was great. The bathroom was huge and extremely clean, you can tell the staff takes pride in their work and the cleaners ought to receive a bonus. The beds are large and comfortable and everything is changed and cleaned daily. Every morning you’re greeted friendly by all staff, the buffet is amazing! There is literally everything you can want and more. The service is swift and friendly and we couldn't get enough of it. The bar area was modern and comfortable. The fire/TV lounging area was great and the gym the right size. Overall a wonderful experience. Exceptional service. Great food. Great city. Great time.",5,2013,12,16
211,A wonderful stay.,"This is a very nice hotel, which is within walking distance to the City Center. It is across the street from the Croke Park stadium, which is very impressive stadium. Our room was clean, comfortable and very nicely appointed. The meals were excellent as well.",5,2013,12,14
211,Well done!,"This place is exceptional. Super friendly people, beautiful rooms, great price(!) and good food. If I come to Dublin again I would stay here no question. They give a feeling of supreme luxury, but the price doesnt reflect that!

Well done guys",5,2013,12,14
211,Royal treatment ,"Stayed here for my partners birthday and we were truly treated like royalty. The staff and the service is amazing. From the minute we arrived to the minute we left, we were smiling ear to ear. On the plus side, my partner absolutely loved it and the sporting memorabilia dotted around the hotel. Do not hesitate to book this hotel, just do it! I cannot wait to go back already! It's truly amazing:-) P.S absolutely loved the Christmas decor.",5,2013,12,13
211,Great welcome and fantastic stay,"We took advantage of a great mid-week offer to stay in the Croke Park Hotel. From the welcome we received on arrival to the goodbye on departure our stay was one that we look forward to experiencing again. The hotel team are the biggest asset of this hotel - all friendly, professional and examples of what customer service should be.  Our room was excellent and we were upgraded to executive floor so had the added bonus of access to the executive lounge! We had dinner included - the menu on offer was a very restricted - 3 choices on each - however service was excellent and we were on a very keenly priced package so the menu restrictions reflected this.  Would definitely recommend this hotel.",4,2013,12,12
211,Hotel of highest standards,"I stayed in the Croke Park Hotel a few times over the last few years most recently last weekend. 

Everything about this hotel is excellent without question. 

From prompt, courteous and efficient check in to spotlessly clean and well appointed room and bathroom with workstation which had free wifi and Ethernet connection. 

The staff in all departments I dealt with or met were all professional and friendly. 
Of note was that any domestic staff I met in the corridors all spoke to me which is not something happens in every hotel. 
My room service order was prompt and accurate. 
The room was quiet and the bed very comfortable. 
The location is excellent and only a short walk from O'Connell Street. 

Breakfast was excellent and there was a very wide range of continental and cooked food available. 

The parking is included and is secure. 

I cannot recommend this hotel highly enough. 
",5,2013,12,12
211,Wonderful!,"After an early morning flight over from London, my Mom and I were so happy that the hotel had a room available for us so early. We were greeted with warm towels to freshen up with. The room was spacious, clean, and comfortable. Every staff member was very friendly and helpful. Breakfast was good. Only downside, is that this hotel is a bit far from the city center, with not much around it.",5,2013,12,11
211,excellent,"I have nothing but good things to say.. from start to finish the service was amazing, suck friendly staff couldnt do enough for you, and the reception staff was just fab thanks to the girl from donegal for making our stay so special . Excellent food incl breakfast. Excellent spacious and clean rooms. Just couldnt fault it. I have reccomended it to so many people since and will continue to do so.
Thanks again from the newly engaged couple ,,,",5,2013,12,10
211,First class service,"We stayed here while Christmas shopping in Dublin and everything was good during our stay. Lovely staff and decor, the only disadvantage is distance from city centre and taxis were expensive. Rooms are spacious and clean.
We will definitely return.",4,2013,12,10
211,Brilliant,"While Dublin wasn't the pick of the cities we visited, this place was amazing. Staff couldn't do enough for you. Great breakfast, great sleep! Easy car parking, loved the tour of Croke Park overthe road.",5,2013,12,09
211,Business class hotel in a city setting,"As far as hotel stays this one was pleasant. The staff was friendly and helpful, and remarkably the bar food and breakfast were AMAZING.  We had 2 breakfasts and a dinner here and loved every single thing we ate, which is noteable for ""hotel food"".  That being said this hotel felt like it sat in the inner city. We were warned not to walk much around at night, which is frustrating when the hotel claims to also be ""walkable"" to City Centre and famous attractions. Several times we felt like we'd stumbled into a terrible part of town. Had it been in a safer neighborhood I would have given this a better go, but on the whole it was lovely.",3,2013,12,08
211,Fabulous Hotel in the Vibrant City of Dublin,"Arrived late afternoon, and found check in was quick and easy.  We had booked a package which gave us some wee ""extras"" which were lovely.  We found the room quickly and easily and found the room to be clean and extremely comfortable.  Two soft double beds and lots of fluffy pillows made for a great nights sleep.  Air conditioning was there if you wanted it.  
We were on the 4th floor and had use of the executive lounge where complimentary teas/coffee/hot chocolate/water and juices were available 24/7.  Fresh fruit and cookies were also there for your enjoyment.  The lounge was a haven in the hotel, peaceful and extremely comfortable.
Brekfast was a delight, with a buffet style and a pleasant smile from the waiting staff, everything was fresh, plentiful and delicious.  If you left the brekfast room hungry, it was your own fault!
We had dinner in the Sideline Bistro on one evening and it was amazing.  Well presented, good size portions and most importantly, delicious.  The waiting staff were attentive without being overbearing and nothing was too much trouble.
The late check out of 12 noon, was great for a leisurely brekfast and then a chat in the Executive lounge again.  Checkout was fast and easy and the complimentary car parking in an underground secure car park meant my car was safe and off the road.

All in all, a great hotel with great staff who are a credit to the hotel, nothing is too much trouble for them and they greeted us with a smile no matter what the time.  I would heartily recommend the Croke Park Hotel to any of my friends, and I hope to return in the near future.",5,2013,12,06
211,Back Again,"It might seem a bit silly to continue to review a hotel on return visits but I feel the Croke Park Hotel disserves another good review. Our recent visit to the hotel was another enjoyable experience. It nearly felt like going home! I love the way everything is so understated, yet so seamlessly perfect. You rightly deserve your rating as one of the top hotels in Dublin a uniquely affordable price.",5,2013,12,06
211,Smart hotel,"I stayed here for 4 nights and had no problems throughout the stay.  All the staff were polite and good at their jobs. Standard modern hotel interior, with comfortable rooms.  Despite there being several very loud Americans staying there, thankfully our sleep was not disturbed!",5,2013,12,06
211,"Nice hotel, nice food but service in bar was poor",Stayed here on wed 5th dec. very friendly and warm welcome from both girls on reception desk on check in on wed evening. Rooms are clean and modern. Went for food in bar. Food was lovely so we decided to have a desert and coffee. We finished our main course and  after waiting 40 mins for someone to clear our plates and take our order for dessert we decided to leave. Went to pay at bar and was met with a grunt and was handed back the receipt without a thank you. Disappointing considering the food was lovely,3,2013,12,05
211,Really enjoyed an overnight stay at Croke Park hotel,"Very pleasant stay, very stylish rooms even the view over the internal courtyard was pleasant. Breakfast was nice  with a great selection of hot and cold, including nice cheeses. It's not the nicest part of Dublin, but Drumcondra is a short walk away.",5,2013,12,05
211,Last day in Ireland,"We stayed here the last two days on CIE tour. Great location and a really nice hotel. Shuttle to Dublin, quick and easy! Rooms were super nice and clean.. Would highly recommend and plan to stay if I go off tour again.. Fish & Chips our last day were to die for!",4,2013,12,04
211,Fantastic Stay!,"My husband and I recently stayed here for our first wedding anniversary, my husband had told the hotel this in advance and they upgraded us to a deluxe room and had Prosecco and a card in the room for us!

Our entire weekend continued like this, the staff in this hotel really cannot do enough for you, they were so friendly and helpful.

The hotel itself is really lovely, a really relaxing bar, well designed rooms and our breakfast both mornings was excellent.  Having previously lived in Dublin I know how expensive the city centre hotels are, if you are planning a trip to the city I cannot recommend this hotel enough, not only is the parking complimentary but the welcome you receive is second to none.

Thank you very much for a wonderful weekend!",5,2013,12,03
211,Very enjoyable stay.,"This is a really nice hotel in a great central location. The hotel provides free onsite parking which is always good, and there were several other nice touches, like the hot damp towels to refresh us on arrival.
The food was very good. The staff are very friendly, polite, well trained and efficient. The room was very nicely decorated and comfortable, and had all the facilities expected including fast wifi, even the bathroom toiletries were more luxurious than the standard. It is the nicest hotel experience we have had in a long while.",5,2013,12,02
211,Great stay and highly recommended,"We stayed 2 nights at the hotel, we were welcomed with friendly and helpful staff right from the beginning. The rooms are of top quality as are all the facilities. Breakfast was excellent. Location of the hotel is prefect, short taxi/bus ride from the airport, and a cheap taxi ride/ nice walk into the centre! Absolutely recommend this hotel for a stay in Dublin.",5,2013,12,02
211,Very friendly staff!,I stayed at The Croke Park Hotel for one night. The rooms were spacious and had updated bathrooms. The view from the windows weren't spectacular but it's set a bit away from the city. It's an easy walk to the main attractions of the city but I wouldn't recommend it late at night. The staff at the hotel was very friendly. Some of the nicest people I came across on my trip! ,4,2013,11,30
211,Wasnt the best i must say,"Poor reception service, not nice to deal with following my fathers heart operation in the near by Mater Private Hospital, The reception staff knew the reason we were staying there but i felt like we were an announce to certain members of the reception team, water was supplied to guests on arrival but we were not giving any. Avoid the Hotel if there is a game on in adjecent croke park stadium and you venture out for the day as the Garda will not let you get back to the hotel if your in a taxi WITHOUT a passport. Only good thing was the breakfast. Dust was a biggy in this hotel .",2,2013,11,28
211,Very enjoyable stay,"I had the pleasure of staying in the croke park hotel recently while visiting Dublin for a night. The check in staff were very pleasant, efficient & helpful. We ate dinner in the bar & I couldn't fault it. Lovely menu, good service & very tasty food & wine. The room was very clean & comfortable. I would definitely stay in this hotel again. ",4,2013,11,27
211,couldnt have been better!!,"Have just got back from a 3night break with the other half and I can honestly say this hotel was more than good value for the price we paid (we were lucky enough to grab a bargain).
The staff couldn't have been more helpful and pleasant, especially the concierge that sold us our hop-on hop-off bus tickets(also recommended),
Our room was big, clean and made us feel very homely...the beds were even better...memory foam...lovely! Breakfast each day was a hot and cold buffet which suited us perfectly as we filled up so much in the morning that we didn't eat again until the evening, very tasty food!
 Location was perfect as not far from the airport and just a short bus journey into town, which was very reasonably priced, also directly opposite croke park stadium for those who love sport.
 Overall can safely say that if we visit Dublin again we would most definitely stay here!",5,2013,11,24
211,Great place but not location ,The accommodations were great and their breakfast was fantastic however the location was a little far from the city center and the neighborhood didn't feel safe to walk at night. With that said it was fine during the day and not more than a 15 minute walk. ,4,2013,11,24
211,Pleasant stay with a few small issues.,"I first off want to say that our stay was great, good service, and nice atmosphere.

Now for everything. I booked this hotel for a 4 night stay so my wife and me could visit before we moved in a month. When we booked i didn't realize that my wife had called earlier to request a bottle of prosecco and a note in our room for our belated anniversary, well needless to say it was not in the room even after requesting a time that would co-inside with our flight and travel arrangements, so that was one thing. Next which is a big issue for me is when we left the room I had put the do not disturb sign on the door mainly because I don't like people going around my stuff, its just a person decision. The room in turn was actually entered and made up, which is nice and all but the exact OPPOSITE of what I had requested. 

We did check out the restaurant as well, made a reservation but no one actually wrote it down on the reservation list. Food was very good but lack of communication between the wait staff had us telling 4 different people that we wanted to wait and enjoy our drinks before ordering. 

all that being said it was a great stay and I probably would return again, but of course there was some issues.",4,2013,11,23
211,"Bustling, well run Hotel","I stayed here 1 night on the last day of a CIE tour.  The desk staff were very efficient and helpful, and the rooms are modern and comfortable.  Had to leave before breakfast, but was given a take away bag with yogurt, fruit, muffin and juice.  Lobby area very elegant and immaculately clean. Great location for touring Dublin.",5,2013,11,22
211,Nice Hotel with Good Breakfast,"15 minute walk to O'Connell Street. Two attractions across street at stadium. Can be dangerous walking into town at night, but I had no problems. Taxi to airport took 10-15 minutes and was 20 euro. Concierge was helpful and free shuttle to Hop-on, Hop-off bus on O'Connell leaves 3 times each morning.",4,2013,11,22
211,What service!,"We enjoyed exeptional service at Croke Park Hotel. They went above and beyond expectations to accomodate us and our baby. The facility is very nice, clean, and elegant. The parking is easy and free and the breakfast was wonderful. It is across the street from the stadium and we were sorry it was not the season for games, but we enjoyed watching rugby with a pint by the fire in the bar. Downtown is within walking distance.",5,2013,11,21
211,Standards are still high,"Stayed in the croke park hotel last night. It has been a while since I stayed so was not disappointed. Standards are still high, staff extremely helpful from front desk to maids.variety of foods for breakfast was good & seemed quite busy for a Wednesday morning. Will definitely stay again - great for conferences but also only 10 min walk from city centre",5,2013,11,20
211,Staff fantastic!,"Stayed here for 3 nights and loved every minute of it.  The location is perfect for exploring Dublin as the hop on/off bus leaves from right out the front (only twice a day but at great times).  The staff here were so welcoming and friendly.  Nothing was too much trouble.  Housekeeping were very friendly and assisted us with getting a new room key when ours wouldn't work.  The standard of cleaning in this property is one of the best I have ever seen.

The bar and restaurant served fantastic meals and at great prices.  All staff we came into contact with were friendly and they are a credit to this property.  You can see they take pride in their property.

I would recommened this property to anyone coming to stay in Dublin.",5,2013,11,20
211,Fantastic stay,"Stayed here overnight for our 25th anniversary, it was a package deal in a deluxe room with 3 course meal. Dinner came with free champagne and a congratulation card it was such a nice gesture, food was excellent and access to the executive lounge was great, fresh coffee and bottled water when you wanted, could not find any faults with this hotel all the staff were helpful and very pleasant. ",5,2013,11,19
211,Perfection!!,"Absolutely gorgeous hotel,great location, lovely, pleasant staff and spacious rooms! Can not fault. Will definitely be back!! 

If you are going...make sure you know how to get into town...we did not ask for directions and what should have been a 10/15 min walk turned into 1.5hours!!",5,2013,11,18
211,Some of the best service I've received as a hotel guest.,"Lovely, modern friendly hotel.
We got an upgrade to the executive floor, which was lovely. The service was second to none. 
My only criticism would be the location, but that's being picky.
Just a short taxi journey from the city centre.
Our stay was very enjoyable.",5,2013,11,18
211,Very good,"Our visit to Croke Park Hotel was excellent. On arrival we were checked in early, given complimentary drinks vouchers and given access to the executive lounge. There were lots of nice little touches, such as free snacks at the bar and the turn down service each evening. This included chocolates and a hot lavender thingy which was placed in the bed to warm it up. The room was great and the bathroom very spacious. The staff were very attentive and friendly, especially the room service. Would definitely return. ",5,2013,11,16
211,Nice Hotel,"Stayed here for one night after our CIE Tour.  The hotel was very nice, the rooms were very large and the bed was comfortable.  Breakfast was included but we had to leave very early for the airport, a box snack was available at the front desk.  Wish we could have stayed longer, it was a nice choice for the last night, near the airport, too.  Staff was very friendly.  A good choice.",4,2013,11,15
211,Very nice,"My husband and I stayed here for four nights after spending four in London during our honeymoon trip. It was a very nice suprise to find that the manager left us champagne in our room with a note congradulating us. Our room was very nice and we enjoyed the bar downstairs. Our room came with breakfast, which was a nice buffet. Our only complaint was that it is somewhat outside the center of Dublin. The hop on hop off bus did pick us up each morning, but the last bus back was at 4pm. We would usually take it back, and just relax at the hotel bar for the rest of the night, or go back out and pay for a taxi.",5,2013,11,15
211,Almost Perfect,"We toured Ireland the 3rd week of October 2013, and had the most amazing time. Driving around Irland is very daunting , and when you get to your hotel for the evening one would expect to rest, relax, and enjoy the rest of the evening.  If you end up, or start for that matter, in Dublin, Ireland, you should consider staying at the Croke Park Hotel.  It's on the North side of the city, away from most of the hussle and bussle of the main tourist area. 6 Euro will get you to where you want to go in Dublin.  When we checked in to the Croke Park , we were met with one of the most friendly fronts desks I've ever encountered. The ""Lass"" (I forgot to get her name) got us checked in and situated on everything we were going to need to know during our stay. Once in our rooms, we found them very well appointed, and comfortable. One strange thing though, and we found this at all 5 hotels we stayed in, was that there was a queen bed and a small single bed. If you travel Ireland in a group, you should keep that in mind.. The only problem we encountered with our stay was in the Sideline Bistro. After a long day of touring Dublin , we went to the Hotel's  Sideline Bistro for deserts and cocktails. The food and beverages were excellent, but only had one round. That was because we never got our server to return to us.  I'm sure this was an isolated personal problem, and am confident after talking and e-mailing the Manager, Sean, that this wll not happen again. Being that this was our last evening in Ireland ,it did upset us a bit. The next morning we had a wonderful breakfest and the food and service was excellent. When we return to Ireland (4 couples ) we would like to spend a few days just in Dublin, and we WILL be staying at the Croke Park Hotel.
                                                                                                                  G. Hare",5,2013,11,14
211,Pleasantly surprised..,stayed here in october and found it to be a very enjoyable visit. the hotel was modern and the rooms are lovely. staff couldnt have been nicer and room service was quick. i dont have a bad word to say about this hotel and i can be hard to please at times!,5,2013,11,12
211,Wonderful Hotel In Dublin,This was the nicest hotel we stayed at during our travels through Europe.  The room was large and spacious with a wonderful King size bedroom and a bathroom with a separate shower and tub.  I mainly chose it for the free parking (underground) which was a rarity in Dublin.  It was fairly easy drive from the Airport though we didn't drive much in the City.  The concierge was very helpful when we needed a place to get some laundry done and didn't want to pay per piece at the hotel.   The only thing that kept this from being perfect was that it was a 20-minute walk or 10-Euro cab ride from the central Temple Bar / Trinity area.  But that sacrifice was more than made up for by the wonderful facilities.  And the quiet!,5,2013,11,11
211,GETS BETTER,"Have just returned from the Croke Park , having previously stayed here in April. As on our previous visit we found all the staff friendly, engaging and extremely helpful without being intrusive.Rooms for a city centre hotel are large and extremely well equipped.
Nearest restaurant is literally one minute away, and yes it sells pizza, and the nearest pub about another 30 seconds on, just round the corner!

Granted it is about a ten minute stroll to Parnell Square and the bright lights of the city, which means, as other contributors have mentioned, a good nights sleep without the noise and hassle experienced in many other Dublin hotels...Keep up the good work.",5,2013,11,11
211,The best in Dublin!!,"My partner booked The Croke Park Hotel for a surprise break for my birthday..... And he picked unbelievably well!!! The hotel is stunning, with the most friendly, helpful, polite and welcoming staff you could imagine.
The hotel is a good 10min walk from the centre but means that on a night it's quiet to sleep rather than being surrounded by noisy bars. There is a nice bar/restaurant just a few mins walk on the same road as well if you didn't want to go into town.
At breakfast no request was too much, and it was nice to have a buffet breakfast which was hot and fresh rather than just warm!!! The continental breakfast looked lush too!!!
Would happily recommend to anyone looking to go to Dublin and would love to stay here again!!!
Thanks to all the staff for making our visit so fantastic!!!!! ",5,2013,11,10
211,Fantastic Hotel,"Stayed at Croke Park Hotel for 3 nights bed and breakfast and it was amazing!!!! The room was immaculate, toiletries, hairdryer, iron etc. Staff we're very attentive and helpful. The buffet breakfast was gorgeous. We was concerned about the hotel being out the way of the city centre but it was literally a 15 minute walk nothing at all as long.
We would definitely recommend this hotel and would come back.",5,2013,11,10
211,Not walkable to any restaurants,"Very nice hotel across from the stadium, but there are absolutely no places to go out to eat, even for a pizza or a beer, without taking a taxi. It is in a neighborhood where there is just nothing. I was tired after sightseeing so we just ate at the hotel. The food in the bar area is very good.Their best perk is that there is a shuttle to the hop-on-hop-off bus in the morning and one shuttle back to the hotel in the afternoon.",4,2013,11,09
211,Don't hesitate,"Fab hotel, a good 4 stars with great value for money. Modern building, spacious bedrooms and bathroom, cd docking station, safe, mini bar etc etc. Breakfast was busy but long opening.  Location is OK and quiet.  We got 16 bus from Airport to bus stop 48 (outside Quinn's pub) and it's 400 metres to the Hotel.  Can walk to city centre in 45 mins but we got 3 day rambler bus pass for 15 euros which gave unlimited bus travel in Dublin.  Best pub in area in Flannagins which is 20 min walk but worth it.",5,2013,11,08
211,Billy Joel Concert,"Stayed for just one night.  Checked in at 3pm.  Staff were courteous and welcoming.  Room was excellent, as was breakfast for really low price paid.  Would love to stay again for a longer period.
only negative, one member of bar staff was not polite .",4,2013,11,06
211,Very warm welcome,"We stayed in a deluxe room which could not be faulted , we arrived after midnight as we got lost  and the receptionist could not have been nicer and got us hot chocolates which was so nice :) breakfast was great and we dinned a couple of evenings in the restaurant which was lovely continental breakfast was available in the lounge which was peaceful  . The hotel has secure free parking which is a bonus . Only down side is its a bit out the way for city centre but this doesn't stop it being our number 1 hotel in Dublin .",5,2013,11,06
211,Amazing!,"This hotel is amazing! 
Gorgeous rooms and kind staff!
The breackfast was absolutely delicious, the rooms were clean and well furnished, the lounge area was relaxing and warm.
We really enjoyed our vacation.
Hope to come back soon!",5,2013,11,05
211,Very impressive,I stayed in the CP hotel for the first time in a few months - the last time I stayed I was not impressed by their breakfast but this time I have to say they have upped their game and my stay was very pleasant and full marks for not charging for parking-highly recommend this hotel for a very pleasant stay and looking forward to going back- Rebel Yell!,5,2013,11,05
211,Great hotel,"I just come back from a 3 night stay at this hotel, I Must admit it was the best ive ever been to. 

When we arrived we were greeted by very friendly receptionist where we were offered a wet towel to freshen up after the journey. they then explained everything very well about the hotel. 

The room was very clean and lots of space, the rooms were cleaned every day. the only fault was that the shower could of been hotter and have a bit more pressure. 

the beakfast was great, this was a buffet which included full irish breakfast and other options such as cereal, fruit and continental style, the staff there were also very friendly and helpful.

it was about 15- 20 minute walk into the city centre or to connolly station, The walk does pass through some run down areas on the way but didnt bother me allot. 

overall it was a great stay and would definetly return if i next visit dublin. thanks for a great stay to everyone who is part of the croke park hotel.",5,2013,11,05
211,A highly recommended hotel with great service style!,"On arrival at this hotel, we were greeted by a friendly receptionist who checked us in to our room within seconds. She explained the usual procedures like services the hotel offers and how to get to our room. Guests are offered a hot towel upon arrival too! After finding our room we went straight to breakfast (served between 6.30-10.30am) which was amazing. Buffet style with waitress service offering tea/coffee and toast. Food was of 5* quality. Cereals, fruit and yogurts, traditional hot food items like eggs and bacon also. All food was fresh and topped up regularly.

As for the room, great comfort and style. Always cleaned daily. Very spacious and modern also. The bathroom consists of a separate bath and shower. The only improvement could be a warmer shower as we found this could be fairly cold at times and not very fast either.

I would highly recommend this hotel to all business and leisure visitors who are looking for a comfortable and relaxing stay at a reasonable price. The Croke Park hotel certainly beat my expectations and I will be staying here again. 15-20 min walk to city centre.",5,2013,11,05
211,One night in Dublin,Nice hotel across the street from the stadium.  Approx a 15 minute walk to city centre....great walk thru neighborhoods to Trinity College and all other Dublin sites.  Staff was very accommodating since we arrived at 7:30 am and check in was not till 2pm.  They held our bags and expedited our check in.  Concierge gave amazing directions to Kilkenny thru the Sally Gap via Powerscourt Gardens.  Rooms were nice and lounge area was lovely.  Large sitting area with fireplace.  The  breakfast and service was amazing.  I would definitely recommend this hotel.,4,2013,11,04
211,Great Hotel,"I was very impressed with this hotel from the moment I arrived.  The service here was amazing!  From the front desk to the concierge to the restaurant staff - excellent!  The location is a little away from the city centre - but it was an easy 15 minute or so walk.  If you are attending an event @ Croke Park Stadium - it is literally across the street!!!   

Breakfast was fantastic - lots of choices - very tasty. The room was a good size on the Executive Floor and I had access to the Executive Lounge which was nice to be able to get water, tea and light snacks throughout the day.  Loved the cookies!!!  There was also an ice machine on this floor - which I loved!!  I did not however, love the water pressure in the shower....took a long time to rinse my long hair.  

There are 2 computer terminals available in the lobby that are free to use - but please be aware if someone is waiting...try not to monopolize the time - like one lady did on several occasions!  

I definitely recommend this hotel if you don't mind the 15 minute walk to O'Connell Street.  The hotel is very close to Connelly Station where I departed from to head to Belfast.  Excellent hotel choice for me!",5,2013,11,03
211,Very Enjoyable,"We enjoyed our stay here from start to finish. Underground parking to start, quick and easy check-in, nice rooms, good food and great value restaurant, good location and finally a good atmosphere in the hotel. Only negative was that some parts of ground floor are a little worn and tired looking.",4,2013,11,03
211,"Beautiful, clean, and modern!","This hotel is absolutely lovely! Very clean and hotel staff was extremely helpful and very happy to help! The only downside, if you can really even call it that, is the location....it was about a 20 minute walk to O'Connell...BUT the cleanliness, comfort, and value  of the hotel more than made up for that! I would certainly recommend this wonderful hotel!",5,2013,11,03
211,Great hotel,"Another stay in the hotel great breakfast,if you are looking for a Dublin hotel the Croke Park Hotel is first class.We had a great meal in the Sideline bistro.Checkout is at 12,so no big rush after breakfast.Rooms very clean and very comfortable beds",5,2013,11,03
211,Excellent hotel,"I knew from previous reviews that this was a great hotel but sometimes reviews can build something up and when you visit it can be a letdown. Not in this case. From the minute we arrived at the hotel I was not disappointed, from the free parking to the easy & efficient check-in, I knew it was going to be good. The family room was a good size, spotlessly clean and had everything we needed and more. The staff were very helpful, nothing was too much trouble. I have one quibble that I'd like to mention though - on the first night we went to the Bistro to eat as we arrived quite late in the evening. It was a Monday night so we thought it wouldn't be too busy and it didn't look particularly busy when we sat down. However we ended up sitting at our table for over an hour waiting for the main course. Numerous times we had to catch the attention of a waiter to try to find out where our food was - we'd had a long journey and we needed food!! When it finally arrived our little girl couldn't eat hers as she was too tired, so we ended up eating quickly and went back to our room. Considering the meal cost almost €70 we were a bit disappointed. But that is the only downside to our stay in this hotel. Everything else was 100% and I would certainly stay there again (but we'll go into town for dinner!).",5,2013,11,01
211,Finally a hotel with a Corby Trouser Press,"Chose this hotel as it had an agreed rate with the company that was hosting the meeting, was near the companies’ offices, and was not that far from the centre of town. They also have a complimentary shuttle in the mornings to the Eastpoint Business Park, a very nice touch.

I have to say that this hotel fulfilled my expectations and that I have nothing serious to gripe about.

I do however have to congratulate them on having a Corby Trouser Press in the room, something I think more hotels should have.

The room was spacious and comfortable; the bathroom was a decent size, with separate bath and shower. The only small gripe here was the water pressure of the shower, and that it did not have a shower head on a hose to be able to rinse certain places :-)

Once again I urge this hotel, as with all others, to put ""universal sockets"" in the rooms.

The wifi worked very well, and the TV had a good selection including movies to rent at prices that could get a little cheaper (7 Euros a movie). At least they beat the Novotel in Geneva (21 Euros), but then anybody probably could.

The breakfast had a good selection. One thing I liked very much was they had freshly fried eggs in a “Chafing Dish”.

Overall, I would recommend this hotel and use it again if I was going to Dublin.",4,2013,10,31
211,everything is good about this hotel,"We went for a conference in Croke Park stadium and decided to stay in this hotel. Everything from checking-in, room service, behavior of the staff, continental breakfast were very very good. For the price, treatment you get is fantastic. They even upgraded us to an executive room. One problem for the tourists could be the distance from centre of the city. But the experience in the hotel more than compensate....",5,2013,10,30
211,Excellent in all areas,"My mate and I stayed here in October as we were playing in the Boylesports IPO in the Regency. The Croke Park was an ideal location as it was a short walk to the city centre as well as being only a short walk to the IPO. From check-in to check-out everything was top notch. Check-in was quick and easy with no delays, even tho the lobby was full of dancers who were involved in a competition in the stadium. The rooms we had were excellent, spotlessly clean and had everything you could need, including a small safe.

Breakfast was a buffet with plenty of choice, so it meant if you left hungry, it was your own fault. The free car park was a nice bonus, as a lot of hotels in Dublin charge their guests, but we were able to leave the car parked until the evening of the Sunday after we had checked out and there was still no charge.

A number of people have posted about the location not being the best, but to be honest there are worse places in Dublin and having stayed on a weekend I had no problems with location.

I'll definately stay again",5,2013,10,30
211,Amazing hotel! Great Location!,"I booked this hotel for my girlfriend and I as a surprise birthday trip for her to Dublin. We stayed between 14th-17th October 13. 
I can imagine people would overlook booking this hotel because it isn't in the 'heart of Dublin' however I can confirm it is a max 15 minute walk to the centre of town and it's really easy to navigate around. We used one bus while we stayed in Dublin and that was only to get from the hotel to the zoo. Navigating is really easy. 
The hotel itself is a stones throw from Croke Park Stadium. It is right next to a canal and a train track but don't let this put you off, you cannot hear the trains. When we arrived we were given a pleasant greeting from the staff member and when they discovered it was a special occasion they upgraded our room to an executive room with access to the executive lounge on the 4th floor. 
The hotel is very secure, you have to use the room key card in order to operate the lifts (preventing unwanted visitors). The room itself was very luxurious, huge bed, big tv, nice view facing the canal and city centre and both bath and large walk in shower. The hotel provided premium quality toiletries which was great as we travelled with hand luggage only on the airplane so were restricted to 100ml liquids!
The concierge service was very helpful. We went to him in the morning and asked what bus to take to attractions and he told us exactly where to stand to get on the bus and described the surrounding as to where we had to get off as well - very knowledgable!
Breakfast was included in our hotel package - everything was nice but the only drawback was that there were a few items that you had to specially request - baked beans being one which was annoying having to wait for them to come but only a minor issue. Danish pastries were lovely and service was great! 
The executive lounge was a large room with a range of sofas and chairs and a television and daily newspapers. It had complimentary bottles of water, jugs of juice, range of tea, coffee and got chocolates. It also served continental breakfast in the morning. We did not use this room much as it was only two of us but I feel we would have used it more if there was a group of us. 
On the day we left we checked out at 12:00 and the hotel allowed us to leave our bags in their secure room. 
Overall we had a great experience at Croke Park Hotel and I would definitely stay again if visiting to Dublin. Do not be put off by the distance on a map with this hotel, it's really closer than you think!",5,2013,10,30
211,Fun!,"The Croke Park Hotel is *right* across the street from Croke Park stadium, and if you're there during a major sporting event, you'll be in the thick of the action, perfect for people watching and celebrating. The rooms are spacious, well appointed, and comfortable. Breakfast was plentiful and very good, and the lounge areas were sleek and comfortable. Staff was very friendly and accommodating. The neighborhood is fine -- an easy walk to central Dublin. Parking was included in the room rate and our car was well protected in a covered garage -- ideal for exploring Dublin without the hassle of driving downtown. Would stay here again!",5,2013,10,28
211,I love it,"I stay here all the time, once a week and love it.

Well done and enjoyable.

Worst; check in by some staff, some of which have been there for the 3 years I have been going. Where's the management?

Best; breakfast. Very well done  ",4,2013,10,28
211,Absolutely flawless,"The hotel in its self is in an excellent location and I felt at complete ease staying in the hotel. Everything about the stay was completely relaxing and the staff were very helpful I have stayed there a few times in the last few weeks and I cannot criticise the hotel in any way shape or form a very well run establishment and if its business or pleasure I'd fully advise the hotel to anyone 
Ps if you are dining in the hotel the fish and chips is incredible ",5,2013,10,27
211,New Hotel,"First the good news. This is a new hotel, so there is air conditioning, nice sized rooms, a bathtub and a separate walk in shower, a place to hook up your I-whatever, large flat screen TV, a keyboard that attaches to the TV, lots of lights,and so forth.  The bad news is that your room key card has to be left in the slot to run the lights (and outlets), so when you leave for the day, you cannot charge anything.  AND, at night, the power to the outlets is turned off, so even if you leave the card in the slot so that you can turn on a light at night, you cannot charge anything up because the outlets will not work.  I assume they do not want the coffee pot or the iron to be left on or something, but it is a hassle if you are in a tour group and are not there during the day, you cannot charge anything up.  Second, the restaurant/bar staff seem very new along with the building. They are nice enough, but not efficient or even competent, actually.  The food, also was ok, but not excellent in any way. The hotel is also in an industrial section of the city.  My room overlooked train tracks.  Our tour group was picked up by bus in the mornings, so we had no problem, but it is a very long walk to downtown Dublin and I would not try it at night or alone.  Also I would not like to stay there when there was a football (soccer to us Americans) game being played at the stadium.  It is certainly a beautiful hotel, and I am sure it will improve in time, and I also assume that eventually the whole area will be improved due to this hotel and the stadium.",4,2013,10,27
211,Nice hotel,"Nice hotel next to Croke Park. Great nights sleep, friendly staff and nice breakfast. Would only staff here if visiting Croke Park otherwise I'd stay in a more central hotel, especially if you arent't good with directions. Taxi fare out to here isn't too bad though..",5,2013,10,26
211,Nice hotel ....far from city center,"We enjoyed our stay here. Hotel room was very nice and staff were professional and helpful. Breakfast was good.  It is a long walk to restaurants and city center. We rode the Hop on bus in the morning however needed to take a taxi back in the evening. 

Great location if you are attending an event at the stadium. Close to the airport.",4,2013,10,25
211,ATTENTION TOURIST VISITORS,"First of all, as a visitor from another country, I thought Croke Park was a park - it is not!  It is a sports stadium in an industrial section of town.  My room looked out on industrial buildings, railroad tracks and crumbling piers on the canal.  Certainly not the park I was expecting.  Second, if you are comparing prices, add the cost of taxis to and from the hotel.  My taxi rides into the city center cost 10 Euros on average and I made 4 one day and 3 the next.  It is a very long walk into the centre of town, very difficult when carrying luggage.  There didn't seem to be any restaurants within a reasonable walk, so eating at the hotel or in town (by taxi) were the choices.  The rooms are virtually identical to the rooms in a sister hotel, the River Lee in Cork, Ireland, though I believe the River Lee rooms were kept a little cleaner.
So if you are looking for a hotel away from the city center, with cranky and inattentive restaurant staff, and city centre pricing, this is it.",3,2013,10,24
211,excellent stay,"a lovely hotel, not at all far from the city centre. clean and comfortable, nothing too much trouble. Great breakfast, pay for it at check-in to save a few euros. You will be issued with a breakfast voucher to exchange for a delicious breakfast with a lovely selection of tasty, well-cooked food. on departure we were offered bottles of water for our journey...a lovely touch. Will definitely stay there again on my next visit to Dublin. :)",5,2013,10,23
211,Would Definitely Return,"CIE tour of 14 days and 9 hotels, and this was one of the best. Clean, spacious rooms and helpful staff. No problem or cost for wifi (pass code was provided as part of check-in). Food was great both in quality as well as selection. Friendly staff from check-in thru dining. Clean, well appointed and spacious bath. The type of hotel that I would have enjoyed for several more days.",5,2013,10,23
211,Birthday weekend in Dublin's Croke Park Hotel .,"This hotel was lovely from start to end. We booked it last minute and got a great deal, not knowing what to expect from the price being so low but we were very pleased. On arrival we were given hot towels to freshen up (lovely touch),when we were asked the reason for our visit we were upgraded to the executive floor as it was my birthday, this included a better room with a bath and a massive walk in shower, free toiletries, bathrobes and slippers. We also were able to have breakfast each morning in the executive lounge which was lovely. Bed was massive, pillows a bit hard though. We had a view of the canal which was ok. We did not eat in the hotel, just had drinks, when they brought the drinks they also gave us a nut&crisps bowl (another nice touch). Prices were extortionate everywhere in Dublin so it didn't make the hotels seem as bad, I did have a cocktail one night though and even though it was the hotel's signature cocktail, it cost 14 Euro  ....... the location was good, it was walking distance to o;connell street and all the main attractions although we only walked there and got a taxi back, it took 10 minutes in flat shoes and 15-20 mins in heels lol.... taxi back cost 15 euro the first night and 6.50 euro on the second so be careful what way they take you.....scenic route = extra cash for them. We went to a celtic night show in the Arlington hotel which included a 3 course meal for 35 euros each, had a brilliant night and would def recommend. Free parking also included in the hotel stay which was needed. All in all a lovely stay in Dublin at a top class hotel. Will definitely be back again. Thanks Croke Park Hotel for a lovely birthday weekend away... room 217.",4,2013,10,22
211,Nice hotel - not a great location,"Our room in this hotel was very comfortable. We didn’t eat in the hotel beyond breakfast, which was good. The service overall was efficient and friendly. The one problem with the hotel is its location. It’s great if you are going to an event at the Croke Park Stadium across the road, which I was doing, but, for my wife who was with me, it was quite a long walk into the centre of town, and the first part of the walk is through an area that most locals suggested we avoid - especially at night. The concierge told her that the hop-on, hop-off bus called regularly at the hotel, so she booked a 2-day ticket. The bus did indeed pick up a number of times in the morning, but only one bus - the 4:15 I believe it was, came back around in the afternoon. It would really be nice if the hotel offered a shuttle service into town - this would have made the difference between a good rating and a very good rating.",4,2013,10,21
211,First Class Hotel,"We just returned from a one week trip to Ireland and spent the most comfortable nights of our trip at the Croke Park Hotel.  This hotel offers a clean, safe parking garage, excellent and friendly check-in service, very clean and modern rooms, and excellent food at the bar and restaurant.  The Hop-on-hop-off tour bus picks you up right at the hotel and it is an easy 15 minute walk or 5 minute taxi ride back from the closest tour bus stop.",5,2013,10,21
211,Superb Staff,"Everything in the good reviews below is absolutely true. Bright modern and great value for money. The rooms are huge and have fantastic bathrooms. 

But above all the staff are simply superb. They cannot do enough to help",5,2013,10,21
211,Class hotel,"My sister and I stayed in this hotel,just for a break,lovely rooms staff couldn't do enough for you so friendly. Food was very good. Just €9 to get a taxi into the city centre. Will differently stay here again. Lovely big telly in the room. Very clean",5,2013,10,19
211,Break,"Excellent Hotel.  Staff couldn't do enough for us. My-self and my sister had 3 nights stay in the hotel. Great food , breakfast was great my sister loved the breakfast. Rooms were lovely and clean. Room service was great. Would go back to stay in the hotel.",5,2013,10,19
211,conference stay,"stayed overnight when attending conference in Croke Park. Staff helpful and no problem to leave car in car park when attending conference. Bar staff friendly and helpful. room near lift but spacious and clean. 
Twin room but beds were huge!",4,2013,10,19
211,Excellent Last Stop!,"This hotel was our last stop before leaving Ireland.  We were extremely pleased with the spacious accommodations.  We wanted to be closer to the airport and still be able to get to the center of the city of Dublin.  The staff was helpful in every way from directions, to printing boarding passes, and offering complementary bottles of water for the trip.
The Hunts, Indiana, USA",5,2013,10,18
211,Wonderful hotel,"This hotel is just wonderful
Spacious and bright rooms in a great location only a 10 minute stroll from O Connell St, the staff are very helpful and were more than happy to answer any request.Loved the chill out room if you upgraded to the premium grade room.",5,2013,10,16
211,What a gem......,"Having just returned from a weekend away in dublin staying at the Croke Park Hotel i cannot wait to return.

Our deluxe room was on the 4th floor and we had unlimited access to the Executive Lounge as part of the booking....this i have never experienced.  There was tea, coffee, juice, bottled water, biscuits, fruit available all day every day and a continental breakfast was provided of which you could eat as much as you wanted.  This included pastries, fruit, yoghurt, cereal, jams and spreads....it was a little piece of heaven.  The room itself was a cosy lounge area with a tv screen and plenty of room - although there was hardly anyone in there when we were there.

Our room was beautifully made up with a super-king size bed, and very comfortable.  The bathroom was spotless, it had a seperate bath and a very large shower with toiletries available.

It was a very short distance to the city centre (roughly 5-10min walk) although on the second day we found a short cut which was ideal.

I would recommend this hotel to anyone who stays in Dublin",5,2013,10,16
211,Very Pleased,"Me and My Gf travelled to Dublin at the start of the month, We were very happy with our hotel it ticked every box it possibly could.
It was clean, Spacious, helpful and friendly staffed and breakfast was lovely! 
Its about a 10min walk/5mins in a cab or a bus from the entrance to the city centre so was quiet at night but easy to get around from and too would highly recommend staying here.",5,2013,10,16
211,Three weekends,"We recently returned from Ireland we were there for 16 nights, six of them at the Croke Park Hotel. The hotel is lovely, the staff could not be kinder or more attentive. The breakfast was great and though some people warned us about the surrounding neighborhood, we walked around at night and never felt unsafe. Most of the sights we wanted to see were an easy walk from the hotel, as were bus and train stations. We felt very at home there and would recommend it to anyone. While we were there a hurling championship game was on across the street. After the game it looked like a thousand people wanted to come in to the hotel, the staff handled the crowd with good humor and kindness!",5,2013,10,15
211,Nice hotel - shame about being disturbed each morning,"Stayed in the Croke Park Thursday until Sunday, booked ""executive room"" on fourth floor. Great room and nice facility with executive lounge etc.....however each morning we were awoken 6am onwards by banging of doors, cupboards and drawers and hoovering. Not acceptable for a leisurely weekend break.
After speaking to duty manager, she explained that there was a quick turn around for incoming flight crews (American Airlines use hotel extensively). However given cost etc this routine should not be of detriment  to other guests. Went home very tired, not the leisure break we intended",1,2013,10,15
211,Very impressed and surprised,"I stayed here recently while attending a conference in Croke Park and I must say I was hugely Impressed by the staff, facilities, food and location. It really punches above its weight as they could easily rest on their laurels with the location but its great to see that the staff there take massive pride in their work to deliver a high level of service.

I would reccomend this Hotel for anyone either be it a city stay, going to a match/concert etc and very much for business. I Judge Hotels by their breakfast offering and this is what really impressed me with this Hotel, amazing choice of fresh food and yet again great service.",5,2013,10,14
211,Fantastic Staff,"I  booked this hotel for a night away with my wife to celebrate our 1st wedding anniversary. We got to the room and it was furnished nicely. The view wasnt fantastic but then who really sits at the window looking out for any longer than 2 minutes! Especially on an anniversary! We had a nice surprise when we had a knock on the door and a member of staff had two small bottles of bubbly and a card wishing us well on our anniversary! That was such a nice touch. Hotel was spot on. It was clean and comfy. Only downside was that the pillows werent fantastic. Free parking as well which is a bonus!

The staff really made this hotel. On checkout, we were offered complimentary bottles of water. Its all about the small touches!

Thanks guys.",5,2013,10,14
211,Bar Food availability,"We stayed in this hotel on friday 11 October, lovely rooms and friendly staff, however their policy that there is no bar food available after 9.30 pm pm borders on the ridiculous, this is a quality hotel in the capital city, 
We were told prior to our arrival that hot food was not available after 9.30pm but that cold food would not be a problem.
This had to be ordered through room service and the only food available was what was called the ""classic sandwich""
It really was what it said on the tin.
Will we be back only if our schedule will allow us to check in early, otherwise I don't think so",3,2013,10,14
211,"perfect hotel, brilliant staff","This was our second visit to Croke Park Hotel, on both occasions we were more than pleased with our room, the hotel's facilities and with the excellent staff. Great location, excellent meals, can't fault this place",5,2013,10,13
211,"Very nice, friendly hotel!","This was a wonderful hotel with very friendly service! Our only hiccup was their computers went down and our first night got overbooked. They gave us drinks and a cab ride over to a very nice hotel, then we came back for the last two nights.They then upgraded us to the executive suite which was very nice! The room was very roomy and comfortable although not enough light. But we found that the case in all the hotels we stayed in. The gals at the front desk were all very friendly and helpful! Parking was also easy and free. Not very close to anything, the stadium was across the street, but the Henry Street shopping was only a 15 minute walk. We would definitely stay again!",5,2013,10,13
211,Excellent hotel just a shame about location,"We couldn't fault the friendly service that we received when we arrived (and it was fairly easy to get to from airport on the Aircoach). Would have given a 5/5 except for the location. We were two girls and felt the need to get a taxi back from the city centre rather than the 15 min walk. There's even a shuttle bus for the green hop on hop off bus (so don't book the red one in advance like I did!). 

Continental breakfast was lovely - but note that there are not many other breakfast options in the area though. 

Thanks!",4,2013,10,13
211,Dublin's best hotel! ,"This hotel was a pleasure to stay at! The staff was very friendly and accommodating. The restaurant in the hotel had excellent food and the Irish Breakfast was amazing! If you are going to be in Dublin, this is the place to stay. It's about 1.5 miles to the sites of Trinity College and Temple Bar area. Which is close but not too close to the touristy areas. We will stay here again.",5,2013,10,13
211,Excellent,"Stayed here for a long weekend with friends. We experienced problems with our booking on arrival, not the Hotels fault, and the reception staff couldn't have been more helpful sorting it out. Throughout the whole stay all the staff were wonderful. The lady at breakfast reception remembered us on the second day, which was amazing! Kieran in the bar was so friendly and chatty it was like coming home at the end of a busy day!  
Got an amazing deal on the price and I'd definitely recommend it to everyone. Very roomy, comfortable bedrooms and a yummy cooked breakfast included in the price. The Guinness was cheaper here than in Temple Bar area but the Tea was dear!",5,2013,10,11
211,Great Hotel,"Stayed with friends here, what a great hotel. Nice people, location. Dublin is great too. Booked this through Asda Travel, who were fab and we couldn't believe price, a real deal. Will definitely stay here again, going to take hubby next time.",5,2013,10,09
211,Top class hotel,"Stayed here the weekend of the football All-Ireland. Fantastic location! Great customer service! Food is amazing if a little on the expensive side! However, three euro for a cup of tea is a bit much in anybody's book!!! I would definitely stay here again.",5,2013,10,08
211,Great hotel,My mum and I stayed here on the eve of the football All Ireland so the hotel was busy but we were very well looked after. The rooms have everything you could want and our evening meal in the bistro was lovely as was breakfast the following day. Krishna was really helpful throughout our stay as were all staff. Surprisingly after the match we were able to get a table in the restaurant without having made a booking and this was great as the bar was very packed and the restaurant was well staffed and relaxed away from the madness. The hotel does great value deals throughout the year and after our third stay we would still highly recommend it for comfort and craic if you like your GAA!,5,2013,10,07
211,Nice Stay,"My husband and I stayed here 3rd Oct for 1 night booked with Trivago £89 pounds B&B
The room was clean comfortable and modern. The bathroom was huge, the bed was nice the breakfast was really good. This hotel is 20mins walk from O'Connell street, we walked into the city and couldn't believe how run down the area is and how dirty the streets are, I would recommend getting a taxi- the taxi to O'Connell street cost 10 euro and 8 euros back to the hotel again -because of the 1 way system the return journey is shorter. I would only stay in this hotel again if I was visiting Croke Park Stat for a concert as this hotel is too far outside the centre for a city trip. The hotel bar is lovely with a good cocktail list great for chillin.",5,2013,10,07
211,First class!,"Stayed 3 nights, perfect service, nice room, great irish breakfast, 15min walk to the city - great value for money - strong buy! :-)

Use the 16 or 41 Bus from airport to drumcondra at 2,60euros + 5min walk!

Tourists: buy the ""green"" hop on hop off bus sightseeing ticket vor 16euro at the concierge (instead 18) in the hotel and even get it as shuttle to take you to town center!",5,2013,10,07
211,Absolutely wonderful hotel,"My short overnight stay in the Croke Park hotel in Dublin was absolutely excellent.  The staff and service was very, very good at all times and my room was so comfortable, clean and spacious. I loved the large bathroom with a similarly large walk-in shower on the left or bath on the right.  I chose to eat from the bar menu that evening.  The Seafood Chowder was superb just like the Oatie Fruit Crumble.  In fact I chose to have porridge for breakfast and that was simply luxurious.  The catering team is to be congratulated for their food. I was able to walk to the city-centre and back in about fifteen minutes.  If you arrive on the AirCoach, you get out at the first stop in the city.  I loved my brief stay at this hotel and am looking forward to returning in the not too distant future.",5,2013,10,06
211,"Excellent, once again.","We stayed at the Croke Park Hotel over the GAA final weekend. A really well handled experience. Over 80000 people attended the final with the hotel justy over the road, most ended up in the bar post match. The hotel had anticipated this with amazing foresight. Lots of security, 4-5 extra bars laid on to cope with the crowd. We didn't see anyone on the upper floors ,as is usual with these events, due to the card swipe lifts.
The hotel service was A1 and the Irish Breakfast was to die for, as much as you can eat with waitress service for the coffee,tea and toast. Rooms were very clean and fresh,clean towels laid on daily. 
We have stayed there twice before and every time they exceeded our expectations. Well done all at The Croke Park Hotel. Five stars!",5,2013,10,04
211,Not a happy camper,"I booked this hotel as I had a business meeting in Dublin. My husband and my 2 kids were coming with me so having stayed in The Croke Park Hotel previously I thought it would be convenient for them as they were heading to the Zoo for a day out. I telephoned the hotel to say we would be late arriving prob round 9. When we arrived at the hotel I gave the receptionist my details there was a lot of going over and back to the other receptionist. Then she asked me how many beds we needed, I said well u can see there are 4 of us so naturally we needed 4 places to sleep. The only room available with twin beds had a broken air con unit so we were not going to stay in this room. Then she said that they had a twin bed and single bed and they would make up a bed for us in the room. Eventually when the bed arrived you couldnt move in the room I kept hitting my shins off the make shift bed. Very very disappointed with this supposedly 4 star hotel will not be recommending to my colleagues... ",3,2013,10,01
211,Another great stay,"Spent a very enjoyable weekend at the hotel. Staff were very friendly and courteous, and despite the hotel being very busy they always took time to help us with any requests.  Lovely relaxing restaurant where the food was great and the staff very attentive. A modern hotel which is spotlessly clean. The hotel exudes a great atmosphere for it's guests.  Ideally located for Croke Park and a 20 minute leisurely walk to the city centre.",5,2013,09,30
211,Really fine hotel!,"Front desk staff was terrific in all our interactions.  The concierge, Krishna, especially helpful in letting us know which places to visit during our very short stay in Dublin and also, how to navigate the streets in order to be on our way to Limerick City.  Gorgeous room and quiet!  Easy 15 minute walk to city center and attractions.  Food is fine, but service was a little slow.  Parking is on-site and really easy to get in and out.  We had an excellent stay overall!",4,2013,09,30
211,An Excellent Stay,"We spent 2 nights there recently and thoroughly enjoyed it. The rooms were ample, high tech and clean. In room wi fi worked well, and the beds were comfortable. Breakfast was delicious. Only downside was location (unless you were attending an event at the adjacent Croke Parke Stadium), but chalk up the 15 minute walk to O'Connell St. and the hop on hop off bus as good exercise to help work off a good meal.",5,2013,09,29
211,Great stay!,"Wonderful hotel.would have been perfect if it wasn't for the location.

Hotel itself is fantastic,great facilities,clean,helpful staff and amazing breakfast!free wifi thrown in which is always helpful and a noon check out time

Only draw back is location.it takes 15mins to walk to city centre which is fine during the day however at night would be worthwhile getting a taxi as area around hotel does not appear to be the best!

Overall it's a great hotel where I had a great and enjoyable stay",4,2013,09,27
211,PhilandJane2013,"On arrival at the Croke Park Hotel we were stressed and tired after a horrible flight experience and no luggage-it was still in LHR. The staff were brilliant offering us an upgrade to the executive floor, tooth brush and toiletries and anything else they could. The room was extremely comfortable with good facilities - the executive lounge is a brilliant idea. After our stay we left relaxed, well fed and would recommend them to anyone.",5,2013,09,26
211,beautiful,"lovely hotel, vrey busy on match days.  only fault i could find was the breakfast on both mornings, was too busy and not enough staff on.  but overall thoroughly enjoyed stay here and will definately be back",4,2013,09,25
211,Excellent Hotel..,"Excellent hotel; free parking; good food; efficient and pleasant service & reasonable prices; really nice rooms and extremely handy if going to Croke Park for match or conference, but just don't go wandering about outside after dark on your own.. (My opinion only - there are dodgy spots in every City but suggest u grab a cab if heading to/from town.. No bother during the day..)",5,2013,09,25
211,Amazing stay,"I recently stayed in the Croke Park Hotel for two nights. The staff are very friendly and helpful, and went out of their way to make our stay even better (it was a special occasion). The hotel is very modern and fresh, and the rooms are immaculate.

We stayed on the fourth floor which includes access to the Executive Lounge, where we had drinks and snacks during the day as well as a comfortable seating area.

The room included a bath and a separate shower, and there were tea and coffee making facilities. The bed was the most comfortable bed I have ever experienced in a hotel! 

Location was fine as well, it was about a 30 minute walk to town and less than 20 euros in a taxi. 

I would highly recommend the Croke Park Hotel, and I would definitely stay there again.",5,2013,09,24
211,Delightful,Staying here on business. I was greeted by everyone in the staff with a smile and good morning and it hello. The breakfast buffet was nice and they had tasty fruits and various spreads. This hotel is only a mile away from temple bar and Christ church cathedral. Quite convenient and I slept pretty well in the room. My room had a shower and a tub to the right. Rooms come with coffee and tea which was nice. I would recommend to any friends. ,5,2013,09,24
211,A&D,"Stayed in the croke park hotel Saturday and Sunday night had a great time, hotel spotless from you enter staff on reception were all very pleasant and went out of there way to help you, check in very speedy, we were on the 2nd floor overlooking croke park stadium,we had a large room with 2 double beds with a good sized bathroom with bath and a walk in shower which was great. hotel only a 20min walk into city centre, we had a meal in the dinning room the food was excellent and also a great choice for breakfast, would really recommend this hotel",5,2013,09,23
211,Wonderful stay from beginning till the end,"We stayed in this hotel last week. It was a short-notice booking and did not know what to expect. But as soon as you go in, you will realise that this hotel is a top-quality one. Check-in was very fast. All people at reception, including receptionists, concierge etc. were always nice and pleasant and very helpful. Hotel room was really comfortable - large beds, comfortable pillows, comfortable bathroom (with both a bath and a shower), tea-coffee making facilities, free WIFI, no noises from other rooms. Room was always impeccably clean. We haven't been to such a secure hotel before - to use the lift for example you need the room card. We were staying on the top floor which gave us right to the executive lounge 24hours, this gave us the right to avail ourselves to a number of perks such as free cappuccinos, teas, biscuits, newspapers, magazines, etc. Well, this is definitely a hotel to recommend to others, and we will definitely use it again should we return to beautiful city of Dublin.",5,2013,09,22
211,Pleasant stay,"Very nice hotel. Room was neat, clean, quiet and just perfect. This was a mystery hotel from last minute.com and we were very happy with it.
It is not central to Dublin - we walked in (app 30 mins) and grabbed a taxi (sub €10) back to the hotel. But I would still stay again.",4,2013,09,21
211,"Great early booking rates, wonderful rooms and staff","We booked a twin room, breakfast included for 109 euro.  Check in was a bit lengthy but the staff were lovely, the rooms were perfect and the price amazing.  Location is perfect and there's free parking for residents.  It's directly across the road from the Croke park stadium so I would strongly recommend it if going to Croke Park.  The location is also perfect for Drumcondra and close enough to the City Centre to either walk if fit and not wearing heels or you could bus or taxi for a very reasonable fare.  All in all, you can't fault it - well maybe the lack of grilled tomatoes at breakfast?  Seriously though the breakfast selection is perfect.",5,2013,09,21
211,Great Hotel! Location not superb.,"Stayed at The Croke Park during the August Bank Holiday weekend for 3 nights. Elegant hotel in a not so elegant neighborhood. Clean, well-appointed and extremely spacious rooms and bathrooms. Tasty and good quality breakfast buffet . Service from the reception staff was not always top-notch, but OK overall. Parnell Street is a good 15-min walk, but Dublin Bus Tours (shuttle to the city center) stop outside the hotel every 15-20 mins in the morning.",4,2013,09,21
211,Loved it!,"My husband and I stayed here for over a week while on our honeymoon in Ireland.  We could not have asked for a better experience!  The staff was so friendly and helped us with directions and ordering early-morning taxis for our tours.  The hotel was clean and quiet- which is a nice change of pace from the busy hotels near Temple Bar.  The hotel restaurant and bar had great service and excellent food.  While it is a bit of a walk during the day to get to midtown, it is totally doable.  The cabs are easy to get at night, both to and from the hotel and are very, fairly priced.

We can't wait to come back!",5,2013,09,20
211,Great Hotel-fair location,"We stayed 2 nights at the Croke before and after our tour of Ireland.  Great staff, good food and very clean.  Halfway between the airport and city center.  The neighborhood is changing so be careful walking at night.  The Croke Park stadium is in front of the hotel which makes it perfect for attending events.",5,2013,09,19
211,Hotel with class,"Stayed in the Croke park Hotel August Bank holiday for 3 nights.  We choose this Hotel as we were going to the Donegal V Mayo football match and it is just across road.  Car parking is free which is great, but is limited when the Hotel is busy.   We found the staff brilliant, answering any queries and nothing been a problem.  They treated our 2 kids (aged 3 & 7) as respected guests and made them feel so welcome and at ease to ask staff anything.  We ate lunch and dinner in the Hotel and the quality of the food was excellent.   The Hotel provide hot towels on arrival and Bottled water on departure, which may not sound like much but gave this Hotel that little bit of class.  We will def be back",5,2013,09,18
211,Very nice,Stayed at Croke Park the last night in Dublin.  Very modern hotel that is across the street from the stadium.  Well appointed room and bath.  We had to leave early for our flight and they provided a box breakfast since our rate included breakfast.  Would defenitely recommend this hotel.,5,2013,09,17
211,Perfect example on how to do hotels the right way!,This is a nice new building. Everything well thought out and planned. Big well appointed rooms. Comfy beds. Big bathrooms with good shower. Breakfast is great. Good bar area with comfy seating.  Good gym.  Staff friendly and helpful. Can't fault this hotel in any way. Even the lifts always seemed to either be ready for you or arrive very quickly. ,4,2013,09,17
211,"This is a clean, comfortable hotel","I stayed in the hotel on business and was very happy with the property. The location is some distance from the center of Dublin, but the walk into town was not bad at all. I stayed on the executive floor, which was worth the extra expense. The hotel staff is very friendly and helpful and I would certainly stay here again.",4,2013,09,17
211,We enjoyed our stay very much!,"We just stayed here in September 2013 and enjoyed it very much.  While it is away from the true downtown area, we could take the shuttle to hop on off bus (BTW highly recommended) but we also just walked downtown.  It is not very far.  

Bathrooms are fabulous, the shower is great too.the food is great, the waitstaff are great and concierge was (3 separate ones) were all very helpful.  We stayed here are part of a package deal we got and were very happy with everything.  We stayed out in the Temple Bar area one night and took a cab back so it was no big deal to not be in the thick of things.  It is a quiet area of the city too.",5,2013,09,16
211,Some good-some bad,"Good-rooms and breakfast 

Bad- location Is too far from town with no shuttles and area looks and feels unsafe in the evening.

Front desk service -We had same problem with them assisting us with contacting airport luggage department as previous reviewer.We were confused with the UK phone numbers we had.",3,2013,09,16
211,Amazing hotel to Stay!!,"This hotel is amazing, first the staff is the friendliest you would come across, and then the rooms are really nice and clean, Huge Bathrooms compared with others in dublin.!
But the best part is the location of this Hotel, its right across from Croke Park stadium and if you happen to be there when a game is on, its the best place to me, that is if you like to interact with people and can handle crowds...
We arrived early @5 Am, but the hotel staff got us a room by 7 and got us a continental breakfast as well.
Did everything to make us comfortable, till we got the room.
5 stars to all !",5,2013,09,15
211,Not impressed!,"We  are here right now and not impressed.
The room was fine  but do not sit on bed as they move quickly as you sit down as on rollers.The breakfast was very good but that is about all.Prices for food is not cheap-regular Fish and chips are 15 euros
You are stuck away from town with no shuttles or regular bus service.The hop on hop off bus has a pickup here if you buy their ticket but they do not go much past 6pm.
Walking at night is not recommended unless with large group.
So no pool,no entertainment and away from town.They do have a nice free library though.
Asked front desk to use phone when we arrived or have them call airlines as airlines needed hotel info which we did not have to deliver our luggage.They refused and told us to give them our credit card and phone from room.",3,2013,09,15
211,"Lovely, comfortable room. Quiet location for restful sleep.",Nice spacious room. Bathroom lovely. Very clean overall. Concierge very helpful pointing out bus route & stops. Very nice extensive breakfast - good coffee which we have found uncommon in Ireland overall. Just far enough away from business of city for a restful sleep which we enjoyed. Very pleased overall w/stay.,5,2013,09,15
211,Nice City Hotel,"The Croke Park Hotel is in a quiet area of Dublin....across the street from the Croke Park Stadium.  During sporting events, imagine it wouldn't be that quiet.  However, employees of the hotel very helpful and friendly.  Rooms very nicely appointed, baths fabulous.  Easy 15 minute walk to hub of Dublin to see the sights.",4,2013,09,13
211,Loved this hotel,"I stayed in this Hotel in July & booked through the Doyle Collection website.  I booked this hotel at a great rate which included car parking & breakfast for my partner & I and also a late check out which also suited us.  
From the moment we stepped out of the elevator from the car park into the lobby we were very pleased.  The staff were so friendly and couldn't be more helpful & I just loved the atmosphere in the hotel. Our room was large and so clean with air con a huge bathroom and there was absolutely no noise from any of the other rooms or hallway so we had a great nights sleep after a few lovely drinks in the nice bar downstairs. 
I had originally booked this hotel as I had a meeting the following day in Croke Park (which is right across the road also) and it was more for convenience at the time.  A great choice in the end.  
I would of loved to have stayed for a few more nights as I enjoyed it so much so I intend on visiting this hotel very soon again and I'm looking forward to my return trip.  
Compliments to the staff of this hotel on doing a great job on delivering an excellent customer service & experience.",5,2013,09,11
211,"Decent hotel, good concierge service","We stayed one night, September 9th at this hotel.  The room was adequate but not spectacular.  The view from the window was over a garage and was fairly unattractive.  We ate lunch there and found it fairly bland.  What was very good was the concierge service.  Recommendations and directions for dinner were spot on.  The location, across from Croke Park Stadium is less than inspiring.  Don't think I would stay here again as it's a bit of a walk to the main tourist area.",4,2013,09,11
211,Excellent hotel,"We stayed int the Croke Park Hotel at the end of a tour of Ireland.  A major athletic event was taking place the afternoon we checked in.  The staff was prepared and handled the huge crowd coming out of the stadium well.  The rooms were very nice, air conditioned and well maintained.  The staff was very helpful and assisted us with an very early morning transfer to the airport the day of our departure.",5,2013,09,10
211,horrible bathroom,"Stayed at The Croke Park on the 5th September 2013.Lengthy check in process where an upgrade was offered for extra payment and accepted.Whilst the room was adequate,I found it strange that the wardrobe hanging space would take nothing longer than a shirt/top so anything longer had to be hung on a chair .The bathroom was horrible ! The design inspiration seemed to be hospital / public swimming pool.It was obviously a room with disabled facilities. Had I been disabled I might have been grateful that the bathroom was wheelchair accessable but depressed by the municipal décor and frustrated by the fact that I wouldn't have been able to reach the towels.As I am not disabled I found the lack of a bath disappointing ,paying extra for an upgrade and losing a basic facility doesn't seem to equate. My brother mentioned these grievances to the person on reception and was told "" Oh some of the rooms are like that "" I knew that, I was in one ! When checking out I told the lady on reception again about my concerns she said that she didn't know how it happened,this was the person who had checked us in and offered the upgrade.I would have thought that if your job is allocating rooms then a knowledge of facilities in said rooms would be a pre-requisite.On a more  positive note , the food is excellent !",3,2013,09,09
211,Fabulous Service,"A group of friends and I came for a short celebratory break in Dublin. I booked the Croke Park after reading the very favourable reviews on Tripadvisor .The hotel however exceeded our expectations . Alot of thought and effort had been made by the staff in making our stay a very memorable one; all of our rooms were located close by; we were allowed to check in early and have access to the Executive Lounge whilst waiting for housekeeping to service our rooms; all staff were courteous, cheerful and helpful. Infact nothing was too much trouble. The staff certainly seemed keen to go the extra mile in customer services. Breakfast was a full Irish and enjoyed by us all. We used the Hop On Hop Off Bus service from the hotel and had a thoroughly great trip. 
Thanks to all the staff at the Croke Park!",5,2013,09,09
211,"Excellent customer service, comfortable modern hotel","We arrived at the Hotel at around 11am even though check in was at 1400  as we had an early flight. Me and my boyfriend had our suitcases and one of the staff member said he will check to see if there were any rooms available now. There was one and said we could have the room now so we can put our suitcases in and then enjoy the rest of our day in Dublin. Excellent customer service! the room was clean, presented well and the bed was comfortable. The room and en suite was very spacious The breakfast was very tasty.There was the continental and the full which had an excellent selection. The hotel was in a good location 10-15 minutes away from the city centre and Croke Park stadium was opposite. Me and my boyfriend really enjoyed our stay and we would come back if we were to go back to Dublin.",5,2013,09,08
211,"Nice hotel, great full Irish breakfast","The rooms are very nice, modern, clean, with all the amenities one expects. The staff are all very gracious and helpful. The Irish full breakfast the hotel offers is a feast of everything you can possibly want for breakfast when in Ireland. It is served in a lovely setting and the wait staff is incredibly fast and attentive. The location of the hotel may seem a bit bland, but it is not far to walk to the more popular nearby areas of Henry Street, Temple Bar, Ha-Penny Bridge, etc.",4,2013,09,06
211,nice comfortable hotel for family,"Room was spacious with a large en-suite bathroom. Very clean and offers enough comfort for a family with children. People can take sightseeing bus from the hotel or just walk about 10 minutes to city centre. Our 3 y.o daughter inadvertanly throw the bedside lamp, and we asked the cleaning room service to help us cleaning the mess. The staff was friendly and very helpfull. Underground parking and wifi are available as well.",5,2013,09,06
211,Comfortable Stay,"Hotel was clean, modern, and extremely comfortable.  Staff were friendly and helpful.  Hotel bar was very nice and wonderful service.  We did not partake in the breakfast so I cannot comment on that.  My only caveat has nothing to do with the hotel itself.  If you are traveling with younger children who cannot walk miles a day do not rely on the city buses from this neighborhood to get you places.  Only one bus stops close and while it does take you down to Temple Bar area and Trinity college you will have to take another bus to get anywhere else.  Pay for the 'Hop on/Hop off' bus system that goes around Dublin, it will be worth it if you are staying in Croke Park.",5,2013,09,06
211,Superb Hotel,"We stayed at the Croke Park hotel in November 2012 and found it to be a superb experience. We went on a Travelzoo deal and we were not disappointed. The staff were attentive, food very good.The spacious double room with large bathroom en-suite excellent.We had access to the executive lounge,which was very good too! On return to England I booked to return via Travel Republic in October 2013 and am counting the days!..Highly recommended.",5,2013,09,04
211,Great modern hotel,"I have stayed in a few different hotels throughout Dublin and this one was the best in terms of room and service quality. The rooms have all the modern amenities as well as a pleasant, clean design. They were well-maintained and had good air conditioning and no exposure to outside noise. The staff was friendly and answered my questions, gave me good directions to walk to the center of town, etc... The breakfast buffet in the restaurant was great and had lots of different options, especially for those who are in the mood for a traditional Irish breakfast fry-up. It is not in the center of town but a nice 20 minute walk will get you to the heart of the O'Connell Street shopping area. I'd definitely stay here again if I came back to Dublin.",5,2013,09,03
211,Great place to stay!,"My husband booked this hotel as a surprise for our wedding anniversary,  where we stayed for two nights. We were greeted by very friendly staff on our arrival and although it was mid morning out room was ready so we could check in and dump our bags ready to explore Dublin!  The hotel is very modern and clean the rooms are of a really good size which are nicely decorated, the bathroom is huge with both a separate shower and full size bath tub should you want to have a long soak after all that sight seeing! Again very modern and spotlessly clean!! The facilities are good the bar area offers snacks and light meals, newspapers and a huge TV which is situated at one end with comfy sofas for you to relax and enjoy, which we did before setting off to Temple bar area! 
Drink prices at the hotel bar were good and what we expected we felt that they were in line with London prices so not out of the way. Breakfast was of a good standard with plenty of choice for even the fussiest of eaters! Location- may not be the greatest it is right opposite Croke park which on a match day could be rather noisy! Also it is a  20 min walk to O'connell street but it is ok just turn right out of the hotel and go straight past five sets of lights and your there! We didn't mind the walk and found it quite enjoyable to look at all the different shops on the way down, not so good after sampling many a pint of Dublin's finest Guinness! Really good hotel with great staff would defiantly return and will happily recommend The Croke Park Hotel if your looking for a good hotel in Dublin. ",5,2013,09,03
211,You won't be disappointed if you keep a few things in mind.,"Nice hotel with clean spacious rooms. 
You will be given the option of having continental breakfast included in your room charge. We chose not to have it included, but did go down for breakfast on a few of the mornings. Be prepared, if you didn't opt to have breakfast included, the staff at the restaurant will be confused about why you have shown up for breakfast! Rest assured, you can still have breakfast, just tell them you want to have it charged for the room and be clear about whether you want the full irish breakfast or the continental. They may ask you to sign for the charge or they may not. It seems that the staff don't have any rules about how this is too be done. 
Service in the restaurant and bar were very dependent on who is working. One morning at breakfast we were entirely ignored after being seated and not brought any coffee or tea, while on another morning with a different server, the coffee and toast was brought almost immediately. Same thing in the bar for the evenings. Either we got very good service or almost none at all. 
You made read a lot of reviews on this site talking about the LOCATION of this hotel. Be aware that this hotel is NOT ""city centre"" but in fairness it never claims to be. It is on the north side, directly across from the Croke Park Stadium. I suggest checking to see whether there is a match at the stadium during your stay before you book this hotel. This hotel is very busy during a match and can get ""rowdy"". The neighborhood around the hotel is sketchy. I wouldn't advise going for evening walks in the area, but during the day it's fine. To walk to O'Connell street will take about 20 minutes. 
Regarding taxi travel from this hotel to the city centre - it is not 10euros each way, regardless of what the hotel staff may tell you. The base fare may be 10euros but remember to add 1 euro for each additional person in the taxi and also add another 2 euro if the hotel calls for the cab for you because that is considered a ""booked fare"" and incurs an extra charge. In total for 2 people we found the fare to get to city Centre was usually at least 13 euro for to travel for the hotel to city center. 
All in all, we found this a good place to stay. It suited our needs and the positives outweighed the negatives. Just remember that if you want a ""city centre"" location in the heart of the action that is only a few minutes walk to everything then this is not for you.  ",4,2013,09,01
211,Overall very good would recommend and stay again,"Stayed for just one night with my two young children. Booked a well priced special offer that included access to the Executive Lounge. The hotel is very attractively presented and the staff are lovely. We were offered a complimentary drink in the bar as only water and tea/coffee appears to be available in the executive lounge in the evening.
Lovely atmosphere in the lounge bar.
Room excellent,  sleep quality amazing.
The reason I haven't given 5 stars is breakfast experience in the executive lounge. There were two hotel guests wearing pyjama bottoms and one barefooted. Previous lounges I have experienced are always properly staffed and this wasn't the case the morning we visited. Apart from having to eat breakfast with people inappropriately dressed there were issues with the food too.
The staff member on duty was only there for a short time. The coffee machine broke and when it was fixed served the worst coffee I have tasted in a long time. The machine was also dirty with milk and water splashes.
The choice of breakfast buffet was adequate but the celery alongside the cheese board was brown and stale looking. The ham and salmon platter were not covered or kept cool and the crockery and pastries ran out.
Despite this I would stay again as this hotel seems committed to customer service and taking on board constructive criticism",4,2013,08,28
211,Pure comfort,"We stayed at the Croke Park Hotel, in mid August this year, we were only there for one night but it was a great night. My party consisted of my wife, two children and myself. we had pre booked our stay back in May, as we needed the hotel to be near the Dublin ferry Port for the early morning crossing to Holyhead, it is only a 15 min drive to the port so is ideal. We were greeted by very friendly staff on arrival and the welcoming hot towel was a joy after a three and a half hour drive. We were upgraded to a suite that was extremely comfortable and well equiped we also had free use of the 4th floor facilities. The bar was spacious and comfortable and the service first rate. We had dinner in the Bistro restaurant, the food was extremely good and for a hotel was good value 94 Euros for four people which included two courses wine and soft drinks. the breakfast the next day was self service and the variety on offere was excellent everything was catered for from fruit to full Irish tea coffee juices etc there was even a selection of cold cuts and various breads. The whole experiance was worth it and I think good value our room was a superior room costing 179 euros for four people.(what I liked was that we were charged for the room and not per person as in some hotels in England) i would definetly stay here again and would recommend the Croke Park to anyone, just dont book in on a GAA Finals weekend as it will get very busy.",5,2013,08,28
211,Good hotel,"Reception staff were friendly and helpful on arrival.  Room was spacious, clean and bed was very comfortable.  Bar staff were attentive and service for bar snack and drinks was quick.  Breakfast offered a good choice.  Would definitely recommend and will book hotel again on my next trip.",4,2013,08,27
211,Rip-off,"Overpriced to stay, eat & drink. 20 min walk from city centre. We were upgraded to another room & were told that breakfast was included only to be told the following morning that 'continental' breakfast was included in price, not full Irish. Scandalous price of €15.....",1,2013,08,27
211,We loved it and we will come again,"The staff were very nice and helpful. 
The room has newest electronic devices. The beds are very comfortble. 
Breakfast was OK. 
A taxi driver gave us his tip; not to walk at night alone near the hotel. At day time - no problem at all. ",5,2013,08,26
211,Nice folks work here,"I was always quite impressed with the service at the front desk here. It is obvious the hotel is well staffed and managed. As previously noted by other reviewers it is not exactly ""centrally located"". However given the more reasonable prices here I found this tradeoff to be worth it. It's perhaps a 20 minute walk to the bottom of O'Connell street, 25 to Trinity College.   Also there is a hop off hop on shuttle that leaves from the hotel every morning to O'Connell street The hotel gets a discount on tickets for the hop on hop off tour as well, if that's your thing. 
Noticed a lot of people complained about the area. I'd say you 'd have to have pretty thin skin to be scared of this area but maybe my urban experiences have toughened me up?",5,2013,08,25
211,Enjoyable Stay,"This is a lovely modern hotel, and although not centrally located is only about a 20 minute walk to the centre of Dublin.  The room and bathroom were very nice and immaculately clean.  We did have a couple of problems  (bathroom door not shutting properly and shower leaking), but it didn't bother us enough to complain.  Breakfast was very good with a wide selection of cold and hot food.  The staff were very friendly especially in the restaurant.  This was the second hotel in the Doyle Collection which we stayed in during our tour of the Republic of Ireland and were certainly very impressed.  Little things like hot towels at check in and bottles of water at check out were appreciated. There is a large free car park.    Worth checking partner sites for special rates.",4,2013,08,24
211,Lovely Hotel,"I stayed here overnight with my children. The hotel is beautiful, rooms lovely and spotlessly clean, and the deal we got included hop on, hop off bus tickets.The breakfast was fabulous with a great selection. There were a few nice touches such as hot towels on arrival and bottled water on checking out.  It is certainly the perfect location if you are in Dublin for an event in the Croke Park stadium.

The bus tickets are great if you want to travel around to see the city. Travelers might want to note that the nearest bus stop to the hotel is a good twenty minute walk away and not on the flat. The bus service also stops quite early in the evening so check the timetables. We were also advised by a bus driver not to walk back to the hotel too late at night and I would agree with that - best to get a taxi. 

I would certainly recommend this hotel and with a concert coming up next year would plan to stay here again.",4,2013,08,23
211,Worse place I've ever stayed!,"My boyfriend and I stood there for 6 nights and 7 days. It was by far the worst experience we've ever had at a hotel. The staff were extremely rude and not accomidatimng.Although it is a very beautful place to stay it's NOT worth the money. I have stories upon stories about the horribe experinece we had. It's also about a 20 min.  walk to the city center and the hotel is in a very bad area so at night you have to cab it back whch cost 10 euros it was just insane. I don't recommend anyone to ever stay there it was way too expensive, they have a restaurant as well which was way overpriced. Honestly have no idea why they have good reviews. It got to the point where my boyfriend and I tried to leave but we signed a contract so couldn't check out.",1,2013,08,23
211,Amazing overall,"I stayed here with my boyfriend in July for a concert at phoneix park, the staff where more than helpful at the reception and the bar! The rooms where amazing,big and clean! The location was fantastic..10 min walk to grafton street! Overall fantastic experience, so much when we came home and booked straight away for end of August ",5,2013,08,22
211,Amazing hotel!!,"This was out third visit to the hotel, our first time with our daughter and it was fabulous as always. Efficient check in with attentive staff. Room was superb, extremely spacious and the beds were so comfortable. Breakfast fantastic as always, a great choice and excellent service. Nice surprise of some fizz in our room for our anniversary, a lovely touch by management. Our daughter loved her stay and even left the staff a letter on her pillow on departure :-) all in all a Wonderful hotel, ten minute walk from grafton street, wonderful staff and amazing service. Will definitely be back!! ",5,2013,08,20
211,"Clean rooms, below par service","The hotel is in between the airport and center of town so by location it is good. We stayed in a family room - 2 adults and 2 children and the room and bathroom were nice - clean and pleasant.  However, when we tried to order room service, they wouldn't pick up the phone - after trying for 10 mins, we called reception and they would just put us through to the same connection.  Eventually, I had to get a little stern with Reception and they were apologetic, took our order and room service was delivered.  On the plus, we had ordered aloo tikki, veg samosas which were quite tasty.
We went out for the evening (left a sign to make up room) to come back to no turn down service (maybe I ask too much customer service?) but they had not even taken the tray of dishes remaining from the snacks! 
Upon checkout when I was asked how my stay was - they seemed uninterested in hearing actual feedback.
So in summary, room was nice, breakfast and service there was good and Reception were on the whole - helpful.  Room service and housekeeping need a revamp or a few improvements.",3,2013,08,20
211,such a delight of a hotel,"This hotel has the most amazing staff where 
the motto is everything is possible. Food is excellent choice is quiet good downside service a little slow, this doesn't really matter unless you are in hurry.",4,2013,08,19
211,Wonderful Hotel,"We really enjoyed our stay at the Croke. The rooms were very clean, a nice size, large bathroom and the breakfast buffet was a nice mix of hot and cold items. The staff were very helpful and very nice. 

The hotel is located across the street from the Croke arena and about 5 minutes from the downtown area via taxi.

We would definitely stay here again.",4,2013,08,19
211,Cracking Croke!,"A wonderful hotel; staff are a credit to their employers. We were celebrating our 5th wedding anniversary and were upgraded; they also threw in some sparkling wine on arrival in our room. It's out of town a little but it was a pleasant walk. There are taxis of course which reception will book for you. The green bus picks up at the hotel in the mornings and this is great value.Can't praise this place enough, thank you for a fantastic Irish experience.",5,2013,08,15
211,Loved Croke!,"We stayed at Croke Park for one night, but wished we could have stayed longer! It was a little outside of downtown (prob. 15 min. walk) but nice to be in a quieter section. The hotel is right across the street from Croke Park (sports arena) which was cool. The hotel is very modern and our room was beautiful. Everything was clean and they even offered hot towels when we checked in! No pool but a nice fitness center. Free internet in your room. We ate breakfast and dinner there and they were very accommodating with gluten free. If you stay here, check out Koh Thai in downtown. Amazing food and great for GF people. Love Croke Park and would stay here again in a second!",5,2013,08,13
211,Pleasant stay,"This was the only hotel available with suitable accomodations on short notice; typically, our stay is always in city center at a luxury hotel.  The Croke Hotel is definitely a business hotel, busy!  The rooms are average business decor, clean, and sufficiently comfortable.  The most positive aspect, however, is the friendliness of all the staff.  Although, several discrepancies in service were that in spite of all the staff's willingness to assist, some things were overlooked during our stay.  Such as, forgetting to get toast to our two rooms; not setting up our credit card information to view pay-per-view movies; not answering the front phones to find out the reason that we could not order movies forcing us twice to make our way downstairs to rectify the situation along with a necessary phone call to remind them to set up our movie options, after a long wait to speak with a front desk member.  In spite of all this, extremely pleasant staff!",4,2013,08,12
211,Fabulous hotel would recommend,"We stayed here last week for 3 nights, we were upgraded by the hotel as awe were celebrating our daughters 21st birthday and the hotel also gave us complimentary sparkling wine in the room.
The room was spacious and clean, the hotel staff were attentive and friendly.
The bar and restaurant served a good selection of food and drink. We would recommend",5,2013,08,12
211,"Excellent hotel - location is best for sports, not tourists","I really have no complaints for this hotel. Very modern, very clean, great service, free Internet, working air conditioning, comfortable beds and linens....definitely one of the better hotels I have seen in Ireland. The location is just not ideal for tourists.  It takes a while to hike to the tourist bus stops, shopping or most restaurants.  Why?  It is right next to the big sports stadium in Dublin.  In the end, it is a great choice as a close tourist spot is not your priority.",5,2013,08,12
211,One night stay,"We stayed in croke park hotel saturday 10th august for one night. Quick check in, helpful staff who ordered us taxis- which were also so quick and reliable! Rooms were immacutley clean, comfy bed and lovely bathroom.  Drinks abit pricey in the bar but otherwise a nice hotel.  ",4,2013,08,12
211,Exceptional for a busy city hotel,"This is a most impressive establishment, from the refreshing towel at the check in to the bottled water at check out.  Attention to detail in a very service oriented establishment with nice rooms, a fie bar and good food is what this hotel s about.",5,2013,08,10
211,Would go back tomorrow if I could.,"My boyfriend and I stayed here for two nights in March. We were on the executive floor(4th) which has access to free bottled water, coffee machine, daily papers, fresh fruit and a balcony looking at Croke park. 
The room was a decent size and the bathroom was very modern and clean. 
We ate at the hotel both nights, the food was lovely both times and service was excellent! 
There is free underground parking for hotel guests. 

I cannot fault the hotel or its staff however a swimming pool/jacuzzi would finish this to the highest possible standard. ",5,2013,08,10
211,Fabulous we'll be back,This hotel is great the staff are brilliant so helpful food was great and the room was brilliant. Easy access to Dublin we were at the Dublin show which was easy to use the dart system to get to. All in all they made our stay a great one. ,5,2013,08,10
211,Perfect,"I can't sing this hotel's praises enough. I originally booked one night here, but loved it so much that I booked it again for my return trip to Dublin before I departed. The rooms were very large, the beds huge and extremely comfortable, and the bathrooms were spotless and had a separate shower and large bath. If you are on the fourth floor, you have access to the executive suite, which provides coffee, water, and cookies throughout the day and a very nice breakfast in the morning. It also has a fireplace and is a great area to hang out and relax. Their fitness center is large and beautiful! And the staff is so courteous and helpful. I hope to stay here again if I'm ever lucky enough to return to Dublin!",5,2013,08,08
211,Impressive place to stay,"Stayed for a extended 6 day Dublin visit.

Biggest assest for this hotel..... Staff .... hands down winners when it came to helpfulness and service. Front desk and conciege staff ... the front of house and first people you meet on arrival area credit to this hotel. Housekeeping..... thanks to you for the room being kept clean and tidy for me and the turn down service for the Superior rooms.... say no more.
Overall, Dublin is a expensive place to stay and the prices for meals in the Sideline Bistro or Sideline Bar are very much inline with local prices for a decent meal.... many City centre coffee shops and restaurants charged far higher for less quality and quantity.

Access to the Ex. Lounge was nice and a quieter place for buffet breakfast in the morning.... 

A few negative (ish) points....

Please post the local bus routes, and stops for the hotel. For a casual, short stop user it would be extremely useful infomation. The walk into the City centre is do-able but navigating around the piles of street dumped rubbish on the way down to the top of O'Connel street is not for the faint hearted on a warm Summer morning.

CHECK match dates don't clash with your stay if you have very young children, are on a romantic weekend away or a more elderly client... that frankly likes it a little more on the sedate, quiet side. I've checked the ""Offical website"" and no mention is made that the entire groundfloor public areas of this hotel become a huge bar area pre and very much post match. I myself attended the match on the Saturday but come 10 pm the constant hum of the drinking crowd became a grind.... I was on the top floor !!  Sunday.... no chance of getting near a bar and the Bistro...... full. It was suggested that I use room service ... but a tray charge of 5 Euro a time seemed a bit rich for the effort. Being asked to use a side entrance to enter the hotel by a temp. Security guard did not bode well... especially when I refused.
 
Local transport into and out of the hotel is also effected when big matches are on, especially post match, so bear in mind for airport transfer planning. Basically NO taxis or even if you hire a vehicle locally... no dice...... the local Police (Garda) shut some of the roads around the area to assist with getting a 70,000+ crowd in or away from the area quickly.

Would I stay again.... absolutely. One of the best I've stayed at in the past 10 years and I'm already booked in for a Sister hotel in Boston !!!

Thanks everyone",5,2013,08,08
211,"Fab hotel, great value and location with very helpful staff","Stayed just one night as a family pity not any longer. Car wouldn't fit in garage as roof box on so helpful concierge Christopher showed us to a bus area. Later he suggested the Croke Park tour for kids as I had some business following am. They loved even my wife was impressed by tour and hotel. Had dinner that evening, could,mix bar food and restaurant which was v good for the price. Swordfish was delicious if not quite as good as one on beach in Ghana I had previously. 
Only regret - didn't tip Christopher as not on duty when leaving following am. Great value. Lifts to,rooms bit of a pain with card swipe but can appreciate safety and security. Will return when in Dublin,",5,2013,08,07
211,Very nice hotel next to stadium,"We stayed over the QF weekend which was fortunately as we hadnt planned this. We ended up going for yhe Dublin game which was lots of fun! The hotel is really nice and modern, the rooms were large and clean and we got vouchers for breakfast for €10 which is worth is as there isn't that much for breakfast nearby. It's a 20min walk or so to the city which isn't too bad. During the weekend the hotel was PACKED with people havin drinks at the bar and lobby, making things a little chaotic. However the staff handled the situation very well and there was always someone to help you get served at reception. Also breakfast got very busy after 9:30am so it was lucky that we woke up early! There isn't much directly around the hotel except for the stadium which is why I scored lower on location, also it was a long weekend and with the games being on everything seemed a bit dearer than usual... Oh yes one more thing the shower didnt seem to stop the water leaking through but it wasn't so as long as you put a towel out. ",5,2013,08,05
211,Lovely hotel,"My boyfriend and I stayed here for 3 nights while we visited Dublin. As stated by other reviewers, the area in which the hotel is situated doesn't inspire much confidence. However, once you go for a walk around it doesn't seem too bad. 

The welcome we received at reception was professional and friendly, it was a great first impression. We booked the superior room, and it was just that. The room was lovely and clean and had all the facilities you would expect such as tea and coffee, toiletries and local area guides. The bed was huge and very, very comfortable. There was an ice machine down the corridor and a fridge in the room. The only flaw with the room was that the shower cubicle didn't seem to seal properly around the door and leaked water all over the floor when in use, but we managed to wedge some towels against it and seemed to help. 

The view from the room wasn't the best, but that's a very minor point. The area looked questionable, but the transport facilities (cheap buses into Dublin city centre, for example) made up for it. It's not a very long walk to the city, and it's quite a pleasant one, provided you avoid the dog mess strewn canal path alongside the hotel!

Food and drink at the hotel was of fantastic quality, but that is reflected in the price. Both breakfast and dinner were very expensive. Bar food was again pricey, but you could eat in the bar instead of the restaurant, as we did once, and still feel satiated. If money is an issue, there is a lovely independent pizza place around the corner which served good portions at fantastic prices, with great service.

I would recommend this hotel to anybody staying in Dublin, but keep an eye out for offers on room prices, and book with meals included if possible. Don't be put off by the appearance of the area, we had no problems day or night.

",4,2013,08,04
211,The Staff are this hotels greatest asset,"this was a return visit and it certainly did not disappoint. Had slight problem with the water in the bathroom and we were immediately transferred to another room which was even nicer than our original one. Good sized room with very comfortable bed and well appointed bathroom. Had one of the nicest meals for a long time that evening in the bistro and were looked after by a very pleasant and helpful waiter called Andrew. All the food was absolutely delicious and very well presented.  After a great nights sleep buffet breakfast was lovely, as were the staff who made sure everyone knew where everything was. The hotel was very busy with a number of teams staying for cricket matches but all the staff were most attentive and pleasant.  We left with regret but will certainly be back again in the not too distant future.",5,2013,08,03
211,"Great spacious room, fab bed and easy location.","We stayed here for 2 nights and had a really nice stay. The hotel has some really nice benefits. We were upgraded and had access to the lounge with free coffee, water, fruit, biscuits, fab orange juice and even free continental breakfast till 11.30ish! There are also some books so I exchanged the one I finished for another.  

In the room they had a iPhone charger with speakers so we could listen to our own music.

On the negative side there was a Gaelic footy match on Sat and as the stadium entrance is exactly opposite the hotel it was mayhem. Still I guess you expect it.  We didn't watch a concert but picked this hotel because of the good feedback. The walk into the centre takes around 10-15 minutes, longer if u want to go to Trinity area. We hired the city bikes for a few Euros and that was worth it as you can explore further afield. The bike park is just around the corner, at Mountjoy square park but you need a credit card to hire them.

We also went to the local pub on both nights and it was a good crack with a great pint of Guinness. We'd stay here again.  If you don't like crowds it's not for you so check for match or concert days.

Easy to get to from airport, take either the 18 or 41 to Drumcondra station. From there walk back slightly and turn right into Clonliffe Road then right at next light into jones's Rd and the hotel is on your right opposite the stadium. €2.40 fare but you must have exact change! ",5,2013,08,03
211,Very Nice Hotel,"This is a large modern hotel with good-sized, comfortable rooms and excellent public areas (dining rooms, bars, open seating areas). Staff are excellent - very professional, helpful and friendly.  We found the beds comfortable and the breakfast buffet delicious. Being adjacent to the stadium it's not right in the centre of things but it is possible to walk into the city if you don't mind a 20-minute+ walk. The open-topped tour bus does pick-ups, but it doesn't drop off at the hotel so it's necessary to walk from the closest stop. There's not much choice of eateries or pubs nearby but we didn't find this a problem and would happily stay a the Croke Park Hotel again.",4,2013,07,31
211,A second stay,"Our return visit was just as comfortable as our first. The location is not in the city center, but I don't find that to be an issue. The rooms are comfortable and clean. The bathrooms on the executive level are extremely nice, as is the lounge. The only sign of wear is the carpeting in the hallways, don't let it put you off. The breakfast buffet was as excellent as I remembered.",4,2013,07,30
211,"Nice hotel, and very helpful staff","We liked this hotel.  It was very comfortable and clean, and the restaurants and bar were lovely.  The breakfast buffet in the morning was excellent, and staff was extremely helpful.  It is a bit of walk into downtown, but it doable.  Additionally, it is right across the street from the stadium which can be a disadvantage when there are big games in town if you are not planning to attend.  It can add to traffic around the area.  (our boys did attend the games though which they thoroughly enjoyed!)",5,2013,07,26
211,Superb,"First class everything, 
I stayed on the fourth floor
Superb room
Superb staff
Superb beds
Great food and room service
Stopped in Ireland 3 nights this week, best hotel of the bunch
Would defo recommend if in the area...",5,2013,07,25
211,Amazing stay,"Great hotel, excellent staff and lovely bar and restaurant areas. My wife and I stayed in a superior room and had access to the executive lounge which was a big bonus. We stayed as part of our anniversary tour of Ireland and we got a lovely welcome from staff, two small bottles of prosecco in our room and card which added  to our stay. 

We will definitely stay again!!",5,2013,07,23
211,Very clean & great atmosphere,"This was our first stop on our self guided tour of Ireland. The hotel was very clean with fresh modern decor. The front desk staff was extremely welcoming and helpful during our 2 night stay. This was our first time in Ireland and the staff gave some very helpful information. Prior to our arrival, I was nervous that the hotel's location would be far from the attractions that we wanted to see most. I was pleasantly surprised to find out that this was not the case. As long as the weather is cooperating, it is an easy 10-15 minute walk to the downtown area. We opted to walk from the hotel and back both days to tour the city. On our last day in Dublin, we needed a taxi to the train station due to the heavy luggage. The hotel was able to have a taxi there for us in less than 5 minutes.",5,2013,07,21
211,Thank you!,This is my very first feedback on tripadvisor and I am more than happy for it to be about The Croke Park Hotel.  I have stayed at The Croke Park Hotel twice with my daughters and from the moment we arrived we were very impressed by the standards in this hotel.  All the staff and management pleasantly surprised us with their hospitality and sincerity at wanting us to have an enjoyable stay.  It was such a treat to stay there.  The short distance to the shops was great to walk off the yummy breakfast and the dinners are delicious. We will definitely be back.,5,2013,07,21
211,Excellent.,"Our stay here was absolutely excellent. Starting with check-in, the staff were super friendly and helpful. We booked a deluxe double room and had access to the executive lounge which was a nice treat - as well as the free drink in the bar later that evening.

I could go on about how perfect everything was, so I'll pick the few negatives. 
Food in the bar was only okay, and the service was very poor. Maybe the staff elsewhere in the hotel made the contrast seem more evident, but the bar staff made it feel as if we were in a different hotel - in a bad way.

I really wanted to give the Croke Park Hotel 5 stars, but the bar let us down.

Other than that, I loved every minute of it.

I will be staying here again.",4,2013,07,19
211,Wow! Such helpful and amazing people,"The hotel itself is very clean and well maintained. Beds are comfortable and bar and restaurant have good food. What makes this hotel stand out is the staff. Starting off with our arrival, our flight actually came in early, the front desk offered us early check in with no extra charge. Our one night reservation included breakfast, and they told us we were welcome to have breakfast on this day also. We thought that was very sweet, but that wasn't even the nicest. On our way to the hotel, we had also gotten a flat tire. We changed it, but had to get the tire repaired. We asked the concierge where we could get that done. He told us there was no reason for us to spend our holiday at a tire shop and actually took the car in for us and handled the whole thing. We were able to spend our day having fun, and the car was fixed and ready for us upon our return. That kind of customer service is something rarely found and would have me returning to Croake Park again.",5,2013,07,19
211,By far and away the best so far!,"We've done a fair bit of travelling, me and the missus, and have stayed in some amazing place (and some complete crap ones too!) 

The Croke Park Hotel would have to be right up there with our all time favourite. Just perfect! 

The staff especially! They are just all so lovely and there is nothing they wont do to make your stay more enjoyable....... including upgrading us to the executive suite because it was my wifes Birthday.

The hotel itself is very nicely fitted out and very comfortable. The food and drinks in the bar downstair were very nice. Hell..... the waitress even sung Happy Birthday to the wife! 

Sure, it's a bit out of the centre of Dublin....... but i'm happy that it is! Dublin - which i adore - can get very busy and loud in the city centre so it was a nice to go out and experience that and have a few drinks etc etc but then come home to absolute luxury. 

Cannot wait to go back to Dublin and the Croke Park hotel is the ONLY place we will stay! Absolutely wonderful experience and a HUGE thank you to all the staff there. You guys are wonderful! 

(P.S. Special ""Thank You"" to the bar staff for bringing me up freshly poured pints from the bar at 1am when I was watching the footy in my comfy bathrobe.......Bless you!)",5,2013,07,18
211,Great Hotel at a good price,"My husband and I stayed at this hotel for four nights in May.  Although it is not in the ""best "" part of Dublin City, it is very easy to access all of the places of interest by bus, taxi or  hop on, hop off, tour bus.  Its a four star hotel with  spacious rooms and very comfortable beds.  Also a very good  restaurant serving a great buffet breakfast. Of course a big plus is Coke Park , if you happen to be a Gaelic sports fan. We know Dublin well as I am originally from Ireland, but I can understand the location for some visitors.",5,2013,07,16
211,Lovely place to stay,"We stayed here for three nights on a family holiday and used the hotel as a base from which to explore Dublin. It is a half hour walk or ten minute cab ride to the centre, but that suited us as we tend to stay out for the whole day anyway. The room was spacious, modern and well equipped. The bathroom was roomy and clean and the aircon throughout was lovely on such a scorching weekend! Breakfast was spot on - they made omelettes to order as well as having a great selection of hot and cold buffet food. Staff were friendly and helpful and even gave us a bottle of water to take with us on departure day - a small touch, but a thoughtful one, and indicative of how this place treats its guests.",5,2013,07,16
211,comfortable; helpful staff,"We stayed here for two nights, during the recent heat wave in Ireland, and were so grateful for the air conditioning. The front desk was most helpful with local information and getting us cabs, and all the staff members were friendly and courteous. The continental breakfast in the executive lounge was excellent. We came her on the recommendation of friends, and would gladly come again.",5,2013,07,16
211,Enjoyed our Stay!,"We stayed at the Croke  Park  Hotel in Dublin for three nights after driving around the Irish countryside.  It was just perfect for us.  The hotel is across from the Croke Park Stadium.  It was a, quiet hotel with nice amenities and an excellent restaurant.  We were able to catch several tours from the hotel and it was a short ride to the airport.  The staff was great and helped us with our plans and transportation needs.  There is always a taxi just outside the door.",5,2013,07,15
211,Luxury,"I had a very relaxing stay at this hotel. Hot towels on arrival to freshen up and the staff were great The food was excellent.  The bedroom was luxurious, equipped with everything you needed.  Attention to detail was excellent.  I would definitely recommend this hotel and hope to stay there again.",5,2013,07,14
211,Good value for money,We expected more from this hotel from the TripAdvisor ratings. The area that it is situated in is not very desirable but still only a 10 minute walk from the centre. The rooms are clean and ok but pretty standard Travel Lodge style. The staff however are really friendly and incredibly helpful. For the price it was a good option for the weekend.,3,2013,07,14
211,A great experience!,"We had a wonderful time at the Croke Park. The staff are excellent we had lunch in the bar which was tasty and great value for money. Rooms were a good size and spotless. We also had use of the executive lounge in our deal it was a real chill out experience tea coffee and cold soft drinks on tap! We did not eat in the restaurant in the evening, we decided to try the Italian restaurant next door which was also fab! We didn't got get the tickets to the guiness store house but we have been assured they will be posted as soon as possible as this was part of our package. Cant wait to visit the croke park again soon.",5,2013,07,13
211,Fantastic Hotel with Amazing Staff,"We loved our stay at The Croke Park. Starting with the moment we arrived...Our flight was very early and we arrived at the hotel by 6am. We figured we would check to see if we could get in early. Not only did we get in early, but they gave us a complimentary upgrade! Amazing! 

The rooms were clean, well stocked and perfect for our stay. It was in a great location to many places on our list and a great home base for our stay in Dublin. 

As I said in the title, the staff were amazing. Every member, including maintenance staff busy at work took the time to smile and greet us as we walked by. Such a nice gesture and made the stay even more comfortable. 

We would definitely stay here again and plan on it for our return to Dublin. Thank you to all the staff at The Croke Park Hotel for making our time in Dublin even better!",5,2013,07,11
211,high quality,"This is a lovely hotel with an excellent restaurant and a great lounge for those in executive rooms. The rooms are very clean, adequate in size, and quiet. It is on the pricey side but breakfast is included if you are on the executive floor. The restaurant offers a 15 Euro full Irish breakfast which we did not try. The major downside is the location, a 20 minute walk to the center of Dublin through not very interesting areas. Taking a taxi costs about 7-10 Euros each way. There is the green hop-on, hop-off bus that makes a stop at the hotel but the latest time it leaves Dublin is 15:30.
Right across the street is the Croke Park Stadium, a plus for sports fan, but if there is a match the streets are closed all around the hotel making it very difficult to access the hotel. We were there during a game and the hotel bar/lounge was filled with fans for hours after the game.",4,2013,07,11
211,"Beautiful rooms, outside the city center","We greatly enjoyed our stay at the Croke Park.  This was our first time in Ireland and the staff were extremely friendly. Room was huge by European standards and had very comfortable beds similar to the Sheraton Sweet Sleeper beds. 

Bathroom was very large and well lit. We were next to the elevator but didn't notice any noise. 

Great ice machine in the hall that also dispenses water. Tea and coffee service in the room. 

Hotel is about 15- 20 minutes out of town center, next to Croke Park stadium. 

Greatly enjoyed our stay. Will be back again!",5,2013,07,10
211,A Real Gem in Dublin!,"This Hotel is located within easy reach of the main centre of Dublin, A nice walk in fact.
The hotel is modern, clean and very well presented, the staff were very helpful and nothing was to much trouble. I had a king room located on floor 3 with views over looking the canal, room was very well presented and everything exceeded my expectations. 
The towels and bedding were of a high standard and the bed was itself comfy and a great nights sleep was had!
I was given an early check inn as my flight was early morning to which the hotel did not have too but did and this really helped me out! So thanks again for this. Little things had big impacts i.e hot hand towel when checking in, free parking for my friend who came to collect me from Belfast and upon checking out free bottles of water!

I highly recommend this hotel and when in Dublin Again I will deffo be booking this place! 
Well done and keep up the hard work, other hotels take note!",5,2013,07,09
211,Lovely hotel,Stayed here for hurling match....and extended stay. So convenient - we were able to bring my elderly mother to see the hurling match -she just had to walk across the road. Very clean - room excellent - large bathroom - food v good both in bar and restaurant. Best part of all was the free parking. ,5,2013,07,09
211,Brilliant Hotel!,"The hotel was gorgeous and from arrival to leaving the staff were amazing and couldn't do enough to help. We were upgraded ar check in and as it was my partners birthday during the time we were there the staff had put up balloons, banners and given us champagne which was lovely. The distance from O'Connell street wasn't that great, just a 10 minute walk. We thought the location was ideal as it was close enough without being in the centre of everything. Beds very big and comfy, we struggled to get out of them first thing in a morning. Rest of the room and bathroom were very clean, well kept and quite large. We had Irish breakfast included which was excellent - fantastic amount of choice in both food and drink and waiters/waitresses were very helpful. As we had been upgraded we also had access to the executive lounge from which we could choose to have a continental breakfast. This room was very cosy and we went in here on a few occasions before bed to make a hot chocolate as drinks were available all day. Dublin itself is a great city and I can't wait to go back. When I do I will definitely be staying in this hotel!",5,2013,07,09
211,Best in Dublin?,"This very nice hotel provides free wifi! What a treat! This is extremely important for world travelers like us. To get in touch of what happens back home and so forth. 
The bedroom was really nice and clean. The elegant bathroom came with shower and bathtub. There was a wide table against the wall, good for organizing personal stuff. On top of it there was a good sized mirror for lady (and gentleman, too) to make herself presentable. (Can’t you believe that some hotels don’t even had mirror next to electric outlet [for hair dryer]!)
The breakfast came with continental or hot breakfast buffet. All very classy!
The hotel located at 2 miles north of Dublin downtown, but we had no problem walking to see the River Dance Show (about 30 minute walk), watching the Needle in Dublin and visiting Trinity College. Croke Park Stadium is right next door, we did not know that it’s a BIG DEAL in Irish/Dublin! Taxi to airport is about $25.",4,2013,07,08
211,excellent stay,"We stayed here several nights while visiting the area and it was very pleasant.   Room was large, well furnished, immaculate (as was bathroom) and very comfortable.  Bed good as was sleep quality.   Staff was very pleasant and the concierge most helpful.  Parking good.   A convenient Hop-On-Hop-Off shuttle stops at the hotel and we availed ourselves of this several times to get to main area in town and their buses.  We walked back to the hotel from one of their stops.  Breakfast good as was dinner one night when I had the best lamb shank I have ever had.   Would definitely stay again.",5,2013,07,08
211,Lovely spacious room,Stayed here for one night and found it lovely and clean. The bedroom was large and lovely bathroom. The bar menu was limited and drinks here are pricey. The hotel is great location for the zoo and also Dublin port. Hope to stay again sometime.,4,2013,07,07
211,a lovely stay in Dublin.,"I stayed here last December, unexpectedly, and really enjoyed it,  Firstly its in a great location, though just out of walking distance from the centre of town, and secondly the staff are excellent and understanding. In February I had to cancel last-minute due to a change of plans, and they were perfectly OK with a refund - That is customer service.

It is also an excellent place for those with vehicles as parking is free, and anyone who regularly drives into Dublin with understand how that cost can rack up. It is also secure parking. The breakfast is excellent and the waiting staff had no problem with my fussy egg requirements.

Would happily stay there again, and indeed look forward to doing so.",5,2013,07,05
211,Executive Comfort,"After a 3 day tour throughout Ireland we chose this hotel because it was close to the airport. We checked in quite late but were greeted by 2 very friendly staff who also upgraded our room to an executive suite on the 4th floor with a complimentary continental breakfast. The room is very spacious and the bathroom is great, with a bath & a shower! Pure comfort after a long few days of travelling! We were also invited to enjoy breakfast in a private Executive Lounge - felt very spoilt.",5,2013,07,05
211,Value for money,"The location is handy as it is quite near to the town center. Parking for guest is free, staff friendly and very helpful. The room looked a bit tired but was quite alright.For the price, I would consider this hotel worthy of returning to.",4,2013,07,04
211,Perfect location for a match,"This hotel is ideal if you are going to a match in croke park, it literally is directly across the road. The hotel itself is lovely and very convenient. The room was extremely spacious and was very clean. The hotel is outside the city but is only a cab ride away. Staff were very helpful and gave us some great recommendations on where to eat.",5,2013,07,03
211,Perfect for business stay,"I stayed at the Croke Park Hotel for a week in June. That was a business trip and reservation was made by the corporate travel department. Initially when I first saw the location of the hotel and read some reviews I was worried about the surroundings. However my colleagues that stayed there before ensured me that it wasn't that dreadful. My personal opinion is that area is definitely not attractive. It doesn't look unsafe for a day walk, however I wouldn't walk there alone in the evening. Anyway I preferred to use taxi all the time. I think to get to the city center by foot would take me 25-30 mins, but I decided it would be better to spend that time in the city center instead of walking without any enjoyment of the area. Taxi was not a problem at all. To get to the city center it costed about 6-12 euros depending on the time of the day and distance. At the hotel reception stuff always helped to call a taxi for me and usually it arrived in 3-5 mins. When getting back I either took a taxi from outside of the pubs (there are always several of them waiting at the entrance) or at the taxi lane on the O'Connell Street Upper. 
Apart from the location there was no flaws at all. The stay was just perfect. Stuff was extremely nice, courteous and helpful. Room was comfortable and clean. Breakfast offered quite good variety of food and every morning I enjoyed really nice cappuccino :) I also had dinner at the hotel's restaurant a few times. I wouldn't say there was large selection of dishes but the food was good anyway. The hotel also offers free shuttle to the East Point Business Park in the morning (you just need to sign up for it in advance at the reception) Summarizing I'd say the Croke Park Hotel is perfect for a business stay. If you are there as a tourist you should be prepared to either use taxi all the time or have quite long walks over the unattractive area.",5,2013,07,03
211,Beware of football match times,The Hotel was good clean and very comfortable and good value but we rolled into town on football match day and had terrible time with traffic around the hotel. The shuttle bus will drop visitors in town for the Hop on Hop off but it does nt return travellers back to the hotel. Think this would be a good idea in the future.,4,2013,07,03
211,"Great hotel, great location","I have stayed in this hotel a couple of times, can't fault it at all.  Great location, very central to all major attractions, good spacious rooms and decent breakfast.  Very reasonably priced and nice staff.",5,2013,07,03
211,Take care with the location,"The Croke Park Hotel was our first stop on our family  Ireland adventure planned by Lisa Zwissler from Beach Bum Vacation.   We spent 3 nights at this hotel.  The room was clean and spacious with many amenities. The staff was very friendly and professional.  They even called ahead to Cork City to make sure everything was ready for us.  The breakfast buffet was delicious with a vast array of choices.
Should you plan to stay here, there are a few things you should know regarding the location. Croke Park Stadium is located directly across the street.  During our stay there was a concert in the stadium. The surrounding area, as well as, the bar and restaurant in the hotel were very crowded.  It was definately a party atmoshpere, lots of fun, but only if that is what you are looking for.
Also, this hotel is on the outskirts of Dublin.  It is about a 15 minute walk to get to the main area of town.  The hotel is wonderful but we will stay closer to town next time around.",4,2013,07,02
211,Excellent Hotel,"The Croke Park was easily the nicest hotel on my weeklong bus tour of Ireland. And all the others were very good. But the Croke stood out. Everything from the location, rooms, the service, the elevators, the dining room and pub, Wi-Fi, etc. All one could expect and more. 
I would definitely think of staying there for a future visit to Ireland/Dublin. Gary G.",5,2013,07,02
211,Good Hotel,"Good hotel with competent staff and comfortable clean rooms. It isn't always easy to find a hotel with free parking in Dublin and this hotel is a good choice if you travel to Dublin by car. I didn't use the restaurant or the leisure facilities. Good, clean, spacious room & ensuite.",4,2013,06,30
211,Excellent Hotel,"Stayed here on business last week for one night.Room was very comfortable, ensuite very high standard, many nice touches, trouser press, iron, ironing board, free wifi. The bed had the best mattress I have ever slept on. The staff were excellent, hot towel on check-in, an even warmer welcome! Paid on check out, the parking was free and the breakfast was good.
 The hotel is a little off the main drag, but a taxi was only €11 into Temple Bar, this may be a factor if you are planning on a longer stay. Our room looked out at the Hogan Stand entrance to Croke Parke and I am sure would make any GAA fans heart swell with pride, being from Donegal only improved the experience here! 
Sport aside, this is a really good hotel, with friendly staff who go the extra mile to make your stay a comfortable one.Planning to take the family back in the Summer and do some of the touristy things!",4,2013,06,26
211,Incredible Staff!,"I am an international flight attendant and I am always pleased to stay here at the Croke Park Hotel.  The staff is one of the best anywhere!  Very friendly & professional.  An example?  I had left an adapter in my room during an overnight.  A few weeks later I returned and they had my adapter in a bag with my Name, room # & date of my stay there.  That doesn't happen very often and I appreciate it that as a customer, we are valued!",5,2013,06,26
211,Good Hotel,"Stayed here recently for a night. Easy to find, but you would need a car as a bit from the city centre, about €8 taxi fare to city centre. The hotel itself is very modern with large rooms, good decent size bathroom and very clean. Staff were helpful and there is Free wifi. Breakfast was good. Price wise it was excellant and the car park is free which is an added bonus for a dublin hotel! I noticed they offer free hotel shuttle for business people down to that area of the city, nice touch!",4,2013,06,24
211,Nice hotel,"I stayed at this hotel recently on business. The hotel was modern and clean and the room was a decent size. Service was OK but not consistent.I was asked if I would sign up to their loyalty programme and was told I would receive a free bottle of water and newspaper...neither of which I received. On the subject of price this hotel is quiet expensive. I was also quiet taken aback at being charged €1 for a dash of cordial to accompany my €16 fish and chips(the first time I was  ever charged for it anywhere) , what disappointed me most was they didn't even have orange and I had to settle for blackcurrant but yet was still charged. 
Breakfast was nice and there was plenty to choose from.
Overall the hotel was nice and service was good. The doors banged very loudly behind them so may not suit light sleepers",3,2013,06,23
211,Surprisingly good hotel in weird location,"Both good facilities and service in central Dublin. However, would not recommend unless driving as extremely weird location unless going to sporting event at adjacent stadium.

Hotel was good at calling when left item in room.",4,2013,06,23
211,Warm Irish hospitality,"I stayed at the Croke Park Hotel in June 2013 for 6 nights for business and in general I have a very good impression about it. Thanks very much to the stuff of The Croke Park Hotel!

Some details which might be helpful:
- Maybe this is something common but first time for me: during check in warm wet towels were offered to clean hands. It was so nice :). 
- WiFi is free. Check out the booklet on the table in the room for more info on this. 
- We used courtesy bus to East Point Business Park in the morning which is free of charge. You just need to book it in advance (ask a receptionist).
- I used safety room to leave my laptop while I went outside in the evening. It's free. One note here: the procedure was different depending on who of the receptionist did this :). One of them asked for my room number, packed laptop into plastic bag and asked to leave my sign. Another asked for the room number and gave me a counterfoil. Another one just took my laptop, asked the room number and that's it :) There was no any problem to get it back in any case :).
- What I liked is that bath room has bathtub and shower. It is very convenient as you have a choice :)  
- On the breakfast: Sometimes newspapers were offered on the entry. It was kind of new for me as well and very nice :) You asked for what kind of coffee you wish and if you want toasts. 
- On the Bar: There is a nice fire place there. You can ask to prepare cocktail if you know the recipe. Ask for Irish Flag Shot. It is something :) See photos.    

Hope it will be helpful to someone and you will enjoy your staying in this hotel and will love Ireland and irish people :)",5,2013,06,23
211,Brilliant,"I booked this as a surprise for my boyfriends birthday in January off the website 'Secret Escapes.' I think it was around £89 a night but it was absolutely brilliant. We were placed in an Executive room with access to the executive lounge which had 24 hours refreshments. 
Totally worth it, and we had a lovely stay. Only problem would be that although it has a brilliant location for Croke Park, it is a good 15 minute walk to the centre, we didn't mind though and would 100% return as the room and staff were lovely.",5,2013,06,23
211,Very stylish modern hotel,"Loved this hotel, room fab, staff helpful and lovely, reception staff very informative. Bar prices a wee bit steep but then it's dublin. Hotel dubin very warm and modern, tastefully done. Breakfast was good and plentiful. The area wasn't the best but it didn't put me off at all would return no probs....",4,2013,06,20
211,Great for exploring,Great hotel for exploring the city of Dublin. Location is perfect and just beside the National Football Stadium. The tour there is well worth taking. The staff were friendly and the service was just right. We did not eat there but spoke to some fellow guests who did and they had good reposts. The room was new and well though out - no fridge - and parking was easy. Really enjoyed the trip to Dublin.,4,2013,06,20
211,5/5 in everything,"Beautiful hotel, great service and extremely helpful and friendly international staff. You cannot go wrong here. The room was very nicely furnished, clean, quiet and the bathroom huge. 
It may be a bit out of the way to walk to the city center, but taxis are readily available.
I would definitely recommend it to anyone.",5,2013,06,19
211,great hotel,"Stayed here for a stags party this weekend and we cannot fault this hotel.
Great service , friendly and helpfull staff , location is brilliant and the hotel had that new feel about it even if it is there a few years.
Also bars staff were great and had no problems cracking a few jokes with the stag party.
We also ate here before leaving on the sunday and the food was very nice and not to expensive

10/10",5,2013,06,18
211,A+ Hotel.,Berfore arriving to the hotel I informed the hotel I was planing to get engaged.  They could not have made the night anymore perfect.  We went for dinner in the hotel which was top class.  After dinner we went back to the hotel room which we there was rose petals in the bath and all over the bed and a bottle of buble on ice.  This is when I popped the question.  We have just recently got married and planning our next stay in the hotel as it has gave us a great moment that we can alway look back on.,5,2013,06,17
211,Hello Croke park,"A good hotel , not cheap, but well appointed.  We took the level 4 upgrade. the rooms were v good, access to the executive lounge was great.  The big down was the lack of a fridge in the room but a washbasin ful of ice to keep the mineral water and Guinness cold helped.
Some complained about the after game congestion in the hotel.  This was bearable as the staff helped to get us fed and the good humour and friendliness of the hurling spectators is most refreshing - the Irish, a peaceful people who play awesome games.  I will be returning this year for, hopefully , a conclusive hurling grand final.  Proximity to Croke Park was a very big plus.",4,2013,06,17
211,Touring Ireland June 9 through 15,"We started our trip from JFK airport at 5:30 pm on Saturday  and arrived in Dublin at 5:00 am on Sunday, a bit tired.   With that said,  Aer Lingus Vacation store didn't send our full reservation to the Croke Park Hotel. But the the Staff at the Croke had been MORE THAN ACCOMMODATING !!!! They made a new reservations for the other half of our party. As well,  let us check in and go to our rooms at 7 am !!!! The food at the restaurant was good, location/area was ok. rooms were nice. We only stayed one night, as we were touring through out the country. Thank You to The Croke Park Hotel !",4,2013,06,16
211,Helpful staff,"Reasonably priced, clean comfortable rooms, friendly helpful staff and opposite the stadium where I was attending a conference. I broke my foot earlier in a fall just before I arrived. The staff were helpful in pointing me towards a medical centre.",4,2013,06,16
211,"An outstanding, welcoming and comfortable hotel",From arrival this hotel did not disappoint! The check in was friendly and efficient. The room was spacious and clean! With all the amenities you require. Both dinner and breakfast was gorgeous! We will definitely be back to stay!! Free car parking was a bonus! ,5,2013,06,16
211,Doyle Collection Chain - Would highly recommend,"We booked the Croke Park Hotel by reading reviews on Trip Advisor and it was an excellent choice.  My husband and I and our adult son spent 4 nights at this hotel and we loved it.  Right from the welcoming lobby to the pleasant staff on the front desk to the warm facecloths we were given at checkin, we liked the hotel.  Our room was clean, comfortable beds and pillows, and all the amenities. We liked that your room key had to be used to acess the elevator for security reasons.  when we booked we could not get a room closer to Templebar and Grafton Street in a hotel with. 4 star rating with reviews we liked so we booked the Croke Park.  At first we were disappointed with the  location, but that quickly changed.  We booked the hop on, hop off bus tour which gave you 2 days access and each morning a free shuttle bus would pick you up at the hotel every 1/2 hour and bring you to the start of the hop on, hop off right on Grafton Street.  Took about 10 minutes.  We would then find a place for breakfast, look around, shop and catch the hop on when we were ready.  At the end of the day we would end up in Templbar for dinner and drinks and when we were ready it was only a 10euro taxi ride back to the Hotel.  By then a quiet, secure clean hotel was welcomed.  would highly recommend this hotel.",5,2013,06,15
211,Great hospitality,"We are still here as part of a 7 day stay to attend a conference and have some fun as well. After 5 nights I feel qualified to review it already. The basic things: location is good- 15 minutes pleasant walk to the CBD and opposite the spiritual heart of sporting Dublin with a hop on hop off pick up point right outside. Room- nice size with a beautiful soft bed, nice bathroom with a great bath and lots of hot water. It has one of those pesky bar fridges that don't allow you to store your own stuff in it but this was not a concern. TV is flat panel and good size. Also nice and quiet with little street noise. Air con is good. Service- really good. Every team member was solicitous helpful, friendly and ready with a smile to go the extra yard. Sean was amazing. We were on the exec floor and it was worth it. Access to a lounge with tea and coffee etc and continental breakfast which was really good. Restaurant was good and the bar really good. We got some complimentary drink vouchers and had a great time every night in front of the fireplace with some very creative and tasty cocktails. Full,breakfast was also,very good. 

Overall I rate this place very highly because it combines all the elements of a  5 star hotel with 6 star service. Recommend it highly and will not stay anywhere else when we return to Dublin ",4,2013,06,14
211,The Doyle Collection chain is for me!,"Hello everyone, I have just returned from a one week stay at Croke Park Hotel in Dublin and here is my review. Like you prior to booking this hotel, I reviewed the selection of hotels in Trip Advisor to see what comments had been posted. I made my selection based on price and convenience. This hotel seemed to offer everything I was looking for, I had read several reviews were the distance to the city center seemed to be a problem or that the district seemed somewhat undesirable. I can now confirm that you are getting great dollar value at this hotel, if this hotel was closer to the city center it would probably cost twice the price, parking alone could cost you 30 euros a day. I arrived with a rented car and parked directly in their indoor parking lot. At the front desk I was greeted with a smile and within two minutes I was off to my room (152) that was on the first floor. I like the security in this hotel; you need to swipe your access card in the elevator in order to access your floor. This is a large modern hotel with several hundred rooms spread out on four floors. My room was huge, it had a double bed as well as a single bed. Mini bar, blow dryer, iron and more. This room offered a view of the courtyard which was fine for me since I am a light sleeper and hate hearing traffic at night. On my very first night I kept hearing a thud every once in a while, I found this most frustrating. In the morning I wandered around to find out where it was coming from. It just happened that the service elevator and stairs were just on the back side of my room. When I opened and walked in the stairway I instantly heard the door thud as it came to a close. It seems that the attenuating rubbers were gone. I went to the front desk to see if I could have a change of rooms since this was very bothersome to me. Instantly the attendant browsed the available rooms and offered me a smaller room on the fourth floor with a king size bed, this worked out marvelously for me. The concierge came to see if everything was okay.  I showed him the faulty door, he noted it down and said he would have maintenance fix this. The next day I realized I had forgotten my alarm in the other room, I asked the front desk to see if they could have someone pick it up. When we returned later that evening my alarm was in my room with a note from the front desk, this is the kind of service I enjoy, nice touch. Breakfast buffet with service between 6:30–10:30 at the Sideline Bistro on the ground floor was chic yet informal, Breakfast was included with my package. This buffet displayed a wonderful choice, several fruit juices, eggs sausages, bacon, beans, tomatoes, mushrooms yoghurt, plenty of different cheeses and fresh fruits, what more could you ask for. If management is reading this I would like to say that the service for breakfast is simply exquisite. I also found an Italian restaurant a couple of hundred feet from the hotel called Wallace`s Italian Winebar, excellent food at a lesser price than downtown core restaurants, 16 euros will get you a choice of a two course meal with wine. Parking is free for all guests at the Croke Park, you just need to have reception validate your voucher prior to leaving. I had read some reviews that this was a problem for some but not while I was there, there`s always several attendants at the front desk I did not find this to be a problem. A couple a days later I found a letter in my room informing me that there would be a Leinster Football Quarter Finals game at Croke Park stadium, and that the hotel might be busier than normal during the evening. Well when I arrived around supper time the streets around the hotel were closed to traffic and thousands of fans were marching to the stadium.  I had never seen so many people at a game, the Croke park stadium which is just next door holds some 80,000 fans, and most impressive is that it seems to be legal to BYOB to the stadium, actually I`m not sure if it`s legal but no one seems to mind if you drink in the streets of Dublin. It really wasn`t a problem to access the hotel but so many people in the lobby and walking around, but all was well controlled, it was quite an experience to see. I have to say that this is one of the best managed hotels I have ever been to, bravo to the general manager Alan Smullen and of course to all the members of his team, you guys rock! I have to say that at first it was a toss between the Croke Park or the Jury`s hotel, I chose the Croke Park and I made the right choice. When I return to Dublin the Croke Park is where I will stay. Trust me just try it.

Cheers!",5,2013,06,13
211,Good Value but a bit tired,"This hotel is situated right next to Croke Park, so perfect if you are visiting sports events there. A bit of a walk (c 1 mile) from the city centre but loads of taxis. Rooms were big and clean. Breakfast very good and bar quite nice. Decor a bit tired but overall this was good value.",4,2013,06,12
211,Fabulous Hotel,"This was a great stay. Stayed on a Monday night. Great service, great food, great everything !The girls on reception were helpful and friendly. The rooms were spotless and had everything you could want. I asked for a quiet room and boy did I get one. Had a fantastic nights sleep in a lovely big bed with crisp white sheets and plenty of pillows. Because of the package I had, I had access to the executive lounge and was able to get coffee, tea, fruit, juices and water at any time. Had dinner in the bar and the food was lovely too.
All in all a great stay, and would recommend this hotel as it would be a great base for exploring Dublin.",5,2013,06,12
211,Very impressive,"I was very impressed by this hotel for a business visit. The decor was lovely, the staff were excellent and the breakfast delicious. And even though the hotel was completely full (itself a great sign!), it was really quiet in my room. I couldn't fault this hotel. It was excellent value for money. A little bit awkward to find for someone like me who doesn't know Dublin well but given that I was working in Croke Park the next day, it couldn't have been more convenient.",5,2013,06,11
211,Fantastic Hotel,"We spent one night 23 May 2013 at the Croke Park Hotel and thoroughly enjoyed our stay. The staff were friendly and helpful and the rooms were clean, spacious, comfortable and modern!
We had a very enjoyable light meal in the bar on Thursday evening and a lovely breakfast on Friday morning. Very good value for money and we would like to have stayed longer.",5,2013,06,08
211,A bit off the beaten path but very good ...,"I would not choose this hotel if interested in walking around Dublin city center (its a bit far to be convenient for that), but great rooms, staff, convenient onsite parking and near enough to good restaurants (including the one at the hotel) to satisfy.  Taxis to the city center are convenient (as are returns) and if attending an event at Croke Park itself this is THE place to stay because of convenience.  Good pricing properly reflective of its off the beaten path location, and north of the river which is important for airport runs during normal business day traffic.",4,2013,06,07
211,"Nice hotel, good value","We stayed 1 night here on our recent trip to Dublin. The hotel was very nice and new, room was great as was the breakfast. We also ate lunch in the bar which was good. We stayed on a Monday night so I was able to book a special deal that included 2 passes for the hop-on hop-off bus that takes you all over Dublin and stops right outside the hotel. I highly recommend using this bus even if passes are not included in your rate, especially since the hotel is not very close to the city center. That is the only drawback to this hotel in my opinion, it's a bit far from most attractions. Overall a great hotel!",4,2013,06,05
211,"As Dublins affordable hotels go, this is good.","I stayed here for a conference at Croke Park. Its 20 metres from the stadium so perfect.
Hot towel on check-in was a nice touch.
Reception staff courteous and friendly. I found the bar/waiting staff not as approachable, almost over busy with few people to serve. They want you to sit and be served at your table which is nice but you wait longer than if you walk to the bar and order, the waiting staff see you but don't intervene/offer to bring to tour table.
Food was good.
I've stayed before and I'd stay again.",4,2013,06,04
211,great stay!!!,"Very nice hotel with large, clean and modern rooms with everything you need and nice comfy beds!!! the food is superb, breakfast: very good selection and tasty. We ate in bar which was also tasty, i would recomend the 'beef burger' it was delicious and laura who worked in the bar was very helpful and professional!!! staff very good and good concierge... would definately return!!!",5,2013,06,03
211,Anniversary treat,"In a complete quandary as to where to stay on our first trip to Ireland, I booked this hotel on the strength of the good reports found here on TripAdvisor. I can only add more praise to the positive comments already posted for the Croke Park Hotel. Firstly, the Hotel does stand out from its humble surroundings/neighborhood and perhaps is better suited to a more modern/uncrowded setting. However, this should not detract from its worth as a first choice for any trip to Dublin whatever the reason for your visit. We found the staff very helpful, friendly and accommodating. This was evident when we arrived early and were allowed to check in moreover, the upgraded family room we had been given was quickly swapped for a double of equally high standard, this suited us better as just a couple and hopefully freed up a family room too. As really nice surprise we were also treated to some freshly chilled sparkling wine by the management to celebrate our anniversary, a really delightful gesture. The hotel, dining hall and rooms are tastefully decorated and very clean. The food was of an excellent quality and breakfast in particular was just amazing in its wide choice and presentation. Our room was spacious and very comfortable with an amazing bathroom and walk in shower. Its very evident that all the staff take a great deal of pride in making their guests feel valued, I can't thank the staff enough for making our stay feel truly special. I have stayed in many hotels over the years and can honestly say this is one of the best of its type for quality and standards. Without hesitation we can highly recommend this hotel.",5,2013,05,31
211,Expected better from a 4* hotel,"I have to say that on 1st impression with the hotel all was excellent, hot towels on arrival, staff very helpful, we were very early for our room, but we had booked for the executive lounge and we were able to use this straight away. Having had an extremely early flight from Liverpool this was most welcome, the food was lovely, and very handy to have.

HOWEVER this is where the helpfulness ended. When we did book into our rooms, our room had 4 people in it, but was only equipped for 2 , the shower door did not shut, which ended up with the shower leaking severely over the bathroom floor, we phoned the front desk and said they would send someone up. They did, but not a maintenance worker but the concierge, which I thought was strange, he slammed the door quite a lot said it was fixed, but we checked and it wasn't, when this was pointed out, he was less than happy and you could tell this in his words spoken make to us.
The front desk asked if we would like to move room there and then or later, as we were on our way out it was later, on our return, they seemed not to know anything about this and even informed us that maintenance had fixed the door!!!!!! MMMMMM until i pointed out that in fact it was the concierge that had been sent up, they were not happy about the move, and seemed quite put out when i asked if this room as in fact set up for the number of people in the room unlike the 1st one.

We moved to another room, the shower still leaked, it seemed that the base of the shower wasn't sealed correctly and therefore water just spilled all over the place, the room was very dark, 1st room had a free standing lamp, this one didn’t. Our rooms keys were constantly having to be re magnetised, even from going up in the lift and trying to get in to room, I have to say by the end of the stay we had had enough of the cards, as every time we needed them, they never worked. The front desk just seemed to get annoyed when we told them they weren’t working AGAIN!!!! Lets face it was soooo much fun for us.

Breakfast was good, they offer you a choice of coffee, if they can be bothered, didn’t get offered it on the 1st day, but did the 2nd.
They do have a free shuttle into town, and the staff on these are great, last one back though is 2.30 in the afternoon. The walk isn’t too bad, but as a previous review has pointed out, the route is unclean and at times smelly. We did walk back at night, but we had a group of 6, so felt that we were safe enough

I know these problems to some people arn't the end of the world, but when you save to stay in a very nice hotel, with 4* and expecting luxury these things can ruin a stay.",3,2013,05,29
211,Croke Park Hotel,"Would recommend the Croke Park Hotel.
The hotel operates at a very high standard and takes pride in it's appearance. 
All staff were polite and helpful, must give a special mention to the Italian waitress who went the extra mile in helping us plan our visit. This is not to undermine the hotel concierge who was also helpful.
Although arrived early, the reception staff went to great efforts to check us in well in advance of the recommend time.
The cleanliness of the hotel was to an exceptional standard. Rooms were large and airy and most importantly were very quiet, even though the hotel was busy. The bathroom is large light and airy and prepared to a high standard cleanliness.
Check out time is generous. The use of hotel facilities were excellent.
Be aware that the hotel is about 20-25 minutes' walk from the city centre - suggest you plan your route in advance.
The hotel may not be located in the best of areas (adjacent to Croke Park Rugby Ground) and the local area run down - do not let this put you off as there is more advantages than disadvantages.
If you are prepared to walk, all the main amenities, places of interest etc. are accessible. Take care of avoiding the dog poo, especially on side streets, this appears to be a problem here in Dublin
Would recommend if you travel back from the city centre (especially after dark) that you take sensible precautions as you would in any other busy city centres'.
Note: the Hop on Off bus will transfer you to the city pick up point - excellent if you intend to visit the Places of interest.
Although did not eat in at the hotel in the evening, the food looked good and wine a little pricey (standard for a large hotel), we decided to eat out every night.
Can recommend the Italian restaurant just down the road if not eating in the hotel.
Fagin's pub / restaurant which was also recommended by the concierge (about 15min walk). If the restaurant is good enough for Bill Clinton and Bertie Ahern, it is a good testament of service and quality of food.
Breakfast is excellent in the large light and airy restaurant.
Airport transfer was by public transport the number 16 bus or number 41. This is cheaper than using the airport dedicated bus - be mindful this journey will take slightly longer. The bus will drop you at The Railway Station / Quinns and the hotel is a 10 minute walk from the bus stop.
Would recommend and certainly would return to the hotel when we next visit.",5,2013,05,29
211,Bank Holiday Weekend Stay,"My boyfriend and I returned home yesterday after a 3 night stay at the Croke Park. As keen travellers we have stayed in some great hotels around the world and Croke Park is definitely one of the better ones. 

Rooms are spacious, very clean and the bathroom has a large shower and a separate bath. We were on the fourth floor and also had access to the executive lounge which included a continental brekkie and water/coffee 24/7. Beds are really comfy and we had a dressing gown and slippers thrown in too (didn't wear them but was a nice touch)

We were concerned after reading reviews about the distance from the city centre, we walked everyday and it took 15/20mins. The area you walk through is pretty unclean with rubbish, dog poo and graffiti all around you so be prepared to do it with an open mind! The walk was fine during the day but after a lot of drinking and Irish jigging we grabbed a takeaway and a taxi back which cost us €10/15 each time. Obviously you can walk it if you wish but it's a good 25mins away from Temple Bar. (And maybe not that safe in the dark)

We would stay here again as the hotel/staff/rooms and service are lovely but as first time visitors to Dublin, I would recommend that you choose a hotel closer to the city centre to save you time and money. ",5,2013,05,28
211,Very nice stay and good value for money.,"We stayed here for 4 days. The welcome at the reception was very pleasant with hot towels. The concierge helped us to book dinner at short notice. The rooms were sizeable and tastefully decorated, with plenty of storage space. Bed very comfortable, though mobile (on wheels). Large bathroom. 
The staff are very friendly, and the breakfast is outstanding.
Located away from city centre (about ~25 mins walk to O'Connell Street) but not a difficult walk to navigate. 
Overall, a very pleasant stay.",5,2013,05,28
211,Beautiful Hotel,Came here gw2 friends for a concert in the O2! The rooms were beautifully decorated and to a very high standard and very clean! The beds were very comfortable and the staff were very friendly.  The breakfast the next morning was delicious.  Overall a great stay and would come back here in the future as it's in a very good location,5,2013,05,28
211,Even better second time round,"As you may have gathered from the title of this review this was not my first stay in this hotel. Enjoyed our first stay so much we returned for a second time with our 8 year old daughter, Previous reviewers have talked about the friendliness of the staff and the little ""extras"" like towels on arrival and water when you leave all very true and part of the great welcome you receive. They could also mention the free parking for guests, which is a real bonus in Dublin, and the pay per view movies which includes a great selection of family movies, ideal for winding down after a day at the zoo! Some reviewers have mentioned the distance from the city centre but I would disagree. We walked it, comfortably,  with our 8 year old in around fifteen minutes and that was to O'Connell street - all part of the fun. We had a great family weekend away and this hotel was integral to that. Thanks and keep up the good work!",5,2013,05,27
211,Great Hotel,"We recently stayed at the Croke Park Hotel and had a very good experience overall. It's true that it's a fair walk from the city center (though still walkable), but we took advantage of the hop-on/hop-off bus tour that had a shuttle pick us up and take us downtown every morning. The hotel itself has very clean and the service was great. We really enjoyed the amount of choices available at their buffet-style breakfast, so this always gave us a good start to a full day of touring Dublin!",5,2013,05,25
211,A true Irish welcome,"Great hotel, welcoming reception staff with warm towel--- nice touch for a weary traveller. Nice room with comfie bed, lovely walkin shower.Bottled water complimentary on checkout, its the little extras that make the difference.",4,2013,05,25
211,An excellent hotel- ideal when visiting North Dublin,"Stayed for one night at shoet notice. Delighted - no complaints. Clean, welcoming and so comfortable. Food excellent.  Would stay again if visiting this area of Dublin. 

Rooms well equipped, ice and water machines available on all floors.  
",4,2013,05,24
211,Nice and quiet hotel,"Very clean and modern hotel in a nice and peaceful atmosphere.
A quiet location, even though near a stadium and train rails but no noise whatsoever during our stay. It is a bit far to walk to the center of the city but a taxi isn't too expensive. 
The sideline bar of the hotel offers good meals with a decent value/price ratio. Friendly staff but sometimes it took very long, even though not many people were in the bar, before we could eat and pay. 

      
      ",4,2013,05,22
211,"Good Hotel,but shame about the dog poo !","Hotel is lovely and the staff were very helpful. The breakfast was rather expensive and salty.
However the hotel is located a good 25 minute walk to the city centre. The walk is very unpleasant. You pass streets with lots of Dog Poo on the pavements. Very dodgy people hanging around the streets. Boarded up and vandalised houses.
A suggestion to the Croke Park Hotel, is to provide a free mini bus service to and from the city centre.",3,2013,05,21
211,"Nice hotel, location lacking","Croke Park Hotel is directly across from the Croke Park Stadium. Not so sure about the area, seemed ok to walk around during the day. Not centrally located near any shops or restaurants. The closest pub we found was about 10+min walk but we enjoyed it (Fagan's Pub which had good food, spacious, inviting pub, OK service).
Adequate parking structure. We found it annoying that to park you receive a ticket then you have to get it validated at the reception every time you left. And there were two lifts; one to get from your room to the reception then another from the reception down to parking. All operated by having to swipe your room key.

Room was nice, clean, beds comfortable but were on wheels and rolled. We overheard other people complaining about the rolling beds as well. Our room included a full bed and a twin bed. We didn't request the twin bed or know it was included. Would have been nice to have the extra space as we did not use the twin. Huge window with no view(just the side of the building). The bathroom was very nice and clean; separate shower and big bathtub. Adequate closet space and drawers, small TV, provided hair dryer. 

We tried the bar downstairs which was lovely. The service was outstanding, multiple servers came around to see if we had been helped and to check on us. We didn't order any drinks from the bar but the selection was decent. We did order coffee/tea and desserts which were lovely. The bar was spacious with two smaller TVs near the bar and a Big screen TV opposite of them (see pics).

Our stay included breakfast which was your average buffet breakfast. Again, the service was great and the food selection was good and fresh. The thing we didn't like was how busy it got (we got there shortly after it opened at around 7 am). The crowd was loud which made us eat and leave quickly. We had enjoyed peaceful breakfast buffets at the other hotels we stayed in.

All in all, this hotel is nice but would try another one if in Dublin again.

PROS: clean, excellent service
CONS: location, parking validation",4,2013,05,20
211,Excellent modern hotel and well priced,"This was by first stay at the Croke.  Normally I stay in the Hilton Dublin so when I heard that my company had booked me into a hotel which was only 80 euros per night instead of 123 euros I was dreading it.  The area around the hotel is not exactly the most picturesque part of Dublin and the hotel is right next to Croke Park Stadium so not sure who noisy it gets if there is a game or concert on.  Anyway back to the hotel - wow what a surprise - modern, spacious, tastefully decorated throughout.  I had a room with a balcony which may have been an executive room and it was very spacious, bright and well equipped.  Large bathroom with separate bath and shower cubicle.  Much bigger and nicer than any room I've stayed in at the Hilton and the best hotel overall that I have experienced in Dublin city centre so I was very pleasantly surprised indeed.  The hotel is the right side of the city for the airport which I guess is why it is popular with airline crews.  That is usually a good sign as American airlines are normally pretty choosey about where their staff stay.  Not much in the way of quality eateries in the vicinity.  Places called things like Apache Pizza - 'there's lots of cowboys but only one Apache' sort of sums it up.  The closest pubs are of the spit and sawdust variety but friendly enough.  15-20 mins walk from O'Connell Street if you want a better selection.  Food choice and quality is good and the breakfast spread is outstanding.  I'm actually looking forward to my next stay at this hotel.",5,2013,05,17
211,Great hotel at reasonable price,"Myself, my husband and our two small children stayed the night over the bank holiday. The hotel is lovely. Very modern with plenty of seating areas to relax. The service deserves a special mention. Every staff member we came into contact with was polite, efficient and went out of their way to make us feel welcome. It's the small touches that make the difference. At check in the man in the desk spoke to my older daughter (5) and added a complimentary movie onto our room for her. Breakfast was of a very high standard - particularly the continental choices. We loved the mango syrup with natural yoghurt and mixed nuts. We checked the reviews on trip advisor before booking here and we were not disappointed. We hope to return with our girls in the future.  ",5,2013,05,14
211,Brilliant hotel,"Me, my sister and friend stayed here a couple of nights ago as we visited Beyonce at the O2 arena.  The hotel made our trip to Dublin even better than imagined.  On arrival we upgraded for a small price which entitled us to use the executive suite whenever we needed.  We were offered breakfast on arrival and the following day. In the restaurant there was a slight mix up of understandings and we plated up a hot breakfast instead of cold but the friendly staff in the restaurant told us not to worry.  We also received two free cocktails each as there was a very small wait for our room.  The staff at this hotel are very friendly and understanding. Thanks for making our trip extra special! 5 stars!",5,2013,05,14
211,excellent dublin hotel,"located to the north of the city and right outside croke park this is an excellent hotel. Very well run, great service and a good restaurant as well as a good base to explore the city with handy parking.",4,2013,05,14
211,Very good hotel,Stayed here for one night. Very nice hotel. Staff all good. Great facilities. Lovely breakfast. Overall very good value for money city centre hotel. Worthy of its high rating on trip advisor. Would stay here again.,4,2013,05,12
211,Croke Park a must.,Stayed at the Croke Park hotel recently and it was top notch.I travel the world and stay in some of the very best hotels but this stay was as good as any.The staff were very well mannered and cheerfull even for an early breakfast when it was busy.A special mention for the female member Michelle who was so plesant and chatty that I would not hesitate to recomend this hotel to any person business or otherwise.,5,2013,05,12
211,Luxurious,"We stayed here in August 2012 and had a lovely time. Quite far from the city centre but walkable if you fancy it, it takes approx 25mins. There are taxis and public transport very close so you can just hop on a bus too. The rooms and decor was very plush. The room had black out curtains if you fancy a snooze in the day. It was quiet in the room and no noise from the road. We had breakfast which was lovely and even had the England cricket team there at one of the breakfast services. My husband was very pleased. The concierge was very helpful and recommended two places to eat that were both lovely. We would definitely stay here again even with the distance from the capitals main attractions.",5,2013,05,11
211,"Very nice hotel, not too central","The hotel is clearly very nice: rooms are nice, beds are very comfortable, prices are correct, the bar and restaurant is a nice place. It isn't exceptional but for sure a very solid proposition.

The main downfall is that it's a bit out of the center: apart of being in front of the Croke Park stadium, there's little or nothing close-by, so you either need to walk a bit or take a cab to reach the center.",4,2013,05,10
211,One of the best hotels,"Stayed in this hotel in January.The room was fab big soft bed and lovely room.Breakfast and dinner were great.The staff I have to say we're the friendless I have ever and I mean ever! Had in any hotel iv ever stayed in.Since iv been 3 of my friends have stayed and they said the same thing. Amazing .:) 
",5,2013,05,10
211,Great spot for Dublin visiting!,"Beautifully clean, modern, comfortable and well-located hotel. Easy access from the airport or buses for the area, great underground parking within immediate location of the rooms. The room was lovely, including the walk-in shower and huge towels. There is a generous breakfast buffet (you can request cappuccino as well as regular tea and coffee) including all of the full Irish breakfast items. Staff is courteous, helpful and friendly. It was a welcome oasis in the bustle of Ireland. Easy access to bus or airport, located across the street from the incredible stadium, which is a good landmark for finding your way back! The room was spotless with really good appointments (desk, chairs, amenities) and the ice machine was right outside our door. Access is controlled by keycard in the elevator. The conservation measures are awesome - keycard to control all electrics, LED or CF light bulbs, eco toilet.",5,2013,05,09
211,Proper 4 star Hotel not afraid to go the extra mile,"Stayed here on a short break - but wished it could have been longer. Had got a ridiculously good offer online and expected basic 4 star, however what we got bordered on 5 star. Spotless and luxurious with some lovely touches throughout the hotel. Will definitely visit again - just not for a Gaa match as prices climb far too high. ",5,2013,05,07
211,Rebel Yell,I have stayed in the hotel a few times and it is comfortable and  clean the staff were pleasant apart from one lady at the reception who was a bit bored with the occasion for someone who stays in Dublin a lot I rarley stay in CPark because there is better value around the City. The breakfast was a let down no sausages dried bacon and to be fair the breakfast station was grubby which was not the case in previous visits.,3,2013,05,07
211,Lovely Hotel,Our family arranged our visit to Dublin and stay at this hotel for our birthdays for 3 days and the hotel was excellent. The food was very good and dining staff very helpful. We bought The freedom ticket and would recommend it if staying for a few days. The hotel is about 15 mins walk from the city centre but the ticket can be used for all the Dublin buses and there is a bus stop about 5 mins walk from the hotel and also the hop on hop off company provide a courtesy bus at certain times through out the day outside the hotel. Lots to see and do especially the many bars in the Temple Bar area of the city where you can sit and relax and soak up the Irish music and atmosphere and of course enjoy the Guinness and Killkenny beer. A visit to the Guinness Experience is definitely recommended and all the National attractions are free to go see. The hop on hop off buses are super and the chat from the drivers is very entertaining and funny. All in all we had a fantastic 3 days there and are looking forward to returning at some time in the future.,4,2013,05,07
211,If it wasn't for the location this would be a wonderful hotel,"Very nice hotel, the only complain I have is the location... not in the best area and I wouldn't want to walk there alone with my son at night. It was also quite far from the main shopping area but we did walk there and it took a good 20-30 minutes. I also thought the breakfast was overpriced, we learned our lesson and walked into the center of town the next day and ate breakfast for half the price, but I guess most hotel food is overpriced anyway. Other than that the rooms were great and the hotel staff was friendly and accommodating, we were issued a pack n play/crib for the baby with no problem too.",4,2013,05,07
211,!,"staying one night in this hotel to go to the Il Divo concert.  found the staff welcoming, and very attentive.  the room was lovely, great shower and lovely toiletries in the bathroom. one of the most comfortable beds I have ever slept in.  they gave us a complimentary breakfast, the newspaper in the morning and when we were leaving having ascertained the long journey ahead of us the receptionist gave us bottled water for the journey -  a lovely thoughtful gesture.  highly recommend this hotel. you will be well taken care of and it is in a very good location for a city visit.",4,2013,05,06
211,Lovely Hotel,"We stayed in the croke park hotel on the 3rd and 4th of may and we had a fantastic stay.The room  was lovely and clean and all the staff were friendly and helpful.The breakfast was very tasty and the bar food also(the soup was delicious).We had Sarah and Danella serving us a breakfast and they were lovely and friendly.My 6 and 8 year old son's loved sarah,they said she made the nicest hot choclate and they were hoping sarah would be in the dining room on our second morning,they were very happy when they seen her there. I loved that you could'nt get up the lift without your key,good security.On our second morning at breakfast my brother and his fiance from Brazil and her parent's who are Brazilan Italian joined us for breakfast and they had a good chat with Danella in Italian,she was very friendly.The room had an ironing board and iron,tea and coffee,presser,air conditioning and a good choice of channels on the tv.when I put up the ""do not disturb"" sign not needing anything for my room they put a note under the door saying  if I needed anything just ask reception which was a nice touch.The reception staff were very nice also and gave us 4 bottles of water for our journey home,nice touch.We had a great stay.",5,2013,05,06
211,"Good experience, helpful staff","Was here before and would have rated it top marks - felt things had slipped a little. Friendly helpful staff at check in with warm towels to freshen up from our journey. Directions to the room were misleading and we had to wander in two different directions to find the room. Room was spacious and very clean. Brilliant shower and really comfy bed. Had an excellent nights sleep.
Breakfast was good although the serving utensils need to be kept clean, other patrons were mixing these all up and using the bean spoon for the scrambled eggs etc and they all looked a bit uugh! Second morning there was a long black hair in the mushrooms but the waitress took the whole pot away without question to replace these.(I think this was from a guest not the catering staff). We were on a package and had a meal our second night. Choice only limited to three starters, three mains and three desserts. Would have liked the option to eat from the other menu or to order steaks with a surcharge. Having said that the mains were very tasty and big enough portions. Veg soup and veg with main were a bit on the bland side but we cleared our plates. Didn't have a dessert,  weren't advised we could order and pay extra so didn't bother.
All in all a fairly good weekend but just think it could loose its brilliance if too complacent. Didn't use gym etc.",4,2013,05,06
211,Super place,"We flew into Dublin and drove to the Croke Park Hotel from the airport. We had a little trouble finding it and stopped a man. As soon as we said the name he was able to tell us how to get to the area where the hotel is located. When we arrived we were greeted by a very helpful young lady and after checking in and parking in the underground parking area we went to our room to find the nicest room with a view of the river walking trail and light rail tracks. The shower was a straight walk in with no stepping up, down or over which is very helpful for someone with mobility issues.",5,2013,05,05
211,Great stay,"We stayed with 3 amigos.  We arrived early at the hotel but despite this the reception was very friendly and are room was already available.  The receptionist arranged it so that we had 3 separte beds wich was nice.  The rooms was very modern with a nice bathroom, mini bar and very comfortable beds.  Dublin is a 15min walk away.  
Breakfast is served in a nice restaurant and the products are a good quality with lots of choice.
This hotel deserves all the credit it gets in the earlier reviews!",5,2013,05,03
211,Nice friendly clean hotel,"Stayed at The Croke Park Hotel between the 29th April and 1st May with my wife. When we arrived the reception staff were very helpfully and told us all about the hotel, the bar, the bistro,gym etc. We had a standard room on the first floor with our booking and was offered the executive upgrade of 30 euro per night which offered a deluxe room on the 4th floor and access to the executive Lounge which we decided to take.
The room on the 4th floor was the same as the room we had seen on the first floor except for champagne on arrival and robe and slippers.
The Executive Lounge was ok, it offered coffee, tea, and a continental breakfast (we had a full irish breakfast already included anyway) and a view which the reception staff told me was great, well if you think looking at a load of houses and metal outside of croke park is a great view then what more can be said. It was a pity though that extra snacks apart from fruit were not offered throughout the day.

The Bistro was very nice and the food as 4star status in the evening, however the breakfast wasn't all that in the morning as it was hot buffet and fish and chip style sausages. 

The bar in the evening offered a range of drinks however at 12pm the bar was closed, staff went home and no more drinks available which was a bit disappointing.",4,2013,05,01
211,Excellent Stay at the Croke Park Hotel,"We stayed at the Croke Park Hotel for 3 nights starting on the 27th to 30th April 2013. We had a family room as my daughter who is 15 also stayed. On arrival we was told that we was to be upgraded to an excutive suite which included contintenal breakfast which was a lovely surprise. We all enjoyed our stay at Croke Park, the staff was so friendly and helpful, nothing was too much trouble. The room was spacious and very clean, the bathroom was lovely and big which is a bonus as most hotels bathrooms are so small you can't swing a cat in. We would say its a good 15 minute walk to the City Centre but to be honest we enjoyed it, at least that way you do get to see the area and the people were so friendly. This was out first trip to Ireland and it certainly won't be the last and we would definitely stay at the Croke Park Hotel on our return visit.",5,2013,05,01
211,Excellent Hotel,"The Croke Park Hotel is an excellent base from which to experience Dublin.  It is about 10 - 15 mins walk to O'Connel St and the hub of the city.  The staff were very helpful and nothing seemed to be too much trouble for them.  Bar food at lunch time was really well prepared and excellent value for money.  We had an evening meal in the hotel and again the food was of good quality, service was first-class and the meal was well presented and very reasonably price.  We were able to check-in early without any problem.  Our room was on the second floor so we were unable to avail of the great view from the fourth floor that other reviewers mentionned.  However, our room was spacios, very clean, neat and tidy.  We were well pleased with our stay and plan to return to the Croke Park in the not too distant future.",5,2013,04,30
211,Excellent stay,"I stayed at this hotel 26 and 27 April.  Very impressive, difficult to find a fault!
Whole hotel immaculate, all staff friendly and helpful and speedy check in and out.
Room very spacious with everything one could need.  Nice to see biscuits for two people, this has been withdrawn from lots of hotels.  Tea/coffee making facilities, nice toiletries, flat screen tv and cd player, CDs available from reception.
Bathroom spacious, towels soft and massive walk in shower with bonus of bath.
We had breakfasts, one lunch and one dinner in hotel. All very good, fruit, plentiful bred, everything one could want for breakfast.  JUST ONE QUERY! WHY IS THERE NO BUTTER KNIFE WITH CUTLERY AT BREAKFAST? ONE KNIFE! FORK AND SPOON - GREAT BIT YOU EITHER HAD TO ASK STAFF FOR ANOTHER KNIFE OR WIPE THE ONE YOU'D JUST USED FOR A FRY TO SPREAD MARMALADE ON TOAST?  BIZZARE!
On checking out today, the girl at reception offered me water for the journey, what a lovely touch.
I was at staying at hotel for a conference but made it a nice weekend too of it. I would stay here again with  no problem.",5,2013,04,28
211,The Croke Park Hotel,"Just stayed here recently for the second time and both times I can't complain, very clean rooms and very nice staff, rooms were nice and quite. Free Parking was the main reason why I chose to stay here as so many hotels try to rip of customers with extortion pricing for parking. Price of the room was very reasonable although the price for breakfast appeared quite high, overall I would highly recommend this hotel.",4,2013,04,28
211,"Clean, modern and functional",Just stayed for the one night but smooth check-in plus clean and modern room. Staff very helpful. I enjoyed a quiet sleep in a large comfy bed in an Executive room. The TV was a bit old and had the usual channels. Hotel is situated on the North side where there isn't much night life but it's only a short cab ride too and from town and it's very handy for the airport.,4,2013,04,27
211,Fantastic Hotel,"Stayed here recently as a treat for my wife and could not have been more impressed. On our very early arrival the staff were very helpful in making sure that we were allocated with our room at the earliest opportunity and provided space to store our bags as well as clear directions to the centre. The staff at this hotel were, without exception, very welcoming and helpful. Our deal included a set evening meal on our first night which was exceptional. The breakfast fayre was varied and fresh. This hotel is not in central Dublin but is only I would say a leisurely 10/15 minute walk to O'Connell St. Highly recommended.",5,2013,04,26
211,Ruth,"I stayed here for one night on bank holiday Monday the 1st of April. The hotel is very modern and clean. We had bar food, the food was ok but the service was very very slow. We were going to see a play in the Olympia theatre, which the hotel booked us a taxi to get into the city for. Our room was clean and modern and very nice but our sink got blocked. We asked at reception on two different occasions for it to be fixed but it never was before we left. We came down for breakfast the next morning and queued up only to be told we hadn't booked breakfast, but we had. I was just about to get the confirmation docket from my bag when myself and my husband were told to go on ahed. We weren't impressed.",3,2013,04,26
211,Wonderful Stay,"Stayed here recently with a friend for a night. The hotel is fabulously decorated, the staff are extremely friendly and helpful! The room was spacious and the bed was very comfy!! We had food in the bar which was lovely and the atmosphere was great! We went to a concert that night in the o2 and the staff at reception organised a taxi for us. Overall, we really enjoyed our stay and will be back! Great work guys!!",5,2013,04,25
211,"Great rooms, helpful staff","My friend and I just stayed here for a night. We were immediately given a room, even though we arrived hours before check-in. Rooms are spacious and are just like any American hotel worth its salt. The hotel is a little out of the way from downtown, but when we asked for a cab to the city, there was someone waiting right outside for us. The staff made our stay extremely easy.",5,2013,04,24
211,Exceptional hotel and industry leading service,"Visited Dublin with a bunch of friends and got a 2 double bed room, which turned out to be really spacious.  I was immediately impressed by the decor and the clean and modern feel of the hotel room.  The beds were comfortable and the washroom had a lot of counter space.  There was a confusion with a breakfast order that we placed and there was a lady that came up to personally apologize and gave us some free sandwiches and juice.  

The front desk service is extremely helpful and assists with the booking of the city tours.  The business area has 2 computers and free printing service.  The wifi is free and is decent in speed.  

The location is a 15 minute walk to the city centre and the hotel is in an area of the city that required us to cab after our nights out.  The only con about this hotel is the room keys demagnetizing all the time.  The gym is also nice.",5,2013,04,23
211,Ireland vacation,"Landed in Dublin from the states in the morning spent the day in the city, before checking in. Everything was great about the staff, the meals and the room. Hotel had all of the proper amenities. Rooms were very tastefully done and looked brand new.
If I had a complaint it would just be the location. It was just a little too far from center city for our liking. If on the other hand you stayed to attend a sporting event at croke park stadium, it couldn't be better since it was right across the street.",5,2013,04,23
211,What  a wonderful staff,"We ended our trip at this hotel  here,  from a CIE  Tour it was the last hotel and extended a couple of days. Russell Hadley was a great manager. we had to add so we couldtake the non stops flights. the wait staff was so helpful and the food was wonderful. We had a lot of support. Due to the town my childen live in Arlington",5,2013,04,23
211,Great value for money,"Great hotel, good rates for fantastic rooms. Not sure about the location, but as my meetings were in Croke Park conference centre just across the street it served me well. 
Great bar, great restaurant.",5,2013,04,20
211,Home from Home,Croke Park is always my chosen hotel for my visits to Dublin. It offers a shuttle bus in the morning to my workplace. The hotel is great with the bedrooms always very clean and tidy and very comfy. Both the room service and bar meals are superb. Nothing is too much And always a great stay.,5,2013,04,19
211,Great service - comfortable rooms - somewhat out of town,"Arrived on the first flight to Dublin from Chicago at 5 am. Wanted a couple more hours of sleep. Official check in not until 3. No problem at Croke Hotel. They had 2 rooms ready and got us between the sheets in no time. Lovely.

Good coffee at the bar for breakfast. 

Rooms are very comfortable. 

A little out of the way of the downtown, but a short bus or taxi (we did both) and walk-able (we did that also - about 20 minutes or so.)

If you need to be right downtown, this is not for you. For all others, this place was great.",4,2013,04,17
211,Glad to be back,"This was my second stay at the Croke Park, this year, and I was very happy to return. As with my previous stay, the room was large, clean and very comfortable. I also had a bar meal which was good. I would not hesitate to use this hotel again, when I am next in Dublin.",4,2013,04,17
211,Superb,"The Croke Park Hotel far surpassed our already high expectations. 
My boyfriend booked a three night stay for my birthday which he happened to mention to the hotel. They very kindly upgraded us to a beautiful room, but it didn't stop there, they displayed a happy birthday banner and balloons in our room and a bottle of wine on the eve of my birthday. The hotel could not be faulted for that 'special touch' and attention to detail.
Every evening when we returned to our room, our huge, extremely comfortable bed had been turned down and a lavender scented 'hottie' was placed in our bed. The hotel was spotless and the staff very helpful and friendly  (apart from an extremely rude barman with a terrible attitude, but even this experience was resolved by the food and beverages manager).  All the other staff we encountered exceeded excellent customer service and we can't thank you enough.
The continental breakfast was delicious which consisted of lovely cheeses, smoked salmon, cold meats, a selection of cereals, pastries and fruits. During the day, homemade biscuits were provided to accompany the variety of hot and cold drinks.
I find it difficult to understand how this hotel is number 5 in Dublin on tripadvisor - it should be number ONE!
Thank you Croke Park for making my birthday so special and memorable",5,2013,04,15
211,Excellent Hotel,"Excellent hotel.
3 of us stayed for 2 nights..
Room was excellent..very clean and everything you need in a hotel room..
Breakfast was fabulous..plenty of choice and as much as you like..
so anyone going to Dublin i would recommend this hotel..",5,2013,04,15
211,excellent hotel within walking distance of the main street,"Hotel has been recently refurbished to a high standard. Checking in was easy and quick even though there was eight of us in the group. We all had a double  and a single bed in our rooms which were very comfy. Big Bathroom and shower.
Breakfast they catered for our group to sit together with ease.  Loverly bar and lounge area to relax in. The walk into the centre was not a problem for us - in fact it was very nice to walk after eating such a large breakfast. .

The only negative point was the weather it was just as cold in Dublin as it was at home - we all agreed to go back to Dublin again and stay at the same hotel but when the weather was warmer.",5,2013,04,14
211,Mgt H,"We stayed hear for 2 nights. The flight arrived early morning and expecting no more than to leave our luggage and head off somewhere for breakfast the receptionist was good enough to let us have our room as it was available.The hotel was excellent. All staff were friendly and welcoming ,nothing was a problem.Breakfast,bar & retaurant meals all excellent.
15 min walk into centre of Dublin. Watch out for taxis outside airport, we were charged 45 euros to get us to the hotel from the airport.Taxi ordered via hotel to airport was 20 euros.
Area surrounding hotel is a bit run down. Would certainly return to Croke Park Hotel.",5,2013,04,14
211,Excellent stay,"My husband and I stayed her over the Easter bank holiday weekend and had an excellent stay, we stayed in a deluxe double which was very spacious and comfortable and had all the extras you need for a break away. We had a double shower and bath and the room and bathroom were finished to a very good standard.
We had the full breakfast and this too was very good with an excellent choice of hot and cold food, service was excellent and it was nice to see local people working in the hotel which is very rare these days, an excellent hotel.",5,2013,04,13
211,Excellent hotel with friendly staff,"I stayed here for two nights whilst attending a conference across the road at Croke Park itself so it was incredibly convenient. The hotel was really excellent. The staff at reception were friendly, welcoming and efficient.  The room was comfortable and spacious. The bathroom was well appointed. The broadband was fast with a simple method of connection that did not require endlessly re-entering a password. As good a system for broadband as I've seen. The food was very good, particularly the breakfasts and the dining room staff were absolutely first class, polite, organised and very, very friendly without ever being intrusive. Just the right approach. 

As mentioned in some other reviews it is about twenty minutes walk to the city centre but there was a steady stream of taxis available. The surrounding buildings are not the world's most attractive but that isn't the hotel's fault. 

Only had one tiny niggle: the signage for rooms on the first floor didn't actually include directions to my room number beyond the first sign on leaving the lift. Thereafter the directional signs completely omitted 144 from their sequences!",4,2013,04,12
211,Ideal for conference stay,One night only forfor conference at croke park next day just a walk across the road ideal. Good room good lounge bar. Only 15 euro taxi ride from the airport. I will be back. Spanish tapas board ideal for nibbles with drink and enough to avoid overeating in the restaurant.,5,2013,04,12
211,Good for business,I stayed here for one night on business. It was convenient for what I wanted but not sure how convenient it would be for city centre visitors. Room is modern and comfortable and internet access and speed was excellent. There was a good selection at breakfast and staff were friendly. Would stay again.,5,2013,04,11
211,Staff was inviting and room was clean...,"The hotel itself is very nice.  Upon checking in we were offered hot towels which was a nice touch.  The room was clean and decorated very nicely.  The room was by far the smallest of the 4 hotels we stayed in in Ireland, but we only spent a night and wanted to get out and see the sights.  You could hear some of the noise outside of the room at times, but we slept well overall.  We dined here with some great live music after touring and drinking through Temple Bar district.  The dinner was prepared very nicely as was breakfast.  It was a little far for the walk into town due to the cold weather.  A cab ride was luckily about 8 euros.  In the warmer months, I am sure the walk would be nice.  For those that are visiting Croke Park stadium, location is excellent.  Overall, it was an enjoyable stay.",4,2013,04,10
211,Excellent hotel,"Stayed at the Croke Park Hotel for 2 nights in April.  We arrived at 8am and expected our room to be ready for 2pm.  What a lovely surprise when we were told our room was ready and if we'd like to go and have breakfast, arrangements would be made for our luggage to be taken up to our room.

Superb buffet-style breakfast with plenty of choice for everyone.  Full Irish, continental and a heap of cereals and breads avaialble.  Staff attentive and nothing was too much trouble.

Our room was a superior double and was spotless.  Super-king bed, flat screen tv and a mini bar with tea, coffee making facilities.  Bathroom was faultless with a double shower, soft towels and a range of toiletries.  Ample hanging and storage space.

Took us about 20 minutes to walk into the centre of town and that's really the only downside to the location of this hotel.

Would I stay here again?  Without a doubt - absolutely perfect and an thoroughly enjoyable stay was had.",4,2013,04,10
211,Excellent Hotel,"We stayed for one night and were very impressed with this hotel. The location is beside Croke Park Stadium ideal if you are going to any GAA Matches or concerts. It is about 20 min walk to city center. The rooms are a good size, modern, clean, warm and nicely decorated with really comfortable beds. The staff were very helpful and friendly and there is free Parking in the underground car park. We would go back.",5,2013,04,09
211,Croke Park Hotel,"Not in the habit of writing there Reviews, but thought the Croke Park Hotel deserved a mention following our recent visit there.  Check-in was speedy and without fuss, nice touch providing guests with hot towels on arrival.  Room was spacious, clean, modern, well-decorated, bathroom facilities excellent, including the best shower I have ever used in a Hotel.  Heating was adequate.  Mini bar was well stocked.  Wardrobe space was more than adequate.  Our every request was dealt with including a request for a room near the lift due to one of the party having walking difficulty.  Breakfast was the best presented, the best variety and the best layout I have seen in a long time, if not ever.  Service in both the bar/restaurant was excellent.  We dined in the bar late evening and the food was exquisite and very tasty.  A special mention has to be given to Teresa on reception.  The little details such meant so much, such as when you ring reception the staff answer with ""good evening mr()"" the bottle of water on departure.  The free parking was much appreciated too.  I will certainly return to the Croke Park Hotel.  Excellent rates for a 4 star hotel.  Overall a most pleasant experience which surpassed my expectations.  Well done to all!",5,2013,04,09
211,Great hotel and the restaurant is well worth a visit,"This was our second visit to Dublin - our first being 9 years ago and while we were disappointed with Dublin itself we were more than happy to have chosen this hotel.
The staff were incredibly helpful and friendly and genuinely went the extra mile in giving fantastic customer service.  Something that many organisations talk about but it's quite rare to see it in practice, so well done to them !
The rooms were very nice with all the facilities you would expect from a hotel of this standard. 
We booked an executive room with access to the Executive Lounge which is where we ate breakfast each morning of our 3 night stay.  The lounge would probably benefit from having a member of staff there throughout the breakfast period as there were a few occasions when things had run out, such as cutlery, bowls, hot water etc and you had to wait a few minutes for someone to appear but overall the breakfast itself was more than adequate.
As the hotel isn't as central as some, we decided to eat in the restaurant on 2 evenings.  The service was exceptional and the waiter even remembered our names which surprised us.  On the first night, we both ordered the duck breast. The waiter returned full of apologies that there was only 1 portion left but offered my husband a more expensive alternative at the same price as the duck.  Both meals were delicious and hence the reason we chose to eat here on our last evening.  This time my husband was able to have the duck and again both meals were fantastic.  
Quite a few previous reviews comment on the location of the hotel and the area being run down.  There's no denying that walking to or from this hotel into the city centre doesn't take you through the nicest parts of Dublin but having said that, we never felt in the least uncomfortable when we did this during the day and we didn't do this at night as we ate either in the hotel or at a friends house.  
There's no question that Dublin is suffering from a very bad recession and we felt that most of the city centre is dirty, unloved and uncared for.  It's very sad as all the people we came in contact with were friendly and great to talk to and find themselves in this situation due to no fault of their own.  It's very sad but hopefully things will get better.  In the meantime, if you are going to Dublin on business or for a holiday, you could do a lot worse than booking into this hotel !",5,2013,04,09
211,Excellent,"Two night stay sat and sun 6th April. Excellent hotel, nice rooms, breakfasts are superb as was the duck and chicken we had for dinner on the Sunday. Large bar offering plenty of quiet seating and big screen area. To all those who say it's not in the town centre -yes it's a 20 minute walk away or a 10 euro taxi (always available) but it's a damn sight quieter than city centre mayhem as a result !",5,2013,04,09
211,A comfortable stay!,"I was pleasantly surprised by how well presented the hotel is. The staff were very welcoming on arrival. We were initially put in the wrong room and informed the staff. They apologised and quickly moved us to the right room and even offered us a free cocktail at their bar for the inconvenience. As we stayed for 3 nights we had no complaints, everything you would need in a hotel room is on offer. I would gladly stay in this hotel again.",4,2013,04,08
211,One night stay - very pleasant,"Stayed one night at the start of April in the Croke Park. Very good price obtained on trivago.co.uk  for bed and breakfast deal at £66.  Hotel bathroom is exceptional - very large, well lit and walk in shower separate to bath. Had a brilliant night sleep - neither my hubbie or I had any problems with a sore back in the morning. Breakfast was very nice and my only wish was for tangerine segments with fruit choice at buffet - free newspaper given on entrance to breakfast. Staff exceptionally friendly and hotel very modern and clean. We had a hire car and wouldn't have fancied the walk ourselves into town. Hotel free wi-fi was a bit slow at 5.30 pm but very fast by the time we came back in at 9 pm.  The Wallace Asti Italian restaurant just a few doors down the road was a lovely place to eat - recommend the bruchetta and mushroom risotto but go early as it got very busy later on.  I would highly recommend the hotel to anyone.",5,2013,04,08
211,Very good hotel,"I've just returned from a weekend (two nights) stay at this hotel.  I was in Dublin for a family celebration. I grew up not far from the hotel so unlike other reviewers I had the advantage of local knowledge and could quickly walk into the city centre.  My twin room was really big. Two double beds and loads of space between them. The bathroom had a bath and a separate large shower.  Everything was spotless something I'm very fussy about.  The room had a flat screen TV and a modern stero, room safe - all free of charge.  WiFi was also free which was great. The beds are very very comfortable. Our room rate included breakfast and it was very good.  I'm vegetarian but the hot and cold buffet had plenty of choice. My sister who was staying with me said her full Irish breakfast was the best she's ever had ! The staff are very pleasant without being insincere and they even let us check out late on the Sunday free of charge. I will stay here again when I'm next in Dublin.",5,2013,04,08
211,Nice qualtity hotel ... noisy though,"Great modern but very comfortable hotel, breakfast is great,  the dinner bar menu could do with more variety,  drink is expensive here.  The only issue I had on the several times I stayed here is that the rooms were not sound proofed and I could hear everything next door! Not really good. being exhausted on a work trip I was able to sleep though,  beds are comfortable and rooms are lovely. I will for sure stay here again It's a little out of the city but in 10 mins bus/taxi you're there.",4,2013,04,08
211,Very new and modern,"My wife and I stayed here for our honeymoon and loved it! It very new, clean and modern. It is a little outside the city centre, so we had to take a bus in everyday, but that is my only complaint. The bus stop was a short five minute walk to the main road. There is a very nice, modern fitness center which is open 24/7. The staff were very friendly and helpful. The breakfasts were traditional Irish food and very good. There was a lounge area with a fireplace, and even a library.",5,2013,04,07
211,Very Nice Facility In Upscale Downtown Area,"This hotel is typical of the better European spots for lodging.  In the U.S., it would likely be a 4 star resort.   There's very good security provided by the limitation of access to the room levels with only a room key.  Although our standard room was quite small, it contained everything you would want or need in a nice hotel room except extra floor space.  The bed was very comfortable.  The bath was upscale with plush towels and excellent accessories.  A highlight for this hotel is that the Hop-On-and-Off City Bus tour picks travelers up directly in front of the hotel.  Travelers should be aware that they will have to make their own way back to the hotel after the bus tour as it does not return after pick-up.  The walk back is about 10-15 minutes, however, and should only cause concern for those with limited ability to walk.",4,2013,04,07
211,Citytrip,"This is the second time I've stayed at this hotel. The breakfast is excellent and the staff are really friendly. The beds were rather small and the hotel is not in the centre, but then it's a bit more quiet.",4,2013,04,07
211,Zoo Trip,"Family of 5 with 2 teenagers stayed in deluxe family room  for one night with dinner and breakfast with a family ticket to the zoo. Fabulous value, fabulous room, fabulous service. Had a great time and will stay again. Thanks for the special birthday surprise!",5,2013,04,07
211,"Great stay!! Great location, staff, rooms, breakfast.",My wife and I took our honeymoon two years late as I am in the military. We booked this trip through europeandestinations.com and that's how we found this hotel. It is located 10 mins from the airport across from the stadium. Checkin was fast and friendly. They upgraded us to the top floor with a king bed on the executive floor as one of our friends from the states called and told them it was our honeymoon. It is just a 10-15 min walk to O'Connel St and city centre. Also the green hop on hop off bus picks you up right at the hotel in the morning. Overall a great stay well within our budget and a great experience!,5,2013,04,07
211,Fantastic Place to Stay in Dublin,"My husband and I stayed at Croke Park Hotel in Dublin and were truly impressed.  The Hotel was a little bit outside of city center, but we are from NYC so we are used to walking everywhere.  The walk was really only a few blocks.  The check in process was easy and even though we arrived super early, they were able to get us into our room quickly so we could get some rest after our overnight flight.  The continental breakfast had a wonderful variety and was a great way to start our days.  The concierge was amazing and so helpful in offering suggestions about what to do in and around Dublin.   The restaurant was just okay... The bar/lounge had better tasting dishes believe it or not.  Although there are many b&b's and hotels closer to city center, there is no question that we would stay at Croke Park Hotel next time we travel to Dublin.",5,2013,04,06
211,"Beautiful facility, but not centrally located","Croke Park Hotel is a beautiful hotel.  The staff is friendly and helpful, the rooms are quite large and well appointed, and the breakfast was wonderful.  If going to an event at the stadium or if using the hotel as a base for car travel outside of Dublin, this hotel is perfect.  Otherwise, it is a solid 20-25min walk through an unattractive section of town (did not feel unsafe though) to any restaurants/central Dublin.  Not an issue for my husband and I, but guests with small children or older guests may find this a burden as public transit not easily navigated by foreigners.  
Bed were very comfortable and we both slept very well.  Of room overlooked the train tracks so the views were nothing to write home about.  The bathroom was spacious and there was an amazing jetted tub which we did not try out.  
Would stay here again esp if we were travelling outside the city.",4,2013,04,06
211,"very nice stay, would reccomend !","first time to this hotel for a 3 night break in dublin
situated accross the road from the croke park stadium.
first impressions of our standard double room- huge bed, nice clean sheets, flat screen tv and cd/radio player, kettle, selection of teas/coffees etc, ironing board/iron, free wifi, mini bar, free safe in room which is easy to programme with personal number of your choosing, air conditioner which i fiddled with to get the heat the way i like it. plenty of wardrobe space but could have had a few more hangers. lovely bathroom with shower, bath and free toiletrys and nice clean towels, couldnt fault the room which overlooked the hotel courtyard below. 
breakfasts are a treat, HUGE selection on offer of cereals, cooked food, fruit, cheeses and meats, juices and the usual... perfect !
we also ate at the hotel in the evening, they have a restaurante and we had a selection of the set menu as part of our stay, the braised lamb was lush but i couldnt eat it all and they were more than happy to wrap it to go which i polished off later in the evening, the puddings were also very nice and the service was excellent. 
we also ate in the bar another evening and again a good selection on offer, the seafood chowder was beautiful and i would reccomend it.
the hotel i couldnt fault and everyone was lovely ,bar one barman who had a bit of a face on him the evening we were in the bar( maybe he'd had a bad day!) 
 there is parking available in the basement of the hotel and its free but you need to get the ticket validated by the reception so that you dont have to pay if you are a guest. you also need to use your hotel room card to use the lift up to the floors.

the hotel is a bit out of town and we walked into o'connel street one evening, it took us about 30-40 minutes to dander in for a mooch about. 
we also went on a tour bus round dublin which i would reccomend. it was 18 euro but for that you got 2 days hopping on and off, we went to trinity which was heaving and also st patricks cathedral (COI) which is worth going around if youre into churches!
the city centre is fab and there is so much to do
anyway if you choose this hotel you wont be dissapointed, i would definitely go back there again!",5,2013,04,06
211,Excellent hotel within walking distance,"My girlfriend and I stayed at The Croke Park Hotel for 2 nights. It is the best city hotel I have ever stayed in. Comfortable, large rooms with all the facilities needed. The food we ordered for room service was top quality and beautifully presented. The restaurant for breakfast was excellent with a great choice and the hotel is only about a15-20 minute walk from the city centre, we walked there each day.

The staff are extremely helpful and friendly and overall I cannot fault the level of service. The rates, having obtained an offer, we're highly competitive and I truly think this hotel is among the best I have stayed in.

If we ever venture to Dublin again, we will definitely stay at The Croke Park Hotel!",5,2013,04,05
211,More than good enough,"My partner and I just spent a couple of days in the hotel and we were more than happy with the service and facilities that the hotel provided. Being on the top floor, we had a good view of the city and Croke Park with the rooms being spacious and well furnished and decorated. Being from the UK, it was good to be able to watch the UK news on the TV in the mornings before breakfast which, although perhaps a bit pricey, was of an excellent standard and one of the best I've had in a hotel. 
We had dinner on one evening within the hotel and the food was impressive whilst also being locally sourced. 

Upon checking out, the concierge was more than happy to look after our bags for the day, as we had a late flight, so that we could roam the city which was very useful for us!
Although there was a gym that was well stocked, an addition of a pool would be nice. However, this did not detract from our experience whatsoever.

If/when I return to Dublin I will be looking to stay at The Croke Park Hotel again. Fantastic accommodation and staff.",5,2013,04,05
211,Very nice,"A really nice hotel just a little way from all the main attractions.  Its a 15 min walk to oconnell st.  Theres a Nice gym wity free weights, cables and cardio equipment.  The breakfast buffet was great and had a huge selection.  
very nice rooms",5,2013,04,04
211,"Nice & Quiet Stay, Although Still Close Enough","Stayed here with my partner during a break to Dublin, from start to finish we couldn't complain. Rooms spacious and spotless, staff friendly each time you would pass by and food you could not fault. Only problem some people may find is distance to centre (15+ mins) although not us.",5,2013,04,03
211,One of the best places I have stayed,"We loved Croke park. We stayed here 3 nights. This was our last leg before flying back to US. We stayed on 4th floor at deluxe room. had access to the lounge which has unlimited access to beverages. there is a continental breakfast served in lounge which is filling.
Best part of the hotel is its location. very close to hotel. near to aircoach or airport bus service, there is shuttle to hop in and out bus. 
I highly recommend staying here. take the shuttle to hop in hop out bus and you can cover dublin in 2-3 days. 
negative- The hotel has no swimming pool, no SPA.. we were very disappointed. also hotel staff could have been friendlier. especially at the bar and restaurant. and concierge service rep can misguide you.",5,2013,04,03
211,Brilliant Dublin Hotel,"I've stayed in a lot of hotels in Dublin recently, due to work, and this has been the best so far. Lovely room, very well designed. Huge bathroom, fab shower. Really, really comfy bed. Food was really fresh and well prepared. Highly recommended. Lovely staff too.",5,2013,04,03
211,First class service with a smile...,We were two couples who had an excellent time.  The Irish breakfast is absolutely 1st Class as was everything about the hotel.  The staff excelled all our expectations as far as customer service.  I don't think we could find any fault in the hotel or its staff..,5,2013,04,03
211,"FABULOUS HOTEL, EXCELLENT STAFF AND FACILITIES",We stayed at Croke Park hotel over the Easter weekend and could not find one fault. Excellent value for money and superb staff and first class service. Lovely cosy bar area with excellent varied very reasonably priced food. The rooms were spacious and spotless with large bath and walk in shower including excellent beauty products. Comfy beds and spotless linens. Nothing was too much trouble for the staff who met your every need with a smile. We loved our stay and will be back for sure. ,5,2013,04,03
211,Great stay,"Very nice hotel on the outskirts of Dublin. Only disadvantage is that it takes 25 mins walk to downtown Dublin and you will have to pass by some dodgy places when it becomes dark at night. The staff is very friendly & helpful and breakfast is lovely. Rooms are spacious for a family of 4. Recommended if you want a nice, quiet stay a bit outside of the busy Dublin.",4,2013,04,03
211,Excellent!,"An excelent hotel, a little bit far from the mading crowd of dublin city center. Very friendfull staff and excellent rooms. An excellent choice for those who like good and quiet hotels. And you can go walking to city center and see Dublin in a very calm and quiet way.",5,2013,04,02
211,Very nice package,"Stayed here through and offer with secret escapes. First of all, the hotel is lovely and comfortable. We stayed in a deluxe room on the top floor. Room was spacious and clean. Had access to executive lounge for free tea, coffee, water, juice, fruit and cookies. Free bottled water in this area was a bonus to take around when exploring. Area round the hotel is OK. Walk into centre takes about 15-20 minutes. Breakfast in the morning is good and the restaurant downstairs is useful. Reception were always helpful and stored out bags for us while we had a last look around before we headed to the airport. Would definitely stay here again.",5,2013,04,02
211,"What a wonderful surprise of a ""package deal"" hotel","We had booked our flights, cars, B & B's thru a package deal with Aer Lingus and we certainly weren't expecting the first night's hotel accommodations to be so excellent.  We arrived in Dublin on a Friday morning . . . in the cold and rain and our first experience of driving on the left side . . . and the front desk people were wonderful about explaining things and finding the various places we wanted to visit.  The room was great and the breakfast was outstanding.  By the time we got back to the hotel from the ""hop-on/hop-off"" tour, we were wet and frozen.  (A side note . . . I understand that there are two of these tours . . . ours from Viator did not stop at this hotel but the other one does . . . check it out . . . the Viator is a good 20 minute walk to the station.)   There is a fabulous little Italian restaurant (I'll review it and give it a 5 star!) just a half block from the hotel . . . Wallace's Asti . . . very reasonable and excellent, creative food.",5,2013,04,01
211,Fantastic Hotel,"I booked this hotel for my boyfriend and I and we stayed there from 23rd to the 25th March 2013. The trip was a surprise birthday present for my boyfriend and the hotel upgraded our room and decorated it as a birthday surprise for him. I thought these were generous and thoughtful touches.

The weather was very cold when we arrived and when I checked in a made a comment to the receptionist that my hands were cold and she provided my boyfriend and I with hot towels. The concierge was brilliant and provided us with information on how to get around the city. We arrived well before we were able to check into our room and wanted to change our clothes before heading into the city. The concierge was brilliant and showed us to the gym where we were able to change in the changing rooms which we were very grateful for. 

The executive lounge was bliss, however when we arrived there were a few loud children running around which I didn't expect, however it only happened that one time and didn't put me off the hotel. The executive lounge offers hot and cold drinks on tap and a continental breakfast until 10:30am. It was really lovely and made the stay extra special. 

The room was fantastic, I couldn't fault it! The bed was so comfy and the bathroom very clean. We didn't have any bubble bath in our room when we arrived so we telephoned reception to see if there was any available and a lady brought a bottle of Radox to us which goes to show how helpful the staff at the hotel are. The breakfast was gorgeous. There was plenty of choice, hot and cold food, and all of the staff were all lovely. There was a complimentary paper offered at breakfast also.

If I return to Dublin I would stay at this hotel without hesitation and I am already recommending it to friends and family!",5,2013,04,01
211,Far away from the action,"Our experience at Croke Park was fine. It was a typical business hotel with average rooms, an above average breakfast and most of the amenities that you might expect. But, the hotel is far away from all of the action in Dublin. Expect to walk at least 25 minutes to get to the River Liffey. If you are coming to Dublin to experience the city, then I would suggest that you look closer in to the city center. 

Again, the hotel itself is fine but I feel that it's location knocks it down a notch.

During our stay, the heat in our room did not work. The hotel provided a space heater, which helped, but we were a bit disappointed by the inconvenience. We also had the dreaded room that is right next to the elevator, so we heard noises all during the night. There's also not a pool or jacuzzi, which disappointed us.",3,2013,04,01
211,"A little way's out, but an excellent stay!","The Croke Park Hotel was the first stop on our 2 week trip to Ireland and London. We got in super early, around 6 am, and were able to check in right away. Parking was super easy, which was very important to us after a stressful first drive on the left-side! The room was very nice. The bed was comfy, and the shower/tub was perfect. Two important attributes when you're jetlagged! The staff was super helpful as well with everything, especially when I had to call down about the eco-friendly key-card light switch. oops :)

It took us about 10-15 minutes to get into Dublin proper from the hotel walking (we enjoy walking and are quick). There are a few restaurants around the hotel, but it's mainly a residential area aside from the park. We ended up leaving early in the morning on most days, spending the whole day in the city, then relaxing in the hotel at night. We didn't feel comfortable enough with the city to walk around at night (I have a terrible sense of direction). Not to say the area is super dangerous, but it isn't in the epicenter of the city, so we didn't want to risk getting lost. Plus, the food at the hotel restaurant is amazing, so I felt no need to leave for dinner! They mark gluten-free/coeliac friendly options on the menu, which is a huge relief for me. We had two great meals there. I'm sure we could've walked at night or taken a cab easily to go into the heart of Dublin, but the dinner was just too good.

I highly recommend this hotel. It feels very urban and modern, and you can get a great rate with great customer service. I'd rather stay at a nicer place and have a longer walk to town, no doubt.",5,2013,03,30
211,Very impressed with Croke Park,"Arrived after a gruelling plane trip. Eyes out on stalks and feeling very tired. Super friendly, helpful welcome at the Croke Park saw us settled in in no time. Restaurant, even on Good Friday, was at full strength and lived up to its promise of good food from quality local ingredients. We were impressed. Our room was well appointed, clean and comfortable and we slept blissfully. The hotel is served by the green bus that takes you on a tour of the city. We were very happy with the convenience and links to the city and the airport. We would stay here again without hesitation.",5,2013,03,30
211,Family time....,"Very nice hotel, little out of town...but right opposite the Croke park stadium ideal for fans of GAA football or major national sporting events.
The hotel is very modern inside and very welcoming, staff are extremely pleasant and accommodating. Just about warrants it's four* status but needs a little care and attention, beginning to look a little tired. 
The bedroom was very clean and tidy, and functional...bathroom spotless, mini bar well stocked and room service and food was excellent.
Had food in the bar next evening..the food was plentiful and of a very good quality and service again excellent., breakfast everything you wanted including free Irish times...car parking around the back was a useful addition, which benefited from a lift direct to the lobby given mobility issues. The overall experience given the price was excellent, but for a experience spend a little extra and check out the westbury 5* hotel in central Dublin, also part of the Doyle collection.",4,2013,03,29
211,50th Anniversary,"50 years ago we went on our honeymoon to Dublin so we decided it would be nice to celebrate our 50th anniversary there. I cannot recommend the hotel highly enough, everything was excellent from the room to the food and especially the service from all areas. The concierge desk was particularly helpful in organising anything we wished to do and a nice touch was the bottled water as we booked out for our ferry return to UK.",5,2013,03,29
211,"Very nice, great staff","3rd time staying here and it has improved. All areas clean, bedroom very comfortable. Nice tea/coffees king facilities. Huge tv and radio/cd player. Breakfast had a large selection. All very nice especially the made-to-order porridge. & poached eggs. ",4,2013,03,29
211,Didn't want to leave.,"I stayed in this hotel one night and was so sad that I couldn't move in for a few days.  It was comfortable, clean, stylish.  We were given access to the fourth floor, which has an executive space where they provide a kind of living room and snacks.  The food was great at both dinner and breakfast.  They have a library of used paperbacks for the taking.  Everyone on staff was helpful and hospitable.  I would definitely stay there again.

One tip:  As this is across from Croke Park, the Irish Football stadium, this hotel apparently gets very noisy and busy on game days.  I would not recommend staying in the hotel when a game is on, unless you're a fan.",5,2013,03,28
211,"Fine hotel, would stay again","Stopped here for 1 night in February, nice enough reception staff and easy check in. Given a room with wet room which was for less able bodied guests. Great shower, good in room facilities with a view overlooking the canal. Was very tired so fell asleep fairly quickly. Breakfast was good, decor in restaurant was modern. Check out was fairly swift with complimentary fruit and water for some strange reason - accepted both and left immediately. Would stop again but the taxi ride into Dublin centre which took less than 3 minutes cost 15 euros, yes Dublin is an expensive city and next time I stop it will hopefully be somewhere closer to my work site. Great city, friendly people, what more can you wish for apart from less expensive prices.",4,2013,03,27
211,Will Return !!,"My girlfriend and I stayed here for 2 nights from the 21st March , staff at reception were very friendly and helpful , our room on the 3rd floor looked out on the Jones's road with excellent views of the Hogan Stand . Our bed was huge and very comfortable , there was lots of wardrobe space , flat screen tv and free wifi , the bathroom had seperate bath and shower and as the weather was terrible it was nice to get back to the room and relax in a comfort . The breakfast was excellent with lots on offer and we had dinner in the hotel bar both evenings with a great menu . We watched the Ireland v Sweden game in the bar friday night on the big screen over the large fire , very cosy even in a busy bar . The hotel is close to both M50 and the city centre so it has easy access . We stayed in alot of hotels in 3 years travelling around Ireland and Europe and this is one of the best , we will stay here when we return to do the Skyline Roofwalk . .",5,2013,03,27
211,Great start to our trip!,"We stayed at The Croke Park Hotel on Mar. 15th, 2013.  When we arrived, we were greeted warmly by a woman at the desk who quickly checked us in and sent us up to our room.  As it turned out, the room was directly across from the elevators, and as it was St. Patrick's Day weekend, we were afraid the location would be loud.  We had been awake for almost 24 hrs. and our family of 4 needed some good sleep.  We asked to be moved to a different room, and were immediately given a new room key, without any grief or hesitation from the staff.  The gentleman who waited on us was very understanding and pleasant about our request.  

This hotel was not in a good location if you are planning on walking around Dublin, but it was a great starting point for our driving trip.  The free car park is a wonderful asset.  The bottles of water given to each of us for our upcoming drive were a nice touch!",4,2013,03,27
211,Good experience,Stayed 3 nights and thought it was a very friendly hotel. Staff were helpful and polite. Good location with easy walking distance to town. However you need to dodge the dog mess on the pavements on the way. The only down side to the hotel was having to walk through the cigarette smoke hallway on the 3rd floor. If there is a no smoking policy then it clearly isn't working. Apart from that I would have no objection to coming back,4,2013,03,26
211,Excellent hotel for a short break in Dublin,"We stayed here for 3 nights and couldn't have asked for a nicer hotel to explore dublin  from,  

First impression of the hotel was slightly taken aback by the massively impressive croke park stadium over the road, but after getting the lift up to the reception from the underground parking, we were impressed the reception is very stylish and modern and clean.

Check in was very pleasent with a nice friendly welcome which is often over looked when busy but not here, plenty of interest in ways he could help with our trip to dublin on maps, advice on best trips and buses. 

Room was comfy and clean well decorated and furnished with a massively comfy bed and relaxing chairs and big bathroom, with all the comforts that you would expect in a four star hotel nice touch of free wi-fi and no hidden charges, we stayed on the fourth floor in the executive rooms which has access to a lounge that you can use with free drinks and fresh fruit and papers.

The morning breakfast was excellent with plenty of choice we had the continental breakfast rather than the irish hot cooked breakfast, but you could upgrade if you wanted, good service with a smile every morning.

We ate in the bar one evening food was very good even tho it was in the bar, it was a relaxed atmosphere with good service, and stayed for few drinks each evening, very relaxing with waiter service.

A great hotel out of the way of the main hustle and bustle of the city but within easy reach of the city by walking or taxi or as we did by car with good free secure parking, dont be put off by the stadium being so close we stayed when their was a game on and we barley noticed it.

If your not sure about this hotel for your trip, dont hesitate you won't regret it, we highly recommended it we would be back if in Dublin again.",5,2013,03,25
211,"Amazing hotel, far from sights:-(","My cousin and I stayed at the Croke Park for the St. Patrick's weekend as part of a prearranged tour. The hotel and its staff are amazing. The room and bathroom was  large, super clean, and well appointed. Chris, the concierge was so helpful that we felt guilty. He called taxis for us, arranged reservations, etc. The included breakfast was varied and plentiful and the restaurant's menu was excellent. Why didn't it get 5 stars? It was too far from the action and the hotel was not within immediate reach of public transport. We had to walk to the parade, quite a walk, as many of the streets were blocked off for that reason and anytime we wanted to go to Temple Bar and Grafton Street, we had to call a cab. Other than that, it was an excellent hotel.",4,2013,03,24
211,Would stay here again,"Stayed here for one night for a work event last May. My room was clean, spacious and quiet. However, my colleague was in a room a down the corridor from and tv from next door kept her awake. She did complain and management requested that her neighhours lower volume. I found breakfast good and would definitely stay here again.",4,2013,03,23
211,Good hotel but not quite city centre,"This is a very comfortable hotel.  The rooms are modern and bright.  The food available through room service is better than average although it was all that was available when we arrived at 9.00 pm.  The breakfast was the standard fare but reasonably good quality. An important advantage of the hotel is the facility for parking and it is close to Dublin airport.  A disadvantage is that it is on the north side of the city centre.  A walk into the centre would take about 40 minutes.    
If you are attending a match or other event in Croke Park the hotel is ideal.  If you are not, it would be worth checking with the hotel if there is an event on during your stay.  Otherwise, it might be nosier than you had expected.",4,2013,03,23
211,"Coeliac friendly, excellent service, great value,tasty food,warm and inviting on a miserable day!","Four of us went for lunch on a wet miserable day. The place is immediately inviting with its stylish colour scheme, cosy areas to sit and chat... and the 'fire' under the screen is lovely! We ate in the bar area which is spacious . The service was so professional yet friendly. I am coeliac and the gf bread was I think the nicest I have eaten out..(i forgot to ask the Brand name) Just to mention there are Irish made crisps on the market that are gf. I was offered a side salad instead of crisps which was very nice. My friends thought their toasties and chunky chips were delicious too. It was such good value for lunch also. ( we stayed chatting and eating for hours)We are all locals, so it will become a 'regular' for us I think!!",5,2013,03,23
211,Ok Hotel in Dublin,"This hotel was sports themed and right next to the Croke Park Stadium, which was kind of cool, but the staff sort of left you alone to figure things out yourself, and the room was extremely loud at night.  It sounded like a vibrating phone ring tone off and on all night, and there were clicking sounds that made us think someone was trying to open the door with a key card (which they weren't, but it sounded like it.)  The room itself was nice, although we had one double bed and one really small single bed instead of one larger bed for the two of us. The hotel restaurant was very good, but I would describe the food as unhealthy comfort food.  We did enjoy sitting by the fire to watch a football game at the bar in the evening. It was also fairly centrally located.",3,2013,03,20
211,excellent service,"we recently stayed here for my husbands birthday, they amde our stay special right from check in.  Our room was ready on arrival, and we were greeted with warm towels to freshen up. The check in was friendly and warm and even offered up tickets to the game on at croke park. We went out foer a little while and on our return, theu had put champagne in the room to congrulate my husband on his birthday.
Dinner was lovely in the bar that night, great childrens menu, and breakfast the next day was gorgous, especially with a family to feed, ther was plenty of choice.
Thank you for a lovely stay.",5,2013,03,20
211,Excellent value for money and location,"The hotel is a great stopping point for those coming from the airport as they don't have to go to far into the city (when learning to drive on the opposite side of the road). In addition, for those from the area, it's right across the street from Croke Park Stadium, so it's the perfect place to stay when watching or attending a game. The hotel is in a neighborhood or backs up to one, but it was relatively quiet the night that we stayed, even though there was an afternoon soccer game. We were able to walk a few blocks to the Dublin on/off bus stops and ventured through the city without worrying where the car was parked or what direction we were going in. The hotel itself has most all the amenities you would want. Bathrooms were spacious and more then adequate and the bedroom was spacious and comfortable. In addition, opt for the breakfast, it will save you some money when staying. It's not the greatest (more like a continental, with cold items only) but you can at least fill up. PLUS they have small water bottles that you can take on your excursion. The front desk staff and conceirge were more then helpful in getting us to our next destination. Would absolutely stay here again without hesitation.",5,2013,03,19
211,Great value for money,"We recently visited Dublin for a weekend and booked the hotel based on the reviews of trip advisor . The hotel was modern and very tastefully decorated . The room was spacious and comfortable and was exceptional value for money. Whilst the hotel is not in the city centre , it is only a 10 minute walk down to the City centre . Although we were recommended to get a taxi at night! The hotel staff were helpful and could not do enough to help us. When we visit Dublin again, we will certainly stay again at this hotel",5,2013,03,17
211,"Great price,easy access to the city!","This hotel was perfect, it's a very nice hotel just outside downtown near the stadium. The rate was great we booked online which gave an upgrade to the exec level which had continental breakfast. We used the hop on hop off sightseeing bus to tour dublin so we didn't have to drive in the city and there is a shuttle from the hotel to the start of the bus line or its just a 7 min walk! Customer service was excellent we got into to DUB at 5:25 and were lucky enough to get to check into our room at 7:30am and take a quick nap before starting our day. One note my adaptor did not work in their plugs but it worked everywhere else in Ireland, we just asked at the desk and they gave us one to use during our stay!",5,2013,03,16
211,Excellent hotel.,"Stayed here for two nights on a  girls break away. Rooms were beautiful and clean, the food excellent and the service spot on, even down to waiting for a taxi in lobby we were offered a hot chocolate while we waited and a box of chocolates on our last night with the friendliest of staff, would definitely recommend and will be returning soon.",5,2013,03,15
211,Great Hotel,This is my third visit to this hotel and i love it.Rooms are very comfortable with large bathrooms.All the staff are very good and food is excellent.The hotel has free underground parking and is only 5 mins the city center,5,2013,03,15
211,Excellent service from staff,"We booked based on reviews, and were not disappointed. From check in to check out, it was very efficient. The desk staff were very, very helpful - booking taxis, morning wake up calls, giving directions, even changed up 100 euro notes when we couldn't get them changed elsewhere. The bedspread was a bit stained, I called and it was changed. One night there was some confusion with the taxi driver as to who booked it. The lady at the front desk actually came out to talk with the driver to get it sorted for us.

 We were on the 4th floor, and the continental breakfast was included, lots of choice and delicious.

Did the green bus tour, took the shuttle from outside the hotel (one pick-up time, 9:30). Bought the ticket at the hotel, cost less than buying on the bus.

This had a boutique hotel feel (not like one of the larger impersonal hotels) and was not intimidating the way some better hotels can seem. Also felt secure, you need our key card to go to any floor in the elevator, and when we came back to the hotel a bit late one night, a staff member checked that we were guests (politely though).

Had no trouble with location, I didn't mind walking alone in the daytime and even after my husband and I left a pub and walked back.

Overall the hotel was great, the staff make it excellent, would highly recommend it.",5,2013,03,14
211,No complaints here!,"It may be next door to a massive sports stadium, but  in Dublin that a big bonus as all the  followers of the Gaelic games will tell you. This is a smart hotel  hotel with friendly helpful staff and nice relaxed feel. Modern in style comfortable, with a nice ambiaence you soon slip into comfort mode. The food in the sideline bistro  is good and the sideline bar is a great place to hang out. I can't wait to go back!",5,2013,03,13
211,a little out of the way but comfortable,My father and I stayed here for 6 nights and enjoyed our stay. I would say it s a 3/5 stars.. rooms are of good size and we had a large bathroom with a soaking tub and separate shower. The bar staff is friendly and the food is decent at best. The desserts are great and the wine list is solid. Breakfast gets old after a few days. Concierge Stephen is great. The hotel is about 10-15 minutes walking distance so if you don't want to hoof it then be ready for a taxi. I would stay here again.,3,2013,03,12
211,A lovely hotel that let us down a bit,"This is a very nice hotel, well maintained, good service.  The location is not perfect but its only a 15 minute walk into O'Connell St.  However during our stay we were disappointed by breakfast as it felt there were not enough staff - we waited ages for someone to take our coffee and toast order and in the end I went to find someone.  The plates were not very clean either.  In addition we had a defective shower and it took three attempts to get it fixed, so two days with barely luke warm water.  Lastly beware Gaelic match days when the stadium empties into the hotel after the games - it then becomes extremely difficult to get bar food and drinks.",3,2013,03,12
211,very very nice,"The Croke Park is a great place to spend a weekend in the city. They enjoy an enviable location overlooking Ireland most iconic sports stadium and are close to both the airport and the city center. A great place to enjoy the city while having some peace and quiet at the same time. the layout is quite modern and spacious, beds are very comfortable.",5,2013,03,12
211,Great hotel,"Excellent stay. Highly recommend the executive rooms. Staff very friendly. Great food and services. Perfect as we had a conference to attend in Croke Park. Would definitely stay here again if I needed to stay on that side of the city. 
      ",5,2013,03,11
211,FANTASTIC HOTEL,"This is a gorgeous hotel.  Service, room quality, breakfast, second to none.  I got a fantastic full breakfast  included , sole occupancy, deal from Travel Republic.  There were a few group/hen weekends there but I heard absolutely nothing and slept like a log.  Free wifi and an ice making machine in the corridor are the sort of thing I really appreciate.  

The only drawback I would point out is the location.  Not so much distance from city centre as the walk is only 20 mins or so.  However in the dark it is a through a really dodgy part of town.  I walked back early on a Saturday evening and wouldn't again.  Street lighting is seriously crap in places.

So factor in taxi fares from city centre at night.  If that isn't an issue for you or you have your own transport I cant recommend highly enough.  Reception got me taxis within 5 mins when I needed them.

Finally if you are arriving by Airport Aircoach ask to get off at Quinn's Pub in Drumcondra Rd from where the hotel is only a 3 or 4 minute walk.  Cheaper and quicker than going into the Bus station and back again.",5,2013,03,09
211,Excellent hotel with friendly staff and huge breakfast,"Spent 2 days midweek staying at the hotel as part of group of 14. 
The staff were very friendly and helpful, rooms clean and well equipped. Loved the large stand alone shower.
Spent time on the large sofas in front of fire on last afternoon recovering with no pressure to leave!
Added bonus was we could get into our rooms at 11.15 on our arrival.
Breakfast was eat all you can, and we certainly did!",5,2013,03,09
211,Wonderful Hotel!!,"I Stayed for 4 nights at this hotel, I thoroughly enjoyed every minute of it! 
Check in was nice and easy, friendly and very helpful staff, safe and secure. Had a wonderful room on the 2nd floor, large shower and bath with massive mattress and view of the canal. 
The cleaners were excellent, the place was always gleaming!!  
Had a meal and a pint (or two) in the bar area, great food,comfortable!! all staff were incredibly efficient and friendly. Breakfast was great too! 
It was a 10 minute walk to upper O'Connell street,and from there you can go anywhere you like. 
visited all the main attractions, didn't take one cab or bus (except to and from the airport), so all is in walking distance!! 
check out was easy, the staff couldn't do enough to help!
I had a wonderful stay here, and when I return, I will definitely be staying here!",5,2013,03,08
211,Brilliant!,"One of the best hotels I have ever stayed in. Rooms were spacious with nice big beds. We were on the Executive level so had access to the executive lounge where there was tea, coffee, juice, fruit and biscuits available any time. Tea & coffee making facilities were also available in the room. Breakfast was excellent with all the expected foods for a hot buffet breakfast but there was also a selection of pastries, yoghurt, cereals, cold meats & cheeses etc in the executive lounge if you didn't feel like going to the restaurant. 
Staff were friendly and helpful and the extras such as the hot pack delivered every night at bedtime and free newspaper on the door every morning made our stay extra special. 
The area is about a 15minute walk to the Main Street but there are bus stops and a train stop closer. I wouldn't say it was the nicest area of the city - the streets were quite dirty and unattractive but if you can live with that, there is no better place to stay in Dublin.",5,2013,03,07
211,Excellent Hotel,"This is the second time I have stayed at this hotel, Rooms where great, bedrooms where really comfy, bathroom had a bath and a shower and were pretty spacious. Breakfast was lovely. I have no complaints at all.",5,2013,03,07
211,"Good hotel, great staff!",We were in Dublin for a long weekend celebrating my husbands birthday. We had booked via Secret Escapes and this hotel lived up to the high standards we expect from these deals. Arrived on a very early flight so was at the hotel to drop off luggage by 8.30. Not expecting to check in but pleasantly surprised by the option to use the executive lounge and have a continental breakfast at our leisure. Our room was ready by 10.30 which was fantastic to be able to chill out before exploring the city. The staff could not do enough for us and the concierges were extremely helpful and friendly. Rooms were spacious and had everything we needed. If I had one (very minor!) criticism it would be the location is a little further than ideal but Dublin public transport is very good. Would highly recommend this hotel!,4,2013,03,04
211,Fantastic Value!,"Booked two nights here via Secret Escapes at £59 per night Bed and Breakfast per room.  Would have been great value at double the price - and in London for the same quality you would triple/quadruple that price!  
The hotel is a short (appx 10 minute) walk from the heart of the city and in a quiet location.  The rooms are spacious and comfortable with large, fully equipped bathrooms .  Breakfast was very good with a wide range of choices served buffet style.  All good quality and staff could not be more helpful - booking taxis, giving directions, helping with recommendations and reservations across the city.
The hotel was extremely busy on the Saturday night due a game in the adjacent stadium but the staff were more than up to the task and other than a fantastic buzz in the lobby and bar area our bedroom was peaceful and quiet even with windows open.",5,2013,03,04
211,Comfy and clean,"Great spot! There is an exceptionally friendly staff in all roles. The beds were fine and there was plenty of space to spread out. Not a biggie, but I did not like the towels as they did not absorb anything! I had my hair in a towel for a half hour and it was still dripping wet. The wireless was down, that too was a small convenience. Breakfast was wonderful - lots to choose from.  It was a fine hotel for one night.",4,2013,03,03
211,Short City Break,"We spent 2 days here last week. Could not fault the hotel  -excellent room and bathroom. The staff were all so helpful and friendly - the welcome was fantastic! Ate in the restaurant both nights - very efficient service and tasty food. Lunchtime snacks in the bar also very good. The hotel is a bit out of the city centre but at 9.30am. every morning a shuttle takes you from outside the hotel to the 'hop on hop off ' tourist bus - well worth it if you're a first-timer - also buy your bus ticket in the hotel at a discount.Hotel also has a free car park.
Thankyou also to Secret Escapes and Achica for such a great bargain!",5,2013,03,02
211,Excellent hotel and great staff- highly recommended!,"My family  spent 3 nights here to celebrate my mums 70th birthday (15th - 18th Feb 13) The staff went way beyond our expectations to make it special - if your going for a special occasion let them know before you go.  Hotel very handy to find coming in from the north of Dublin, free secure underground car park, lift up to reception and a quick check in with super friendly staff.

You get a swipe card to use the lifts, the doors to the stairs and your room.  This is great because it keeps the hotel really safe- you can't get upstairs without one.  In other hotels these swipe cards can be a nuisance but these ones work and are easy to use.

The rooms are a great size and really fancy  and have everything you need- hairdryer, tea/coffee facilities, tv and music system!! The bathroom is lovely with a large shower and bath.  It is stocked daily with lovely toiletries.  The beds have the thickest mattress I have ever seen - super comfortable- i wanted to take the bed home with me!!

The hotel is looking directly onto the Croke park stadium - it is directly across the road.

Breakfast is €9.99-€14.99 and children were free.  It was lovely and you could eat as much as you like- worth it in my opinion.

I didn't have any other meals but the bar / restaurant etc looks lovely.

We bought our hop on/hop off tickets at reception - you get a discount.  (Green bus - highly recommend this to). The bus starts down in the city centre but runs a shuttle bus to take you to the first stop free from this hotel - right outside the front door!

We got a taxi back one night (taxi bus for 8) and it was €12  (taxi rank on upper o'connell street). We also walked one day too.  Some reviews say its a dodgy area- we didn't walk about it at night but the day we walked the area looked fine to me.

On checkout we were each given bottles of water for our journey home - nice touch I thought.

Bottom line - super helpful and friendly staff from the reception, restaurant and cleaners.  The hotel is really lovely , in excellent condition and super clean.  If I go back to Dublin I will definitely be back to stay here- couldn't recommend it enough!!!",5,2013,02,27
211,Lovely hotel!,"We were here for a concert in the O2 last year, it was very handy to get to the o2 and a short walk from O' Connell street. Its lovely hotel would definitely stay again! great meeting place on match days also!",5,2013,02,27
211,Great Base to relax,"I stayed during mid term break with hubby (who works nearby and will be back)and the kids. I read another review where someone complained about ""looking out on a grey stadium"". I have to say as a culchie and gaa fan, looking out onto croke park lifted my spirits. My kids thought it was fantastic. Thats something you can only understand if you are Irish. I can only imagine the buzz here when your team are getting ready for an All-Ireland.
Room was really spacious, breakfast delicious and concierge was so friendly and good craic.
Now not to repeat all the previous reviews. For a more relaxed shopping experience head towards Santry omnicentre and take the 16 bus. Theres a mcd's there too if you have little people with you.
You can order breakfast in your room for €5 extra and its worth every penny. Gorgeous breakfast. If you arrive cold and hungry and dont like eating in hotels walk out the front door and walk five minutes to your right for a lovely Italian restaurant. Affordable authentic and on the doorstep of the hotel. (Cant rate the hotel's restaurant as only had breakfast there).
You can buy a family day pass for the bus in the Centra on Drumcondra road and travel as much as you like. (12 euro)  So much to see here.
Great to come back to staff who look happy to see you. Sit in the hotel bar with good friends and a glass of wine and you will find no reason to leave the hotel. I WANT to come back.",4,2013,02,27
211,VIP 40th birthday treat - didn't want to leave....,"I stayed with my mum for my 40th birthday 24th to 26th February 2013.  The stay from beginning to end was excellent. We got off the aircoach from Belfast and on arriving realised a really big match was on at Croke Park. Even through the entrance was busy we got checked in quickly by a lovely young man called Stephen and we were in our room on the second floor in no time. We'd just arrived at our room when the phone rang and we were being given tickets to the match! It was a very pleasant way to spend the afternoon and on coming back to the room we found some bubbly and glasses waiting for us! The room was beautiful and quiet with CD player minibar and TV. Very spacious. We booked dinner in the Sideline Bistro (part of our package) and the 2 course meal was exquisite. I had the chowder and salmon. The whole experience was lovely and the staff were very attentive. We visited the concierge for tips of how to get to St Michans,etc  and he was very knowledgeable.

Again, breakfast was part of our deal, and we had a relaxing breakfast both mornings. There was a wide range of continental and cooked food and we were given an option of types of coffee - my latte was great. I am able to come back to the hotel again I will make sure I have all my meals in the bistro as it was top-class.

Our room was kept spotless throughout our stay by the friendly cleaning staff. On our return from shopping in Grafton St I played a CD on the player in our room and we got ready to go see a theatre show. We got a taxi from outside the hotel and they were very reasonable. 

We got a fantastic deal on Travelzoo - just a pity we didn't have time to make use of one of the vouchers. A big thank you to all the hotel.",5,2013,02,26
211,Good Quality Hotel,"Visited this hotel on a two night package with my better half. The hotel deserves its current good reviews as it is a very well run establishment. The rooms are comfortable and spotlessly clean.
The breakfast was excellent and the dinner we had on both evenings was quiet good. We both thought the quality of the full Irish breakfasts were first class.
The staff without exception were pleasant and helpful. Is is possible to walk into O'Connell Street in about 15 minutes if you are reasonably fit. The nearest bus stop we found to take us into the city or to the airport was on Dorset Street about 10 minuts walk away. The hotel is directly across the road from Croke Park which is a major sports stadium and dominates the skyline. As a result this hotel may be busy when there are sporting events on which is generally at weekends.
Recommended.",4,2013,02,26
211,. Friendly. Spotless. Lovely Food. Excellent staff,"Stayed 22-02-13 to 24-02-13. Couldn't ask for better especially at the price we paid. Well done all round. Room was spotless. Air condition worked efficiently and quietly. Decor was clean, bright and modern. Staff were very nice, friendly and helpful. Free national paper in lobby. O'Connell Street was a 15 minute walk away. Saved on taxi's and bus fares.
Definitely stay again.",5,2013,02,25
211,Good value for money and good service,"Stayed for two nights at the Croke Park hotel. This is our third time to stay at this hotel and we have always left feeling we had a comfortable stay and received good value for our money(booked deal through trivago.ie). We had a nice clean room on the third floor. The room was a decent size for two people and contained a double bed and a single bed. The bedroom and bathroom was clean and the bed was comfortable. Slippers and bathrobes were available. Didn't find the air-con too loud and the temperate was perfect. The shower is a good size with the correct amount of water pressure.

The flat screen T.V. was free-standing and had a good dent in the side of it; evidence from a previous fall. The only downside to the room was the fact that the doors are not very well insulated. As we weren't too far from the lifts (elevators), we could hear people talking as they passed.

We ate in the restaurant on the Friday evening and the food was very good and reasonably priced. We asked for the cocktail menu and after choosing our drinks, the waiter informed us that not all of the ingredients were in stock at the bar. They didn't have all the ingredients for my second choice either so I gave up on the cocktails and stuck to a pint of lager. The bar is always buzzing with activity and there is a nice seated area in front of a big screen. Ideal as there was a rugby match of interest on view.

We called down to reception to book a taxi on the Saturday evening and the receptionist made the booking. After waiting a few minutes we proceeded down to the reception area. No sign of any taxi so I asked the receptionist and she said it would be outside in a few minutes. After waiting 15-20 minutes, and still no sign of it, I asked another member of staff at reception and he called the taxi who appeared within 30 seconds as he was waiting for a booking near the hotel. Either the receptionist or the taxi company were at fault.

The buffet breakfast on both mornings was very good. We were given complementary bottles of water upon our departure. Parking in the underground carpark is complementary for guests. Overall we were very satisfied with our stay and we will return again. 
We visited the Croke Park Stadium Museum (History and information on Gaelic Games) afterwards which was very interesting.",4,2013,02,25
211,Outstanding Value,"I Stayed for two nights and found everything to be without fault. Thanks to a special offer, I paid €96 per night B & B and felt this to be outstanding value. The room was large and immaculate, as was the bathroom; but it was all the little touches from the staff which set this hotel apart. I would highly recommend it to anyone.",5,2013,02,25
211,TERRIFIC HOTEL,"Croke Park Hotel is an amazing hotel.  The service was explempary, the staff were so nice and accomadating. The amenities that came with the booking ie, breakfast, free parking, free wi-fi, 24hrs access to the Executive lounge and the complementary drinks vouchers were really just the icing on the cake of this luxury hotel.  

While it may not be located smack in the centre of town it is close enough to walk to all the main attractions, O'connell Street, Temple Bar, etc.  

I would also like to thank the staff, which was very helpful when my little girl got sick. 

I can't say enough good things about this hotel.  Having stayed at several hotels for both personal and professional reasons, I can honestly say this is one of the best.  

Great job!",5,2013,02,25
211,Brilliant stay with amazing staff,"We stayed here for 2 nights this weekend, we were greeted by friendly staff who were very excited about our recent engagement. We went to drop our bags as we arrived early morning and were very surprised they offered us a room for the day untill ours was ready. 
The concierge was very helpful and polite.
On our first night we are in the bar and enjoyed a lovely meal very yummy with huge chips :)
Rooms were gorgeous and clean and whole hotel was very smart.
We didnt mind the walk into the centre kept us fit !!
Would definitely use this hotel again .",5,2013,02,25
211,Great Place Great People,"We spent a long weekend last week at the hotel and we had a really great time. It was my partners David's birthday and the hotel put up a ""Happy Birthday"" banner and ballons in the room. The staff were excellent and always smiling and could not have been more helpful. I recommend the deluxe room as you have access to the executive club, although the standard rooms are better then most other hotels deluxe rooms.

The full Irish breakfast was excellent with a wide variety of hot and cold buffet items, together with extra choices fron the menu. We also had a great birthday dinner on Monday night and the biggest coincidence was having two David Swifts (Swifty's), my partner and the young waiter - see photo below.

Thank you to everyone for making our stay so special, we would not  hesitate to recommend your hotel to everyone",5,2013,02,24
211,"Nice hotel, service could be better","We booked a one night stay at this hotel using Secret Escapes. On arrival we were given a Standard Room even though our booking was for a Delux Room: we called and asked if we were in a Deluxe room as it looked different than what we expected. A very apologetic man came upstairs and handed us the keys to our room on the executive floor, which we found roomy enough, clean and comfortable. What struck me was that we may have ended up in a cheaper accomodation for the whole stay had we not enquired about the room.

We also had some issues with the night staff: we had chosen to purchase what is advertised as a ""Movie and Treat package"" which includes some snacks and a movie from the hotel's extensive on demand library. We were told we has to go downstairs to swipe a credit card or the system would not let us watch a movie, so we had to go downstairs at 1am to sort this out. It took a few minutes of fumbling, then we were assured out snacks were going to be sent up and that we could go and enjoy the movie. They also made us choose from a selection of currently available ice-cream, only to phone us in the room to let us know the selected flavour was not available.
Unfortunately when we tried to watch the movie we were not allowed as ""purchases were disabled"". Cue another staff member coming to our room to mess around with the cables to declare after 10 minutes that he could not fix the issue.

He told us he was going to remove the charge for the ""Movie treat"" from the room and went his way.

All in all I had to interact way too much with the staff to have a relaxing stay. I also never received either the fruit platter everybody on the Executive floor was getting (I literally saw a person doing the rounds of the rooms with platter, and he never came to our room), nor the advertised turn down service with lavender scente hot water bottle.
Really felt like going to stay with a voucher offer made me into a second class guest, which should never happen.

Having visited both types of room I would also like to state that the Deluxe rooms don't have the promised extra fluffy bathrobe, but exactly the same as the standard rooms.

One last but not least thing for the environmentally conscious traveller:
-the fish tank at reception needs to be maintained better, have less fish in it or be smaller: fish are living creatures and deserve a healthy environment.
-The hotel would do well to stock bigger bottles of water instead of the small ""child"" bottles which are terribly wasteful and not good for the environment.
-If the hotel wants to be recognised for environmental efforts such as trying not to overwash towels it should also avoid waste of electricity: I visited the lounge at 1am and all the lights and the TV were on. A bit silly and definitely a waste.

I do however wish to point out a few good things about the hotel:

-excellent bar with professional staff, good food and good pricing.
-lovely breakfast selection of continental and English breakfast, with cheerful and professional staff (would like to single out Daniela as particularly professional and attentive)
-lounge on 4th floor very comfortable, with a small selection of drinks and fruit. 

Would probably not stay again, especially not at rack rate, as the service from the hotel staff was lacking: shame as the bar and breakfast staff is so professional.",3,2013,02,24
211,A reasonable stay,"Stayed at the Croke the other day, it was good  but certainly nothing to get excited about. It was clean and comfortable, but the rooms were a little small, bathroom a little tired, a little steep and walls very thin which meant we could here the couple beside us having a fall out (something about making her walk back and being too cheap to get a taxi, pretty hilarious).

It looks like they try hard, but I'd definitely recommend this to a business traveler rather than a weekend breaker. I'd suggest staying a little closer to town, you could probably still get something of this standard for a similar price!

My 3 star review isn't ""Average"", it's ""Good"". 4 stars is ""Very Good"", which this hotel is not.

Cheers!",3,2013,02,24
211,Simply wonderfully,"Just back from croke park hotel this hotel is fantastic ,rooms are fab also had access to the executive lounge which was great with fresh tea and coffee all day and the homemade cookies are to die for .Staff are so friendly stay in this hotel if ever in dublin highly recommend it.",5,2013,02,24

211,Fish are not a design feature,"I stay here on business quite often. This is a good, decent hotel. Anyways clean and comfortable. The front desk and housekeeping staff are very helpful, the restaurant manager is excellent, the bar and restaurant staff are a bit hit and miss, as is the food.  

I was dismayed recently to see a small fish tank with too many fish in and not properly maintained on the front desk. When I asked I was told it was to add to the design.  Fish are living creatures, not a design feature!  Either build in a massive, purpose built tank and have the fish professionally looked after and not over-stocked, or don't have any at all.   Please find them a good home and stick to what you're good at, running a decent, clean, friendly hotel.",3,2013,02,23
211,Amazing stay at an amazing hotel,"So, I am a big fan of the Doyle Collection brand of hotels and the Croke Park is one of the best I have stayed in.  The service and friendliness of the staff makes you feel like a celebrity in your own home.  It's comfortable, and yet you are exceptionally well cared for.

The Sideline bar is a great hangout with exceptionally good food.  

Next time we come back to Dublin, this is where we will stay.  No question.",5,2013,02,23
211,Fantastic,"Great place to stay. Clean & Comfortable. Breakfast lovely. Very friendly staff. Superior room good size, bed very comfy. Great power shower. Absolutely no complaints about this hotel "",. Short distance in taxis to centre of city",5,2013,02,23
211,Fantastic and relaxed stay at croke park hotel,"we have just got back having spent a 2 night stay at croke park hotel, we got a great deal in our opinion for a very nice hotel, the reception staff on arrival made us feel very welcome and the lady who dealt with us couldnt have been more helpful after arriving on an early morning flight we werent sure our room would be ready but she did her best to accomadate us and did which was great so we could unpack and freshen up before our day around dublin, so a great start to our stay.
our room was spotless and very comfortable we also in with our price had access to the exec lounge we were had coffee before venturing out into dublin and you could have soft drinks and continental breakfast in there too or just relax and watch tv or have a read of the complimentary news papers.
on our second evening we ate in the sideline bistro staff were excellent and again couldnt do enough to help, service and food was excellent, with a lovely setting 
the bar was a large room which had an american feel to it, very laid back with comfortable seating area were you could have a bar meal or snack or just simply a cocktail or beer and relax, where also they have a large screen showing sport.
again a lovely atmosphere and staff excellent..
we really enjoyed our stay at the hotel, and usually when on a long weekend break would only use a hotel as aplace to sleep we felt so relaxed we did spend both evenings having a couple of drinks ending our busy days..
This is an excellent hotel tho a 10min drive/taxi ride into the shopping area/busy bars..but this did not put us off, would definately stay again and highly reccomend...",5,2013,02,22
211,Very nice hotel,"I had a business trip in Dublin and arrived at the hotel late, we were met by a friendly and efficient receptionist, the rooms and bathroom were very nice and the shower was great. Had a great nights sleep, very comfortable bed. We left early the following morning so did not spend too long or use much of the services but would definately stay again. ",4,2013,02,22
211,Fantastic Hotel and Staff,Just spent 3 days in Dublin. First time we have been here and really enjoyed the stay. The Croke Park Hotel and all of it's staff made this a really pleasant stay. Very helpful friendly staff. Spotlessly clean first class rooms. Great value for money. Food was of the best I have tasted and the breakfast sets you up for the day. A big thank you to all for a very memorable short break in Dublin.,5,2013,02,22
211,Valentines Night Charity Ball,"We stayed for one night on Feb 14th for Charity Ball in Croke Park across the road. Complimentary parking in car park directly underground was most convenient. Room was warm and welcoming just like the girl on reception desk. WIFI was a little complicated but got there eventually. Cupid is obviously not a regular visitor to the Doyle Hotel Group. Slightly disappointed that there was no 'Valentines' theme in the hotel. Chocolate on the pillow or a romantic flower display in the foyet. Not a rose or love heart in sight. Breakfast was excellent and free newspaper was relaxing over a frothy latte afterwards. 
But management take note - ladys in ball gowns dont appreciate gin & tonics in half pint beer glasses. Barstaff need retraining after busy football season!!!!",4,2013,02,20
211,Great Hotel,"I booked this hotel after reading all the reviews and must say it lived up to the hype.
Faultless rooms,service and food which made our stay in Dublin very enjoyable and a pleasure to go back to the hotel aftre a long day sightseeing (Gunniess drinking !!).
Thanks to all staff for there excellent service.
We found the walk to and from the hotel a pleasant experience.",5,2013,02,20
211,Excellent hotel,"We stayed here on Friday 15th February in a superior room. We were provided with slippers, dressing gowns, water and fruit in our room which ahd a double and single bed. Bed was very comfortable and room was a nice size. Bathroom had both shower and bath. As part of our package we had access to the executive suite on the 4th floor. There was water, tea and coffee available at all times and a continental breakfast in the morning. Breakfast in the restaurant was lovely although it did seem to get very busy with long queues coming up to 10 o'clock so be early! Overall we had a lovely stay and would definetly go back again.",5,2013,02,19
211,Highly Recommend - Lovely Hotel,"We have just returned from a two night stay at the hotel and can not recommend the hotel more!
Well decorated, great staff, pleasant environment, large bedroom with a fantastic bathroom, everything very clean.

I agree it is a good walk out of the centre but we didn't find that a problem.",5,2013,02,19
211,Yet again a most wonderful stay,"I stayed here on Tue 12th February with my husband and daughter, staff here are so helpful and pleasant.  The rooms are spotless and the food has always been delicious. We find that the food is reasonably priced and standard of food is very high. We find that we return to hotel after check out to collect our luggage in afternoon and head to the bar to have food before we head home. We love returning to this hotel and are already planning our return in June. Book this hotel, you will not be dissapointed.",5,2013,02,18
211,Excellent hotel,"I have stayed here on a number of occasions over the past few months. (Mostly on business but my wife and daughter joined me last week). It is a great hotel. Staff are excellent. Rooms nicely sized, clean and fresh. Free parking and wifi. Food in the bar is a little price but reasonable quality. Overall I really like the hotel. It is a taxi ride from city centre but otherwise a decent location too.",5,2013,02,18
211,Excellent,"Lovely people and excellent staff. Can not do enough for you. Brilliant hotel only ten euro taxi into temple bar. Twenty euro taxi from airport. Rooms well kept and cleaned daily. Well maintained building. Would defiantly recommend. 

Guinness factory a must cheaper online bookings. Hop on hop off bus is two euros cheaper if purchased in the hotel. Excellent way of seeing some of the sites and ticket lasts for two days.

Temple bar pub is expensive but other bar can be more reasonable. About six euros or cheaper for Guinness. Food is expensive as you want it to be.  Portions are massive.   ",5,2013,02,18
211,What a place !,"Took my wife to Dublin for her 40th birthday, and after much searching decided on the Croke park hotel, and certainly made the right choice !

Arrived at around 4pm in the pouring rain and were greeted with a warm welcome and  warm towels.

Check in took less than 5 minutes and had been upgraded into an executive room , which we found had been decorated for her birthday and a bottle of champagne waiting for us.

Room was really clean and had all the facilities you would expect. Executive lounge was a really nice touch as well.

Used the Restaurant the following night and meal and service were great, I even got ""told off"" for pouring my own wine ! ( in a friendly way! )

Some reviews seem to say this is quite far out from the City centre, Don't know if we just walk quickly or found a particularly short cut , but only took 10 minute walk to get into centre of city , which I would not consider a long way.

Could not recommend this hotel enough and if we ever go back to Dublin will definitely be going back here.",5,2013,02,18
211,Should have been nearer the city,"This was a great and very classy Hotel. From the moment you check in and given a nice warm flannel to the moment you leave, the staff were extremely courteous and helpful.

We booked an executive room (on the fourth floor) which enabled us to use the executive lounge which has large comfy sofas and chairs in front of a giant plasma screen and complimentary soft drinks (coffee machine, milk, juice and water).

Our room was delightful with a large queen size bed, fridge, free Wi-Fi and a view over Croke Park Stadium. The bathroom was large with a separate shower and great toiletries.

Evening food at the bar was great and my Apple Crumble dessert was a revelation. Breakfast followed in the same mode with great choice and great tastes so plenty to enjoy about the food at Croke Park.

The only problem for us was that the Hotel was a good distance away from the centre of Dublin and the No. 7 Bus was a ten minute hike from the hotel. Six days a week (Sunday to Friday), a courtesy bus picks up from the Hotel at 9:30 to take you to the Hop on Hop off Bus stop at the top of O'Connell Street (four pick up's on Saturday).

Brilliant Hotel, Fantastic Food and Great Service...even the car parking was free.",5,2013,02,17
211,Wonderful Experience,"We had an overall wonderful experience staying at the Croke Park Hotel.  It was our honeymoon and first time in Ireland.  Our flight arrived very early in the morning and we made it to the hotel around 8:30am.  The staff was very accommodating and allowed us to check in early.  We had to wait about 45 mins for a room to be ready, but we had access to the Executive Level lounge.  They sent us up to the lounge and when the room was ready, they delivered the keys to us there.  

The rooms were a little smaller that normally found in the US, but we stayed for 3 nights and we were completely comfortable.  The bathroom had a nice tub for soaking in.  We had breakfast in the Executive Lounge every morning.  Breakfast consisted of different breads and pastries, cereals, fruit and yogurt and assorted meats and cheeses as well as juice and coffee.  There was always bottled water available which was nice to have.  We ate in the bar area one night and had great fish and chips while my husband had a delicious cheeseburger.  The last night we were there, we ordered room service which was quick and hot.

This is a happening place on game nights...the hotel was quite quiet most of the time, but the last night we were there, was the opening night for GAA football.  The entire hotel was packed before, during and after the game. Even with the extra people in the hotel, our room was still quiet and we were not disturbed at all.    

We took cabs to City Centre and paid about 12 Euro each time.  We were told it was about a 20 minute walk, but we chose to take taxis as it was raining.   Overall, we had an amazing time and will definitely stay here again.  All of the staff was friendly, helpful and very accommodating.",5,2013,02,16
211,Excellent Hotel,"Stayed for a 3 night mid-week break, including dinner.  Dinner and breakfasts were excellent, bedroom/bathroom were clean and spacious, free wifi was very good.  The public areas and bar were very comfortable and the gym looked excellent, but I didn't try it.  The free parking was a boon and overall we had a really good experience.    There's a nice Italian restaurant 3 minutes' walk away and the range of shops, pubs and restaurants in Drumcondra are less than 5 minutes' stroll away.",4,2013,02,16
211,Wonderful,"Having used this hotel for members of staff, I was intrigued as to why they always wanted to stay here, and having travelled with them last week, I found out why. The hotel is to very high standard, as soon as you enter the door. Staff were very welcoming and friendly. Rooms very spotless, comfy bed and lovely bathroom with warm, powerful shower. Delightful lounge bar to relax with a drink late afternoon, and the restaurant in the evening, serves wonderful food. Breakfast was also very good.  Only one small complaint, my room was at the back of the hotel, and there seemed to be a fan going, which was a bit annoying, but would not hesitate to stay again and to recommend to others",5,2013,02,16
211,Thoroughly relaxing & enjoyable stay,"We booked via Secret escapes and were delighted with our stay. The staff were so friendly and helpful in every department and the room was beautiful. The bed was very comfortable and the room had every amenity one would want. The breakfast was delicious fresh and hot, the pastries seemed to be just out of the oven. The free car parking was an added bonus. There was a real buzz about the hotel& bar so it felt like a really warm, lively spot. We will definitely stay there again soon!",5,2013,02,15
211,A great Dublin Hotel,I have stayed in the Croke Park twice and loved the service and the location. The hotel staff is welcoming and eager to make your stay pleasant. Everyone at the hotel offered advice on how to get around in Dublin and when I lost my IPhone charger I was given one to use for my entire stay. Great people. My husband and I loved the ease of walking to all of Dublin from The Croke Park.  We enjoyed the ease of walking to the sights so that we really got to know the city. We never encountered any problems even walking back to the hotel late at night from the pubs.  Our room was spacious and very comfortable and the food in the restaurant was excellent. We will definitely return to the Croke Park Hotel on our next trip to Dublin.,4,2013,02,13
211,Five star service!,"The service in this hotel is what makes it stand out. From the welcome at the reception desk to the charming staff in the dining room and the cheerful bar staff every member of staff makes a huge effort and it really pays off and distinguishes this from other similarly priced hotels in Dublin. Location is fantastic right beside Croke Park, close to the city centre and very convenient place to stay for the Mater Hospital. Haven't had breakfast as had to leave very early but dinner was really good.
Rooms are quiet and very spacious and comfortable. There is a real feel good factor to this hotel and it is well worth a visit. An added bonus is the great value. A better hotel than many others charging twice the price.

211,"The best hotel i have ever stayed at, thank you Emer and Sarah","When I arrived at the reception at 11am, I was welcomed by the receptionist the ever smiling Emer, she is wonderful. Nothing is too much trouble for her.
I also met Sarah who deals with reservations, and she is fantastic, telling me to personally ask for her, when I come back (with my wife), and she will sort a great rate/offer for our stay
I was invited to the executive lounge while she sorted my room, 10 minutes later, she brought my suit case and room key for 414.
There is an upgrade you must not miss, for a small extra cost, you get upgraded to an executive  room. and full use of the executive lounge. It is on the fourth floor, continental breakfast food, available all day, coffee, tea, orange, milk etc, FOC.
They bring you a hot pillow and chocolates and the bed room is fantastic, slippers and dressing gowns in the room if that is your thing.
The staff are ALL fantastic, and really helpful, and the hotel food is outstanding quality
The is no charge for WIFI connection, and the speed of the internet is excellent.
It is next door to the Croke Park Stadium
The cost of a taxi into town, is 8 euros, and you must visit the Old Jameson distillery, great value
At the Airport there is the air-coach, which stops near the hotel, ( 8 minute walk) for 10 euros return, if you do not want a taxi ( expensive) from the airport. 
IF you ever go to Dublin, please consider this fantastic special hotel.",5,2013,02,12
211,An oasis of tranquility,"I booked a three- day stay at The Croke Park Hotel Dublin to celebrate my partner's 50th birthday through Secret Escapes and it did not disappoint!

Our first day did not start well.  We were ripped off by the airport taxi on our journey to the hotel. We reported this to the staff at the desk who offered us good advice about how to avoid this in the future - Be aware that it should not cost you 28 Euro to travel to the hotel from the airport. 18 Euro is a more realistic price!

We arrived well before our check in time of 2pm.  In fact it was 10.30am but this did not present a problem and the very helpful and friendly staff at reception provided us with entry to our fabulous Deluxe room ( with the most comfortsble bed ever!) which was located on floor 4, This also gave us access to the Executive Lounge where complimentary refreshments were on hand in addition to newspapers, television and radio - all in a very relaxing and comfortable environment. We were amazed at the level of luxury available to us for the very reasonable price of the stay.

This hotel is truly difficult to fault,  The staff are courteous and polite at all times.  Nothing is too much bother for them, Breakfast is excellent, although some staff can be a little slow at clearing tables sometimes!

The location however, does present a problem or two.  I would not recommend that you attempt walking back from town in the dark. It is only around a 15 minute walk but some points of the journey can be peppered with very scary and threatening- looking individuals ! Take the taxi back for your own safety and peace of mind. 

On balance, I would have no hesitation in coming back to The Croke Park Hotel.  It is simply one of the best hotels I have ever stayed in. The staff are delightful, the service is excellent and the hotel is clean and beautifully presented - even if the location is less than ideal.

Get yourself down there.  It is a proper little jewel and the perfect base to enjoy the delights of Dublin's fair city!",5,2013,02,11
211,A first rate hotel,"Croke Park is a modern hotel wiht first rate facilities.  The staff are friendly and efficient.  I thought that it provided exceptionally good value, particularly since a really excellent breakfast was included in the price.  (Most hotels in Dublin charge extra for breakfast.)  I liked the location - although it is some distance from the city centre, it only takes about 10 minutes to walk to O'Connell Street in the heart of Dublin.",5,2013,02,11
211,Fantastic 4 star and more,"First time in a Doyle collection hotel. Our stay was fantastic, we had a double superior room inc breakfast. The hotel Is located opposite their rugby grounds. The location is a 10 min walk to the centre of town. The location is very quiet after a busy day. Breakfast was substantial with a variety of hot and cold. Staff were friendly and very helpful. It's well worth every penny, so pls ls pls if you go to dublin for a stay CROKE PARK IS THE PLACE TO BE !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",5,2013,02,10
211,Highly recommended at a very good price,"We've stayed at this hotel for New Years for 2 years running and if we were going back to Dublin we would stay here again. 

Location - Little bit out the way, it's a 20 minute walk to town centre. There is a Green Bus that runs directly from the hotel which you can use to get around all the major tourists sites in Dublin. Taxi's from the airport to here are roughly €20 and to town was €10.

Food - Breakfast is very good. Everything you could want whether it's a full English breakfast or continental (including hams etc). Very good service, have as much as you want. We ate dinner here once, prices are similar to everywhere else in Dublin. It was a good meal but we recommend trying authentic Irish restaurants. 

Rooms - Very spacious, well kept. Maid service was very good and prompt. You get free tea and coffee + biscuits every day. There is also a safe in the room, free of charge. Free Wi-Fi in the room as well. 

Staff - Very friendly staff, always helpful, no complaints. The staff go the extra mile and are happy to book anything you want. Example, on departure, they offer you a complimentary bottle of water. 

Hotel - Nicely kept hotel. We were happy with both rooms we stayed in. The hotel lounge is a very good place to chill. The gym is available to use for guests, which is usually very quiet, and includes all standard equipment, even a fruit bowl + towels!",5,2013,02,09
211,Highly recommended,I have stayed here twice in recent times and both visits were terrific. From the moment you check in the service offered at the hotel are superb. The staff are friendly and so efficient offering you a hot towel to refresh yourself while you check-in. Every one of your needs are almost anticipated and catered for. The rooms are lovely and the beds are extremely comfortable. None of the rooms will give you a great view but you won't really care as all other aspects of the room and the hotel will compensate for this. The food in the bar and from the room-service menu was great with good value. I am usually a 'shop around' kind of person for a cheap hotel room but the Croke Park Hotel have definitely secured by loyalty and I will continue to stay here in the future.,5,2013,02,08
211,Comfort and peace,"Excellent staff make you feel welcome from the minute you check in. Well located , gives you a chance to walk into city and taxi back if you prefer. You are not far from the sea if you prefer that. A short drive away.",5,2013,02,08
211,Very well cared for,"What a friendly hotel to stay in. All the staff were helpful and friendly. the rooms were comfortable and I really like the ice machine! Ice in a G&T while I get ready to go out is a must. The breakfast was always good and the servers attentive without being intrusive. Stephen was our favorite as when he found out it was our wedding anniversary he had champagne sent to our room, what a lovely touch. 
My only negative comment is that it is not nearly as close to the city center as some of the booking sites suggest!",5,2013,02,07
211,"Great business traveller hotel, but not if you're a women","It really is a great hotel. The rooms are very large, there's loads of room to work on your laptop, the working area is designed for work and not for putting on makeup. My feeling was that they target business travellers because of their less than ideal location. It's not a family hotel, and it's not in a touristy location. Without Croke Park stadium across the road, the hotel would never have been built.

The price was good too - €72 mid-week.

About the location: it's a 10 minute walk from O'Connell street, but it's not the best part of town. A woman alone would probably not feel comfortable walking back to the hotel on a dark evening - or even during the day. But if you're a bloke, have a pair of shoulders, and don't mind stepping around the odd drunk, then you might find yourself liking this hotel and coming back again.",4,2013,02,06
211,AS GOOD AS REVIEWS,"I have to agree with all the TA reviews.  This is a great hotel outside the city center near Croke Stadium.  The free parking is worth at least another 15-20 euros.  The hotel and staff are faultless.  Tons of great restaurants in the area.  Highly recommended.

Tip.  We booked here last minute, 2 days before arriving in Dublin.  They ran a special for a superior room for two for only 35 euros.  Next time we're in Dublin, well book a cancelable reservation with the Croke Park, and check rooms the day before our stay to see if prices have come down.",5,2013,02,05
211,Nice Hotel,"We stayed at The Croke Park Hotel in December 2012.  The staff were very helpful and friendly, gave us advise on the best walking route into the city centre and about the Christmas market.
The room was very nice, lovely and warm - clean and tidy.  The bed was very comfortable and had a very good nights sleep.
The evening entertainment was one man on his guitar and wow what a great singer.
The breakfast was very good and hot, as sometimes the help yourself breakfast can be luke warm, but not here. On the whole 10/10.",5,2013,02,04
211,What a welcoming stay,"The rooms were very spacious and the standard was much higher than we expected, given the very reasonable price we paid. All the staff, without exception, were geared to making our stay as enjoyable as possible. We were upgraded on arrival and the concierge was on hand to answer a raft of questions and to helpfully direct us. We arrived early, yet they allowed us to get into our room and suggested we pop into the executive club to enjoy a continental style breakfast free of charge. The location, whilst not perfect, was only a 15 minute walk from Dublin centre and was close to the Dart station at Connelly street. Thank you to all the staff. Looking forward to our next trip",5,2013,02,04
211,Legendary Irish hospitality,"We popped over for a long weekend with the grandchildren and from the outside, when we arrived by taxi, it looked uninviting and drab. When we went in there was a great welcome. We had been upgraded to executive suite and the staff could not have made us more welcome. They were very welcoming and wanted to know all about us. It was more like visiting a friend than staying in an hotel. Inside the decor and quality was superb. I likened it to a Tardis, drab on the outside, but warm and inviting once you got in. Rooms were very spacious and well appointed. The bed was as comfortable as the Royal Chulan in Kualar Lumpar The location was opposite Croke Park stadium and we were able to take in a Gaelic football game during our stay. The location was about a 15 minute walk from the centre of Dublin, but the staff were always on hand to help and direct us and Connelly Station was only a short walk away which mad access to the Dart (train) very easy. The Irish breakfast was hearty and well cooked and set us up for the day. We ate there one evening and were not disappointed. We got a good deal on the price and the welcome, on arrival and during our stay made our short trip a memorable one. When we checked out the staff were very interested in our stay and satisfaction and even gave us a free bottle of water each for the journey. Can't wait to return",5,2013,02,04
211,Lovely rooms,"Stayed one night as attending a function in the Croke Park complex.lovely room,on my own but had a double and single bed in my room.staff v friendly.allowd me t leave my car in car park until matches finished on Sat evening.my only complaint was that at breakfast I waited over 20 mins for my twa and toast.would recomend a stay here.public areas are dpot
 snd very comfortable.",5,2013,02,03
211,First Class Hotel,"Lovely hotel, great service, clean rooms and excellent food. Great value all round. It may not have been located right in the centre but it made little difference. It was an easy walk into town and close to the local transport or approx 8 euros in a cab. Breakfast was excellent with a wide variety of options. We also ate there one evening which was lovely and good value. Would certainly recommend this hotel and would go back.",5,2013,02,01
211,Excellent stay at Croke Park Hotel,"After booking for a long weekend in Ireland, I saw the reviews of the Croke Park Hotel and the package deal (flight + hotel) on expedia.ca was just too good not to try it out. Very friendly staff, great concierge service, spotless spacious rooms (king size bed to boot!), good draught beer and food selection in the sideline bar, I understood why this place is ranked way up there as one of the top hotels in Dublin, even though being ""far"" from the city centre (but easily walkable though...and the cab ride back at night was roughly 10-12 Euros).

Although our stay was short (3 nights), I would definitively consider staying there again and would not hesitate to recommend this place.

Thank you for a great stay! :)",5,2013,01,30
211,The most fantastic team and hotel,"We stayed here for a girly weekend to celebrate my birthday and this place just did not disappoint!

I am not the type to gush about customer service but this place really left a lasting impression. I tend to find that going away as a single sex group we tend to be frowned upon but not here! We are well behaved though :)

On arrival at 11am we were given our keys with no fuss and I was willing to wait till check in times! They noted that our group was 6 girls and we had booked 2 triple rooms. I had read a review stating that a triple room was a double and single bed the day before so I was a little disapointed when when checking in they suggested moving us to a room with 3 beds (2 double and a single). What hotel does this without a fuss???!!!

When we didnt know how to working the heating system, someone came up immediately with a smile...no grumpy faces which I have often experienced. 

We had the lovely warm towels and went up to the rooms. They are clean and lovely and the bathroom huge and beautiful!

We ate in the bar that night and were really impressed with the food and the price was reasonable for hotel rates. I had the mushroom lasange which was delicious! We ate there again on our last day too as we enjoyed it so much.

When we asked where the shops were or the bars the staff would quickly pop out a map and circle the best areas and booked our taxis, all with the most genuine smiles! It made us feel so welcome and we couldnt stop talking about how impressed we were. Yes it is a walk from the hotel to town but for us personally as a group of 6 it made no odds to us getting taxis back and forth.

On returning to our rooms it was spotless and we had left everything all over the place! Fantastic cleaning staff! 

The team were so wonderful, and as a manager I would be very touched by how much they put into their jobs on a daily basis.

Thank you again we had the most fantastic time and definately will be back!",5,2013,01,29
211,Brilliant hotel,"Really clean rooms, spotless foyer and friendly staff, who were also knowledgeable about the local area. Huge selection at breakfast, and a massive kingsize bed. Not too far from city centre, maybe 15 mins walking max. Well worth every penny!",5,2013,01,27
211,What an Amazing Atmosphere,"I'm writing this review from my laptop using the FREE (no strings) WiFi in my room at the Croke Park Hotel.  I HAD to take time to say how amazing this hotel has been.  The atmosphere has been so welcoming and warm from the hot towel I was handed on check in, the food at the bar and the even the staff I have met while wandering through the corridor.  
The decor is clean and crisp without being sterile and for me, a very cold blooded person, the vital part is that the whole hotel is warm even in the large open plan areas of the hotel.  I cannot go further in this review without mentioning again, the staff.  As we sat and ate last night in a busy bar, our server David gave us not only prompt attention, but also took the time to converse with us and make us feel so very welcome.  This level of interpersonal interaction is something that stands out to me and I am sure many others and is what makes a stay away from home feel comfortable and inviting.  
All of the rooms are beautifully decorated but my only problem (which was solved instantly) is that I am allergic to feathers and when I approached reception to get alternative bedding, my request was met with an immediate response from Stephen at the front desk including what time would be suitable for the adjustment.  On my return to my room one of the housekeeping staff, Anita was waiting for me with the change of bedding, a warm smile and a genuine demeanor.
What I am really saying here is, the hotel as a building and somewhere to sleep is really lovely but the staff is really what is going to make your stay memorable.  I haven't even left yet and I already want to come back.",5,2013,01,26
211,excellent hotel,"Had a brilliant stay again in the Croke Park Hotel.  Was on top floor, and had access to the executive lounge, which was brilliant.  The front desk staff are very accommodating and helpful.  The room itself was perfect size and spotless.  Only fault was that at breakfast, I was seated at an unclean table, waited for ages, and still had to go and get cutlery etc myself.  The are itself is a bit suspicious, I certainly wouldn't walk by myself at night time.  Hotel overall though, top notch.",5,2013,01,25
211,Up for the match,Unbeatable location for staying when attending matches. Great atmosphere on match day. Good food but pricey. GAA personalities to be seen even when just dropping in for lunch. Location is not ideal for Dublin city visits unless you're up for a half hours walk to the city centre. ,4,2013,01,23
211,Croke Park Hotel,"I have stayed in The Croke Park Hotel on a number of occasions in the past few months. On each occasion the standard of service was excellent. The porter is always available to assist with luggage and to escort guests to their rooms. The reception staff are very efficient at both check in and check out and the warm towel presented to all checking in and the bottle of water on check out are very welcome touches. On my most recent visit I was asked if I would be happy to have the same room I had used on my previous visit, which I thought was a nice touch too!
The rooms are very comfortable, with both a double and a single bed, as well as separate bath and shower in the bathroom. Tea and coffee making facilities are available along with a mini bar, ice bucket, glasses etc.
I have eaten in the restaurant, in the bar and from the room service menu. I have always been very pleased with the food served in the hotel and would recommend the food to all guests. Breakfast is very tasty too and if something you require is not available on the buffet, the helpful staff will get it for you very quickly. 
I have already booked my next stay in this hotel and I'm looking forward to it!",5,2013,01,23
211,Quality hotel,"This is a great hotel with comfortable, spacious rooms and plenty to occupy yourself on site if you don't want to go downtown Dublin. It's a good location with good public transport links nearby,
The staff are attentive and for pleasure or business I enjoy this hotel.",4,2013,01,22
211,Great place to stay in Dublin!,"We arrived several hours early and they gave us our room no problem. They have a taxi service they contact which is reputable, this way it is safe, less likely to be ripped off. It took less than five minutes every time we requested a cab.
 We had a few questions as to where to go, which tours were good and which areas of Ireland were worth seeing, we were in town for a limited amount of time. Emer the desk attendant was extremely helpful, providing information that she knew as well as researched to be up to date. She took a good amount of time to help us as we'll as the concierge. No matter what time of day there was someone available to help us and answer questions. Staff was very friendly and knowledgable. 
The rooms were nice, plenty of room, up to date bathrooms. Very clean. Bathrooms had a shower as well as a separate bathtub. Several lights in the room, nice and bright if you need.
A few things to keep in mind:
This hotel is not within walking distance and is about a 10 euro ride,one way, away from downtown and is not within walking distance. There is also a bus station to use which is about 2euro a person.
There is nothing to eat close so you will either have to take a taxi or do delivery. There were a bunch of delivery places, all different types. They also have a bar/restaurant downstairs which has a full menu. Bar open late.
They have power adapters to borrow, just in case you forget yours,10 euro deposit to use and they refund you once you return it.",5,2013,01,21
211,Great hotel - NYE trip,"We stayed at this hotel for 3 nights from 29 Dec 2012 to 1st Jan 2013.

The hotel was excellent, the room was superb, the food was spot on... 5* all around. Buffet breakfast had everything you needed, and the food in the restaurant was great. The staff were friendly and helpful.

The only downside to this hotel is that it is a good 15 minute walk into the city centre (about 25 mins walk to Temple Bar). The hotel is literally outside Croke Park Stadium so it is perfect for that. The area around the hotel is a bit run down but not as bad as other people have made out on these reviews.

We were really impressed with the hotel, we got a great deal, and would stay here again.",5,2013,01,20
211,Excellent weekend stay,"We got the wow feeling right from the beginning. We were upgraded upon arrival and given a room on the fourth floor. Staff were exceptionally welcoming and informative in both dining room and reception.  We were offered a cocktail as part of the package and enjoyed a beautiful mojito before our three course meal. The food was beautifully presented and extremely tasty and served with panache! We even had to take a sneaky minute during the meal to send a text to our daughter saying that the experience in the Croke Park Hotel was 'wow' so far.

We cannot wait to return.",5,2013,01,20
211,Wonderful modern hotel -great value - close to downtown,"Excellent hotel and amazing service and staff.  The hotel was very modern and the rooms were extremely confortable and spacious.  When they learned that it was our aniversary there was a wonderful surprise waiting when we arrived (chapagne).  It is a very short commute to downtown by bus, taxi or driving and could even be walked.  We were driving across Ireland and spending a few days in Dublin and it was great that parking was included here.  The rates were incredible value - I would have expected a hotel of this quality to be at least double what their advertised rate was - we booked directly with the hotel.  Would highly recommend for stays in Dublin.",5,2013,01,19
211,"First-class, modern, beautiful hotel","We chose this hotel for our two-night stay in Dublin after researching many other city hotels. We wanted something convenient to the airport, but it was so much more. Everything about the hotel was first-class, from the room décor and amenities to the clean, modern design to the 24-hour lounge with complimentary beverages and snacks. The buffet breakfast was extensive and delicious; staff were accommodating and friendly; and rooms were comfortable, quiet, and highly secure. The hotel is close to a bus route into the city center (not more than a 10-min walk to the bus stop and less than 10 mins more to downtown) and is a short taxi or bus ride to the airport. We were impressed and would definitely stay here again! Loved it!",5,2013,01,16
211,Trip to Dublin,"Excellent hotel, staff very friendly and helpful, great food, very clean and secure property. Got very good price on Hotels.com January sale. Look forward to staying at this hotel again.  Convenient for the city centre, O2, or of course Croke Park.",5,2013,01,13
211,Superb - First Class :)),"We stayed here on 17.12.2012 for my 50th birthday... This was a Travelzoo Offer so we expected just basic accommodation and service !! From start to finish this was 5* all the way ....
Accommodation upgrade was a bonusv-executive floor and lounge
 Are very well appointed. 24\7 gourmet tea & coffee a nice bonus .. Fresh fruit and unlimited bottled mineral water great :))
Restaurant was exemplary and service superb !!
Breakfast is a buffet affair .. All other usuasl you would expect .. Only complaint was that nothing was really hot enough ...

Would recommend this hotel to all ... As a matter of interest this is within 10-15 minutes walk of Dublin city centre - same from connolly street station 

Enjoy the Craic :))",5,2013,01,13
211,"Fantastic hotel, slightly out...","Hotel itself was great - as you would expect for a 4 star. Service was great, staff v friendly and they let us check in much earlier which was great,
The location we found a little bit out of Dublin central - whilst there is a bus  that leaves every 15 mins or so to Grafton Street, coming back because of the one ways it drops you far from hotel and you have to walk 12-15 mins more.
We did walk alot but if you cant manage, or have kids etc you may have to get a taxi to hotel.

Staff were very kind to allow us to use the gym at any time of the day, however we were disappointed that there was no swimming pool or spa. Being so far out from centre you would expect that at least",4,2013,01,13
211,Good place to rest,"I loved this hotel, it was a wonderful place to be. Food in the Sideline Bar was excellent as I had a meal in there every night of my stay. Breakfast in the Executive Suite was excellent and I would definitely go again. Although the area was a bit run down, I felt safe and a excellent bus route into the centre of town.",5,2013,01,12
211,First stay in the city - Not disappointed,"In a word.... WOW.... The rooms were amazing. The bed was the most comfortable thing I have ever slept in (other than my own bed). The bathroom and shower were lovely too. Breakfast was a fantastic selection of cereal, fruit, yoghurt, croissants and hot food. 
The hotel is literally in the shadows of Croke Park Stadium and is a good 15 minute walk into town but easily do-able (even after a few pints of the black stuff!). We felt quite safe walking to and from the hotel into town but it is slightly run down.
Would visit again",5,2013,01,11
211,excellent,"Stayed in this hotel on 2 separate occasions and was impressed by the quality of the hotel and the staff there
The rooms are spotless and the food is very good for a hotel .A lot of hotels i have stayed in  do not have good restaurants  
It is maybe a bit out of the way for some people but there is no shortage of taxis around .This did not concern me as i came by car which is kept in a secure underground car park 
This is one place I could recommend to anyone",5,2013,01,10
211,Fantastic Hotel,"This was my second stay at the Croke Park Hotel and it did not disappoint.  The check in staff are definitely the friendliest and efficient I have ever come across. The superior bedroom was clean and spacious though smaller than our previous stay in an executive room. The ensuite was a good size and very clean. 
We stayed on a Travelzoo package and had dinner on one evening, this deal offered a small menu but it was absolutely delicious with excellent staff again. We were not offered a wine list which was a missed sales opportunity however this is not a fault. The main menu looked great though we didn't try it the second night as we were going into Dublin centre. Breakfast was extremely busy but the choice and quality of food was excellent. 
Check out was again fast and efficient. A real bonus to this hotel is the free car parking. 
The hotel is a ten minute walk from the centre of Dublin, we walked during the day but got a taxi at night which was about E10 each way. If you don't mind a walk to the centre this hotel is excellent. We will definitely return to this hotel.",5,2013,01,10
211,"Great hotel, poor location","We got a good deal for the price of the hotel, breakfast included, and were pleasantly surprised to find it didn't take us more than 15 minutes from T1 airport, by bus. 

That said, the area is absolutely awful if you're walking, we got a bit lost and there was no one we could ask for directions. We ended up finding the hotel and, as pictured on their website, it's a lovely place. Probably ideal if you're by car or you're always going to take a taxi. It surely is more of a hotel business, where you really don't need to walk anywhere.

As for the room itself: we got an executive suite and it was great, spacious, well furnished and with an ample desk, table and lounge sofa. The bathroom was also big, with tub and shower separated. Everything you could need for, except for one simple thing: the fridge wasn't a fridge, but a minibar! You couldn't store any food in it, which would have been nice to not throw our delivery dinner in the first night we were there, since we arrived really late and they didn't have food available anymore.

The staff was very polite, although they seemed a bit overloaded with work, maybe there were just moments but they couldn't handle everything at the same time.

The breakfast was INCREDIBLE, both the continental and the full irish. I recommend to try both! The lounge where the continental breakfast is served is really nice also.

We also ate at the restaurant one night, and the food was really good, both the steak and the caesar salad, very fresh products.

All in all it's a very good hotel, but keep in mind the location thing, is not near the main attractions, and to catch the hop on-off bus, you have to walk a lot (unless you catch it from the hotel's door, but that option is not available every day).",4,2013,01,10
211,Great Stay,"Booked this for our anniversay get away & loved it!

Rooms were lovely, clean and quiet!  Stayed in the executive rooms and the turn down service at night is a lovely bonus.

Food in the restaurant the first night was very good & we had fantastic steaks in the bar the second night.

We walked to the city centre and on the way there it didnt seem too bad as we were taking in the sights but the walk back seemed very long as we were tired & hungry.  But only a twenty minute walk at a nice pace so good for burning off the extra calories we comsumed while staying there.",4,2013,01,09
211,Highly Recommend,"What a nice clean hotel! I was only supposed to stay two nights, but couldn't get on a stand-by flight out and had to return for a third night. Many hotels take advantage of customers in emergency situations, but management here went out of their way to accommodate me, and make my extra day in Dublin most comfortable. The breakfasts are something to look forward to, as well.",5,2013,01,08
211,"Lots of very nice touches; just one small glitch (two, actually) to fix, please.","Lots and lots of great things about this place, beginning with the always helpful and friendly staff.

I got an email from some travel site or other offering a pretty good deal on room plus full breakfast so decided to check the place out for a few nights on my way from Vienna to USA.  The experience was great, beginning with the hot towel I was given to clean up when checking in (and the 15 euro ride in from the airport didn't hurt much, either). Then on my way back through Dublin on return I decided to book Croke Park for another night, knowing how reliable it is.

The room was very nice, excellent bathroom with large, clean tub and separate shower, lots of counter space and room to maneuver, even if two are using the bathroom at once.  Quite nice these days where even four-star places are eliminating tubs to save on water usage. 

Also nice for a European hotel is that there are plenty of lights in the room and actually adequate electrical outlets--one of the first times I have not had to unplug some lamp or other to find a place to plug in a computer.

The king bed was extremely comfortable, with plenty of pillows. Overall the room was quite spacious and a relaxing place to unwind.

Breakfast also excellent--full (very full) Irish breakfast elegantly spread out in a buffet with extremely polite and attentive servers bringing hot drinks and toast on request and clearing quickly.  A comp newspaper made me want to linger even longer.

My two little suggestions:  

1.  The hotel requires a key card to get the elevator to operate, which is fine. But if you have a visitor you can't call to have them given access, which has always worked in every other hotel I've seen use this method of security. Instead you have to go down to meet your visitor.  Most places either have a staff member go activate the elevator or are able to give guests of guests cards that work in the elevator only. Ironically, the stairs are not secure, and people can just walk up that way.

2.  The other little issue is that food service quits quite early (9:30 PM) and there's only one restaurant of any sort anywhere nearby ( a nice Italian place about a block away).  So there's absolutely no way to get anything to eat (not even any convenience stores nearby) after that time. I found this out the hard way when I unkowingly went to order a sandwich in the bar at 9:35.  The server at least checked with the chef, who said nope.  In my experience working in nicer hotels years ago, in this situation everyone should have agreed--the chef and the server and the hotel make a little more money and the guest is left with a quite nice impression.

Location is not excellent, with nothing of interest nearby unless you're there to go to the stadium.  But the center of town is just a 20-minute walk which I found quite pleasant in the daytime, but wouldn't want to attempt at night, when the neighborhood is mostly deserted and a little spooky-looking. 

Oh, and one more suggestion--having a 24-hour cancellation window can be problematic.  I was flying from the US and had a severely delayed flight, which if it had been a cancellation would have meant I lost a day of travel. So I didn't reserve online and instead called the hotel, where the receptionist recommended I just call when I actually arrived in Dublin, as bookings were quite thin for that night.  I appreciated this information but this hotel (and all hotels) should be more flexible when they are trying to serve tourists who are at the mercy of airlines that are getting sloppier and sloppier in their performances.

But the best compliment I have has to do with what happened after I left my i-pad in the room.  I realized in while at the airport, and called the hotel, who sent someone to check on it while I held the line.  They found it and promised to put it in the safe for me to pick up when I came back through Dublin. Over the years I have probably left things in hotel rooms of enough value for me to try to track them down at least a dozen times, and this was the first and only time the hotel employees have managed to find what I had left behind. When I came back through, they had my i-pad in an envelope in the safe waiting for me, and in fact insisted on delivering it to my room rather than have me wait for a manager to open the safe.  Nice job, Croke Park!",5,2013,01,06
211,Nice Hotel,"Staying for a few days, first visit to this hotel. The taxi driver gave us quick bearings and directions to city centre. It is a ways from everything but I like being off the beaten path. The food in the bistro was excellent and the staff friendly. We stayed on the fourth floor with the executive club down the hall. That was a nice touch. This is not your place if you want to be smack in the middle of the hustle of tourist central. A quiet, relaxing stay.",4,2013,01,04
211,Great Stay,Have just returned from my New Year break in Dublin. Stayed at the Croke Park Hotel.From arrival to leaving this hotel and staff(Alva Gail John Pauline etc!) were fantastic .Great room-good food-perfect location for everything you want to do-all within reach .Pubs eating places even the zoo was handy-highly recommend this hotel!,5,2013,01,04
211,"Great hotel, but location is 15-20 min walk away from everything","Hotel is great, modern furnishings and large bathroom with both a tub and a shower. Staff is helpful, the service is good. 

Location is the only drawback. It is a 15-20 min walk to the centre. A taxi will take about 5-10 min, and cost 8-12 euros. 
It is located close to the Croke Park stadium. 
Few shops, pubs or restaurants in the nearby area.",4,2013,01,03
211,"Great hotel, friendly staff","We got a great deal to stay at the Croke Park Hotel in Dublin for New Year.  We cannot fault this hotel at all, the staff were helpful and friendly, the room was lovely and clean.  The food was excellent.  It was a 15 minute walk to the city centre, 20 minutes to Temple Bar and approximately 40 minutes to the Guinness Storehouse for the tour, which is worth the 16 euro's entry.  The buses are cheap and you can get the number 16 or 41a from the airport for 2 euro's 50 cents and the same back.  Look for deals on the internet for really good deals that include the hotel and tickets for the Guinness tour.  Highly recommended!!  Photo's to follow.",5,2013,01,03
211,Good,"Our flight arrived in Dublin at 7:30am and we was in our room by 8:30am for a much needed sleep before hitting Dublin City. Wasn't expecting to be able to check in so early but are eternally grateful for that. The rooms were spacious and very clean. Hotel staff were very friendly also. The location wasn't too bad took approx 15-20 mins to walk to the centre of Dublin. The only downside I can give is the food in the bar, the food was bland and was quite obviously not cooked from scratch I had the fish & chips and it was soggy and was like something would buy from Tesco freezer section not what I'd expect for near on €16 my partner also said the burger was quite tasteless. Didn't eat in the Bistro so can't comment on that. Overall good stay and would def stay again. ",4,2013,01,02
211,Fabulous and personal,"OMG! What a fabulous hotel!!
The attention to each guest is extraordinary.
I went last summer with my elderly father and had e mailed ahead, asking for an early checkin.
I did not expect to be greeted as I was, served tea and scones and when the rooms were ready, they were upgraded and beautiful. i felt like I was special and every time I went to reception, I felt like they knew me personally.
True genuine dublin warmth, without asking.
When we left they even offered water to take on our journey. I will be back....",5,2013,01,01
211,Excellent Standard Hotel,"Stayed at this hotel for a conference at Croke Park, which in terms of location could not be better, as it is directly over the road from the venue. The rooms are spacious and well desinged, with everything you could need for a business stay.

The room rate are very good value compared to other hotels where i have paid far more for far less in terms of quality and service.",5,2012,12,29
211,"Nice hotel, bad location","As many other reviewers have said, this hotel is very nice but the location is way off the beaten path.  Getting to Temple Bar took 20 minutes through a mostly run down part of town and while we never felt it was dangerous, it wasn't a pleasant stroll and I wouldn't walk in the area late at night.  We ended up taking a taxi back at night, which cost about 8-10 euros, depending on the starting point.  That said, the hotel staff was wonderful, our room had a beautiful bathroom, comfortable bed and pillows, and all the amenities one could possibly ask for, including a pants press and an ipod dock.  The food in the bistro was very good.  I enjoyed watching the kitchen staff prepare the meals.  Added bonus:  free parking underneath the hotel.  Because it is on the outskirts of town, getting to the hotel and the airport couldn't have been easier.",4,2012,12,29
211,"Very Nice Hotel, a little on the expencive side but very very nice.","Stayed here with my Girlfriend in December as was attending a concert in the city the following day so decided to make a weekend of it and do a bit of shopping also.  The hotel was easily found, with its proximity to the main stadium. The outward appearance of the hotel was clean modern and quite appealing.  Inside, the Hotel has a very modern yet warm look, very spacious in its arrangement in all areas so even with crowd you dont feel under pressure.
 
Room was excellent, very very clean, very well finished and very well furnished. Beds were soft are very luxiousous and pillows proived were of varying firmness from the very soft to quite firm depending on your own prefrence.  The room was very warm with an excellent environmental control on the wall which provided tempratures from 16-26 degrees, but the overall temprature of the hotel means that you have very little need to boost the heat in the rooms. The bathroom was also very spacious despite having a seperate show and bath provided, both were very clean the the water temprature and pressure was excellent.
 
Bar area again had a very modern but still very warm feeling to it, a open plan type Gas fire more for decoration that heat value and a large screen provided a very nice atmosphere. Tables were all weighted on, which ment that i never had to go to the bar, which was nice, albeit making me lazy!. Food was very good, but i would say a little of hte pricy side for main courses although sandwiches and paninis were priced on the higher side of average.  The portions were quite good, but without sounding critical for the price they certainly would need to be.
 
The area around the hotel, despite Croke Part itself is not particularly nice, you are very close to Dorset Street and there are a few other pubs around, but on a whole you would not be really that eager to leave the hotel and walk to the town centre particularly on a quiet nite. Best thing to do would be to make directly for Dorset street through one of the residential areas and if it was late,  i would not advise walking alone.
 
Breakfast was delicious with a massive arrange of hot and cold foods, it was very very busy, but that was down to our own timing (30 mins before end of breakfast) as much as anything else, that said we were queueing for only about 5-10 mins and while we where were queueing,  staff were encouraging us to have a glass of juice/ tea or coffee and a mini danish.  Again a very nice touch.  Staff were a little over stretched during the ""rush period"" i thought and one more person waiting tables or bringing out tost and tea and coffee would of made a huge difference but the rush was over quite quickly and the room emptied rapidly.
 
Staff were very polite from Check in to Check out, and it was perhaps the most ""Friendly"" reception ive had in a hotel, the hot towels on arrival and the complimentary bottled water at check out is a nice touch, but maybe a flirting a bit on the side of overkill.
 
Cant fault the hotel really, a very nice and most of all comfortable stay, probably as luxiourious a hotel as ive stayed in. A Little bit pricy is certain areas, but is i suppose a hotel of its type and in Dublin, it was to be expected.  While i got great value for the cost of staying, cost of eating and drinking were easily 10-15% higher than other hotels, that would be the only thing that would stop me staying again. Then again taking into account how comfortable the hotel was, id almost overlook it.",4,2012,12,21
211,Good hotel great food,"We stayed 3 nights on a short break, can't remember what we paid but it wasn't expensive, or we wouldn't have chosen it.
Room was good, good shower/toilet, staff were some of the best I've come across, reception, waiting, and concierge.. We didn't get to try the breakfast, but we did eat there 3 times and the food was very good, again at a reasonable price.
not sure when/if we'll be going to Dublin again, but if we do I'll certainly be looking at this hotel - if the same combination of price/quality holds up, it's hard to beat.
Only downside - It's not central, but it's only a short cab ride or a walk of maybe 15 mins to the centre.",4,2012,12,19
211,I will be back,The room was very nice and modern. They had great tea and coffee factiles and the shower was really relaxing. There was also sky sports on the tv in our room and a hi-fi radio where you could play your mp3 player. The hotel was well built and well mentained and very clean. The staff were very friendly and helpful. I will be back again.,5,2012,12,17
211,My New Dublin Hotel of Choice,"We booked this hotel on a great deal with a comparison website and might not have chosen it before that because there are so many hotels in Dublin so there is so much choice. I'm glad I got the opportunity to stay in the hotel because it lived up to my many expectations of hotels. I stay in a lot of hotels so I know what I like. 

The hotel offers free parking and free internet access along with the choice of a 4th floor executive floor stay which has an executive lounge offering complimentary drinks and snacks and someplace to relax. There is the use of a meeting room also. 

We booked for a birthday visit to the city and there were balloons and a happy birthday sash on the wall which was a nice little extra. They had given me the wrong room and within minutes apologised and upgraded us to the Liam McCarthy Suite on the 4th floor which has the exact same bedroom area with the addition of a living room/dining room, 2nd TV, iPhone dock(up to 4s) and Nespresso machine(in all 4th floor rooms). 

We arrived at 11am and stored the car in the underground car park and headed off to Dublin City Centre to do some Christmas shopping. Dublin city is expensive for parking so getting free parking with a 15minute walk is a good choice because parking can be around €12 per day otherwise. It is important to note that I wouldn't walk the same route in the dark. 

We had breakfast and it was standard hotel affair. I commented that the price comparison website offered me a ""Full English breakfast"" and this was ""Irish"". I don't think the girl got the joke. 

If I am coming back to Dublin I will choose this hotel. If you are going to Croke Park then you cannot get a better location. If you are visiting even the Mater hospital then chose this hotel. 10 minute walk.",4,2012,12,17
211,"Very modern, if you don't mind the walk to town or paying the price","We picked this hotel based on a package and we were glad it included breakfast. The hotel is pretty close to Dublin airport and we paid 26 euros to get to it. Once we checked in, the concierge offered us to upgrade a suite and be able to check immediately... for a fee, so we declined. She said there were no rooms available so we would have to wait until the regular check in time at 3. We were not able to get to breakfast either since we were not checked in. They did offer to hold our luggage on the mean time though. 

I noticed the had a shuttle that take you to O'Connell street every hour. We signed up for it and the concierge told us we had to pay 2 euro each to take us there. If you go on a car or taxi, it is about 5 minutes, walking about 20 minutes or so. We came back later on the day and were able to finally check in. Yay! One perk was free Wi Fi in the lobby and in your room.

The room was pretty good size, we had 2 double beds, a small table with a chair, a flat screen TV, a roomy closet and the bathroom has a separate shower and a tub. The bed was very comfortable and the area is very quiet. There were no games on the stadium so we got a very good night sleep.

For one tour, we had to leave at 6:20 am to catch the bus, the concierge put together 2 small bags with our breakfast: cookies, muffins, yogurt, fruit and a small water since we were going to miss the breakfast. We had to ask though for it.

When we had breakfast, it was traditional Irish breakfast with eggs, sausage, tomatoes, mushrooms, potatoes, pastries, cereal, yogurt and juice served in a buffet. 

If you decide to take a cab to town is about 10 euros each way.

We did walk at night coming back to the hotel and the area is residential, so it was pretty quiet. The downside is that there are no stores such as Tesco really close by, you need to walk 10-15 minutes. So when we went to town, we will buy water and snacks to bring them back.",4,2012,12,16
211,Nice stay,"My recent trip to Dublin had me staying at this hotel. I was very surprised at what a nice hotel it was. The staff was extremely friendly and the breakfast was delicious. The hotel has all the modern amenities needed. The lounge with fireplace is very inviting. Although, not directly in the city center it is a quick taxi or about a 20 min walk. I walked with friends and found it to be a nice walk. The beds were super comfortable.",5,2012,12,16
211,"Great service, and great location","I was there for only 5 nights, a family emergency took me away. Close to downtown Dublin, airport, and directly across from THE Croke park.  Pascale food and bev,, Robert ,concierge and i believe Lara ""The Galway Girl"" in the lounge provided awesome service.If i got any names wrong...you know who you are, iam huge on service and this hotel was great. Great wifi, decent workout area, nice beds, and no nee to feel unsafe here. Just cross the canal, and there is Dublin, 15 min. walk. Thank you Croke park ...oh Sandeep in the executive lounge was a joy to chat with...",5,2012,12,16
211,"Nice hotel, location a bit iffy","Stayed here on business. The hotel is in good condition and well maintained. Nice little library area with a gas fire. The bar is spacious and offers good service. Reception was efficient and polite.

The room was a good size, with a nice tv with sufficient channels and free wifi. The bed was large and comfy with pillows of differing firmness. Good heating too and comfy seating with a separate table. Walls are quite thin though and door banging could be an issue at busy times.

A good size safe was also provided.

The nice, well proportioned bathroom had a bath and separate shower with nice toiletries. The towels were ok but not as luxurious as one might expect.

The location is in walking distance of city centre but the area is quite deprived. Would not recommend walking around at night.

Nice hotel, good services but unless you are here for the GAA stadium, I would choose elsewhere south of the river.",4,2012,12,14
211,Top Marks for Croke Park,"Myself,wife & little boy stayed in the Croke park recently for 3 nights,it was our 2nd stay in this hotel, staff are very friendly,attentative and easy to deal with.The Croke park is a very comfortable,plush hotel.
Plus points: Free underground parking(good for central dublin)
                   Modern rooms with particularly comfy beds
                   Flat screen Tv which includes Sky sports (that's fairly uncommon !)
                   Great selection at Breakfast,hot & cold
                   Lovely bar with huge screen,very handy for matches
I've yet to encounter any minus points in my 2 stays at the croke park,would have no hesitation in staying for a week or so here !",5,2012,12,14
211,Ideal for north city business trip,"I stayed at the Croke Park hotel in early December.  Location was perfect as I was meeting people for dinner in the city centre but had meetings the next morning in North Dublin.  

The accommodation was of a very good standard.  One of the comfiest beds I have ever slept in, nice quality bedding, room not too hot.  Bathroom had a full bath and seperate double sized walk in shower.  Everything was very clean, new and modern.  Staff at reception very friendly and helpful (able to provide me with a spare toothbrush whe I realised I had forgotton to pack mine!).  

Breakfast the next morning was a bit of a letdown - selection of food a bit bland and uninteresting.  Took ages to get the attention of someone to ask for coffee and toast (lots of eye avoiding going on among staff), which was a real pain as I didn't have a lot of time to linger before leaving for work.  Toast was pale and soggy and coffee was just brown flavoured water.  

I paid 96 euro for B&B, which is excellent value for a hotel of this standard in Dublin.  I'm sure I will return.  Next time though I will just go for room only and get breakfast somewhere else.",4,2012,12,14
211,First Trip to Ireland,"We stayed 6 nights, 3 girls far from home.  We had the friendliest receptionist and concierge that helped us and gave us excellent advise on where to go or what to do.  The Hotel is 10-15 minute walk from the main street, but we loved it.  The morning walk in to town and the evening walk back.  We did not have any issues at all.  I defenitly plan on making it back in the future.  Rooms were always clean, tho they do make their rounds late.  We came back around 3 to change and relax before heading out and they were just getting to our room.  But we enjoyed the music and atmosphere in the lounge.",4,2012,12,13
211,"Excellent hotel, not so great  location.","We spent two nights here in November, and on the whole had a wonderful stay. An initial mix up with the room upon check in was quickly remedied. The room was extremely spacious and certainly  luxurious, as indeed was the hotel generally. The hotel staff were courteous, friendly and helpful, although as has been mentioned in other reviews, the table service in the bistro could certainly have been better, however  the food was excellent.
 The buffet breakfast was also  without doubt one of  the best I have experienced .
With regard to the location, it was not so much the distance from the city centre (only20 mins walk , no problem), but the hotel is located right between a railway line and canal , and Croke Park Stadium, (which even a couple  of the hotel staff referred to as a bit of a concrete monstrosity). That was no problem for us whatsoever, but something anyone contemplating a visit may wish to consider
All in all, we still had a thoroughly enjoyable stay, and would certainly visit again, and would have no hesitation in recommending to others.",4,2012,12,12
211,A Warm Friendly Hotel,"We stayed for a weekend on a special offer break via Travelzoo, the staff were very attentive  and friendly and they could not do enough for you. Our deluxe room was spacious and clean, we opted for the 'turn down' service with a 'hottie' in the bed which the 1st night was ok as it was left during the evening but the 2nd night they knocked on our door at 5.30pm, we are not young but even that was a bit too early, so we did ask them to come back later in the evening while we were out. The buffet breakfasts were good and the food was fresh. There was entertainment each night in the bar which was nice to come and have a drink and relax after a busy day/evening. The hotel offered a shuttle bus to the Christmas Market, which was 2 euros each way, I would not bother going as there were only about a dozen stalls, we were there 7/9th December so maybe there will more stalls to follow as nearer to Christmas?",4,2012,12,12
211,Average,"We stayed for a weekend in a deluxe room.  It was quite small, but bathroom was immaculate.  We had a turn down service, which was a nice touch.  Unfortunately our dining experience in the sideline bistro was not so great.  The food was okay and table service was poor.  When I asked for a clean glass to use with red wine this was received with a grunt.  The breakfast was good.  I don't think I would recommend this hotel to my friends or family.",3,2012,12,11
211,Excellent hotel just bit to far from city centre.,"Excellent hotel rooms are terrific breakfast are one of the best self service,
Meals are good just pity we where on a fixed menu with our deal but still good.
Only down side is taxi in and out of city centre  adds up if you like to socialize better to stay closer to city centre other than that it excellent hotel.",4,2012,12,11
211,4th Time - as good as ever,"Two nights weekend room only originally planned at the listed web price, but contacted the hotel to explain this was our 4th stay - the personal touch did not disappoint! 

Without giving the game away we ended up with a room upgrade and breakfast each morning for an incredible price. 

The personal touch didn't end there with a complimentry drink offered to us on arrival.

This is the sort of thing that is missing from most other big name hotels these days - a service making you feel like you're an individual and that your custom is actually valued.

As for the hotel itself - one year on from our last visit nothing has changed. Rooms in good condition and spotlessly clean, beds as comfy as ever, everything working as it should be. Web access free, easy and fast. But most importantly staff are very pleasant, socialable and cheery. Assistance never appears to be a problem to them. It does make a difference and enhances your stay.

If you can live with the slight hinderance of 10 euro taxis in/out of city centre, or like us are prepared to walk in and out without any reservations - (we believe your more likely to get mugged in the busy city centre attractions than the empty streets around Croker) - then this is a hotel that will continually hit all the right buttons

Looking forward to next years weekend away already!",5,2012,12,10
211,This hotel never disappoints,"Stayed at the Croke Park Hotel recently for two nights B&B. This is our third time to stay at this hotel and it was as good as ever.  The rooms are lovely, really clean and well maintained, and a comfy bed. The bathrooms are fabulous also - roomy and spotless. Ate in the bar too and it was fine, as was breakfast.The staff are very caring and polite without being too over the top. Overall a very satisfying experience. It's brilliant to see top standards being maintained by the Doyle group in this tough economic climate.",5,2012,12,08
211,Fantastic Hotel,"I was in Dublin for a family wedding.... We had a party of 14 and the hotel did everything they could to help us.... It was my first time in Dublin so i didn't know where anything was, but the reception team soon had everything i needed to get me to the wedding, including maps and safety pins for the grooms suits... The rooms are comfortable with everything you would need for a comfortable stay... The hotel serves great food and the breakfast is everything you could need to start the day off.... Only 10 mins from the main shopping area.... Will definitely be returning sometime very soon.",5,2012,12,07
211,Hard to find better!,First time to stay in Dublin in a number of years.The hotel was recommended by family and we got a great 2 night deal with Travelzoo. Check in was prompt and the receptionist very friendly and helpful. We got a free upgrade to a de luxe room with access to the Executive lounge.The bed room was so comfortable and after a days sightseeing it was lovely to just sit back and relax in the Executive lounge with coffee & cookies and read the papers. Breakfast had all the usual choices including the good old Irish fry - the black pudding and sausages were to die for. On the 2nd morning we had a continental breakfast in the Executive lounge which was lovely. Here we got speaking to the member of staff on duty - Stephen. What a great ambassador for the hotel. With free parking and a 10/15 minute walk to O'Connell Street this hotel really is ideal. We really could not have wished for better. Will definitely return.,5,2012,12,06
211,Great hotel,"This hotel is about 10 mins drive away from the city centre where all main shopping, pubs, Guinness storehouse etc is. It's about €10 for the taxi which is great. The service is great, really friendly staff and the rooms are very clean and tidy. The breakfast that is included is pretty standard, crossiants, rolls, spreads, cheeses, fruits and coffees. The restaurant inside the hotel has some great food but a little pricey is you are on a budget tour. (About 20-25€ for a main). 
I recommend this hotel! It's perfect for a short trip to Ireland!   ",5,2012,12,05
211,A weekend in Dublin,"The deal was good, the hotel was very clean and comfortable, about 15 minutes fwalk from the centre, but therefore not so noisy. Food was very good and staff could not do enough. Six of us had a very pleasant weekend.",4,2012,12,04
211,"not nice, very nice !","Dublin does not enjoy best european weather but for once this is a good reason to stay indoor and enjoy your room and the lobby. 
the Croke Park is a really nice place. the hotel is new or almost, and design and furniture are very beautiful with attention to detail, form and function. I would send there some architects to get trained ! 
service is caring and attentive, and the lounge bar is a nice place to chat, navigate and sip a drink looking at other guests.  wifi is free everywhere.",5,2012,12,03
211,"Great hotel, but quite a distance from the city-center","My mom and I stayed at Croke Park Hotel during our last 2 nights in Dublin. After traveling all over Ireland and London, we were looking for a nice, clean hotel to unwind in before a trip back home to Chicago. Croke Park Hotel was it! 

The check-in experience was quick and quite unremarkable. However the lobby was very welcoming with Christmas decorations. The first floor lobby area is quite large, open and airy which makes you feel quite welcome and comfortable from the get-go. I appreciated the computers in the lobby which allowed for us to print our boarding passes the morning we left (at no cost).

We were delighted to find out that you can purchase hop-on-hop-off bus tour tickets from the front desk. We were also delighted that there was a shuttle bus that picks up at 9:30am to take you to your first stop (though there is no bus to return you back to the hotel in the evening). Additionally, there is a discount offered if you purchase them at the desk rather than waiting to get to town and purchase them at a bus stop, etc..

The room itself was one of the larger rooms we stayed in during our time in Europe and I was delighted with the large bathroom with a bathtub and shower option (which were separate of one another in the bathroom). The room did have a distinct chemical smell, probably from the cleaning supplies they used to clean the room. And although the smell was unpleasant, we aired the room out and quickly got rid of the odor (there was one window to open in the entire room, which only opened a crack, but enough for fresh air, etc.).

The bar/eating area on the first floor is fantastic! My mom and I had a relaxing drink in the bar the first afternoon, and I ordered their clam chowder which was out of this world delicious! We had dinner at the restaurant two nights, and I was able to try their mushroom lasagna which was also very good. The service is so-so. I wish our servers had been more attentive; we probably would have ordered more drinks! 

Breakfast is also served in/near the restaurant. The breakfast was one of the best we had on our trip (a cold, Continental spread with cheeses, fruit and pastry options, though there was a full hot breakfast option which was included for a price). The coffee was so-so. 

Quite honestly, the only drawback to the property is the distance to the city center. Although many people don't mind the walk, I was with my 60+ year old mom and on a cold night the last thing we wanted to do was walk or stand in the cold waiting for a bus or train. A cab was a much easier (though more costly) option. However, the hotel is within 10-15 mins. from the airport, which was convenient. 

I would stay here again, but it would not be my first choice when in Dublin, based solely on its proximity to the city center.",4,2012,12,02
211,Lovely hotel but beware of your belongings,"The hotel is lovely - no question. However, my Ipad was absolutely stolen out of my room.  There is no mistake about this. I realized it when I got home and called the hotel immediately.  I never felt that my situation was taken seriously. I was in America; they were in Ireland. There was nothing to do but be sad and disappointed. We loved our visit to Ireland, but bottom line - the hotel is great; the people were friendly; and my Ipad was stolen from my rooml in th Croke Hotel.",4,2012,12,01
211,"Good location, easily accessible","The Croke Park Hotel is a well run hotel with most amenities available to its guests.  It is close enough to the downtown hub of Dublin to walk to shopping, the Writer's Museum and if adventurous, or if wanting to grab a bus, to many of the museums and galleries, Trinity Dublin, and St. Stephen's Green. There are a few options for dining on site, and the lounge area is very nice for a drink.  There are many places to meet up with people, sit, or use the computer stations on the first floor. The service is very good and the concierge/attendants are eager to help.  While I was not there for sports activities at Croke Park Stadium, it is clearly the winner to stay here if that is your mission. Breakfast is quite good, with a variety of hot and cold items available.  The oatmeal itself is worth a special order!",4,2012,11,30
211,Very Pleasant Stay,"My son and I recently stayed at The Croke Park Hotel in Dublin and were very impressed with the friendly, efficient staff and comfortable rooms. The staff went out of their way to offer us advice on tours, restaurants and directions. Our room was tastefully decorated and the bathroom was modern and nicely sized. Highly recommended.",5,2012,11,28
211,Superb!,"My partner and I were treated to a trip to Dublin by the in-laws so we didn't know what to expect when we arrived at the hotel. However, we instantly felt welcomed by the very friendly staff who were happy to help with our queries of the best tourist attractions and places to eat etc. Although the hotel isn't placed in the most attractive of surroundings (directly opposite Croke Park Stadium) it more than made up for it with its interior. Our room was lovely, with a very comfortable bed, and the turn-down service with the 'lavender hottie' placed under the covers was a lovely welcome touch after a long day of sight-seeing! The extensive selection for breakfast was fabulous and we were spoiled for choice, and the service we received with our evening meal was top-class.  
We thoroughly enjoyed our trip to Dublin, and the quality of the hotel was the icing on the cake. We haven't stopped recommending it since we came home!",5,2012,11,28
211,Fantastic,"Stayed here to celebrate a friend's special birthday at a fantastic rate from alpharooms for B&B. We were very impressed with our rooms. Breakfast service was very efficient and the food excellent. The concierge gave us great advice on where to eat and was very helpful in arranging taxis into town and the airport when we needed them. A bus stops up the road and takes you into town for 60cents- we didn't bother with the hop on-off tour because the buses finished at 5pm. Reception staff were also friendly and it was a nice touch to get the offer of a bottle of water on check out. Would definitely recommend this hotel, and would love to stay there again. Be warned though- Dublin is very expensive!!",5,2012,11,27
211,Great place to stay,"Stayed here for five nights in July 2012 with my wife and 4 month old son.

This may be skewed, as this was the only hotel we stayed at in our month long trip to Ireland (the rest were hostels or B&Bs), but this place was amazing!  

Staff were great, dry breakfast every morning included, a drink every night included (the bar staff absolutely doted on the baby), and pack-n-play included.  Wifi and tv right in the room, and the famous Croke Park was right across the street (they even offer a discount on the tour with your hotel reservation).  Dinner at the hotel was reasonable for dinner at a hotel (and delicious).  The room could not have been nicer.  The price was high for us (we usually camp when staying in the USA, which is the cheapest way to go), but this stay was a present, so we didn't mind the price at all.

The only drawback was that it was a 15 minute walk to the closest of Dublin's attractions.  We didn't mind the walk much.  The walk was not the nicest part of the city, but nothing to worry about (other people said it was too sketchy to walk through, but I work in the murder capital of the USA, so it seemed like a lovely stroll to me).  For those not wanting to walk, the cab rate is about 15 euro one way from O'Connell Street.

Note: Take a walk on the canal the same side of the street as the hotel.  There is a half-sunk canal boat on that block that is very picturesque.",5,2012,11,26
211,Good hotel,Stayed here on our last night in country.  Arrived around 2p and were checked in without any issue.  Free parking in the garage underneath.  Room was small but nice.  Location wasn't super close to downtown but only a short cab ride after a night out in Temple Bar.  Was easy to get out in the morning and drive to the airport.  Friendly staff.,4,2012,11,25
211,Good hotel but Too far,"Just returned from Dublin and stayed at Croke Park Hotel.  From many of the reviews we read we were under the impression it was close enough to walk into the city centre.  That  is simply not true.  Even the staff told us it was too far to walk.  We did try it one evening and it took us thru sketchy neighborhoods and over a half hour in the rain.  The hotel itself is quite comfortable much like a holiday inn in states, no thrills but great bed  and space.  Shower was on same level as floor so there was puddles of water everytime we used it.  Staff was good, breakfast great,  but distance too far.  Westin is perfect location.",3,2012,11,24
211,The Best Place,"I have experienced staying in this hotel many times and I always look forward to it.  The staff are exceptional as are the rooms and breakfasts.  I especially love staying when there is not a big match as it can be so busy but the standards still don't slip.  One thing I miss and I don't know if its exclusive to me.  Twice I ran out of cash and had to walk to Drumcondra road for an ATM machine as there is no ""cashback"" facility when paying with credit cards.  I just wondered with the level of people who pass through this hotel especially on match week-ends when the place is thronged and, being that it is a quiet area would the hotel benefit from having an ATM machine installed?    Always looking forward to my next visit.   Thank you all!",5,2012,11,23
211,An awesome place to stay,"Croke Park Hotel is a warm and welcoming hotel.  The servie is excellent.  When did you last receive a hot towel to freshen up?  The rooms are rather spacious and immaculate.  The beds are very comfortable and ensure a good night's sleep.  The bathrooms comprise separate shower and bath tub. 
The nearest bus station is only about 500 metres away.  You are in town in no time.
This is definitely a hotel to revisit.",5,2012,11,22
211,Excellent service,"It all began well with our arrival to the hotel at 0630 after an overnight flight to Dublin. Damian greated us at the front desk and he went above and beyond to get us checked into our three rooms early. We were escorted by Damian to the breakfast buffet to eat while we had a short wait for our rooms to be ready early for us. The breakfast was amazing, the service was exceptional, the rooms were clean and comfortable, and the location was great-just a few kilometers walk or by bus or taxi into the heart of downtown Dublin.",5,2012,11,19
211,5 star service and quality,"We stayed in the Croke Park hotel for two nights ( 16th November- 18th November). We booked a deal via Travel Zoo for 170 euros for the entire stay. This included two nights bed and breakfast, one evening meal, two cocktails, two tickets to Guinness Store House and an upgrade to an executive room.The entire experience was absolutely divine. From the welcome at reception to the check out experience, everything was perfect. The room was clean, modern  and spacious . The bathroom had a separate shower and was spotless. There was a great variety of food for breakfast and staff were very friendly and efficient. The menu for the evening meal was very limited with a choice of 3 starters, main courses and desserts. The food was of a good standard but choices uninspiring. At night there was a turn down service available with a butlers chocolate provided beside the bed and a lavender scented hot water bottle placed in the bed. Overall everything was of 5 star quality with staff going the extra mile to make the stay exceptional",5,2012,11,19
211,Excellent hotel and fabulous staff,"I have recently returned from a few days in Dublin with my (older!) mum.  We stayed at the Croke Park Hotel and from the moment we arrived until we left we had the friendliest and most helpful service.  The hotel itself is immaculate and the staff could not have been more helpful and friendly.  Hot towels when we arrived, offer of use of the lounge until our rooms were ready (we were very early) bottles of water for our journey, help booking excursions etc.  The rooms were lovely and very clean and the food in the restaurants was great.  The hotel itself is a little bit out of the main area of Dublin but even for mum and me it was no more than a 15 - 20 minute walk, and on the way back there are plenty of taxis so its not really a problem.  It also means that its very quiet at night and I had great nights sleep as a result.  The only one drawback (if you can even call it that) is that there are not many restaurants or bars nearby so you really have to stay at the hotel (not an issue in my opinion) or go back into town if you want a night out, again not an issue but you do need taxis.  I would definitely stay there again.",5,2012,11,19
211,What a good choice!,"Just returned from a three night stay at the Croke Park, Dublin and it definitely lived up to the excellent reviews on TA. 
Able to access our room at 10.30 am, very friendly and helpful staff, comfortable quiet room, spacious public areas and a 15 min walk away from the main sights.
Our first visit to Dublin , hopefully will be back soon.",5,2012,11,18
211,Great hotel experience,"We stayed in the Croke Park hotel last week for 3 days.  It was an excellent experience - large rooms, king-size bed, great bathroom, free wi-fi.  Only downside was that it was a 10-euro taxi ride to city center (or the #16 bus runs there too).  Also, the king bed room was a 30-euro/night upgrade.  But that upgrade also came with 2 free drinks a night, access to the executive breakroom (free coffee, free continental breakfast), free turndown service (with a lavender-scented hot pack!), and nice robes.

I don't know if it was normal, but there was no fridge in the room, only a minibar.

Watch out for the smoking rooms - make sure to request a non-smoking room early.",4,2012,11,15
211,Excellent hotel not far from town centre,"A modern hotel as many are but a bit more space than you usually get. Good food, reasonable price. Taxi from hotel was straightforward and it is walkable to town. Staff were friendly and helpful. 

Only downside? Remember to take that complimentary bottle of water they give you out of your hand luggage when you get to airport security! :-)",5,2012,11,14
211,Extra Touches Go A Long Way!,"After arriving in Dublin, we quickly made our way from the airport to The Croke Park Hotel in a matter of minutes (20 to be exact).  The hotel has a great location for drivers...just a 15 minute walk from the city center, but not too close to get wrapped up in traffic.  The hotel's free parking for guests is also a nice feature.

As for our room...It was 'large' for European standards with a very nice bathroom.  Breakfast was excellent.  Besides offering all of the Irish standards the hotel did a great job with extra cheeses, meats, pastries, etc...

The property is very modern, yet has a cozy feel.  Upon checkout we were offered complementary bottled water to take with us.  Again, the extra touches and friendly staff really made this property special.  I'd recommend this hotel to anyone going to Dublin.",5,2012,11,13
211,Great family stay at Croke Park,"My husband, 1yr old son and I visited Croke Park hotel from 29th Oct - 1st Nov 2012, it was a great family style hotel. We had a family room spacious enough to consist of a double and single bed and a fold out cot. Even with all these beds my son still had space to crawl about and play freely. The hotel was well presented and clean, the staff were friendly and always willing to help and spend a few moments to play with my son. We stayed on a bed and breakfast basis and feel they had a vast selection of hot and cold options to suit all our needs. The hotel is located about 15mins walk from the city centre, but we enough walking and do not find this a major problem. I would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone visiting Dublin!",5,2012,11,13
211,"Great hotel, highly recommend it!","This hotel was wonderful, friendly staff, fantastic room and great breakfast! I will be recommending this to any of my friends who go to Dublin. The hotel was slightly out of the centre of town though, walkable, or about a €6-€10 taxi ride. Was about €20 from the airport. ",5,2012,11,12
211,weekend stay,i highly recommend this croke park hotel package if its on offer with upgrade to deluxe rooms.the staff are all very helpful and attentive  and the rooms are very large you also have the use of the executive lounge plus evening meal and a free cocktail.,5,2012,11,12
211,Lovely Hotel and staff,"Lovely hotel, staff very friendly and couldn't be more helpful. Room big, immaculately clean with extra amenities such as the music system. Stylish bar and lounge areas, food good. Had a lovely time, would definitely stay again.",5,2012,11,12
211,What a Reception,"Free underground parking and then up the lift to reception and what a greeting! I believe the receptionist is called Eimear ( hard to read the name badge without being rude ). What a warm greeting. She professionally ran through the hotel facilities, things of interest in fact if she had wanted to sell me something I am in no doubt I would have bought - she painlessly signed me up for the hotel's locality scheme.
The room was excellent, roomy, comfortable, clean and everything we needed.
Bar was bright & busy and the prices were reasonable, €22 for a respectable bottle of house wine,
And the food was also reasonable.
A quick 5 min walk along the canal brought us up onto the bus route were number 11 or 16 ( every 10 mins ) for less than €2 took us into the centre. Note only coins accepted on the bus no notes.
With our shopping we jumped into a taxi back just up from the GPO and that was €6.80.
Breakfast was good - all in all highly recommended.",5,2012,11,11
211,Excellent hotel,Stayed here for 2 nights recently. We normally frequent the bar as GAA fans having attended a match at Croke Park however this was a totally different experience. It a was a fantastic experience from the time we arrived at reception to check in till our departure. Lovely ambiance and pure luxury. Food at the restaurant was gorgeous and staff all round couldnt have been any better. Would highly recommend to anyone..........will return again for a stay but we'll be back long before then to celebrate another Dubs win!!!!!!,5,2012,11,11
211,"Clean, friendly, comfortable","I highly recommend the Discover Dublin package if they offer it. It included the full Irish breakfast, tickets to the hop-on, hop-off bus, a map of Dublin and a complimentary cocktail. THe staff was friendly and attentive, the rooms clean and bright, and the beds are comfortable with plenty of pillows.",5,2012,11,09
211,Very pleasant stay,"Got there way earlier than check-in time, but the room was ready, which was great. Staff was very nice and helpful. Room was big and clean, and with all the facilities expected and more.
Lounge was very nice, as well as the bar, and the library, though little, it was cosy. 
Would definitely stay again!
The only thing was that it was a bit cold at night.
Not far from the centre, 10 minutes by bus or so, and they were frequent.",5,2012,11,08
211,Dublin at its best,"Don't be put off by the exterior.  This is a wonderful hotel with excellent staff.  It is in a good location, handy for the town centre and the O2 Arena (and, of course, great sport at Croke Park).  Treat yourself to an executive room with your own lounge, King Size beds and extra amenities.  The staff can't do enough for you.  Relax and enjoy the food in the Sideline Bistro - beautiful food, well presented.  I can't recommend it enough",5,2012,11,07
211,Helpful and pleasant staff compensate for poor room checks.,"Reception and Restaurant staff are extremely pleasant and helpful. Room obviously not properly checked before use -  three light bulbs were not working. Mini bar was empty, but staff were so pleasant it didnt seem to matter.  Meal in restaurant served by very pleasant waiter was the best burger I ever had!!  Do not walk around in this area at night - taxi essential.",4,2012,11,07
211,"5* service, wonderful plush hotel.","Just returned from a wonderful 3 night break at this lovely hotel, for myself & my partners first trip to Dublin.
The staff were so friendly & welcoming, we arrived at 9:45am after an early AM flight, and were pleasantly surprised to be told they had a room ready for us right away as I thought we would've had to leave our cases and come back later to check in. Also they extended our check out on our last day til 1pm without any charge. I really appreciated these kind gestures, they made a big difference to our overall stay.
The rooms were lovely and the bed was huge and very comfortable. The room maids did a brilliant job and we came back one night to see they had left chocolates for us and a lavender hot water bottle in our bed which was a lovely unexpected touch.
Other nice touches like hot towels to warm your hands on arrival and giving you a bottle of water for your journey back home were much appreciated.
We didn't eat at the restaurant but we did have a cocktail in the bar, loved the atmosphere and the decor, very warm and welcoming.
The only slight downside is the location, being 15min walk away from city centre, but this is something we were well aware of before we went. To be honest if this class of hotel was right in the city centre I would expect it to be twice the price AT LEAST. we got an amazing deal and so didn't mind the distance at all, in fact was quite nice to get away from the buzz of the centre sometimes and relax in the hotel. 
It felt like a 5* hotel and I would highly recommend it to all!",5,2012,11,07
211,"Amazing service, nothing was too much trouble.","Our trip started badly as the airline lost our luggage, but the hotel staff were amazing. They provided us with toiletries and even loaned us a phone charger. The concierge was a daily blessing, providing maps, bottled water, advice and a welcoming smile. Unfortunately our first room was over tha bar so our first night was rather noisy, but the staff were more than happy to help the following morning, moving us to an equally lovely room on the 3rd floor. 
 The hotel is within easy walking distance of the centre of Dublin, although not in the most salubrious of areas, we found Dubliners to be very friendly and most helpful, always happy to give directions or recommend a good pub or restaurant. 
 The food at the hotel was very good, and reflective of Dublin prices.  Fab Hotel, Fab staff, thank you.",4,2012,11,07
211,Top Class,"Just back from a TravelZoo offer to Doyle Collection, Croke Park Hotel. Superb accomodation, food,staff and facilities plus excellent customer service!! Highly recommended to all.
10min waalk to O Connell street and purchase your hop on/off bus tickets at recption for discount!!!",5,2012,11,06
211,Awesome amenities ,"This is one of the best hotels I've stayed in, and I mean worldwide! Great rooms, comfy beds, and an all-around excellent atmosphere. The staff went out of their way to solve a problem we had, which isn't even worth mentioning due to their efficient solving. Do stay, you'll love it!!",5,2012,11,06
211,great 2 night stay,"Arrived on friday 3rd Nov for a 2 night stay, part of a travel zoo package,with complimentary cocktails and visit to Guinness factory,Hotel was very welcoming on arrivel, stephen the receptionist was very prompt and helpful checking us in.The rooms are clean,spacious,bright and airy. The beds were massive and really comfortable.
We had a meal the 1st night of the stay and the food was lovely, service very good and staff very attentive.I work in a hotel myself so i can be particular, the only thing i would say that was bad was waiting 10 mins are so on the sat morning to get a breakfast table,it was 10.15 and it was probably the last min rush,its just there didnt seem to be enough room for all the guests at once.
An overall enjoyable stay and we would go again.
The hotel is about 20 min walk into busy dublin. taxi varied from 8.50 euro to 10.00.",4,2012,11,06
211,Very confortable rooms and friendly personnel,"Very satisfied with my overnight stay in this hotel. The location is not ideal for tourism purposes as one has to walk quite a lot to the center and the area, next to a stadium wasn´t the best for us. Nevertheless the nice rooms with free internet  and very good personnel made for the only negative points.",4,2012,11,06
211,for sure a great hotel.,"my wife booked this hotel because she was doing the dublin marathon,when she finished all she wanted to do was relax in a lovely bath,this hotel was lovely and so was the staff.i would recommend this hotel as looks very posh from the outside but humble on the inside.",5,2012,11,05
211,Great hotel,our experience inthe Croke Park Hotel was plesent one. I stayed there with my brother and three kids for two nights.  All the staff were very friendly with us from the minute we walked in the door they really made  us feel welcome.  The food in the bar was very good.  The rooms were lovely and spacious and kept really clean.  We enjoyed our stay so much we tried to get an extra nite but the hotel was totally booked out but they staff were so nice they rang around a few places they knew to accommodate us.  Would go back ere again no problem,5,2012,11,05
211,Croke Park Hotel is a winner,"We have just had a fantastic 2 night stay in the Croke Park Hotel, Dublin and can't recommend it highly enough. It is just across the road from the famous football stadium of the same name and I'm sure the craic is mighty on match days. We got a good offer through Travelzoo, which included bed and breakfast, a room upgrade, dinner on one night and tickets to visit the Guinness Storehouse. 

The hotel itself is relatively new, of modern design and very high quality in terms of decoration, furnishings and spotlessly clean. All the staff we interacted with were extremely friendly and helpful. At the end of breakfast on the first morning we asked for capuccino coffees, which were quickly delivered. On the second morning we were asked if we wanted capuccinos. Now that's good service.

The breakfast buffet is excellent with an extensive range to ensure something for all tastes. The menu also offers porridge on request. Our dinner on the first night was from a special menu and was excellent in terms of quality of food and presentation.
 
Car parking is available on site and  free for guests, which is very unusual for city centre hotels but very welcome saving around 20 euro per night. Throughout the hotel wifi is freely available, so bring your laptop or iPad if you want to keep in touch.

I had read some previous reviews suggesting the location is not ideal. I disagree. It is approx 15 minutes walking from the city centre, or a short taxi ride. We walked into the centre on Friday night and got a taxi back costing 8 euro. On Saturday we walked both ways, which meant I didn't feel so guilty having a large breakfast !! Also, I think there is a main bus route a short walk away. 

The hotel was busy during our stay, with a wide range of accents heard, so it's repution is obviously known far and wide. My wife and I will definitely stay again in the Croker !!!",5,2012,11,05
211,Wonderful Stay in Dublin,"We came by the Croke Park Hotel while searching for reasonable priced locations slightly out of the business central of Dublin (October 2012).  This hotel is situated perfectly for those looking for a quieter location close to both the airport and city central.  Only about 10 - 15 min walk to O'Connell Street.  Lovely accommodations, nicely appointed, exceptionally helpful concierge service and front staff.  Food is great as well. Highly recommend the upgrade as it included the executive lounge, breakfast and two drinks / per room nightly.  Excellent location for the value, would definitely stay again when traveling to Dublin or abroad.",5,2012,11,04
211,great break,stayed here weekend of marathon.had 2 grandchildren with us.this hotel is extremely child friendly.They were given books and a big box of lego on arrival.also given colouring materials later while we were in the bar.staff were exceptional couldn't do enough for us.food was superb.rooms were very big and spotless.would highly recommend this hotel.,5,2012,11,02
211,Had a amazing stay at this hotel!,"The croke park hotel, is a very pleasant place to stay! I recommend it to anyone who wants to visit Dublin, its well priced and the rooms are kept very clean and are good sized! All the staff are friendly and helpful and therefore very welcoming. I would most definitely stay at this hotel again! Thank you! Oscar Mullin. Room 321",5,2012,11,01
211,Gets better each stay!,"I've been staying in the Croke Park Hotel for three years now and every stay seems to exceed the previous one.  The hotel is very busy these days but that does not effect the service offered.  Rooms are very comfortable and quiet; breakfast a wonderful spread but most of all, the staff are very well trained in providing an excellent service to their guests.  Special word of mention to the bar staff who are so cheerful and friendly even when dealing with a very busy bar.",5,2012,11,01
211,great family hotel,"Had a mid-term break here and the service, food and facilities were excellent.  
The staff are so helpful and pleasant and can't do enough to make your stay perfect.  The rooms are very clean and great comfortable beds and BiG showers as well as a bath - lots of toiletries and fluffy white face cloths.  A fridge and wine glasses also supplied as well as a music centre and free wi-fi :)  All round excellent and the kids loved looking out at Croke park !!! from their bedroom window - Amazing :)",5,2012,11,01
211,"Hard to fault, very nice hotel","Getting to the hotel is straightforward, from the airport take the airlink coach ( 6 euros) to Drumcondra road, it's a short walk from there. The hotel is opposite the huge stadium. This hotel is relatively inexpensive by Dublin standards but it's exceptionally well equipped. The staff are friendly , attentive and the rooms are spacious, clean, modern and with all amenities. The wifi is free and fast, the gym is well equipped.",5,2012,10,31
211,Would definitely stay again.,"We stayed at the Croke Park Hotel for a few nights, as some of our group were taking part in the Dublin Marathon.  We were very impressed.  All the staff were friendly and helpful.  The breakfast was delicious and was served until 10.30 am, which was perfect for us as we got to have a bit of a lie-in after the marathon!  The rooms were comfortable and well equipped.  The walk into town wasn't as far as I thought it might be - it only took us about 10 minutes.  We would definitely stay at this hotel again.",5,2012,10,31
211,"Upscale hotel, 20 minutes from city center.","A good 20 minute walk to get downtown. Neighborhood is a safe but lower income area.
The Croke Park Hotel is a very nice property. Rooms and baths are clean and modern. Lovely finishes throughout the hotel. The only downside to the hotel is if you want to be close to the city center. It is a good 20 minute walk to downtown Dublin and the Croke Park neighborhood, while safe, is a lower income area. However, we spent a week there, walking downtown everyday and had no problems.",5,2012,10,30
211,Lovely hotel even lovelier staff.,"Wonderfully placed hotel . The staff were most obliging and seemed to smile a lot(a pleasant change to some hotels)The rooms were spotless and the breakfasts unbeatable dinner was also really tasty.The one very unpleasant happening on one of our nights stay was  the guests in the next room to us were extremely noisy and did not seem to care about other guests.So bad in fact that I contacted the concierge at 3 am to complain,he immediately sent security to the room ,he remonstrated with them and we had peace for an hour only for them to commence once again with the racket ,I again phoned the front desk who again sent security who was much more adamant with them,at last some tranquility.I thank the staff for their prompt and finally decisive action but fully understand I was asking a lot of them to control MORONS.",5,2012,10,30
211,If only I could have stayed longer !,"I feel it would be remiss of me not to share with others my thoughts on an extremely enjoyable and relaxing stay at this hotel. Unfortunately, I was unable to prolong my visit on this occasion but I definetly plan to return. The hotel simply "" oozes"" efficiency and professionalism in a quiet, unassuming way. Staff are happy to be of assistance and  guests are made welcome. There is always service with a smile. I know from experience that  good practice just doesn't happen. The members of staff at all levels in this hotel are well trained and it shows.
The decor throughout is modern and tasteful. Bedrooms are spacious and very well maintained. There is a high standard of cleanliness and the amenities are superb. .The ensuite bathroom will not disappoint the most fastidious ,""pamper conscious"" guest.. My bedroom overlooked the courtyard so i cannot say the view was exciting but  it was not unpleasant.
 Breakfast is served in pleasant surroundings and the food  selection is wide and varied and appetising.. The dining room staff are pleasant and willing to please.
The hotel's location is its one drawback. Great for sports fans, i acknowledge, but the distance from all other tourist attractions may prove prohibitive for the faint hearted. or elderly or solo traveller. However taxis can be ordered at a moment's notice  and since the hotel has so many excellent things to offer it would be a shame if the distance to the City centre  would act as a deterent 
thanks for a lovely stay and my only regret is that i couldn't stay longer!.",5,2012,10,29
211,Very nice!,"Although the Croke Park Hotel is outside the city center it's absolutely worth staying there. The staff was welcoming and very helpfull during our stay. Tourist information, arranging a taxi, transportation options downtown: the front desk was very service minded and kind. Service with a smile! Our room was big, on the 4th (executive) floor, very clean and quietly situated. We booked via Hotwire a very good rate and upgraded paying €30 extra per night. This included breakfast, vouchers for a drink each night, access to the executive lounge (free water, coffee, tea, fruit, newspapers and nice sitting area) and in the evening someone prepared the beds for nighttime.
Breakfast was nice. Several kinds of bread, pastries, fresh fruit etc. Internet free and of good speed.
Dining options in hotel restaurant and bar. Barmeals not expensive and good quality. Drinks good price too.
Transportation from airport easy by bus or taxiride. Downtown the busstop is a 5 minute walk towards drumcondra road. Several busses take you to the city center within a couple of minutes. Rates low but remind to have small change. 
We will absolutely visit Dublin again and propable the Croke Park Hotel. We loved it!",5,2012,10,29
211,A great weekend...,"A great hotel, very friendly staff, very nice food (one of the best chicken Caesar salads I had in a long time) and ridiculously comfortable beds....

The room had everything and more than one would expect, including an iHome docking station, my room also had a separate bath and an ample shower space, plenty of storage... Everything you need, really, and more.
A really nice touch - they put a lavender scented hot water bottle in your bed, how great is that?!!

Probably the only regret - we didn't get round to visiting Croke Park stadium, next time we really must!!",5,2012,10,29
211,Great hotel. Great value,"A lovely room for the money in a well-located hotel. Charming staff and a lovely breakfast. Hotel highly recommended, but not the restaurant (see separate review). Would definitely stay here again though. ",5,2012,10,29
211,Fantastic Hotel & Staff,We recently stayed at this hotel on our honeymoon. The staff went out of their way to make our stay as special as they possibly could. We were given a room upgrade and use of the executive lounge and had champagne delivered to our room. The price we paid for this hotel was way below what I would expect to pay for a hotel of this standard. It is only a 10-15 minute walk to O'Connell Street and is a fantastic base for exploring the city. 10 out of 10!!!,5,2012,10,27
211,Excellent Hotel,"Four of us stayed for three nights in October. Chosen from the internet, and we couldn't believe our luck to find such a great hotel. The rooms were fine; the staff were the most helpful we've met; the food was excellent and the free use of the hotel's computers to e-mail home etc was a life saver.
Although there is a twenty minute walk to the city centre, this means that the surrounding area is very quiet - almost like staying in the country!
We noticed that United Airlines use the hotel for their staff, so that must say something.
Anyone staying in Dublin can't do better than stay at this hotel!!!",5,2012,10,27
211,A Little Peace Near A Huge Sports Arena,"We were at Croke Park Hotel during the All Ireland Football game between Mayo and Dublin.  The big game was on Sunday and the hotel lobby was just packed with fans from both sides and hotel guests.  It was actually fun to see the fans and their enthusiasm for their teams.  The minute you got on the lift and went to the peace and quiet of your room---that is what you had! Peace and quiet!  So while crowds were in the lobby and gobs of people in the streets surrounding the hotel, there was still blessed peace in very comfortable, clean, lovely rooms.  Our room overlooked the Royal Canal and we watched barges and swans sharing the waterway which was again very peaceful.  The staff was very accommodating with our questions and concerns.  The hotel has a wonderful breakfast buffet with hot and cold foods, our dinner was also very good.  We would recommend Croke Park even though it is a bit of distance from the center of town and, yes, do take a cab unless you are in for a bit of a stroll.",4,2012,10,27
211,Really excellent!!!!!,"My boyfriend and I were in the Croke Park Hotel in Dublin for one week holiday.
It is really a great place to spend your holiday in Dublin. The position is not in the centre, but it was not a problem for us to reach the main street, O'Connel Street (It takes a 20 minutes walking). All staff is very kind and helpful. There is an italian girl who served us the breakfast, she was very polite and nice with us!! The room was clean and homely!! We had a king bed... (very big!), the bathroom is big, clean with shower and bathtub. I advice this hotel!!!!!! :)",5,2012,10,27
211,Read my review and judge for yourself,Booked a double room non smoking.   Arrived and got two singles.  Back to reception and offered double in smoking room or double on ground floor. Accepted double on ground.  Double on ground is a Murphy bed.  Its two star standard.  My bank holiday weekend is spoiled.   Oh and checking our bed and pillows I find one stained and unwashed    I have stayed here many times and it's a lovely hotel.  And they simply should not have rooms of this grade          The duty manager did offer free drinks which we declined. I just wanted what we booked.,1,2012,10,26
211,Great Again,"This was our second visit. We stayed four days this time & found the staff friendly and professsional, going out of their way to help. We have stayed in three hotels in Dublin, and while we enjoyed the other two,this hotel is definitely our favourite, despite a less central position. During the day it is a 20 minute walk into the centre but at night I would recommend getting a taxi back to the hotel. The free parking for guests is good, as we have paid quite high charges more centrally. The executive rooms on the fourth floor are particularly good as there is an excellent executive lounge where a complimentary continental breakfast is served & hot & cold drinks & biscuits during the day.",5,2012,10,26
211,Nicely Done!,"We spent the night on our last day in Ireland at the Croke Park Hotel in Dublin, Ireland.  We had previously stayed a week in a villa in Adare, Ireland.  Upon arriving at the hotel we were a little concerned at where it was located...across from Croke Park...Dublin's soccer stadium.  Luckily the most recent game had been played just the day before and so we did not have the burden of listening to the noise of thousands of fans or the crowd after the game.  Also the hotel is a little out of the way meaning a cab would be necessary to get to the center of town.  But that aside, we found the hotel a 5-star quality.  The room we had was perfect and very clean as well.  The dining room for breakfast was big and the buffet was very good.  We enjoyed our stay even if it was for only one night.  I would highly recommend this hotel.",5,2012,10,25
211,Still a very good hotel,"Once again this hotel was very nice, a good value and is a convenient location.  The rooms are clean and well tended to by the staff.  Was a little disappoionted in the staff in the bar at night.  They seemd to be more interested in their socializing than being attentive to the guests.  The staff was young and it seemd not very well supervised.  I expect more.  That said the rest of the staff was their usual attentive self.",4,2012,10,25
211,love this hotel,"This is our third or fourth stay here and we have no complaints about it at all. We got a really good deal through olotels and after a long drive from cornwall we couldnt choose a better hotel. Its easy to get to from the port, the car park is free which is a huge bonus, the family room we had was massive, two double beds and a single with loads of floor space for our four year old to play on,the bathroom was lovely and everywhere was very clean. The walk into the city does take a while about 20mins with a child in tow but its a nice easy walk, we had a wonderful dinner in the bar very very tasty and breakfast is always really good with a great choice not alot more to say just a very very good hotel, we will be back",5,2012,10,24
211,probably best hotel ever stayed in!!!,spent 3 great nights here.superb breakfast with great variety.very friendly staff.what we liked as well was the free wi-fi good selection of tv channels at no extra cost.good bar area that is not expensive like other hotel bars.location was not a problem for us but is a 10 to 15 minute walk to the centre.taxi back is only 5 to 6 euros,5,2012,10,24
211,"welcoming , honest, clean and friendly","Stayed here on the 20th - 23rd October with my husband, staff very friendly, food very good, could not find fault really, only downfall is the area, not very safe to walk around in the evening so spend a little and take a taxi",4,2012,10,24
211,Good Stay but not a Great Stay,"We stayed here as part of a packaged deal with a tour company that booked us 4 hotels across Ireland.  This was the last of the hotels we were staying at before we left for the airport.  We stayed at The Heritage Golf and Spa, Kilarney Park Hotel and The G Hotel.  If I was to rate this hotel compared the quality of service and comfort then I would place it last.  

We were really disappointed to see that the room we booked had a double sized bed.  The same booking for the other 3 hotels had given us a king size bed.  I had mentioned this to the front desk and they politely responded with this is the room we booked.  This made our sleep a bit of a tight squeeze.  Our bathroom looked like it required just a bit of work, as every shower basically leaked over the floor.  And we were not provided bathrobes and slippers.  The parking was ample but every time we entered the hotel we were required to get a parking ticket, which we had to get cleared every time we left at the front desk.  The elevator from the parking basement only reached the first floor, then required us to move to another elevator to get to our rooms.

Now I know it sounds like I am nit picking, but when you pay for a good hotel room you have a few expectations.  It is the small issues that separates the good hotel from a great hotel.

Aside the small issues, the staff was very friendly the rooms were very clean.  The room service food was delicious.  There is good wifi signal in the room we stayed and there were printers on the main floor where we could print out plane tickets.",4,2012,10,22
211,A Gem in Dublin,"Having decided to stay here on business I was a little apprehensive to discover the ""free on site parking"" was an underground car park with a maximum height clearence of 2.0M, so my 2.7M van  just wasn't going to fit. Howver, the friendy conceige gentleman allowed me to park in the coack parking area. 
The discounted price of the hotel was similar to staying at a Premier In in the UK but that is wgere all similarities ended.
The bedroom was amazing, a really really large double bed, memory foam from the feel, lovely pillows, mini bar (chargeable) but best of all especially fore the bsuiness guest was (1) a good sized desk (2) a good sized and sturdy chair but soft seat and (3) electrical sockets that were fitted into the top of the desk so any appliance such as mobile chargers / laptop chargers could be inserted easily and not like in some establishments in the UK when you just can't fit the plu in because it's too near the floor or the edge of the desk.
Bar area was good, meals served here most of day.
Restaurant was good too, served from 6pm. I did choose to dine in the restaurant and despite having a bit of a setback with my main course, the setback was handled very professionally and I would definately dine here again.
Agem, that's what the Croke Park Hotel is. 
Thanks to all for making one day in Dublin really enjoyable.",5,2012,10,19
211,Nothing special but did the job.,"We chose this hotel because of the ""stay 3 nights, pay for 2"" deal. This was one of the cheapest options with a decent rating for staying in Dublin.

We found the location to be excellent. Without paying the city centre prices, it was a simple walk to the top of O'Connell street and Temple Bar; we felt no need to rely on public transport at any point. It was a 20 Euro taxi from the airport, and right next to the Croke Park Stadium, which offers a landmark as well as an interesting tour (regardless of your interest or knowledge of Gaelic Sports). 

The hotel itself was well designed and well maintained, although we found it was not up to 4 star standards throughout the hotel room. The plug hole kept making slurping noises at random intervals and shower knobs had bits missing. The room was a good size and for the most part, very well kept. 

The major issue we had with the hotel was the unfriendly and often condescending staff. There was one member of staff who was very helpful, but the others appeared quite patronising. I cannot fault the results, but their attitude did not make us feel welcome to be there. They had informed us on check-in that the price had included breakfast, but the next morning that was not the case and yet they sat us down without explaining if we did have to pay or if they had resolved the matter. As it happened, they had expected us to pay without informing us, which we felt was quite presumptuous and arrogant. 

I'd say it was a case of the hotel striving to be 5 star with a pretentious attitude, yet the prices and standards did not reflect this and not all of the customers will have money to burn. Despite the general unfriendliness, the hotel itself was ideal for a city break and was excellent value for money.",3,2012,10,17
211,Great Hotel,"Just had one night in the hotel Saturday 13th October and this is my fourth time to stay at the Croke Park and once again I can't fault the place.  Easy to get to (coming from the North or the airport if you fly into Dublin), convenient underground carpark with lift to reception. Fast check in with helpful staff who have good local knowledge.  Rooms spacious and clean, we had a triple room and it was massive with 3 large beds and a bathroom with seperate bath and double shower which was lovely.  
The hotel is a bit out of the way but it makes up for it in standard.  We walked into Dublin centre on Saturday afternoon (it was a warm sunny day) and it took about 20 mintues to O'Cconnel St.  Bus back out No 11 is €1.40 and we got off at Quinns pub on the Drumcondra road about a 5 minute walk from the hotel.  Taxis from the hotel are circa €10 into town and we used these at night time.  Breakfast was great in the morning, full selection of cooked and continental and very good indeed.  Will definatley return.",4,2012,10,15
211,Very Nice Hotel,"This is a lovely hotel.  Staff was warm and friendly and very helpful as well.  Room was spacious, quiet and immaculate.  We stayed on the executive floor and had a nice continental breakfast.  There is a refrigerator stocked with water and fruit drinks for the guests as well.",5,2012,10,14
211,Lovely hotel,I stayed in the hotel earlier this year. Its a very nice hotel with good facilities and great choice and variety for breakfast. The only downside I have to mention is that I wish the hotel had been sign posted better as I found it difficult to find even though I had a fair knowledge of the area. Also I think hotel should have some information in rooms relating to public transport connections near the hotel as taxis in Dublin tend to be expensive. Also be aware of huge crowds on days when Croke Park stadium is in use!!,4,2012,10,13
211,Wonderful Experience,"I spent 13 day here very recently. The place is immaculate, very well run and staffed by terrific, upbeat and very helpful people. The breakfast buffet was excellent, with tea/coffee/toast delivered to your table by servers. My room faced the front of the hotel but was very quiet at night. The hotel's location was distant for me to walk to the tourist area of 'downtown' Dublin. But, then again, I knew this before I booked. and I am not able to walk long distances. Taxis, for me, were a reasonable option, and that's what I used. I give this fine hotel a gold star and an 'excellent' rating.",5,2012,10,13
211,A Gem of a Hotel!,"We found the Croke Park Hotel from checking reviews on Trip Advisor and couldn't be more pleased.  We had a very modern, quiet, well-appointed room with a king-size bed that was particularly comfortable and enjoyed both a tasty dinner and a generous breakfast in the hotel restaurant.  Although the location is adjacent to a large stadium we had some difficulty in finding the hotel in our rental car but after stopping for directions from local residents were delighted to find that the hotel had good, easily accessible parking.  The staff couldn't have been more helpful.  Although it was our last night in Ireland we left looking forward to returning.  ",4,2012,10,11
211,At the risk of sounding repetitive!,"It is so important to let people who do a fantastic job know that they do just that!  At the risk of sounding repetitive, my husband and I have just returned from this brilliant hotel again!  The thing is - we keep trying other places for variety and to be honest they just pale by comparison to the Croke Park and its fabulous staff and surroundings!!!!  We just gravitate back each time - The room we stayed in was sparkling clean as usual - in fact, so clean that I thought it newly decorated and it wasn't - their standards are so high that this is the norm there.  No - I don't have shares in the place!!  We have stayed in cities all over the world, ie Paris, London, Edinburgh, Glasgow ..... This is easily the best we've ever experienced.  See our earlier reviews, I'd have said it was impossible to improve on what they'd already offered but somehow they just go from strength to strength.  There's a warmth and familiarity at the Croke Park and to be honest, I think its largely due to the fabulous staff who take their job very seriously and although their schedules are hectic, they still have time for pleasantries.  All room standards are excellent, I'd particularly recommend you stay deluxe - you have a bed turn down service, luxury sweets by the bed, luxury lavender hotwater bottles, fluffy robes and slippers!  The food is excellent and as I have a Vegan diet it was no trouble catering for me in again and again! - something which I can tell you is not the norm ... I was even offered Soya Milk at breakfast and I didn't even have to ask for it!!  If you are going to Dublin and haven't already been here just go -  It's everything I've said and more - You won't be disappointed!!!",5,2012,10,08
211,Great Hotel Inside Dull Exterior,"Driving up to the Croke Park, I was a little leery as the exterior was dull and a little stained.  Inside is quite a different story.  Very modern!  Exceptionally clean (as were all the hotels we visited in Ireland).  Of the five hotels we visited in Ireland, the Croke had the least friendly staff but we were served well.  Food was quite good, but short of excellent.  Several of our fellow travelers had trouble with their security entrance cards as did we.  However, the situation was remedied with good grace.  There were no instructions in the room for operations of the different appliances,  

The hotel is right across from Croke Park Stadium so beware of LARGE, no, HUGE, enthusiastic crowds during events.  The taxi ride from downtown Dublin runs around 10 Euro.  Several others were gouged by over twice that amount by unscrupulous drivers.",4,2012,10,06
211,Wonderful service! A 5 star experience,"After finding the Croke Park Hotel on Trip Advisor, we stayed there from Sept 17-Sept 21 2012. What a lovely time we had! We have two young children, and the staff truly went above and beyond to make our stay stress free and enjoyable. Our kids were thrilled with the lego bin they got to play with for the three days we were there! Chris, the concierge, was helpful and kind in all his recommendations. Our stay in Dublin was the beginning of a two week vacation, and my husband said over and over again how he wished we would have saved the Croke Park Hotel for the end of the trip because no other place would be able to live up to it! The rooms are beautiful, breakfast wonderful, and you leave there feeling truly pampered. We will definitely be staying there on our next trip to Ireland. Thank you for the lovely time! 

By the way, it was a little out of the way from the main sites of Dublin, but we were able to walk to St. Stephen's Green with our two young children. We did end up taking taxis to Temple Bar for dinner, but it was relatively affordable at about 10 euro each way. We were on vacation after all!",5,2012,10,05
211,Nice hotel - but not a good location for discovering the city!,"This was a hard hotel to rate, as I wanted to give the hotel itself a four, but the location a two. Ended up on a three. The hotel is right next door to Croke Park, so if you're there to watch some games - the location is probably good. If you're in Dublin to discover and explore the city, the location is pretty terrible. Right of the plane I was surprised when I told the air coach-salesman that I wanted to go to the city center, Croke Park, and he answered, ""That's not in the city centre - that's the outskirts."". It really is, and it's a pretty long and very uninteresting walk, so we had to buy day passes for the bus for the four days we were there. 

As for the hotel itself, we really enjoyed the breakfast and service. The room was pretty small, but I suppose many triple rooms are as small. Just don't expect any space to move around...

So the hotel was ok, but the location (and the surroundings, might I add, with dog poo-littered walkways and nothing interesting nearby) really made our stay a lot less pleasurable than it could have been. 

If you're in Dublin to see the city, I'd suggest getting something around the Temple Bar district or other parts of the proper city centre.",3,2012,10,05
211,Topnotch!,When I had my vacation down the south of Ireland I choose this place coz' it was recommended by a friend. And it was heaven coz all the staff's were very great and it's located at the very center of the city.  My family enjoyed very much and satisfied. We will be back again for sure...,5,2012,09,30
211,Great hotel in a great city,"We only had 2 nights in Dublin & chose the Croke Park because they offer free parking & we had a hire car. Wonderful modern hotel. Large bathroom with plenty of room to put 2 toiletries bags. This may sound strange but so many hotels don't have anywhere to put your things in the bathroom. Chair plus chaise in room. Large bed. Iron & trouser press. Was disappointed when we saw the mini bar fridge was the type that charge you automatically if you move anything but a simple request & it was emptied promptly so that we could place our own items in there.
The customer service was impressive. I misplaced my glasses one evening & thought I may have left them in the bar. I telephoned down & within 5 minutes someone was at my door to return my glasses! In fact they weren't mine! I found them in my room (oops!) but that doesn't take away the fact that they went out of their way I help me. Any questions at the front desk were dealt with friendliness & helpfulness.
The hotel has a big bar. I don't usually drink at hotel bars but my husband & I popped in & had drink while sitting on a super comfy lounge & watched a game on the giant screen. I imagine that this place gets rather crowded after games at the stadium across the street.
The distance into the main area of Dublin wasn't an issue. A 60c bus fare from up the road (3-5 min walk) had us in O'Connell st (shopping precinct) within a couple of minutes. That evening we caught a taxi back & it was 8 Euro. The ease of getting to the airport in the morning from the north side of the river & city as well as the free parking outweighed any need we had to stay in the centre of Dublin.",4,2012,09,28
211,Really lovely hotel,"Modern, but not stark and cold.  Beautifully appointed.  There is a stunning, very modern fireplace in one of the reception rooms, so inviting.  Staff was very helpful.  Breakfast was everything you could want and then some.  I also had my first cup of American coffee that actually tasted really good. It is also spotlessly clean.",4,2012,09,21
211,Best Customer Service That I Have Ever Received,"I can't say enough positive things about the wonderful customer service that I have received over the past week from Russell Hadley and Sean Reid of the Croke Park Hotel. 

I had an issue where my tour operator didn't honour a booking that I made from Canada. While it was outside the Croke Park Hotel's jurisdiction, these two gentlemen contacted my tour operator and fixed the problem for me. 

I am very impressed at the level of service I was provided, because it was a booking that was not within Croke Park's control or jurisdiction, yet they still looked into it for me. Anyone who stays at Croke Park is very lucky indeed. 
 
I am looking forward to staying with this hotel in two weeks.  The staff have already demonstrated a level of customer service - that is gracious, kind and thoughtful - that I have never experienced before. 

Both gentlemen spent time away from their regular duties to help me, often outside of regular work hours. They made a difference in my travel experience and for that, I am very grateful.",5,2012,09,21
211,Great Hotel,"The Croke Park hotel has beautiful large rooms and modern bathroom.  The beds are comfortable  and the room is spotlessly clean.  Free wifi internet was included and worked in our room. They have a restaurant - food was great but there are other local pubs walking distance from the hotel.  The hotel is located across the street from the Croke Park Stadium.  Though its on the outskirts of the city we were able to get to the hotel from the airport and the city using public buses.  At the airport we purchased three day bus pass which included the Hop on and Hop off bus tour of the city (the green bus).  We got on the #16 bus (or the #41) which took us down Drumcronde Road and stopped at Clonliff.  From there we walked three short blocks to our hotel.  You can also pay as you go on the bus but you need to have exact change; drivers don't carry cash so you get credit in return if you don't have the correct amount.  Area was nice but we came and went during the day so ask the concierge if venturing out after dark is advisable.  The On and Off Bus tour has a free shuttle which picks up at the hotel.  If you miss the return shuttle or choose to stay down town, the public bus picks up across the street from the On and Off Bus tour.  We loved this hotel, price was right and the local was convenient to local transportation.  If you want to be in the center of the city this is not the hotel for you but if you are willing to take a bus or taxi you can be downtown in less than five minutes.",5,2012,09,20
211,Great hotel shame about the reception staff.,"I got a great deal online for a room including breakfast and the hotel should have been twice the price.
The room was large, comfortable and clean. With modern facilities, and large work desk and free wi-fi, I didnt get a room with a view, but that didnt worry me too much.
I had three breakfasts in the restautant, and a beer and snack in the bar. The club sandwich was ok, but the breakfast was a delight. Plenty of food the choose from and attentive staff to bring tea and toast and take away empty plates.
The room has an automatic charging minibar but clearly there was a problem with it, because despite taking items each day, it was not replenished during my staff and the receptionist seemed suprised when I handed her a list of items I had had over the three days, and there wasnt so much as a thank you. But this no longer suprised me. The service I recieved from reception during my staff was woeful.
Considering that this was my first trip to Dublin and Ireland, my preconceived ideas about Dublins being a friendly bunch of people, was proved wrong. At check-in I wasnt asked how my day was, what did I have planned whilst in Dublin or anything that showed the receptionist gave a damn. It wasnt until I checked out that I discovered that they had a concierge. When I did ask reception for a map, I was just handed a folded up map and the receptionist went back to talking to her colleauge. I had no idea where I was or how to get any where, with such a poor attitude I didnt waste my time asking for help.

Loved the hotel but would hesitate to go back.",3,2012,09,20
211,Fab rooms,Staff helpfull food nice location good easy walking distance .rooms decour was excellent .there is a fab Italian resturant just up form hotel on the left which is good value . Would recommend as a stop off ,4,2012,09,18
211,the last word!,"fabulous hotel! spotlessly clean, beautiful rooms, staff were friendly and attentive, couldnt fault it at all. far enough out of the centre of Dublin, but taxis are available or theres a shuttlebus that runs about every hour or so from the front door.",4,2012,09,17
211,"Thank You, Trip Advisor","We needed a 1-night stay in Dublin and the city seemed to be sold out. Trip Advisor turned up The Croke Park Hotel and we went directly to the hotel's site and grabbed a pre-paid deal for
84E/night.  We arrived the afternoon of the women's (version of lurling) tournament in the arena directly across the street from the hotel. The lobby was jammed with fans and we dreaded what the night would bring. We were pleasantly surprised!

The lobby is very sleek and layed out with little islands where one can sit and relax or go to the ""library"" (where there are no books, but very quiet). The bar was lively with fans for the tournament.

The elevators were secured by room key access only--and there was extra security in the lobby for the event.

The rooms are huge with ample closet and drawer storage. Further amenties include a large flat screen TV, CD player, coffee maker, trouser press and a large bath with tub and shower! And, the rooms are totally soundproofed to prevent any disruption from outside or in.

Breakfasts are a little expensive at 14,95 for full breakfast and 9,95 for continental, so we opted to skip and dine elsewhere. 

The location is an easy walk to O'Connell and Henry Streets and on to Temple Bar. It's close to the bus terminal and a 20E fare to the airport.

Staff is uneven--some great, others not so much.

If you can book a bargain rate--119E deal with breakfast, drink, on-off bus pass grab it!",5,2012,09,17
211,far out,"stayed for a week, enjoyed the modern lobbies and friendly staff. free wifi was fast. shower was not exactly a power-shower. while the hotel was clean and fresh and had hot water and internets, i cannot possibly understand why some ppl would refer to this place as ""luxurious"". the area around the hotel is dodgy, wouldn't walk back after dark, as advised by the concierge. cab in cab out was the thing, budget ten euros per ride to/from city.  ok for a business trip, when seeing dublin is not your priority.",3,2012,09,17
211,Beware! Unsafe area of Dublin!,"The hotel is located in NORTH Dublin, somehow a fake map locator shows them in South Dublin. The location is in a very bad run down, crime zone. You are a hostage to double fare taxi's which have agreement with hotel, or the hop-on bus which has no return service to speak of. The hallway carpets are filthy and smelly, the room was comfortable and clean. Staff is not friendly and resturant service was slow, over-priced, mediocre and with never a smile. 
Find a nice place South of Dublin where you can walk and enjoy the city, unless your company or sugar daddy is picking up the tab.
If you are a hostage at Croke Park, go out the door, turn right and at the top of the hill, past the car repair place is a fabulous Italian resturant, Wallace's, open lunch and dinner.",2,2012,09,17
211,My daughter and I had a lovely time! 15/9/12,"We flew to Dublin yesterday morning (14/9/12) to the concert at IMMA Royal Kimainham Hospital. Wow what a night! We arrived early from the airport and were told our room would not be ready till 2pm. (This was at 9.15am). We went to the dining room to purchase a breakfst and gather our thoughts together as to what we could do until our room was ready. Lo and behold! a lovely young man came to our table with keys to our room. (9.40) What joy! Our room was lovely and very well equipped. The beds were lovely and wide and so comfortable, the room was spacious, quiet and there were complimentery beverages. On our return from the wonderful Leonard Cohen concert, the receptionist at the desk booked our taxi for the morning, booked our early morning call and arranged our 'breakfast to go' as we had to leave the hotel before the dining room opened for breakfast. I would most certainly stay at this hotel again and would recommend it to others.",4,2012,09,15
211,"Great hotel, ok location, great staff, bring your own plugs!","We recently stayed two nights at the Croke Park Hotel.  We had a very enjoyable stay.  Our group had three rooms, all were different sizes and configurations.  Ours it seemed was a larger than standard room with a double bed and a single bed, which for Americans is a little odd.  The nicely outfitted, modern room and bathroom were good size, very clean and comfortable.  The view from our room wasn't impressive but that is our only negative.  Our room included breakfast was of a good variety consisting of a buffet, either a full buffet or a continental buffet.  If not included in your room, I believe the cost is either 9.95 Euro for the continental or 14.95 Euro for the full buffet.  One curiosity:  we were given milk for our coffee in the morning, when we asked for cream we were told that the Irish call milk - cream.  When we asked what the Irish call cream, the waiter said they called it actual cream.  So if you want cream for your coffee or tea, ask for actual cream!  The food at the restaurant was good and room service was good also.  We ate lunch at cozy chairs in front of a fireplace with a big screen TV on it.  The location is not near the main tourist center but they do have a shuttle that picks you up in the front of the hotel to take you to the ""hop on, hop off"" bus. I recommend this highly if you want to take in the sights of Dublin, cost is 16 Euros per person, well worth it.  We did not bring our own adapters for our phone chargers to the hotel so we had to borrow them from the hotel.  Our friends borrowed one that wasn't correct, that they used for a flat iron which promptly blew the fuse and shorted out one of their other appliances.  Perhaps you should purchase these prior to coming to Ireland, they are not expensive.  Overall this hotel is very nice and we would recommend this if you are not overly concerned about location into the main tourist area.  The concierge is very helpful and pleasant.  We enjoyed our trip to Dublin!",5,2012,09,15
211,Comfortable stay,"Staying here whilst a relative was in a nearby hospital I found everything very comfortable, for what was a stressful time. The room was excellent, with a very large comfortable bed, a sitting area, TV, desk and mini bar. There were the usual tea and coffee making facilities. The bathroom was lovely and roomy and everything was very clean. There was a large underground car park. Free computers were to be found in the reception area and breakfast was good. Reception staff were always very friendly and helpful.",4,2012,09,12
211,Excellent place to have a drink & enjoy Dublin been beaten!,"We stopped off for a drink or 2 before the MAYO -V- DUBLIN semi-final 
Excellent service, very fast, not overpriced for drink and plenty of space to sit and watch TV if you like. The place very clean.Well worth a visit.",5,2012,09,10
211,Worth it,"Good clean hotel at reasonable price. Good attention to detail. 
Located a few hundred metres to main bus service. Quiet location. Non Smoking rooms. 
Free bottles of water when leaving. 
But no pool or spa. Close to Croke Park Stadium.",4,2012,09,10
211,"Excellent value, excellent staff!","Just returned from a 3 night break at this hotel. Cannot recommend it enough and will certainly stay here when next in Dublin. Modern hotel, exceptionally clean, room was lovely, food at breakfast and evening meals superb and a special mention must go to the friendly, helpful staff. Nice touches were hot damp towels on arrival and bottled water on departure. We were meeting up with some relations on one of our nights and the staff had no problem with them using their car park free of charge which we really appreciated. About a 15minute walk gets you into O'Connell street but there is a shuttle bus service- the Dublin Bus hop on hop off. A visit to Croke Park is a must too as it's just across the road. A good hotel!",5,2012,09,09
211,"Very nice hotel, location not too bad","I was part of the wave of 30,000 Americans who descended on Dublin for the Notre Dame/Navy American football game.  The day after the ND/Navy game, the semi-finals of GAA Gaelic football was played across the street at the 80,000 capacity Croke Park (this is akin to our championship playoffs).  Under these circumstances, it might be expected that hotel service was rushed or just missing a beat.  Not so!  The hotel personnel were so helpful and generous with answers to our many, many questions and concerns.  The rooms and bathrooms are not large by American standards but are in line with European standards and very adequate.  The breakfast had a nice variety and was very fresh.  After the Croke Park game, the restaurant, bar, and courtyard were packed with many Irish fans celebrating or commiserating but when we closed the door and windows to our room, we heard nothing.  As mentioned in other reviews, the hotel is a bit out of the mainstream.  However, unless you have difficulty walking, getting down to the areas south of the river is very doable.",4,2012,09,06
211,Service is par excellence,"I stayed at this hotel twice, in 2010 and 2011, and neither time was I the least bit disappointed. I read the reviews on tripadvisor the 5 star rating is deservedly earned. On a recent business/personal trip to Ireland I left my laptop at this hotel and the staff contacted me and had it shipped to me in NYC. This was above and beyond the excellent service I received from everyone while staying at this very clean and relatively well located hotel. I would highly recommend anyone to stay here - you will not be very happy with your choice.",5,2012,09,06
211,A little bit of luxury,We went off football season and got a great deal to stay in such a beautiful hotel. Staff couldn't have been friendlier or more helpful and I thought the hotel was run overall with such Pinache. The little added extras like hand towels on arrival and a wee bottle of water when you are checking out really give this hotel an edge above the rest. ,5,2012,09,04
211,Second stay at this hotel and just as good as our first stay,"Yet again we had a very enjoyable stay. On 19th August there was a hurling match on so a lot of people were in bar, but we were surprised that the noise did not travel into the bistro next door.  We had a lovely meal in the bistro and with 2 kids, gave the bar a miss and just ordered drinks to take back to our room.  Lovely breakfast on Monday morning and staff here are very good at what they do.  Bottled water at check out is a nice touch, we have a trip to Dublin this month and another before Christmas and will be booking the Croke Park Hotel on both stays.  This hotel has friendly staff and excellent food and well worth a visit - you will return time and time again.",5,2012,09,04
211,value for money,"I booked this hotel after reading other reviews on trip advisor and was not disappointed.  We arrived at 9.00am hoping to check in early.  The rooms were not ready but we were allowed to have breakfast after which one of the rooms was ready for us.  The staff were very attentive and the rooms were really big, with lovely bathrooms and other added extras including bath robes and slippers!  All the usual facilities were available with the added bonus of the executive lounge where we could access fruit and biscuits at any time. hotel restaurant was also good value serving delicious steaks and hand cut chips! The hotel is located away from the main attractions but it is only a 20 minute walk into the centre.  However, we did use taxis late at night as we felt that this was safer than walking through the local neighbourhood.",5,2012,09,01
211,Excellent Staff,We arrived at 5:30am and were given excellent service including a room much sooner than expected and a hearty breakfast while we waited thanks to Kirya. Robert was very helpful with local information and directions and Krishna gave us an iPhone tutorial.  All in all a great welcome for tired Americans on their first visit to Ireland!,5,2012,09,01
211,Comfort and Service.,"We had a very good three nights at this first class hotel. The room was very comfortable and had everything one would expect from a hotel of this calibre.
The breakfast deserves special mention - a choice of Continental or full English (Irish?) My cholesterol level soared after tucking into the great selection on offer.
The staff were courteous, helpful and unobtrusive.
The hotel is situated right next to the Croke Park stadium and is a little distance from the city centre. However, we used the buses to get into town and after a day of sightseeing and visiting some of the many pubs, we would take a taxi back which only cost Euro 10.
We had a very pleasant stay and would recommend it without hesitation.",5,2012,08,31
211,Value for money 4* - excellent,"Perfect hotel for visiting Dublin. It's in a slightly odd part of the city (by the stadium) but it's only a 10-15 min walk to town and it's quite nice just to be a little bit out of the centre as it's nice and quiet. Hotel itself is excellently managed, polite professional staff. rooms are spot on, can't fault them. comfortable beds, fast internet, everything in the room worked as it should. had a problem with our door handle - was sorted out immediately. well managed hotel and if you can get it for around the 100euro mark then it's good value for money too. 

the only negative thing i have to say is that the location means that you probably wouldn't want to walk home in the dark as you have to go through a 50:50 area, this necessitates a taxi on the way home from town which is 10euro... although if you want this quality hotel in central dublin you'll probably have to pay twice as much for a room so it is more economical and more peaceful to be a bit further out, but that's personal choice. we had the car with us as well so having secure underground (free) car park tipped the balance for us.

very well managed hotel - keep it up!",4,2012,08,30
211,Location is not very good,"The location is not very good if you plan on visiting the City Center.  If you want to stay there for a game at Croke Park, location would be perfect.  The hotel did offer a shuttle into the city, getting back was the problem.  The walk is not that bad, but you do have to know where you are going.  We were warned to be catious while walking in the area (local gave the advice).  For the price I would have opted to stay closer to the City Center.  Overall, the hotel was very modern, breakfast fabulous, rooms spacious and staff helpful.  We were allowed to check in early without any extra fees.  

I gave it a 3 based mainly on location, othewise it earns a 5",3,2012,08,29
211,Great hotel..... However....,"We stayed here recently prior to an early sailing from Dublin port which the hotel is in close proximity to. We had a smooth check in and we were delighted with our room - clean and spacious and well appointed and a large clean bathroom. We headed to the bar for food, the main bar area was full so we were seated in a side area across the corridor. We waited and waited and eventually had our order taken and then our food arrived which was delicious and served piping hot but we constantly had to seek out staff to get service. I would have firgiven tge delays if the place had been particularly busy but this wasnt tge case. All in all our meal took nearly two hours from start to finish which for a two course meal is laughable. I decided to bring a baileys coffee upstairs as our kids were getting fractious so I asked our server for one .... Fifteen minutes later her returned and said "" no Baileys.... Sorry"" and he turned on his heel and walked off... I was dumbfounded! Breakfast the following morning was great..... A huge buffet with every option one could possibly think of!  I would recommend this hotel however I think that some of the staff just let the place down on this occasion.",5,2012,08,28
211,good hotel,"stayed at hotel for all ireland semi final. location was great ,just across the road .we arrived on sat check in was easy, we walked in to city , 10 min. room was good two double beds for 2 adults and 2kids.we dined in hotel ,it was nice but i thought a bit pricey.breakfast was good ,they dont charge for kids.car parking was free and we left car in park to 5 30 on check out day.beware on match days big delays around hotel on match day.overall very happy with our stay",4,2012,08,28
211,"Very clean hotel with attentive staff, but too far from Dublin center","Very well kept hotel with extremely helpful staff (Niamh on the front desk was lovely), but too far from attractions of Dublin. This was a last minute reservation for us and I would have preferred a hotel closer to Dublin Center, especially when traveling with 3 children. It is 10 minutes by taxi, but at 12 euros a trip, that becomes an expensive option, plus bus stop is not close, although Dublin Hop on and off stops right in front of hotel. Food in Bistro left a lot to be desired.",4,2012,08,28
211,4 star quality and a great breakfast at a reasonable price,"I have stayed at the Croke Park Hotel 20-30 times for a variety of reasons Business, family and wen I came over ro play rugby.

Location: It is 20 mins walk from from Temple bar and the centre of Dublin 5 mins in a Taxi. It is opposite Croke Park Stadium which means it gets very busy when there is a game on at the weekends. 

First impressions : Classic 4 star / 5 star hotel with all the usual amenities but not the pomp of the Westbury its sister hotel in Grafton street or the price( westbury is 50% more expensive). I have paid on average 90 euros per night with breakfast. There are pubs and restaurants nearby all of which are very good and you can walk through Dublins equivalent of China town ( Parnell Street) on the way to O'Connell and into the heart of the tourist areas .

The staff are friendly and helpful, the lounge is large  and comfortable with a restaurant off to the side and bar snacks available, the rooms are modern and comfortable with TV( irish and english channels plus skysports), bar fridge and comfy chair . The breakfast buffet in the morning is worth paying for and is substantial. There is a small gym and free parking in the underground car park.

I found the Croke Park hotel to be an excellent operating base for both business and family visits to the City.",5,2012,08,27
211,Customer service,"I stayed at this hotel with 3 children (11-13yrs) specifically for the All Ireland Semi final in Croke park. It was easy to get to the hotel and the location for us was perfect. Reception staff were pleasant and efficient. The room was great, on the 3rd floor and away from any noise (as requested). It was clean and comfortable and the heating/air conditioning worked well (I adjusted it twice.....once to turn it up and once to turn it down). It had wifi....which was a bit slow, but wasn't an important detail to us. We all had a great night sleep and were very comfortable, and there was a great choice for breakfast, from continental style fare to full Irish breakfast. The place is modern and kept clean, and does not reflect the expected level of wear and tear given the volume of people who pound through here on match days. HOWEVER we had one experience that somewhat marred our visit. Following our arrival we ate in the bar, and two of us ordered the chicken korma but requested half chips/half rice. The portion of rice that arrived was  (no exaggeration) about half a teacup of boiled rice......for both of us. I queried the portion we were to share and asked if we could have another teacup of rice.....and was bluntly told that that was the portion size (divided by two now ....as we also got a bowl of chips) and if I cared for another I'd pay for it! I registered my obvious dissatisfaction but was not going to argue with her, because it was obvious there was NO WAY the waitress was going to give us that rice. I still have not recovered from my shock really......a 54 euro meal and there was a quibble over what amounted to about 2 table spoonful's of rice each????? I also felt treated with contempt, which was worse. The food was relatively expensive for what we got. We had the hotel package that included a discount for food, but it became obvious when we were checking out  that we had (it seems) mistakenly had lunch in the wrong place......the bar rather than in the bistro. However the checkout staff gave us the discount anyway, (without me asking) which was good customer service. So overall this hotel served our needs well, and the majority of staff were pleasant. But there is a problem with customer service somewhere, when even the mildest and most courteous of complaints are dealt with with such contempt....and all for the value of a teacup worth of boiled rice.  Would I stay here again , yes but........",3,2012,08,26
211,"An excellent hotel - I can not compare to what is in city centre, but I do not feel I have missed out","Wow!  That is a long title - but it is true.  I stayed at Croke for 3 days earlier this week, and now have returned for 2 nights.  I have no complaints - both my rooms have been immaculately clean.  The staff are keen and helpful.  And, depending on your intentions, the hotel may be an excellent diversion from spending all your time in Dublin Tourist traps.... because of location I ended up doing a Tour of Croke Park - I found it so interesting, I ended up going to a Hurling match (very convenient - across the street).  My Point?  I probably would not have done this if I was in a hotel close to the Templar Bar area.. Depending on your interests, this hotel is walking distance to the Botanical Gardens, and Glancevin Cemetry (and walking distance to many other attractions, if you ealize the physical benefit to walking  45 minutes to all the downtown features).... Don't get me wrong, this hotel is not far; plus it gives you the option of experiencing the city as a true Dubliner.... 2 for 1 - what more can you ask for?",5,2012,08,23
211,Overall Great Experience,"We bought a groupon for this hotel and it was seamless. We ate at the restaurant in the morning and they had excellent fare. Convenient location, friendly stay. No free WiFi - but that is very standard for the United Kingdom. I recommend.",5,2012,08,23
211,excellent!!,"Free parking, great rooms, very clean, friendly helpful staff, breakfast as good as any 5star hotel, restaurant excellent. would definitely stay again. Bit of walk to o connell street but not that bad.",5,2012,08,23
211,Comfortable and friendly,"Stayed at the Croke Pk on an Easter getaway , first impressions were good - staff very friendly, room was clean and stylish and the bed was huge and very comfortable , decided to try the in-house restaurant and we were so impressed with the food and the service we didn't venture anywhere else in our 3 day stay( I know we could have gone out in the city centre for a meal but after a full day exploring Dublin the thought of staying  put and enjoying a great meal won out ). We had been upgraded on arrival and so could enjoy our breakfasts in the executive lounge so could wonder along to a room full of comfortable chairs , papers to read and a wonderful continental breakfast. The hotel is a good 20 min walk from O'Connell Street but we found the walk to be no problem though the surrounding areas are not the most photogenic in the city. Overall I thoroughly recommend the Croke as a great place to stay  for a few nights out of the city centre",5,2012,08,22
211,Excellent,"We have stayed at the Croke Park three times now and we did not even consider staying anywhere else on our way to the ferry after our trip to the west coast of Ireland, it is easy to find and easy to get to the ferry as well as being an excellent hotel.
The rooms are modern and clean with free wi-fi and a bathroom with bath and seperate shower, the bed is very comfortable. There is also free parking.
It is quite a way to the centre of Dublin but is easily walkable.
We have already booked to stay again in December.",5,2012,08,21
211,"Luxurious, fun with a friendly helpful staff.","This was the first hotel we stayed in during our trip to Ireland. We arrived early in the morning and were allowed to check in right away.  After traveling all night, we were happy to have access to a peaceful, quiet room. The Croke is in touch with its guest's needs.",5,2012,08,20
211,Amazing !,"For a family weekend , we decided to stay here ! The rooms were very modern , the beds were huge and very comfortable ! The bathroom was huge ! And it was a very pleasant  temp in the room ! .. Breakfast was scrumptious, with a wide variety of foods! The staff were friendly and helpful ! Just as a suggestion , I think they should add a swimming pool there , just to top off the 4 star rating of this hotel ! Just to be aware, It is a 20min walk to O'Connell St.. You would need to get a bus ! Although it is the perfect location for match or concert goers ! Overall i thoroughly enjoyed our stay and I would defiantly come back !",4,2012,08,19
211,Amazing Hotel!,"Me and my Husband were just married this past St. Patrick's Day and went to Ireland for our honeymoon. We wanted a fairly pariced nice hotel and oh boy did we get it! We spent almost 2 weeks in Dublin and at no point did we tire of our room or the hotel. We stayed in a ""Deluxe Room"" which had turn down service everynight and free breakfast every morning. The view from our room was nice, although I would have enjoyed a room looking more out towards the city. The food was AMAZING, a bit pricy but sooo worth it!! Yumm, Im drooling thinking about it! Every single staff member was friendly and helpfull. Its hard to put into words all the great things about this hotel and the environment surrounding it. I would recommend this to anyone coming eaither for play or for a romantic time!",5,2012,08,16
211,Really lovely hotel,"Stayed at The Croke Park Hotel on 6th July this year as we were up in Dublin for  a concert.  Hotel looked nice on website but from the minute we went to check in we realised that it was more than nice.  Warm face cloths to freshen up were very refreshing and a sign of things to come.  Room very nice, great comfy bed and nice power shower.  Nice seating areas in lobby for people to sit and relax.  Staff very helpful with sorting taxi and breakfast was top class the next morning.  Free car parking a big plus in Dublin and easy enough to access the hotel.  Looking forward to our next visit to Dublin and The Croke Park Hotel again.",5,2012,08,15
211,Happy customer,"We stayed here on match night, since we didn't want to drive back late.  I found the staff very friendly, the food was good, and the piece de resistance - the best night's sleep I have had in a long time. Thank you. We'll certainly be back.",5,2012,08,15
211,Superb!,"Great place, friendly, relaxed , very well run, a home from home! The proximity from city centre and the stadium are also great pluses. The rooms are spacious , comfortable with all mod cons.Some added courtesies include the bicycle hire facility and the manners of everyone of the staff. Obviously someone is taking a lot of care.",5,2012,08,14
211,Excellent Hotel,Stayed here for a hurling match at the weekend and must say the hotel was fab. The rooms were great and the location perfect.Great selection for breakfast.Staff very helpful Hope to return again soon.,5,2012,08,14
211,Beautiful hotel and great service,"We only stayed one night but had a really warm, friendly reception and was so grateful for the hot chocolate (freezing snow outside) on arrival. Huge, comfortable bed and lovely homely room with a bath (amazing). Would go back 100%.",5,2012,08,12
211,Excellent Hotel,"Just home from a night in The Croke Park hotel, my husband, three children and I stayed there before the All-Ireland Semi Final today.  The staff are most helpful and the rooms are fabulous!  We had dinner in the bar and it was delicious! Even on match day when it was hectic in there the staff were more then helpful, I cannot recommend this hotel enough.  We will def back for the All-Ireland Final (if we get tickets!!)",5,2012,08,12
211,Lovely Staff,"I stayed for three nights in May 2012. The service was excellent, the staff really did bend over backwards to make sure I had a good stay. The food was good but the price was a little steep. The room was very clean, however, I expected it to have a little more floor space. My only issue is the location, the hotel is so lovely but the surrounding area wasn't so nice.",5,2012,08,12
211,Great Hotel...A little way from the city center...,"I really enjoyed our stay at this hotel.  They were polite, attentive to our requests, and the food was decent.  My only complaint is that you have to take a cab to get to the city center; which isn't a big deal (it's only 5 min and 10EUR).  Aside from that, it's great.",4,2012,08,11
211,Great hotel & value,"The Croke Park hotel was great value and the hotel and rooms are beautiful.
We will definatly return. We had friends visit from abroad and checked all over Dublin for a good value hotel and this is really worth a try. The staff are very pleasant , and good parking available. We could just leave the car the whole time in the hotel and in 20 minutes walk we were in the city centre.",5,2012,08,11
211,What a wonderful Hotel,We stayed in Croke Park Hotel last week with children and we cant wait to go back again. From start to finish it was just fantastic. The breakfast was just outstanding. When the children were asked did they want Hot Chocolate they were so happy. The variety for breakfast was amazing. Well done to the management and staff. We will be back !! Hotel was spotless.,5,2012,08,11
211,The perfect hotel for a stay in Dublin,"In June this year myself and my boyfriend visited the hotel for five nights. We picked up a taxi from outside the airport to get to the hotel which was around 20euros. We arrived before check in at the hotel however within only an hour of waiting, in the very welcoming bar, our room was ready for us. Our room was very spacious and the bathroom was lovely with both bath and shower! The maids came in everyday and always left the room looking spotless. We only ate in the bar due to being on a budget. The food was lovely and quite reasonable at around 10euros for a meal. The staff in the bar, and in the rest of the hotel, were always friendly and ready to help. There is also a gym in the hotel which I used once, there is not many machine's in there, but its ok for a quick work out. 
The hotel is around about a 10-15min walk from O'Connell street. Only a five min walk away is a bus that will take you to O'connel street for about a euro if you don't fancy the walk. In the evening we did get a taxi back from Temple bar which I would advise due to the walk back to the hotel not being in the nicest of areas (felt completely safe in the day though). The taxi was around 15euros.
We also bought the hop on hop off bus tickets from the hotel for around 18euros for 48hours (they're a few euros cheaper buying them from the hotel) The bus was completely worth it, it goes to all the tourist attractions and also has live commentary so you can hear all about the history of Dublin.
All in all our stay The Croke Park hotel was brilliant and the next time we're in Dublin we will be staying there again!",4,2012,08,10
211,Really enjoyed it,Really Enjoyed My stay here i was with my girlfiend who is a celiac and she was delighted with the gluten free dishes available on the menu.The staff were amazing and very helpful.Breakfast was great and there was a nice buzz around the place for the dublin game across the road.Will be back !!,5,2012,08,08
211,Top Class Hotel Stay,"Stayed here for a weekend with a friend to celebrate a birthday and go to a concert. We didn't avail of a concert package but nonetheless we had a fantastic stay. We had a meal in the bar on arrival which was excellent and staff were full of ideas for the perfect night out. The room was fabulous, very spacious with two double beds. Breakfast was substantial with all the usual varied selection on offer. Any time we approached reception with a query even if staff were busy another staff member appeared from behind the scenes immediately (it felt as if by magic!). Staff couldn't do enough to ensure the perfect stay and attention to detail was something else, ice dispensers on every floor, takeaway & DVD ordering service & they even provide popcorn for family nights in as well as bottles of water on check out. Hotel is situated fairly close to the city centre and easily and cheaply accessed by taxi or on foot. Surrounding area itself isn't exactly the best and we were advised by other guests not to venture too far in the nearby vicinity of the hotel",5,2012,08,07
211,Solid hotel but a bit clinical,"I stayed in this hotel after attending football in Croke Park.  As a location for ""Croker"", its location is ideal. However, it isn't ideal for most other things in Dublin. The building is far from aestethically pleasing, bith inside and out. The rooms are of very good standard with very comfortable beds. The breakfast is also fantastic. Yet, despite being right beside Croker, it lacks a bit of character,",4,2012,08,06
211,Just right!,"The service in this hotel was second to none especially in the bar during lunch the waitress was only too eager to please. The rooms were great. Huge king size bed. Bathroom spotless with bath and huge shower. The only problem was some lights didn't work and the TV was a disaster but I think the batteries in the remote were almost dead! Also the location is a bit annoying but it is only abou 7-10 euro into the centre and the area it is in is perfect if you are there for a match as you are literally at the front door of croke park. The area around the hotel seemed a bit rough around the edges but we got taxis everywhere so didn't really effect us.
Overall a very luxiourios stay for a budget price. I will be back!",4,2012,08,05
211,Nice Place to Stay even with a Football Game next door,"We stayed here our last night in Ireland before heading out to the airport the next morning.  There was a football game going on when we arrived and as the game ended the folks flooded the bar and there was a lot going on in the area.  It actually made for an interesting time as I was able to walk over into the stadium store and mingle with all of the folks leaving the game.  The bar actually did a good job setting up additional stations and serving folks so we were able to get drinks relatively quickly even with the crowds.

The hotel itself was a very nice place to stay.  The room was clean with a nice size bathroom and was good sized overall.  Check-in was easy and the porter was prompt with our bags.  We went out for a farwell dinner but when we got back the bar was back to normal and we had a good large area for our group to gather and have a final evening together.  Out beds were very comfortable and we both slept well.  Out flight was very early the next morning and the staff provided us with a bag breakfast as the normal venue was not open that early in the morning (around 4 when we had to leave).  Check-out was easy and efficient and traffic was not bad at all to the airport at this time in the morning.  

Very enjoyable stay and would have enjoyed staying longer.",5,2012,08,04
211,Ideal location for our stay,"My daughter and I stayed here for 3 nights recently while a close relative recovered from surgery in the Mater Hospital which is 4 to 5 minute drive or 15 minute walk. The hotel was ideal for our stay, very friendl and helpful staff, spotless rooms and great food. Couldn't fault this hotel. ",5,2012,08,04
211,"Great hotel, but location not so much","Stayed here for an extended weekend in June and had a very nice first visit to Ireland. We upgraded for a small additional fee to the executive floor which included breakfast and access to the executive lounge.

Pros:
Great rooms, fantastic bathrooms
A very nice executive lounge with free coffee, hot chocolate and fruits all day
Ok breakfast, though missed bacon & eggs or anything else ""warm""
Dublin sightseeing bus tickets for sale in the lobby and the bus picks people up hourly, loved the live tours
Great service

Cons:
Location, a 15 minute walk from downtown through some rather boring parts of Dublin (though right next door to Croke Park stadium if that interests you)
Kids in the executive lounge; doesn't feel all that exclusive when there suddenly are screaming small children in it....

As a hotel, I definitely recommend it, they've done everything right, I'd say it's damned near close to perfect. Unfortunately the location left a bit to be desired for me (despite the hourly tour buses) so I think I might try a hotel closer to the Liffey next time, maybe in the Temple Bar area.",4,2012,08,04
211,What a great find!,"We stayed here as a family of four. From check-in with the really helpful staff handing us a map of Dublin and drawing directions to her recommended Chinese Buffet restaurant (and it was good) to the bar staff bringing us chairs from around the lounge to let us all sit around a table, the whole experience was great. Rooms were high quality, spacious and spotlessly clean. Even parking was free, the reception member spotted us hovering and quickly stamped our tickets to let us in and out of the car park.
As we had a car, we were OK to go into Dublin, without a car I'd be unsure about the surrounding area and it would probably need a taxi to get into the action. Also, our room for four had two double beds, the children don't sleep well in a double together, but reception told us a Z bed could have been installed.
We'll definitely stay here again!",5,2012,08,03
211,Fabulous hotel... Will be back.,"Booked the hotel for 2 nights and we were not disappointed. The staff here are excellent, really good at their job and genuinely interested in you. We couldn't say enough about the staff and the hot towels on arrival were a fantastic touch. The food was great value, lovely to eat and even had gluten free options!!! Yes more than one option. Rooms were very spacious, clean and tidy. Great layout to the room. ",5,2012,08,03
211,Great hotel close by the GAA stadium (not near town center),"We just concluded a weeklong family vacation at the Croke Park Hotel and enjoyed it very much.  The surroundings were quiet as there were no games at the stadium (just across the street) and the staff was VERY friendly.  The room was clean, the bathroom was spacious and the bed was comfortable.  Food in the Sideline Bar was great as well!  If you stay here you will not be disappointed.",4,2012,08,03
211,"Excellent 4*Hotel, a bit out of the Centre of Town","We were very happy with this choice. This hotel is excellent value for a good business/city break hotel, that is not to say it not stylish, it is just neither boutique nor vintage. Rooms were big and very clean, beds comfortable and the bath was great. A lot of space for everything you might need. Big LED flatscreen with a lot of channels, free and fast WiFi in the room, a nice fitness centre and free parking really come in handy. The staff is very cordial and professional, the only downside is its circuitous location. It is a five minutes walk to the bus s tation and than a 10 - 20 minutes ride to town, on the other hand, the #16 bus there take you right to the airport. All in all I would highly recommend, if you don't mind walking or taking a bus riding to the city centre!!",5,2012,08,02
211,Great stay,"I stayed there with a colleague recently and enjoyed the location. 

Free parking and wi-fi are always welcomed. 
the room was fine and as expected. the aircon did dry me out - but was better when i turned it down. 

Breakfast was ok

the hotel is close enough to have a long walk / short taxi into town

easy to park there. which is a welcome change for Dublin",4,2012,08,01
211,Excellent hotel with great staff who really make an effort.,Great hotel and wonderful facilities. The staff are wonderful and they really go the extra mile to ensure that everyone is well looked after. We were in Dublin with a sick relative and they really made our stay more comfortable any way they could.,5,2012,07,30
211,Dublins little gem :),"We stayed in the Croke park hotel for 3 nights, the hotel is only a 15 min walk from city centre and situated in a tranquil part of the city, the pictures were exactly as shown on the internet. The hotel is very clean and the rooms very spacious and also free car park for your stay, staff were also very friendly and helpful. There was also a hop on hop off bus service outside the hotel. The only disadvantage of the hotel is theres no bar entertainment for guests if you have a few drinks there otherwise great hotel :)",5,2012,07,30
211,Fab hotel 4star plus,"Had to go to Dublin unexpectedly for a family funeral and this hotel was highly recommended to me but did not know what to expect but it was a good location for me.  
THIS HOTEL IS A MUST - Clean modern bright with top class facilities in the large and well presented and very clean bedrooms. Fridge,safe, tv, music system, wine glasses and ice bucket, tea/coffee and herbal teas.trouser press and iron and iron board along with seperate bath and large shower and lots of toiletries..(only one toilet roll though. should be two ).
Staff are very nice and so helpful - nothing is too much trouble. Thanks esp to Amanda and Assus on reception for all their help.  Room rate is great for this fabulous hotel.  
Will definately be back many times I hope.",5,2012,07,28
211,good value,"Lovely hotel. We found it very difficult to get a family room for 2 adults and 3 kids in Dublin. This was perfect with lovely big family rooms, 2 double beds and one single. Room was very spacious and clean.",4,2012,07,27
211,An Excellent Hotel,"Booked this one last minute - in a rush, on Hotels.com. I had no idea if it would be any good or not, and on arrival the situation did not seem particularly nice???
However,, once inside it became immediately apparent just how good it was going to be. A truly exceptional stay in probably the cleanest hotel room I have seen. Staff for whom nothing was too much trouble gave perfect service. A good bar and excellent breakfast too.
Located close to the centre of Dublin you are a cheap taxi ride away from most places you want to be.
Truly good value and well worth staying. You won`t be disappointed,",5,2012,07,27
211,Great Hotel but a lousy location for touring Dublin,"The rooms are great.  The facilities are fine.  The food is great (try the Ox Tails --- they take the meat off the bone for you --- all the work is done --- just eat and enjoy.  Oh yes, substitute Colcannon for the potatoes on the menu.--- best I've had since grandma passed away 45 years ago).
Word of warning --- the map that I used to schedule the hotel seemed to indicate it was ""downtown"" --- it is a cab ride to get to Temple Bar, etc.  If you are going to a game or a concert at Croke Park by all means stay here.  You'll have a GREAT time.  The Pub is well stocked.",4,2012,07,27
211,Excellent value/exceeded expectations,"We spent two nights at the Croke Park Hotel on the way home from a cruise.  Overall, this is an excellent upper middle quality hotel.  The rooms (we had 2) were very clean, well appointed and spacious for Europe.  The staff were curtious and helpful.  The location is about a 15 minute walk from the center of town (20 minutes to Trinity College).  The price was very competitive except that we felt that the full breakfast, while very good, was overpriced at 15 Euro.  We would definitely recommend this hotel.",4,2012,07,25
211,30th.wedding anniversary. jim linda speirs,"last minute booking this hotel and was not disappointed,was a bit worried about location, but after a 3 night stay we were glad it was a little bit out, as i can imagine in town a bit noisy at night.
our room was on 4th.floor superior rooms and were very impressed with size and layout,and little
extras like bathrobes,slippers,etc. we were in our room 10mins. when room service arrived with
champagne and strawberries, we did mention at desk it was first time in dublin and it was our
anniversary. so it was a nice touch from reception staff who are very welcoming as are all the staff who make this a lovely stay.never ate at hotel as we were out most of the time,but the prices
we paid outside for food and drink are on comparison with hotel, had a few guiness at bar,and wife gin and tonics about same price as good bars in town,would return again in a heartbeat.",5,2012,07,23
211,A good and impressive hotel !,"Before we flew back to our home country, we stayed the last night in Ireland at this hotel   This hotel is not centrally located in Dublin town centre, but just opposite to the Croke Park Stadium. It is only around 10 minutes driving distance from the city.   From the outlook and the surrounding buildings of this hotel, it is definitely not a new hotel but believe that it has been newly refurbished.   Rooms are big enough with empty spaces, fitted with modern furniture and decoration, which will make you feel quite comfortable inside.   Bathroom is clean and has separate shower and bathtub area.   Free Wi-Fi is provided in the rooms. Reception staff are very friendly and helpful.  
All in all, this is a good hotel   Would like to recommend it to everyone.",4,2012,07,22
211,Not in the city but otherwise above expectations,"Spent 3 nights at this fairly new hotel.

Modern looking large room, good firm beds and cleaner than the average hotel room. Bathroom has separate shower and bathtub area. Free wireless internet. Basically a place where most travellers will feel at home away from home.

Had room service and dinner in the restaurant. In both cases the food was quite good. Breakfast just a nudge above what is usually encountered incl. free local newspaper. I want to especially praise the staff of the restaurant: very professional and very friendly. 

This hotel is a good choice for people who have a car as free parking is offered. 

Some reviewers complain that the hotel is not in the center of Dublin. True, but that can hardly come as a surprise. I dont really see the problem as the city is just 7-8 minutes away on bus no. 7 which departs less than five minutes walk from the hotel. Cost: 0.60 EUR per person.",5,2012,07,21
211,IMPRESSIVE,"Stayed at this hotel for 3 nights on bed and breakfast basis.
Got a lovely surprise from hotel as there was balloons and banners up for our arrival as we had a celebration there. Also there was two bottles of Champagne chilling in a bucket of ice too! Lovely touch! No 16 bus from airport takes you to a five min walk from hotel. Ask driver to let you off at Quinns Pub. 
Hotel is immuaculate and the rooms are too. Spacious bedroom with two double beds, free wifi, bathroom with double shower unit and separate bath and toiletries. 
Food was lovely and staff were very polite.
Free use of two computers in reception next to a very equipped gym.
We travelled with two children and we walked daily to town - including guiness factory and back!  No hills and lots to see. The 2 day bus pass is expensive and unless your going to do all the sights then walking is fine with sensible shoes! Print your guiness factory tickets online in advance and save yourself 10%!
I would return to this hotel and would recommend it to anyone!  Worth every penny! Booked through Alpharooms - cheapest I could find!",5,2012,07,21
211,Great big rooms,We checked in to the hotel after a hurling match and it was a great location. We had 2 double beds in our room and there was still room for a cot. Breakfast was lovely and plentiful with a great selection. Only problem was we could not drive into the hotel as the road was blocked off due to the match. We will be back ,5,2012,07,20
211,Sound proofing would have helped,"I needed accommodation the night before an exam. The room was pleasant and had everything except a bath - so why provide bath gel?! Normally a shower is fine but having taken part in a 19 mile power walk 2 days before I was really looking forward to soaking my aches away. The shower had a poor flow, in fact the next night I stayed at a hostel where the shower was excellent, 10x the water flow.
I also needed relative quiet so I could plod on with revising; at one point it sounded like a herd of elephants galloping across the ceiling and later the man next door banged against the wall and I thought he was going to come through it.
Next morning there was loud music coming from the direction of the stadium which is situated directly opposite the hotel. The breakfast was pleasant but I guess not many guests eat the black or white pudding - somewhat dried up.
The staff I met were all pleasant. 
Not a hotel I will rush back to.",3,2012,07,19
211,ENJOYABLE STAY,"My husband and I stayed here for 1 night on a bus tour of Ireland.  This is a very modern hotel, well appointed and spotlessly clean.Very hot and heavy doona.  It is well situated for sport fans.  The breakfast was good.  Would recommend.",4,2012,07,19
211,Great Hotel & Service,"My husband and I spent a few nights at the Croke Park Hotel and really loved it. The rooms were modern,spacious and very clean. The staff was really great especially the concierge Stephen who went out of his way to help us with travel directions and even a hair straightener for me! He was awesome.",5,2012,07,18
211,A Super Place to Stay,"I don't normally stay in the Croke Park when visiting Dublin, but due to lack of alternatives on a recent trip I ended up there for one night.

What a super hotel! Smart, comfortable, friendly, efficient. Great facilities for the price I paid.

The only reason I wouldn't make it my regular hotel when traveling on business is that I prefer a city centre hotels - having pubs and restaurants around for the evening - while Croke Park looks like half an hour's walk or a short taxi ride away (there are probably buses - I didn't ask - in the end I ate the excellent bar food). But it would make a super base if you were there for sport - and a great location if you prefer something a little quieter out side of the city centre.",5,2012,07,18
211,Always enjoyable,"We've stayed here many times. It's a great hotel, very modern but really comfortable and warm. The food is lovely, we always enjoy breakfast. The hotel is a little away from the city centre, but there is a busstop a 5minute walk away which will leave you on O'Connell St. Beside this busstop there are some shops/pubs/restaurants and take-aways. This area is called Drumcondra and is a fairly nice part of the city so would be safe at night. Taxi would probably be about €8-€10 depending on where in the city you're going. Free parking and very quiet hotel ( except on match days!!) :-) For the price, you will struggle to find a nicer hotel - being outside the city centre is the sacrifice!",5,2012,07,17
211,Dublin hotel,"Service was excellent in this hotel.  The room was spotlessly clean, beds very comfortable and is in a quiet location and yet within a 20 minute walking distance from Dublin city.
Breakfast area was very crowded but good quality food items.",5,2012,07,16
211,"Excellent Hotel, not central","We were only staying one night before travelling to the country for a family party so the location was not a problem for us and certainly wouldn't be for anyone going to a match at Croke Park.  The hotel itself was very good, very nice public areas and extremely helpful staff.  The bedrooms were standard business level but a notch nicer than necessary.  Mind you, we were on the ""executive"" floor which made a difference with access to an executive lounge with free drinks and snacks, nice bath robes etc.  The breakfast was fine, nothing exciting but more than adequate.  It would be possible to take a walk into the centre of Dublin but the weather was not up to it during our visit, taxis were quite expensive but acceptable and the taxi drivers were very friendly.",5,2012,07,16
211,Great hotel a wee bit out of city center,"We stayed at Croke Park on July 12th and we will be back the night before we fly home
Pros
Immaculent, cleanest hotel I have ever been in
Love the free parking on the Airport side of the city; about 15 minutes
Free breakfast-fantastic-long hours 6,30 to 10
Fantastic staff

Cons
about 15 minutes to City Center; longer to Temple Bar: really long with jet lag. The Ho Ho make a couple of stops back but we missed them. We are walkers but I can see this as a problem if you are disabled or have terrible rainy weather
You have to use your key card to run the elevator and turn on the lights-bit of a pain, not sure if this is a European thing. But I guess it is good for security and conservation

Other than that if you don't mind walking; I would highly recommend",5,2012,07,16
211,"Great Hotel, friendly staff","We are just back from Dublin and have stayed in the 'Best Hotel in Dublin'... The rooms are spacious, the beds are really comfortable and the food is delicious and reasonably priced. The staff are so friendly and helpful. The free car parking on site is a real bonus. I cant wait to go back to Dublin as I will hopefully be staying here again. It is a wee bit out of town but it wouldn't put me off staying here again. So book now you won't be disappointed.",5,2012,07,14
211,Genuine Hospitality in Dublin!,"On a trip that started badly, the staff and facilities of the Croke Park Hotel made all the difference between having a bad holiday and a restful one.
Susana, Krishna, Ciara, Fabiana, Sandeep... these are some of the wonderful people at the Croke Park. Krishna, the concierge, has bent over backwards to make our stay pleasant and carefree; Susana welcomes up to breakfast cheerily every morning; Ciara gives us the highest attention at reception. Housekeeping is impeccable: they leave my room fragrant and spotless every day.

The Croke Park Hotel is a 10-15 minute walk from the City Centre. It is accross Croke Park, a GAA stadium, an attraction itself. It has a restaurant and bar with delicious food priced reasonably for European standards. The staff at the Executive Lounge (Susana) with its complimentary continental breakfast make us feel as VIPs every morning. 

I highly recommend Croke Park to anyone contemplating a trip to Dublin. It is a ray of warmth and sunshine, even in the almost constant rainy days that we experienced. The choice of hotel rescued what could have been a so-so vacation.",5,2012,07,13
211,"Croke Park Hotel, Dublin","Stayed here recently with 3 friends after Westlifes final show. Had a great stay. Very comfortable beds, friendly staff, quick check in & out, taxi outside waiting the next morning to bring us straight to Breaffy. Definitely the only place to stay if going to a gig in Croke Park.",5,2012,07,11
211,Weekend trip,Every time I come to Dublin this is where I stay. A fantastic hotel with the nicest and most helpful staff. I recommend it to everyone who is going to Dublin,5,2012,07,11
211,Best hotel in Dublin,"Not only was this the best hotel in Dublin, but I would rate it as the best in Ireland. The rooms were cheaper and far more comfortable than most of the hotels I have stayed in. For a start there was AIRCONDITIONING, very unusual for Ireland. The shower was large and there was space to put your toiletries in the bathroom, another unusual occurence. We arrived just as the Olympic torch was about to leave from Croke Park Stadium, across the road. Check in was a breeze, even though it was 10am and normally check in is 3pm! So we were able to drop cases and get back outside to get great pics. All of the staff were friendly and very obliging. The bar and the food we all had was good and plentiful, there was 5 of us. Even though we got a little noisy in the bar it wasn't a problem (were not hoons or teenagers by the way), just catching up after 10 years.",5,2012,07,10
211,"Nice, Modern Hotel.  Average Location.","I hate to start a review with great value as that can cause concern about whether it is nice or not.  The Croke Park Hotel is indeed nice.  It is modern and clean.  The staff is helpful and the rooms are comfortable.  I requested and got a King bed which is hard to do.  The only downside is the walk to town.  This hotel is across the street from a sports stadium, but it is a walk to OConnor street and then down to the action in Dublin.  Still you can't beat the price.  Hence that is why it is great value.  If this hotel was moved to downtown it would be three times the price.  So well worth the walk, which is safe and flat.  Parking is free.  Cabs are not recommended as too expensive.  Breakfast is better gotten in town.  All in all, I would stay here again.",4,2012,07,10
211,pleasantly surprised,We are regular visitors to Dublin and can honestly say that (with a few exceptions) we have never been impressed with any of the hotels.  that is until now - the Croke Park Hotel - ...... From the minute we arrived the staff couldnt do enough for us.  The rooms are very clean and the beds are SO comfortable - after a day of sightseeing or shopping just whats needed. The only drawback I can see here is being so close to Croke Park - so not recommended when there are events/matches on - otherwise its a great spot.,5,2012,07,10
211,An Excellent Hotel with Exceptional Value for the Money,"Being that it's my seventh trip to the Dublin area in just less then three years, I must say that I'm pretty much a regular here. However, when I decided to come to Dublin for two weeks in high season and I couldn't locate a room at the Dylan (a posh little five star boutique hotel in the upscale Dublin 4 area of the city), I was quite disappointed. 

I searched through the reviews for quite a while as I think I became a creature of habit, booking the Dylan Hotel each time and being able to get a room there without having to switch from hotel to hotel based on full occupancy (something I hadn't yet experienced in Dublin). 

I read some negative reviews about the distance to the city centre and the area that it's located in and I have to dispel these right away. First off, the hotel is not located in a bad area, however it is about a 15 or 20 minute walk to the city centre. However, a taxi to O'Connell Street costs between 7 and 8 euros depending on the route the driver takes. Additionally, there's a Hop on Hop off bus which comes directly to the hotel every 30 minutes or so which also goes to the city centre. You could simply buy a two day pass on the hop on hop off and that should get you back and forth fairly easily depending on the hour of day you're going to and fro. 

I booked my reservation through Orbitz for the first week (I'm still at the hotel and just booked in the second week as I had to see for myself how I felt about the hotel when I arrived) for a Superior Room and was pleasantly surprised when I arrived and was upgraded to a Deluxe Room on the 4th Floor (the top floor of the hotel) with unlimited access to the Executive Lounge. The Executive Lounge is such a great perk as they serve a light buffet style breakfast (free of charge of course to those who have access to it) from 6:30am - 9:30am. Additionally, the Executive Lounge has unlimited coffee, tea, orange juice, milk, and bottled water throughout the day. In the evening there are pre-dinner cocktails. 

While I'm used to staying in 5 star hotels, I must say that the deluxe room that I was given is an exceptional value for the money. The wifi throughout the hotel and the rooms are free and the signal is strong and fast (something I was concerned about prior to my arrival as I need fast Internet for work).

The food in the Sideline Bistro is terrific. The drinks are inexpensive and overall the hotel is a great value. Definitely very happy about my decision.",5,2012,07,09
211,Lovely hotel but food and drink is very over priced,"Lovely hotel, excellent if you are attending an event at Croke Park. Bed are extremely comfortable and the rooms are clean. 

Only down side is the price of food and drink.",4,2012,07,09
211,Great hotel in so many ways.,"Was really impressed with this city centre hotel. The staff were very friendly, complimentary car parking, iPad docking station, free high speed WiFi, huge powerful shower, fantastic breakfast and the location, Couldn't get any closer to the almighty Croke Park Stadium. If only there had of been a Springsteen concert on...",5,2012,07,07
211,Great Hotel just outside Dublin City Centre,"The Croke Park hotel is a very nice place to stay. The rooms are spacious and modern and the Wi-Fi works really well. The hotel provides underground parking that is free for guests (with a quick validation from the front desk). My wife and I really enjoyed our stay because of the little touches the hotel does, like the business center with free printing, and a lovely restaurant for breakfast. The staff was very friendly and professional. 

The only drawback is that this hotel is just on the outskirts of the main touristy areas. I can only speak from personal experience, and I will admit that my sense of direction isn't the best, even at the best of times :), but we couldn't do the walk from the hotel into the Temple Bar area in anything less than 30 minutes. Also, we got to talking with a taxi driver and he advised us not to do much walking around the area late at night because it is in kind of a sketchy part of the city. If you have a rental car though, this hotel is perfect. Parking is abundant in Dublin for about €12 (taxi ends up being about €15 for a one-way trip) for a full day so even factoring that in, it is still much more reasonably priced than anything we found in City Centre. 

We completely recommend this hotel, and I would definitely stay there again, but if you don't have a car, the walk or taxi rides into the city can add up quick.",4,2012,07,04
211,Great Hotel!,"The hotel is very clean, the rooms are spacious and the staff is very friendly and helpful. Compared to the rest of the hotels I have stayed in Europe, this one was very special (in a good way!). There is a coffee maker in the room, the WiFi actually worked very well, and the hotel appeared modern and up to date. When our taxi didn't show up at the hotel door, they actually arranged a hotel shuttle to take us to our destination, which was just 7 min away. That was a very nice gesture. Breakfast was great. The location was not ideal for me, as the hotel is not very close to the city center (and temple bar), and you have to walk at least 20-25 min to get there, but the hotel facility by itself is really great. I would definitely stay there again....",5,2012,07,04
211,Wonderful Hotel,"Stayed for a weekend, it's definitely one of the nicest hotels I've been to! The staff were lovely, except we found the bar staff to be a bit rude. We stayed on the executive floor and it was really worth the money. They have lots of nice little touches like a chocolate beside your bed after the turndown service come. The executive lounge was also really nice and always quiet. We were always able to go in to make some tea or coffee or take some fruit etc if we wanted to. The beds were very comfy and spacious. The room was spotlessly clean and we really liked the tv and the cd player and all the extras that were there. The shower didn't really get that hot which was one of the only bad things. They had some nice complimentary toiletries in the bathroom - shampoo, shower gel, soap, shower cap, body lotion, a small kit with cotton wool and then some thread for fixing your clothes, really the usual things you would find. Something we did notice was that we could hear a lot of what was going on outside the door and sometimes it was quite loud, but this was just people coming and going during the day and at night it was fine. Would really like to stay here again!",5,2012,07,03
211,Classy,"This is a very nice hotel. Right across the street (literally) from Croke Park stadium, this hotel has it's own parking garage that is free for guests. It's in a great North Dublin location that my girlfriend and I were able to walk downtown from with ease.

The room was very clean and comfortable and modern too. The restaurant and bar staff were extremely friendly and provided excellent service. The complimentary breakfast was one of the best I've ever had, and it's not your typical cereal, bagel and fruit juice breakfast. This is a meat party baby, and you're invited.

Overall this is a top notch hotel. I will absolutely stay here again the next time I visit Dublin.",5,2012,07,03
211,Nice and clean,"Stayed one night, no breakfast included, 10 min walking to center, 10 min drive to airport.",4,2012,07,02
211,"Exceeded my expectations, wonderful staff","Bedrooms and Bathrooms are a good size with separate bath and shower.  Hotel is spotlessly clean throughout.  Staff are exceptionally friendly, helpful and welcoming.  Nice touches like heated hand towels at check in, bottled water on departure.  Free car park, also extremely well maintained and spacious.  We used it as our base for visiting the zoo and city centre, taxis readily available.  The Croke Park Hotel exceeded my expectations.",4,2012,07,02
211,"great hotel, bad location","I visited this hotel in June for a weekend stay & the hotel itself was absolutely lovely. The reception area was extremely pretty & the rooms were spacious, clean and very comfortable. In addition the bar was great with friendly staff & lots of drink choices. We also got the morning breakfasts which could not have been better. The only reason I would not visit this hotel again is due to its location as it’s not close to Dublin city centre. Because the weather was not nice we were forced to get taxis everywhere which obviously ate into our budget. I honestly can’t fault the hotel itself but the next time I visit Dublin I’ll be staying somewhere closer to Dublin city centre in order save money.",3,2012,07,02
211,"Good Hotel, handy for the Stadium..... it's across the road !","We only stayed one night and chose it for being handy for Dublin Port which it was.
It is a modern hotel and part of a hotel group so it works well.
It met all our requirements from modern,clean,well appointed comfortable room to secure  free  basement parking ( 2mtrs). We only had breakfast which was good.
The hotel is situated right across the road from the Croke Park Stadium and it would be best to enquire when booking, that there isn't a match on or otherwise it could get compromised.",4,2012,07,02
211,"Top class hotel, worth the walk...","Really enjoyed three nights at this hotel on visiting Dublin. Top class, friendly service from check-in to checkout. Huge bathrooms were a real bonus with separate shower and bath. Didn't eat at the hotel but in some ways regret that since prices in Temple Bar, even for breakfast in a Cafe, were at least as high as the hotel, which is unusual.

Would definitely stay here again. Dublin has a charm, but it's real life and some real poverty. Temple Bar has its charm too but it's in danger of becoming an overpriced Disney caricature of itself. There is more to Dublin and it was nice to get back to a nice balance at the hotel at night.

Slainte.",4,2012,06,30
211,"Clean, quiet, lots of amnenities (or however its spelled)","We really enjoyed this hotel.  We showed up early and they were willing to hold our bags until our room was ready.  The lobby is OK...not great but certainly not bad.  It is at least a 15 min walk to get to downtown Dublin.  

The rooms were very nice.  Large bathroom with a great walk-in shower and a separate tub.  Lots room on the bathroom shelf.  The room had lots of closet and drawer space.  The wifi was free and worked well, and everything was very clean both in our room and the hotel in general.

They sell tickets for the Hop On Hop Off bus at the front desk and a shuttle comes by a few times a day to take you to that bus.  The have free and ample parking in a garage.  We were NOT there during an event at the stadium so that may be different then.

I have read some criticisms of the neighborhood.  I don't think they are justifiable.  The surrounding area is largely residential...some of it for college kids.  That makes it appear unsafe at night, but I don't see it as unsafe.  If you go north of the hotel, you will hit a busy street ((Lower Drumcondra Road) filled with lots of restaurants, and eventually nice homes in nice neighborhoods.  We found a great place for breakfast, lunch and dinner about 10-15 minutes walk in this directions (Andersons Cafe and Creperie).  Take a walk to the free National Botanical Gardens from the hotel (~20-30 min) and you will walk through nice neighborhoods.

Our only criticism of this hotel was that the cable TV channels were very limited.  We weren't' there to watch TV but at the end of the day when you want to wind down, turning on the TV helps, and there wasn't much to watch on the limited channels.

Overall, a great place to stay...I'd go back.",4,2012,06,28
211,Great location next to Stadium,"If you are going to Croke Park this place cannot be beaten for location. It is right outside the entrance of the Hogan stand. We went to a concert in Croke Park and were back having a drink at the bar 5 minutes after the concert ended.

It is a new Hotel and there are no issues with noise even after a concert. That was something that we were concerned about but it was great, we got a good night’s sleep. Rooms and bathrooms were nice and spotlessly clean.

Breakfast was good, with the exception of the black and white pudding, they were like mini circular bricks.

We ate in the restaurant at lunch and for an evening meal.  It was good but not great.  Typically of hotel food, the menu descriptions promised a lot but the actual meal was disappointing. An example is the seafood chowder at lunch – it looked nice and was described nicely but it was a bit gloopy, not rich and creamy as I would have expected.  

Nice friendly staff and good service throughout.

They did ratchet up the price of the rooms on concert night but I suppose that is to be expected.",4,2012,06,28
211,Excellent hotel,"Just back from a 3 night stay at this hotel & we would definitely stay there again.  The staff were very helpful and nothing was too much trouble, we had cause to report the sink plug being stuck which was sorted within our return.  The room was cleaned, tea making replenished, bed changed & made each day, to the exact standard we found the room in when we first arrived.  We also checked in early, which was no problem, reception staff were always friendly and helpful. 

  I have read reviews about the hotel not being sound proof but we didn't experience this at all - there was a concert in Croke Park, which is opposite, and we didn't hear a sound from our room, which was at the back of the hotel - a guest that was staying at the front of the hotel said the same, no noise at all.  

The walk into the centre of Dublin is about 20 minutes, there are ample buses which cost about €1.40 and taxi about €10, so not a bad location at all. The room was very spacious and had all the usual you would expect from a 4 * hotel.   

Although breakfast wasn't included in our room price, I would recommend the full Irish breakfast for about  €15 it was really nice and served until 10.30am which is great for an early brunch.  The food at the Sideline Bistro was excellent, what more can I say.  Staff, quality of food served, standard of accommodation all excellent.  

Thanks Croke Park for making our stay perfect.",5,2012,06,27
211,Good and functional hotel.,"I stayed at the Croke Park last April. The hotel is easily accessible from Dublin Airport, as the shuttle bus drops you off just two blocks away; as many reviewers have noted, the property is right in front of the Croke Park Stadium, an iconic landmark by itself, although the area is certainly not the most convenient one for sightseeing; granted, there are plenty of public transport options, but if you prefer to walk you'll find that the city's main attractions are a 25-30 minute-stroll away.

We had booked a double and a triple room and upon check-in we were assigned two double rooms, which meant that some of us had to share a bed. Not a problem really, but I think the hotel should not advertise a triple room unless it is in the position of providing the guests with a real triple room, i.e. one that actually has three beds. 

Other than that, the rooms are spacious, very clean and with adequate facilities. The beds are wide enough (thank goodness, as I was the one who had to share) and comfortable, and the bathrooms boast both a bath-tub and a shower. There is plenty of space to store your luggage as well. Can't really comment on TV and DVD facilities as we were completely exhausted by the time we reached our rooms.

Buffet breakfast is scrumptious, really, featuring both your typical Irish breakfast ingredients as well as fruit and several other options, so we all gorged on food prior to engaging on our daily activities.

Staff, both at the front desk as well as in the breakfast room, is very nice and helpful. Breakfast staff is quite international, and you can find Spanish, Portuguese or (I think) Chinese speakers there.

There is also a small gym, good enough for a workout or some stretching for those who, like myself, made good use of the city's running possibilities (most notably Phoenix Park)

So, a good, no frills, functional hotel, with nice staff. Prices are very competitive by Dublin standards,  I guess the hotel's location has got something to do with that. Recommended.",3,2012,06,27
211,Good location and comfortable,"I stayed at the Croke Park hotel on 20th June, to be at an event starting in the Croke Park conference centre at 8:30 next morning. This worked out very well for me, as the location was perfect and very convenient for the conference centre.
The reception staff were friendly and efficient, and I was impressed by the hot towel on arrival and the bottle of water on check-out. My room was large and comfortable, with everything I needed. The only minor complaint is that the shower head drooped when water was flowing, but everything else was fine. Having free and reliable wifi is also important to me, and I have no complaints here.
Breakfast was good, though the staff seemed more rushed. I would have liked a selection of fresh fruit.
I would certainly stay here again, for the conference centre, and will recommend it to others.",4,2012,06,26
211,Very good hotel becomes distinctly average after price hikes,"We stayed for 2 nights (22 & 23 June 2012) as my wife wanted to see Westlife's final two concerts and I didn't want to walk into town for the night bus home afterwards!

There are good things and bad things about the hotel. The first good thing is the staff. We could not have faulted them and they were very friendly and accommodating, which they needed to be after our first night!

The Reception area is very welcoming and I do like large open areas when you get out of lifts - they had these on each floor.

The first bad thing affected our sleep on the first night. Our room, like many others, overlooked the outside bar area in the central courtyard. Initially this was not a problem as I assumed that the hotel's management would use common sense and close the outside bar at a sensible time and move patrons inside. This did not happen and it was necessary to phone down at 1am to ask staff to bring an end to the shouting and screaming from that area.  To be fair, the staff reacted very quickly and did so. We were then kept awake but the constant hum of the ice making machine located down the corridor!

The rooms are most definitely NOT soundproofed, no matter what their web site might say!

The following morning we asked to spend the next night in a room which did not overlook the outside bar. Owing to a breakdown in communications, when we returned later we had been put into a different room...overlooking an outside bar!  We were quickly moved to a room at the rear of the hotel overlooking the car park and given access to the Executive Lounge.

This was much better and we got a reasonable nights sleep.  However, on the Sunday morning we heard a constant tapping sound which turned out to be someone digging holes in the tarmac at the rear with a hammer and chisel. I know it has to be done, but at 8am on a Sunday morning? We didn't complain as we were already up, but we know that others did.

The rooms are large and well appointed. The beds are comfy but I'm not sure a 4 tog duvet is enough for most people, especially when there did not appear to be spare blankets in either of the rooms we stayed in.

Overall, I felt the hotel would have represented fair value for money if both nights had been charged at their usual 139 euro and the price had included breakfast. However, because there were events at Croke Park the hotel chose (understandably it has to be said) to whack up their prices to 299 euro per night. Unfortunately, this shifted it most definitely into the poor value for money bracket. Luckily we had booked the first night at their normal rates before they were aware a 2nd concert had been arranged. 

So, in conclusion, the staff were great but the hotel itself is just average. Increasing prices is normal when demand is likely to be high, so if you stay there when there isn't you should have a comfortable time. Shame breakfast is extra!",3,2012,06,25
211,Would recommend the Croke Park Hotel.,"We  were  touring  Ireland & the UK with friends and had a very nice stay at the Croke Park Hotel. To our delight, both sets of rooms were upgraded to Superior King Size Rooms, which included a very nice continental breakfast as well.   They were well appointed rooms , clean and comfortable with all the amenities including a seperate shower in the bathroom. The hotel is a little out of the city but if you want a quieter area then it is perfect.
 ",4,2012,06,25
211,very very rude staff,i was in the hotel on friday 22nd + was not happy with the staff they were very rude with one member of staff shouting at us!other guests were shocked at this!its a lovely hotel but i would not be rushing back!!!!,4,2012,06,25
211,Quality Hotel,"We stayed for two nights at the Croke Park hotel in May 2012.  The staff were very friendly, courteous and helpful.  The rooms were immaculate and very comfortable.  Our first room had a problem regarding an electrical short that kept shutting off our electricity.  We told housekeeping of the problem and within 5 minutes someone was there to assist us.  We were moved immediately to a new room just down the hall.  Breakfast is not included (we had understood that it was) and we found it to be a bit pricey, however, it was very good.  The second morning we decided to save money and we walked a couple blocks to a market  where they had fresh muffins and coffee.  The neighborhood around the hotel and between the hotel and the city made us just a bit nervous and we made sure not to be walking there after dark.  We recommend the hotel and we would not hesitate to say there again.",5,2012,06,18
211,Friendly and cozy,"Hotel staff was extremely friendly and helpful, offering advice and directions about the city. Easy to park at the hotel and then walk into downtown Dublin, maybe 20 minutes all through safe areas. Rooms were big, cozy, and comfortable. A great find at a reasonable price. Would definitely visit again.",5,2012,06,16
211,If you want to have a nice time in a high quality hotel.,"Nice service, spent one night only, but the staff was friendly, nice clean room and valuable staying. Highly recommended for anyone who want to spend a good time in Dublin.",5,2012,06,16
211,Hospitality at it's best!,"We had a great week long stay, enjoyed seeing the city and surrounding areas.   Food at the hotel was exceptional (!) and reasonably priced.  Our package included free safe parking, drinks, and a full breakfast.  
In our stay at Croke Park Hotel, we took a quick taxi downtown, and enjoyed a hop on/off bus which enabled us to sight-see at our leisure, 48 hours/16 euros each.  We took day drives to Cork, Bray and others. 
The staff was professional, cared about our comfort and stay, room was clean with wi-fi, shower and tub, air, great bed, very nice view from the 4th floor.  All comparably with expensive hotels in Orlando, Sarasota, Tampa and Miami.   We'd love to return to the Croke Park Hotel!",5,2012,06,15
211,"Great Hotel, in great location","Stay here in feb 12 and really enjoyed it, attending Croke Park, what a lovely Hotel, greast facilities, great organisation with such big crowds around the Hotel. Rooms large and very clean, comfortable, Had lunch in the bar and Breakfast was equally as good. All round great place high quality and dont mnd paying when service and quality is available . 
Also could not believe how quiet it was there.",5,2012,06,15
211,Simply Beautiful,Amazing service and beautiful rooms. The bathroom was amazing and so was the room. Room service was a bit pricy so we walked to the nearest market and bought some groceries and ate at the McDonalds close by. Parking was validated and it is right across the street from the Croke Park Stadium. The room views are not that great but overall it is an excellent hotel.,5,2012,06,15
211,Love this hotel-location is not a problem,"My Husband and I enjoyed a week at this hotel (first week of June) and loved it. The area is fine and there are pubs and restaurants close by. It is a 20 minute walk to the city center which for us was no big deal. We enjoyed the walk - even in the rain. The computers were always available for use in the lobby and we used them often. The food was great, rooms were awesome and quiet and staff were always happy and willing to assist. We especially enjoyed young waitress Lauren who works in the bar and of course the ever friendly and helpful Stephen (concierge). We hope to return again. Cheers from Canada",5,2012,06,14
211,Needs WiFi in all rooms,"What a shame to have this beautiful hotel, such comfy beds and great service in this 
poor location.  Unless you are going to a game at the stadium (which is immediately across the street), there is nothing to even easily walk to, not to mention I wouldn't walk alone in the area.

To top it all off, there's nothing nearby and unless you paid for an upgraded room, you will not have WiFi in your room to occupy the time.  You can not walk to the main Dublin areas, it's just too far. 

The hotel gets a 4/5 overall (if they had WiFi in all rooms I would give them a 5/5) and the location gets a 1/5.",3,2012,06,13
211,would not stay anywere else in dublin,spent another weekend in this hotel in april but i was only allowed to write the review now as i have wrote lots of them before and have stayed loads of times in this hotel and i can never find fault with it. we travelled with family and friends on our last visit and my brother and his wife ate in the restaurant on the friday night and they said it was great. as i said before i cant find a fault with this hotel so well done again to all the staff from the cleaners to the management. hope to see you again before the end of the summer.keep up the good work and thanks again for a fantastic weekend. love the breakfast and the free car park.,5,2012,06,12
211,Very Good!,"Having stayed in various hotels during our 14 day tour of the UK, this hotel is the Best !! Great rooms (Spacious) ,very friendly staff ( they said ""Hi , How are you"" whenever they met us , anywhere) ,Good Service ( Had a problem with the air conditioner in our room , but , after we told them , was repaired very fast ) . Couple of minor disadvantages would be the location (considerably far from the city centre ) and the food ( breakfast was OK , but , no choice for the in-room dining) .. Buy overall , we had a very good experience , would certainly return here..",4,2012,06,12
211,unhappy customer,"The Hotel is very nice but after checking in I realise 1 of the rooms I booked as a twin was actually a double with a camp bed. I got no satisfaction when I complained at reception, also the breakfast was cold. I would not recommend this hotel after my experience.",2,2012,06,12
211,FAB HOTEL,"Stayed for 2 nights, arrived early due to the terrible weather, we were going to walk around the city centre but the rain was awful so we went straight to our hotel. We checked in 09.50 and were delighted to be informed that our room was ready, we went straight to our room, this made a massive difference. The area is not brilliant and you do have a 15 minute walk to the city centre but we were aware of this, we like to walk, you can see more (if it's not raining) because the hotel is just outside the city centre it was very quiet at night which was lovely. We used the hotel bar which price wise was not bad for a 4 star hotel, compared to prices in the city. Food was lovely, breakfast was great, staff lovely. The atmosphere in the bar at night was lovely, buzzing. We would stay again.",5,2012,06,12
211,Great hotel,Very nice hotel with proximity to airport. Well appointed room with view of stadium and Dublin roof tops.  Bath had bathtub and separate shower!  Took my first bath ever in a hotel as a result.   Bath gel was fragrantly glorious!  Excellent breakfast buffet included in stay.  Hotel staff was especially courteous and helpful.  Convenient complimentary underground parking.  Hotel restaurant (Sideline Bistro) had outstanding food.,5,2012,06,10
211,Not to be faulted,"This hotel gave a very good level of service. We had a family room, it was spacious and comfortable with two double beds. Our room was cleaned every day and breakfast was superb. A huge choice of fruits, traditional breakfast, cheese, pastries and cold meats. Staff are very attentive offering drinks and toast the moment you sit down. The airport is only a €20 taxi ride so it's good value to transfer and only 15-20 minutes walk into the centre of Dublin. The only negative is that there is very little to do around the hotel other than the Croke Park tour and a super Italian restaurant that is just up the road from the hotel. We were busy all day so were happy not to venture out at night, thus avoiding the walk through a shabbier part of Dublin. Definitely to be recommended. ",5,2012,06,10
211,comfy,Went to a conference in croke park and stayed here. Comfy clean rooms and good staff. Nice place to stay but not exceptional.,4,2012,06,10
211,A Pleasure to Stay Here,"It's not in the centre of town and the surrounding area is a bit shabby but it is not an intimidating area, ignore all the comments about not walking at night. It seems a safe enough area if you take the usual precautions, its just there is nothing worth seeing or doing there.
Staff are brilliant, rooms are big and clean, the beds are comfortable. The food is so-so but edible.
Free wi-fi is a bonus. We were there for a concert at the 02 Arena and they arranged a bus for 7 euros return for all that wanted it. Brilliant service and great value.",5,2012,06,08
211,"Everything you want, BUT...","Great overall hotel experience, however it is not in a very good part of town. You dont want to be ouf walking at night. It is right across from Croke stadium, so perfect if you are in town to see a soccer match. You will have to take a taxi. Most clients were business people in town for a conference at Croke Park. The saving grace is the hop on-hop off bus stops there each morning. Lovely hotel and bistro though.",4,2012,06,08
211,Very Accommodating,"My sister, a good friend, and I stayed her just one night before our flight back to the States.  Reception was helpful and pleasant, the room was clean and the bedding comfortable. My friend and I had dinner at the Sideline Bistro but my sister was feeling unwell and did not join us. The food and service was very good but what impressed us the most was, when we asked if they might have some clear soup or broth to bring up to my sister, they went out of their way to make a delicious vegetable soup with chicken just for her! Everyone was very accommodating and attentive. If we are ever in Dublin again, we will definitely stay here.",5,2012,06,07
211,Great Hotel,"We spent three nights at the Croke Park Hotel in Dublin. It is a beautiful hotel across from Croke Park stadium. We arrived tired from a long ride and were greeted with warm wet towels and smiling faces at the front desk.  The reception area and the concierge could not have been more helpful. We were booked into a room on the executive floor which included access the the executive lounge.  There we found coffee, tea juice and water, as well as fruit and cookies.  In the morning they served what they called a continental breakfast but it included such things as cold meats, cheeses, smoked salmon, yogurts, cereals and pastries.  Everything was included in the modest cost of the room. Additionally, the parking was gratis as well. The rooms were the cleanest I'd ever seen.  The housekeepers even folded the clothes we left on the chair!
The only downside is that the hotel is quite a distance from the center of town. We used the shuttle to the ""Hop on hop off"" bus stop to get into town but the return shuttle stops at 2:15 PM, too early to be useful. We did have dinner one night in the hotel and it was not special but we ate at a nearby pub recommended by the hotel another night and the food was great.",5,2012,06,07
211,Great place to stay in Dublin,"We started our trip to Ireland at Croke Park where even though we arrived early they had a room for us and made us feel welcome. It's only about a 15 - 20 minute walk from the city center and, if you are driving as we were, has plenty of parking so you can avoid the center city traffic and get out of the city pretty easily, They have a great full Irish breakfast and the staff was extraordinarily friendly and helpful.",5,2012,06,07
211,1st time in Dublin,"This was our 1st trip to Dublin, this was not the first hotel we had selected but our TA switched hotels.
This Hotel was very clean and felt brand new!
The rooms had everything:
Comfortable beds, coffee maker, hair dryer, TV.  Bathrooms had a shower and tub.  Very modern.
The hotel had free wifi, but it only worked down in the lobby and bar. If you have a room that faces the interior courtyard, you might be able to get the wifi by sitting next to your window)
We had breakfast included in our reservation, the food was great.  Your typical Irish breakfast: Eggs, bacon and ham black pudding, sausage,  toast, cereal, juices. 
The hotel also had a restaurant, it looked good but we never ate there.
Nice bar area, with a lot of seating and a big screen TV with a fire place and couches.
The lobby was also very comfortable… and had two computer to use with a printer (no charge)
The people at the front desk were very helpful with any questions we had.

The only downside to the hotel is its location from central Dublin.  We never walked from our hotel to downtown.  We always took the bus.
I wouldn’t say this area is the nicest part of Dublin, but we never felt unsafe.  The Hotel is literally right across the street from Croke Stadium… thankfully there were no games while we were there… but my guess is that the area would be very crowed if there was a match.",4,2012,06,06
211,Lovely hotel,"What a lovely hotel. This was a business trip for me so I had to use a hotel on my company's approved Dublin hotel list but this choice proved to be excellent. I needed a hire car and a hotel with good access to the M50 and beyond and with free underground parking this fitted the bill. My wife accompanied me and we found that while this hotel looks quite remote from the Temple Bar action it is in fact a five minute walk from Mountjoy Square and then a five minute, €0.6 bus ride to Trinity College in the heart of Dublin. Very modern and contemporary hotel with a superb bar area, restaurant and lobby with free wi-fi. Lovely bedroom and stunning bathroom which was greatly appreciated. Was not looking for any faults and certainly did not find any. Enjoy!!",5,2012,06,06
211,Good hotel in Dublin,"I stayed at this hotel for a weekend in April 2012 as part of a large group (16 people).  The staff were friendly and helpful, the rooms were spacious and clean, the food was pretty good and the Guinness was reasonably priced.  We also got a great rate on the hotel room, which made the hotel very good value for money.

Just be aware that there is not much around this hotel (except for Croke Park Stadium) and you will need to get a taxi to and from the city centre.  We never had any problems getting a taxi and it doesn't take more than 15 minutes.  Also note that when there is an event taking place at Croke Park Stadium the bar and hotel get very busy.  

Overall, we were very happy with the hotel and would stay there again if in Dublin.",4,2012,06,06
211,A Very Good Hotel - A Little Out of the Way,"If you are staying at the Croke Park, please expect to take a cab if you plan to stay out late. It's a good 10 minute walk just to get to O'Connell Street. I am sure it's the best place to stay if you are attending a match. Location is the only drawback here and, honestly, it shouldn't be a deal breaker. 

The hotel is basically brand new. We stayed on the 4th floor in a large room with a very large and quite comfortable bed. I was shocked that our room was ready at the early hour of 9:30a. That was definitely a pleasant surprise. The shower was wonderful. For an overnight stay, I care about the sleep and shower experience. The shower was great. Good water pressure. Lots of hot water and plenty of room. 

The breakfast set-up was good too. Lots of HOT options to choose from in the morning. Who doesn't love a place that has nutella and croissants?

Buy a ticket on the GREEN Hop on Hop off bus before you go. They have seven shuttle stops to Croke Park throughout the day with the last one being around 6:30p. I guess if you're an early bird you won't have to worry about that late night taxi.",4,2012,06,06
211,Let's bring this back to reality a bit....,"Oh dear.  I suppose if you're attending a match at Croke Park then this really is THE place to stay but it really is far out from city centre, and even access to the DART system is challenging.  Buses are about a 5 minute walk and we used them but it got old after a week.  The beds were quite possibly the most uncomfortable I have ever slept in.  The bathroom door was poorly fitted, only opened with a large bang, possibly due to the hotel settling over time (there were cracks in the room plaster).  Rooms were clean and staff was friendly although didn't seem to communicate well with each other.  The room we had was smaller than average although there seems to be a range of sizes available.   Not up to the high rating it has received so far on TA.",3,2012,06,05
211,Fantastic hotel & staff!,"Me, my mum & sister stayed at The Croke park hotel for two nights during our trip to Ireland, having spent a horrible eight hours on the ferry crossing from Liverpool. when we arrived at the hotel three hours early for check in we just wanted to know if we could park the car & store our luggage somewhere until we was able to check in, when I walked in the hotel was suprised how lovely it was, the recepion area had lots of little sitting areas, three lifts & was so clean, I was approached by the concierge, I asked about leaving the luggage & he replyed that he would ask the reception if our room was available, when reaching reception I was given a hot towel for refreshment, we were able to check in & were told where to park & that there was a lift from the car park to our floor. When we reached our room we was astounded how clean & spacious the room was, there was plenty of closet space, a large bathroom with seperate bath & walk in shower & two double beds in the room & the room decor was lovely & neutral.  over the weekend we dined in the resturant for breakfast which was buffet style, & had a large selection to choose from from full cooked breakfasts to fresh fruit, cereal & yoghurt. The staff were exceptional & couldn't do enough for you, always asking if we were ok & if we needed anything, at reception we booked the hop on hop off bus tour from the hotel concierge which was a couple of euros cheeper than on the bus & you get two days for price of one. (the bus stops outside the hotel also a bonus) The location of the hotel is a little further out of the main town centre but its not to far to walk into the main O'Connell street area about 10 minutes & around €10 into the Temple bar area in a taxi. 
Overall the hotel was more than we could have hoped for & we are already planning our return! ",5,2012,06,05
211,Great Stay,"Stayed for one night and on the whole really liked it.  Rooms are spacious and bathroom is well laid out with fab shower and lovely toiletries.  

We had dinner in the bistro and the food was delicious but waiter a bit surly (he threw the condiments onto the table and looked like he would rather be anywhere than serving that night) which spoilt our enjoyment.

Bar area is nice although it would have been good to have had a few more sofas and comfier seats in this area.

The area is not the prettiest but it is conveniently located for accessing central Dublin.  All in all a good stay.",5,2012,06,04
211,Relax,"stayed here for 3 nights, the rooms are fab and the food was amazing, especially the breakfast buffet!! close to everything. recomended for buisness and pleasure",5,2012,06,03
211,First night in Ireland,"We stayed here a few weeks ago and we couldn't have had a better time.  The staff was very helpful in setting up a bus tour of Dublin since we were there only one day.  The room was clean and the shower amenities were nice.  My one complaint would be is that it is a bit away from everything.  There is a great Italian restaurant up the street.  Maybe a bit of cross promotion would be great for both venues?  Overall, we had a great time!!",4,2012,06,01
211,roisin joe and our 4 sons,just back from a weekend break from this hotel and have to say we loved it.me and my partner were there with our 4 boys and the staff cudnt do enough for all off us.the hotel is spotless and the rooms were basic but very very clean. the food and drink were very good aswell and far cheaper than wee thought it wud be .the staff even offered to babysit for us if we wanted to go out they were really really friendly and the manager well wee thought wee knew him all our lives he was that friendly.have to say wee will def be back at this hotel soon. so see u guys soon roisin and joe,5,2012,05,31
211,"Very comfortable, clean and friendly","Really solid hotel choice this one - nice rooms, very clean and helpful staff. I don't think it does quite enough to tip into the ""5 dots"" category but I can't argue with the value for money or service I received here during a recent business stay.

It isn't a particularly nice area of town but taxis are pretty reasonable in Dublin and this shouldn't cause you much of a problem.",4,2012,05,30
211,"Excellent hotel, defn","Stayed for 3 nights and would definitely come back here next time i visit Dublin. Very nice hotel, with modern facilities and excellent cleanliness. TV had lots of free channels including Sky Sports and Setanta which is always nice for sports fans! 

The restaurant/bistro was also very nice with delicious evening dinners. The continental and hot breakfast buffet is a must too. There are computers downstairs with free internet use for guests too, which is great if you want to check out local shows etc.

The only gripe is that the location is a bit out of the way, and in a random neighbourhood. It is literally seconds away from Croke Park stadium, which must be great on Rugby weekends, but for normal occasions, it's a bit of a walk to the city centre. Otherwise a taxi into town is about 8 or 9 Euros, and a bus (10 mins walk to the bus stop) is about 1.50 euros.

All in all, an excellent hotel with very nice and helpful staff.",5,2012,05,30
211,Very nice superb service,"We stayed there from the 10 may to 17 may, everything was excellent, great buffet breakfast, concierge service from Krishna Kumar was incredible, we got a problem with the Belfast tour that we asked the concierge to book for us, when we told the concierge about that problem he called the owner of the Belfast tour explain the problem and solved it to our satisfaction in less than 20 minutes we were leaving about an hour later and that confirm the wonderful experience of that Dublin hotel. I will recomment that hotel and the concierge to anybody going to Dublin.
Thanks again",4,2012,05,29
211,"Excellent, value for money","A great hotel with professional staff and lovely spacious and clean room. The Excellent breakfast. The only con is the location, somewhat far from the city.",5,2012,05,29
211,nice,Good solid hotel friendly check in staff check out chap was a little abrupt but overall a good experience. Very good value at £62 B&B for a single.,4,2012,05,28
211,Great place to stay when you're in Dublin,"Booked a room at the Croke Park Hotel based on the reviews, and happy we listened.  This is one of the nicest hotels we've stayed at in quite some time.  I can't think of a single negative except for the strange location, across the street from a soccer stadium and about a 25 minute walk from downtown.  I'm not complaining, just perplexed.  Why would they build a fine hotel like this in what seems to me to be a strange neighborhood?

OK, here are some of the good things I can think of.  First there is every amenity I could ask for, from a hair blower, shampoos, in-room safe, chocolates, etc.  Then there is a very comfortable king-size bed with feather pillows.  The bathroom is spotless with modern appliances, a great shower, and a separate bathtub.  Cleanliness was fabulous.  Really there is nothing wrong with this place and everything right, including the helpfulness of the staff.  Oh, I forgot about the breakfast, with unlimited smoked salmon, yum!

If you mind the 25-minute walk to downtown, you can take a taxi, which will get you there in less than 10 minutes.  You will not regret staying at this hotel (which is only about 4 miles from the airport).",5,2012,05,26
211,Good value for money and pleasant business stay.,I stayed for three nights. Good value for money. Excellent breakfast. Had dinner twice. Good food. Ok location. Less than 10€ with taxi to city central. Very pleasant staff. Quiet.,5,2012,05,24
211,Nice hotel,"We had a nice short stay in the Croke Park Hotel. The staff are very pleasant and friendly and the rooms are in a good condition and clean. The hotel is located in, what I would consider, a bad location though. There were some dodgy looking characters around the area when we were out and about in the evenings and so we were glad to have the car to get us in and out of the city centre for dinner etc. The hotel does offer complimentary car park, which is great, and we found that the cost of B&B accommodation was quite reasonable, considering the quality of the hotel and the buffet breakfast. All in all, a very good hotel. You will certainly get your value for money.",4,2012,05,20
211,Overall excellent: difficult to fault,"We were very impressed with the Croke Park. The staff on reception were friendly and helpful, and there were enough of them to avoid queues. The hotel overall is modern clean and well maintained. Breakfast is more than adequate, and the location is also good, with a regular free shuttle to the hop on hop off service. Highly recommended.",5,2012,05,20
211,Dublin Sojourn April-May 2012,"Croke Park hotel is the place to stay. A little off the beaten path for some but the reason we decided to stay at the Croke. It was a great decision. Clean, well run, great breakfast, and very helpful staff.",5,2012,05,20
211,smoking in rooms?,i liked the hotel on arrival and the rooms are pleasant and the staff helpful. my only complaint is that the smell of cigarette smoke has infiltrated my room all night. highly unpleasant. should't all hotels now make rooms non-smoking? i felt this really let down an otherwise very comfortable hotel.,3,2012,05,19
211,Excellent short stay,"I stayed here based on the positive reviews on tripadvisor. I was not disappointed. The hotel staff was extremely friendly and helpful. The rooms clean, well equiped and fairly new. 
I had one small gripe; it the bed linnen was covered in fluff. It seems the linnen were washed with the towels. No major drama, but laying out clothes on the bed resulted in them being covered in fluff. 
By the way, the hotel is right across the road from the Croke Park stadium. Unfortunately I did not have time to visit it, but apparently it is worthwhile if you are a sports fan.",5,2012,05,19
211,I have a new favourite Dublin hotel!,"I am in Dublin a lot to see family and friends. I was taken here by my sister and initially thought it might be a bit too far out looking at the map. I was wrong! It was just 10 minutes pleasant walk to O'Connell Street and made a nice change to stay this side of the river.

The room was on the Executive floor and was lovely and right opposite the Stadium. I was concerned it might be noisy with a huge match being played whilst we stayed there. But didn't hear a thing so that's great. 

The Executive lounge with free hot drinks, fruit and huge TV was a lovely touch and nicely done. Felt very special. 

Breakfast superb, ate in restaurant one evening which was lovely. Well recommended. 

And finally to mention the staff. Absolutely went above and beyond to ensure we were happy from the restaurant to cleaners to front of house. I will definitely be back here for my next Dublin trip. Delighted!",5,2012,05,19
211,Good Stay,"Had a nice week here.  Rooms are kept clean, very good food, nice bar area with a very big projection TV.  Really was impressed.  A bit of a walk to get;to the downtown area and the hotel is across the street from a stadium, also you are in what appeared to be a residential area.  A nice hotel, a bit out of the way (bring taxi money) but a very well run hotel.",4,2012,05,18
211,A Lovely Irish Weekend,"I stayed here last weekend with my boyfriend, his sister and her partner. As a previous Reception Manager from the DeVere hotel brand I am always very critical of where I stay. The check-in was brilliant, lots of information given and good upgrades offered, which tells me staff care about where they work and it seemed like they all enjoyed where they worked. 
The room was pristine, great toiletries offered, I would maybe suggest looking at your tea/coffee station as we had a few odd tea bags in there (I am not fussed with things like that, but for someone who was there was one normal tea bag and the rest fruit, however biscuit was a nice touch). Bottled water would have been nice too, however again was not a big deal. 
We got room service on the second night quite late, it was fab, however we were only provided with one set of cutlery when we ordered 2 meals and I had to ask for another set. Free Wi-fi down in the lobby was a life-saver! (We needed to check-in online for the journey home) and it is a nice peaceful area. LOVED hot towels on check in and bottled water on check out. Only down-fall is location. We walked to central Dublin a few times and the areas you have to walk through are not the best, this is not a fault of the hotel's though. We paid £210 for flights from London Heathrow and 2 nights at the Croke Park and it was worth every penny!",5,2012,05,18
211,"Lovely hotel, Great food","Stayed on an over night trip through Dublin.
Room adequate, Great shower, Very clean.
Food was great in the restaurant.
Breakfast was good only down side was by the time the toast came I had my breakfast finished!",5,2012,05,16
211,Luxury!,"Stayed for a short break over Easter, huge beds and bathroom with an executive lounge for endless cups of coffee! Slightly off the beaten track but well worth tge extra euros in a taxi!",5,2012,05,15
211,"Very nice hotel, poor location","This hotel is very nice although located in a rather poor neighborhood next to the Stadium. If you're here for an event or for just a place to stay, it's great. All the amenities and very nice people, excellent facilities and food. The only drawback is if you want to walk in the area, it's a little scarey. We walked from the hop on bus stop and didn't feel comfortable some of the way. Not a reason to avoid staying here, though, -just something to be aware of.",5,2012,05,14
211,"Nice Hotel, Bleak Surroundings","This is a nice looking hotel in a non-touristy part of Dublin.  It is a good 15 minute walk to the center of everything like Temple Bar.  When the weather is good, this is a nice walk.  When it is cold and rainy, this could be miserable.  There is no beauty in the area.  A large stadium sits across the street.  The neighborhood surrounding is somewhat ""dodgy"" as they say but not unsafe feeling.  The lobby and restaurant are nice looking.  There is a decent fitness center.  Restaurant food is pretty good too.  Hotel staff could not be friendlier.  Room was pleasant.  Real king size bed was comfortable.  Bathroom was spacious.  Overall and diamond in the rough with regard to this property.  It would have been a better value if breakfast was included.  But for a little more money I would have preferred a nicer part of the city.",4,2012,05,14
211,"Nice, comfortable hotel!","We stayed at this hotel 2 nights during our stay in Dublin.  The location is just on the edge of Dublin - close to the stadium.  It's a little bit of a long walk to the city center, but totally doable.  It's a very short drive.  There isn't a lot of great public transportation near this hotel so you'll need to get a taxi, drive or walk.  The hotel is really nice, clean and comfortable.  The rooms are fairly modern and a decent size.  It's a great value and they have a parking garage for your car if you have one.",5,2012,05,14
211,Absolutely Excellent,"My husband and I took his grandparents on a trip to Ireland as a surprise for their 61st wedding anniversary and his grandmother's 81st birthday. (Incidentally, we also celebrated our 7th wedding anniversary during the trip as well). We e-mailed the hotel in advance to let them know about the circumstances and just nicely asked if they could do something special in light of the situation. They promptly e-mailed back that they would see what they could do.

Upon arrival, we experienced the refreshing hot towels that others have mentioned, great after an overnight flight. They were also able to check us into our two rooms at 10 AM, which was wonderful (we were aware that early check-in was not guaranteed). Even better, they upgraded all of us to the executive floor with free breakfast and free wi-fi. This was awesome, especially given how expensive things can be.

Upon entering our rooms, both of them had balloons and a ""congratulations"" banner. Within 10 minutes of arriving, someone arrived with complimentary sparkling wine, another great surprise.

The rooms were extremely clean and spacious based on European standards. Our rooms were cleaned early on each day and we found no fault with the housekeeping efforts. One day it rained quite a bit and we asked if we could borrow an umbrella, and they immediately provided us with one to use. I would give the front desk staff an A+ for all of the interactions we had with them.

We dined in the bistro and the bar for a few nights. One thing that we did not know right away is that you can request the bar menu in the bistro- great if you want a little more variety. The waitstaff were overall very friendly and courteous- there was one gentleman (I do not remember his name) that was not as accommodating as the others, but this is a small detail. The quality of the food itself was excellent.

The hotel is a small walk from the city center, but really not that bad. We enjoy walking and my husband's grandparents in their 80's did not experience any issues. We only took a cab going to and from the airport and they took one once to go to dinner by themselves. We did not feel unsafe at all. There is one dodgy street on the way into town, but we found an alternate route that worked much better and took us through an area where there were many colleges and small hotels. As in any large city, do some pre-planning with a map, act as if you know where you are going, and don't stop for people trying to ask for money/sell you something.

We took a train from Connolly station (about a 10-15 minute walk) to Belfast and greatly enjoyed the day trip there. We saw some beautiful countryside and even beaches on the way.

Overall, the Croke Park Hotel was one of the most accommodating and friendly places I have stayed. The prices are very reasonable compared to city center hotels (and paying for two rooms for 7 nights this was a consideration for us) but they delivered more than most 5* hotels I have stayed in. I would definitely stay here again and recommend it for anyone traveling to Dublin.",5,2012,05,13
211,Faultless,"Just came back from a weekend stay at this hotel and I find it impossible to fault it. Attentive, friendly and diligent staff. Beautifully clean and comfortable rooms. Big fan of hurling so being opposite Croker was a bonus!",5,2012,05,13
211,Croke Park Review,"Excellent value, stayed on executive level using breakfeast option and it was well worth it.  Rooms were clean with all amenities and had turn down service.  Received 2 drink coupons per night with package chosen and yes we did use on Guinness.  Nice package deal booked direclty through hotel.  First time staying with this chain but will do so again when an option.  

Hotel staff were very knowledgeable for our holiday as this was our first time to Ireland.  We had plans on what to do and they advised us on driving, locations, things to do, etc.

My wife and I are very active travellers so they walk was no big deal and never felt unsafe at all times of the day and night.  It is 6-7 blocks from main tourist area but never an issue for us.  We walked to numerous things to and from the hotel.  No big deal.

Will recommend to others.",5,2012,05,13
211,Excellent hotel,"Stayed here for golf and had really good stay. Booked late via Expedia and got a good rate. Lovely clean room with 2 doublebeds. Not meant to be wifi in room but as I was on 1st floor there was. Breakfast a bit pricey and not too near town centre but if have car or take taxi only 10 min to gratton street.
Would definatly stay again though might be busy when stadium in use.",5,2012,05,12
211,Nice place...our stay was too short,"We booked only one night as this was our last night in Ireland. The hotel was very busy and quite lively in the bar areas. The room was nice but with only one issue: not enough lights near the beds. Although a trivial issue, milling about in your room felt like being in a nightclub. Wish we could have stayed in Dublin longer. You'd feel comfortable here for several days. Breakfast was excellent. ",4,2012,05,11
211,Great stay!  Highly recommended!  Location is an easy 20 min walk to City Centre!,"Loved this hotel.  Bought our 2 night stay on a deal so it was a bit of an 'unknown' when we turned up.  Thought we may get the worst room in the place.  Totally wrong!

Positives:   
We were greeted warmly on arrival and then allocated a room on the Executive floor with access to a private lounge with snacks and softdrinks.  In addition we were given vouchers for a free drink in the bar (each) plus vouchers for free scones in the bistro areas (wasn't part of the deal we bought and other guests had been given the same ).  Lovely.  
We had dinner in the restaurant the night of arrival, just lovely and the food was excellent.
Returned to our room each night to find a scented hot bed warmer in the bed and choccie on pillow.  Lovely touch.

Negatives:  Probably weren't any to be honest.  The location is an easy 20 min walk to the City and the views are a bit boring on the first 1/2.  The hotel does however have a free shuttle bus with specific times that you can take to the City.  The bus to the airport is just a short stroll to the back of the block.  We walked everywhere (and I'm not very fit) so it wasn't bad at all.",5,2012,05,10
211,Very Good....maybe even better,"We only stayed 1 night, but the hotel was immaculate, comfortable room & really good breakfast.",4,2012,05,10
211,Very friendly but a little far from the attractions.,"Traveled here with my husband and two small kids.  Definitely had a business-hotel feel to it.  It was booked as part of a travel package through Sceptre Tours.  I have the sense that they probably book hotels that feel as ""American"" as possible, so this didn't have any European city ""charm"".  The rooms were large, the bathrooms were clean.  Modern.  Full buffet breakfast was included.  The staff was very friendly.  When we arrived they only had 1 of our 2 children on the reservation, but they quickly made accommodations for all of us.  It was our first stop after the red-eye to Dublin so they also accommodated us by having the room ready early (by 10AM!).  The location was opposite the soccer stadium.  It was a walk but manageable.  The concierge Christian was extremely helpful.",4,2012,05,09
211,Great Value and very Family Friendly,"I availed of the hotel's package deal of Bed & Breakfast, Evening Meal and tickets to Dublin zoo for 2 adults and 2 children all for 199 euros and it was such good value. We were given a very spacious room with 2 big double beds. The rooms are very modern and clean and have all the facilities a family would need. Bathroom is also very big. Dinner was a delicious 3 course meal in the hotel's modern bistro and breakfast was also excellent. Car park facilities are excellent and free. Staff were very nice and child friendly, even offering the children games and lego to play with in the evening after dinner so we could enjoy some quiet time. I would definitely stay at this lovely hotel again if going to Dublin and would highly recommend it to families traveling with young children.",5,2012,05,07
211,Very nice hotel and good value,Stayed at the Croke Park Hotel for a weekend break and was delighted with the quality of the hotel.  Its located about a 20 minute walk to the city centre which is the only negative for me.  We booked the hotel through ebookers and really got value for money.  A taxi to College Green costs about €10.  Bar food was very nice and good enough value.  The complimentary parking was an added bonus.  Area around the hotel is a bit dodgy but nothing to worry too much about just be sensible. The room we stayed in was very nice and modern and the hotel is very well maintained.,5,2012,05,07
211,A really nice place,"We stayed here for one night while visiting Dublin Zoo. Great hotel and really nice, welcoming staff. Made our 7 year old very welcome too. A number of things worth noting: 
Free parking in a secure Car Park under hotel - This is a real bonus for Dublin. 
O'Connell Street a 15 to 20 minute walk away so no need for taxis. 
Hop-on Hop-Off Bust tour picks up at Hotel in any case.
Food in Restaurant was superb but, and my only gripe, service was slow. In fact I heard a number of customers comment on this and we ourselves left without having dessert as we had waited 20 minutes after completing our main course as no-one came to ask if we wanted one. The frustrating thing about this is that the waiting staff were really friendly and helpful when they got to you. If I were the chef here I would not be happy as the quality of the food is being forgotten amidst the poor service. I must emphasise however that that is my only gripe I would definitely return and would recommend to friends.",4,2012,05,07
211,"Great staff, great hotel. Will stay here again","Writing the review from hotel room which is very well appointed. Flat screen tvs, coffee maker, stereo.... We did get upgraded to a suite though. :-)
Stayed an extra night because it's so nice. Staff couldn't be nicer, always willing to help. Food is great in Restaraunt too!",5,2012,05,06
211,Well Worth a Visit,"Stayed for the second time at the Croke Park Hotel, Dublin. Excellent accomodation, food good, and staff among all functional areas very friendly and helpful. Car parking safe, secure and not over crowded. Will definitely return",5,2012,05,03
211,THE BEST IN DUBLIN,"Having returned from a weekend in The Croke Park hotel, I can describe it in one word - fabulous.  I booked my reservation through the efficient receptionist - Anne Marie.  She really is a true ambassador for the Croke Park hotel as she was very courteous on the telephone.  I have booked with Anne Marie many times and as always she is so delightful to speak with on the telephone.  I also spoke with Sean on the telephone before we arrived and he too was so efficient and courteous on the telephone, advising me that he would ensure that everything would be to our satisfaction as soon as we would arrive.  On arrival we were greeted by Ciara and Agnes in reception who ensured that our check-in was speedy and efficient. They presented us with hot towels in order to freshen up after our journey - what a lovely idea. A big thank you to these lovely receptionists. Of course our check-in would not have been complete if we weren't greeted by the ever popular Krishna who took great delight in offering to carry our luggage to the room.  He portrayed such warm hospitality - another plus for the Croke Park hotel - as he was able to remember our names from our previous visits.  Well done to Krishna!
Sean was also present to welcome us to the hotel and as we were returning guests he treated us to an upgrade on the executive floor - in fact the upgrade turned out to be a suite which was 
unreal.  We decided to have dinner in the evening which we hadn't booked for, but Tong - the receptionist in the restaurant advised us that she would ensure that we were able to dine there - and she did with little fuss.  We were also greeted by Helen in the restaurant who was just finishing her day's work but still took the time to have a chat with us. The meal was really delicious and we were waited on hand and foot by the ever efficient Raj.  He again was very courteous and always had a warm endearing smile for each one of his guests.  Sean visited us in the restaurant, inviting our opinion on their up to date menu which we all agreed was excellent as far as choice and price went so well done to Sean and his team.  Breakfast the following morning was delicious with such a wide variety of cereals, breads, pastries, fruit juices, fresh fruit and of course the Irish fry which was replenished every few minutes.  Agnes - the receptionist who checked us in was on the reception desk in the restaurant and we were amazed to note that she was able to remember each of our room nos.  Obviously the management have put a lot of effort into staff training.  We were checked out by Tara who again greeted us with warm hospitality and our check-out was completed within seconds. Stephen, the concierge, validated our car-park tickets without any fuss and was very amicable in doing so.  By the way the car-parking is complimentary - very rare in high-class hotels such as the Croke Park in Dublin these days!  Krishna - of course - also wished us a safe onward journey with a pleasant smile.  Sean also took the time to chat with us before we left the hotel.  We assured him that our stay was a very memorable one and that we definitely would return.  He was delighted to hear this and wished us a pleasant journey home - again with such warm hospitality.  We really had a marvellous stay and yes it really is - the best in Dublin!  Well done to the management of the Croke Park hotel and congratulations to all the staff.",5,2012,05,02
211,Love it,"You could sit in the comfortable lobby all day.  When the weather is nice the outside area is beautiful.  Hotel very clean directly oppisite croke park but I stayed there when going to O2 and it was a 5 minute drive away.  Free computer access in the lobby which I used to book another stay at the same hotel.  Food in restaurant beautiful, staff lovely and great selection the next morning for breakfast.  Will stay there again and again",5,2012,05,01
211,Very relaxing hotel,Stayed in The Croke Park Hotel for the last weekend in April. They were fantastic from start to finish. Our room was ready when we arrived at 12. When we went to our room they had it decorated with balloons and a banner as they knew it was our anniversary which was a lovely touch. The rooms are clean and spacious. The staff could not be more helpful from ordering taxi's to looking after our luggage. The food was delicious and served promptly considering the restaurant was full. We would definitely stay there again on our next trip to Dublin.,5,2012,05,01
211,Near perfection,My wife and myself stayed here on Sunday night for the first time. With the stadium just across the road it's very handy for games. And being in a wheelchair handiness is important to me. Food was very good. Service and attention from staff was excellent. Will definitely be back and would certainly recommend the hotel.,5,2012,04,30
211,Excellent hotel,"Just got back from a weekend break in Dublin where we stayed at the Croke Park Hotel. Rooms were very comfortable, the restaurant served really good quality food, all areas of the hotel were very well maintained / clean and the staff were exceptionally friendly and helpful. Would recommend the Croke Park Hotel to anyone.",5,2012,04,30
211,wonderfull hotel,"Have just come back from ireland, we had a great time, this hotel is first class could not fault it, all the staff were so friendly, and nothing was any trouble, we will go back again.",5,2012,04,30
211,A good stay,"Recently returned from a 2 night stay. We had a deal with travel zoo that included dinner on the first night and breakfast. 
We arrived quite early and were greeted with hot towels to freshen up. We were incredibly pleased to find that our room was ready even at 10am!

Our room was very clean and we also had use of the executive lounge where there was complimentary drinks and fresh fruit. 
Our evening meal was very pleasant, the waitress made the mistake of pouring my wine in to my water glass. She was very apologetic and replaced the wine immediately.
It was a good 20 minute walk in to town but we didn't mind as it was good to burn off the lovely breakfast each morning!!
The only slight niggle was that we had to ask for tea and toast each morning at breakfast as the waiting staff were not really paying attention to who was coming in.
All in all we had a good stay at this hotel!
",4,2012,04,26
211,Overbooked,"Like NastyAnderson said, they overbooked their rooms so we were bumped to another hotel as well. I also booked this through Scepter Tours. It actually turned out for the best, because we were put in the another 4-star hotel closer to the city centre. If we would have stayed at The Croke, we would have needed a taxi to get to and from the city centre. Instead we just had a short walk. So it was a blessing in disguise for us. Plus, The Croke was very accommodating in paying for our cab to and from The Croke to our assigned hotel, so it wasn't a loss at all.

So I can't really comment on much, because we didn't get to experience anything outside the lobby.",3,2012,04,26
211,Clean and Quiet,"My mother and I stayed here twice, and found it very clean, quiet, and comfortable. The rooms aren't enormous, but there is plenty of space and convenient coffee/tea service in each room. They have free parking underground, which was a huge bonus! The breakfast room was fantastic, and we received vouchers for a discount. 

The location isn't central (unless you are going to Croke Park Stadium for an event). But it is close enough to the bus line, and also very quiet and tucked away from the touristy part of Dublin. I haven't stayed here when there is an event at Croke Park Stadium, but I imagine it would be sort of crazy at this hotel since it is directly across the street!",5,2012,04,26
211,"Overbooked at Croke Park Hotel,DubLin","We were booked thru scepter tours at the Croke Park in Dublin for the last night in Ireland.  I called ahead and found out there was underground parking available,so we parked and came up the lift to check in about 5:30.We were told there was a glitch. They had overbooked.  How does that happen?????  And they were moving us to the Gresham on Oconnell st.  We left our car there took a cab to the other hotel checked in...found out they had parking as well...not told that.  The room was ok. A queen bed for 2 women. Tight. Had to get up much earlier next morning to take cab back to Croke Park,get reimbursed for cab fare,get parking stamped and no time for breakfast because of all the hustle.  No reimbursement for that! Too much hassle to stay there again!!!",2,2012,04,25
211,Celebration for my mum and dad!!!,"My mum and dad have just returned from a long weekend at the Croke Park Hotel (myself and my brothers sent for dads 70th and their 50th wedding anniversay ). They cannot praise this hotel enough. I had emailed hotel before they went to tell them about their celebrations. 
1st they upgraded them to the executive suite, 2nd they put banners and balloons up for their arrival, 3rd 2 mini bottles of bubbly were there complementary for them and 4rth the staff were all so very friendly, curtious and helpfull to them. My mum and dad were bed and breakfast and they stated that the breakfast was delicious there was a vast variety of food for them to choose from both hot and cold foods available. The room was spacious, clean and tidy. they cannot fault anything about their stay here and would definately stay again if returning to Dublin.
I would like to thank ALL the hotel staff for making thier celebrations memorable and their stay comfortable for them, and will definately reccomend this hotel to anyone I know that will be going to Dublin. Once again thank you so much x",5,2012,04,24
211,"Overall, a good hotel","This is a really decent place.  The rooms were clean, everthing functioned well and the staff was helpful and pleasant.  I was on the executive floor, so had access to WiFi and a lounge.  On lower floors, you only get wired internet.  The hotel is a bit far from the city center, but the bus stop is close by.  You can get to the Temple Bar/Trinity College/St. Stephen's Green areas in about 15 minutes for around 2 euros via the city bus.",4,2012,04,23
211,Not in my Top 15,"Stayed there over a weekend. Never again..We had no internet so we had to call down to get cables sent up to our room to get it. Ate in the restaurant which was nice, watching the rugby on the big screen. As for the night sleep, was woke up constantly from 1am-5am by people/drunks. Actually could hear 1 guy stumbling & falling about in his room, next door to us then his snoring. Walls way to thin. Never will stay there again unless I'm out on a drinking weekend.",1,2012,04,21
211,clean at its best,"Upon entering this hotel, the first thing I noticed was how clean it was.  My room was immaculate.  I saw the staff scrubbing rugs that didn't even look dirty.  They also have face cloths, which I soon learned is not the norm for European hotels.  The food was very good as well as having an excellent value for the money.  The staff was very friendly and helpful taking the time to answer all my questions and offer advice on activities I had planned.  A nice walk on a nice day off the beaten path but there is a shuttle right outside the door to take you to the first stop on the hop on hop off tour of Dublin.  I have already recommended this hotel to friends who are visiting Dublin this summer.  The cleanliness of the hotel and the friendliness of the staff will make this hotel my temporary home the next time I visit Dublin.",5,2012,04,21
211,"Great hotel, don't worry about the location!","This hotel, unsuprisingly located opposite the amazing Croke Park Stadium, is definitely somewhere we would stay again. The rooms are very smart, modern and clean with large bathrooms and there is a large bar area with a bistro attached, both selling a wide variety of decent food. Everyone in the hotel was friendly and the service in general was great. There is free wi-fi in public areas which is helpful given that wi-fi is limited in Dublin. One last thing ~ I've seen a few reviews saying the hotel is too far away from the centre and the area is a bit rough. Nonsense. It's 20 mins from the centre if you know your way and it's no worse than most of Watford (which is fine, by the way!). ",4,2012,04,20
211,Dublin luxury,"I booked this for a romantic city break with my wife and we stayed in a very comfortable well appointed room. The hotel staff are very friendly and nothing is too much trouble for them. Food, whether you eat in the bar or the bistro, is excellent and very plentiful. The hotel is very smart and spotlessly clean. If you are driving there is a secure underground car park. The hotel itself is about one mile from the main city centre, which we walked, or there is a bus service or taxis readily available. We would definitely stay here again.",5,2012,04,20
211,"Stayed 1 night, great hotel","My husband and I stayed here for one night as part of a tour package with Sceptre Tours.  Very nice hotel.  The room was clean, check-in was efficient, and free parking.  We ate at the hotel bar which was very nice.  The room came with a free buffet breakfast which was also very good.  We did walk from the hotel to the city centre which was about a 20-25 minute walk.  The hotel is right across the street from the stadium.",5,2012,04,19
211,A good hotel for business and pleasure in Dublin,"I stayed in the Croke Park Hotel quite a few times over the last few years and I have never been disappointed. The hotel is located opposite to Croke Park stadium in Dublin, the location is the only weakness of this property (if you are not staying there for a GAA match) as it is a bit far from the centre of Dublin with nearly no good facilities at walking distance. Therefore it is a great place if you have a car (free parking in the garage) or if you are part of an organized group. Apart from this, I always found the Croke Park a good place to stay. The service is good (for Dublin standards), on occasions a bit slow in checking in or checking out. The rooms are reasonably sized, well appointed and well kept. The bar is quite nice and the restaurant is reasonably priced. Good Irish breakfast if you are into fries in the morning. Free wifi in the lobby and free internet in the rooms.",4,2012,04,18
211,First Class,Stayed here for three days around Easter time and found the service and staff to be first class - the two restaurants we were recommended to visit were excellent and nothing was too much trouble for or too small for the staff to help with. The rooms were clean - the maid very helpful - the beds comfortable - the bathroom was fine with a nice selection of free shampoos etc. The breakfast was very good with the dishes changed regularly so they didn't congeal or get cold. The location is good so you can get around Dublin - there is also the added bonus of a free underground car park - locked at night. If you wanted a taxi - well we didn't wait more than 3 minutes for one. I would stay there again and thoroughly recommend this hotel.,5,2012,04,18
211,Excellent hotel.  Could not be faulted.,"We got what I initially thought was a good deal paying £171 for 3 nights Bed & Buffet Breakfast.  Having now stayed the 3 nights, that price seems ludicrously cheap.  We paid a Travelodge price for a genuine high quality 4 star hotel.  It offers large bedrooms that include bathrooms big enough to have a seperate shower, and not one combined with the bath.  But it is the staff that were most impressive.  They provided a really efficient and friendly service. For example, on the first night we were there, we ate in the restaurant, and at the end of the meal the waitress routinely asked my wife ""Had she enjoyed her meal?""  On being told the lamb was a bit grisly, within 2 minutes the Head Waiter had arrived, seemed genuinely upset, and when my wife politely declined the offer of a new different meal, the price of her meal was wiped from our bill.  I know this is probably what they're trained to do, but it was the speed and apparent sincerity of the response that was so impressive.  Further meals were fine, and the choice of food at breakfast is excellent.  You can fill up with a week's allowance of saturated fat if you wish, or have the rabbit food option as a healthy alternative.  The staff were superb in giving tourist tips and arranging transport.  The hotel offers a free bus shuttle service to O'Connell Street, as part of the purchase of a 2 day hop on hop off bus ticket that allows punters to be given the full tour of the city centre.  The shuttle is useful as the hotel is about 20 minutes walk from Dublin centre, although local buses can be caught a few hundred yards from the hotel's front door.  On the positive side the hotel is on the airport side of the city, and we only paid 16 euros for a one way trip, which is cheaper than we were told.  In summary, this place is great, and is heartily recommended.",5,2012,04,17
211,LOVE IT !!!!,"Just returned from an Easter break at the Croke Park Hotel, our second visit there and again nothing disappoints. Lovely warm towels on arrival and drinks for the kids and an Easter egg hunt organised for Easter Sunday.  All you could want for breakfast and beautiful tasty meal in the restaurant, the staff are all extremely warm and friendly, I can't praise it enough, I love it, Go and try it  and I guarantee you will not be disappointed !!!",5,2012,04,17
211,100 PER CENT,"Stayed here saturday14th of april while in dublin visiting friends,have stayed in this hotel at least ten times now but never wrote a review till now,its in a good location and if you are worried about parking this hotel is perfect because it has a free underground car park that is locked up at night,didnt eat at the hotel but the bar was lovely with typical dublin prices,room was spotless and we were allowed to check in early without any problem at all,taxi can be called from reception and we didnt have to wait longer than two mins for it to arrive,queit and peacefull stay even with exams and two gaa games on at the stadium across the road,room was spotless and maids are very polite",5,2012,04,16
211,Amazing,"Best hotel we have stayed in to date. All the staff were brilliant and friendly. Always someone to ask about everything and anything. Room was fantastic, chocolates left on our bed in the evening! The sideline bistro serves beautiful food, evening menu and breakfast x2. The only downside is that it's a 10 minute walk back to hotel where tour bus drops off but thats hardly a negative. 
Can't wait to go back!",5,2012,04,15
211,Staff need more training,"While not a guest at the hotel a group of us decided to have a mini-reunion there today. The location is brilliantly central, near enough town but removed enough to be peaceful and relaxed. It is within walking distance of several local amenities-the national stadium, the GAA museum; etc the interior is gorgeous, modern, tastefully decorated. The entire premises gleams and shines. Parking is free for all customers.
We are not the type of customer who uses premises to nurse a jug of tap water; we had planned a three course lunch with drinks. I arrived first and was literally pounced on asking did I want a menu/tea/coffee. No hello, no good afternoon. When the second girl arrived she was equally bared down on. We ordered two coffees we did not really want but felt obliged to do so.
When we were all seated the waitress offered the menus in a really rushed way, no politeness, no recommending the specials etc. While eating I was really angry at the way plates with a bite or two remaining /glasses with a few drops of wine remaining were pulled off us. The staff was brisk,irrated and hurried, there were plenty of tables available for arriving patrons. We were asked several times ""were we ready"" if we lowered our cutlery to chat between mouthfulls.There was a real sense of being rushed, annoying the waiting staff, being a nuisance. And at €9.50 approximately for tea and a slice of cake to round off our meal we were paying sweetly for the right to courtesy.
We asked four our bill. We waited ten minutes, we asked again. At the counter I saw staff members openly bickering. We never heard a thank you, a ""have a nice day”, a goodbye. I would urge a serious revision of customer services techniques and policies.",3,2012,04,13
211,Wonderful Easter Weekend,"What a wonderful hotel!!!  This place is awesome!  We stayed here over Easter weekend 2012.  The service was outstanding and the staff very warm and friendly.  I so appreciated the effort the staff made for Easter.  My kids loved the ""Kids Club"" and the Easter egg hunt that the hotel sponsored.  I was able to spend some quality time with my husband while the kids played and had fun meeting new kids from other parts of the world.  With just a short walk to the downtown area, the walk was refreshing and eating too much for breakfast!  The room was comfortable and very clean. I absolutely loved receiving a e-mail prior to our arrival and the staff helped us with our airport pick up and drop off.  The food was very good and the executive lounge was a great way to ease the day.   I highly recommend this hotel with such lovely people and accommodations.",5,2012,04,11
211,It's the little things that make the difference,"Have just returned from another stay at this fabulous hotel.  We arrived early morning to a warm welcome by reception staff and were informed our room was ready.  We were there for Easter weekend for my boyfriend’s birthday and we were greeted by balloons and a happy birthday banner in our room !  The exec lounge provides drinks and snacks throughout the day and a breakfast buffet which is sufficient – I would say a toaster would be a valuable addition though to save the staff making it to order, I do love my toast in the morning !

Our first stay was several years ago and I can honesty say the room we had looked like new – no signs of the usual wear and tear.

Had lunch in the bar both days and the food as always was yummy.  There was a match on at the stadium on the Saturday but the bar didn’t seem claustrophobic with the additional traffic.  

I love this hotel and would recommend it to anyone, the staff can't do enough for you.  Stay here and you won’t be disappointed !",5,2012,04,09
211,"Bit of a hike to downtown, but a great hotel","We recently stayed here for a few days at the start of a walking trip in more rural Ireland.  The only mild negative was that it was a longer walk downtown to sights and most restaurants than we anticipated, but weather was good, so we didn't mind.  Our room was very comfortable, and we opted at check-in to upgrade to the 4th floor, where we enjoyed the lounge and the excellent continental breakfast.  All the hotel staff we met were friendly and efficient.  Food in the hotel restaurant was very well-prepared.  The neighborhood was not the greatest, but the hotel itself is a really nice place.",5,2012,04,07
211,I enjoyed staying in this hotel,"The room was quite and spacious, bathroom fantastic - separate bath tub and shower cabin. Nice choice in the mini bar and it is autamatically calculated to the room number when you lift up anything from the mini bar, which is quite comfortable  - no need to memorize what you took:) shampoo, shower gel and body lotion are quite handy and are refilled everyday. Comfortable bads. Very nice food in the restaurant and resonabely priced. Very attantive service and breakfast is huge with evrything you can desire. Not far to anything really. No need to take a hop on hop off bus as you can just walk this distance around the city in just several hours (if you fond of walking:).",5,2012,04,04
211,Exceptional staff!,"I stayed here for a night recently and had to submit a review based on the staff. We felt really welcomed and the staff seemed genuinely happy in their jobs - there's nothing worse than a miserable receptionist/waitress. 

Would recommend staying here, it's a 10 min walk to O'Connell Street and is opposite Croke Park stadium.",5,2012,04,03
211,Hot towels on arrival!,This hotel does the little extras to make your experience great.  We got hot towels on check in and water bottles on checking out.  They were very accommodating with reservations or arranging transportation.  The rooms were very nice and the breakfast buffet plentiful.,5,2012,04,02
211,Great Dublin stay,"Stayed here based on other reviews, and was very impressed by the staff, the room and the breakfast buffet. Left the rental car in the hotel parking area and took a taxi for €10 to town for drinks. It's not that far from downtown, and didn't want to worry about parking in town. Booked on galahotels.com and got the breakfast included for a very special rate. Great hotel experience, would stay again.",5,2012,04,01
211,Great Hotel and Great Staff!!,"My partner and I stayed here for four nights at the end of March and we were both really impressed with everything about the hotel. The staff were pleasant and friendly and the room was spacious and welcoming - a bit more than a standard hotel room. The location is a little out the way of the centre of Dublin, about a 20 minute walk, but that's not enough to detract from an otherwise really enjoyable stay. For those who would rather take a Taxi into the centre it shouldn't cost any more than 10 Euros. If you're taking a taxi from the airport, it cost us 20 Euros. Would happily stay here again and recommend to friends and family. Thanks to all the staff for a really enjoyable stay!!",5,2012,03,31
211,Nice Hotel,"Had a great time in Dublin in February 2012.  First visit, wife found hotel on internet and it was good price (99euros a night).  Got lucky and a helpful guy at the airport told us how to get to the hotel using a city bus.  Wife told me it was across from a park, it isn't quite a park so much as a GIANT soccer stadium.  If you are going to some type of event at this stadium it would be the closest possible place you could stay.  If your there to see the city, it is about a ten euro taxi ride from temple bar/anywhere else in the tourist area.  No direct bus or tram lines we could find to get into the city, so it was kind of out of the way for us.  when we checked in they offered us the 10 euro per person free breakfast, which turned out to be worth it, as it comes with access to free bottled water and a nice lounge area.  Also got a free drink at their very nice hotel bar for each night of visit.  I recommend this place if you are going to any event in the stadium, otherwise save the taxi fare and stay in the city.",4,2012,03,31
211,Wonderful Stay/Terrific Service,"My family stayed at the Croke Park for a week over St Patrick's Day.  St Patrick's Day is my wife's birthday and I mentioned this when I checked-in.  When we returned to our room on the afternoon of her birthday, the staff had put a ""Happy Birthday"" sign over the mirror with balloons!  They also sent complimentary champagne!  The room was very clean, the staff was extremely helpful.  It is a little farther from the city center than some of the others, but it is a nice walk or a quick cab ride.  I HIGHLY recommend this hotel to anyone stayong in Dublin.  You will be happy with your choice!",5,2012,03,29
211,Fantastic Hotel,My wife and stayed at the Croke Park for 3 nights.What a great hotel all the staff were so friendly and helpfull.The room which we were upgraded to was lovely and clean.I cannot praise the hotel enough and would certainly recommend the hotel to anyone visiting Dublin.,5,2012,03,29
211,Excellent hotel would highly recommend and will definitely be returning!,"Have just returned from a 4 night stay at the Croke Park and cannot say enough about this excellent hotel! No member of staff stands out as they are all exceptional. Breakfast was delicious and had all you could want for breakfast. We even had a complimentary upgrade to an executive suite as we were celebrating a
Special occasion. Will definitely be returning! ",5,2012,03,28
211,A safe evening in Dublin,"We found the hotel to be very nice , clean and modern. Our room had a large bathroom and was very close to the three elevators to the lobby. The restaurant had a great breakfast with some of the only fresh fruit we found in our stay in Ireland. The staff was very friendly and helpful with everything from smoothing the way for paying of tolls on the internet to handling parking and baggage management. This was our last night in Ireland and with the help of the staff we found a nice restaurant for our last evening meal. It was a nice way to end our stay in a beautiful country.",5,2012,03,27
211,AMAZING Hotel!!!,"My friend and I stayed at the Croke Park for five nights over St. Patty's weekend. All the staff we encountered at check-in, at the restaurant, room service, all the way to check out were warm, friendly and so very helpful! We read many reviews for the Croke Park before heading to Ireland (which were all outstanding of course) and we were NOT disappointed! The food at the restaurant was reasonably priced and delicious! The beds were soooo comfortable! The housekeeping staff were phenomenal! Service in general was exceptional! We would certainly stay here again as it was a fabulous experience, the staff truly made us feel as if we were at home! The hotel was also only about a 20 minute walk to O'Connell Street (City Centre) and it was pretty straight forward, just follow the Spire! :) Or anywhere from 6-12 euro's for a taxi (not bad at all)!

The only thing that we were displeased with was the fact that we were charged for all outgoing calls from our hotel room. We mostly made calls to a toll free number as we were using an international calling card to call family at home. We had done the same on a previous trip to Ireland and were never charged at the hotels we stayed at before so we were a bit taken aback. The staff did mention this to us when we inquired, however, we did not fully understand so it was just a miscommunication not the hotels fault. We just didn't understand why the need to charge for toll free calls.

Anyway, regardless, amazing hotel definitely a MUST if you're in Dublin!!",5,2012,03,27
211,LOVELY HOTEL,"This is a lovely hotel.  We were very pleased with our room.  It was well organised, spacious and clean.  The bed was large and very comfortable.  It was very quiet,  The bathroom was very nice.  We ate in the bistro once and the restaurant once - both times the service was pretty good, the food nice.  The only reason I don't give this hotel 5 stars is the location is not great.  It is a short walk - maybe 10 minutes - into O'Connell Street but the area is a bit dirty.  I would stay there again though.",4,2012,03,27
211,Excellent Hotel,"My husband, 14-month old daughter, and I stayed here over St. Patrick's Day weekend (2012) on our initial arrival in Ireland.  The staff were excellent about checking us in early (our flight arrived at 8am local time; we were checked in before noon), and had a pack-and-play already set up in the room for my daughter.  The concierge was phenomenal about recommending the best way to get around (the hop-on, hop-off Dublin bus, green one... bonus: get a discount of 2.50 euro when you buy from the concierge vs. buying on the bus itself), where to go locally for a kid-friendly dinner, and the best place to see the parade from!  Breakfast was great, albeit a bit pricey.  Directly across the street from Croke Park Stadium, which is great if you want to catch a local game!  The rooms were clean and cozy (we had a king-sized bed) and well-equipped.  We highly recommend!",5,2012,03,26
211,Great relaxing stay,"Frequently use this hotel.   The location is excellent for easy access to the city and business areas north and south.   Menu is short and plain but food is plentiful and tasty.  The bar is relaxing and serves food late.

Rooms are very clean and well equipped.",5,2012,03,26
211,Pleasant,"Good value for money, clean and spacious rooms.just stayed for one night but really enjoyed the stay.had dinner in bistro and enjoyed it breakfast was good ",4,2012,03,25
211,good value and quiet area,"the room was lovely and clean. It took about 20min to get downtown. We took a taxi home every night, 7-10 euro, not bad at all.
we only had access to the internet via cable wich is a bit bothersome in 2012.. at check-in the receptionist tried to sell us access to a lounge and breakfast for 120 euro for our stay. for that price we could have gotten a better room and with breakfast when I booked... we declined.
when we waited to check out I overheard the couple in front thanking the staff for their upgrade of room,access to lounge and breakfast FREE!! I am still pissed! Why should they get this for free and not us? They also got tips on a bus that they could use downtown and lots of helpful tips, as we got nothing when we checked in. 
We were polite and not in a bad mood or anything when we checked in, so I don't think we are to blame for this. Based on being treated as a lesser of a guest, I would not stay here again.",3,2012,03,24
211,Croke Park Hotel,"Just wanted to say that the Croke Park Hotel is great.  I was there for a week, including 
St. Patrick's day weekend, and had a wonderful time.  My room was spacious and comfortable.  I highly recommend it.  My compliments to the concierges, Robert and Christopher, both of whom were accomodating and helpful.  I would also like to thank the Front Desk for providing a warm face towel upon arrival after a long flight.  How often do you find that?  I'll be back.",5,2012,03,23
211,martham,"Staff was very helpful. They arranged a shuttle pick up at the hotel and provided a wheelchair for our group,  The rooms were very nice and modern.  The brunch served in the morning was fabulous.",5,2012,03,23
211,International standards and Irish charm,"I stayed in the Croke Park Hotel several years ago shortly after it had first opened.   It was a fantastic hotel then and I am delighted to report that nothing has changed.

Situated across the road from the GAA Stadium it is also convenient for Dublin Port and the Airport.   Temple Bar is a 7 Euro taxi ride away.

The room was great, a huge, comfortable bed and everything you could need for a great stay.

The Flatscreen TV is a little dated nowadays but still perfectly functional as was the CD player.

The staff were extremely helpful, always smiling and always quick to great you no matter what time of the day.

The restaurant was a surprise.   In a good way.   I have eaten in hotel restaurants around the world and have often been disappointed.   However, while the Croke Part menu is not big the dishes were really well prepared and delicious.   I ate two dinners and a breakfast whilst there and everything exceeded my expectations.

Finally, the bar reflects the sporting connection.   There is a good choice of draught beer and plenty of outlets (You won't be kepy waiting too long, even on a match day).   The Guinness was excellent (Well this is Dublin!) and not too expensive (I found several bars in the City Centre that were more expensive).",5,2012,03,23
211,Very Pleasant Experience,"We stayed here on our first mini trip with our new baby.  Daunting as no idea what to bring.  Arrived to the desk and the baby got sick on their floor mortified.  But they were wonderful about it.  They had a travel cot for us. offered to store our baby bottles if we needed.  

 I did think that the rooms were slightly small esp with the cot in it 

The food in the restaurant was amazing for evening meals I was really impressed.  Breakfast is a buffet which personally I am not the biggest fan of.  But they had a big selection of foods on offer.  I really enjoyed my stay at this hotel.  The staff were lovely and there is free parking and wifi which is a big bonus",5,2012,03,22
211,Clean but not the greatest location,"My husband and I stayed here our last night in Dublin.  We did not choose this hotel as it was prebooked for us by the company we bought the travel package from.  If you were going to a game at the stadium across the street it would be perfect.  But, if you are looking to park your car and walk around to fun pubs and restaurants, forget it.  I see absolutely no reason to stay here unless you were attending a game.  But, it was clean and comfortable.  The business center printer was not hooked up when we were trying to print our boarding passes at 3:30 a.m. which was a bit inconvenient.  Parking, however was free and onsite which was convenient.",3,2012,03,22
211,Great place with excellent staff,"Arrived very early for checkin, was given the option to take a room :-) great for us since we wanted to enjoy the parade that day.  Great bed, plenty of space for two, and a wonderful bathroom.  Only thing I'd change is proximity to city center but it is right across the street from the GAA Croke Park Stadium.",5,2012,03,21
211,March 2012 stay at Croke Park,"Was pleasantly surpriesed by how nice the hotel was, it was clean,modern, had friendly / helpful staff and good bar grub.  A little bit of a wald to town but manageable, it was only a 6 euro ride to town and the hop on hop off bus has a stop that is within a 15 minute walk from the hotel.  The included breakfast was well stocked and more than sufficient.
The concierge was extremely helpful, when we asked about a nice pub to eat at he recommended Oliver St. Johns - Gogarty in the Temple Bar District.  He then also arranged a cab for us to get to the Hop-on - Hop-off bus, this taxi driver was execellent and actually when we asked him for a recommendation for lunch he took us to the same pub that had been recommended by the concierge without prompting.  Needless to say we were very pleased with our experience at the Croke Park Hotel and will use this location when we return to Dublin.
We would like to send a special thank you to our concierge Robert who was so friendly and helpful to us.  Stay at the Croke Park you will not be disappointed.",4,2012,03,21
211,Wonderful hotel. Brilliant stay.,"My Mother, Aunt and I went on a four day trip to Dublin for their 76th and 81st birthdays respectively. The hotel and staff were wonderful and helped make it a really memorable trip. Everyone was friendly and pleased to help with even the smallest request. Special mention must be made of Russell Hadley who was truly brilliant; he answered every question in a timely fashion and went the extra mile to make our stay memorable. There were a couple of tiny problems and he ironed them out immediately.
We ate in the hotel a couple of times; the quality was good and the price reasonable. Breakfast was great and set us up for the day. All staff were friendly and the feeling in the hotel was that they really wanted you there and it was a pleasure to help you. This, as we all know, is very unusual in a large hotel, but makes the place very special.
Can’t wait to go back! 5 star service. 5 star for that extra something special.",5,2012,03,21
211,Great out-of-town Hotel,"First a special shout-out to Kat and Ciara at the front desk who were great ambassadors of Ireland and the Hotel.  

We visited during St. Patrick's Day weekend 2012, and there was also a large match going on across the street at Croke Park, so things were very busy at the Hotel.  They were still able to answere every question and accommodate every one of our needs, right down to changing rooms when we found out we were located on the back side of the hotel with the trash trucks (we had a 17-month old in tow).  Rooms are a bit small for a travel crib and trying to move around quietly once the baby goes down, but that's not the hotels fault.
I would spend the extra 20 Euros on the upgraded room...sure they are no bigger, but the convenience of the continental breakfast in the morning and the access to free coffee and water throughout the day was worth it to us.  Also, having internet access in your room made it easier to plan for the days ahead, and map out routes without having to leave your room.  
Room service was speedy and excellent.  
Agree with other posters that this hotel is a good 15 minute walk through town to get to more town, but Dublin probably doesnt claim to be a great walking city.  Free parking was ample and crucial and even with the parade on, we were able to sneak around the outskirts of the city and visit the Guinness factory.  If you want to get out of the city, this is a great location as it is a quick trip to the M50 which takes you around Dublin, and then to the M1/M11 north and south.

The bar area is a great place to mingle with other out of towners and share experiences of the day.  The wait staff is very friendly and quick to refill your Guinness.  They also have a nice selection of beer and spirits if you aren't drinking Guinness.  

Overall an excellent experience.",5,2012,03,21
211,Amazing service plus,"I took a group of 16 to the Croke Park and found the rooms to be VERY nice, way beyond our expectations for the price. The rooms are spacious, modern, comfortable. Then, on top of it, the Irish buffet breakfast the next morning was the best breakfast buffet I've ever had, anywhere in the world. The staff are welcoming and helpful. From the reception desk to the concierge, they took great care of us.",5,2012,03,20
211,new hotel and fantastic service,"stay at this hotel if you want a grown up experience - new furnishings, classy bar and restaurant, comfortable bed and fantastic service.

or...stay at this hotel if you're attending a match at the park across the street.

the hotel had overbooked and placed at another hotel that was also 4/5 on trip advisor.  however, that hotel was only rated so because of the location near temple bar.  it failed in every other way.  we reached out to croke park and cormac, the front officer manager, went above and beyond in making us whole.  we were thrilled to just have a good night's sleep with fluffy pillows, comfortable duvet and walls that act like walls.  we can't sing enough praises of cormac.

true, it's not the ideal location if you're not attending a match but we don't mind partying in another area of town if we can get solid sleep and comfort.  it's an easy cab ride to anywhere in town.",5,2012,03,20
211,"Amazing hotel for the price, definitely coming back!","Stayed over St.Patrick's weekend, can not fault the place.  There was 19 of us staying here for a stag-do and absolutely everyone loved the place, with many saying they'll definitely come back when they return to Dublin.

Everything is first class, loads of space, nice rooms with a massive bathroom, food (breakfasts are superb) and drink is excellent.  Nice (and understanding) staff when were being loud in the bar late at night the staff were great.

Get a taxi into town and back but its only €10 each way and that's only a few quid each when travelling with someone else.  And all travellers know sometimes its the taxi drivers that give you priceless tips and info for the city you are in.  And no, the area is not dodgy at all, would have happily walked.

€129 for a night at this hotel is a bargain, especially when you have three people in the room its really cheap for the quality.  Stay somewhere in the city centre for €100 per night extra if you want but there's really no need.

I'll definitely be back and am looking forward to it.",5,2012,03,20
211,Wonderful,"My husband and I with 2 friends spent two nights at this awesome hotel. The beds were so comfortable, room very clean and the staff was very very nice. We had the breakfast buffet which was so very good with lots of choices. It is close enough to walk to the town center only about 30 minutes. We arrived at 5:30am and they were so kind to let us have our rooms since we had been traveling for almost 20 hours.",5,2012,03,20
211,"Not a great location, but everything else is great","If you are wanting to be downtown, this hotel is quite a walk and there is not much public transportation nearby.  But it is a very nice hotel, with free parking, and a good price and very comfortable beds.",5,2012,03,19
211,More than met expectations,"We were here for St Patricks Day , 2010, (I'm late in my review) and Croke Park was exactly what we needed.  It was private, quiet (even though we faced the street) and had everything we needed.  We never ate here, but visited the bar several times.  The front desk was super helpful in helping us get around Dublin, even hailing taxi's for us.
We stayed here during the last Rugby game held at Croke Park and it was CRAZY but in all the fun ways you could possibly hope.  My only regret is not being able to have that experience again.
I would stay here again in a heart beat!",5,2012,03,16
211,Feb 2012 stay at the lovely Croke Park,"I was more than happy with all aspects of the hotel in terms of cleanliness, friendliness, facilities etc. We had dinner at the Hotel one evening and were impressed by the portions and felt it was reasonable value for money compared to the prices of other Dublin restaurants (Euros 60 for two main meals and a bottle of House Red wine). I would happily recommend this hotel to anyone who doesn't mind a little walk to get into town. 

My only disappointment was when I looked into the price that I paid on a living social deal (£189) and realised that for the Thursday and Friday night that I went, I actually paid more than the online price of the room for the 2 nights. We decided against the Liffy tour and pub crawl that was included in the deal as they didn't really appeal, but even taking the cost of these into account, the offer offered by Croke Park and Living Social didn't really live up to the claim of at least 50% off. 

This aside, I would stay at this Hotel on my next trip to Dublin as it surpassed my expectations in every other respect.",5,2012,03,13
211,We will return,"We stayed in the Croke park hotel on valentines night 2012 with our 3 children aged 15 / 11 and 6, The hotel is fabulous and the staff are some of the friendliest and helpful that we have ever experienced in hotels anywhere in europe or america
The room was a superior room for 5 comprising of 2 double and 1 single bed in a huge room overlooking Croke Park, The room facilities were very good and we had a realy enjoyable stay
The Bar area is quite big and they serve nice bar food /snacks at realy good prices, there is a little library in the reception area and overall we were very impressed and more importantly our children loved the hotel
The breakfast was excelent with a good choice of everything you could want and the staff were lovely
If you are planning a tour of Croke park you get discount on admission prices if you show your keycard from the hotel .
You are within walking distance from Oconnell street and its about €8 in a taxi from Oconnell street back to the Hotel
Overall its a lovely hotel with great staff who make sure that everything is perfect",5,2012,03,11
211,thank you croke park,"i had to stay at this hotel in february as my husband john had to have heart surgery at the mater hospital in dublin, the staff at this hotel made my stay so much easier. from reception to chamber maids from chefs to bar staff!
from the day we arrived to the day we left, the staff were welcoming, friendly and so helpful.
the breakfasts delicious and the fruit juice fresh, the tea and coffee just like home.
i cannot fault this hotel, well only one little point!!! our room was at the back overlooking the canal and back yard, the worker who sorts out the crates etc, seemed to start work a bit early!! but you knew he/she was trying to work as quietly as they could!! we had to get up early anyway so it was no problem.
so thank you croke park for a stress free stay in what could have been a stressfull situation",5,2012,03,09
211,Brilliant first visit,"Booked on basis of good previous reviews and was not disappointed.  All of the staff were phenomenally pleasant and helpful.  We had hot towels on arrival, lovely room (superior) at great price which my wife described as the nicest she had stayed in.  Queries ranging from big (re: ferry issues) to small (getting into town dealt with efficiently but with a sense of humour.  I wouldn't hesitate to recommend to any of my well travelled relatives. Gym small but well equipped.  Great all round.  It really was that good.",5,2012,03,06
211,excellent service,"Our first stay here but wont be the last . My wife and i have had a fantastic weekend break at this wonderful hotel . We would certainly like to give a great thanks to ALL of the staff from cleaners to waiters and waitresses and reception . Was nice to be greeted by all staff with a good morning , and with a smile that was not false . We had no issues whatsoever with anything or anyone . We had a great bedroom with all amenities in top working order . Praise be where due and on this occasion we cannot praise enough .",5,2012,03,06
211,hard to beat in dublin,have stayed in this hotel many times and i can honestly say that it seems to be getting better everytime. We stayed in february and have booked again for april. We have always been met by friendly staff all over the hotel from the receptionists to the cleaners. the breakfast was excellent and the rooms were very clean and the bed very comfortable. a bonus in the large bathroom was a bath and seperate shower as after a day walking around dublin  the bath helped the feet revive. the free car park was also a big bonus and the hotel was very easy to drive to from the m3. yes it is a 15 or 20 mins walk to oconnell street but it is a nice walk after the large breakfast. a taxi from oconnell street cost us 7 euros before 12 at night but probably dearer after 12. but hey you do get the free car park after all. we walked back the secong night of our stay and it was through very quiet streets. i have stayed in loads of hotels in dublin but it would be hard for me to pass the croke park hotel as i love it. please keep up the good work and well done to all the staff they are credit to the hotel.,5,2012,03,05
211,Quality accommodation,"We stayed for one night at the start of March and were very pleased with standard of the Croke Park.  Having booked through an on-line booking company we got a great rate which made it exceptional value.  The rooms were spotless, the staff super and breakfast excellent.  We walked to the city centre which takes about 20 mins - a taxi costs around 10euro. Secure car parking is free for residents which is also a bonus.  One downside was the cost of a small glass of wine - 7euro - but this was the only 'complaint' I would have.",5,2012,03,04
211,Easy & uncomplicated,"All other reviews abt this hotel still holds true. Warm towels, water bottles etc. 20 min walk to both Tara street or Connelly station. But 10 euros in a cab or take the hop on hop of bus. We took the cab and were rewarded with 2 excellent drivers who suggested visiting certain places- we did and was great. This is o d of the best places to stay. Lovely hotel will stay again. ",4,2012,03,03
211,"Top class hotel, top class staff..","stayed here with a friend at the weekend. we were after a relaxing, stress free time, theatre and a little sight seeing, which is exactly what we got. the rooms were spotless and beds very comfortable.
every member of the hotel staff can be commended on their professionalism and courteous manner. they were friendly and genuine and made us feel more than welcome.
breakfast was very nice and dinner was excellent.
we were very happy with the location, in fact it was a lovely 10/15 minute walk to o' connell street. we normally stay in a more central hotel for the night life, but for the price of a short taxi drive I'll be staying here in future.
highly recommend it.",5,2012,03,02
211,"Location, Service, Quality and Value for Money","Location: Croke Park Hotel is located between Dublin airport and the city centre, 5 minutes walk from the Drumcondra bus stop on the 16A bus line, which is a direct local bus line between O'Connell street (the city centre) and Dublin Airport.  A taxi ride to the airport on a heavy traffic day was €22.  The hotel is served by a shuttle bus that takes you directly to the start of the Dublin Bus sightseeing tour, which is a great way not only to get to the major attractions, but also for getting around in the city, before you get to know the regular bus network.  I would recommend you get multi-day tickets for both the Dublin Bus Tour and for the regular Dublin Bus.  The hotel itself is in a quiet street with close to no noise.

Service: The staff was friendly, always helpful, flexible, present but never intrusive.  Perfect.

Quality: We booked a Standard Family Room.  What we got was not the usual double room with a couple of child beds tucked into a limited space, but a spacious room with two full-size double beds, a desk, three bedside tables and another table+chair, tv set, radio/cd-player, plenty of clothes space, ironing board, hair drier, mini-bar.  Plus a spacious bathroom with large shower cabin and a separate bath tub.   All clean and neatly decorated.  

Because we had pre-paid the room, no credit card was required for check-in.  So by default pay-services and mini-bar was inaccessible, which is kind of nice when you have kids in the room and don't want to tempt them with a rich mini-bar.  

The public areas were separated in such a way that we actually felt like hanging out in the lobby, tv room or restaurant for a while.   Breakfast was very nice, and the few dishes we tried for dinner were also great.  I can recommend the beef guinness.

This is one of the cheapest hotels I have stayed in, so I was surprised to discover that it was also the best.

Also, I could not have enough of Dublin and the Irish, and I am even planning to celebrate St. Patrick's Day this year...

Negative: That I can't go back to Croke Park Hotel until next year, I have no more holiday left...",5,2012,03,01
211,Excellent,"I stayed here with my partner in January.   All the staff were polite, friendly, efficient and helpful.  The room was immaculately clean with lots of attention to detail.  Dinner in the restaurant was excellent, as was the breakfast.   Very comfortable bed and a lovely quiet night's sleep.
Location is only a 10-15 minute walk to O'Connell Street, so an ideal location for sight seeing.
I would highly recommend staying here.",5,2012,02,28
211,"Modern, excellent, friendly hotel, although not ideal location","On first impression as you enter the hotel it is modern, friendly and 4 star rating and this continues throughout the hotel.  I could not fault this hotel.  The staff are friendly, the rooms are spacious, clean with excellent facilities in the room, incl cd player, mini bar, iron, toiletries, air conditioning, seperate shower, tea making, hairdryer.  The rooms are sound proofed and the hotel is in a quiet location (well no games were on at Croke Park when we stopped).    We spent 2 nights here and the atmosphere is so lovely in the hotel that we came back early to enjoy our evenings of beer and cocktails (and prices are reasonable, with weekend cocktails only 7euros).  There is a large tv screen, cosy sofas and a welcoming modern flame fire.  

Breakfast was well presented and plenty of choice and the service was excellent, there must be 1 member of staff to every table, clearing away, constantly topping tea pots and milk pots and refilling toast  up when we ran low.

The only downside to this hotel is the location, it isn't in a very nice part of Dublin and first impression was not too good when we walked to the main streets, which are a good 20 minute walk and Temple Row 30 mins away.   Taxis are quite expensive, around 10 euros but you might want to consider this as we did not feel very safe walking back at night!

Trip was booked through Travel Republic......bargain for £198 for 2 including flights and 2 nights accommodation and breakfast

Overall - first class hotel, poor location",5,2012,02,27
211,very professional,"My partner and I stayed in this hotel in february as a birthday celebration. Everything in the hotel was perfect. 

We flew to Dublin and was very easy to get to the hotel (take local buses, cheaper and no need to go to the city center to get to the hotel). We asked for a early check in cause we had to start the journey early in the morning and also as a nice gesture to my partner. When we arrived we got it as we asked. Was very nice touch and we also had a banner saying ""Happy Birthday"" and some balloons. This are the things that make the hotel special. 

We never had dinner or lunch in the restaurant so cannot say anything about it. About the room, everything was perfect. Due to previous jobs I have to say that I always check every single detail, and to be honest, couldn't find anything to complain. The tissue box was set up as a rose which was very nice. I always wondered how long would it take them to make it so perfect. 

The reception staff was always smiley and willing to help. We had a little issue upon arrival with our minibar not been replaced from previous guests and they dealed with it in a very professional way. I thing that is what it matters at the end. 

The only bad thing I could say is that it is not very close to the city center as I read before arriving to the hotel. Yes, you get to the city center in 10 min, but to the shopping part, not the touristy part. But the service you get mades up for the walking distance.",5,2012,02,27
211,"Modern, Clean, Lovely Rooms","Stayed here for a weekend away in Dublin. Loved every aspect of this hotel. (well except for its location , just a little of the beaten track ie Grafton Street ). Great sized and cosy rooms . Lovely lobby, Very helpfull staff. I recommend it to everybody",5,2012,02,26
211,Top quality hotel,"We stayed in this hotel last week for a concert at the O2.  The hotel is top quality and has great staff.  On arrival we were met by a friendly receptionist who booked us in, there was a porter who offered to take our bags which added to the luxury of the hotel and staff treated us with respect.  The room we went for was the superior rooms which were very large and immaculately presented.  The bathroom was a very good size and very clean.  We could not find any fault with the hotel, it is in a good area and very quiet at night.  The rooms are sound proof you really get a good night sleep.  The parking was free of charge, the hotel bar was large and had a good atmosphere.  We will be back here again that is for sure.",5,2012,02,24
211,Excellent again,"My husband and I went  to Dublin and stayed in the Croke Park Hotel to celebrate our Ruby Wedding Anniversary.  This was our second visit and once again we were not disappointed, especially as our son had told them about our anniversary and arranged for wine and chocolates to be left in the room, the hotel gave us an upgrade as well, it was lovely.
The room was comfortable and clean, the bathroom had seperate bath and walk-in shower, free internet and tea and coffee.  There was no noise from the corridors or adjacent rooms,
We had dinner in the restaurant, excellent service and lovely food.  The breakfast had lots of hot and cold food, the sausages were delicious. 
Tea, coffee and toast were brought to the table by friendly staff.
O'Connell Street is about twenty minutes walk away, but Temple Bar is nearer thirty minutes, although a taxi is about ten Euros.  The hotel is very easy to find when arriving by ferry.",5,2012,02,23
211,Family friendly all it needs is a pool,"Great hotel, we stayed there twice in jan: on arrival to ireland and on departure. The rooms opposite Croke Park are much larger than the back which was too small for a family of five.
Room service was quick food was great, staff in restaurant where friendly, Concierge very helpful, loved the free bottles of water each morning.",4,2012,02,22
211,good location secure parking wonderful hotel,"One night stay with breakfast with 3 children, very impressed from the minute we checked in to our leaving next day,  rooms spacious and beds most comfortable, very quiet.  Staff very helpful and friendly nothing too much trouble for them.  Would highly recommend this hotel.",5,2012,02,20
211,Weekend stay - a joyous experience,"My wife, her sister and husband and I stayed at the Croke Park Hotel last weekend as a weekend special break. We stayed in the deluxe rooms and all I can say is that the Croke Park Hotel lives up to its Tripadvisor ratings. It was first class, the evening meal and the breakfasts were beautiful, staff were very helpful, the comfort of the bed and the room decor were all faultless. Perhaps not that convenient to the centre of Dublin but don't let that deter you from booking into the Croke Park hotel. I have stayed in the Hilton Kilmainham and the Ashling Hotel and the Croke Park Hotel beats them both - although they were also very good",5,2012,02,20
211,Spotless,"My daughter and I spent a night in The Croke Park hotel for the mid term break. We got it for a great price and it was worth every penny.I am very fussy but it was spotless. Breakfast was great and they even had soya milk. The only failing the hotel has is the area isnt great, but a 15 minute walk and you are at the bottom of O Connell Street. We didnt get the hot towels or bottled water but at the rate we got it for I didnt mind",4,2012,02,20
211,the second worst i have  ever stayed in,"what can i say from the staff disinterest -  no one in reception and a queue had formed. when a lady did appear to answer a phone, proceeded to  take call, hang up and wander away. A scene which was replicated in the bistro. After 20 minutes waiting for a desert menu i gave up and paid for my main course. it seemed more important for five staff to cluster around and do the exact same job. i assume that if i had the patience i would be waiting yet. There were drunk people wandering up and down the hall outside the rooms knocking  on doors and trying to find the other people of there party. i came home needing a day off to recover from 2 hours sleep and a 3 hr drive home.  the only positive thing i can say was there was a truly professional man working behind reception. about the only thing professional i found during my stay",2,2012,02,20
211,Excellent for a family weekend.,"We stayed for two nights as a family (2 adults 2 children)

Awesome lobby area. Restaurant and bar are excellent open spaces with great bar/restaurant combinations. Kids loved it. Its busy, verging on hectic, but a real family atmosphere. Just what an Irish hotel should be.

Had dinner in hotel one night, was very busy, but staff got to us quickly and food was well liked by all.

Breakfast was incredibly busy, but a great spread, and no problems at all.

Room was lovely, would have preferred slightly larger, but all superior rooms had gone by time we booked. 

Value for money the hotel is a real winner. Would definitely return.

Staff were really friendly too. Concierge was very proactive and welcoming.

Only real niggle was the mini bar, whoever had been in the room before us had left their groceries. Housekeeping hadn't picked up on this so stuff had moulded. Should really have been picked up. Oh and ironingboard kept collapsing, but kids loved the entertainment value of that, very slapstick.",4,2012,02,20
211,over-night stay in a fantastic hotel!,"I stayed here here with my mother and sister for one night, in a family room. The room was very clean, very spacious and the amenties were great; flat screen tv with a number of channels, music system, tea & coffee facilities, mini bar (the items were reasonably priced!), body lotions, shampoos, bubble bath, magazines, safe, iron, ironing board, alot of hanging and shelf space, a dresser and a seperate table and chairs. We ate dinner in the hotel bar. There was alot of choice and they were even willing to make dishes that weren't on the menu. We also had breakfast the next morning. It was a buffet and I have never seen a spread like it before, full irish, and also a continental, which ranged from croissants, fruit, cereal, cheeses and meats. The staff were really helpful. The people on reception organised all the taxis for us, brought us extra magazines and changed one of the beds sheets due to the fact my mum has an allergic reaction to feather and down covers.
I didnt stay with any young children but this is a great family hotel, there are loads of board games and activities to keep children entertained during any stage of the day or night. 
I stayed at this hotel due to the fact I had a voucher, but I will be returning again to treat myself soon and would recommend it to anyone!!",5,2012,02,20
211,Very good,"This hotel is strategically located directly opposite Croke Park stadium. Excellent if you are visiting for a sports fixture. It gets a bit hectic before matches with throngs of people milling about but it also lends a festive atmosphere to the place. Front desk staff were very helpful, rooms were spacious with a modern airy design. Underground parking is available at no extra cost. Rail and DART services are a 10 minute walk away.",4,2012,02,20
211,Wonderful Stay and beautiful hotel,"From Check in to check out, this hotel is wonderful,  We had a beautiful room and spotless clean,  Quick service, staff really helpful and nothing a problem, staff at this hotel are very good at their jobs and friendly.  You could not find a fault with anything here.  The hot towels at check in to the complimentary water at check out. Regarding service and we have stayed in plenty of hotels and even more luxurious hotels,  this hotel is top of our list for city break and we will definately return and would not even hesitate to recommend hotel.  Food is excellent here too.  Beds very comfortable, we had a wonderful stay.",5,2012,02,19
211,Excellent all-rounder,"This hotel can be very busy at weekends especially if there is a match across the street in Croke Park.  We went mid-week when you will usually get a very good price and a quieter hotel.  The room was a good size and the bed most relaxing. However, the pillows could be softer.  We didn't hear a sound all night. The staff are very friendly and helpful.  The only meal we had was breakfast and this was perfect with an excellent choice, the nicest toast we have ever had and, something I don't recall in any other hotel, a choice of back and streaky (smoked) bacon, delicious.  City centre is 15mins walk away but you probably wouldn't do so late at night.  In addition to a great room rate parking is free, very unusual for a city centre hotel.  Highly recommended.",5,2012,02,19
211,Has the most comfortable beds!,"I stayed in the Croke Park hotel for approximatey a month for work and I have to say it is one of the nicest hotels I have stayed in. The rooms are huge and the bed was the most comfortable of all the hotels I have stayed in. It was a struggle to get out of it in the morning for work! After staying there for a month, they staff came to know our names and were incredibly friendly and helpful with our requests. The food in the restaurant was devine and there was a nice choice in the menu. 

The only negative point is the location. It is approximately a 20 minute walk to the city centre and it is not the best area, particularly late at night. It was, however, perfect for our stay as our conference was in the stadium which is directly across the road.",5,2012,02,17
211,Fantastic Hotel,"Just returned from a weekend at the Croke Park Hotel.  The service is amazing, very friendly staff who cannot do enough for you, the quickest check in I have experienced.  The rooms are huge and are spotless.  Our room rate included full breakfast and the selection was endless, superb.  We also ate in the restaurant one night and it was amazing, again the staff were so helpful and friendly.  The hotel is only a 15 minute walk from the centre and if I return to Dublin I wouldn't stay anywhere else.  If you are planning a trip to Dublin you would be crazy not to stay at this hotel!!",5,2012,02,14
211,AMAZING!,"Had the best hotel experience here last weekend. Fabulous room with a superking size bed, spotlessly clean, attentive staff, excellent value for money. Check in was smoothest ever, thanks Tara!. Got a takeaway as we came out of the theatre late and the hotel arranged for plates and cutlery to be sent up to our room!! Can't wait to go back again!!",5,2012,02,14
211,Amazing Service,"My fiance and I spent last Saturday night at this hotel and we could not fault the service and the food.  
The receptionists were very helpful.
The room was great.
The food in the bistro was amazing.  I would definitely recommend the lamb shank.
The hotel bar was very busy after some games and people were a little boisterous.

The service definitely made up for that though.

We would stay there again.",4,2012,02,13
211,Best Hotel in Dublin,Lovely rooms. Very helpful and friendly staff. Breakfast has everything. We all stayed here for my daughters Hen weekend and it was really lovely. Free parking for guests and all the usual goodies in the bathroom. We got a brilliant offer on Travelrepublic. True Irish Hospitality.  ,5,2012,02,12
211,Excellent Quality Hotel,"We have just returned from Dublin and I would thoroughly recommend this hotel to anyone wishing to stay there.  Our room was very comfortable with a king size bed, bedding was changed daily as were all towels, toiletries were replenished daily and we were very impressed by the service provided.  Our check in was faultless, in fact, the quickest check in we have experienced anywhere.  

Included in the price was a full Irish breakfast together with plenty of choice in the way of cereals, fruit, yoghurts and various compotes and, of course, the full cooked breakfast.  Coffee and toast were served by the waiters at our table and you could request refills which were swiftly delivered.

The conference facilities appeared to be to a high standard although this was not the purpose of our trip.  

The staff were friendly and helpful, very professional and a credit to the hotel.

All in all, I would say that this hotel deserved its high rating and I would definitely return there again.",4,2012,02,10
211,"awesome hotel, directly across from Croke park","Beautiful hotel , stayed there in sept 2009...very great location, good food, and staff very pleasant",5,2012,02,08
211,rugby coach trip,"Well what a w/end ! a fine (but narrow) win by Wales and a near perfect hotel. i don't see the point in repeating many excellent reviews of this hotel, but feel it would be wrong not to mention the hard working,courteous and friendly staff.
To get into the city center just walk to the right on leaving hotel, cross one road and you will come to Mountjoy Square from there you can catch very regular buses into O'connell street for 60 cents (no change given on bus). we caught the number 7 from O'connell street back to Mountjoy Square but gather many other bus numbers travel same route.Taxis cost around 7-10 euro's each way.
We did not sample the hotel food but some mentioned that the bar food and drinks were quite reasonable priced and similar to city center.
Finally being as tactful as i can possibly be could the hotel  management supply a toilet brush, Dublin being the city of Guinness.(i am sure the maid would approve)",5,2012,02,07
211,Fantastic hotel,"Just returned from the Croke Park Hotel we visit this hotel every 2 years for the rugby and this hotel never fails to impress
The staff are so freindly and helpful, the rooms are brilliant, the food is amazing, i could go on forever about this hotel cant wait for our next visit.

I have never been in a hotel where all the staff are so freindly, the breakfast was brilliant every thing was available.

A big thank you to Sean Reid who is the Manager who was as freindly and as helpful as ever",5,2012,02,07
211,AS IMPRESSIVE AS EVER,"We have just returned from a week-end in The Croke Park Hotel and it certainly is as impressive as ever.  Anne Marie in reservations, spoke very courteously to us when we rang about the booking and her telephone manner was exceptional.  She is a true ambassador for the hotel and took the time to chat to us in order that we would be warmly welcomed when we arrived and she ensured that our check-in would be completed without any fuss.
This certainly was the case when we arrived, as Sarah in reception, booked us in within a few minutes.  Again, Sarah ensured that our rooms were allocated as requested and that everthing was in order for the week-end ahead.
We decided to book dinner for the following evening and Helen - the receptionsist at the restaurant desk - portrayed a friendly disposition and welcoming smile.  She mentioned that the restaurant menu would be available on the following morning at noon and she ensured that we received this menu as promised.  The evening meal was a delight to behold and we were treated to a culinary feast as we were spoilt for choice in the restaurant.  Tong - one of the waitresses in the restaurant, was very courteous and ensured that since we had a booking for 8.45, that the meal was brought to the table not a second later. - wow - what service - as good as any in a top-notch 5 star hotel.anywhere in the world.
We were so delighted that Sean - the gentleman who seems to be in charge of everything in the hotel - took the time to welcome us once again to the Croke Park hotel.  His endearing charm, witty remarks and courteousness coupled with his amicable personality certainly goes a long way to ensure that each and every guest are treated with the utmost hospitality and warm-heartedness.  Well done Sean, once again!!!
On Sunday morning we were checked out by the lovel Tara who wished us a safe journey home and not forgetting the efficient concierge Krishna, who hastily validated our car-park ticket - another plus for the Croke Park Hotel - complimentary parking for guests which is very rare in Dublin nowadays.
All in all a very enjoyable week-end - entirely due to the efficiency of the magnificent Staff who go that extra mile to ensure that each and every one of their guests enjoy a relaxing time in the Croke Park Hotel.  Yes - as impressive as ever!!!!  Well done to all!!",5,2012,02,06
211,Lovely stay - everything we needed,"Had a lovely weekend here in January 2012 - we were allowed to check in early which was great. Fantastic, spacious room with everything we needed. Bathroom was great - very light with a bath and a double shower which meant we were spoiled for choice. Breakfast had a superb choice of hot cooked food and a selection of continental meats/cheese/cereal/fruit etc. Staff very friendly. Would highly recommend the tour of Croke Park just across the road - 10% off if you are staying in the Croke Park hotel. 
Not in the centre of the city but only a 5-10 minute walk which was absolutely fine for us as you get to see a lot more of the city rather than just the main streets! Guiness storehouse a great visit also - highly recommend a trip there. Temple bar of course was brilliant for lots of drinks and traditional music! Overall a great weekend - fab hotel and great city.",5,2012,02,02
211,short break at the croke park hotel dublin,"we have just returned from a short break at the Croke park hotel.this is a very nice hotel,about 15 Min's walk from the town centre,the room was excellent,with a large bed, TV and mini bar.the bath room was superbly clean,as was the room, and the rest of the hotel.the food at the restaurant was excellent,the breakfast was also very good.the staff were very helpful and friendly.we went on a travelzoo top twenty deal,and would definitely stay here again.i would recommend this hotel highly.",4,2012,02,01
211,Solid 4 star hotel,"We are just back from a weekend break in this hotel, which we really enjoyed. It was part of a voucher deal, but I would've booked irrespectively. Friendly staff from arrival till we left, we were even given a complimentary bottle of bubbles soon after we got to our room - a lovely treat. We then headed to the bar which was lively. Breakfast buffet - hot and cold - was always busy but well stocked and a good variety. 

The rooms were well equipped   - big comfy beds, although the memory foam pillows took a while to get used to. Large and well light modern bathrooms. 

It's a short walk into the city centre and only 10 minutes from the airport - we got a taxi for around 25 euros. There is not much around the hotel so you must be prepared to walk into town or to get a taxi.",4,2012,01,30
211,Very good stay,"I must say we had a wonderful stay at The Croke Park Hotel. Upon arrival we were greeted with a friendly (and attractive) front desk lady who gave us some face towels and had us checked in within a minute. Our room was reasonably spacious, and had Sky Sports. What a treat.

The shower was average and we didn’t try the bath. The bathroom itself was very nice, spacious and clean. The beds were very comfortable, and we even had an extra single bed in our room as well as our double.

There was a shuttle bus from the hotel to the open-top bus tour of Dublin. Tickets can be bought from the concierge at a very reasonable price of 14Euros each.

Breakfast was a great choice of your usual cooked sausage egg etc and cereals, fruits and ham and cheeses. You also got a newspaper free if you wished.

The bar area was spacious, drinks very reasonably priced, and they kindly let us have a Baileys each when we got in very late from a night out when the bar was closing.
Cabs from the airport are about 25Euros and cabs into Temple Bar are between 10-15Euros.
Most of all, all the staff there was excellent. I can’t recommend the hotel enough.

Thanks to all teh staff",4,2012,01,26
211,Good Hotel,"Boyfriend took me to Dublin for my 25th Birthday.  Hadnt really seen much of the hotel but knew it had brilliant reviews on trip advisor.  Wasnt disappointed. Lovely hotel nice friendly staff and drinks were reasonably priced although the same cant be said for the rest of Dublin. The hotel was clean and bed was big and comfy.  bathroom was clean spacious with seperate shower and bathtub which is always a plus! We were on 4th floor which is executive floor and you get use of the private room> breakfast wasnt really to our liing as we would have preferred full irish and they only provided continental. Would probably be good for business use but not for what we wanted after a night on the cobbles.

Location was pretty good 15 minute walk into the centre. Little far out but we didnt mind walking. 

All in all I would recommend this hotel",4,2012,01,24
211,Excellent,"Stayed here one night, wasnt expecting too much as the price was very reasonable.
we found the hotel very well located-we were going to a concert in the o2,
the hotel room was exceptionally clean and to a very high standard, Staff were very friendly and Efficent.
The only downside was not having a Residents bar, Otherwise a great hotel.",4,2012,01,23
211,city break,"A trip to visit molly malone, picked this offer up in the irish news, ab fab.
Lovely hotel, walking distance to dublin city centre.  Food good, Bar food very reasonable.
Staff very helpful.  Critically good free parking.
Excellent choice and value",5,2012,01,23
211,Lovely hotel,"The reception staff on our arrival couldn't have been nicer and more efficient.  Our room was lovely, bathroom huge with separate shower and bath. Spotless.  Great secure parking.  Our only gripe was the bar staff.  We had to wait 30 minutes for toasted sandwiches.  Then my husband was told that there was no residents bar but we could order drinks to our room later.  I then asked at reception and was told that there was no problem for residents to order drinks that the bar would be manned until at least 3am.  At 1am we tried to order drinks from the bar staff who said no the bar was closed.  Ended up ordering from the night porter who in turn got them from the bar! very strange but didn't take away from a lovely hotel.",5,2012,01,23
211,Not an average hotel,"I wasn't expecting too much of this hotel, as it wasn't very expensive (thinking of Holiday Inn style average hotel). 

Rooms:
We got a room on the fourth floor (""executive floor""). This entitled us to a free buffet breakfast (hot breakfasts not included), which we could have either downstairs in the main breakfasting area, or in a smaller area on the 4th floor. This same area was used as a snack bar (tea, coffee, juice, water and fruit mainly) that we had access to 24 hrs a day. We also got one complimentary drink each at the hotel restaurant/bar. One complaint I have is that the 4th floor breakfast area was closed for 2 of the mornings we were there, and we had to go down to the lobby anyway, so it negated the convenience of having a breakfast area on the same floor. (PS check whether breakfast is included when you book the room!)

The room itself was well furnished and clean with a massive bed! It was turned down every evening for us and was equipped with bathrobes and slippers and had a room safe. Bathroom was nice and clean as well and had a bath and shower. 

Service:
No complaints about the service at this hotel. Receptionists were courteous and friendly, bar/restaurant staff were very attentive and room service staff stellar. Great service all round!

Food:
I found the food here surprisingly good! We had some sandwiches in the bar for lunch one day and although they were just sandwiches, they were done very well. The burgers we had were also good, but the best part were the chips. They were delicious! The Irish sure know how to cook their potatoes!

Location:
I've seen a few people complain about the location and that it was too far from the city centre. Rubbish. Getting to Croke Park from the airport was 25 minutes on the commuter bus (about 4 euros), and the stop is 5 minutes walk from the hotel. Getting to the city centre only cost 1.20 euro and is 10 minutes on the bus. Easy peasy. One drawback of the commuter bus is that you need exact change (but if you've paid too much the bus driver will give you a refund voucher which you can redeem at the bus office in the main street). 
The area is also not that bad. It seems a little industrial, but is pretty quiet (although we were not there while an event was on at the stadium).

Complaints:
I only have two complaints about our stay. One, the 4th floor breakfast area was closed on two of the mornings we were there and so we had to go down to the main breakfast hall, which negates the convenience of this little perk. Secondly, the walls are very thin. I could hear what the couple next door were getting up to very clearly!

All in all, this hotel was great value for money and far exceeded my expectations. Thank you, Croke Park Hotel!",4,2012,01,20
211,"beautiful hotel, would highly recommend","Stayed in this beautiful hotel for 1 night only. loads of free parking. check in was quick, staff very friendly and effecient. Room was lovely, bed was very comfortable. Bathroom had seperate shower and bath. 
Had dinner in the bar, it was good quality food and was very reasonably priced. breakfast was lovely with plenty of choice!

211,"Gorgeous Hotel , Wonderful Staff .","We were lucky enough to spend 4 Fabulous nights at this superb Hotel and hopefully its the 1st of many visits.
  The staff were so friendly and nothing was too much trouble. Our room was large very well equipped and the bathroom top class . perfectly clean and refreshing in every way. Breakfast was extensive , the best of everything Irish and Continental . The 3 course evening meal was also very impressive and is highly recommended.Location is perfect for anyone who enjoys a 20 minute walk into the City, or for those who prefer public transport there are many buses just about on the doorstep.",5,2012,01,11
211,Top Class 4 Star Hotel,"I stayed over the weekend with my family as we were going to Jedward Pantomine in the Olympia.  It is a very impressive hotel with excellent employees. We were allowed check in very early - no problem. Rooms are large (even by American standards), modern, well appointed and very comfortable - bathroom was similar - absolutely spotless.  The buffet breakfast was freshly cooked and plentiful.  Location is quite good - about a 15 minute walk into the city centre (€10 taxi ride). The hotel employees are very professional, friendly and attentive - congratulations! In summary, for the price paid, our expectations were exceeded.",5,2012,01,10
211,Very nice.,"Very close to the Ferry terminal and free parking in an underground garage.  The restaurant was nice and friendly service.  The room was clean and had plenty of towels.  We had a family room, which included two double beds and a twin bed.  Very modern decor.",5,2012,01,10
211,"A fantastic weekend, thanks Croke Park!!!","We stayed here for 2 nights on the travelzoo offer and what great value it was!! The hotel was amazing. The beds were so comfortable and huge!!! Dinner was fantastic; the quality of food was absolutely out of this world!! I recommend the steak with handmade peppercorn sauce. Breakfast was 1st class as well. There really was nothing to complain about. Staff was really friendly and very helpful. As it was a birthday we were celebrating the hotel had decorated our room with balloons and a birthday banner. We were also given a complimentary desert which was decorated with a candle – a lovely touch!
I would recommend this hotel to anyone who was going to Dublin. It was a pleasant stroll into the city centre which we enjoyed every morning. I can’t find anything bad to say about this hotel 10/10!!!!",5,2012,01,09
211,a nice hotel in Dublin,"We ended our 7 days in Ireland with 2 nights at the Croke - it is a clean, modern hotel with everything you might expect from such.  We couldn't get the in-room LAN cable to work (there is no wi-fi outside the lobby) and from sitting in the lobby, heard other people calling to complain about the same.  It was fine though, sitting in the lobby which is comfortable and relaxed.  The bathroom was large and very nice with a tub and separate large shower, the beds are comfortable and the service at the front desk extremely friendly.  The best part of the hotel is its location across the street from the Croke Park stadium - we went on the tour and loved it.  Not only is the tour very cool but the interactive museum is a blast, even for three 30-somethings.  The walk from this hotel into downtown Dublin is only about 10-15 minutes along safe roads.",4,2012,01,09
211,Great Hotel,"We stayed here in Nov'11 for three nights. Our room was lovely and spacious, we loved the small fridge it was so handy.we went for our anniversary and the staff had put up balloons and a banner in our room, a lovely touch the attention to detail. the staff were very nice and chatty especially in the restaurant where we ate one night.we look forward to our next trip.P.S the free car parking in Dublin is a huge bonus.well done on not ripping us off.",4,2012,01,05
211,Welcomed though early,"We stayed at The Croke as part of our package with Septre Tours. We began and ended our 7 day vacation with a night here. When we arrived after our initial flight in we were very early and were still greeted warmly and pleasantly and given a room right away. The hotel is modern with several European touches (light fixtures and TV access) that intrigued us. Staff was very friendly and knowledgeable about bus schedules and sights. Breakfast was more than just ""continental"".",5,2012,01,05
211,A Quality Modern Hotel,"Stayed for 2 nights over the the new year with partner and 3 year old kid,The Croke Park  is a very well run Hotel with friendly and helpful staff,there is a large comfortable bar/restaurant/breakfast area across from the reception desk.The big plus for me was the secure free underground parking for guests given that can be hard to find in a Central Dublin
area....a few minutes drive and your into the very centre of the city.The room (Double & a Single bed ) was comfortable,facilites included Air-Con,hairdryer,minifridge, flat screen tv(with Sky Sports & Setanta free included !)
Overall I would recommend the croke park hotel especially for a couples/family stay.",4,2012,01,05
211,the best hotel in ireland !,"Stayed here for new years 2011, and has the best time. brilliant location, with only a ten min walk into town. would stay here again that for sure.",5,2012,01,03
211,"Nice hotel, good location",Very nice room and the staff was lovely.  Easy walk to O'Connell Street -- would definitely recommend!,4,2012,01,01
211,Cracking Hotel,"Stayed here for business conference in Dublin city centre in September 2010 and was pleasantly surprised. Came back in August 2011 for a weekend with my wife - it was All Ireland Hurling Semi Final and we were amazed at the low price available. For a small fee increase on arrival the Deluxe Room was excellent, with ample light breakfast from Exec Room to start the day. Staff were excellent - helpful and pleasant to give a welcoming touch. Bar staff were superb :- even apres-match with the whole hotel overflowing with Dublin and Tipperary fans. Such a good experience we're back for wedding anniversary first weekend in January! Yes it is slightly out of city centre, but the area is fine. If in doubt at night the 10 Euro taxi from city centre is answer, but we had great fun on the no.123 Bus directly in and out of Temple Bar if you are preapred for a short stroll along the Canal. Would recommend to anyone - looking forward to many trips here.",4,2011,12,28
211,Perfect Hotel - Perfect location,"What a delightful place to stay, safe underground parking, a pleasant 15 minute walk into O'Connell street. 
Great deal using the alpharooms website.
Upon arrival hot towels were given to us, the room was superb, double shower, lovely
bath and a nice recliner chair.
Ate in the Bar, and again the food was lovely and good value for such a prestigious place.
Breakfast was also excellent and all staff were very attentive. Can't wait to return",5,2011,12,24
211,Very comfortable hotel,"Finished to high standards and relatively new, stayed here for two weeks,
Very hospitable and friendly staff, good breakfast decent enough Gym. 

Very generous sized rooms with all modern conveniences, nice breakfast

Good proximity to airport and has underground parking which is great.

Only drawback is there are very few places to eat around the hotel so you have to go into city if you dont want to eat in the hotel restaurant",4,2011,12,22
211,Good location and services,"I like my stay very much. Everything was good.Especially  I like your price for that time :) If serious, I like the location of the hotel, cosy room, also staff was very friendly.",4,2011,12,22
211,Soulless,"Just back from 1 night in croke park hotel. It is a fairly standard member of large hotel chain. Couple of small issues with our stay. Desk Power was out, so we were waiting a while for check in. Room was an ok size, view of a brick wall. Shower leaked onto the floor. No conditioner, no safe, no wifi in rooms. Hairdryer was 2000watts, so pretty good. 

We ate dinner there. It was ok. Average only. Steak, rare, was fairly stringy. Desserts were all premade and from the fridge. 

Staff were all friendly, and very helpful.",3,2011,12,19
211,Comfortable Stay with Good Service,"My girlfriend and I stayed 2 nights here at there beginning of our Ireland vacation.  We arrived about 10 am (several hours before checkin) and were able to get into our room right away.  This was very helpful after a transatlantic flight!  The room was nicely appointed, though the double + single bed arrangement was a little odd.  The bathroom was large with a modern appearance.  Breakfast was included in our package and had a great selection of American and European options.  Parking was complimentary with the reservation.  The location (north of the river) is a little outside the main tourist area (south of the river), though not too far to be a hinderance.  I can't comment on the price, as this was part of our overall travel itinerary booked through Spectre Tours.",4,2011,12,18
211,Will definitely return!,"I booked this hotel as it is literally just steps away from Croke Park Corporate Entertainment- the Naughty but Nice Ball is currently running there pre-Christmas. Booking on the hotels own website is expensive, but if you do a search, it's easy enough to find booking agencies offering better prices...I used a UK website, onhotels.com; they had the best price.

There is a big, open reception desk, which was well manned. The girl who checked me in had to deal with a lengthy call in the middle of check in, but made sure that she got someone else to complete my paperwork so I was not left standing there.

The rooms are lovely; warm, comfortable, well furnished. My ensuite had the nicest and best shower I've seen in a long time; plus a bath, plus all the other little essentials in a bathroom. There was a full sound system, a full size LCD TV, a full sized and very good hairdryer - I am often frustrated by the Mickey Mouse type of hairdryer supplied in hotel rooms! In fact, everything was full sized, including the kettle. My room had no view to speak of - a vacant lot- but it was super quiet, which is what I had asked for.

I lunched in the bar, ordering just a chicken sandwich as I was having a full meal later that evening. The bar service is excellent; staff polite but not too formal, and my bar table was fully set! The simple sandwich arrived bursting with good quality ingredients, and a little handful of dressed salad. It had been freshly made for me, and did not come from a packet.
 Back to that shower....full on powere shower, with a big shower head to give a full energising flow of hot water...I didn't want to get out!
As I was meeting friends, we had arranged to meet in the bar at 7pm. When we arrived, the bar was heaving with what looked like the aftermath of a wedding; however, there were at least four staff behind the bar who dealt with a noisy and impatient crowd with great patience and good humour. We had to take our drinks out to the foyer, as the bar was standing room only. The foyer is huge, with room to sprawl out on very comfy sofas.

I slept extremely well, and my room price included a buffet breakfast next morning. Again, very professional approach, with my order for tea and toast being taken immediately I sat down. And once again, plenty of staff. Buffet breakfast is quite extensive, with everything you could possibly want from continental to full Irish, and more.

Check out is smooth and hassle free; and the young man checking me out geninely seemed interested in whether I had enjoyed my stay. Strictly speaking, it is not a city centre hotel; it's about 15-20 minutes walk to the city centre, but it's well worth considering if staying in Dublin, especially as the underground car parking is complimentary for guests.",4,2011,12,15
211,"Good Hotel, Not So Good Location","My wife and I spent two nights at The Croke Park Hotel in Dublin. We took a bus from the airport to the hotel and it was a short three block walk. The reception was awesome we arrived about 5 hours before check in time and we were cheerfully greeted and given warm towels to freshen up. Luckily they were able to accommodate our early arrival and we were given our room immediately. The room was very nice and very large. The only complaint we had with the hotel was the location. It was a little further outside the city center than we would have liked. Also it does not seem like it sits in the best part of Dublin, it can get a little shady after dark. However it is a short inexpensive cab ride from the city center back to the hotel. Overall this is a very nice hotel with a very friendly and accommodating staff!",4,2011,12,14
211,5 star hotel,Beautiful hotel rooms were spacious had everything you needed.Breakfast was fantastic sorry i could not stay another another night.Will definitely return one of the best hotels i have stayed in.,5,2011,12,14
211,Gorgeous Hotel,"Just back from a weekend stay at the croke park. We were on a travelzoo deal with included an evening meal in the restaurant, free drink and tickets to the guinness store house. The first thing I have to mention is the staff they are so friendly and very attentive, on check in we had hot towels, the following day at reception they gave us hot chocolate and when we left bottles of water. The cleaners even left chocolates when they cleaned our room. The waiter we had during an evening meal was lovely and I didn't have to refill my glass once. The food was lovely and the breakfast was amazing! Buffett style either a cooked breakfast, or fruit, cereals, ham and cheese, breads and pastries. We ate so much that we didn't need to eat again until our evening meal.
The room was gorgeous and the bed was huge the most comfortable bed I have ever slept in, the bathroom was very big and had a seperate walk in shower and bath. The rooms are very well equipped with trouser press, iron and ironing board, mini bar, safety deposit box, flat screen tv, hairdryer and cd player.

It isn't close to the centre however it didn't affect our trip and taxi's to the centre were between 8 and 10 euro. I hope that one day I will return to the croke park.",5,2011,12,12
211,Great Location,"Stayed at this hotel for 2 weeks in November.  The hotel is in a great location, across the road from Croke Park Stadium and only a 15 minute walk to O'Connell Street.  The car park is free which is an added bonus.  Stayed in a deluxe room and the room had wireless.  Breakfast had a good choice of full Irish breakfast or if you wanted a healthier option there is fruit and continental style also available.  We ate in both the bar and the restaurant and all food was really good.  There are also restaurants and bars within walking distance of the hotel.  There is a business center with printer and photocopier available.  Staff were very helpful and nice.  I will stay here again.",5,2011,12,11
211,Charming Hotel for Business or Pleasure.,"I've been coming to Dublin for work for the past decade and love this hotel. I have to travel here twice a year so I have become pretty fond of the Croke over the years. They have the best staff, constantly going above and beyond. Rooms are a delight to be in and the location is fantastic.",5,2011,12,11
211,Excellent stay in Dublin,"My wife and I decided to take a quick trip to Ireland. We picked the Croke Park based upon the reviews on Tripadvisor and other sites. The good reviews were right on. We were greeted very nicely upon arrival and promptly given our room even though the posted check in time was still hours away. The room was comfortable, clean and spacious. It was our first time in Ireland so we were out early and back late and ending up eating at the hotel 3 nights and the food and service was very good.
While the hotel is about 15 minutes to Oconnell street if you don't mind being on the outskirt of the downtown area I don't know if you will find a better place to stay and at a reasonable price. I higly recommend the Croke Park",5,2011,12,09
211,Tip top hotel.,"The reviews said it was good,but it far surpassed our expectations.  

The hotel does detail well and at every stage of our stay we were nicely surprised. On arrival we were offered the opportunity to freshen up with warm flannels.  The bedroom  was spacious and had everything you need - a large double bed, bath and separate shower, dressing gowns and slippers, mini bar, tea & coffee making facilities, TV and stereo.  

Dinner at the hotel's Side Bistro was excelllent and the breakfast was plentiful, fresh and of quality....it kept us going all day.

The hotel is a 15 min walk to the top of O'Connell Street.  We actuallyenjoyed the walk as it helped to walk off breakfast and also allowed you to escape the hustle andbustle of the city centre.  

On friday evening we were nicely surprised by the arrival of solo singer/ guitar player who entertained us with array of classic covers which made a nice end to a lovely evening.

On the whole, the hotel is clean, contemporary and offers quality accommodation.  it may be a bit of a walk to the centre of dublin, but we found the 15minute walk ensured that we had a quiet, uninterrupted sleep.  the staff at the hotel  are very accommodating, cortueous and efficient.  It's a great hotel.

Two tips for a minibreak to dublin - 

1 - use the aircoach to get from the airport into dublin,.  12euro return
2 - use a tour bus to get around the city.  16euro 2 day pass
3 - make sure you visit the guinness storehouse, and allow plenty time as you can easily spend 3 or 4 hours and that's before you enjoy a pint of the black stuff at the gravity bar - great panaramic view of the city.",5,2011,12,04
211,one of the best in dublin,"dont miss a stay in this hotel. the rooms , the food , the staff and the ambience make for one of the best stays in any hotel in ireland i have stayed in. ask for an upgrade to a executive room and enjoy the little add on's like 24hour executive lounge with water , tea , coffee and continental breakfast at your disposal. why eat out the food here is on a par with any good restaurant in dublin, you will not be dissappointed. yes o'connell street is not outside the door but a 15 - 20 leisurely stroll and you are in the heart of dublin.
just try it onece and i assure you, you will return. thanks sean and all the staff for a great weekend.",5,2011,12,04
211,"Great Hotel, first class service","Returned today from a 2 night short break at The Croke Park Hotel. This is a fantastic hotel and the staff are excellent. We were on a Travel Zoo deal but this made no difference to the way we were treated. The rooms are clean and comfy, the breakfast is to die for!! We had a loverly meal on our first night and I even had a candle in my banoffe pie as it was my birthday! All the staff are polite, friendly and nothing is to much. We had a fantastic time in Dublin which was made even more special by the staff who gave us first class service.",5,2011,12,01
211,Christmas Shopping trip,"This hotel was quite adequate for the purpose it was booked.  The hotel was fine but if you're looking for cosy then this is not the hotel for you.  It is more than ideal if you are coming to Dublin to go to Croke Park as it is right across the street, in fact our room was overlooking the main entrance.  It is extremely clean if not a little clinical.  The restaurant was fine but the food was not great in the Restaurant at night.  The bar area is very big so if you can't get a ticket in Croker then this is the place to be as it  has a huge screen to watch the matches.  The car park is underground and was packed when arrived so much so that we had to remove crates and tables and chairs in the car park just to get a space (I think in this instance we arrived at a bad time as it was quite empty on the Sunday when we left, with plenty of spaces).  The reception staff were quite pleasent and efficient but we did not get any hot towels when we arrived which did not matter to us.  The room had everything you could want in a hotel room, iron & ironing board, safe, great entertainment system, teas and coffees, air conditioning etc.  The best thing about the room was the bathroom which had a separate shower (really good shower at that) which was quite unusual for a hotel room.  The bad thing in the room for us was the beds, (we had two doubles) and they were quite hard and small.  You can walk from this hotel but if you turn left at the hotel and left again (as to go to the back of the hotel) you get onto the Drumcondra road where you can get the 16 or 16A bus into town.  The breakfast in the morning was really good with all the usual for a buffet breakfast both the full Irish and continental.  All in all a fine hotel but not the cosiest.",3,2011,11,29
211,Fantastic Hotel with excellent staff,"We travelled to Dublin in November 2011 for a short break.  I had never been to Dublin and wasn’t too sure what to expect but the hotel was outstanding.  I’ve stayed in many hotels and this was certainly one of the best.  Everything was well presented, the rooms were immaculate, as were the common areas.  

All staff were particularly friendly and accommodating and I can certainly rank them amongst the best I’ve ever encountered.  Every single member of staff from the General Manager (who served us at check in) to the Cleaners were cheerful, helpful, courteous and proficient.  We were provided with detailed information about the surrounding area on request from very knowledgeable Reception staff.

We dined at the restaurant on our first evening and the food was excellent.  

I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone staying in Dublin.  The hotel is in a good location, close to the airport and only about a 15 minute walk to Dublin centre.",5,2011,11,29
211,above and beyond service,"We traveled to Ireland in October this year and Dublin was our last stop. We were supposed to stay at the Croke Park Hotel, but due to a ""computer glitch"" they were overbooked and did not have a room for us. We were exhausted when we were told this, and I thought I was going to lose it, but before I could, the manager was called to the lobby. He brought us coffee and cookies, booked us a beautiful room at the Gresham Hotel, hired a taxi to lead us to the hotel so that we wouldn't get lost, AND paid for our dinner the next evening. FANTASTIC customer service Croke Park!! We will definitely stay with you next time we visit Dublin.",5,2011,11,28
211,Very comfortable hotel within easy distance of airport,"We only had one night in Dublin and chose this hotel on the  North side of town for proximity to the airport for an early morning flight.  The front desk staff gave us great directions for a very easy 15 minute drive directly to the car rental drop off lot and also gave us snack packs to take with us (fruit, muffin, water and coffee) since we were leaving before the restaurant opened for breakfast.  The hotel was very comfortable, nice clean rooms and good beds and pillows.",5,2011,11,28
211,Great Northside Hotel,"Just back from an overnight stay in Croke Park Hotel. Gracious staff and good facilities all round. As other reviewers have remarked it is not ideal for city centre Dublin, but for anyone with business or leisure pursuits in the north of the City it could not be bettered.",5,2011,11,27
211,A bit of a walk to town but excellent,We really felt welcome staying there and the staff was very helpful.  If we return to Dublin we will certainly stay there again.  Room was huge and shuttle bus was ok but didn't run that often.  Walk into town was about 12-15 minutes.,5,2011,11,27
211,excellent service,"We stayed for 2 nights at this hotel which was extremely comfortable.The staff were friendly and helpful ,the evening meal was delicious as were the breakfasts .It is a 15 minute walk into town but the excellent service we received all round made up for this .",5,2011,11,24
211,had a wonderful time!,"we just returned from the croke hotel and i can say that it was a wonderful experience.
we arrived at the airport and then took the 16a bus which left us around 5 minutes away from the hotel. if you decide to take a taxi then be prepared to pay 20-25 euro but the bus ticket is 2.30 euro per person. ok, the location near the hotel is not the best, it's a 15 minute walk away from the centre. the hotel itself is modern, clean and the staff friendly and helpful. we checked in without any delays and immediately upgraded us to an executive room because it was our 7th anniversary free of charge! the room was spacious with all the facilities that you could ask for, there was also an executive lounge where you could drink a cup of coffee, relax, watch the news, eat some fruit etc. as a couple with a baby we walked everywhere without taking any buses, the hop on hop off buses or any taxis and for three days our feet were in pain! in some words it's easy to go where you want to go with the help of a map and as irish are helpful, we found our way easily. if someone is insecure about things then my advice is take a taxi from the airport to the hotel and also ask about tourist information from the hotel reception. overall our experience from the hotel was really good, the tv had a lot of channels plus some cartoon channels for the baby, the breakfast was excellent and we had the chance to sleep very well and relax. ok it may had some minor issues like for example the walls needed some repair as they were cracked, or the cleaner did not replace the bath gels every day but not a problem for us. also as a reviewer said some days ago that the cleaner does not replace the towels, that's not the issue, she does but you have to leave the towels in the bath.
we would definitely go back to this hotel if we had the chance to visit ireland again.",5,2011,11,23
211,Return visit just as good,Once again we returned to the Croke park hotel for 2 nights and as we were meeting with Family from overseas we recommended that they join us to stay also friday night. the free carparking is excellent and the attention that my children got was touching. Hot chocolates and omelettes made to childrens orders were produced on both mornings of breakfast and when reception realised my brother and wife had a baby with them  a warm lavender hot water bottle with bathrobes were in their room as an extra treat...nice touch.....The staff make this hotel and Im really looking forward to a good experience in the Croke Park hotel 3 times in a row when we get the chance to return to Dublin again.We used the supervalue getaway breaks but Im sure families will snap these great offers up asap.,5,2011,11,23
211,High quality hotel,"We were greeted at the front desk with hot washcloths to refresh ourselves as soon as we arrived.  We appreciated this very much and thought it was very classy!  There is a car-park under the hotel, so parking was very convenient.  The elevators required use of our room card in order to operate, which added to our feeling of security.  The lobby, the restrooms off the lobby, the hallways – all were very clean and neat.  Our room was on the second floor and was clean and comfortable.  We walked to O’Connell Street to do some shopping, which was about 15 minutes away.  Later in the evening, after the shops were closed and we found a problem with one of our purchases, the concierge was very helpful and did what he could to fix the problem.  We had the breakfast buffet at the hotel; there were so many choices and all of it looked good!  The staff was very attentive and we enjoyed the quality of the breakfast items we chose.  We were sorry we could only spend one night at Croke Park Hotel, as it was a highlight of our stay in Ireland.",5,2011,11,22
211,excellent hotel,"we had a lovely stay at the Croke Park Hotel thanks to the wonderfu Supervalu breaks  - free carparking was very useful, very pleasant and friendly staff throughout the hotel, a lovely room with 2 doubles and a single which was perfect for myself, my husband and 2 kids aged 7 and 4. fantastic breakfast buffet, one of the best we`ve ever had in fact! We also ate dinner one evening and it was excellent too. the Hop On/Hop Off bus picks up right outside the front door and the magnificent Croke Park stadium is across the street
all in all a very good place to stay",5,2011,11,21
211,Friendly Hotel,"We stayed here last weekend and really enjoyed it,only for one night,wish it was for longer!
The staff is what makes this hotel,so helpful and down to earth.No problem when I lost the car park ticket and gave us bottles of water on check out.The rooms are a good size with really comfy beds and all you need to relax.We had to queue for a bit on Sunday morning but there was a crowd and breakfast was excellent,proper bacon and sausage,no cheap stuff you would never buy that many ""good"" hotels serve.All round great place to stay in Dublin with parking included,hard to beat.",5,2011,11,21
211,'so glad to find it!,"We had trouble finding it, but once we did--it was very nice.  We were greeted with hot towels and we able to check in early.  We were given water bottles when we left.

They gave us good directions to get to the airport--no far at all!

We were able to walk to Towne Centre within about 20 minutes.

We had the best breakfast of all the hotels we stayed at in Ireland!

Great little Italian restaurant just down the street.",5,2011,11,19
211,Excellent Hotel,"Croke Park Hotel proved to us it was a 4 Star Hotel.  A wonderful experience, we enjoyed our four nights stay in Dublin.  The hotel was a perfect place to relax after so many days of travel.  The room was great, the beds were comfortable and the service could not have been improved on.  The breakfast was a nice way to start the day.  I would definitely stay in this hotel if I were lucky enough to return to Ireland.",5,2011,11,18
211,Very comfortable and beautiful food!,"Stayed here for 1 night using a Boards Deal voucher. Room was beautiful, very modern clean with a huge bathroom. Only thing was that the room was very warm! There was air conditioning but it was loud having it on through the night. Breakfast was the best in any hotel I've ever stayed in. The best selection for breakfast anywhere. The evening meal we had was beautiful as well! Would recommend this hotel and would go back myself!",4,2011,11,18
211,Outstanding,"We stayed here for 2 nights before we left Ireland.  All of the staff were freindly and helpful.  Our room was comfortable, well maintained and very clean",5,2011,11,18
211,Very modern hotel which lived up to its 4 Star Rating,"Stayed in this hotel for one night with my wife in early November which had a package deal incl B&B, dinner, champagne, chocolates, breakfast in bed etc. Everything which was supposed to be in the package was provided, no reminding needed. The room was very comfortable with all modern fittings incl flat screen TV. Bed was extremely comfortable. Dinner was very good despite the fact that there was a function going on.
Parking is also provided free of charge (a bonus in Dublin city) and you don't have to worry about getting a space (they have plenty).
Only minus is the bar area which lacks character - you feel like you are in a big hall.
Would definitely go back.",4,2011,11,17
211,Absolutely fantastic,"Just spent a wk end in this hotel with 7 friends. The rooms are fantastic with extremelly comfy beds and brilliant facilities...food was amazing and staff went beyond the call of duty...thanks to you all...from the callender girls, Glasgow",5,2011,11,17
211,BRILLIANT,"stayed here with my boyfriend for my 21st birthday! went for a relaxing weekend away to enjoy the city of Dublin as we havent been since we were kids. The hotel was fantasic! Staff were very friendly, lovely atmosphere and the hotel room was in immaculate condition. We had breakfast both mornings and had on evening meal in hotel, never tased food like it, was just amazing :) i will most certainly be back staying in Croke Park Hotel.",5,2011,11,17
211,"Great hotel, freindly staff, excellant service","Stayed friday and saturday night with a meal in the bistro on the friday. Food was very nice, no complaints whatsoever.",5,2011,11,16
211,Service second to none,"We spent a very enjoyable weekend here . I'd say its a model of how to run a hotel with its attention to detail , very friendly and accomodating staff , lovely up-to-date room , spotlessly clean , and excellent food both evening and breakfast . We were unlucky enough to get a room with a slightly claustrophobic view of the inner courtyard and I suppose the location could be better , though its an easy twenty-minute walk to the city centre . But in the face of such excellence these factors were relatively unimportant .",5,2011,11,15
211,Now thats what I call a 4* hotel...at last!!!,"Stayed here for 2 nights as my husband was running the Dublin marathon Oct 2011.  Underground secure parking, greeted by friendly staff at reception.  Room was spacious, modern, immaculate condition (new hotel so should be), mini bar & great room service!!!  Latest dvd releases in room entertainment with packages for popcorn, ice cream etc. Never saw this in a hotel before & it was reasonably priced!!!  Had lunch in hotel on the 1st afternoon & ate dinner on the 2nd evening, really good food, highly recommended.  Good variety for breakfast & again really friendly staff.  Nothing was a hassle.  Really nice atmosphere in hotel if you don't want to go into the city for the night out, good location & could not fault the hotel at all!!! Complimentary water on checking out, the little extra's that add to the great experience!!!",5,2011,11,14
211,Fantastic hotel,Excellent staff service was first class and food was what u would expect in Ireland...amazing!!!,5,2011,11,14
211,Near Excellence at Fair Price Convenient to Airport and City Center,"Near Excellence at Fair Price Convenient to Airport and City Center
Check in/out: 
Checking in is literally pleasantly refreshing.  First they give you a heated moist washcloth to clean the road from your face and hands.  Those that have refused this amenity have regretted it later.  To freshen up at the end of the trip before dealing with the hotel is a really nice touch.  Four persons where eagerly waiting to serve us at the front counters when we came through the doors.  Within just a few minutes we were freshened up and checked in.  No additional credit card info taken. We received easy parking directions with information on how to navigate the secure elevator system.
The check out process was even faster.  
Staff:
All staff everywhere was very attentive with the only exception of the concierge who was missing when we needed information.  He could not be found so we struck out on our own.  This is the only reason that we are not giving this hotel a full excellent.  I do see that most other reviewers really liked the concierge service, I wished we could have experienced it also.   
Housekeeping: 
The outside appearance for the entire hotel area is very clean and nice layout.  The interior had no lack of care that I could find, and I did look.  Even the public toilet area in the lobby showed continuous meticulous care.  The many seating and waiting areas are all very welcoming.  The house restaurant and pub even though they are very busy are also held to the high standard I came to expect.  All guests where very happy while we stayed.  The pub at night was a very happy place with many guests and by morning breakfast you could not tell a soul had been there because it was so clean.  The breakfast buffet was continually maintained in a presentable way with almost anything hot or cold you may desire for breakfast from many countries.  
Room:
Our room was equipped with many comfort features that all were found to be well kept and clean.  The spaciousness of our king size room accommodations allowed for a flat screen tv, cd/mp3 entertainments system, ironing area, mini-bar, additional seating, separate shower and bathtub with plenty of extra room. The view we enjoyed was of the hotel commons.  I can find no complaint or criticism of this accommodation.  My other concerns for traveling in Ireland are as follows, Water pressure perfect, Hot water/shower plenty available,  Sleep quality perfect for me on a firm bed with a pillow top. Noise level was very little from the street or the interior.  Wash clothes: yes, from the moment we arrived and some in the room.  Toilet was a two button system with enough water pressure that it worked perfectly.  Environmental controls are on the middle apartment wall with instructions to be found in the hotel information book that you may find on your desk.  Power supply was all Irish/British outlets, turned on by putting your keycard in a slot by the door.  The outlets and table lights may be controlled by a switch by the door.  (I’m not fond of the power format.) 
Parking:
Parking is complimentary and found easily under the hotel.  It is fairly secure for a parking garage.  Once you are in the elevator that gives you limited access you find yourself in a more comfortable environment.  The arrangement of this city parking scheme is better than found at most hotels in the US.
Location:
Super location directly beside Croke Stadium and nearly a direct road to and from the airport on N1/Swords Road that you will find most car rental return locations as well as favorably priced gas to fill the auto with before returning it.   It is about a 10 to 15 minute walk to the beginning of the busy city center streets.
Internet:
There is Wi-Fi only in the public areas on the first floors.  Broadband was available and the Ethernet cable was already in the room. Plenty of bandwidth to do whatever you want with.  If you are planning to watch your favorite us shows from here, you may need a better plan, most are blocked from streaming to this area, sadly so was BBC online.
Safety: 
Always be aware of your surroundings and never act like a tourist.  Even though this is a city location at no time did I feel that I was not safe on the grounds.  
Helpful hints: 
Best pricing I can find for this location is part of an independent travel package.  Otherwise they have deals from time to time on their website our use vouchers from various retailers Ireland wide.  For deals at locations in the surrounding area and throughout Ireland there is pamphlet display near check-in that includes vouchers and deal information.  The restaurant and pub in the hotel are nice and there is not a reason to go elsewhere.  However if you like to adventure out and eat like the locals, directly south is a take away at the end of the street.  
Additional Information:
In my opinion if you are walking from the hotel to city center areas I would suggest walking south on Russell St to North Circular Rd.  Then travelling west to Lower Dorset St where you would again turn south.  Travel this street to Upper Dorset St and continue on of take Frederick or Pamell south.  Easy travelling, if you like walking.",5,2011,11,13
211,Amazing hotel!,"Me and my other half stayed at the Croke Park Hotel for 2 nights on a 3 day visit to Dublin from England.
This hotel is very modern we stayed on the Executive Floor of the hotel that is located on the 4th floor (top) we were in a room facing a railway track that was very quiet and a river. We got the bus from the Airport to the hotel a 30 minuet travel time on the 16a or 41 bus at a cost of €1.85 there is a 5 minuet if that walk from the bus stop to the hotel. We asked the bus driver to tell us when to get off so we didn't miss it.

Upon arrival at the hotel we were welcomes with a very nice lobby and were given hot towels to refresh at checkin. You need your key card for the lifts this also stopped people without access to the executive floor from accessing it as they don't have the relevant key card!

The rooms were very big and the bathroom was the usual you would expect. With both bath and a large shower. The room was very clean and was cleaned every day. Turndown server was a good added bonus too.

Once we had checked in and explored the hotel (and the executive lounge where there is a free breakfast with some rooms and food and drink served all day free of charge so Id say go to the exec floor!) anyway we wanted to head into town for a look around. As this was our first time to Dublin we asked the hotel concierge I don't remember his name but he was amazing! Gave us a map and showed us how to get there (was about a 10-15 minuet walk but maybe a tad too far for the older generation!)

On our second day we took the tour bus (Green Tour bus) you can buy tickets as a reduced price from the concierge in the hotel, and the bus will pick your up from the hotel front at set times.

This is by far one of the best ways to see the city you can get on and off the bus as much as you like for 2 days solid! Visiting every attraction you can imagine! We went found for 2 days and went round the rout about 6 times! You even get live commentary!

Sadly our last day came and we didn't fly till 6.00pm so I asked reception if we could stay in our room for a bit longer. We got to keep the room till 1.30pm free of charge.
Upon checkout we were issued with a free bottle of water and off we went!

Overall this hotel is very modern, good location for the young but maybe not for the older of us (70+) very clean, staff are all amazing if you need anything they will help.

I refure anyone to this hotel and go back myself anytime.",5,2011,11,13
211,"Good hotel, bad location","We spent two nights at the Croke Park Hotel in Dublin, for a girls weekend away.  The location is not the best... It is near enough to walk into the main city centre, but was quite a long walk.  We did tend to walk into the centre, but get a cab back when our feet were too tired to do the long walk.  Also at night we got cabs both ways.  (On one of the nights we asked reception to call a cab for us, and for some reason or other, when the cab driver arrived and went over to reception, the couple who requested their cab 10 minutes after us, were called over to take the cab.  We asked why they had given the cab to the other couple, to which we were told that they had forgotten we were waiting for a cab too. We then had to wait another half an hour for the second cab to arrive. No apology was made, and no offer of a drink for while we waited)
  Upon arrival we checked in with no problem, and were shown to our room.  We had specified that we wanted a triple room with three single beds, but we were given a room with a single bed, and a double bed.  We called reception, and were told we could change rooms to one with three separate beds, which we did. There were two bottles of Rose Prosecco on ice in our room on arrival, which we assumed was part of the package we had booked. We thought we ought to check with reception, and were told that, yes, it was included. So, there was lots for us to move to the new room on another floor.  Eventually we were in our room, with our luggage, coats, Prosecco, glasses etc, but it was quite inconvenient and we could have done without the hour or so spent dealing with it, and moving our stuff, to start our weekend.  The next day, the husband of one of the girls I was with, rang to ask if we had received the Prosecco he had ordered for us as a surprise.  We were left feeling awful that we hadn't called to thank him, but we hadn't been told that that is where it had come from.  We spoke to someone on reception to ask why they hadn't told us when we rang to enquire about it? No one gave us an answer, no one apologised, and no one seemed to really care. This was disappointing.
  We had dinner in the hotel on the first night. There was nothing on the set menu that we fancied, but we were told (only when we asked) that we could have an allowance towards the a la carte menu. However, the waitress wasn't sure how much, and we had to wait quite a while for her to check with someone else.  Dinner was fine, pretty much what we expected.
  Breakfast was much better, really delicious, and a great choice, really good service too. I ordered a bowl of porridge, which was delicious, and HUGE!
  The room was comfortable, nice and quiet, and very clean.
  I can't help but think that if we would have ordered a straightforward twin or double room, and if our friend had not ordered our surprise Prosecco, and if we had just ordered from the normal set menu, then my review would have been very different.... However, each guest is different, and each guest should be able to expect that their needs/requirements be met in an efficient and courteous manner, even if they stray slightly off the normal course.
  The majority of guests that use this hotel are visiting Dublin for an event in Croke Park Stadium, which is over the road from the hotel, or people going there on business.  I can see why they would use this hotel for convenience.  If you wanted somewhere clean and comfortable to get your head down, then this would be for you. I think for anything more, you might want to look at somewhere else.
  I will add that I would have given three and a half stars if I could, rather than just three... But three means ""poor"" and four means ""very good"", but I would rate it in between... ""satisfactory"".",3,2011,11,12
211,Well worth it - excellent hotel.,"Stayed for 3 nights November 2011 with friends. On arrival it was really nice to freshen up with a hot cloth from the reception whilst checking in. 
Stayed in executive rooms - complimentary continental breakfast, slippers, bath robe, chocolates, turn down service, wi - fi, etc - all the additional perks associated with the fourth floor. 
Staff were excellent - especially Anna in the bar area - all very friendly and helpful. 
Bought our bus tour tickets from the concierge and saved 2 euros per person (student rates). 
Enjoyed our complimentary drink each in the bar each night - also enjoyed food in there on the first evening - excellent fish - would totally recommend. Bar prices in the hotel were not any more expensive than in the town - so we enjoyed a couple of drinks at the end of each night back at the hotel. Use of the executive lounge in the evening was a plus too - with complimentary tea/coffee/water and fruit available if needed. 
The main bar is totally cosy, relaxing and modern with a good vibe in the evening. 
The rooms were large and cosy with all the expected facilities for a 4 star hotel. Bathroom a good size too and very clean. 
Having been to Dublin several times and stayed in a variety of locations - my husband and I both agree that this is certainly the best hotel we've ever stayed in whilst in Dublin.
It is about a 15 minute walk to town from the hotel (10 - 13 euros in a taxi depending on where you're going), but it is well worth it and actually nice to stretch the legs - we certainly do not see this as a negative - in fact for us it is preferable to staying in town where it can be really noisy at times. 
The canal runs next door to the hotel and is good for an easy flat walk after breakfast (just watch the dog poo!!!).
Additionally, if not eating in the hotel, try the Italian restaurant about 50 yards up the road - excellent, very tasty food, and also very reasonable for Dublin.
All in all - would not hesitate to recommend this hotel - we certainly could not fault anything with our visit.
We'll be back! Thank you Croke Parke!",5,2011,11,09
211,lovely hotel but out of center of town,"The hotel was spotless, the food was very good, service was so very friendly but it is not close to downtown.  The room was very modern and had an amazing bathroom with both a tub and a large shower.  there was a double bed and a single bed in the room.",4,2011,11,08
211,Decent 4 Star But Long Walk,All Round Good Service But nothing specail. very friendly staff. Not the best hotel for a quick weekend away as a bit too far outside the centre.,3,2011,11,08
211,Relaxing Break,"Ordinary modern hotel from the outside but lovely inside with the best welcome we've had from any hotel. The young Irish man on Reception greeted us by name throughout our stay & the Concierge service was the best we've had, with great advice, discounted tour tickets both for the open topped tour bus & advice on how to use our hotel keycard to get a discount for the Croke Park Stadium tour -well worth doing.The hotel diningroom was the best organised of any hotel we've been to all over the world, with friendly attentive service & no wait for a table at busy breakfast time.On our second night we were unable to get a booking for dinner (we had enjoyed our included dinner the night before) but the bar meal was really good & the bar/lounge was cosy, although large, with great service & a good buzz. We've stayed in three good hotels in Dublin - no complaints- but The Croke Park couldn't be beaten for comfort, service & real Irish hospitality. We look forward to returning as soon as possible.Don't be put off by the location. It was easily walkable to the centre in the daytime & a cheap taxi ride back at night.",5,2011,11,05
211,First time and will be back,"First time staying in the Croke Park Hotel and certainly will not be the last. From our welcome to our departure the hotel staff and amenities made this a really enjoyable experience. Spotlessly clean, friendly, courteous and helpful staff and great food and excellent rooms. Bit of a walk to the city centre (about 15 minutes) but with taxis being no problem to get either to or from the hotel it is within easy reach of the shopping and entertainment areas. Had a deluxe room and the use of the executive lounge was a real bonus.
Thanks to everyone at the hotel, you done the Doyle Collection proud",5,2011,11,04
211,Excellent 5 Star Stay,"We arrived at the Croke Park Hotel on a Saturday to attend a party in the area. We were welcomed by the very friendly reception staff who advised us of all the services available in the hotel, they also allowed us a late check out (1pm) at no extra charge which was a nice touch.

On entering the room I was very impressed. It was a good size with a work space area, plenty of storage for clothes and luggage and a mini fridge, ice bucket and glasses. Also there was a flat screen tv, cd player and a keyboard for internet use. The room aslo included an iron with board and a trouser press, the air con could also be adjusted to suit. The bathroom was great, almost a big as the bedroom, it had a shower bath which was very good. Every surface was spotless.

We had something to eat in the Sideline bar and it was very good, the staff were friendly and efficient. On the way back to the room we took avantage of the free internet at the business centre. 

I would recommend this hotel to anyone and hope to return some time soon.",5,2011,10,31
211,Perfect!,We stayed here for our honeymoon. The room was always very clean and the entire staff was so helpful. It is a bit out of the way but a nice 15 minute walk to town.,5,2011,10,31
211,Great Room- Great Service,"We stayed here on the last night of our trip in March 2011. I'm sure I submitted a review previously but perhaps it didn't ""take"". Anyway, this hotel was excellent on all counts; the service in getting arrangements made was great as was the service while we were there- including getting a cab for us. The room was just great- large, clean, and a nice-sized bathroom. We had breakfast there the next morning-- very good. This room was part of a package so I can't speak to the value in terms of the price but my wife and I and the friends we traveled with all enjoyed it very much and would stay there again.",5,2011,10,30
211,Fantastic hotel 5 star customer service,"We had a fantastic stay at The Croke park hotel, The room was excellent, food excellent. we booked the zoo package & it was fantastic value for money with free parking at the hotel was an added bonus. Our daughter had a high temperature and the hotel staff could not do enough for us I have never experience this level of customer services and I would highly recommend anyone to stay at this hotel.",5,2011,10,30
211,One day in Dublin,"We had a one-night stay at the start of a week in Ireland. Croke Park was the perfect place to begin an Ireland holiday. The front desk staff was very accommodating (allowing an early check-in) and directing us to Steve, the concierge, to get our Dublin day started.  He was absolutely the best - friendly, knowledgeable and professional. At the end of the day we returned to the hotel and had a light meal in the bar. Our waitress was great and, in fact, the entire staff at Croke Park is to be complimented on their attention to the guest.  Our room was just what we needed after a long day of travel, touring and Guinness..... The next we we departed and Steve helped get this started. Our rental car battery was dead. He had a charger in his arsenal and got life back into the beast. Again, the staff was great with Steve as the shining star.........",5,2011,10,30
211,Fabulous Hotel,"Just got back from a 4 night stay at Croke Park Hotel with my husband for our 1st wedding anniversary.

The hotel is really lovely. Extremely clean, excellent bedroom with very spacious bathroom. Very quiet (nothing on at the stadium though), with super friendly, diligent staff.

I emailed ahead to ask if anything special was provided for a special occasion & we were upgraded to the executive floor, which meant king sized bed, robes, lavender hot water bottle nightly, & free continental breakfast daily (we had a room only reservation) available in the executive lounge where there was access to papers, sky tv, unlimited supply of water/juice/teas/coffee etc. We also had an ice bucket with two mini bottles of fizz on arrival, too. A lovely touch. They have a well equipped gym (no pool sadly) & free wifi, as well as 2 computers, printer & photocopier in lobby.  Our flight wasn't until the evening, so after we checked out at 11am, we left our bags at hotel for the day and picked them up before heading to airport. 

I've rated the hotel 3/5 for location, as it is a little walk into town. Fine for us but with children/old folk, it might be a little too far, & as the best way to see Dublin is by foot, we ended up walking at least 10k a day. We certainly earnt our pints of Guinness! However, if you require a hotel near Croke Park stadium, you couldn't any closer if you tried.

The best way to get to the hotel from the airport is definitely by bus (16a or 41 to Drumcondra Station). Don't spend €20-25 on a taxi when the bus is only €1.75!

I would definitely stay here again, a great experience where the staff go above and beyond.",5,2011,10,29
211,"Excellent hotel, although we weren't keen on the location.","This is a fabulous hotel and we thoroughly enjoyed our stay here.  The staff were all really friendly and helpful and totally professional at all times.  The rooms are clean, spacious and of a high specification.  The beds were comfortable - although my son found that if he climbed into bed a bit too fast then the bed skidded across the floor!  The bathroom had a bath and a separate shower, with quality toiletries provided.  In the wardrobe were two bathrobes and two pairs of slippers.  We chose a deluxe room, which gave us access to the Executive Lounge, which was lovely.  The lounge was usually empty and always had a good supply of tea, coffee, water and fruit.  Continental breakfast was also served in the Executive Lounge which was plentiful and included fruit, cereal, a range of breads, cheeses, dried fruit and smoked salmon and meats. We were offered the option to change to the full breakfast, served in the restaurant downstairs, but chose not to.

There were some lovely touches which sets this hotel apart from others, such as free wifi, a turn-down service and lavender scented hotties in the bed and bottled water offered to guests checking out. 

The only downside of the hotel was the location.  We felt that the area was not very welcoming.  That said, the transport links into town were good and Drumcondra Road itself was ok for our needs.  If you are travelling with a family I would recommend buying a family bus ticket which was only 10.80 euros and allowed two adults and up to four children to travel all day - good value!  

I wouldn't hesitate to recommend this hotel to anyone and would definitely stay again.  Thanks for a lovely couple of nights in Dublin.",4,2011,10,29
211,Loved it,Great hotel - nothing was too much trouble for any of the magnificent staff - lots of nice touches lavendar hottie placed in bed - complimentary voucher for tea and scones - excellent loved it,5,2011,10,28
211,Hidden Gem,"Just perfect. Nothing was a problem to the staff. We were issued with complementary umbrellas during the incessant rain. Room service was great, breakfast awesome. 15 mins walk to GPO building. Lots or americans who we love, so much more considerate than your average Brit. No drunken groups coming in at stupid o'clock! See you all soon.  ",5,2011,10,27
211,Brilliant hotel in great location,"We stayed here for two nights the location was great 
The rooms were excellent and spotlessly clean.
The staff were really friendly and couldn't do enough for you.
We eat in the restaurant one of the nights and in the bar the other.
The food was superb absolutely top notch and service was quick with out been rushed.
We included breakfast when we booked and it was well worth it. 

In short it's a great hotel we'll stay here again",5,2011,10,26
211,Most Comfortable Beds EVER!,"Croke Park is a beautiful hotel, the staff are super friendly, kind and extremely helpful! We want to especially thank young Stephen in the restaurant at breakfast (he got us snacks, water and tea every morning when we were headed out on the road for a day trip) and Grishna (not sure of the spelling) at the Concierge desk was most helpful with our pre-booked day trips. He arranged for the tour bus to pick us up at the hotel at 630 AM instead of us having to make our way downtown in the dark, most appreciated!! 

The food is delicious in the restaurant! The business centre is small (2 computers) but was always available when I needed it, and the internet access was free!

The beds were seriously the MOST COMFORTABLE BEDS EVER! It was a shame there is so much to see and do in Dublin, I could have lay in that bed all day!! Ha ha!!  ;-)

The only ""negative"" about this hotel is its distance from the core downtown area, it is about 20-30 minute walk or a $8-10 Euro cab ride. It isn't too bad for most guests but I was travelling with my older Mom and it was too far for her to walk so we spent a lot of money on cabs.

I would highly reccommend this hotel to anyone who appreciates friendly welcoming staff, beautiful surroundings, quiet rooms, good food and and super comfy beds!!",4,2011,10,26
211,Good  but ?,Stayed weekend at hotel. Very well appointed. Very welcoming. On arrival we were given refreshment towels which was a nice and welcome touch. Rooms are very comfortable and clean. Staff most pleasant and willing to help/advise. Food good. Guests seem to come from many countries. The only downside was the smell of stale smoke at times permeating the corridor where our bedroom was. There is a fragrance bowl but it was not always effective. This was unfortunate as everything else about the hotel was to be recommended.,4,2011,10,26
211,Good location and friendly,"We only stayed one night in a family room for 2 children and 2 adults.  Room was clean, comfortable and quiet.  Hotel is right across the road from Croke Park Stadium and might be busy and nosiy when a game is on.  Parking is underground in secure carpark. Staff were friendly and helpful. Room service good.",4,2011,10,25
211,Croke Park Hotel,"The hotel has a lovely lobby and is right across the street from the rugby park.  We arrived in the morning and were able to get right into our room.  The rooms were nice, we were disappointed not to have US outlets, as so many other hotels had had in Ireland.  The area around the hotel felt slighty sketchy- we walked to the hop on- hop off bus but took a cab back in the evening.  Not that the hop on hop off bus will pick you up right at the hotel.  But the Croke Park is the 1st stop and you spend over an hour picking up guests at other hotels. The walk was maybe 20 minutes.  The lobby bar looked very nice, though we were too tired to try it out.  Breakfast was very good- and included!  It was also a very short drive to the airport in the morning.  The free underground parking was a nice perk too!",4,2011,10,24
211,perfect Dublin hotel,"We stayed here on our last night in Dublin. We arrived at 9 pm. exhausted and starving from a 9 hour dash from cong, up to northern Ireland to giants causeway, carrick-a-rede bridge,and down through Belfast then down to Dublin to catch our morning flight out. Staff were amazing.They quickly checked us in we were up graded to the executive floor. It has it's own lounge with orange juice,tea, coffee, ect. breakfast in the Am. The room was large,and the beds were very comfortable! They got us settled into the dining room where we had an excellent meal with great service. My son was writeing an article for culprit his on line magazine, so stayed  in the bar lounge and talked with the very freindly staff about Irish football. My only regret is that we only had one night in this hotel. This was my favorite hotel on my 8 day stay in Ireland, only surpassed by Ashford Castle. We had 2 days in Dublin on the front side of our trip/ wish our 2 days to start would have been here instead of the Regency. Check out was very quick also. Can't say enough good things about the staff.They had wirless in the rooms  a big plus.",5,2011,10,23
211,Good place to stay for dublin airport,"We stayed one night, it is convenient to the airport and not too far from town to catch a last minute sight. The hotel is right across from the stadium so you might want to check for any events prior to booking. The breakfast was fabulous nice buffet. Even free parking! The hotel was a little dirty in the halls although they had a game the night before.",3,2011,10,23
211,"Good, could be great","Booked this hotel for a ridiculously cheap price (you could be mistaken for thinking the price for three nights is actually the cost per night...) and so really the fact that this hotel had a bed and a roof should have been enough!  

The pros are the proximity to the port and the airport - it is an easy run to the hotel from either location, and we paid just over twenty euros for a cab from the airport.  Annoyingly the airport bus does not incorporate the hotel, although apparently it does stop reasonably nearby.

The communal areas are beautiful and spotless.  There is a very nice looking gym, although we didn't get around to using it. The restaurant is fantastic, and competitively priced compared to the other eateries in Dublin (that doesn't make it cheap by UK standards, but you know when you go to Dublin you aren't going for cheap eats).  Again, the restaurant and bar areas are very contemporary and welcoming in their appearance.  Both were well-used and had a nice atmosphere, though the bar was really busy and quite loud on week nights, seemingly full of business people.

The biggest positive I can say about the hotel is that it has the most comfortable bed I have ever slept in, and the turn-down service was a lovely extra.

The breakfast was nice, but not quite Hilton-standard. It was great to have hash browns, but given we were in Ireland some farls would've gone down a treat. It's a shame there were no veggie sausages or bacon either. 

 I found the service in the breakfast room/restaurant a bit hit-and-miss.  We had to wait a while to get staff's attention for tea, coffee etc, and waited an age to get our bill after our restaurant meal.

We requested an upgrade to the Executive Floor and I was a little disappointed by the presentation of the room, which I felt was rather dated.  It's a shame the classy and contemporary look of the communal areas was not continued up here - especially as these are meant to be the best rooms.  I guess it is subjective, and I would say that the bathroom is absolutely lovely - light, modern and spotlessly clean. It could do with a heated towel rail though.

The room air conditioning/heating was fantastic and very quiet and efficient. As others have said, the lounge is a lovely bonus, as is the ice machine.

The location of the hotel wasn't as far from Dublin as I had thought - we walked to O'Connell Street in 12 mins, and it really is quite straightforward.  Unfortunately as Dublin is quite spread out we walked a lot in the day and we just couldn't face another walk in the evening;  taxis are quite expensive (in my view being a stingy Devonian) so we ended up just staying in the hotel as there's not much else around.  It's lucky the hotel was so nice, and the food so good.

I would warn anyone going to Dublin on a budget that it is a pricey city, even simple things like having a pint in a pub or a cup of coffee really added up.  I'm glad we only went for a long weekend because the place just eats money!  Having said that, the cost of the hotel and the flights were so reasonable that this is balanced out and we will be back.  I also thought things like the hop-on-hop-off bus tour were good value (Stephen, the concierge, deserves a special mention as he was so helpful in explaining how this worked and what would be best value for us).

It's just a few little niggly things which for me stopped this hotel from reaching its full potential; their stinginess when it came to replacing the bathroom toiletries, the way the staff were pleasant rather than friendly or chatty, the lack of heated towel rail or underfloor heating (one or the other would be nice in an executive bathroom), the dated decor in the rooms etc.  It is still a very nice hotel and if you want a good night's sleep for a bargain price you'd be hard pressed to find somewhere better in Dublin, but by just changing a couple of things it could be wonderful.",4,2011,10,23
211,Excellent value for money,"Could not believe the price we paid for our 3 day trip to Dublin (airpark, flights and 3 nights in hotel B&B).  It was unbelievably cheap, but after reading other reviews of the hotel on this site I felt totally reassured and was not disappointed.  Excellent value for money, great staff, good food which was averagely priced.  Our room was fine although not as big as some of the reviews described (I think they must have been executive rooms), however it was perfectly adequate, clean and modern and the bathroom was nice and new and roomy.  Very clean although only one small thing, I left 2 towels and a bath mat in the bath after the first day to be exchanged for clean as indicated on the notice in the room.  We returned at night to find the same towels (still damp) had been taken from the bath and re-instated on the rail (it wasn't even a heated rail and both towels had been used twice).  I know we all have to do our bit for the environment but these towels were wet and dirty so this is why I put them in the bath.  We made do without a fuss and apart from this I have absolutely no complaints whatsoever and would definitely stay here again.",5,2011,10,22
211,Very nice hotel,"Stayed here on our last night and were pleased with this hotel.  Rooms were clean and nice, and loved that there was an ice machine on the floor!  It was easy to find, and had free parking.  Breakfast was included with our stay and it was also good.  All of the staff we encountered were friendly and helpful.  We checked in late (9pm) and left early the next morning (8am) so didn't have much time to form that big of an impression, but from what I did see I would stay here again.",4,2011,10,21
211,Consistently Excellent,"I have written before about this hotel, but having stayed here for 5 days in July 2011 and one night in October 2011, I feel that I should update what I said. Back in July, when I happened to mention that I was staying for the week, I inquired about a possible upgrade to the executive floor. Like everything else in this hotel, it was no problem! It’s the simple things that make the difference, for example last time I stayed here I left behind my laptop mouse, I just inquired might it have been found, and within two clicks of the computer the receptionist was able to tell me that they had it – it was delivered to my room before I unpacked my case, now that is excellent service! The executive floor gives complementary access to the executive lounge with couches, large screen sky sports (!), unlimited tea, coffee, orange juice and water, complementary newspapers, etc.  Hey it was just like having my own private penthouse in the hotel as it was mostly empty! You can even have a quick continental breakfast there if you are in a rush in the morning. Breakfast is still excellent. Staff always coming up asking if you want fresh coffee, etc.  Their porridge is still not up to my standard, but that is such a subjective item to get right that I won’t be too critical in that regard. My October trip was just a quick one night stay, I was in a regular room this time but other than access to the executive lounge, you would not notice any difference in the rooms. This is still my number one place to stay whenever I go to Dublin.",5,2011,10,19
211,Great stay on the night of the All Ireland Final!,"We arrived very early in the morning on a red eye flight, and the front desk was very accommodating in getting us into our room early in the morning.  The room was comfortable and clean, and the staff was very helpful (even with the All Ireland Hurling Final that afternoon!).  The hotel is literally directly across the street from the stadium, and it was an easy bus ride from the center of Dublin (though it is also walkable).  The breakfast buffet was very tasty and had a wide variety of options, and the concierge was helpful giving us directions even with a packed front lobby the morning after the match.",5,2011,10,19
211,Fantastic Hotel!,"What a great hotel! I booked for a relaxing night in Dublin and this hotel did not disappoint in any way, check in was a breeze as was the check out. Staff can only be commended for their genuine friendly and helpful attitude and it was hospitality at its best. My room was really nice and spotlessly clean there where great facilities and room service available. We needed the assistance of the concierge he was fantastic. Liverpool v Man United on the big screen in the bar with a couple of pints of Bulmers and a really lovely sandwich who could ask for more? This hotel deserves its high rating on Tripadvisor and in my opinion if they keep going the way they are they will reach number 1. Thank you and I hope your management reward you for such a great review the staff are what make the hotel!",5,2011,10,18
211,Super Hotel,"Hotel is across the street from the Croke Park Stadium.  The hotel is super.  Our room was very, very nice.  One needed to use hotel room key to access the bedroom floors (both the stairs from the lobby and the lifts from the lobby).  They had computer access free of charge.  At designated times, the green Hop On- Hop Off bus provides a shuttle from the hotel to stop # 1 which is  the beginning of the tour.  Before boarding the shuttle, one must have a valid ticket for the green Hop On- Hop Off  tour.  It is an eight or nine block walk from the hotel to Parnell Square and about a 4 or six block walk to O’Connell Street from Parnell Square..  We walked back and forth to town from the hotel.  Stop #23 for the green Hop On-Hop Off bus is for the Writers Museum which is on Parnell Square so if one  takes that tour and one’s  ticket is valid ,  one can take get off at stop # 23 and reduce your walk to the hotel to 8 blocks.  There are a few businesses near the hotel: Enterprise Rent a Car and an auto tire place an Asti  which is an Italian restaurant.  For the most part the walk between Parnell Square and the hotel is residential with a few small B and B’s/hotels.  At least two streets have traffic lights but no pedestrian lights.  I would stay at this hotel again if I could afford it, and if the quality does not fail.",5,2011,10,16
211,Excellent hotel So-so Location,"If you have a car and are planning to catch an early flight from Dublin airport, this is the hotel for you! All facilities are first rate, the staff extremely helpful, and the rooms are clean and comfortable. Parking is free, and the ride to the airport is quick and easy. If you plan to explore downtown Dublin, I'd stay elsewhere. A cab costs about 15 euro to center city and it is much too far for an old man like me to walk. I understand that one can book tours that include transportation from the hotel, but I prefer to tour on my own. 
Don't get me wrong. I really liked the hotel. But if you don't like Gaelic football, there's not much to do in the neighborhood.",4,2011,10,14
211,"Lovely hotel, great travel experience","Lovely hotel, free parking, adjustable air conditioning/heating. Lovely food, drink a bit expensive. Excellent staff everywhere, and a detailed knowledge  of local attractions. Complimentary bottle of water on leaving....lovely touch. All in all, a fantastic experience... will be back for more, and have told lots of people about our lovely experience.",5,2011,10,13
211,Solid,"Somewhere between a good, solid chain hotel and a boutique hotel.  Very clean, very comfortable, modern, roomy, efficient.  I got a pretty good price on my room (off-peak nights, no sporting events or anything going on), so I was very pleased with my stay.  Drew a nice bath, enjoyed the slippers and robe, good breakfast.  Perfect.

As far as location, it's not in the center of the city, but walking is totally an option (15-20 mins?) and a cab ride is less than 10 Euro.  Not a lot going on in the immediate area, nor is it the most attractive area but... it was certainly nice and quiet.  Good staff, too.",5,2011,10,12
211,Outstanding on every count!!  First-class service!!!  The staff goes above ande beyond what a five-star hotel would give,"My daughter and I just spent five days at the Croke Park Hotel.  We travel extensively, but I never tqake the time to write reviews !!!   However this is an exception - everyone from the front desk to the manager to the wait staff want to make sure you are their only guests!!  The staff must love their jobs as they are all so relaxed and accommodating!!  As well, the food is unbelievable - the breakfast buffet includes everything to ones liking and is baked fresh daily.  The managers helped us out with a couple of 'hicups' and everything was taken care of to our satisfaction and beyond.  We couldn't have been happier with our choice in hotel .The conciege want makes sure you enjoy your days in Dublin.  The front desk always welcomed us back form our day away etc.The beds, linens and towels rival a Hilton.  It was spotlessly clean and the decor was lovely!!!  I could go on and on..............

There isn't anything left to say other than for you to go and visit!!  I know you won't be disappointed!!!!!!  Signed two Canadian women who love to travel!!!!",5,2011,10,11
211,Brilliant Hotel!,We stayed in a triple room for two nights. The room was spotless and very comfortable. Loved the bathroom. This was a very good hotel for a weekend break in Dublin. Lovely bar and lounge area and the manager in this area was very friendly and welcoming. Bar food very nice and reasonably priced. Will definitely stay here again.,5,2011,10,11
211,Great Hotel,this is a lovely hotel. we got a great deal. 150 euro for 2 nights B&B with one evening meal in the restaurant. The room was clean and it had everything that we needed. There is free underground parking. the staff were lovely and we would stay here again. A+,5,2011,10,09
211,Wonderful hotel,"I stayed here with my mother for three nights last week. We were so delighted with the staff, room, reception area and housekeeping. The staff are outstanding. The meals were delicious. We loved the pillowtop mattresses. My mother has a painful shoulder problem and the bed suited her not like many other good hotels we have been in. The Croke Park Hotel deserves its high rating on tripadvisor and in our opinion will get to No. l in the near future.",5,2011,10,08
211,Restaurant disappointment,"Did not stay at this hotel only ate in restaurant.  Food I ordered was not what was on the menu.  I politely said to one waitress who apologised and took back ad offered complimentary drink but I declined as mistakes can be made.  My boyfriend didn't eat his and was waiting on mine to return.  When came out again was still different that the menu - substitutes had been used i.e. cheaper ingredients which I do not eat and cold. My boyfriend went back this time as I hate complaining and we had decided we would jut pay for our drinks and try else where. A different waitress this time was having a lengthy discussion with him so I asked was everything ok.  He was told he had to pay for his meal even though it was not eaten as he was waiting on mine and it was not stone cold.  Her response ""we'll heat it and you can eat it now!!"".  I asked to speak to manager (never done before).  While waiting we were talking to a very nice bar staff who agreed with us and told us this happens all the time.  The supervisor, Rachel I think came an sorted everything for us.  Charged for the drinks and apologised, she was very nice and offered to get me something to eat before I left but I declined as didn't want more hassle lol.  Something should probably be done about the chef, but the place did look nice to me such a pity something so small gave me a bad opinion.",3,2011,10,07
211,Loved my bed!!,Stayed in CPH for 3 nights. First night we had a standard room with double bed because we checked in late and the hotel was fully booked. Room was OK. But the other 2 nights we stayed in a deluxe room thanks to the lovely receptionist... And OMG I wish I have like this at home! Slept like a baby!!!! Thank you so much!!!! ,5,2011,10,05
211,Gorgeous hotel in Dublin!,We stayed at this hotel at the end of our trip.  The bedroom was large and the beds were very comfortable. The breakfasts were very delicious!  Dining room staff were very courteous.  Good location to the downtown area.,4,2011,10,05
211,"Fantastic Food, Nice hotel, Great location, Bad Bed","We stayed here recently and I must say the bar food in this hotel was fab.  Food was cooked to perfection and very tasty.  Nice relaxing bar with large screen so you could chill out for the evening.  I had a meeting on the monrning of our stay in town and I must I got to it with great ease (admittedly it was an 11am meeting).  My only gripe about the hotel is the bed, in this day and age king size beds should be the standard for all 4* & 5* hotels, we got a queen bed and I found it impossible to sleep, my husband and I felt there was very little room in the bed (admittedly we do have a king size at home)

Overall Yes I would recommend the hotel but would have to insist to people that they book the king room.",4,2011,10,05
211,Fantastic Hotel!!,"Just back from a stay in the Croke Park Hotel Dublin.  The hotel was gorgeous, clean, great room, spacious & comfortable.  The staff were amazing, felt like a celeb the way I was treated, I had my drink carried to my table in the evening time, they fussed around myself and my husband, they could not do enough for us, from the cleaning staff,, to the staff in the restaurant - brillant!  First time at this hotel, but certainly not my last.",5,2011,10,04
211,Beautiful hotel,"We had reservations to stay here the last night of our holiday in Ireland.  When we arrived they were overbooked due to airline delays but they upgraded us to a great downtown hotel, free taxi, free parking and next morning a complimentary fabulous breakfast.  The staff couldn't have been nicer.  Convenient to the airport.",5,2011,10,03
211,Location Location.,"We recently stayed at this hotel, while attending a party across the road at Croke Park, well what can I say, Not Enough Actually, everything was fab, great food, great staff, bedrooms large and cosy, I pointed out two problems on leaving and the young lady at reception took note and assured me they would be sorted immediately, which is very refreshing because sometines when you point things out to a  hotel they get hostile and defensive. A large group of us stayed and some got dearer and cheaper rates but they adjusted the rate to suit most of the group which was a big plus. I would go back here again in a heartbeat.",5,2011,10,03
211,Wonderful part of our hotel package!,"We stayed at the Croke Park Hotel in May, 2011, as part of our Sceptre Tours vacation package.  The location was fine. Yes, it was a bit of a walk (about 20min), but if you're somewhat healthy, you'll survive. We took a cab ride back a few times, and the price was not exorbitant. The walk takes you through a working class neighborhood, so it didn't feel dangerous necessarily. The hotel was immaculate, the service was excellent, and the concierge was wonderful. The breakfast spread had good variety. Best of all, the staff -- from reception to dining and especially concierge -- was very patient and helpful. The premises are clean, the gym is better than I expected, and there are two computers available for free use. My only recommendation would have been for the hotel to offer a periodic shuttle service into/from the city center.",5,2011,10,02
211,Almost perfect ...,"We have spent three days in this lovely, clean and well managed hotel. Could not fault almost anything .... well except for lack of wifi in our room (there was a connection for a PC but no use for me, the iPhone user) and ... 55min wait for a meal during dinner (meal was very good as a matter of fact).
Before you decide not to stay there think about all the things you may give a miss. Enormous bed !!!! very good breakfasts, clean and well equipped rooms.  Brilliant facilities i.e. gym, friendly staff and overall a very pleasurable experience.
The good thing is that hotel management are interested in customer's satisfaction. After we came back home I have received a survey which I duly completed (needless to say that I've mentioned all of the above). Couple of days later I have received an email from operations director, apologising for my experience and thanking for my feedback. As a customer I could not be happier with his response and would very much chose the Croke Park hotel next time I'm in Dublin. I'd love to check whether wifi was rolled out across whole building, as advised by Operations Director - apparently systems are being updated !!!

In summary, I am not surprised the feedback is very good - this is a very good hotel, caring about customers and their experience. A place I will stay again when in Dublin.",4,2011,09,28
211,good spot for a dublin night out!,"very comfortable room overlooking canal, lovely bar downstairs and they'll go to great lengths to make your choice of cocktail ;-) no problem walking into town and free parking for guests. would stay there again.",4,2011,09,28
211,girly weekend,"just came back from a weekend away with the girls, Croke park is a lovely hotel, very clean with comfortable beds.bathroom gorgeous with a fabulous shower. Great choice for Breakfast, with tea and coffee facilities in the room. only downside was the position, a good 30 minute walk from the town centre or 10 min taxi ride, also right opposite croke park football ground , therefore the hotel was very busy on match day .",4,2011,09,26
211,Nice Modern Hotel,"We stayed here the last night of our Ireland Holiday. Very warm welcome  at the front desk with the warm towels. Clean room, very clean shower and bath. Comfortable king bed. Great night sleep. We went to breakfast late and our choices were limited but ok.",5,2011,09,25

211,"Overall very good hotel, 8 out of 10","Very inviting and modern lobby, super friendly reception staff. Room was very modern, ""warmly"" decorated and appealing. We stayed for one night in room 149 (a disabled room but the only one available for a 10:00 am check in. Clean room (9 out of 10)

The room is located at the back corner of the hotel and above the service bay, so we had a view of the vacant, desolate concrete lot at the rear, and were treated to the sounds of the service bay door being opened and closed, and the sounds of the garbage being clanged into the dumpster from within the building.

Overall, I'd recommend it, just not that room or one that faces the rear of the building.",4,2011,09,23
211,Awesome!,"Very good 4-star hotel... a little bit outside of Dublin city center. The area is kind of run-down, but I'd say it's safe day and night. Rooms very beautiful! Cozy atmosephere, very comfortable beds, modern design. Everything was perfectly clean during our stay... just the shower should have been cleaned a bit better. Breakfast good but nothing extraordinary. Typical Irish/English breakfast and thus quite greasy and unhealthy. Staff very friendly and helpful. They even gave us two little bottle of water when we checked out which I found very pleasant.",5,2011,09,23
211,tidy up,"my daughter and myself stayed in the croke park hotel on the 17th sept 2011. the room was big and clean. however the shower wasnt very strong. we had breakfast in the restaraunt which was very nice. the staff were very pleasant and polite. service was excellent. the downside was the female staff [ and im not being sexist ] looked very untidy. it looked as if there uniforms were the wrong size for them, also their hair wasnt as neat and tidy as it ought to be.... the following morning at breakfast the staff were very presentable, but looked like they were working against their will,  and some looked  like they had a hangover!!!!! breakfast was okay. after waiting 15 mins for my porridge it arrived barley warm and so thick it would plaster a wall for you!!!!!! not good value for money",3,2011,09,21
211,Looks out for Their Guest,"Myself and my friends had booked a tour a month prior to our trip to Ireland and when we checked into ""The Croke Park Hotel"" we spoke to Stephen Brannigan, Head Concierge and asked him to call and verify the pick up time and to confirm our reservation, which he did. the next morning Stephen noticed we were still sitting there, he got right on the phone and called the company to find out where they were, there was no answer. Stephen was very upset with the company and asked for our emails and stephen told us to go on our ways and he will contact then and he will no longer have them in the hotel if they do not do something for us. Stephen sent me and email within a few hours. He stayed on top of it and got us on booked on another trip on another day.",5,2011,09,20
211,"Good location,","The rooms are spacious, free parking great,bar and bistro food a bit sketchy.",3,2011,09,18
211,2nd great stay,"Hotel is accomodating to both business & family.  Newer, modern & clean.  Employees well trained and courteous & helpful.  Located across from Croke Park & convenient (4 blocks) to buses into city & airport.  Highly recommend.",4,2011,09,15
211,Very comfortable and pleasant staff,"Stayed here on the first night of our Ireland trip. Arrived tired and sleepy at 8am from a red eye flight and we were surprised that our room was available so early! That was much appreciated as we desperately need to nap before heading into the city. Also, we were offered warm moist towels at the check-in counter- nice touch.

The room was spacious and the bathroom had a tub and a shower. 

Breakfast was great with several types of granola, all sorts of breads to choose from, fresh fruit, yogurt, and also the hot buffet sausages, bacon, eggs etc. Waitress who came by to offer us toast was also very pleasant.

Finally, we had some questions for the concierge about driving to Newgrange and he advised us to take the M1 (main road) which was useful. 

Overall, a great start to the trip, especially being able to check-in much earlier than expected.",4,2011,09,14
211,Great hotel,"Spent 2 enjoyable nights at the hotel.  Hotel staff were very friendly and helpful, especially the front desk who acccommodated an early check in. Lovely relaxing restaurant where the food was great and the staff very attentive.  A modern hotel which was spotlessly clean.  Ideally located for Croke Park and a 20 minute leisurely walk to the city centre.",5,2011,09,13
211,"Great staff, but...","Just had 3 nights here and congratulations are due to the all the staff for a truly professional job, but lots of niggling little complaints need attention. On arrival we upgraded, which turned out to be poor value. The room was spotless but the electrics were faulty(a friend's room had a similar problem and lost all power at times). Switching off the main lights somehow meant the wardrobe lights suddenly illuminated, an iron in the room had a broken plug with the earth terminal clearly visible and the internet TV did not work. In the Executive Lounge the TV was broken and there were little or no refreshments available at times.
Great location if you are going to a match across the road or need to be near the port but the taxi fares to and from the city do add considerably to the costs.
Having stayed at Doyle Group hotels before, we are sure the niggles will be sorted out and we would probably stay here again but at the moment its just not up to scratch.",3,2011,09,12
211,Great Staff,"The staff at this hotel were extremely friendly and helpful especially the concierge.  The hotel is in a great location and had a hop on hop off shuttle pick up.  We were within walking distance of the main street where there was plenty of restaurants, sightseeing and shopping.  The hotel is very clean and the breakfast was excellent.  We were going to miss our breakfast on the last day because of an early flight and the hotel made us take away bags which was above and beyond what we expected.  A nice Pub in the area is The Big Tree (drinks only) and on the way back to the hotel there was a very small take away place called Gate City (I think) that is open late with good food and very cheap.",5,2011,09,12
211,Great hotel everytime,"Fab hotel. Excellent staff, food & amenities. Location is only a short hop to the city centre by bus or taxi. Great choice all round - for shows in the O2 or Grand Canal Theatre, the hotel will organise transport to & from the hotel. Very quiet rooms too.  I would recommend getting a deluxe room with complimentary access to the top floor executive lounge. This includes free newspapers, magazines, a range of teas & coffee's, fruit, biscuits etc. Oh and spectacular views of the city & surrounds.  
On one of our stays we ordered room service which was very reasonably priced and was decent food.",5,2011,09,12
211,Very nice stay,"We had a very nice two night stay for a leg of our honeymoon at the Croke Park Hotel.  Accommodations were fine, the room was nice, it was great to have decent water pressure in a shower in Ireland for once. ",4,2011,09,11
211,Excellent Hotel - amazing staff,"I have travelled a lot and have yet to come across staff as good as this hotel in Ireland. I spent 3 nights here last week and another this week. Every single staff member was crazy helpful, if that's possible! And crazy-friendly. Yet, extremely professional. The facilities are great. The gym is well-equipped and comfortable. The restaurant food, although, not out of this world, is good, including an excellent breakfast and a perfect burger. Parking is very handy and the location for access to Dublin city centre is perfect. I cannot recommend this hotel enough and I cannot commend the staff enough. I will be back.",5,2011,09,11
211,Wow wow wow!,I booked my husband and I in for our anniversary. I emailed the hotel to ask them if we could have an early check in. This was no problem. When we arrived to our lovely room we were pleasantly surprised to find a congratulations banner and balloons along with two bottles of champagne on ice. This was a fantastic gesture and a great start to our stay. The hotel is spotless. The staff are friendly and helpful. Breakfast is plentiful and dinner in the sideline bistro was gorgeous. It's in an ideal location as it is quiet and it is only a ten minute walk into town. This is the first review that I have written as I felt that this hotel definately deserves credit for what they do. I will definately return in the not to distant future. Keep up the good work!!!,5,2011,09,11
211,Fantasic ! we will go back,"We 5 ladies stayed in the Croke hotel for 3 nights,It was excellent value,  clean impressive rooms ,very , very comfortable we were sharing 3 ladies in one room {which we asked for } and we had two double beds and one single, and we all had 3 good nights sleep ! it was the birthday of one of our ladies the staff couldn""t do enough for her , a small cake at breakfast with candles and we were given bucks fizz and the staff sang happy Birthday to her,i must mention Ailean {hope thats how she spells her name } she was wonderful ,,very helpful , and friendly The only down side of staying at the Croke hotel is we had to get cabs into Dublin, cost about 11 to 12 euros but good value between 5 ladies ! we hope to return very soon .Excellent!!",5,2011,09,10
211,Excellent modern hotel,"We stayed here for 3 nights and had a great time, very clean hotel and modern with everything u need for a pleasant stay. Food inn the restaurant is lovely, the rooms are big and have a lovely bathroom, walking distance is 20mins into temple bar area or get a taxi 7 euros, I'd definitely stay here again ",5,2011,09,10
211,fab hotel,"just returned after 2 night stay in croke park hotel, was attending all ireland hurling final, staff excellent esp reception, bar food excellent, stayed in 406 and had continental breakfast in exec lounge, same fab, knew it would be good when i saw all the airline staff staying there, hope to return next year, hope tipp will be playing in all ireland!!!!!!!!!!!!!",4,2011,09,09
211,Excellent hotel with wonderful staff,"Even though this hotel is less than a mile from my home in Dublin, I ended up having to stay here during the snow last December when our holiday flights were cancelled at the last minute and we were unable to return home.
What a surprise to find the most charming staff in this lovely hotel.  Helpful is nowhere near how well they facilitated us with our various needs (one disabled person, one child, several adults).  The rooms were good and we were allowed to use the business lounge whenever we wanted in order to make alternative arrangements.  There is a great bar with a large bar-food menu, with something for everyone.  Overall the decor is stylish without being OTT.  
The location is possibly not great for those on a short city break, but it is on the airport side of Dublin (15 minutes away) and is right beside Croke Park, a huge sports and concert venue.  However it is less than five minutes by taxi to the centre (Dublin is small), or a 15 minute stroll if you do want to be outside the hustle and bustle.  There are a plethora of buses within a five minute walk as well, and several restaurants.  
I had never been into this hotel, even though it was on my doorstep, but I will have no hesitation in recommending it to any friends or relations who visit us from abroad. Overall it is a great hotel, but the staff make it outstanding.  They even gave my nephew, aged 11, a selection box of chocolates when were were leaving!",5,2011,09,09
211,will stay here again when in Dublin,"We stayed at the Croke Park for one night after arriving on the ferry before travelling to the West coast, the hotel was very easy to find, just a straight road from the dock, there was a free underground car park. All the staff were very friendly and efficient, we were offered a warm flannel on arrival and bottle of water on departure.
The room was large and very comfortable, the bathroom had a walk-in shower as well as a bath and everything was very clean.
There was free internet in the room.
Breakfast was the best selection of food we had ever seen, both hot and cold, and lots of fresh fruit.
We had dinner in the hotel and it was excellent and reasonably priced
We will stay at the Croke Park again when we are in Dublin.",5,2011,09,08
211,Great hotel! Good location!,Very clean and nice rooms! Great service. The location is a bit of a walk from the Dublin city center (about 20 minutes) but is directly across the street from Croke Park Stadium. Would stay here again!,5,2011,09,07
211,Wonderfull Hotel,"Great hotel with all the amenities. Very nicely appointed room. Across the street from Croke Park Stadium, but even during the game the room was very quiet. Ten minute walk to the center of town. Very much enjoyed our stay here.",4,2011,09,03
211,amazing Manager,"We came to Dublin on 23rd August, our Wedding anniversary and had a room booked at the hotel. Initially I thought the Hotel was a little closer to town and was slightly disappointed. I wanted a romantic get away in the centre of town and it was a present to my husband. Asking for advice, the manager showed exceptional people skills. He helped us find a room with his sister hotels in town and offered us complementary tea and coffee.

I have never encountered a better welcome, more understanding staff and such amazing management like at Croke Park. This is my thanks to them, and advise to everyone to always ask when not happy with something and not be shy- particularly in Dublin ;-)

 Julia& Mark",5,2011,09,02
211,Fabulous hotel - can't wait to go back.,"A beautiful hotel and one of the best we have ever stayed in, it is spotlessly clean, very comfortable and modern and within a short distance to the city centre. Breakfast & evening meal were excellent, staff friendly and secure free parking - what more could you ask for - if you're thinking of going - GO!!  We will definitely go back & have already recommended to family & friends.",5,2011,09,02
211,Walking distance to great food and fun,"Croke Park is tucked on a little side street DIRECTLY across from the Stadium in Dublin.  If you are traveling around the time of a match, make sure you make your reservation FAR AHEAD OF TIME.  We found our room to be very clean and quite.  The accomidations and folks at the hotel are superior.",5,2011,08,31
211,Nothing was too much trouble,"This was, for its price, the best hotel we have ever stayed in. On arrival (about a 20-euro taxi ride from the airport) we were offered an upgrade to the executive level, the cost of which covered a full Irish breakfast each morning and the use of the executive lounge. Not being executives, we felt very honoured! It was worth paying for. The executive lounge served a buffet breakfast in the morning, which we used once, and provided newspapers, magazines, and a nice space to work if we wanted to. (We didn't). Our room was lovely, with a complicated TV which accessed the internet (we think), an iron, an ironing board and an ironing machine, a kettle, and an infinite number of lamps and switches. The bathroom had a bath and a separate shower. Everything was spotless and comfortable. The housekeeper dropped my wife's makeup on the floor: it cracked, and the hotel wrote to us offering a new one! The concierge helped us to buy tour tickets, called taxis, explained the buses (it's about 10 minutes to O'Connell Street by bus, after a short walk), showed us where everything was and let us use his computer to print out our boarding cards for the trip back. Reception was also most helpful. All in all, a fantastic introduction to a very friendly city. The Italian restaurant up the road is a good alternative to the excellent hotel food.",5,2011,08,31
211,"Very nice hotel, lovely food and good service","Stayed with my wife and 8 yr old daughter for 2 nights recently and really enjoyed the hotel. Check in was quick and friendly with the added bonus of free dinner for 2 that I didn't realise was part of the package. Rooms clean, beds very comfortable, free wireless signal as well. The evening meal was excellent as was breakfast both mornings with polite staff in attendance. The bar is nice and open with lots of comfy seating and decent beer (bar staff a little blunt my only minor complaint) Free secure car parking and bottles of water on checkout rounded off a very pleasant stay!",5,2011,08,30
211,Excellent,Excellent hotel and base in Dublin; good service; bar food is lovel good internet access and nice surrounds.  Highly recommended.,5,2011,08,30
211,"Great food,location and staff","We stayed on a 2 night b&b 1 evening meal, zoo package. 
Booking in was quick and easy, there were plenty of leaflets on what to do in Dublin, and the staff were more than helpfull, booking us a taxi, answering our queries etc.  There were 2 adults, 2 children aged 10 and 12 and a baby aged 11 months. All the baby food and milk was free which was a wonderful surprise. The rooms were clean and spacious, and the breakfast and evening meal could not be faulted.  The bar had a really cosy friendly feel so we spent both nights there.  
Overall a very enjoyable stay",5,2011,08,26
211,Great hotel with great service,"We stayed at this hotel for a short 3 day stay-cation..Check in was smooth and fast and our room was perfect. The bar area was a good size and although we didn't eat the prices were surprisingly reasonable considering Dublin prices. We had a small problem with noise in the night as we were above the carpark shutter door, we mentioned this to the staff  the following day and we were moved straight away without question..The one suggestion I would make is some sort of shuttle bus into the city. Our 2 small children found it difficult to walk in/out and taxi prices varied largely.",5,2011,08,23
211,Solid hotel in Dublin,"We stayed here at the beginning and the end of a large family trip to Ireland at the beginning of August 2011. I was pleased with the hotel. It is updated and modern. We had 5 rooms; all which had updated bathrooms, comfortable beds and great bed linens. The lobby and public areas are all clean and comforable. There is a great bar area with big screen TV's and large lobby. The staff was great; the concierge was very helpful. It is located just steps from the Croke Park Stadium, so there is no better place to stay if you are in town for one of the sporting events at the stadium. The GAA finals were there our last day in town, and the hotel is absolutely jumping! They host a large party in the bar which was very lively and fun. The outdoor spaces were great- it happened to be a beautiful day. 
I don't recommend the restaurant. Breakfast was pretty good- it was included in our room price. Continental offerings and a few hot dishes as well. We did eat lunch there twice, and the food is pricey and not fantastic. 
My only concern was the location. If you are looking for a hotel that is in the middle of all the action, this is not the place. (Unless you are there on a game day!) You can walk to the areas you want to, but some will be up to a 30 minute walk. There aren't a lot of restaurant offerings close by; it is a pretty residential area. So you should figure in the costs of taking cabs when comparing this hotel price to others. All in all, I was very happy with the hotel and our stay there.",4,2011,08,20
211,"Wonderful hotel, will recommend to others!","We stayed here earlier this year and really enjoyed our stay.  Our room was more like a suite, very spacious and enough room for three of us sharing.  Tea and coffee facility in the room was really useful.  Bathroom was lovely and spacious - bath and shower!  The decor was new and clean, as if no one had stayed here before!  Only down side is the location - it is a little out from the city centre but we figured out the bus routes during our three day stay and bought a tourist three day pass which allowed us on the tourist buses as well as the local ones.  Overall, excellent, glad we chose it!",4,2011,08,16
211,Superb Service!,"Stayed at the Croke Park Hotel on Aug.02 and Aug.09, the first and last days of our Ireland vacation booked through Sceptre Tours. The staff could not have been more accomodating.  We checked in before 7am after an overnight flight from JFK and were greeted at the desk with warm towels to freshen up. WOW!  We were checked in right away, parked the car (free)  in the underground garage and then up to our rooms. The rooms were spacious and very clean with  tub and seperate shower.  The hotel is close enough to walk to the city center. Dublin is a great walking city!  The full buffet breakfast was great, as was the lunch we had on our last day. We especially enjoyed sitting  in front of the fire in the lounge area having a cocktail at the end of a long day of sightseeing.  All the staff were very gracious and accomodating, which was very much appreiated. Thank you Croke Park Hotel, we will certainly return!!",5,2011,08,14
211,Just the place to do business,"Staff helpful
Rooms very good and clean
Food top class
Good parking
10 minute walk to the city night life
In all worth a visit",5,2011,08,12
211,"Top hotel, fantastic food and best of all the staff","Stayed for two nights in July to take kids to the zoo and watch Derry play Kildare in Croke Park. Even though Derry got beat a had a brilliant weekend, thanks in no small part to the hotel, the chef and one particular bar man who had great patience with my two kids even when it got really busy. Totally relaxing hotel, really friendly staff who seemed to enjoy working there and who made a fuss of my two year old girl. My eight year old son kept opening the curtains in the room so he could look out at Croke Park. Food in both the bar and the bistro was excellent. We were well looked after by the waiters and waitresses. Breakfast too was first class with loads of choice, plenty of fresh fruit and juices. The room was spotlessly clean and very modern. It was so good the only bad thing I could say about it was that there was no sound on the big screen when they were showing the Cork versus Down game later that evening. You cant not enjoy staying here.",5,2011,08,12
211,"Excellent service, Great accommodations.","We just stayed at the Croke Park Hotel for a week, and could not really have been happier with it.

Because my wife and I were honeymooning in Dublin, and I wanted everything to go smoothly, I called two days ahead to make sure the reservation was confirmed and to inform them that our flight would have us arriving at the hotel around 10am.  I was told that it would not be a problem to arrive early.  When we arrived, we were upgraded to their executive level which got us free continental breakfast every morning as well as a free drink for each of us from the bar every evening.  And when we got to our room, there was champagne waiting for us on ice.  A very thoughtful touch.

Overall, the stay was great, with no problems whatsoever.  The only colorful occurrence happened midway through our stay when there was a GAA playoff game between Dublin and Tyrone, which had the hotel packed full of people.  We though that the noise might be a problem, but not at all.  The room was quiet and even the people who the packed bar and restaurant area after the game were very courteous.  There is even free parking for hotel patrons, which we had to avail ourselves of one evening when we returned too late from Galway and the cliffs of Moher to return our rental car.

My only complaint would be that they should not completely fill the mini-bar with items so that guests can use it to put in leftover food or drinks they may have.  Other than that, the Croke Park Hotel is absolutely superb.  I will recommend it to anyone traveling to Dublin, and my wife and I plan on returning at some point in the future.",5,2011,08,12
211,Great staff great breakfast,Had a great stay and a problem with check in was sorted very competantly when it was brought to the attention of the manager. Its a bit of a walk to the city centre and a taxi for three will cost about ten euro. staff very informative about the area. only gribe is lack of a pool,4,2011,08,11
211,Excellent Hotel,"Great hotel in a unusual location opposite croke park stadium, which I did not plan on seeing but excellent being so near.  Hotel decor is excellent and modern and near to town center (10 mins tops) 5 mins away from Zoo (Not impressive save your money).

Hotel had great breakfast room on forth floor which was complimentary, If we was going to this country again this would be the place we use.",5,2011,08,10
211,"Absolutely fantastic, Highly recommended","We stayed 2 nights over the weekend of the 6/7th August.  We booked based on the great reviews, plus we got a great price on the rooms.

The hotel is fantastic, the service is top notch, FANTASTIC BEDS, and great breakfasts.

The Hotel's location is further out of the town centre than a number of the other big hotels, however do not be put off by this.  Its an easy 10 minute walk in to town, or an easy 10 euro cab ride.

Well worth the money, Book here, you wont be dissappointed",5,2011,08,08
211,Nice hotel in the sports area of Dublin,"This was the last hotel we stayed in on our tour of Ireland. This hotel is very contemporary in style. The room was small but functional. The bathroom size was average. The shower would not go hot (just barely lukewarm), so we ended up taking baths (the bath water got hot). The beds were comfortable. When we stayed there, there were sports teams staying there too, and I was worried it would get too loud. But, the walls must be thick and we were not disturbed all night. A negative was that there was a 2 euro charge to call a free number from the room phone, so I went to the lobby to make the call from the pay phone for free. The hotel is literally RIGHT ACROSS the street from the giant stadium, so if you go here to see a game, it is a great location. This is not a place to stay to sight see Dublin.",3,2011,08,02
211,PERFECT!,"I'll keep this review pretty short and simple: If you're looking for something thats excellent value for money, but you're also used to a touch of luxury, go for this one!
Its not in the best location, which is okay because actually the bar, food and in-room dining are very reasonably priced and to a very good standard, but the hotel itself is lovely. Some of the cosiest rooms and public areas I have experienced, and most definitely the best breakfast!
Enjoy!",5,2011,07,31
211,Great accommodations!,"This was the first stay during a week-long vacation.  Our flight arrived at 6:00 am, so we were at the hotel well before check-in time.  The staff was extremely friendly and did their best to let us check-in before the standard time.  Everyone was friendly and helpful.  The rooms were clean and comfortable.  Breakfast was included with our vacation package, and we were not disappointed.  The only negative was that we were not right in the downtown area of Dublin.  It was a 15 minute walk into town.  However, we would stay here again.",4,2011,07,30
211,Excellent Value and hospitality!,This hotel started our Irish vacation and we were quite pleased with our stay. The room was very comfortable with many amenities and an excellent bathroom. I would definitely choose the Croke again if I came to Dublin.,5,2011,07,30
211,Boy Were We Nicely Surprised,"Dublin Croke was one of the hotels we stayed at with our family on a round the world trip. I had no idea what to expect beyond the fact that it was close to a “stadium” which initially cause some concern about the neighborhood. We got off the airport bus and walked about 6 blocks and came upon this wonderful hotel!  up to that point in the trip we had stayed at about 16 hotels in various parts of the world and for the most part were really put off with how much it cost us and what we are getting, from London to Cairo to Athens to Rome. The Croke Park,  by contrast was such a wonderful exception. The rooms are modern and clean. The staff are excellent. Free Wi-Fi. And great food. At that point in our trip, it was the best hotel that we had experienced. Having now completed around the world trip, we rated as the 2nd best hotel.  highly recommended",5,2011,07,29
211,"Fantastic location, staff & facilities - hard to fault!","We have stayed here several times now and have never found fault with anything! The rooms are a good size, showers roomy and with good power, beds nicely firm. Only downside is the room lighting is too poor to read for any length of time. Even one good reading lamp would make all the difference. Breakfast is really good with plenty of variety to suit all tastes. Decent bar food available as well as the restaurant if you don't want a big meal. Highly recommended.",4,2011,07,29
211,A lovely hotel in the shadow of the great Croke Park stadium,"A lovely hotel in Jones Road at the entrance to Croke Park.  Excellent location for attending a match,concert or just a weekend away.  As it was snowing we were greeted on arrival at reception by mulled wine which was a lovely touch!  Rooms were to a very high standard.  There was a real buzz in the bar yet tables were well spaced and avoided intrusion. The food in the restaurant is also of a very high standard with a large choice. Within easy walking distance of the city centre or s just a short taxi  ride.  We used Supervalu Get Awy Break stamps and the deal was €219 for a weekend for 2, bb&evening dinner.  Great value for money.  The only downfall of this hotel in my opinion is that there is no swimming pool.",4,2011,07,28
211,A fine but not entirely convenient place to stay,"This hotel is around 15 minutes from Dublin Airport, across the street from Croke Park Stadium.  The rooms are well-appointed and quiet, and the executive floor rooms (an extra 20 euros per night) are very nice indeed.  The hotel is roughly 2 miles from most of Dublin's attractions (Trinity College, Temple Bar, etc) - it's a pleasant 30 minute walk, but it's not right in the middle of things.  There's a decent Italian restaurant two blocks up from the hotel, but no other eating establishments in the immediate area. We ate one breakfast and one dinner at the hotel; both meals were decent but not exceptional.  The staff are very friendly and helpful.  Best of all, we were permitted to check in before 9 a.m, having arrived overnight from JFK.",4,2011,07,28
211,Great Hotel in Dublin,"The Croke Park Hotel had everything we needed for a wonderful stay in Dublin.  The rooms were well stocked with a hair dryer, shampoo, hand soap, robes, slippers and a comfy bed.  The free wireless is only available on the upgraded floor but we were able to use the free wireless in the main lobby rooms.  The restaurant and bar was a great place to pick up a meal when we were done site seeing and the full (and free) breakfast was amazing.  All in all, a great place to stay.",5,2011,07,27
211,"Food excellent, room comfy but entertainment non existent","Stayed here for the second time this year. First stay was not quite what I expected from a hotel with such a good name. Stayed again on 24/7/11 but glad to say that this time it was perfect. Again the dinner was delicious and breakfast also. The bedroom was comfortable and a good nights sleep. 

One criticism is that there is no bar music or entertainment on site. Surely it would not be too much to ask to have a guy with a guitar in a corner to get the guests in form. Did not hang around the bar as a bit clinical.",4,2011,07,26
211,Warm and friendly staff and a very pleasant hotel,"We had access to the executive lounge, where we could get complimentary tea and coffee as well as fruit juices. Great for the business traveller, but we didn't use it much apart from when we returned to our room early evening to find it was still being serviced. To be fair we were not out til late morning. 
The rooms were comfortable and clean. We had a couple of drinks in the bar each evening, which was spacious an also very comfortable. Many people have commented about the location. We didn't find it a problem, and actually enjoyed our 20min stroll into town each day. You can always get a taxi when returning at night if you don't fancy walking. We had a meal in the Italian restaurant just further up the street one evening which we would also recommend. ",4,2011,07,22
211,Very Nice Hotel At A Very Reasonable Price,"I had a prepaid room for 90 euros a night, and it was a very high 4* standard, exceptional for the price.  The only drawback is it's not very central to Dublin, about a non-scenic 15-20 minute walk or 8-10 euro cab ride to O'Connell Street.  As you can guess it's right across from the huge Croke Park stadium for gaelic sports events (& concerts).  There's not much around the hotel as far as sightseeing or even pubs or restaurants, but the hotel bar & restaurant are pretty good.",5,2011,07,21
211,Excellent Stay,"This hotel is excellent. From the moment I went in the staff were very friendly and made sure I was satisfied straight away. My mini bar was not open when I got to the room but once I rang reception they had someone up in minutes to solve the problem. The room was extremely luxurious, the height of comfort. The CD player was brilliant. The room was spotless as was the ensuite. Great space in the room and ensuite. The room was very quiet and no noise could be heard outside. The air conditioning came in very handy too. The free car parking was excellent and I could leave my car there and have peace of mind that it was ok. The prices were very reasonable. Food was lovely and not over priced I must say. Its in a great location and very easy to access. Free internet in the room was a big hit too. I was in Dublin for an exam and the hotel experience made the whole process a much easier experience. Top marks to all in the hotel. The only fault (if I had to have some would be: more lighting available in the room and possibly a bath in the ensuite as well. It would have been nice to come after a stressful exam to relax in a bath, but thats all. Couldn't fault it really)",5,2011,07,21
211,O.K.-nothing exceptional though,"I've been to this hotel only 1 night, on 12 July 2011, as a member of an organized tour group to Ireland, so take this into consideration. I got a spacious clean room for two, with 2 twin beds, although I was single and the bed was comfortable. In the clean bathroom the marble shelf is too small to put things on, but you can manage it if you are not too meticulous. There are both a shower and a bath tab, both clean and the shower works fine. The breakfast was a buffet of full English breakfast and it was o.k. There is no Wi-fi, but there is a DVD player and a radio with a remote control.",3,2011,07,21
211,Lovely Hotel - definitely recommend,"I've stayed at the Croke Park Hotel 3 times for concerts in Croke Park and have always been impressed with the accommodation. 
I stayed in June for the Take That concert and they seemed to have learned alot from previous experiences and did a good value set menu in the restaurant as well.
Only downside was the cost to stay at €399 for one night but as all other hotels were charging at least €200 and were not a stone's throw from the venue we felt it was worth it!
Also the receptionist knocked on our door at 10am and was starting to come into the room to see if we were there which I thought was a bit unprofessional. Its the second time that has happened to me in a Dublin hotel so maybe it's their thing! I will always put up the DND sign before I go to bed from now on!",4,2011,07,20
211,Fantastic stay attributed to excellent management,"To celebrate our anniversary, my husband and I booked a trip through Aerlingus Vacations but I was a little worried after seeing some horrid reviews online regarding Aerlingus Vacations.  The package price seemed too good to be true so I contacted Russell (manager of hotel) to make sure the company was on the up and up and he completely put me at ease and answered any questions I had, even offering suggestions.  Once there, we found the hotel experience was excellent.  The rooms are updated and large by European standards.  The cleaning service was prompt and thorough.  We were left various fruits in the room each day as well as fresh drinking water. The bed was extremely comfortable and we enjoyed coming back to the room each evening. The included full breakfast was terrific and fulfilling.  As far as the area is concerned, we felt completely safe and we mostly walked into the city each day which took about 15 minutes - an easy walk.  Each time we encountered Russell in the lobby he took the time to acknowledge us and ask if everything was okay.  As avid travelers, it's not difficult to understand why this hotel is rated #3 out of a couple of hundred Dublin hotels....superb management.  Kudos to Russell and staff for providing us a home away from home.  Thanks for everything you did.  I would return there in a heartbeat.",5,2011,07,19
211,Excellent Hotel,"We stayed at the Croke Park Hotel on the last two days of our nine day Irish Adventure Tour.  This was the best hotel by far.  Staff and service were excellent.  Room was neat, clean, and had air conditioning.  Food was very good.  Not in the best scenic neighborhood, but close to airport.  I recommend this hotel highly.",5,2011,07,18
211,Great Hotel!  Wonderful Staff!,"My wife and I along with another couple stayed there for 5 nights while scouting out Dublin.  Simply incredible stay.  The rooms were clean and great, the hotel staff very helpful, and a great breakfast with lots of variety for our American palates.",5,2011,07,18
211,THIS HOTEL CANNOT BE FAULTED IN ANY WAY IT'S SUPERB!! AMAZING HOTEL! WE LOVED IT!! GREAT DUBLIN ZOO FAMILY PACKAGE DEAL!,"We stayed here last night. After checking in yesterday we all went to Aquazone in Blanchardstown which was only a short drive from the hotel. When we returned to the hotel after working up an appetite, we all enjoyed a 3course meal in the sideline Bistro in the Hotel (this meal is included in your package)!! The service was superb and the saff were very friendly, the kids were treated with equal service and high standards too.   The meal was Amazing and the best we have ever experienced!!!!!  After dinner we retired to bed where we watched a movie from our room and enjoyed a very comfortable nights sleep.  The full irish breakfast in the morning in the wonderful Sideline Bistro, buffet style, again was first class!! (also included in your package) This has set us up for the day where we can enjoy our Dublin Zoo family pass (again all part of your package) after a spot of sightseeing in Dublin city centre.  Whilst our room looked onto Croke park there were no events there this weekend, therefore it was a very nice and a quiet stay, however if there had of been Im sure we all, especially the kids would have enjoyed watching he hustle and bustle and events/comings and goings of the stadium!!!
This hotel cannot be faulted in any way whatsoever!! Clean, spacious, modern, comfortable, impeccable food accompanied by fanastic service!! SIMPLY PERFECT AND LOVED BY THE WHOLE FAMILY!!",5,2011,07,17
211,An excellent resting place to visit a terrific City,"The Hotel was one of my best choices (if not my best) and coming from my wife that must be true.  The staff were excellent from reception to leaving nothing and i mean nothing was to much trouble.  From directing us to the great sites to transport around the city. The positioning of the hotel from the ferry was so simple to follow just follow your sat nav.  The rooms and decor were 5* +.  Breakfast was fantastic and spoil for choice.
I and wife will certainly be back and will recommend to one and all.",5,2011,07,15
211,Happy in Dublin,"I was so pleased I choose this hotel. The Croke Park was the right choice for us. Our room was perfect. The bathroom was enormous and very well stocked. Breakfast was way nicer than it had to be. So civilized. We enjoyed the lobby pub in the evening. It was the start of season so the Hop on Hop Off bus stopped at the front door a few times a day.  A cab into the city was only about 10euro any other time. You must be advised that  the hotel is outside the city center, but that just means they try so much harder.",4,2011,07,11
211,"Great Dublin hotel, albeit slightly off the beaten track","Room (spacious, quiet, we got one with a view), service (caesar salad at 10 PM on a Sunday!), breakfast (you can eat all day), all great, really, especially if you can get it for under 100 EUR as it sometimes happens. 

Drawbacks: city centre is a good 20 minute walk away, and the place is pretty ugly :) but if you can get over that, definitely a good place to stay!",4,2011,07,11
211,Professional environment; we'd stay there again,"When my wife and I arrived from an overnight flight, we hoped they'd let us check in early.  The staff was fast to accomodate our request and quickly got us to our room for some much needed sleep before heading out into Dublin.  The room was very comfortable and ultra clean.  We could not have asked for more.  The food was very good.  We ate both breakfast and dinner there.  Quite the variety to chose from.  The parking is below the hotel, which is very convenient.  The hotel is located in a quiet area, which is very nice.  You will have drive to get to City Center for all the sights, food, and pubs.  My wife and I would definitely stay there again.",5,2011,07,09
211,Superb will recommend to friends,"Excellent service and very friendly staff attended to all our needs and requests immediately
ie extra towels, internet access, taxi and advise on places to visit",5,2011,07,09
211,Great surprise for short stay in Dublin,"Added one night in Dublin to Septre tour package.  Croke Park Hotel was the only choice.  We were treated great from the moment we entered the lobby.  Service was fast and efficient.  The room was clean and lovely.  Breakfast was included and was great, the staff in the restaurant made the meal special.  All our questions were answered with a smile.  We walked from the hotel to downtown Dublin and back.  We'll stay here again!",5,2011,07,08
211,"great sleep, the wifi was free and was a perfect signal, the room was huge, the insulation was superb and staff great","We booked for one night through Expedia for £70 and ended up with a B&B rate, a deluxe room and the 4th floor complementary lounge with snacks and drinks.  We had a great sleep, the wifi was free and was a perfect signal, the room was huge, the insulation was superb and the staff were fantastic.  Obviously that rate would not apply when a concert or football match was taking place in the stadium but with free underground parking I couldn't find fault with the hotel.  The decor and the layout were very smart. Some have said that the location is not ideal for the city centre and thats perhaps a consideration (also, its not the best of areas immediately around the hotel) but that aside it was perfect for us.  The very help hotel concierge chap (I think from from Eastern Europe) arranged for two bikes for us  the next day and we cycled down the quays to the O2 and the U2 studio and then all the way back along the quays to the magnificent Phoenix Park.  It was sunny and we had a great time.",5,2011,07,08
211,Lovely Hotel,We stayed here for 2 nights midweek.  Free secure car parking.  Our room was modern and very comfortable.  We had dinner in the restaurant our first night there and the food was great and there was nice atmosphere.  Good breakfast also.  Only about 15 minutes walk from O'Connell St (City Centre).  Quick check in & out and staff very helpful & friendly.  Would definitely stay in this hotel again.,5,2011,07,08
211,A good place to stay if no game's on,"The Croke Park is a very lovely. Good breakfast, rooms, access to Dublin city(walkable, but take the Hop-on shuttle from the hotel in to save your energy). It is literally right across the large(90,000) Croke Park stadium. WE were fortunate there was no event that night but you'd be wise to check.",4,2011,07,08
211,"Great staff, quiet, comfortable",After flying over the pond this was the quiet comfort I needed.  I enjoyed the outstanding breakfast and fun evening bar atmosphere.,4,2011,07,05
211,Absolutely love this hotel! Will continue to visit again and again!,"My boyfriend and I are just back from a two night stay at the Croke Park Hotel. It's is the fourth time we have stayed here and it remains our favourite place to stay in Dublin.
Location wise you are about 10 minutes walk away from O'Connell street which is grand because you arent directly in the centre of the hustle and bustle. We have never found the distance a problem. A taxi into town is around 6 euros. 

The hotel itself is beautiful! Nice spacious rooms which are immaculately clean all the time. It is always quiet at night. We were upgraded to the executive floor this time which was great as it was free but wouldn't be worth any extra money if you are thinking of going for the executive rooms. The only difference is that you have access to the executive lounge which provides free tea, coffee, water and fruit. 

The staff are absolutely fabulous. So courteous and helpful all the time, they cannot do enough for you! 

The bar has a fantastic selection of beverages on offer. Nice chilled, relaxed atmosphere in comfortable surroundings. The restaurant serves a small but well rounded menu, there should be something to suit all tastes. Breakfast has a vast variety to suit everyone.

The only negative thing that I have to say is that when sporting events are taking place, spectators do take over the hotel facilities and communal areas. This is obviously part and parcel of the location with Croke Park literally across the road. This is slightly off putting as the majority of people in the bar/restaurant were not guests at the hotel. This has happened to us on previous visits and we did feel slightly like outsiders. 

All in all I would recommend this hotel to anyone of any age group. ",5,2011,07,04
211,An excellent hotel,"Stayed for one night June 21st. Chose the hotel initially for the free secure parking but was very pleased with all the hotel. Polite staff, clean, tidy and well decorated rooms with a very comfortable bed and proper air con. Breakfast was good but didn't try the restaurant in the evening. Yes it is a 20min walk into town but we had no problem with that. The Dublin tour bus collects passengers at regular intervals right outside the hotel and will drop you at O Connell St if walking is a big problem for you.( you will have to walk back). I would definitely stay here again when in Dublin.",5,2011,07,01
211,Sparkling modernity but remote location from Dublin city centre,"Beautifully clean, modern hotel with good service but located well away from the city centre. OK for stadium next door. Wi-fi only in lobby but computer-cable connection in the rooms. Very comfortable. ",4,2011,06,30
211,Great concierge service,"My wife and i stayed in the hotel on a recent visit to dublin for a neil diamond concert. The hotel was easily reached by taxi from the main bus depot. The concierge was extremely helpful in showing us the way into town, we had the choice of taxi or walk. We walked and 15 minutes on a pleasant saturday morning left us at the top of o connell street, the directions were great. The concierge also looked after our bags on the sunday and oranised a taxi to the aviva for the concert at a very reasonable rate. We were on a package from the supervalu company and although the bar prices were somewhat pricey the package was a good deal all in all. We had a very clean and spacious room, the mini bar was automated, (and worked well), i was somewhat suprised because i felt the pricing of the wines and spirits in the mini bar was very reasonable. The staff generally were very efficient, courteous and helpful. The bar staff need a little more training on how to manage the queue at the bar, but this was overall a minor detail on a very enjoyable stay. We would certainly stay again.",4,2011,06,28
211,"Lovely hotel, well presented, helpful staff.","A good deal and so ideally suited for games/events at Croke Park - only disappointing part was it was a 11-13 pound taxi trip each way into the bar area of Dublin.  You cant visit Ireland without taking in the atmosphere of the irish bars but allow for an extra 25 pounds in either transport costs or car parking costs which apparently are about the same.  However in compensation, the rooms were a decent size, the beds great, bathrooms well serviced with nice amenity products along with excellent staff and great breakfasts.
Depending what you were going to Dublin for, I would heartily recommend this hotel.",4,2011,06,28
211,"Really nice, but kinda far from center of things","Mh and i stayed at the Croke park for two nights while we were traveling around Ireland.
We arrived around 5 am on an early flight and the hotel was great about holding our bags and we even got to check in early around 1pm.  It was about a 15-20 minute walk from the center of things, but we didn't mind too much.  The room was very nice, and we really enjoyed breakfast every morning.  The free internet access and free parking was also a big bonus to us.  also the staff was very friendly and helpful  Overall i would definitely recommend the hotel as long as you don't mind walking a little bit.",4,2011,06,27
211,Great place but a bit out of the way,"Very nice hotel and appreciate that they had free parking and internet ( and surprisingly reasonable bar prices).   Unfortunately, there wasn't much nearby.   I knew from the reviews that we were 20 min walk from tourist sites but hoped to have a few bustling neighborhood pubs nearby.  Unfortunately there just wasn't much nearby and I hadn't thought about walking 20 min in the rain...a relatively common occurance here it seems.  But great value...just factor in cab fare ($10euro to town)",4,2011,06,26
211,loved this hotel,"My husband and I just spent a night at this hotel.I chose it after reading some very good reviews and I can tell you that I wasn't disappointed. When we arrived the reception staff were lovely especially Jennifer. Our room was very nice with a very comfortable bed, the pillows were best I ever slept on in a hotel. We had a delicious breakfast the following morning. I have highly recommended it to a lot of friends since we returned,and I will definately be returning myself soon.",5,2011,06,24
211,Nice hotel - bit of a walk downtown,"My hubby and I visited Dublin in May and stayed at the Croke Park Hotel.  The rooms are a bit small by American standards and I would have like a bit more storage space, but overall were well designed and maintained.  The lobby was beautiful, the staff was friendly and helpful and we had a good dinner in the restaurant one night (both the lamb shank and the salmon were very good).  It does take a little walk to get to City Centre - about 6 blocks - but if you don't mind walking it's not bad.  There are a couple restaurants close by, but more in City Centre.  If you don't mind the walk - go for it!",4,2011,06,23
211,Be careful of room location!,We stayed for 3 nights for Take That concert. We paid a much higher room rate because of concert but unfortunately had a terrible room - - G001. It was next to mens toilet which was opened up to concert goers. The traffic going to the toilet was heavy (and very noisy). Location is great if going to Stadium. Reception area nice but staff unhelpful. The room seemed to be 'make-shift'. No mini-bar. I was disappointed but didn't like to complain - based on other reviews about lovely rooms - maybe I should have done! Food was great and good value. I would suggest that if given a 'G' room then ask for another room.,3,2011,06,22
211,First Class,"We stayed just the 1 night and I feel we got such great Value for money.
 Hotel is very comfortable- our room was Spaceous with a great Queen Bed. Mini Bar drinks were very reasonably priced too. Internet Access on TV.
 Had our dinner in the Sideline Bistro & it was wonderful. I had Sea Bass and it was cooked to Perfection. Again top quality food very Reasonably Priced.
 Staff were very friendly & helpful. Our room was spotless. 
We were on the 4th Floor & had access to the Executive Club. This was great. I got up at 6.30 & had a great work out in the Fitness Centre. It was nice to to to the Executive Club for a mini Breakfast & read of the paper.
 When my husband & I went for the Real Breakfast again it was Fantastic. Great choice of Fruits Juices cereals Cold Meats Cheeses & the Full Irish.
 Location too is Perfect. We strolled to the Guinness Storehouse & it took just about 30 minutes. That was nicer than getting a bus or taxi. We strolled on the Board walk & stopped for coffee on the way. I couldnt recommend this hotel highly enough",5,2011,06,21
211,"Average hotel, not a great location.","Unless you are going to the the football ground, this location isn't ideal, its quite a walk to the the main centre of the city or a taxi ride, aswell as this the area itself is quite run down and grey. However, the hotel itself is adequate, nothing special and quite dated, but certainly comfortable and clean. The room was large, great bathroom and quiet on the evening, unfortunately the room overlooked concrete. The staff were friendly and accommodating, but overall the place lacks charm.",3,2011,06,19
211,We loved it!!!,"My friend and I stayed in this hotel last weekend, we loved the hotel since we arrived, receptionists were very friendly, Shaun in special,who offered  us an upgrade for a very good price, the suite we got was amazing, very nice view, very very comfortable beds, complimentary bottle of water, we got a complimentary drink at the bar too (as part of the upgrade) and we were supposed to get the turn down service too, but we didn´t get it, it wasn´t a big deal but we wanted to let them know as we both work in a 5 star hotel and attention to detail It´s very important, the receptionist gave us her apologizes on behalf of the housekeeping staff  and gave us a  discount, which I think it was very good of them, the concierge was very good and friendly. Breakfast was nice but one thing that we didn`t like and made us feel a bit uncomfortable was the waitress or the girl in charge of breakfast at the lounge, she was very friendly with the airlines crew that obviously stayed at the hotel everyday and did a really good job for them, she was very nice and kind with them but she never even looked at other guests that were having breakfast at the same time and place, maybe is a special service that crew members get? I don`t know but I'm sure all guests were that day at the same time having breakfast felt a bit awkward.You can walk from the centre to this hotel but It´s a long walk, a taxi normally will cost 10 Euro from the hotel to the centre. In general we loved our stay in this hotel and we would love to come back!!!",5,2011,06,18
211,"Very happy, lived up to expectations.","This hotel is fabulous. Great welcome and very genuine. Helpful reception staff. Room was a triple even though I booked a single. Bed really comfortable, slept like a baby.  Free wired internet was a great bonus, and was much faster than other Dublin hotels I have stayed in. I also appreciated the secure underground parking. The choice, variety and quality at breakfast was really excellent. The only quibble I would have is their porridge! It took 15 minutes to arrive and I had finished my brreakfast by the time it was served - this despite asking three different servers. I tasted it (just for research purposes!) it but it was undercooked and awful. Why can't hotels cook a small batch of porridge every morning and not leave it to the microwave to do the job. Other than this minor episode, everything else was very professional.",5,2011,06,16
211,cant wait to retrurn,"we stayed in this hotel for a weekend break with friends. it was our wedding anniversary and we were upgraded to a room on the 4th floor with access to the executive lounge were we got free non alcoholic drinks and fruit. our friends had a large room with a double and single bed and a seperate dressing area. the breakfast was the best we have had and we have stayed in a lot of hotels. yes dublin was expensive to eat out and drink but we were expecting this before we went there. and yes we had to walk for around 20 mins to get to the city centre or take a taxi for around 13 euros, but the hotel and the staff made up for the negatives. also guests were able to park free in the underground car park. the hotal was clean and modern and the staff were brilliant just what we look for in a hotel. we will be back soon.",5,2011,06,16
211,Best Value Ever,"My wife and I were not disappointed after choosing this hotel based on TA ratings. We have travelled extensively throughout Europe. Without doubt Croke Park exceeded every aspect over all the hotels I've stayed in. Courtious staff, quality service, facilities and best value for money. I could go on, free internet, room safe etc etc.
If you're thinking about a visit to Dublin, leisure or business, this place is a cast iron choice.",5,2011,06,15
211,Very Nice hotel for the price,"This was a very nice hotel for the price.  A little far from the city center, so I would suggest buying the hop-on-hop off bus tour that stops by the hotel to use as your transportation inot the city center. Otherwise taking a cab in and out of the city gets a little pricey and it is a little too far to walk.  Definitely see the Jail & Guiness if you have time. Oh and there is free breakfast at the hotel, which is also very nice when you're staying in such an expensive city.",4,2011,06,14
211,Excellent value for a very nice place,"We truly enjoyed the Croke Park hotel.  The room was very nice, clean, modern - great amenities, and the service was impeccable.  The location is a bit of a hike to public transport, but a cab was very cheap to city center and we learned a lot from the cab drivers!  Our booking included the breakfast buffet, which far exceeded our expectations, and again included the great service we found everywhere at this property.",5,2011,06,13
211,Fine hotel deserving of its tripadvisor rating,"I spent one night here and I really couldn't fault it, I wish all hotels where like this, everything about the place is to a five star standard yet at a 4 star price. I would highly recommend to all...",5,2011,06,13
211,Fabulous hotel,"This hotel is absolutely gorgeous. The room was very big, spotlessly clean and had all mod cons. The service was impeccable and the staff were very friendly. We also had lunch in the restaurant and both the food and staff were commendable. We will definitely be back here again.",5,2011,06,09
211,"Fine enough hotel, bad location for American tourist.",This hotel was our first nite stay for the package we purchased. It's really far from temple bar. We walked (during the day) and caught a bus (1.25 euros) to temple bar. But later found out that the neighborhood is one of the more dangerous in Dublin. Taxi for four from temple bar is 14 euros. I would recommend getting hotel closer. As for the room it was fine and clean. The breakfast was ok. The coffee was good :),3,2011,06,08
211,"Clean, comfortable and exceptional staff.","We were here for two nights in early June, 105 Euro/night for a huge double room. It was spotlessly clean, quiet, and everything was new and up to date. The hotel had a very business/conferencey feel to it which is probably great for some. Location was OK ... about a 10 minute walk from Connolly station through an unexciting area of Dublin. One thing that really made this amazing was the free loan of bikes to hotel guests - just 5 minutes from the hotel are bike paths that take you all the way to Howth. The best part was the outstanding concierge and really professional staff at this hotel.",5,2011,06,07
211,Very very good stay,"To begin they responded fairly quick to requests I had on my reservation through email, before U got there. Check in was friendly and helpful. The hotel and rooms are new and beautiful. The location is a 15 min walk to the action in dublin. The restaurant was good. The cosmo were great..",5,2011,06,06
211,Hidden Gem,"Just stayed at the Croke with my husband and daughter. Overall, very clean facility, house keeping was very courteous and staff respectful and ready to assist with questions and requests. Pros: Great value for the money, great staff, easy to navigate hotel floor plan, VERY quiet heating/cooling system in room and decent bar/relaxation area. Cons: Location is in the far end of the city across the street from Croke Park Stadium in a rural neighborhood, not close to any attractions and catching a cab can be tricky if none happen to be around, thus making the rates vary. The bus (16a) and train (DART-Connelly Station) stops are within walking distance (2 different locations) but you better have good walking shoes because the walk is at least 8-15 minutes for those options OR walking to O'Connell street which would be the nearest ""hub"" for any tourist activities. Even so, we had a great time and after a long day we were able to relax in comfort.",4,2011,06,02
211,Excellent Hotel- great value and great experience,My partner and I stayed here for 2 nights recently. We were very impressed with the level of service and the clean modern feel to the hotel. The room was immaculate and spacious. The bed was large and so comfortable. We had breakfast the two mornings and the selection available was great. The food was fresh and tasty. We were delighted with the overall experience and will definitely stay at this hotel again the next time we are in Dublin.,5,2011,06,01
211,Very Nice Hotel,"Stayed at the Croke Park for a couple of nights recently. Lovely Hotel and very helpful staff.
A bit out of the way but only a 10 minute walk and was not so much of a problem.
Would recommend especially as the B&B rate was very reasonable.",4,2011,05,31
211,Lovely hotel,"The Croke Park Hotel is lovely, food is A+, Staff are friendly and very helpful, rooms are nice and comfortable and it has free parking for guests - I cannot fault this hotel at all.",5,2011,05,30
211,"An excellent, if slightly out of the way, hotel","My fiance and I stayed here two nights at the beginning and end of our trip to Ireland. The staff were very pleasant and accommodating, and overall we enjoyed our stay quite a bit. The rooms are good-sized for a city hotel, the beds are super-comfy, and the only complaint I have is that there's a lack of adequate lighting in the room itself, which is the only place to blow dry your hair since the (well-lit) bathroom doesn't have an outlet. Speaking of, great shower and very nice new fittings in the bath. Also, the hotel's breakfast was just so-so, but it was included with our package, so we couldn't argue with that. The location is great if you're seeing a match at Croke Park, but it's a good 15-minute walk into the heart of the city for some of the more touristy things and restaurants. Then again, it was nice to get a bit of exercise and have a great hotel on a quiet street.",4,2011,05,26
211,Our first taste of Irish hospitality,"Our first night in Ireland was spent at Croke Park Hotel as part of a tour package with Sceptre Tours.  The hotel was beautiful - rooms were very comfortable.  We travelled with another couple and had booked two rooms, however, upon arrival, only one room was ready.  We were quickly given another room, a smoking one which I was a little concerned about, but after a quick check it was very clean and no smoke smell at all!
The concierge was extremely helpful in pointing out good places to visit, how to access the bus tours, good restaurants and pubs, etc.  Breakfast was terrific - staff went out of their way to make us feel at home.  Our table had a bit of a wobble to it and two staff members immediately saw this and shimmed it right up for us so it was level.  Overall a terrific experience and one that I hope we are able to repeat soon!",5,2011,05,26
211,"Modern, clean hotel with great service","Stayed here recently on a trip to Ireland with my mother and brother.  We arrived at 5 am in the morning after a day's worth of traveling and red eye flights.  The staff was extremely accomodating and let us check in right away since they had a room available.  That was a God sent as we were exhausted and were able to get in some sleep before we started our trek through Ireland.

The hotel is not in the city center but it is an easy 15 minute walk or quick cab ride.  They had free wifi that was accessible in the common areas.  We ate at the restaurant one night which was really good and the breakfast buffet was also great.  We stayed here through an Aer Lingus travel package.  Highly recommend.",5,2011,05,23
211,Lovely Hotel,"We booked The Croke Park Hotel after it was recommended by a friend and we were not disappointed!!  It was fantastic, immaculately clean 4th floor room with King size bed, massive bathroom and complimentary bathrobes and slippers.  Every member of staff was pleasant and could not be more helpful.  Breakfast was great with a wide selection, all tasting fresh.  Hotel is about a 20 minute walk from the centre but this was not a problem for us.  There is also the option of the hop on hop off bus which we used and taxi's.  All in all a lovely hotel which we will definitely visit again.",5,2011,05,23
211,Excellent value and service,My second time staying here and it certainly did not disappoint.  This hotel is so easy to get to and underground parking is provided free.  Check in was welcoming.  Received hot towels to refresh . Was asked to remove them from a plate at reception. Would suggest some type of little bag to be able to take them to the bedrooms rather than juggling  them with our luggage.   Just a comment ...not really a complaint . Asked for quiet room  with 2 double beds.   Room 134 just ideal.  Bathroom and shower were spotless.  No trouble for reception to book taxi for later in night.  Availed of 25euro voucher towards our meal in bar on that evening. Both of us hugely impressed with the steak .   Breakfast had a lot of healthy options.  Overall it was a very pleasant stay.  Will return.,5,2011,05,21
211,Perfect birthday!,"Just back from stay in croke park hotel and will definately return. We stayed on the fourth floor with access to executive lounge, would highly recommend this if only for the nespressos! The room we stayed in was quiet and very comfortable, the bathrobe and slippers helped with the comfort...we got a taxi into town, waiting less than five minutes for its arrival.  Breakfast was delicious, and, self service which we find great. The selection and layout worked very well. All staff in the hotel (which we dealt with) were very friendly and professional. Perfect bithday pressie.......",5,2011,05,21
211,Fabulous Holte - Croke Park in Dublin!,"What a great hotel - almost boutique and modern - but homey.  The staff was great, friendly and accomodating.  We upgraded to the club level too!  Definitely worth the splurge!",5,2011,05,20
211,Excellent place to start our stay in Ireland,"The best thing was that they welcomed us and had a lovely room available when we arrived at about 7:30 in the morning.  We walked everywhere the 2 days we were in Dublin and never felt uncomfortable walking through the neighborhood toward downtown.  Bed was perfect...loved the room darkening curtains!  Excellent breakfasts....Those homemade croissants, warm from the oven were impossible to resist.  Highly recommend this hotel.",5,2011,05,19
211,"Great Hotel, Fantastic Staff","We've just returned from a fabulous weekend in Dublin, made even more special by our stay and the staff at Croke Park Hotel. From the upgrade we received when we arrived (and use of the Executive Lounge), to the unexpected complimentary bottle of sparkling wine delivered to our room - we were thoroughly spoilt. The Queen is visiting Dublin this week for her first state visit; she should consider staying at Croke Park Hotel, because we certainly got treated like royalty!",5,2011,05,16
211,Birthday treat,"Went for my first visit to Dublin and did a lot of research. We prefer great hotel (even if a walk needed to get to the centre and will be doing this in Corfu later in yr too) and we got it.
Midday check in and check out....very helpful staff, couple of free computers in reception with free printing - great for online board passes for return flight.
Yes not the best area of Dublin but v safe esp as v near a Garda station.
Had room service breakfast both mornings (as birthday treat) and spot on time scale and quality. Mini bar and main bar reasonable prices.  Ice machine / icy water on all floors which I think all hotels should have so u could have your own drinks in the room. 
When hotel knew it was my birthday they surprised me with free strawberry and champagne.  Lovely thought and demonstrates how great the staff are! 
If you do not want to walk use the hop on and off bus that runs through the day at certain times. We did and also walked and got couple of taxis. 
Would recommend to others and go back in a heart beat.",5,2011,05,16
211,"pleasant hotel, handy for the stadium.","We stayed at this hotel for one night on the way home from Cork (via Dublin) and chose it mostly for the fact it was near the car hire place. However, it also turned out to be only about 15 mins walk from the centre of town (which would have been pleasant if it wasn't raining!) Staff were very helpful with telling us things like where the nearest petrol station was, and although there were a couple of minor issues with the room they fixed them immediately. In fact the internet and door handle fixing man was charming and didn't bat an eye at the fact we were holed up in our room with beer and chocolate to watch the Eurovision Song Contest. Bar food was tasty.",4,2011,05,16
211,Fantastic hotel and lovely helpful staff. 5star treatment.,"My wife and I stayed here for an Anniversary and on arrival received a complimentary upgrade with sparkling wine and a welcoming letter from the manager wishing us a nice stay. We have stayed here before and its this sort of go that extra mile attitude to look after your guests that makes us want to return time after time.The hotel itself is lovely but for us its the wonderful friendly staff that set it above and apart from other hotels.The hotel food is excellent and rooms are spacious and kept immaculately. Its not consistantly at or near the top of Tripadvisors Dublin hotel ratings for no good reason. Its easy for expensive hotels to achieve top ratings but the Croke Park achieves this while charging very reasonable room rates.
Would recommend this hotel with a heart and a half to anyone wanting a great hotel without needing to pay sky high Dublin prices.",5,2011,05,16
211,"very smart hotel, walking distance to the city centre","We stayed there as part of a weekend special deal package. This included one dinner in the hotel restaurant - popular and serving very good food. The room was comfortable and a reasonable size but without a decent view. Maid service was very thorough and the room had all the comforts you would expect from a good 4 star hotel. The staff are efficient and helpful. The hotel is popular with coach parties, independent travellers and business guests. Breakfast is generous and buffet style. 
   The hotel is right opposite Croke Park Stadium and about a fifteen / twenty minute walk into the city centre. There's nothing to do in the immediate vicinity of the hotel, in fact the area is a bit grotty. The bar is large and modern in style with big plasma TVs on the wall.
  All in all, it would have been nicer to stay somewhere a little more central and closer to the river. The hotel itself however, is difficult to find any fault with.",4,2011,05,14
211,Fantastic staff!lovely hotel!,"Rooms are lovely, staff are very helpful and polite. Food is beautiful! Breakfast was great! Definitely a good spot to stay for business or pleasure! Great idea to offer movie, popcorn, ice-cream and a soft drink for only€12!",5,2011,05,13
211,a business hotel with a warm welcome,"We got a deal through travelzoo - 2 nights plus dinner on one night - a despite arriving on Easter Saturday and there being 4 GAA league finals across the road at Croke Park we didnt feel the hotel was overwhelmed although the bar was very busy on Sunday night. We had a very nice dinner that night and didnt feel the set menu was any less than what other guests recevied. The portions were generous and we were happy with the choices for each of the three courses.
The room was very comfortable, a good size and the bathroom was well equipped with a bath and large shower. Staff were very friendly and the concierge was helpful and full of good advice. We left the car in the underground carpark and walked everywhere - 15-20 minutes to city centre. Would definitely use again if we could get a deal.",4,2011,05,12
211,Amazing Hotel,I have stayed in many hotel but this is one of the tops in every aspect i got a great deal during the sunday of the may bank holiday. Got a great deal with Otel had already stayed in another hotel for two nights namely the Hilton Dublin Airport which i stay in quite a lot as iam A Hilton cardholder. But everything about this hotel is fabulous. The bathroom has both a bath and walk-in shower. The only quip i have is that internet connection should be free. Will stay here again if i can get a good deal.,5,2011,05,11
211,Probably the best option in Dublin,"Booked the Travelzoo package which included various extras and was great value.
Room:  The room was not  as advertised. Still a very nice room, but instead of a King bed, it contained a standard double and a single. Whilst I can understand the rooms being configured this way, the single bed was surplus to our requirements and just took up valuable floor space. All the usual amenties associated with a business style hotel were provided. Everything was spotlessly clean. The package also included access to the Executive Lounge on the 4th floor (although we had to ask about this) which is nice and handy for a complimentary coffee/soft drink/fresh fruit at any time of the day.
Breakfast: We stayed at the same time as a large conference was taking place. That resulted in no menus available in the breakfast room on the first morning (conference menus from the previous evening were still on the tables) so we were unaware of various options as the staff did not mention them.
Dinner: A set menu dinner was included as part of the package. The choice was quite limited, particularly for me as a vegetarian (I had advised the hotel of this requirement several weeks prior to arrival) The food and service was lovely. It just seemed strange that the restaurant was offering the full menu to other guests not on the package. Many of the meals not included onour set menu were of the same value or even cheaper than we were offered. No allowance could be given against any more expensive options.
Bar: Absolutely full to overflowing with conference attendees. We were unable to find a seat and felt very much the outsiders. The staff were rushed off their feet and the service suffered accordingly. Not at all welcoming, so we left and went elsewhere.
Staff: Friendly and polite, but often seemed a bit pushed. Maybe it was just the effect of the big conference? 
Location: Fantastic location if you are attending Croke Park. About a 15 minute walk to central Dublin. The route is straightforward and whilst the area certainly isn't ""the posh end of town"" it is perfectly safe to walk at any time. There are people outside various buildings having a cigarette, so maybe other guests have felt having to walk past groups a bit intimidating? We are quite happy to walk a reasonable distance and walked to the O2 and also the Guinness Storehouse. although I can accept that this would be too far for some.     
Would certainly return at the right price or if the Travellzoo package is repeated as promised.",4,2011,05,11
211,Great place to start or end your Ireland Vacation,"Everything about this hotel was wonderful.  The staff went out of the way to make you feel welcome.  They said hello just passing in the hall and asked if you needed assistance when you would be in the lobby.  The breakfast was excellent with great choices of fresh fruits and warm entrees as well as pastries and choices of cereal. 
The rooms are spacious, great bathroom with separate bath and shower and best of all unbelievably quiet.  I would recommend this as the best hotel we stayed in on our C I E Tour.",5,2011,05,11
211,Excellent value,"We got a deal through Travel Zoo and were very pleased with it.
Lovely hotel, breakfast buffet lovely and replenished immediately.  Three course dinner included was also very nice. Rooms were excellent, lovely bathroom with walk-in shower and separate bath.

It was a little bit further out than would have liked, but during the daytime the walk was fine.  Would take a taxi in the evening.

Would recommend this hotel without doubt.",5,2011,05,10
211,What more can I add,"I really cannot add anything more to the good things other reviewersw have said about this hotel.  It ticks all the boxes for me.   Only one slight demerit - most days at breakfast there were to teaspoons set with the cup and saucer.   Got a table that wobbled and the waiter wedged a paper napkin under one edge - the napkin was still there the following morning.
Location is out of town, but usually found a taxi waiting on the forecourt. (fare E6)   A 5- minute walk along the towpath of the Royal Canal takes you to bus routes (fare E1.20), and for the energetic a 20 minute walk takes you to the head of O'Connell Street.",5,2011,05,07
211,Fantastic!!!,"We stayed at the Croke Park Hotel to celebrate my daughters 21st birthday, with my sister, and my daughters two best friends.  We all had the most wonderful time.  As soon as we arrived the management and staff were so welcoming and had our room ready within half an hour of arriving at 9.40am.  The room was not supposed to be available until 2pm!  They had even decorated my daughters room with balloons and banner and cake!   Everything about the hotel was wonderful, the management and staff, the food, lounge areas, restaurant.  The breakfast and evening meal were outstanding.  Thankyou for making our visit to Dublin truly memorable.  I would definately recommend this hotel.  Thankyou again",5,2011,05,05
211,Gorgeous hotel,"I love this hotel! Lovely staff, clean and comfortable rooms and a great breakfast. The location is great too...10 mins from the city centre. I will keep coming back.",5,2011,05,05
211,Will keep coming back!,"We've stayed in this hotel on a number of occaisons over the last year or so, and it a truly excellent hotel. From the brilliant location to the gorgeous spacious rooms, I have not one bad word I can say about it, so much so that we stay at the Croke Park even if  it is not the most convenient hotel for our visit to Dublin.  The food is always of a really high standard, and the breakfast is always brilliant.  And of course the staff....what can I say, the staff are always truly brillaint - they just cannot do enough for you, and it really makes this hotel stand out. 
Stay here if you get the chance, you won't be disappointed...",5,2011,05,04
211,"Great hotel, helpful staff","My fiance and I stayed at the Croke Park Hotel for 2 nights as part of a Travelzoo deal, which included dinner and an upgrade to an Executive Room on the 4th floor. We had dinner in the hotel on the first night which was lovely, and we breakfasted in the Executive Lounge on the 4th floor which was also very good. The 4th floor bedrooms have wi-fi access which was handy, both the bedroom and bathroom were very clean and comfortable, and you had everything you needed. There was a small but adequate fitness suite, and free access to internet-enabled computers and a printer, so we were able to check in to our flights online and print off our boarding passes. It was more corporate than some of the other hotels we have stayed in, but what set it apart was the service we received from the staff.

At the time of our stay, I was recovering from an operation on my leg, so I had made contact with the hotel before our visit, just to make some enquiries about accessibility & to check what local healthcare facilities were available. I had a very quick and informative response from Sean, one of the hotel managers, who was really helpful, both before and during our stay. A measure of excellent customer service is when you feel you are being looked after before you have even walked through the door, and in this instance, I can say the Croke Park Hotel came up trumps!!! Sean was also there to greet us when we checked in, and I truly felt as though I was looked after throughout my stay, and given the traumatic few weeks I'd had beforehand, it was sorely needed and immensely appreciated! 

Getting to the hotel from the airport was easy - the 16 or 41 buses stop at the Drumcondra Rail Station, which is a 5min walk from the hotel. Given I wasn't as mobile as usual, I was concerned about the distance from the city centre, but we got buses everywhere and we didn't have any problems at all. The only thing to note is that the buses do require you to have the exact fare, which is around 2 euros. It was a bit of a chore making sure we had change all the time(!) but on our last day, we found that you can buy a day bus pass for 6 euros from most newsagents. This would have been handy to know beforehand! We visited the Guiness Storehouse (tickets were included as part of our deal) which was good fun. I'd also recommend having a drink or lunch in The Bank on College Green, and we also had dinner in Sabor Brazil which I can't recommend enough! 

Don't be put off by the fact the hotel is a little way out of the city centre, it is easy to get around, you won't be disappointed and you really will be looked after!",5,2011,05,04
211,Great rooms and very friendly staff. Just wish it was nearer to town!,"Just stayed here for 3 nights end of April. I booked the hotel through a 3rd party and got a very good deal. Unfortunately, our first room was located right next to a linen cupboard so the noise of doors slamming was a little grinding, especially as we were not feeling tip-top from illness. BUT after speaking to the very friendly staff and manager, we were moved to a very nice room on the 4th floor. I was really impressed with how they dealt with this. They were genuinely apologetic. 

The food was ok. The hotel was very busy so we opted for breakfast in bed - definitely worth the 5 euros. Again, the room service staff were very friendly. 

It takes around 15-20 minutes to walk into town - taxi costs around 10 euro. Buses stop 5 minutes up the road. It wasn't really an issue but we would stay in town next time for ease. We were really taken with Dublin. Very friendly people, great atmosphere.",5,2011,05,03
211,Brilliant Hotel,"Booked as a 2 night weekend package with Travel Zoo. Got a free uprated room, B and B, plus 1 evening meal, plus free entry to Guinness Store
Main reason of stay was to see Peter Kaye at the Dublin O2 (he was fantastic by the way - go and see him!). Hotel booked us transfers to and from the O2 for 7 Euros each return
Room was lovely and quiet and we had the turndown service, bathrobes, slippers etc
The free evening meal was really good, even the wine and drinks were not as expensive as I thought that they would be.
Breakfast was full English (or Irish depending on your point of view) and service was impeccable. TIP avoid peak time between 0930 and 1000hrs or you will have to wait for a table
The staff are fantastic and nothing is too much trouble. We arrived at 10am and although we couldn't check in they looked after our bags while we went into Dublin
Check out when we were there was 11am so no rush to check out
Hotel is opposite Croake Park Stadium so it does get busy outside when there is a match on and the road outside will be closed for the duration of the match. There was one when we was there but it didnt upset us and the fans that came into the hotel bar were good natured and friendly. There are door staff on hand to manage just who comes into the hotel during and after the match. Beware that like most hotels now they show football, football, football in the bars
Slight downside of the hotel is its location as it is a good 15mins walk into town through the not so best parts of Dublin. TIP - use the hotel shuttle bus to take you into O'Connell Street. This is part of the Dublin City 'hop on - hop off' tour. The hotel staff will arrange it for you. Other slight downside is that coming from the airport the bus (we used the aircoach) will drop you off at Drumcondra at the end of Cloncliffe Road which is a good 5 mins walk to the hotel",5,2011,05,03
211,"OK, but still far from city",Stayed in hotel in April for 2 nights. Clean business hotel. But far from city centre (E10-15 taxi ride) and everything else. Walked a couple of times - about 20 min. No good restaurants nearby.,3,2011,05,02
211,"Faultless, brilliant stay","My partner and I stayed here as part of a package deal, which made the cost of the stay including b'fast very reasonable - this was just an added bonus

Had we paid the full amount, I would have been very happy anyway - everything from start to finish was fantastic:
The staff were very helpful, courteous and informative. fantastic service..
The room was very clean and we were happy to relax in it (included sjky sports on the tv), the bathroom was great, and we got a couple of great nights sleep too
The breakfast was great, and we had lunch in the restaurant on the last day, which again was great
The location was easy to get to/from the airport - the 16A or 41 bus goes directly between the airport and a few minutes walk from the hotel for less than 2 euro pp. it is about a 15-20min walk in to town - this is the only drawback i can think of, but as the weather was nice when we were there we were happy enough to walk - if its poor weather you will need to grab a taxi, or the hop on/off city tour bus which stops outside the hotel.

i think that covers everything, i would recommend this hotel to anyone visiting Dublin",5,2011,05,02
211,Great hotel but a bit far out,"The hotel was very nice. Food excellent , staff extremely helpful although sometimes you had to wait at the bar due to lack of staff on duty, mainly during the day.
The hotel is within walking distance of the centre but some of the areas you have to walk through leave a lot to be desired. 
If you are not bothered about walking its €10 taxi ride into town.
But everything is expensive in Dublin so take plenty of money with you!
To sum up a fantastic hotel but the location let's it down.",5,2011,05,01
211,Impeccable Service!,"I was lucky to get a good deal on this hotel via Travelzoo (70 euro per night, incl breakfast). Everything about the hotel was amazing. Every afternoon I would come back to a cleaned room and every evening the turn down bed service will have left me in heaven with the bathrobes, slippers and lovely caramel chocolates. The bar was quite busy as there were matches happening all weekend at the stadium across the street so I didn't spend a lot of time there. The executive lounge on the 4th floor was brilliant! There were snacks and beverages (coffee, tea, juice, bottled water) available whenever you wanted. The breakfast was delicious and more than just a meal. I paid the extra few euro to treat myself to room service and it was just as full and plenty as the buffet downstairs! I would HIGHLY recommend this hotel to anyone visiting Dublin. While it is a solid 15-20 minute walk from the city centre, you're able to catch the tour bus into town in the mornings and then come back with them in the afternoons. I did the dublinsightseeing.ie tours on the green bus and had a FANTASTIC time! I found the 'live commentary' to be the best option. The ticket was decently priced and available at the hotel, I was able to use it for 2 days!",5,2011,05,01
211,Avoid on match days,"We arrived on Friday morning all ok, Saturday all ok, Sunday awful!
Avoid when there is a game at the huge stadium right across the road. 
Taxis can not get near the hotel as the police close the roads off, the hotel is full of fans in the bar and on the terrace area, football playing on the tv in the bar. 
I can't believe all the blokes that are In the bar are staying at the hotel! It would seem it's convenient drinking hole before the game.
2 security guards stop fans coming in the front door and direct them round to the terrace entrance.       
Kids running around the foyer area, really poor and as a guest at the hotel you are not able to order a hot drink from the bar as your told to go out to the food cart?? What ever that is?
Went to use the toilet in the foyer and it was full of fans swearing etc

Nice!!",3,2011,05,01
211,Excellent!,"Managed to get a very good last minute deal on this hotel. Id wanted to try it for ages based on the reviews here.
It did not let me down. 
Very nice hotel. Great value for money. I would suggest getting the breakfast inclusive rate and it as good a breakfast as I've had anywhere.
Staff were fantastic too.",4,2011,04,30
211,"Excellent hotel with excellent food,service and rooms","Very impressed with the hotel - good size spotless rooms (we had a deluxe) and had a few really nice touches i.e. the chocolates, turn down night service, bath robes and slippers.  Ate breakfast, a lunch and an evening meal in the hotel and found that all were tasty and very good quality.  My only negative (for some) would be that it is approx 15 minute walk from the city centre - however this wasn't  problem to us as the weather was so good!",5,2011,04,29
211,Close enough to the city!,"This was our first stop in our cross country tour of Ireland.  We got to the hotel from the airport around 9 am and were told that our rooms wouldn't be ready until around noon at least.  They were able to check our bags.  We decided to go to the city, although we couldn't get directions on how to walk there from anyone that worked there.  After walking around for 4 hours, an overnight flight, and being awake for over 24 hours straight, we were all exhausted to say the least.  We got back to the hotel around 12:30 and asked for our 2 booked rooms.  One room was ready, so the 4 of us decided to go to that room and take a nap.  We requested that we be called when the 2nd room was available.  We were never called, I had to go down to the front desk and ask them.
Overall, it was an average hotel.  Close enough to the city, although I do not recommend walking there at night, because you do have to walk through some seedy areas.  The breakfast was fantastic... everyone was satisfied.  I probably would not stay here if I visit Dublin again... The B & B's were MUCH better.",3,2011,04,29
211,Can handle a rush,Our tour came to Croke Park in the Middle of the Dublin Vs Cork football game accross the street. Yet no delays or problems checking in! Good staff. Breakfast was good and the room was good and clean - although my fan in the ventilation did not go high enough to drown out the usual hallway noises.,4,2011,04,29
211,Excellent Service and Rooms,The entire staff was very friendly. The rooms were spacious and had excellent bathrooms. They also offered services like the ability to purchase the Hop on Hop off tour tickets for less than you could purchase them online. Within walking distance to downtown Dublin. The Concierge was very knowledgeable. Both times we stayed there our rooms were ready for check in well before the official time. Very nice and decently stocked bar was located near the lobby,5,2011,04,27
211,Easy to Walk & Bus to City Center,"Great clean, friendly hotel with a great Irish Breakfast and buffet. This hotel was pre-selected by Septure Tours. Having a proper hotel was great for the first day when we needed to catch up on some sleep.  The hotel staff kindly upgraded us to a large 2 bed room. We could not pick up wireless service in our room, we went to the lobby to get a signal. My friend and I walked to the city center in about 20 mins or took a short bus ride (£1.80). Bus services ends before midnight so expect roughly a £15 taxi ride.",4,2011,04,26
211,"Excellent,clean, very pleasant staff,great value","Stayed at the Hotel for a weekend, found the Hotel a pleasant experience, the food was very good and plentiful. The staff from the reception to the bar staff and waiters were exceptional,the breakfast was valve for money. The bedroom was very clean and the bed was the most comfortable bed i have every slept in. Definitely would go back, if you get the opportunity to go you wont be disappointed i promise you.",4,2011,04,25
211,"Comfortable, lovely hotel a bit far from sight-seeing destinations.","Booked with a package to Adare Manor villas, we stayed at the beginning and end of our trip to Ireland. The hotel is lovely with comfortable rooms and beds, very nice bathrooms, and without question the best hotel breakfast we've ever had. The free breakfast was included with our package for each night's stay. The staff is very accommodating and helpful. In all an excellent place to stay. That said, it was a taxi ride to get to ANY sights. Taxis are easy to get and can get you downtown where you can walk almost anywhere to tourist sights. We managed to see what we desired but would probably choose another hotel closer to downtown next time.",5,2011,04,24
211,Very nice hotel- Far from sightseeing destinations,"This hotel was booked as part of a package deal for our first night in Dublin.  The hotel was very nice with modern finishes.  Staff was not overly helpful, but not rude either.  We asked for suggestions on restaurants nearby, but they did not have many.  We came to find out that this is probably because there really isn't much to speak of for sit down restaurants around.  The bed was super comfy and the room was well decorated.  The breakfast was delicious and very hearty.  Seems like a hotel more for business travelers than tourists, but still a very nice hotel.",4,2011,04,23
211,"Excellent choice for a clean, inexpensive stay in Dublin","Don't let the rundown section of the part of town where this hotel is located fool you. It's just on the outskirts of Dublin but a few short blocks from all the action. It looks a little scary but it's a safe walk. This is a great value for a city hotel. It was quiet and the staff was wonderful, especially the concierge. The Bistro is a little pricey, so go out for meals. Take advantage of the hop-on, hop-off bus which picks you up right out in front of the hotel, it's a great deal.",5,2011,04,21
211,Not a bad option for a low cost stay,"Stayed here for one night at the end of March. The main good points:
* Great value for money for Dubin
* The hotel itself was very clean and the staff very professional
* The rooms were modern with decent facilities.

The bad points:
* A 30 minute queue for breakfast when the hotel didn't seem that busy was quite frustrating especially as the buffet was only average (taste and heat)
* Although professional, the staff didn't seem to have any of the Dubin charisma or charm seen elsewhere in the city. They were efficient but lacked the friendliness that Dubiners renowned for
* The location is about 20 min walk to the middle of O'Connell St which is fine in the day and when it is dry but a little dodgy late at night given the surrounding area - a shuttle bus service to the centre would be a useful addition
* The 1 single and 1 slightly larger that single bed in each room is a little strange when the reservation stated 1 Queen/King bed.

Overall, if you're looking for a nice cheap hotel a little out of the city then you could do worse that the Croke Park. If you want to be close to the action and want the true Dublin experience fork out a little more and stay closer to the centre. 3.5 star.",3,2011,04,20
211,Fantastic value in a lovely hotel,"We stayed for two night as part of a travel zoo deal which was unbelieveable value. The hotel is smart and clean. Staff are good and the concierge was very helpful. The only downside as some of the other reviews state is that is is a good walk from town but this didn't bother us as we went out and stayed out. We walked into town twice and and back once, the second night we got a cab which was 10E. I can see what people say about the area you walk thro but we felt perfectly safe.",4,2011,04,18
211,"Nice hotel, pleasant staff, rooms and location just ok","We stayed at Croke Park as part of our Aer Lingus Vacation. It is located about a 15 minute walk outside of City Centre. The neighborhood looked gritty but we didn't feel unsafe walking during the day. At night we chose to take a taxi, which was reasonably priced. The rooms are just ok. We had 2 beds in our room, a full sized and a single. There was just the two of us and we are used to sleeping in a larger bed so it was a bit uncomfortable. The breakfast was a buffet and it was plentiful and quite good. We were scheduled to stay at Croke Park again the last night of our vacation, but when we arrived to check in, we were told they were overbooked. They offered us a room at thye Gibson Hotel, which we were told was located in City Centre. We arrived at the Gibson to find that it was in the middle of nowhere, at least a 20 minute walk from City Centre. Since it was our last night we decided to make the best of it. When we returned to Croke Park the next day to retrieve our car, we told the manager that we felt we were given false information about the location of the Gibson Hotel. The manager was very apologetic and offered to make it right. We agreed to drinks and lunch on the house. So, if you decide to stay here and get bumped, make sure you know the exact location of the hotel they are sending you to.",3,2011,04,16
211,We were pleasantly surprised by the friendliness of this big hotel.,"We felt the hotel was conveniently located for our needs. The desk staff were very helpful
with directions and answered all out questions. Concierge was a fun guy who provided
loads of information and service. The restaurant offered a large variety of fresh and tasty
meals, snacks and drinks. Our room was beautifully appointed with plenty of light. when we needed it. Internet was available in our room and also computers were available in the lobby. Our bed was comfortable; the linens were plush as were the fabrics throughout.
There was a gym and complimentary use of bicycles.  Everybody was friendly and professional. We really enjoyed our stay at The Croke Park Hotel.",5,2011,04,13
211,"Nice hotel, location just so-so","We recently stayed at the Croke Park Hotel in Dublin. The hotel itself is very modern and new. The staff were always very helpful and pleasant, from the cleaning staff to the bartender to the people at the front desk. 

For Europe standards, the rooms were decently large and the bathrooms were very nicely designed. 

The only drawback really was the location. It is perfect if you are going to a game at Croke Park Stadium, but I would have preferred to have stayed closer to the city center in Dublin. The area around the hotel is not an overly touristy section, so we felt a little out of place walking toward the city center with our maps in hand. There is a hop-on, hop-off bus that stops there every day at 10:00 am. I would actually suggest that the hotel consider running a regular service into Dublin..perhaps a few times a day to give guests that option and save on taxi fare or walking through very unfamiliar streets.

There seemed to be many tour groups staying there and I think that likely works well for them, since they have a bus to take them from place to place. All and all, it was a nice hotel, pleasant staff, just not the ideal location. For me the two positives about the location were that we could park our car under the hotel in a garage (since there is room for that) and it wasn't too far from the airport.",4,2011,04,12
211,Friendliest Large Hotel Ever Stayed At,"This hotel provided the best customer service I've ever stayed at.  The personalized service of all hotel staff, especially the front desk was outstanding.  They always made time, despite their often hectic schedule, to answer questions for all clients and were adept at giving advice to tourists on just about everything.  If they didn't know, they took the time to find out.  Although the hotel itself is located a good walk from downtown, the service and the hotel conveniences that were provided were well worth the hike.  Of all the hotels I've ever stayed at, this was my best hotel experience.  Excellence at its best.",5,2011,04,12
211,The is an excellent hotel with first class service,"This is an excellent hotel; the staff we encountered were both helpful and friendly, 
We arrived at 8pm and used the restaurant which was of high quality, attentive and reasonably priced compared with the other meals we had in the City centre on the following two evenings. Breakfast was informal but again with good service.
Previous comments about the hotels location were helpful; we walked into Dublin City centre and returned by Taxi (9 to 10 euro’s depending which part of Dublin we were in)
We would recommend this hotel unreservedly; Do not  let its location put you off if you are visiting Dublin for pleasure.",5,2011,04,11
211,Good location if you want to see a match at the stadium.,"The hotel staff was very nice. You need to keep your room card handy in order to use the lights in the room as well as the elevator. Unfortunately, it is not close to city center, however, if you are looking to see a match, it is directly across from the stadium. Rooms are clean and breakfast was good.",3,2011,04,10
211,"Great hotel, really comfortable beds","Got a really good deal through Travel Zoo.  Rooms were lovely, food was excellent and staff were really helpful.   It was a little futher outside of Dublin City Centre but lovely and quiet rooms.  20 minute walk to town",5,2011,04,08
211,Clean and comfortable - great service,"We just finished our stay last night at the Croke Park Hotel. It was part of our Aer Lingus Vacations/Sceptre tours holiday package which included a rental car. We arrived at 5:15am from NYC so decided to take the airport bus (12 euros return trip each)  to the stop off which is a few blocks from the hotel mostly because others TA reviewers told of not needing a car in Dublin. That being said, the Croke Park Hotel is 15 minutes walk from Dublin center city and offers free parking so in hindsight we should have just picked up the rental car from Dan Dooley right away (well, they only open at 6am) and driven to the hotel, parked our car and walked into town on foot thereafter (it is a bit desolate at night so i wouldn't do the walk alone; but fine during the day). You don't need a car in Dublin itself. The staff were all very professional and friendly. The hotel, restaurant, rooms and gym are all very clean and new. I believe the hotel is only a few years old. The included breakfast was very tasty with a large selection (hot eggs, sausages, bacon, beans; cold cereals; lots of fruit, cheeses and meats; nice pastries; 4 types of juice, and coffee and teas). There are also two free computer terminals in the lobby with a free printer, and free WIFI in the lobby only or in the upgraded suites (but not in the standard suites). You can get a US computer converter from the concierge for a 10 euro deposit, refunded upon return of the converter. One other piece of advice for picky travellers is that if you arrive on an early morning flight, check-in at the hotel is not until 2pm. Of course, they will offer you a room if they have one but no guarantees, and it can be tiring snoozing on a lobby couch until a room is ready!!",5,2011,04,07
211,"Great hotel...north of city center, close enough to airport, everything","Nice hotel, clean rooms/bath...hotel was hopping when we where there....cab ride to/from city centre was 12.50 euro...did walk 15 mins to city centre w/ 15 yr old and husband at 5pm, not sure you would do it at night....take cab instead....as others say, neighborhood looked sketchy, but we had no problem during the day....close to airport - cab ride was 25 euro (incl tip)....great hotel, very accommodating., ok bar at night, teen liked on demand movies in room....hotel is directly across street from stadium...i hear they close street down when there is match....fyi....",4,2011,04,06
211,Lovely hotel stay,"Firstly, I'm really not a fan of hotels. I much prefer B&B's where you get more personalised service. We stayed at Croke Park though because we got a brilliant package through Travelzoo. It included an upgrade to a deluxe room and breakfast each day for 70 euro a night. Check in was a little cold, and they had our room wrong. The receptionist asked 'So, you've booked a king size bed'. I was with my Mum, so I thought this question a little silly. When I clarified this, the receptionist commented 'well, whoever booked it booked a king size bed.' When I double checked my booking though (because I have been known to make mistakes) it did clearly state two double beds. The rooms themselves were GORGEOUS and the facilities were great (gym, guest computers). The wait staff at dinner were brilliant, though the ones at breakfast were a bit grumpy (can't blame them though!). The hotel is a fair hike from the city, so I'd only stay here if you like a walk or are willing to pay for a cab.",4,2011,04,04
211,Excetional Hotel,"Took my wife to Dublin for her 59th birthday - a two night midweek stay booked via travelzoo. Absolutely perfect hotel spotlessly clean.
Our package included upgrade to Exec room (4th floor) dinner on one night and included a trip for two to the Guinness Store.
We have previously stayed on O'Connell street in the city centre but the hotel is only 15mins walk away - no problem. Food was first class - we even ate there both nights and all the staff were charming and helpfull.
Would highly recommend this hotel.",5,2011,04,04
211,The ultimate hotel in Dublin,"We used this hotel as part of a package deal with Aer Lingus on St. Patrick's Day this year. Wonderful hotel, great food, quiet room on a very busy night. Free parking under the hotel made this the ultimate hotel in Dublin. Easy to walk to main area of town. We'd stay no where else in Dublin! Free internet in the lobby, what more can I say!!",5,2011,04,03
211,Smoke City,"Ireland is a lovely country and the Croke Park Hotel is wonderful but---------it is really away from most attractions south of the river Liffey...necessitating long walks or $taxi rides.  So many people here smoke...they have simply taken smoking out of bars and restaurants and permeated the air outside with second-hand smoke.  I have been all over Europe and Dublin takes the carcinogen award.  The people seem oblivious to the effects of smoking.  It can really spoil one's vacation if one is a non-smoker. 
  Food here is expensive and just average.",4,2011,04,03
211,Best ever,"This is our second stay in this hotel in 5 months and overall our experience this time was even better than last.

Initially we were slightly disappointed as we were allocated a room on the 2nd floor rather than the executive rooms we had stayed in previously on the 4th floor. There was no WiFi although we did have wired internet. We also had access to the executive lounge on the 4th floor which we really love. Here yo have WiFi access as well as access to free tea coffee and juices as well as fresh fruit throughout the day.

 So we soon got over our initial disappointment. Our stay included one evening meal and a stadium tour of Croke Park. The menu we were offered was limited, however they were happy to change the mains for my wife without any fuss. 

The food in the hotel is excellent and compares favorably to that which we enjoyed on our 2 Royal Caribbean cruises last year. Breakfast was even better with a huge choice of continental style breakfast as well as flavorsome fried breakfast items.

However what really sets this hotel apart is the wonderful friendly and helpful staff. Staff don't seem to just have their own station like you find in most hotels. These staff work part of an amazing team and seem to be aware of customers needs. Within a few minutes of being seated on the first morning four different member of staff had asked if we would like tea coffee or toast. Throughout our breakfast they regularly checked if we needed any refills. 

Buffet style breakfast has great selection but when i asked for a poached egg I was assured this was not a problem and that it would be brought to me. The member of staff searched the restaurant to find me as soon as it was ready. They even smiled and accommodated my 8 year old sons request for a runny egg.

The Croke Park stadium tour included was also fabulous. I hope to be back soon.",5,2011,04,03
211,great **** hotel,"Couldn't fault the hotel itself lovely clean rooms comfy beds tv, cd/radio take cd's if you like your own music, hairdryer and a mini bar opposite is the croke park stadium. The walk into dublin city is around 15/20minutes we went straight up t he hill and across the traffic lights past some fantastic old house's the area is alittle rough but after about 10 min walk you reach a nicer area.       
Bad points for us as we were 2 ladies travelling alone were the prices of the taxi's 24 euro from airport to the hotel and between 8 euro and 11 euro into dublin and then the same back! also food and drink we found was expensive 16 euro for vodka and a bacardi and coke and a meal in the hotel in the evening being around  30 euro for 2 meals.
lucky for us we brought a bottle of vodka and bacardi at the airport duty free which we drank in our room otherwise we would have been up the greek without a paddle shall we say!! overall a had a great trip we went on a few trips during our stay malahide castle wicklow tour and a evening with irish music and a 3 course meal all worth a try.",5,2011,03,29
211,Fantastic Hotel,"This hotel is one of the best we have ever stayed in, all the staff were helpful, you were made to feel special, from the minute we walked through the door.
The room was clean  a credit to the housekeeping staff.
Food was fantastic we ate in the restaurant the two nights we were there,try the cheese cake its divine.The breakfast was  first class.
All amenities were very good, perhaps some people might not like the location too much, about a 15 minute walk to O'Connell St, but everything about this hotel makes up for the location. congratulations to all the staff you all deserve a pat on the back.
If we go back to Dublin we would stay at the Croke Park Hotel again.",5,2011,03,28
211,"Awesome breakfast, great bathrooms, service mainly excellent, no personality","I travelled with my partner to Dublin for a long weekend. 

Our initial arrival wasn't brilliant as we were met by a rather grumpy lady on reception. However, this was definitely an exception and every other member of staff that we met for the rest of the stay was wonderfully friendly and helpful, giving us very clear directions, organising a cab for us early on our last morning and generally being excellent.

We stayed in a superior room on the fourth floor with access to the executive lounge. The breakfast there is excellent. It is buffet style with a good range of options from cereal to smoked salmon. Other options included pastries and croissants, although these had sometimes run out later run. Nespresso machines were a nice touch and there was a great selection of teas, orange juice, milk etc. The wireless could also be accessed from our room, although that may not be true for all rooms on the floor.

The room was fine. Comfy bed, very quiet and an amazing bathroom (separate shower and bath, for example). The actual bedroom was very much like any other hotel room anywhere else in the world, and the carpet was rather ugly. However, aesthetics aside, it was very clean, comfortable and had everything you could possibly want (dressing gowns, slippers, tea, satellite TV, wired and wireless internet, etc). 

The location is amazing for Croke Park and fine for central Dublin. The walk to central Dublin is only about 15 minutes and goes through a perfectly pleasant area.",5,2011,03,28
211,Superb hotel with very friendly and helpful staff,"My wife and I stayed here for 3 nights  in March and enjoyed every minute of our trip. Nothing was too much trouble for the staff,and every request was attended to straight away. The service and food were excellent,the room clean and tidy and only  a short walk to the city centre made it an excellent location.  We would certainly stay here again and would have no hesitation to recommend it to other people.",5,2011,03,27
211,Up to Snuff,"This place is more like a very good hotel in North America than one in Europe but the attitude and helpfulness of the staff are on a par with the best I've experienced in high-end hotels in Europe or Asia. When our daughter realized after checkout that she had left behind a ring she called at day's end from our next locale. They already had it secured and were prepared to mail back to the U.S. Since we had to return to Dublin's airport days later we stopped and picked it up. The concierge also gave us quick, concise directions to our rental car return.

It's a fair walk from the hotel to the sights in town but since we're walkers it was no problem. After each long day we took a cab back-not too expensive an indulgence. The down side? There are few places to dine in the area after dark so you either eat there, accept one of the few immediate choices or drive/taxi back into the city.",5,2011,03,27
211,Fabulous!!!,"This hotel is amazing, from walking through the door to getting to the room all i could think was wow! Service brilliant and so friendly! When i return to Dublin this will be the hotel i return to! Ate in the bistro on the first night food was devine! The breakfast so much choice! The room we had was huge and the drssing gowns, turned down service and executive lounge was a pleasant added bonus! Will be definately looking out for more bargains like this!",5,2011,03,27
211,Absolutely Fantastic,"My spouse & I  visited Dublin for March Break/St. Paddy's Day Festivities & decided to stay at the Croke Park Hotel....What a GREAT choice.  The Hotel itself is just beautiful & very modern.  The rooms(we stayed on the executive floor -4) were amazing & it was only an extra $30 euro per night for the upgrade which offered us a larger room with turn down service nightly, an executive lounge area with continental breakfast, refreshments all day, daily newspapers & large screen tv... also included was a beverage from the sideline bar each night of our stay for each of us... & could also be delivered to our room!  The upgrade also included free tickets to the Guiness Storehouse, & that is a major tourist attraction, which we planned to pay to go to anyways!  Well worth the upgrade.  The Staff & I mean ALL of the staff were superb!  From the waiters, bartenders, housekeeping, conceirge & the front desk staff!.  In particular, Tara on the front desk made our trip more than enjoyable by offering suggestions to the ""must see"" places, the best way to get their, safety , etc...  I would return for another trip & would highly recommend any of my family, friends, etc to stay here if travelling to Dublin!!",5,2011,03,24
211,Great Location for O2 and town,"Excellent hotel, staff very helpful and friendly. Hotel was lovely we had our breakfast included in our late check out deal. Buffet style breakfast. Great selection of hot and cold foods. Room was great, double bed and single bed. Good range of toiletries supplied in bathroom, hair-dryer iron and ironing board supplied. Stayed with my teenage daughter for 1 night as we were attending a concert at the O2 Arena. Location was great its on the North side of Dublin. The hotel has its own free car park which is hard to find in Dublin, most hotels charge for parking. Location is great, its 10 mins walk to O'Connell street or if you would rather get the bus there is a stop very close. If you are attending a concert at the O2, its ideal, as there is a mini- bus which you can order from reception to collect you. (16 euros return). It will collect you at 18:30 and take you to the concert, also picks you up without any hassle of trying to get your car out of the O2 Arena car park.  I have got to say this was great I had already paid for the car park at the O2 but decided to use this instead. We were out of the concert straight on the bus and waited about 5 mins for the other guests to arrive and back at the hotel in about 10 mins.",4,2011,03,23
211,Croke Park was amazing,"Me, my partner and two friend girls booked the Sceptre 3-City Tour. We stayed at the Croke Park Hotel and it was AMAZING, the service, rooms and breakfast were great. It's right up the street from Dublin Downtown area and the walk was safe and fun. The staff was fascinating and very friendly.",5,2011,03,22
211,This is THE hotel to stay in when in Dublin,"Just returned from yet another stay in The Croke Park and it was as great as previous visits. A warm welcome at reception by staff who you remember from past visits and all staff throughout the hotel are very polite and helpful. Our room on executive floor was superb and when we returned to the hotel in the evening our bed had been turned down,chocs on the pillow,lavender hottie in bed and dressing gowns and slippers waiting  for us. . . . what a lovely sursprise.

We had lunch and dinner in the bar and it was georgous. . . . great service and the food was lovely and not expensive. Breakfast was great. . . loads to choose from.

I can not speak highly enough of this hotel and I would not think of staying anywhere else when I go to dublin.

Congratulations to mangement and staff for such a superbly run hotel.

I look forward to my next visit.",5,2011,03,22
211,We would definitely stay again,"Having read other TA reviews we feel they are fully justified and this is a well run Hotel.
eg, when trying to watch the TV-Football the reception quality in our room was very bad and so we called the front desk, a few minutes later it was fixed but also we were offered to see the game on the bigger screen in the Club Rooms Lounge as an apology for the problem.So great service.
The rooms are very comfortable  indeed and we tried the restaurant on the first night as were were a little tired and thought the food was really very good. and so we decided to eat there again on the second night as well. The Hotel is only about ten minutes from down town. The only question might be how good will the hotel be when the place is crawling with sports fans from the nearby stadium.
But full marks to the management",5,2011,03,18
211,The best hotel in Dublin!,This is the best hotel in Dublin unless you insist on having a pool to complete your hotel experience. Staff are the best I've ever encountered and the food is the best hotel food I've ever eaten. Rooms are excellent and it's only a 15 minute stroll to the city centre.,5,2011,03,17
211,as good as it gets,"fantastic hotel .booked through travelzoo, such good value for money. i am a single parent with my two youngest children at university, so i really did appreciate what a fantastic offer i got..breakfast was as good as veryone said. we had a meal in reastraunt on our 2nd night, and i cant describe just how good it was... From start to finnish our stay was so enjoyable, i cant think of any thing negative to say about the hotel.",5,2011,03,16
211,Outstanding hotel,"Since August 2010 I am staying in this hotel for 3 nights a week. 
* The service is excellent.
* Very friendly people working over here. 
* Rooms are good and complete (free internet)
* Bar and restaurant are good (great people working overthere)
* Value for money is excellent
* Free shuttle bus to East Point business park
* Close to city center

In short: This is the place to stay when you are in Dublin.",5,2011,03,15
211,"Overall, a positive experience and good value for money.","First impressions were a bit disappointing, due to the (in my opinion) run down part of town in which the hotel was situated. Also decor in entrance a bit tired. However, the rooms were very comfortable and quiet (though smaller than i expected); with a lovely bathroom and mini bar! The staff were all very friendly and helpful. Our stay was for my husbands 40th birthday and they left a card and little banner for him and 2 little bottles of sparkling wine, which was a lovely touch. They also said they had upgraded us. We didn't eat there but had early evening drinks in the bar, which was lovely and the food looked fantastic and very popular. The hotel is fairly convenient with a 15 min walk into town which is fine if not raining which it did for the whole 2 days we were there! We didn't get the advertised hot water bottle and turn down service or the hot towels on arrival, but were not bothered about these!",4,2011,03,14
211,"Friendly staff, clean rooms and excellent service!  10/10","Great service, friendly staff! Hot Towel on arrival to warm up those cold hands! Room was clean and fresh with a great ambience to it! Very compfy and luxurious. To finish it off, a great breakfast in bed experience which was delicious!",5,2011,03,13
211,As good as they say,"My wife and I stayed for a week in March 2011. Greeted with hot facecloths after secure parking in hotel basement. Quickly into spacious room with two double beds and a washroom with full-size bath and separate shower. Spotlessly clean and snappy service. Staff could not have been more helpful. Breakfast included and food generally was of a very high standard and lots of it. Widescreen TVs in rooms with Sky Sports. Only drawback was the location, a 20-minute walk from the city centre and in a rather rough area (typical of most of Dublin north of the river, unfortunately). But don't let that put you off. This hotel is one of the very best, and heartily recommended.",5,2011,03,11
211,Home Away from Home,"I traveled to Dublin from the US and arrived at the hotel at 6:30 a.m., expecting to drop off my bags and wander the streets until checkin time.  Much to my surprise my room was available immediately and I was able to unpack and take a nap before setting out to the city.  The staff at the hotel (front desk, concierge, restaurant and bar) were as friendly and helpful as possible, the rooms were scrupulously clean and the hotel was a great home base.  The only disadvantage is the location, which is north of the river and a 15-minute walk from the city center.  Other travelers have commented that the neighborhood is ""sketchy"".  I didn't find it particularly threatening, and walked home after dark with no problem.  I probably spent more money on cab fare than I ordinarily would have done, but staying at this hotel was worth it.",5,2011,03,10
211,One of the best hotels I have stayed in,"Stayed in the Croke Park Hotel for the weekend 4-6th March on a Travelzoo deal.
Hve been to Dublin a number of times and this is the best hotel we have stayed in.
The staff were excellent. They really seemed to want to ensure that the guests enjoyed their stay. Nothing was too much trouble for them. We stayed in a deluxe room which
was far better than some of the 5 star hotels we have stayed in. The food both at breakfast time and at dinner was very good, especially considering the hotel was full the weekend we stayed. The Bistro was well staffed and the service excellent. The head chef was always about the dining room checking that the buffet breakfast was well stocked and that the quality was of a good standard. I would definitely stay here again and recommend it to my friends.",5,2011,03,10
211,Just as good as previously reviewed,"Very impressed with this hotel.  I have stayed south of the Liffey on two occasions and the Croke Park blew those locations away.  The facilities are very well appointed.  The rooms were nice, the bar and restaurant were great and the service was impeccable.  I must give a special thanks to the night manager Aileen.  She put up with my groups' questions on several late nights as we were drunkenly trying to plan our next days activities!  She could not have been nicer or more helpful.  The only downside is really the location.  It did not particularly bother us as we were four men travelling but I would hesitate to walk to the city centre with my family.  One route was pretty rough.  The cab ride was short, though.  It was also very quick to the airport.  Overall a really nice experience!",5,2011,03,09
211,Fantastic Stay,"I was so impressed with this hotel. We arrived at the hotel at approx 7:30am to be greeted by hot faceclothes at check in. Immeditately given the key to our room where we immediately fell into a deep slumber for a few hours. It was so spacious, spotless and comfortable. Beautiful shower and separate bathtub. Free onsite parking. After a day touring around Dublin, we arrived back later that night to a type written note informing me that hotel security had noticed I had not closed the door to my car properly, so they closed it and advised me to be sure to check it to make sure it was locked properly. Nothing was taken from the car. Breakfast was delicious and directions of how to drive thru the city and out to the motor way to Kilkenny were excellent. I can't say enough about this hotel and I have travelled all over the world. It deserves all the praise it gets. Kudos to the staff for their hard work.",5,2011,03,08
211,4 out of 4 - Yet Another Fabulous Stay at The Croke Park Dublin,"We stayed at the Croke Park Hotel for the fourth time recently and wanted to express our grateful satisfaction on a most memorable stay.  The Hotel offers excellence as standard - having chosen to stay there on four occasions we feel qualified to say this -and this time was again no exception.  We arrived there tired and exhausted as we had planned to stay at a Hotel in the West of Ireland (we decided to leave after one day and night as it made Fawlty Towers look normal!) and made the journey across Country to stay at the Croke Park.  There are so many wonderful attributes offered by this Hotel but if we had to make a choice it would be in favour of Customer Service.  The staff really cannot be helpful enough and display teamwork at it's best throughout the Hotel.   Sean and the Team do their utmost to ensure a happy and pleasant stay and to their credit succeed on every visit.  The rooms are spotless, well equipped and spacious, food excellent  (my favourite meal is Breakfast) ie Tea/Coffee/Toast/ with Full Irish or Continental Breakfast - all delicious and served in abundance with waiting staff constantly doing the rounds to ensure top ups of Tea/Coffee/Toast are readily available on request.  I would particularly recommend a Deluxe Room stay as experienced by ourselves on this occasion - Fluffy Robes, comfortable Slippers, turn down Bed service with Hottie and Sweets plus access to the Executive Lounge where complimentary Food and Drinks are available.  On a final note, we'd again like to thank Sean Reid whose attitude exemplifies hospitality and Professionalism at all times.",5,2011,03,08
211,Perfect hotel in friendly Dublin,"So enjoyed our stay.  The hospitality given by the restaurant staff was exceptional.  Every member of staff that we met or bumped into were so friendly and welcoming.,  Loved our bedrrom, really comfortable and the wide screen television was not ""so in your face"" as most hotels, but at an angle to one side of our double bed - much better!  Much prefer having a separate shower (and a bath).  Ate in the restaurant each evening.  Really good food and so much flavour in their fillet steak!  Wonderful breakfasts..
Took the bus 13/13A or 16/16A into Dublin centre - 1.20 Euros.  There is so much walking around Dublin, we did not want to be tired before we got to the city centre.  Also used the Hop on - hop off bus, a must to orientate yourself., and you can buy the tickets from the best of concieges at the hotel.   Besides the frequent hop on buses from O'Connell Street there is a service from the hotel at 10 am. 
DON'T MISS visiting Kilmainham Gaol for so many reasons!!! 
 Living in the outskirts of London we were so heartened by the friendliness of everyone in Dublin.",5,2011,03,06
211,Highly recommend this great value hotel,"When I paid 79 euros for a Dublin hotel I was worried about the quality. How wrong could I be this is one of the best quality hotels I have stayed in in Dublin. From the hot towels on arrival, to the quality and the comfort of the room, to the bottle of mineral water on departure. The breakfast was great, good quality juce, fresh fruit, perfect eggs and bacon. All staff friendly and helpful. Free parking right accross from Croke Park. Not the most central hotel in Dublin but if you don't need to be in the centre the best value you can get.",5,2011,03,03
211,Lovely hotel - will definitely be back,"We stayed for 2 nights in this hotel recently. I think we were upgraded to a deluxe room although nothing was said when we checked in. We were on the 4th floor with access to the Executive lounge which is a really nice touch. The room was spotless and we were at the end of the corridor so it was very, very quiet. The best sound proofing I have come across in a hotel. We heard nothing at all from next door or outside. Breakfast downstairs was great, lots of choice. Staff were extremely helpful, friendly and pleasant. We went down at a later time for breakfast. There was a bit of a queue.  The staff never rushed us. We were there for a match in Croke Park so location was perfect for me. I thought the bar was a little expensive for wine but I guess that's Dublin prices. On the whole an excellent hotel with great value rates. Would recommend to anyone and will definitely be back to stay again.",5,2011,03,01
211,Wonderful stay,"We stayed at the Croke Park for 6 days in February and enjoyed our entire stay. Since our plane had picked up a ""tail wind"" from the States we arrived at 5:30AM - I thought for sure we'd be able to leave our bags and then we'd have to make the most of our early arrival with a breakfast somewhere.  That was not the case - when I asked if we could leave our bags I was asked if we wouldn't like to go up to our rooms first - both of our rooms were ready and waiting.  I could have hugged her.  Then she informed us that breakfast was served until 10:30 and to please go the dining room if we wished.......
Staff is responsive - concierge fantastic.  During our stay the Hop on Hop off Bus began making a daily stop at 10AM - such a great way to get around for the first two days until you get your bearings.
One night we had an issue with our sink - the stopper was stuck. It was fixed within 10 minutes of our call.  We also had difficulty connecting to the wireless internet - it required a tech to come to the room - 15 minutes from the time the call came until the issue was resolved.
Ate breakfast in the resturant daily - good choices and terrific service but it is a typical breakfast buffet so keep that in mind.  Had dinner one night in the hotel as well because we were going to the theater and the food was well priced and very good.  
I wish we had been closer to the center of town on some days because it was a hike from across the river (we were there on some very windy days and some rainy evenings). The Croke Park stadium is directly across the road and I am sure on match days there is a lot of traffic on the road and probably a good deal more people in the hotel.  
Staff is terrific - friendly, knowledgable and guest focused.  Rooms were large for Europoean standards, comfortable and clean.  I would say the rooms were a bit dark however - one more light in the hallway would have made all the difference but I get that they are trying to be environmentally friendly.  
I would stay here again~ loved it.",5,2011,03,01
211,One of the Best..,"Where do i start,
Definitely visit the Croke Park if you are looking for a modern mid-level luxury hotel in Dublin. The hotel is very sophisticated. The restaurant and lounge serve great food in a modern atmosphere. The staff is helpful, the room large, the bathroom brand new--it has everything a traveler needs for an exceptional stay. Very clean, very appealing to the eye, very comfortable. 
One the best in dublin,will be staying there again.",5,2011,02,27
211,Superb!,"On our 6-day trip to Ireland, we were spoiled the first day by our stay at the Croke Park Hotel. Lovely room, very clean with a large, well-appointed bath. Very comfortable beds. Excellent staff and absolutely wonderful concierge service. The menu and food service in both the bistro and restaurant were also great. There was always quick attendance to our questions and needs. While it is a walk from the city center, it is worth it to stay in such a nice hotel with such great service. This was also the location of our last night in Ireland and it was like coming home to return there after the previous hotel.  This is an excellent site, whether you are visiting for business or leisure.  You won't be disappointed.",5,2011,02,25
211,Best hotel I ever stayed at,"My husband and I stayed for five nights on a combination air and hotel package. For what we paid, we received excellent value. In spite of a 6:00 am arrival, we were accommodated quite graciously. Our room was prepared efficiently to accommodate my feather allegy. The entire hotel was immaculate. I have never stayed in such a clean hotel,  even a newly renovated one. Even the  grout in the shower was pristine. The guest room was spacious and well appointed. Internet access in the room was free. There was WiFi in public areas. 

The dining room was well appointed. You have a choice of full Irish or a generous Continental breakfast (ordinarily not included in room charge). Porridge was made to order. The morning newspaper was ready in the dining room at no charge. Dinner was also available. Expect to pay as you would in a fine restaurant. All of the staff were quite pleasant and helpful. We were even offered bottles of water upon departure.

The hotel is right opposite a major sports venue, so there was some noise in public rooms on game days but hotel corridors on guest floors were quiet. There are no restaurants or shops close-by. The hotel is a good ten minute walk from public transport but that walk gets you to the Drumcondra railway station, city and inter-city buses as well as an Aircoach airport bus. A taxi from the center of Dublin was about eight to ten Euro (Feb. 2011).

All other hotels will now be judged by Croke Park standards!",5,2011,02,25
211,THE BEST IN IRELAND,"Myself and my husband booked into this hotel 22nd February 2011 just for an over night stay, I cannot rate it highly enough, as soon as you walk in the door, the reception area is so welcoming and comfortable, the staff on reception greet you with a smile, they are outstanding and so professional.
We were extremely impressed with the security system, the lifts will not go up to the bedroom areas unless you have your room card than has to be swiped through a machine in the lift.
The bedroom were so comfortable, and spotlessly clean, everything you need in it, from the kettle, tea & coffee, milk &sugar, trouser press, iron & ironing board, stocked mini fridge and a flat screen television, in the bathroom shampoos and shower gels, & shower caps,towels & face cloths, the bed was a out of this world, best nights sleep we have had in years, even though there were people on the same floor as us, we could hear nothing.
Going down to breakfast in the morning we passed a few of the bedroom staff and everyone of them greeted us with Good Morning, so pleasant and polite.
Breakfast in the morning; hard to put that into words, it was outstanding, such a selection of everything and all piping hot, the dinning room was almost full when we got down at 9.30am and everything was running like clock work, what really impressed us was you can see directly into the kitchen area and it was spotless, there was a chef inside there busy cooking and he was spotless.
Last but by no means least, I would like to tell you about Stephen Brannigan the head Concierge, he is such a gentleman can't do enough for you, ask him anything and he will have the answer, he was so invaluable to us giving advice on how to get here and there, Stephen is such an asset to the hotel and such a lovely polite and pleasant man to talk to.
Thank You Stephen for all your help.....

Unfortunately I have read two very negative comments about this hotel on this site, the hotel manager has commented on them, there are some people who just love to give bad reviews, I can assure you those reviews are unfounded.

Of all the hotels in Ireland this has to be top of the list
Well done to all concerned, if we are in Dublin again we will be back.......",5,2011,02,23
211,"Courteous, Clean, Comfortable = Terrific","We spent five nights at the Hotel. We arrived early in the morning after an overnight flight and they graciously accommodated us on arrival. The room was terrific, comfortable, and spotless. The communication was excellent, e.g., a letter noting that the morning after a major attraction at Croke Park, early breakfast might be a good idea (it was). The Croke Park crowd on Saturday evening was loud, but little was heard in our first-floor room. The full breakfast (included in our tour price) was most substantial. This was perhaps our best hotel experience ever.  Easy access from the Aircoach or 747 bus from Dublin Airport -- get off at Clonliffe Road and walk east until you see Croke Park a block away on the left, and turn left to walk to hotel.",5,2011,02,21
211,Amazing Staff & Exceptionally Clean Rooms,"I upgraded to the Croke Park as part of an all inclusive package from Aer Lingus. Since the Aer Lingus room type description didn't match any of the room types for Croke Park, I sent an email to confirm. I mentioned in the email we were arriving early and it was my boyfriend's birthday. My email was answered within 20 minutes. They said no problem to arriving early and they would make sure we had a nice room with a king sized bed. Additionally, the let me know they could decorate the room for me on his birthday for a surprise. 

Checked in at 10:00 a.m. with no problem. Room was very clean, bed very comfortable and when we came back after some pub visits, they had put up balloons and a Happy Birthday sign. 

Full breakfast was included and I was shocked at the amount of the choices. Food was good - both breakfast and a dinner we ate at the hotel.

Parking was also included which I'm led to understand is generally very expensive. 

Staff was exceptionally friendly and helpful. I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone.",4,2011,02,20
211,"Fabulous, great hotel, wonderful staff","Stayed there for 2 nights, had the breakfast buffet both days and a 3 course meal at the bistro one of the nights. The hotel really made our trip to Dublin a great experience. Would highly recommend",5,2011,02,20
211,"Great hotel, quick walk to town","Great hotel, good reviews lead me here and I second them! Great value for a Dublin hotel, helped get us into our room very early (9am) as they could see the jet lag on my face! Wish I stayed two nights instead of one.",5,2011,02,18
211,The best place to stay in Dublin.,"I could go on forever about how great of a hotel the Croke Park is. Service is beyond expectations (concierge was so helpful, front desk staff etc). I even left items of clothing behind and they offered to ship it to my home address. A great gym, restaurant and the room is incredibly large for a European hotel. Close walk to centre of Dublin (maybe 10 min walk).",5,2011,02,18
211,"Nice hotel, a few tweaks might help it be great.","Stayed three nights here in early Feb.  We arrived very early and were given a room without waiting.  This is a big bonus in our eyes.  The room was tidy and I have no complaints about it.  The beds were very comfortable.  The turndown service was nice and the ""hottie"" for my feet was really appreciated after a day in the cold out and about in the city.  It was exceptionally cold in Dublin the days we were there!

The hotel itself is a bit off the beaten path and although one can walk down to O'Connell Street, it is a bit of a hike and you would almost certainly not want to do it at night.  At least we did not want to.  It's about 10 Euro to get a cab either way so that can add up quickly.  We were aware of this ahead of time so there was no suprise for us but  it could upset those who did not know.

If you get your hop-on-hop-off bus tour ticket from the concierge, they pick you up at  at the hotel at 10 am for the days your ticket is valid.  If you miss that pick up, you are out of luck and will have to walk or cab down to a regular stop.  It would be nice if the hotel offered some kind of shuttle service at regularly scheduled times/stations throughout the day.  A service like that would go a long way to making folks more likely to stay here.

We had the upgraded room with the robe, slippers, breakfast and a drink each night.  The welcome letter clearly states to go to the executive lounge for the drink and the time to get your drink.  No one was there so we went to the front desk and asked.  They seemed to not have any idea what we were talking about but sent us in to the bar and took care of us.  The foks in the bar also didn't seem to know what we were talking about.  They were polite and all, but I would suggest to the management to better inform all employees of this inclusion and to correct the letter so it states that the customer should go to the bar (with letter in hand) to collect the drink.  It was just a bit uncomfortable to have to explain ourselves each evening.  Once we got through it each night there were no problems and anything else we ordered was delivered without incident. I loved the big fireplace in the bar.
 
The food we had in both the bar and in the restaurant was very good.  I can recommed eating there with no hesitation.

We also had continental breakfast in the executive lounge included with our room.  We were more than happy with that as we are not big breakfast eaters.  There was cold cereal, a variety of pastries, tea, coffee, juice, cheese, meats and yogurt.  More than enough to pick from.  The girl who was working that room was also very sweet.

Don't worry if you get a room with a view of the canal and the commuter train.  The train does not  run at night so there is not a noise problem. The hotel was quite quiet but then again, it didn't seem to be really full either.  I would guess that if there is an event at Croke Park Stadium (directly across the street) you might hear a bit of noise.  

I liked this hotel and would stay here again, hopefully in better weather when the walk would be more pleasant!  If you are not one who likes to walk, this may not be the place for you in spite of how lovely it is.",4,2011,02,16
211,Amazing Staff and Hotel,"Just back from a 3 night stay, got free upgrade and free breakfast, hotel was fully booked on our 1st night and we were moved to city centre hotel on O'Connell St - Amazing! When we returned Croke park, It was perfect! Soon as we seen our room, we didnt wasnt to leave! Received free tickets to Croke park which was a great touch!! Would defo return to this hotel. Best hotel, i have ever stayed in!",5,2011,02,13
211,What a pleasant surprise!!!,"Staff welcoming on arrival and so helpful!!  Rooms large and well equipped with Flat screen, DVD, CD player, Iron and board, minibar, safe and a really lovely bathroom. Great towels and toiletries.  The bed was soo comfortable and what a great nights sleep!  Very clean.  Great service at breakfast with the usual buffet fare of hot food, cereals, bread and freshly squeezed orange juice!!  Totally worth the stay if your up for a match in Croker!!!  Worth every single of its 4 stars!!!",5,2011,02,11
211,excellent,"We have just arrived back from this hotel and had a wonderfull stay. Rooms and all the facilities you could ask for were here from hot towels on arrival to two bottles of water on leaving ( taken from us at customs ) The breakfasts were hot with a good variety to suit all,The restaurant staff could not do enough for you with tea coffee and toast on the table within minutes of getting In the dining room. The rooms were spotlessly clean and a huge bed  flat screen tv and a music dvd player If required, A beautifull bathroom with clean towels daily.the only bad part was all the dog excrement on the footpaths between the hotel and Dublin and the Romanian gipsies begging on the streets In Dublin City but will not detract us from visiting again",5,2011,02,10
211,Fabulous hotel with everything our family needed,"We stumbled across this fabulous hotel in a brochure from the Belfast Tourist Information. We were lucky enough to book a family room at the last minute at a great price, which included breakfast and a tour of Croke Park. The family room was so comfortable we decided to stay another night and relax before moving on. Free undercover parking was an added incentive.

Our teenage boys enjoyed the free internet access in the downstairs lobby while we enjoyed a relaxing drink in the stylish bar. We ate at the hotel on both nights and, after traipsing around Dublin all day, this option was convenient and enjoyable. On the first night we ate in the restaurant and the food was delicious. On the second night we ate in the bar area and watched the football. Whilst the menu wasn't as extensive as the restaurant, the food was just as nice. The buffet breakfast was excellent and we had the best coffee in our entire month's holiday. 

The hotel is within an easy walk into Dublin city and we spent the whole day using the hop on hop off bus tours, which provided a nice warm option when the cold really started to get to us. The staff at the hotel to be very attentive and friendly and the bill at the end of our stay was a pleasant surprise!",5,2011,02,09
211,"Beautiful Hotel, Lovely Staff, Lovely Food, Great Location.","I stayed at this hotel last weekend and would like to highly recommend it.   My friend had stayed there twice in the last few months so we were upgraded without requesting it and given hot towels at reception to freshen up after our long day.   There were lovely robes in the room and comfy slippers.  The staff were friendly and professional and very helpful.  We had an evening meal as part of our deal and we did find the menu very limited but nevertheless we enjoyed our meal.   The breakfast was excellent with a wide choice of foods on offer.   We were also given access to the Executive Lounge where there was a flat screen TV and comfy couches, tea, coffee and fresh fruit and fruit juices available free of charge. The location of the hotel is ideal for a visit to the city centre and there is a free taxi service if you don't want to walk.   All in all a very enjoyable experience which we will repeat soon hopefully.",5,2011,02,09
211,Fantastic,"I stayed here for one night on Saturday 29th Jan , I've stayed in previous Doyle collection hotels and I have to say i've had the same experience here as I have had in their 5* hotels , we were greeted on arrival and given our room details , the hotel is very easy to navigate around.

The room was gorgeous really spacious and had everything we needed , the bathroom was huge and had a separate bath and shower , lots of hotels and good quality lotions and shampoos , they even had complimentary slippers and bath robes! we slept like two peas in a pod in the big comfy bed! 

When we returned from our night out we also ordered room service which was really nice and not expensive.

the next morning we went for breakfast , what a selection you could choose from a fry to fruit and cereal , our waiter gave us fresh tea and toast once we sat down!

On checkout we were greeted by friendly staff and were even given bottles of water on check out!

All in all a very pleasant experience and a fantastic hotel , I would definitely recommend to anyone visiting dublin",5,2011,02,01
211,"fantastic hotel within walking distance of city, 5 Star hotel for 3 Star price!","Lovely clean,friendly hotel. Our room was lovely, fantastic large comfy bed. Fabulous modern bathroom. Hotel was like brand new throughout. excellent friendly and helpful staff. Excellent concierge made arrangements for our evening out the city, dinner reservations, taxis etc. Will be back here and would recommend to anyone, first class hotel, one of the very best I have had the pleasure of staying in!!",5,2011,01,30
211,"Ideal location, great room","This is the hotel I would choose every time for a stay in Dublin city. It is ideally located (especially on match day). The staff were very friendly and helpful. Room was spotless and very comfortable and warm. Bathrooms classy. 
Bar service very good.",4,2011,01,29
211,A lovely hotel.,I stayed here for one night while attending a conference.  The hotel is located directly across from Croke Park a sports stadium in Dublin - it it not within walking distance to the city centre.  The hotel was lovely.  The room was very clean and comfortable and the staff were friendly and helpful. It was convenient to the city centre if you are willing to take a taxi and staff were very helpful in this regard.  I would definitely stay here again and would recommend it to others.,5,2011,01,28
211,Fantastic hotel in Dublin,"What I would right about in this review is pretty much what a lot of the others are writing.  The hotel was fantastic.  Great staff.  Everyone was very accommodating from the front desk to the bartenders to the housekeeping staff.  Clean, beautiful hotel.  The food was delicious.

Down the street is a great little Italian and wine bar called Asti.  It's within walking distance of the hotel and had absolutely wonderful food.  Definitely give it a try if you're staying at Croke Park.",5,2011,01,27
211,"Does what is says on the tin, but nothing special.","I chose this hotel on the basis on the reviews here, and whilst its true that its a modern property, offering decent rooms with space and free internet, I didn't get any ""wow"" feeling and didn't think it was so much better than other hotels in Dublin that I've stayed in, which you would think from some of the reviews.  

I got a decent rate (85 euros) for a mid week Jan stay not including breakfast, and when I asked at checkin for a high floor room, they told me that the third floor was closed off for lack of demand, but the desk clerk kindly upgraded me to the 4th floor which he told me has the ""Deluxe rooms"" on it which was a bonus. The Deluxe rooms seemed  OK though nothing special, but I can't comment what the standard room would have been like. 

On the plus side - rooms have a desk to work at and large comfortable beds (better than other more expensive properties like the Dylan which gets the award for the least comfortable beds in the world, let alone Dublin), but not much other space.   There is also a philips flat screen TV and weirdly a CD HIFI player with no IPod / MP3 facility, but a library of CD's is apparently available in reception - like time travel back to the pre-Ipod era. 

I tried the room service which was Good quality food but fairly expensive with a 5 euro tray delivery fee on top of the food (but most hotels in Dublin are at similar prices), as the location by the Stadium means that you can't easily walk to get a big selection of meals out. 

I was disappointed that my 7:15 wake up call on the first day didn't materialise until 7:30  and when I commented on this, the guy (as its the desk team making the calls manually) said ""Oh sorry"" in a voice that conveyed that he couldn't care less.  Good thing I wasn't on a deadline to catch a flight that morning...  I set my own alarm for the next day when I was.

Would I go back, yes, but only if I couldn't get something in town, or if I needed to be out near the Croke Park stadium, so find myself strangely ambivalent about this property, which is clearly designed to service stadium events more than any thing else. 

Nice  / OK - nothing special, but not bad either.",3,2011,01,24
211,First class all round.,"absolutly first class, stayed in many hotels, not get much better than this, only downside was that there was a very limited choice in the restaurant, although the food was excellent.",5,2011,01,23
211,Best hotel in Dublin,This hotel is just fab - from the lovely staff to the decor.  The rooms are beatifully decorated with very comfortable beds.  Very tasty breakfast.  Would definately recommend this hotel,5,2011,01,23
211,Comfy cozy stay with a fantastic staff and a great breakfast,"We also got this as part of a great package we got with airfare. We are glad we did - it was just about the perfect place to stay in Dublin. We had the same experience as most other travelers on here - got in EARLY from the U.S. and they still got us to our nice room so we could take a nap. The room is just beautiful and welcoming, and sized more to American standards, if you compare it to other typical European hotel rooms. We took advantage of both the breakfast in the morning and the bar at night, and both were great - the breakfast was delicious and the bar was very accommodating. We ordered from the late night menu at the bar, and normally they only deliver to the room, but they were happy to let us enjoy our delicious sandwiches at the bar – a bar that can pour a proper pint of Guinness, by the way – come to Dublin and you’ll realize what that means. I wish they had free Diet Coke at breakfast, but that’s just my craving – a small complaint.

It is about a 15 minute walk from O’Connell Street, which is where the real Dublin downtown action begins. We both like walking so it was no bother at all, and did give you a great introduction to the city. We felt safe during the day, but it is probably a good idea to cab it at night, which is really pretty reasonable, and after a long day you’ll want to anyway. It might be a bit of a disadvantage, but honestly, it is away from the noise and bustle of downtown, so that does have its advantages as well. Again, grab your last pint at the bar downstairs – which has really nice bartenders who can also apparently talk American football; we were watching the Pittsburgh – Ravens game, which was interesting to do in Ireland.

I do wish the hotel had WiFi in more locations, but that is mostly just because of my American Sprint Evo phone only working on WiFi over there. My ThinkPad ran fast on the provided free internet in the room via ethernet cable.

We did think the room was a bit warm the first night, but then we figured out how to work the thermostat, which is a bit tricky, even with the directions that are on a card sitting next to the bed. Here’s a tip – “dehumidify” means “air conditioning”. The shower has unique controls as well but you get the hang of it, and both the shower and the separate tub are beautiful.

Overall, the Croke Park Hotel is HIGHLY recommended, and would definitely be our base in Dublin our next trip, even if it is not part of a package deal.",5,2011,01,19
211,a good base at a good price in Dublin,"we spent five nights at this hotel at the start of our European Christmas holiday, and were more than happy with the location and amenities. the staff were friendly though the stay, the restaurants and bar were inviting at the end of a long day, and the management were very keen to get our feedback afterward to ensure they could make any improvements (although we couldn’t identify any)

we booked a standard room and received a complimentary upgrade to the executive floor which included the continental breakfast and free wi-fi, which was great as there wasn’t much in the way of alternate restaurants or cafes nearby.

whilst it is a little away from the city it’s only a 10-15 minute walk to O'Connell Street. we were happy to use a different path each day and get a better feel for the city, and when we had enough walking or it was raining , the cab fare to or from most places in the city was only €10-12.

the hotel was quiet, although I'm not sure if that would be the case on game days, and we would definitely stay there again.

ps; if you do have a few days in Dublin, make sure you take in Kilmainham prison, the Guiness storehouse, and a train trip down to Dalkey for lunch and onto Killiney to view the coastline",4,2011,01,13
211,Wonderful hotel in every way,"We spent 4 nights here over New Years and could not have been more pleased!  This hotel was included as part of a packaged vacation deal.  Following an exhausting overnight flight, we arrived early in the morning and pleased to find that our room was ready.  We were greeted with warm towels and upgraded to the Executive floor where the rooms were very spacious, tastefully decorated, and immaculate.  The staff could not have been more accommodating.  A very special thanks to the concierge who was helpful in assisting us with purchasing tickets to see ""Scrooge"" and recommending travel routes and points of interest.  

The breakfast buffet was tasty and substantial, waitstaff attentive. While the hotel is away from the downtown area of Dublin, the walk was easy and we felt safe in this quiet neighborhood.  In the evenings, we did use taxi service to return to the hotel and found the rates reasonable.  

An enjoyable time!  If our future travels find us in Dublin, will definitely return to this wonderful hotel!",5,2011,01,13
211,Great food brilliant service will return,We hosted a family celebration there and it was a great day. The food was beautiful and the staff couldn't do enough to help.,5,2011,01,12
211,"Beautiful Hotel, not as close to City Center as others.","The hotel was beautiful, exceptionally clean and the staff was extremely helpful. It was a great value for the package tour we booked. A bonus was the fabulous full Irish breakfast included with the stay - a great way to start each day.
The downsides: the room lighting was dim with all of the lights turned on and we couldn't get the room cool enough at night for sleeping, but the windows did open. Several reviewers mention the distance from the sights, which is a brisk ten minute walk, through a neighborhood that can be sketchy at night - we just took a cab for 7 euros from O'Connell Street each evening to return to the hotel. It was perfectly fine to walk during the day and you were only a few blocks from the Garden of Remembrance, which is quite lovely.
The restaurant was really nice and we enjoyed a delicious lamb dinner on our last night in Dublin - compliments to the chef!
Would recommend.",4,2011,01,12
211,"Awesome hotel, location...not so great.","Here's the thing. Dublin is a walking city, it's easy to get around. The problem with this hotel is it's location. It's too far North of where you want to be if you are in Dublin for the sites.  If you are there for football (soccer in the states!) then this is perfect. It's right across the street from the Croke Park Stadium.  It's a 15 minute walk just to get to the beginning of O'Connell street which is the main street in Dublin. Now that may not sound like a lot, but when you factor in all the other walking you will likely be doing through out the day seeing other parts of the city it can be a drag.  At night, after a full of day of siteseeing, the last thing you want to do is go all the way back to the hotel to then have to turn around and go back.  Additionally, I'm not sure about the neighborhood.  Some of it looks downright sketchy.  At night, the only option for getting back to the hotel would honestly be a cab, I wouldn't walk through that neighborhood by myself any later than 9pm. A cab from Temple Bar area is about 10-15 euros. The interior of the hotel is gorgeous, the rooms were super clean and the hotel staff was amazing. I'm not recommending this hotel to friends simply because of the location. Anyone I know who would be going to Dublin would want to be closer to St. Stephens Green, Temple Bar or the Trinity College areas.  Sorry, the hotel is wonderful, but the location is not.",4,2011,01,10
211,Wonderful hotel,"We only stayed here for an evening the first weekend of December but next time I come to Dublin this is where I will definately be staying again. The room was lovely, there was everything we could have needed, and it was very comfortable. The hotel is furnished tastefully and elegantly, and it was very cosy and welcoming. Great value for money and ideally located for our night out with local Dubliners. Do try the food in the restaurant...it's delicious!",5,2011,01,09
211,Hospitality at its best,Stayed with my daughter to attend Riverdance show.Underground parking very convenient. Receptionist very professional and most importantly welcoming and helpful. First bedroom allocated had smell of tobacco....request for change quickly granted and new room  so spacious and spotless. Beds so comfortable. Ensuite had a bath and shower. A choice is nice. Bar food menu while limited was very good.  Our deal included a voucher towards our meal  ....lovely surprise. Very nice atmosphere there. On return from show the room was so comfy . Breakfast was excellent... a fantastic choice...lots of healthy options if one does not opt for full Irish.  Lovely restaurant  area.  Was not able to avail of late check out of 2.30. great idea for younger folk. On return home was requested by hotel to give review which I did. O[perations manager hoped we would remain satisified customers. We had already booked my daughter in for 2 nights in Dec  before a very important final exam. I emailed the operations manager requesting a quiet comfortable room for my daughter as getting there in extreme weather conditions would in itself be stressful. He assured me she would have that and would be upgraded to an executive room and enjoy benefits of executive lounge. A welcome note and box of chocolates had been left in her room. She had 2 totally stress free days in luxury prior to her exam. She had more time on that visit to observe everything and her overall comment was that every member of staff cooperated in providing the guests with the best possible experience.  Well done  Croke Park... Hospitality at its best. I intend to make many more visits there,5,2011,01,06
211,Probably The Best Hotel In Dublin,This was my sixth or seventh time in Croke Park Hotel and even though it was only for 1 night booked at last minute we were afforded the same service hospitality and overall treatment as always.I would compare the level of service and friendly attitude of staff here as more akin to an intimate country house than that aloof nature encountered in most city hotels.All the facilities of the hotel are most modern and bedroomsare very comfortable ;bathroom has bath and large walk in shower.,5,2011,01,06
211,An excellent hotel,I spent New Year's Eve in Dublin and I stayed at The Croke Park Hotel. It takes you 10-15 minutes to walk to the city centre but it is really simple to reach it. The area is quite and secure: in the evening I often walked alone to the hotel and I never had troubles. Rooms were clean and cosy. We didn't have lunch nor dinner there but I can assure breakfast is tasty and you can choose between typical English breakfast or continental breakfast. I really recommend this hotel,5,2011,01,05
211,"Great Value, Excellent Hotel","I stayed here for two nights after booking online. After booking via their website I stumbled upon a cheaper rate for these nights (which comprised of one cheaper night, one at the same price) on a different website. After filling in the form on their website my booking was changed to reflect the cheaper rate - and we were charged the cheaper night's rate for both nights.
The reception staff were very helpful, booking us a taxi to the airport. The staff in the restaurant were also very friendly, and the food was excellent. We also ordered room service which was quick and good value. 

The rooms were excellent and the bed was fantastic, everything was spotless, Some people have mentioned that the hotel is far away from the centre - It's a 10-15 minute walk. 

My only complaint is that the hotel had wired, not wireless internet in the rooms.Wireless was available in some rooms and areas of the hotel. Wired internet is fine for people with laptops, but when most people use the internet on their phone you really need wireless

I would definitely stay here again.",5,2011,01,03
211,Spot on!!!!,"This hotel is a little gem, we stayed over the New Year all rooms and bathrooms were very spacious, clean and modern. The food in the hotel was excellent and good value for money. It was our first time to Dublin and couldn't have picked a better hotel. All the staff were really friendly and helpful and nothing was too much trouble. The hotel is about 15/20 minute walk to the centre, would defiantly stay again and would recommend the hotel.",5,2011,01,02
211,Wonderful,"This hotel is absolutely wonderful.

The rooms and bathrooms are large, modern and clean.

Room service prices were reasonable and there was a varied menu.

The bar and restaurant were well-appointed and the service was excellent.

If I have one niggle it's that the hotel is a bit far from the city centre, but considering the facilities and service, it's worth the walk.",5,2010,12,31
211,Best Welcome to Dublin for the International Traveler,"My trip to Ireland in October 2010 was the very first time I had ever traveled outside the USA. I was given the trip as present, and I would say that I was VERY nervous about traveling solo to the other side of the Atlantic, but I had always wanted to see Ireland - so I was off.
I had an amazing time! Flew in on Aer Lingus - they were wonderful and it was a very good trip - but, you do arrive after a 9 hour flight just a bit worse for wear. That was the start of an my wonderful experience with The Croke Park hotel, even though  the check-in time was not until 2:00 PM,  they were able to check me in and give me my room right away. My beautiful, spacious, clean room and the bed ... the beautiful, soft bed. Okay, perhaps I am waxing poetic because I was exhausted, and after kicking off my shoes did a face plant into it and slept for a couple hours. 
The rooms are very nice. The bathrooms are large, well appointed and spotlessly clean. The staff - from the front desk to housekeeping - are wonderful, polite, helpful and kind. Even the room service is wonderful - and fast. After a long day of touring when you want nothing more than to settle into your room and relax and plan your next great day in Ireland, I recommend the tempura chicken strips with the sweet chili dipping sauce. Yum! 
I had a wonderful stay and if I should return to Ireland - I would stay with Croke Park again.",5,2010,12,29
211,Excellence from moment of check in till check-out,"Stayed recently in an executive room on 4th floor with access to executive lounge.  Snow in northwest had made me anxious about getting to exam destination however once I  arrived the hotel environment and their staff really were  excellent.  Check in was very welcoming. Room was most comfortable, spotless ensuite and a welcome note and box of chocs . Bar food while limited selection was very good. Breakfast was outstanding in choice of food. All staff have got it so right in terms of service to the guest. Fantastic hotel in every way.",5,2010,12,22
211,Excellent!,"My daughter and I recently stayed at the hotel and we were one of the few people who seemed to have a bad experience in the hotel due to a problem with the heating (see review below entitle disappointed). After my daughter posted her review she was contacted by two members of management team who were very apologetic and very helpful. We were invited back to stay at the hotel. We stayed on Sunday night.

This stay was amazing. It was the polar oposite of the last time we stayed. On arrival we received hot towels and received two keys cards that both worked this time, We went to our room on the 4th floor which was amazing, we had a suite. The room was very comfy and the little touches made our stay. We ordered room service which was lovely and the staff were very pleasant. There was a complimentary bottle of wine and a card from the manager in the room which was very thoughtful. We also had access to the Executive Lounge where we could have tea, coffee, water and have breakfast the next day. The whole stay was fab! It was lovely to feel our complaint was listened to and to experience all the positive things others had written about on this site. Our views on the hotel have changed and we will be back for sure.",5,2010,12,21
211,Fantastic Hotel,"The Croke Park Hotel is fantastic! The staff, the food, everything was just amazing.  Our room was lovely and warm and spotlessly clean.  Keep up the good work!",5,2010,12,20
211,I COULDNT BELIEV IT,"After staying at the Croke Park for a weekend, which was faultless. I received a call 3 days later when I was back in England. The hotel called to say I had left some lost property, they then had my stuff sent to me via recorded delivery at no cost to myself whatsoever!

This is to me is a great hotel!",5,2010,12,17
211,Treated like royalty...,"Booked the Croke Park hotel for my parents 40th wedding anniversary, package also included tickets for the Grand Canal theatre. Everything was fantastic, staff were great, room was great, food was great, transfers to and from the Grand Canal theatre, they loved it. Their room was even decorated with balloons, compliments of the hotel, to mark the occassion. They really felt they were treated like royalty. I booked it all via email through Sinead Gaffney who was an absolute pleasure to deal with it and had everything totally under control.",5,2010,12,15
211,Hard to beat,Faultless. From the hot towel and drinking chocolate at check-in to the breakfast in the morning it will be a tough one to beat in Dublin. The only problem was I'd only booked one night at the Croke Park.,5,2010,12,12
211,"Superb Staff, Superb Food","This is a top, top hotel. The staff are simply the best, from reception to dining room to breakfast. We were so impressed with their friendliness and efficiency. The dinner in the restaurant was absolutely top class, way beyond what we would normally expect from a hotel restaurant. 
The little touches were such a bonus, hot scented towels on arrival at reception and complimentary hot chocolate because the weather was so cold. Also complimentary bottled water from reception at checkout for our drive home.",5,2010,12,06
211,Excellent,"We had a couple of nights there, but as our room was ready when we arrived at 9.55am and we did not have to check out until noon, it gave us much longer than a normal hotel.
The staff were a happy bunch who were competent and ready to help.
The complimentary upgrade to the fourth floor lounge was a brilliant plus.
We had invited a couple to join us for an evening meal : staff made arrangements easily, and the meal was really excellent.
We are Scots, and this was the best porridge we have tasted in an hotel.",5,2010,12,05
211,you have the problem If you are not happy with this hotel...its really really good,"I loved this hotel.  when i arrived i got a hot towel to refresh myself after my journey.  Food in the bar was really scrumptious and i felt really welcome there - the staff had a lovely friendly way.  rooms are great, breakfast was yummy and the hotel was really cosy too.  would recommend for business or holidays.  went to a lovely italian nearby for dinner.  i felt really safe there too with the Garda station just up and across from the hotel.  Taxi's were lined up outside to take me on my way to my meeting.    hard to beat this hotel on all fronts.",5,2010,12,02
211,Great business hotel outside of the Old Town,"We loved the Croke Park Hotel and found the rooms to be comfortable and very spacious -- particularly for a European hotel. The bathroom had a separate shower and bathtub, and the rest of the room was well appointed with a flat screen TV, coffee machine, mini fridge etc. The staff was really helpful on a number of occasions, and our dinner in the Bistro downstairs was excellent. Pretty much the only drawback to this property is its location -- though, if you're in town for a game at Croke Park, the stadium is RIGHT across the street, so the location would be tough to beat then. But for sightseeing, it was a 10 euro cab ride each way to the center of town (around 20 minutes to walk, but it was a bit too cold and snowy last week for us to try)...so we would have preferred to be closer to the Temple Bar area. Otherwise, great hotel!",4,2010,11,30
211,Great service and value,Family enjoyed a long holiday weekend in Dublin for Thanksgiving.  The location is not in center city but a 15 minute walk to the center of town.  Understood this by reading other reviews.  I was not really prepared for the staff - they were outstanding in every way imaginable.  Highly recommend if you are looking to save some money and still want to stay at a quality place.,5,2010,11,30
211,Disappointed!,"I hate to write a negative review when most reviews are excellent, this of course was my reason for choosing this hotel. Perhaps I was expecting too much having read the reviews. Check in was fine, the staff member I dealt with was pleasant. The room was also fine, the bathroom was lovely and big. We ordered a taxi to take us to dinner which the taxi driver told us was never ordered, we ended up waiting for 10 mins. The biggest problem was the room was VERY cold. There was a problem with the window and there was a draft coming into the room. We rang down to reception for extra blankets(usually these would be in a room) and for instructions on the heating as we had it on the highest temperature and it didnt seem to be working. Somebody came up with blankets 5 minutes later and we told them we figured out where the draft was coming from but thye did nothing about it.  The second key card wouldnt work in our door so we had to go back to reception and get this fixed too. We informed staff again about the cold room when checking out and we simply got a ""sorry"". Overall the stay was disappointing and  now have a cold due to the freezing room!!",3,2010,11,29
211,"Irish Hospitality at its best- ""To be sure!""","What a wonderful hotel! Alan Smullen, manager should indeed be very proud of the hotel. They definitely put the guest first and were very flexible with our request to check out, leave our bags with the concierge and return later in the day to use the facilities of the executive lounge. We had not ordered our taxi until 6pm and it made our last few hours in Dublin very comfortable..... and more importantly WARM! The weather was snowy, icy and unseasonably cold for November. This is where I want to address the issues that other guests have raised about the walking distance to the city centre. It is not a problem at all if you are of reasonable fitness. My husband and I walked into Dublin and back ( on the icy pavements on the second day) ,4 times during our stay and it only took about 15 mins to O' Connell Street. (With ice on the pavement it took slightly longer. )If you are unable to walk, or are in a hurry there is apparently a bus service. The staff could also arrange a taxi. The staff are all really friendly people. In fact, I didn't meet anyone there who wasnt helpful or cheerful. We had a lovely time at this hotel and have nothing negative to say about it.",5,2010,11,28
211,Excellent Hotel,"We arrived at 7am after the flight from the states, and the front desk staff was more than accommondating allowing us to check in and get a few hours of sleep.  Restaurant/Lounge always had interesting characters in it, and the room was exceptionally clean and quite comfortable.",5,2010,11,28
211,Would never stay anywhere else.,"I stay here each time i visit Dublin for business. Must have stayed over 10 times in total now and each time have never a fault with the hotel.
Staff are lovely, go out of their way to help you. 
Rooms are immaculate, very modern.
Breakfast is lovely, cant fault it.

I would never choose to stay anywhere else when staying in Dublin. A faultless hotel!!",5,2010,11,28
211,Excellent -  will return,"As I start all reviews as you can see I review a great deal of hotels and I’m not an angry one time guest looking to get revenge. Our stay here was great we started and finished a 3 city week tour with the Croke Park. We liked it so much we left our third hotel a day early so we could spend two final days there. 
This hotel is 4 star even on American Standards, the hotel was new, clean and the staff was GREAT. We arrived at 9am after a overnight flight without issue we were given our room (which is great, but I wouldn't just expect it upon checkout we saw them storing a couples luggage because they didn't have rooms ready) The room is larger than average for Europe and has all the modern features you’d expect. The hotel workout room is very well equipped and the bar and restaurant were both very good. The breakfast buffet was very good, but could see it getting boring if you were staying there a week. If this is the case no one is saying you have to eat here everyday, I’d just eat at one of the many restaurants in the area within walking. 
One source of frustration was the elevator, you must use our room key to get to your floor and MANY people seemed to have issues and it seemed like we were giving elevator lessons every trip up and down. Also there are computers (2) to print boarding passes one computer was broken and the other was being used by a guest to shop online. It would be nice to put a time limit or sign to so the computers could be used for what they are there for. 
Despite other reviews, it is within walking distance of the city center so there is no need for a cab, and I would not even try to drive down there. There is so much to see and do. The hotel is not downtown, but free parking and a short walk it was central enough for me. 
Down the block there is a GREAT italian restaurant, that I would strongly recommend.
This trip was of the Northern tour and we plan on returning to do the southern part and will 100% stay at the Croke Park.  Ireland was wonderful overall and cant wait to return... Cheers!",5,2010,11,27
211,"Excellent, just perfect!","This was just a wonderful hotel for our first night in Dublin!  We even were allowed to check in at 10 AM  (they said this doesn't always happen but they were able to do so for us--probably due to it being off season I think) so we could shower after our long flight and then head out to explore Dublin.  It was a short 15 minute walk although we did have to ask directions a couple of times--not because it was very difficult but we just found ourselves wondering at every street corner how to proceed since they were not always ""straight ahead"".

The room could not have been more comfortable--the beds wonderful!  The buffet traditional Irish breakfast was fantastic and allowed us to leave Dublin early since it started at 6:30 AM.  It went beyond a traditional Irish breakfast and included fresh fruit, pastries, cheeses, oatmeal, cereal and yogurt.",5,2010,11,27
211,Pleasantly Surprised!,"This is a really great hotel. I was a bit reluctant to stay there at first because we were in Dublin for the marathon and the location seemed a bit too far from the start line. We wanted something more central and close to the race. Well I am so glad that we ignored the distance because it was never an issue once we were there. Our room was spacious and spotlessly clean. The bed was super comfortable and generous in size and, we really appreciated the fact that the bathroom was big and there were lots and lots of bubbly stuff for the bathtub (perfect for a post marathon soak). Good breakfast, super friendly staff from check-in to check-out and all for a fantastic rate. Really pleased we stayed there.",4,2010,11,23
211,"Love, Love, Love this hotel","A wonderful hotel,huge  room and huge bathroom which was absolutely spotless.  Could not fault anything in the hotel.  The staff were wonderful. Gave us hot towels when we arrived and bottles of water when we left.  We stayed on 4th floor and had use of executive lounge which was fantastic.  Complimentary drinks and fruit.  Lovely food in restaurant and breakfast was wonderful.  Only fault the hotel has is that it is quite a way from centre of town so we took taxis everywhere but if the hotel was in the centre it would cost an absolute fortune so can't have everything.  All in all wonderful value for money.  Can't wait to stay here again",5,2010,11,22
211,could not have asked for more!,"Me and my partner stayed at this hotel between the 13th and 16th of November 2010 and the hotel and staff are nothing less than superb! We arrived 6 hours early following a very early flight and we were given a early check in at no extra charge. The staff at this hotel are so friendly, helpful and professional. And I would recommend this hotel to anyone who is visiting Dublin.",5,2010,11,21
211,"Will definitely stay here again, Beautiful hotel.","We stayed here for a show in The O2, got a taxi straight outside the hotel and we were outside the O2 in about 5mins. The rooms are lovely, the bed is so comfortable, there is bot shower and bath in the bathroom. Big flat screen tv and music system, everything you want is in the room. it is perfect if you are going to Croke Park you could not get any closer. Its a bit out of the city but there is plenty of buses once you walk for 5 mins to take you into town.i will definitely be stayin here again on my return to Dublin. It even had free parking which is very hard come by in Dublin this was a major plus for me!",5,2010,11,15
211,first class hotel,we stayed at this hotel for the weekend of the aussie rules..The location was brillant as we only  had a few steps to walk  to the croke park stadium...The staff was very pleasant & helpful..the rooms were very clean with lovely crisp white bed linen. the food was excellent..We will def be back at croke park hotel again,5,2010,11,13
211,Great Hotel and good value,"I would recommend this hotel to anyone visiting Dublin. It is a lilltle out of the way of major attractions, but the rates are good and service is tops.",4,2010,11,12
211,A safe haven,"I have stayed here a few times on the eve of my office's annual conference. It's a very smart hotel in a part of Dublin, the main attraction of which is the GAA stadium at Croke Park. As other reviewers have said, you'd feel safe here in daylight, but perhaps not at night. To get to the city centre, when you come out of the hotel, turn right, go over the bridge, up to the junction, up Fitzgibbon Street and follow the signs for the Henry Street area. It might take between 20 and 30 minutes to walk it, but be careful at night. 
The hotel itself is very smart and the staff at reception, the concierge, the bar and restaurant staff are all very pleasant and efficient. In the past, our eve of conference meals have been just about palatable, but this year's meal was really good. There were about 16 of us sitting down to eat (the table had been set for enough of us, but this was amended smartly) and the service was prompt and efficient. 
The corridors in the bedroom areas are bland and anonymous, but the rooms are very comfortable.",4,2010,11,11
211,How can you not love Irish hospitality,"I was concerned about the location of the hotel with regards to walking to and from the City Centre and the reviews I read previously were correct.   It is more then a 15 minute walk to where tourists would want to be and while walking there in daylight is acceptable, I would  never suggest it would be someplace to walk to after dark.  Taxis are available 24/7 and the drivers are worth every penny of the fare as they are charming and chatty and make the trip even more enjoyable.  The restaurant was very nice, the breakfast is wonderful and the staff could not have been more hospitable.  While I will return to Dublin and would most certainly consider a stay at this hotel, if I found a hotel in the city centre that was somewhat affordable, it  would be my first choice.",4,2010,11,09
211,Absolutely fabulous hotel and staff,"Just back from a lovely weekend staying in this fantastic hotel. Value for money was excellent, as was everything else about this Hotel. We were attending a Rugby match in the Aviva stadium and the hotel had door to ground shuttle bus laid on as they appear to do for most major events in Dublin. Food and service was excellent. Free secure underground car parking. Only thing missing from this hotel was a pool and leisure facilities. Hope to be back soon.",5,2010,11,08
211,The most accommodating staff we encountered in Ireland! Great place!,"My boyfriend and I booked a total of 5 nights at the Croke Park Hotel, both the beginning and end of our trip to Ireland. Having lived in Ireland for a little bit I knew that this hotel wasn't going to be in the very center of Dublin like the Gresham, and I preferred it that way. It would only take us about 10 minutes to walk to O'Connell street, add another 10 minutes to get to Temple Bar & Grafton St. Its a pleasant walk, you pass a large Police Station and a cute park along some residential neighborhoods that have a lot of B&B's. The streets you travel are not as touristy as other parts of the city (so you'll see litter) but other than that I felt safe walking back to the hotel, even at 2am. If you are going to see a match at Croke Park, this is the best possible hotel you could ask for.
We arrived at the hotel in the morning on Oct. 2nd, even though check-in wasn't until much later in the day we decided to see if by chance our room was ready since we were beat from our long flight. The staff was amazing! Not only did they allow us an early check-in but they were very informative and helpful. Later that afternoon, I tried to straight iron my hair, so I used my adapter that I used during my last trip, well unfortunately it was busted, so when I plugged in my flat iron, I blew the circuit to our room, how emabarrassing! So I had to walk shamefully down to the desk and explain what I did =(
The concierge was so pleasant (I wish I could remember the gentleman's name), not only did he take a look at my adapter, come upstairs to our room to fix the circuit, but he also offered to let me borrow an flat iron for $20, in which I would get the $20 back upon return. I was so impressed with the service (and the flat iron, it had to be worth at least $150). I was so appreciative!
The rooms were amazing! Everything is updated. large bathroom with a big glass shower and a large tub. Big mirrors to do your hair & make-up in. (Tip, the rooms power won't come on unless you put your room key in the little contraption when you first walk in, same goes with the elevators, which makes the hotel very safe).
The bed was large and great for sleeping. Everything was super clean (the maid staff very friendly as well). The breakfast is very good, I would try not to miss it! The have a very nice bar/restaurant and it gets pretty busy in the evenings. The Fitness facility is not very large but its perfect for the size of the hotel. All the equipment is new. Tv's and music provided along with fresj fruit, newspapers, towels and water. I loved that I could go down in the morning and get a few minutes of exercise in. I also should mention that for those of you who do not want to walk a lot, there's usually always a cab outside for those just in case moments (we had one being late from getting back form the Jameson Distillery (which is def worth a visit as well).
I would highly recommend   this hotel, our stay was perfect!!!",5,2010,11,02
211,Fantastic Hotel,"This was our first stop on our Ireland vacation and we received a warm friendly welcome to the country here.  Our plane got in a 7am, so by the time we collected our car and got to the hotel it was only 10am, and our rooms were not ready but they allowed us to park in the garage, use the main guest baths to freshen up and the concierge was incredibly helpful.  Once we got in the rooms they proved very clean and modern.  Very sizable bathrooms for Europe including a massive tub and separate shower.  Comfortable bed and all the conveniences you could ask for in the room.  The walk to city center wasn't bad at all (and we did it quite a few times!), probably 10-15 minutes.  Overall I would highly recommend this hotel.  We stayed at Burlington Hotel on our last night back in Dublin really wished we had booked the Croke Park Hotel again!",5,2010,11,01
211,"Great hotel, shame about the lifts !!!","The hotel was of excellent quality ! our room was great and an extra bed was added for one of our children. For a hotel so far out of town i thought the food and drink prices were too high. We did not eat there because of this. But my oh my those lifts have a mind of there own. We spent 7 minutes one evening trying to get from the car park ( -1 ) to our room on ( 1 ). With young kids that can be more of a chore thatn you know ! We had to exit one lift at the ground level. it only went down. and wait for another lift to arrive which despite pressing 1 we were dispatched to floor 4 and then back to ground again before eventually getting to our floor on the 4th attempt. No it wasnt us , we met 4 or 5 people who left the lifts in fustration and used the poorly marked stairs.. Come on Ladies and Gents in the Croke park Hotel sort out the lifts and give us more time to enjoy Dublin..",4,2010,10,29
211,Over-priced & shabby,"The place is corporate & soulless, but that's nothing new for a lot of hotel in Ireland & is a matter of taste to be honest so that's not my concern with this place.
I had a series of issues with the hotel which I left a note explaining to the management but the major problems were 
A freezing cold room on check-in so much so I had to leave for an hour for it to become habitable.  
Broken chair
Broken locker door
Tea /coffee stained cups
No bedside lights
All the lighting on one circuit (wall, ceiling, above the bed).
A shower that was plumbed backwards (pressure control marked temperature, temp marked pressure).  
Kitchens that close 1/2 hour earlier if you want to eat in the bar rather than pay an extra €5 for room service.
All in all, I would recommend staying anywhere else in Dublin, unless you REALLY need to be across the road from the stadium.  That's its only saving grace.",1,2010,10,29
211,Great hotel in so-so location,"Stayed at the Croke Park Hotel twice in October. Great hotel with excellent services. Room was large and well decorated. Excellent bathroom with both stall shower and tub. Terrific complimentary breakfast. Also provided complimentary computer and Wifi services. Good staff that provided very fine services. Only negative is its location which was near the airport (good for us), but not near central Dublin. It is right by the Rugby Stadium which was a good landmark, but did not mean anything to us.",5,2010,10,28
211,"Fantastic Best hotel ive stayed in, in Dublin","Stayed in hotel for 2 nites. We were celebrating a special occassion. Upon arrival we had been upgraded to 4th floor. The room had been especially decorated with banners & balloons, as well as complimentry wine!
The staff were awesome & worked hard to ensure we had a lovely stay. Hotel is very clean & modern, some might say out of the way but this made for undisturbed sleep. The food was fantastic especially the fish! Well worth a try. We had dinner in the hotel both nites.
Only suggestion i could make to hotel is live entertainment at the weekend. We definately wouldnt have travelled into the city centre at nite time, had the hotel had a band.
We will definately return to Dublin & to the Croke Park hotel, in the near future, hopefully before christmas!",5,2010,10,25
211,Great Hotel,"I stayed one night, and thought it was great.  Good sized very clean room.  Friendly & helpful staff.  The only drawback I can think of is that it's a bit of a walk to many of the typical Dublin tourist attractions.",5,2010,10,24
211,Very accommodating service,"We arrived in Dublin early Sunday morning. As several other reviewers noted, The Croke Park Hotel was very accommodating in letting us check in early and shower. I can't say enough about how nice they were upon check-in and how that really set the tone for the rest of our Ireland vacation. It really helps when you can drop your luggage and shower before hitting the sites for the day. They helped us book the Hop on- Hop off bus tour which was a short walk from the hotel. The breakfast buffet was good and the room was more than we expected - very nice! The only ""negative"" would be the location. It is not exactly convenient for getting downtown to see the sites, but with one of the hop-on/off bus stops only a 10-15 min. walk away, not a problem. The service and the hotel itself more than made up for the location.",5,2010,10,24
211,My favourite Dublin hotel!,"This was my 4th stay at the Croke Park hotel during the past three years.It is situated 15-20 minute walk or 5 mins in a taxi, to O'Connell Street area. Across the road from the famous stadium of the same name.
A warm greeting from receptionist is guaranteed and check in takes minutes. The rooms are very well appointed and spacious. Lovely large bathroom with nice big shower that you can use in comfort (not like some hotel showers that you feel as if you are in a 'phone box!). Superb large beds and comfortable.
My evening meal was of good quality and reasonably priced. Breakfast is a hot and cold buffet which kept me going until dinner time.
Friendly, good position (for me) near to city centre, good food and good value with Alpharooms. I go to Dublin once a year and would not want to stay anywhere other than the Croke Park hotel.",5,2010,10,21
211,"A bit of a walk to Dublin's attractions, but well worth it!","I really enjoyed my stay at the Croke Park Hotel.  The Staff are very nice, and the concierge was very friendly and helpful.  The hotel it beautiful and modern.  Took me a while to figure out in order to keep the lights on in the room, you must leave your key in the wall unit.  :)  I liked the idea that you needed to use your key to operate the elevator.  This means anyone who is not staying at the hotel will not be able to access it.  The rooms were spacious, and the beds SUPER comfortable!  Best nights sleep the whole trip!  I Loved how big and deep the tub was as well.  Careful....the water is HOT!  :)  There is a mini refrigerator and safe in the closet.  It was nice knowing we could leave valuables locked up in our room while we were sightseeing. There was a large variety to eat for breakfast, though I didn't care for the coffee, everything else was delicious!  I wasn't able to use the computers in the lobby due to a large tour group monopolizing them, but was able to use the free wifi available only in the lobby on my I pod.  If you bring along a lap top, there is also a hook up in the room for it.  They also offer internet through the television in the room, but I was told it doesn't work that well, and if possible to use the computers in the lobby.  Free Parking in the garage underneath was another bonus.  Overall, this was the fanciest hotel I've ever stayed at, and I would recommend it to anyone staying in Dublin.  It's a bit of a walk to the city center, which is a bustle of activity late into the night.  If you would like peace and quiet, this is the place to be.  :)",5,2010,10,19
211,Great Hotel,"We stayed here for 1 night in June while attending an event in Dublin. Once we arrived at the hotel we were sorry we didn't have more time to enjoy it! The public areas are spotlessly clean, very modern and well designed but lots of comfortable areas and a well equipped business area by the looks of things. We got a good deal on an exectuvive room which included breakfast so found it to be good value. The room was a good size with a really comfortable bed, we got mini boxes of chocolates and there was good tea and coffee making facilities with biscuits. Bathroom was great with really nice products, powerful shower. The TV had reasonable pay per view films if we'd had time and there was also free internet through the tv with a keyboard as well - great touch.
The location is a fair jaunt to the city centre so a taxi would be recommended at night but there are a few bars nearby and bus stops one street up. We didn't eat at the hotel or use the bar as we were out late  but there seemed to be a good selection and as mentioned before the decor of the hotel was very appealing. The executive lounge was a nice area and I think there are complimentary drinks at a certain time of the day but we didn't get to use it apart from for breakfast. Breakfast was self service continental - pretty good, pastries, cereal, fruit, cheese and hams and nice juices and tea and coffee. The lounge was pretty busy with airline staff and there seemed to be loads of luggage everywhere so it felt really crowded but that probably isn't always the case. 
The hotel has underground parking which is free for residents, great for Dublin.
All in all,  we loved our room and would love to stay at the hotel again when we have a but more time to make the most of it.",5,2010,10,18
211,"Excellent Hotel and Staff, but it is a long walk to Dublin's popular attractions","I stayed here in early August and the hotel is very nice, the staff, concierge and cleaning staff are excellent.  They have free internet in the lobby (which unlike in the U.S.,  in Europe is not a given) and a nice bar and restaurant.  The rooms were very clean and quiet and the common areas of the hotel were also spotless.  My only complaint is that it is pretty far outside of the main part of Dublin (Trinity College, Grafton St., and Temple Bar).  It's at least a 35 minute walk and from what I was told by some locals, it's not an area that you want to walk at night.  So to get into Dublin proper was a 12-15 Euro cab ride each way so you really had to plan your trips to minimize the expense.  
Bottom line is that this hotel would be perfect if they adopted the U.S. hotel practice of operating a downtown shuttle that would just run periodically to the main sites of Dublin.  Unfortunately, I haven't found a hotel in Europe that runs such shuttles.",4,2010,10,11
211,Nice Hotel in Dublin,"While I felt like it was a bit out of Center City Dublin, it is a wonderful hotel! The rooms are modern, large and clean. The breakfast was great and so was the staff.",5,2010,10,11
211,I found it to be a great value and excellent service.,Good walk to Temple Bar area but took a taxi on the return trip---seemed safer. Wonderful breakfast buffet.,5,2010,10,10
211,Faulous hotel,Hotel is situated right in the heart of dublin - hotel is gorgeous - staff friendly and food is outstanding - intend to be back!!,5,2010,10,05
211,Excellent for Croke Park events.,Stayed here at the end of August & it was very very good.,5,2010,10,03
211,A great week-end in Dublin!,"My friend and I plus our two daughters have just returned from a super week-end in Dublin. The Croke Park hotel was superb, really friendly staff. Spotlessly clean bedrooms. As we were celebrating two birthdays during our visit, we were given complimentary room upgrades. The full Irish breakfast, including the wonderful Porridge, was just great! It set us up for the day. As we were going to the Michael Buble concert, the hotel arranged a coach to transport guests to the concert at the Aviva Stadium, just 10 Euros return. Good value for money.

This is my third visit to the Croke Park Hotel, we all said that we would be very happy to recommend it. We intend to come back to Dublin soon and it will be the same hotel for us!",5,2010,09,27
211,First class hotel. Will definately return when staying in Dublin,"Stayed for two nights with my mother, my best friend and her mother. We were in Dublin to celebrate 2 birthdays and also to see Michael Buble at the Aviva staium.

My parents had stayed here before and now I can see why... Great bar and reception area. Free internet access. Friendly reception staff, especially Sean who had arranged for our rooms to be decorated with balloons etc for our celebrations. We were also fortunate enough to stay on the 4th floor with its own lounge area (quiet area, tv's, free drinks (hot and cold), fruit and snacks. Well worth the extra money. Rooms were spacious and of a hgh standard - my only negative is that the shower was not as hot as i would have liked it to be (but thats nothing to grumble at!). Breakfast was excellent - make sure you go for the Irish breakfast and not the continental (its was delicious!). 5 minute taxi ride to the city centre - we enjoyed a wonderful meal at Peploes (we found this on tripadvisor) . You will not disappointed.",5,2010,09,27
211,More than had been expected,"We had a lovely clean friendly hotel. with a superior cab driver that makes his post at the hotel. patrick Brennan went out of his way to show us Dublin and the easy friendly manner of the Irish. the hotel and its employees were welcoming and helpful, but the cabbies especially Patrick Brennan gave us a throughly favorable impression of the Irish. It brought home everything our (Irish) father left us in gracious memories and laughter filled childhoods. I would recommend this hotel and especially Mr. Brennan to anyone travelling to Dublin. ( I have already recommended the hotel and Mr. Brennan to an American group that plans trips to Ireland). thank you for a wonderful trip to my father's homeland",4,2010,09,23
211,Great Hotel experience,"My wife & I spent our last night in Dublin here and were extremely happy with the experience.
Check-in was fast, easy and extremely courteous.  We happened to also be celebrating
our anniversary and the desk manager upgraded us to a suite. Beautiful room & bath. Internet
(with cables)in the room, comfortable bed, quiet room. We had a quick meal and drinks at the bar.  Food was great and prices reasonable.  Great breakfas buffet also. We were surprised at how close we were to Dublin center.  We were able to have another day to explore a part of the city we missed.
The City museum was fabulous (and free!) I would definitely stay here again when in Dublin.
It's next to Croke stadium, nothing special outside, but a gem on the inside.",5,2010,09,23
211,Still as good as ever,"We stay at this hotel anytime we're in Dublin and I've reviewed in previously on this site.

We there again recently at the football final and it is still as good as ever.  We went there immediately after holidays and a long day travelling.  Teh reception staff were welcoming as ever and greeted my husband by name - they seem to have an amazing capacity for remembering people!  
We were out that night, but as we were leaving reception Sean asked us if we'd like to book dinner as they were very busy - again nice touch that avoids disappointment later!!

Our room was lovely as usual, the beds are so comfortable there.

When we got back that night, we went to bar and the atmosphere was electric there - as a result we stayed up very very late!   There was a letter in our room advising of where food was available over the weekend and advising the breakfast would be very busy next morning.  I had breakfast early and enjoyed it with the complimentary paper.  I needed to go out later to get tickets and the crowds outside were unbelievable.  After the match, it was same, but an entrance is reserved for residents.  

There are alot of things good to say about this hotel, but this weekend what struck me most (as often before) is how well they handle the massive influx of people.  I've never seen hassle there, the security there keep the crowds to an acceptable level inside and there are enough extra bars setup to allow everyone to get a drink.

Once again well done Croke Park!",5,2010,09,23
211,1st Class Hotel,"The directions given on the web page are very clear and concise so, finding the hotel was quick and easy. 
At check in the girl was pleasant and friendly.  There was a little problem with the card keys – we couldn’t get into the room and had to return to reception. The room was bright and spacious; the bed linen was crisp and very comfortable.  The bathroom had a selection of toiletries and fresh clean towels.  The room exceeded our expectations.  Breakfast was beautiful with a selection of fruit/cheeses/hams/Danish as well as a hot buffet.  I am Coeliac and was delighted to find that this was no problem and the waitress brought some beautiful gluten free toasted rolls – excellent! 
Great atmosphere in the bar!
Check out was quick and we were given 2 bottles of water for our journey – it’s the small things that count!
Without a doubt we would recommend this hotel, the staff are extremely friendly and helpful, the hotel is absolutely spotlessly clean and it a great location, just a 10 minute walk to the city centre. Excellent value.",5,2010,09,21
211,Great time had by all.,"A group of us stayed in the hotel for the All Ireland football final weekend.
Some of my friends arrived at the hotel at 9:30am and got to check in straight away which was very much appreciated .
When we checked in at around 3pm the hotel was starting to get busy but the staff where very efficent and got us checked in very quickly without any fuss.
We didn't eat dinner in the hotel but my wife had a sandwich which was nice, I thought the menu was fairly limited and quite expensive but I suppose everything in Dublin is expensive.
We where very disapointed that there was no entertainment in the hotel the night before the match and the hotel bar is just a big room which does not have much in the way of atmosphere unless there is a big crowd in.
The breakfast was very nice.
The morning of the match there was a great buzz and an a air of excitement about the place, when I seen the queues of people outside trying to get in I was glad to be resident.
When we came back over after the match the craic in the hotel was great and everybody mixed really well, but again there was no entertainment on Sunday night.
Overall we had a great weekend and a very pleasant experience during our stay, the hotel was lovley , the staff where very good, the rooms where clean ( if I go down next year I would try to get one the corner ones with a balcony looking out on to Croke Park.)
I would definitly stay in this hotel again.",4,2010,09,21
211,My prefered hotel in Dublin,"This hotel is very good value.
The presentation (lobby) feels welcoming. 
The room are standard and look very well maintained.
The bathrooms are standard, very well maintained.
Breakfast and room service are excellent.
I would recommend this hotel to my colleagues.
The free secure parking is a big plus. 
This hotel is not really from walk distance from the city center.",5,2010,09,16
211,Very good hotel,"We stayed for one night:  my husband was on a business trip but I  was just enjoying the break.  The hotel is not situated in the centre of Dublin but there is a good bus service.
Brand new hotel with generous size bedrooms and bathrooms .  Very nice, unfussy, tastefully decorated and pleasant place to stay.",4,2010,09,10
211,EXCELLENT HOTEL,"We visited Ireland for a week in August this year (2010) and used Croke Park Hotel for our first night and last night of our stay. Very convenient for the ferry port back to Holyhead.

The staff were incredibly friendly and very helpful. The rooms were spacious, clean and the beds extremely comfy. The showers were some of the best I have experienced in many years of staying in hotels both in the Uk and Europe. 

We had breakfast which was very filling and had an enormous range from cooked Irish breakfast to Continental. We also had one of the best bar meals I think we have ever had - I was incredibly impressed.

The staff are truly committed and dedicated to helping you. They gave us a complementary delayed check out, the car parking was free and secure, and we had a great view of Croke Park stadium from our room. The reason I mention this was because we arrived on a Saturday and there were two matches playing at Croke Park. The hotel was absolutely crammed full of Gaelic football supporters but all were well behaved, friendly and good natured despite copious amounts of alcohol being consumed. I wish the UK could learn from this!

The only criticism of the hotel I had was having to get a taxi into and back from Dublin city centre - it was very expensive 25 euros! However, on the last day we used our car and drove into Dublin and found a very reasonably priced multi-storey car park near Trinity College.

It is the brilliant staff that make this hotel and the excellent accommodation.",5,2010,09,08
211,GREAT PLEASANT COMFORTABLE STAY,"Decided to stay in Dublin last minute after Tipp winning all Ireland Hurling final, the receptionist and staff were just a pleasure to deal with and nothing was a problem to them.  We booked very late in evening but this was not an issue and the rooms are just soooooo comfortable.  We had a very good experience and would highly recommend this hotel and will definately be back.  Great breakfast too.",5,2010,09,06
211,"great hotel, great staff, great food, great ambience","Once inside the hotel, everything about it is top class! The staff are so helpful, obliging and efficient! I experienced an issue with air-con in my room which was addressed straightaway and I returned to my room to find a note from the duty manager and some complimentary chocs - a lovely touch!  A further minor problem  one of our party encountered led to her being given another room within 10 mins of alerting reception - and this was about 1 o'clock in the morning! 
Excellent breakfast and excellent food in the restaurant - full marks to the chef and his staff!
A really friendly atmosphere and  staff who seem to enjoy their work and take pride in it.",5,2010,09,04
211,A Little gem in Dublin,"I must admit, I used to stay here all the time on business 4/5 years ago when the hotel wasnt long opened, so coming back and paying my own money to stay here should tell you something.

Although the name has changed I didnt really notice much difference, I even recognised many of the staff - always a good sign. (Trying to be a bit more up-market by hiding the Jury's name I think)

The rooms are all excellent, but if you can pay the extra money for the fouth floor, do it - and if possible get a room with a view of the canal. Whatever you do dont accept a room overlooking the courtyard especially if there is anything on at Croke Park!

All in all was lovely to be back in Dublin and lovely to be back at The Croke Park.",5,2010,09,02
211,"smart hotel,smart staff,smart service","we had a wonderful weekend break at modern croke park hotel, 20 mins taxi from airport, situated opposite the magnificent 80000 seater croke park stadium,where we saw the semi-final of the all-ireland gaelic football match last sunday. Atmosphere was cracking,craic great and Guinness top notch on terrace bar. the Baristo bistro is very good value with staff quick, courteous and attentive,likewise reception and knowledgeable concierge.The superior room was nicely furnished with immaculate shower/ bath and satellite tv too. We had an all- in price for 194 euros for 2  persons for 2 nights ,one on DBB and one on BB.20 mins walk to dublin centre,bus nearby. Taxi to airport 20 euros. And take the GAA stadium tour-a revealing Irish  history lesson too. Go now! Ryanair to/from Edinburgh was on time, but Micheal O'Leary's planes depart from satellite extension gate 100-120, a long 15 mins travelator plus walk from security check..!Thanks trip advisor-this was the best bargain break we have had! ,",5,2010,09,02
211,Not the best but worth a try.,"My girlfriend and I stayed at the Croke Park Hotel from 29th-31st August 2010 during our four day break to dublin.  We had both read some fantastic reviews about the hotel and we were both very much looking forward to our stay as the highlight of our trip.  However, we left midday on the Tuesday feeling somewhat a little let down by our experience and feeling there are other hotels in the city that can provide the same experience (if not better) for a much more cost effective price. 

Firstly, we arrived at the hotel to a large number of people that were obvioulsy there to watch the Rugby match that afternoon at Croke Park. We were greeted by steel railings around the entrance and two security guards that stated we were only allowed entrance if we were checking in. The lobby was extremely busy, however we managed to get to the reception desk to check in. We did not receive our complimentary hot towels from the staff behind the reception but did not complain and headed straight for our room.  The presence of the supporters was clearly still evident later that evening as we were still being served with plastic cups at 10.00pm! 

We stayed in room 337 as part of the Travel Zoo offer. Overall, the room was very nice but personally I considered the beds to be very stiff and woke each morning with an aching back. This wasn't helped any further by the dodgy shower in the room. The shower cubicle overall is lovely, very modern, contemporary and stylish but this was somewhat marred by the amount of water which poured down the back of the shower head and each time flooded the bathroom floor. We had to use two hand towels to mop this up each time and the floor was still sodden.  The shower head itself had a grey rubber seal that had come away from the fitting and caused the water to flow down the glass shower door and down the gap at the bottom. The door itself could not be opened unless you put your full weight behind it. Very dangerous with the door being glass but all in all just something you just don't want to worry about. 

Our complimentary robes were taken away for some reason after the first night when we had'nt even used them, much to my girlfriends dismay. However, the matching complimentary slippers had been left in the room but they just seemed a little pointless on there own. 

The room service I found to be very confusing. The first night we ordered some dinner, which arrived within 20mins and delievered by a very polite gentleman. He asked whether I wanted to pay now or charge the meal to my room and due to the convenience I charged the meal to our room as our credit card details had already been left at reception. On the 2nd night, we arrived back at the hotel shortly after 1am and rang room service for a bottle of wine. Our first request of Rose wine was not available (well it was as half a bottle) so we opted for a bottle of white which came around ten mins later. We were told on this occasion we could not charge the item to our room so I had to pay in cash in person. The lady who delivered the wine had to go back to reception for some change and bring it back to us, which I found highly inconvenient and unecessary. 

I'm not surprised the breakfast is free with the offer; breakfast time reminded me a bit like an all you can eat buffet. Everything is put is tins with lids over and you just help yourself, which is replenished every now and again by the chefs. Again it was just dissapointing.

On the day we were departing, a bill was pushed under our door which I found to be a little in-personal. The bill included the price for the stay, our room and more surprisingly a number of items that we did not consume from the mini-bar. This was corrected at reception, however, the mistake is probably due to the very very clumsy mini-bar door which would not open. Again, just not what you expect from a so called 'top-class' hotel. 

Overall, the hotel is very nice, is in an excellent location but I'am afraid it doesn't provide you with that little extra that you look for especially on your holiday. Its worth the visit with the offer but I would not pay the usual full price for a stay.",3,2010,09,01
211,"Excellent, 4* hotel, friendly, clean, modern in a lovely city.","This was a long weekend stay, bought through Travelzoo. Amazing value for money we were upgraded to a lovely room on the 4th floor with the use of the executive lounge, champagne and strawberries in the room, complimentary drinks each evening and a complimentary 3 course meal on one evening. A big 6foot bed which was very, very comfortable, squashy pillows and no room next door noise or road noise from outside which made coming home to the room brilliant after a long day exploring beautiful Dublin.
We really enjoyed this hotel, both breakfast and dinner were delicious and huge portions of food, the smoked salmon starter was a meal in itself. The room was big, very clean with an interesting view.  The staff were friendly and although the semi finals of the Gaelic football were on during our stay and there were lots of supporters staying at the hotel the atmosphere was great and really buzzing and we could not hear the celebrations in our room.
The only drawback is the hotels location, a good 15 minute walk from the city centre and not in the best part of Dublin BUT this did not stop our enjoyment and would not stop us returning.  It would be great if the The Doyle Collection management could persuade Dublin bus company to stop nearer the hotel and include this area in their bus maps. We caught the Airlink bus from the airport with the Freedom 72 hour bus pass which was brilliant and a great way to see Dublin. Much better value than getting taxi's.
Thanks Croke Park for a lovely weekend.",5,2010,09,01
211,Great value in a beautiful hotel!!,"We stayed in the hotel for the gaa semi final for one night. We got checked in and the room was lovely. The hotel itself and the rooms are spotless and very well laid out!robes and slippers were laid out on the bed for us on arrival along with chocolates on the bed which was a nice touch. Also the hotel has the gaelic theme running throughout with many pictures of past matches and player profiles and portraits running throughout which was interesting. The hotel was very busy match day but a great atmosphere!the only downside was that there were security at the front door of the hotel and although i stated we were stayin in the hotel and wanted up to our rooms we were told we had to go around the back through the bar to get in to the lounge to get to our rooms which is pretty silly considering the bar was packed!we had a very peaceful nights sleep and never heard any noise from the bar or passing trains whatsoever!we went down for breakfast the next morning which was tasty, however there were a few issues. Firstly there were no bowls for fruit or cereal i asked one of the staff whose reply was a grunt. Another guest then told me they'd asked for bowls ten minutes ago so we waited and waited and waited.Fianlly they came out, however they were roasting so cereal out ofn a roasting bowl wasn't very appealing.Next they ran out of milk, mushrooms, bacon etc maybe better management is needed. The staff are mixed (irish and eastern european) the language barrier is a problem as when one of our party asked if there were any more danish pastries (they'd ran out again) we were told no by a very unfriendly man whose english wasn't good, only two seconds later for an irish staff member to bring out a huge bowl of pastries!The food itself was lovely very tasty and good selection. All in all a beautiful, clean hotel in a great location with great food great and great location-only thing that let it down was ignorant and unhelpful eastern european workers. Tip employ more irish workers as those working in the hotel were very friendly and helpful and the fact they could communicate unlike the others was a plus.",4,2010,08,30
211,Mixed Emotions on Stay...,"I stayed under the Travel Zoo special. The rate was great! The hotel caters to tour bus business and budget travelers, neither of which is normally me! The lobby area is very loud and busy with all of the bus travelers and families with children. 

Michael at the reception desk in the afternoons and evenings is quite the nice person. He is extremely helpful. It is clear he truly cares guests are happy.

The staff in the lounge is excellent. They are just a bunch of nice, young men who help each other with each table to be sure all food is delivered immediately and nobody has an empty glass. They are a pleasure! 

The breakfast buffet is not so good. The food, marginal. The restaurant staff, excellent. 

Housekeeping finishes at noon. Each day I found a note under my door stating they could not service my room because I had the ""do not disturb"" sign out. I think noon is quite early for a hotel to stop servicing rooms when guests with jet lag may like to sleep a little later! 

The location is UGLY! The stadium is right across the street. The neighborhood not pretty either. From the lounge it is possible to see a building with razor wire and bars on it. Not exactly where I would like to stay under normal circumstances. There must have been problems at some point because the hotel is full of security cameras and a card key is needed to get the elevator to work. 

Concierge I would say is what I would expect at a Motel 6, but in fairness, Dublin just lacks good tourist services. The concierge recommended the ""Hop on Hop off"" bus for a city tour. It moves like a snail and takes 15 minutes to go between very close stops because so many people are constantly getting on and off. Not a good tour at all! 

Executive lounge is open around the clock for use of coffee machine and juice. That is a nice feature. Not very well stocked, but nice to have.",3,2010,08,28
211,Great location - 10 mins walk to city centre,"We got a great deal on this hotel through Travelzoo - it included upgraded room, champagne on arrival, a drink for both of us on each of the 2 nights,full breakfast each day and dinner on one evening.  The hotel is new and modern with very well appointed rooms and the staff are extremely helpful and friendly.  The breakfastsand dinner were superb.  Parking is free which is almost unheard of in Dublin! The location is opposite the Croke Park GAA stadium which is in a rather unprepossessing street.  However don't be put off by this as the beauty of it is that it is only 10 mins walk to O'Connell St.  Also there is a very good wine bar just along the street which we ate in on one night.  I would definitely go again and recommend this to any tourist of any age",4,2010,08,28
211,nice hotel,"we spent two nights at the Croke Park as part of the travelzoo offer. For the money it was great value and it was close enough to town -15 minute walk to O'connell street, 25 minute walk to Temple Bar (we paid 12 euro for a taxi to temple bar after a long day walking!).
The only downside was that our dinner reservation had not been processed but this was quickly rectified with minimum of fuss.
A definite plus point with the upgrade to a deluxe room was the access to the executive lounge- was great to have breakfast there (though only continental which was fine for us) and to have access to an outdoor space without having to go downstairs. The late checkout was very much appreciated after spending a night sampling the irish hospitality!
Dublin itself was great but if we went again we would stay closer to the temple bar area - there was very little, other than the stadium, in the hotel area.
Staff were very friendly and helpful, public areas were clean and stylish. overall a pleasant stay at a great price.",4,2010,08,27
211,Wonderful Hotel,"Came to Dublin on business and also in order to spend some time with my elderly mother. 

Ticked all the boxes for business purposes with free broadband in room and quiet locations throughout the hotel, a business centre for conf calls and an area to print out documentation if needed. 

Where the hotel shone was in the genuine feeling you get that they want to help out as much as possible. My elderly mum was very happy to stay in the hotel all day and we all enjoyed their fantastic breakfast. Both bar and restaurant meals very high quality with a reasonable price tag. Attentiveness of staff great. 

Checkin and checkout very good and efficient, with the huge bonus of a very respectable room rate without all the added ""extras"" which I have fallen victim to in other hotels. 

Would thoroughly recommend and look forward to my next stay.

Thanks to Erica and all the team for their efforts in accommodating us and allowing for some great family time.",5,2010,08,27
211,HOPE THE HOTEL REMAINS AS WONDERFUL!!!!,"We spent the last two nights of our holiday here and had a fantastic time. There was a big match on the day we arrived so the hotel was very very busy. This is something to consider if you have small children. The staff however coped well and we were served at the bar in no time at all. Rooms were spotless, just a little small when you have a double bed and two singles. We would def go back and hope that there are somemore special offers.",5,2010,08,26
211,Good value for money in a lovely hotel.,"Stayed here for 3 nights with partner. The hotel is lovely and very comfortable with a good mix of business and leisure guests. The rooms are a good size, clean and very modern. On the whole we were pleased with the hotel and staff.
The hotel is about a 15 - 25 minute walk to the city centre but we knew that when we booked it. The reason we chose the hotel was because we had the car and it was able to garuntee parking. Drinks were quite pricey but this is the norm for Dublin. Breakfast had a great choice but felt really hectic, as if there wasn't enough staff on or they were not that well organised but when you did get served they were very polite. Loved the complimentary bottles of water we were given as we checked out, it was a really nice touch especially as we were driving back up to Belfast to get the ferry home.",5,2010,08,26
211,very helpfull staff,"we are on our last night of a 4 day trip to dublin, and what a wonderfull place we picked to stay just 10-15 mins walk from o connell st. staff are great very nice bar, restauraunt and accomodation staff were all very good,the rooms are moden spacious and spotless food in the bar is a bit pricey compared to other restaurants in dublin but seriously the choclate fondant is worth every cent!!! overall a great hotel  big thanks to ye all",5,2010,08,25
211,"hospitality at it's best, don't miss out!","What a wonderful experience! The staff are so courteous and friendly and go that extra mile to make your stay, perfect in every way, wish we could have stayed longer. The staff are a credit to their employers!",5,2010,08,24
211,A sheer delight for lots of reasons,"Firstly you couldn't get closer to the Croke Park stadium without actually being in it.  This was a refreshing surprise after so many other hotels alleging to be close to theatres, stadia and airports actually turn out to be miles away.

The staff was the second good point about this hotel is the staff.  They were superb.  When I did have a serious gripe, they handled it so well it isn't even worth mentioning here what the problem was.

The food was faultless.  Room service excellent.  Room mini bar prices compared well to an actual Dublin bar.

I was only at the Croke Park for 3 days but would defo stay for much longer if I needed to.

One warning.  This hotel is a healthy (20 minutes) walk from the centre of Dublin.  There are buses (16/16a/41) to town about 8 minutes walk away.",5,2010,08,24
211,I never normally write reviews but I feel...,I never normally write reviews but I feel that this hotel thoroughly deserves one. I must say that it deserves the ratings it gets. The service is excellent and the staff cannot do enough to ensure your stay is perfect. I was there as part of a Travel Zoo offer and everything was as expected. The walk to the city centre is about 30 minutes but we were glad to do this to walk off the calories consumed with the fantastic breakfasts. I hope I get the opportunity to return to sample some more Irish hospitality,5,2010,08,24
211,Wonderful place,"Very happy with accomadations, staff and food.. they went out of their way to make sure our stay was memorable and it was. It was a great way to end our vacation of england, scotland and ireland.",5,2010,08,23

211,Excellent Hotel and excellent staff.,"I could not fault my recent stay at the Croke Park Hotel. The rooms were excellent with  comfortable beds & lovely bathroom,
 The service from the staff in Reception , Bar and Breakfast/dining room was excellent. They were friendly and approachable and nothing was too much trouble .The staff  went about their work with a willing cheerfulness which is hard to find these days.",5,2010,08,23
211,attention to detail,"just up for a gig in O2 for one night with a bit of shopping and a few drinks , we recieved a warm welcome , rooms were a good size and spotless, the bathroom was just lovely , loved the robes and slippers, the food was beautiful and all of the staff so friendly they could not do enough for us, very quiet hotel so is ideal if you want a lie in , I will be going back again ,",5,2010,08,21
211,excellent hotel,"Loved every minute of our 2 nights in this fabulous hotel which is right across the road from Croke Park Stadium. The hotel and rooms are very clean and everything is very modern and new.
We were there to attend a match & the hotel is very busy on match days but the crowds are away long before bed time!.
We had dinner in the restaurant one of the nights, the menu was basic enough, but couldn't fault the food or service.
The city centre is about 15 mins walk away but a taxi should be taken if returning at night as there are some dodgy areas along the way - but don't let this put you off! I will definitely be back in this hotel!",5,2010,08,21
211,good 4 star hotel,"This is a lovely hotel, but I would avoid on match days if you are not attending the game.
As it happened, we were attending a game so did not mind the pandemonium. I was a bit annoyed at not being allowed in the front door to get to reception after the game. We were ushered around the side of the hotel and had to fight our way through hundreds of people to get to reception.
I must say that the staff coped very well, and even though the dining room was booked out for dinner, they set up an extra table for us and  for another couple who had not booked either.
The rooms are really comfortable and we had great views of the city from the bedroomd window. As we had got an upgrade through the travelzoo promotion, we had use of the executive lounge where they served teas and coffee and soft drinks all day. We checked out the gym which looked really good, but didn't get time to us it. We only stayed for one night, but will definitely return soon.",4,2010,08,19
211,Lovely hotel.,"Myself and 2 friends booked to stay here with an offer through travel zoo, we found the hotel lovely, the reception area, bar and restaurant are modern and decorated well, the bar and restaurant staff couldn't do enough for you they were always coming over checking to see if we were ok or to check if we wanted refills or food it made us feel very welcome. The only issue we had was that we arrived about 8.15 in the morning and obviously didn't expect our room to be ready, but was assured one would be ready at 11, as we had to be up at 3am for the airport, we went back to the hotel for a rest at about 12, to find the room wasn't ready at all and had to wait until 2.15 to finally check in, which wasn't a huge problem but as we where told it would be ready sooner was a bit annoying  and also our room was only set up for 2 guests, (2 towels,2 mugs,2dressing gowns,2 champagne glasses.), which we queried straight away, however didn't end up actually receiving the extra mug and towel until the following evening after asking 3 times. Even though we has this slight issue on a whole the hotel was lovely and i would definitely stay there again. Thank you for a pleasant get away.",4,2010,08,19
211,"Fantastic deal, great hotel","I stayed here with my boyfriend mid-week in August. We got a great deal with 'Travel Zoo' of two nights in an upgraded deluxe room, with champagne and strawberries on arrival, with breakfast on two mornings and a three-course meal on one evening, with vouchers for a free alcoholic drink on each night - only £79 per person! Unfortunately we never got our champagne even though I double-checked at reception when we arrived, however I'm glad to say this was the only let down. The hotel is beautiful, very clean and the staff were very friendly. The large menu serves until 9:30pm and has something for all tastes. The deluxe room was gorgeous - the double power shower amazing! The hotel is directly across from Croke Park stadium and you get the stadium tour at half price if you say you're staying at the hotel. It has free secured parking aswell. It's only 7euros in a taxi to O'Connell street, although the bar in the hotel is great and we stayed here one of the nights, watching football on the large projection screen at the open fire! Really would recommend a stay here, we'll definately be going back for another relaxing break.",4,2010,08,18
211,the best value for money hotel for the tourist and sports fan in Dublin,I am a regular visitor to this hotel and find it is without doubt the best in Dublin. As a GAA fan it is perfect for games and meetings as it is centrally located The hotel does good midweek bargains and is one for anyone to try once and i guarantee you will be back,5,2010,08,17
211,You won't be disappointed with this choice of hotel!!!,"We've just returned from a short break in Dublin and stayed at The Croke Park Hotel.  I booked this hotel as a package deal and what an offer it was!!!  We arrived at the hotel to be greeted by the friendly receptionist Charlie who was very courteous and made us feel welcome at that very point.  
We were upgraded to a deluxe suite and had use of the Executive Lounge also.  We were welcomed on our return from a night out at the races with champagne & strawberries in our room...Very nice gesture indeed!!!... We had breakfast each morning which was excellent, buffet style and the choice was unbelievable, you didn't need lunch after that..
The staff at the hotel were very courteous & professional in their jobs and always went the extra mile to make your stay an enjoyable & memorable one.  Many thanks to Sean who was exceptional.
Hotel facilities and cleaniness were second to none.  The only downfall is the location of the hotel to the city centre, approx 15min walk which was nothing really to the amount of miles we had walked in 2 days(30miles).  Buses were very frequent, and reasonable fares in and around town, taxi's always available from outside the hotel.

I would recommend this hotel, as I said earlier you will not be disappointed!!!",5,2010,08,17
211,Great hotel,Great hotel could not fault it in anyway. Location good 10 min walk to O'Connell Street and Gate Theatre. Staff very helpfull and friendly. The staff and hotel give all the little extras to make your stay great. Breakfast was best I ever had.  Dinner was lovely with good range of choices. We stayed in a Deluxe room on 4th floor and the room and bed was so comfortable I would have loved to bring the bed home. Loved the Hotel and will be back.,5,2010,08,16
211,I could write a whole review on Ciaran at reception,"This is the first time in my life that I had actually been formally welcomed to any hotel and I have been fortunate enough to stay in quite a few.  His name is Ciaran and it said on his badge that he was in training - they could employ him as part of the training team itself!  They were extremely busy but he made us feel as though we were the only ones in the queue - and apparently it had been like that all day.  He gave us a complete rundown of all the services etc and seemed to be genuinely enjoying his role.  The room we were allocated was lovely, cleaning standards excellent and all the wee extras were wonderful.  Breakfast was great - excellent choice of food.  I would def recommend this hotel and hope to stay there again soon.  I would also rec the tour of Croke Park (stadium across the road) only 8.50 euro with a 10% discount for people staying in the hotel.  Our tour guide was Annette and she was fantastic. A great way to spend a couple of hours even if you are not interested in the games.",5,2010,08,16
211,Exceptional hotel in Dublin,"We have just spent a two nights break in the Croke Park Hotel in Dublin. This an exceptional hotel as a base to explore the nations's capital but equally more so to enjoy a first rate hotel with excellent service and quality amenities. I was frequent traveller to another hotel in Dublin but recently standards and quality have slipped due to big chain ownership. The Croke Park Hotel by far exceeds its stars and expectations. The rooms are excellent and the food equally so. Even though the hotel was packed the standards never slipped and the staff handled the entire stay from start to finish with impeccable service and charm. I would highly recommend this hotel and look forward to staying  there again and also hope to stay in the Doyle sister establishments in London, Boston and Washington. I live in Derry and now I have a base in Dublin to accommodate my regular trips to the Capital.",5,2010,08,15
211,"Nice hotel, shame about reception staff","Stayed in this hotel for 4 nights while doing college exams in Croke Park Stadium.
Hotel itself is nice - rooms are modern and have every facility. Cleaning service was excellent. Hotel was lovely and quiet, which was perfect when trying to study. High speed internet was a bonus and came in very handy. Bar food was nice, staff very helpful and friendly.
Unfortunately the same can not be said of the reception staff I dealt with. Our rooms were not ready when we arrived but this was not a problem, however the attitude of the staff was. They were unapologetic. 
I overheard hotel guests being referred to as ""boggers"". (For international readers, this is a derogatory term used by Dublin natives to refer to people from outside Dublin). I have no doubt that this was all in jest, but not very professional.
It was not possible to check out 30 minutes late (after we had finished our final exam), despite the fact that the previous day, many people's rooms still had not been cleaned at 1p.m.
I got the distinct impression that the hotel were happy to take the money of the students doing exams in Croke Park, but weren't interested in providing decent customer service. We suspect that room rate prices were hiked up because of the exams.
Such a pity that a nice hotel is spoiled by such rudeness and unhelpfulness. Because of this, I would not recommend this hotel.",2,2010,08,15
211,A most enjoyable visit,"We stayed in the hotel for two nights and I would not hesitate to recommend it highly.  We are from Tyrone and travelled down with the main purpose of encouraging our team through to the semi finals.  alas for us it was not to be.  But on the upside the hotel was excellent, the staff delightful, allowing us to really enjoy our break regrdless of football disappointment..  I have just finsihed treatment and it meant a lot for myself and family to get away for a few days and we certainly chose well when we chose this hotel. We look forward to returning very soon, maybe at hallowe'en.  Well done everyone in the hotel.",5,2010,08,14
211,Such a pleasure,"We stayed in this hotel on a supervalue Break. We weren’t expecting anything special as we were on a special deal. However, this hotel exceeded our expectations. We received the warmest welcome from the receptionist then we were given a fine room. The staff here are excellent. They couldn’t do enough for you. The phone is our room wasn’t working so I used the phone in bathroom to call reception as I had a query. As the main phone wasn’t working, they wanted to change our room! Breakfast was beautiful with a wide variety to choose from, fruit, cheese, hot breakfast. Yum. The bottle of water on check out gave that extra special touch. Thank you, we will be back.",5,2010,08,10
211,Such a joy to return,"A party of us travelled down for the Tyrone/Dublin match on Saturday 31 July.  Sadly for us it was not Tyrone's day!  However that did not take away from the welcome that we received from the Staff in the hotel. I had spoken with the ever supportive Anne Marie in reception during the week regarding our bookings and she was as gracious as ever.  It was indeed a pleasure to speak with her on the telephone.  She was very efficient, ensuring that each and every one of our rooms were sorted without any fuss and also ensured that our rooms were as close to each other as we had requested - a real professional receptionist in reservations.  Next came Sean!!!   What can I say about the most efficient Front Desk Manager that we have ever encountered?  Words can not describe the efficiency of this young gentleman and the courteousness that he portrayed.  One of Sean's many traits was the fact that he was able to address each and every one of us by our name - he had remembered us all from the previous year.  It was certainly a delight to walk into the foyer and be greeted in such a welcoming manner.  During our stay on Saturday night, I actually overheard many of the guests in the lobby complimenting Sean on his efficiency.  At breakfast on Sunday morning his smiling face in the restaurant certainly helped us to cope with the fact that we would not be scrambling for tickets for the All-Ireland final!! Thank you Sean for your kindness to us as we bade you goodbye for another year. We hope to meet Mr Alan Smullen -Senior  Manager on our  next visit and we wish him well in his new post. We were checked out on Sunday morning by the delightful and gracious Anna and the ever efficient Michal who once again lightened our hearts as we looked across at the stadium and thought 'what's another year - sure it won't be long til we're back'!!!!!  Well done to all in the Croke Park Hotel.  Thank you for making our visit so memorable.",5,2010,08,04
211,perfect,"Hotel opposite Croke Park Stadium. That is why their rate may go up to 400 euro per room for one night - which is sort of ridiculous. We got an internet rate of 90 euro (including the greatest Irish breakfast ever) - and it was really worth every cent. Fantastic room, modern and clean. A taxi driver told us that the neighborhood is kind of dangerous (obviously a lot of drug addicts and homeless people) - but it's ok in the daytime and only a short walk to O'Connell Street/Grafton Street or the Templebar district. Just take a cab at night and enjoy. We loved it there.",5,2010,08,02
211,"The Croke Park Hotel, excellence as standard - it just keeps getting better and better","The Croke Park Hotel excelled itself again!  My husband and I revisited this gem of a hotel for a few days during the first week of July 2010 and I am very pleased to report that the the standards were every bit as high as during our first visit last September.  
It was nice to be offered the hot towels to freshen up on arrival and to be offered help with our luggage if needed.  We were again situated at the front of the hotel with a full view of Croke Park Stadium which we both were delighted about.   The bed was so comfortable, the room cleaned to exacting standards, just as we'd come to expect from this Hotel.  Breakfast was plentiful and it was lovely to have our Tea and Coffee poured for us (along with the offer of more toast/tea/coffee if we wanted it.)  To our delight, Mr Sean Reid, Front Office Manager - who had made our first stay so memorable, immediately remembered our being there before and he, together with the other Reception staff took care of our every need.  It just keeps getting better and better.

We would definitely recommend this hotel, again and again!",5,2010,07,19
211,Not quite as promised - thank God for attentive Concierge!,"Took my parents to a concert in 02 and chose Croke Park Hotel because of the 02 package offered, which included 'Luxury Transfer' to and from venue. This was important to me - as my parents are elderly and I did not want a 2 hour wait for Taxi (as happened previously). 40 minutes after arranged time for pick-up, no sign of transport. Concierge (whos name I missed) intervened and actually arranged for a taxi to take us there and pick us up, so it all worked out in the end.
In isolation, this would have been quite commendable, but I'm afraid, it fell down in a number of other little ways, which maybe I should have addressed there and then - but none of them were HUGE issues. During booking, I requested a smoking room, higher floor as preference - but got 1st floor non-smoking room. The package also indicated we would get free drink on arrival (never materialised) and there was some mention of Bottled water on departure (which would have been a nice touch!). Might also mention that the High Speed internet is anything but!! PLUS the TV in my room didn't work!
On the plus side, I have to say the rooms were both gleaming and my bed very comfortable, the overall vibe is friendly and relaxed, I had stayed before, so thought it ticked all the boxes. Secure carpark is great, breakfast great ... maybe just a slight lack of attention to detail let it down on this occasion.",3,2010,07,18
211,A much welcome relief!,"A ""true"" 4-star hotel!  Beautiful, comfortable, clean and inviting.  The location is not the most desirable, but after having stayed in a so-called quality hotel that was located near city centre I chose this one specifically for its' quality and the positive reviews.  If location is not the most important location for you while visiting Dublin, then I recommend this hotel!",5,2010,07,12
211,Ship it home,"The room was really nice but the bed - Ah, the bed.  If I could have shipped it home, I'd have done it in a NY minute.  Had dinner in the restaurant and the food was delicious.",5,2010,07,12
211,fab hotel,"stayed before night before a match, so handy, no rushing in the morning, beautiful dinner and great breakfast. cant wait to stay again, pity about Galway in hurling match, but hotel i cannot fault at all.- just one thing is getting out after match, don't be in a rush, not allowed untill road quite of pedestrains.",5,2010,07,09
211,Comfortable and Great Service,"We stayed in at this hotel during a long weekend in Dublin in October. We stayed in a superior double room. Well decorated room, comfortable bed, nice bathroom and good room service. Breakfasts were excellent and hotel staff were friendly and always ready to help. 

The hotel location is not ideal as it is about 25 minute walk to the centre from the stadium area, but didn't bother me. It will be my first choice hotel when I return again.",4,2010,07,08
211,Delightful stay,"My husband and I stayed here only one night, and our last night in Ireland before flying out the next morning. Check-in and out were easy. The desk clerk promised that the king bed would be comfy--and he was correct. Parking was provided. The room was very nice and had very good amenities. The Croke Park Stadium is directly across the street, so I believe it would be very crowded and hectic on game days. The neighorhood is fine--we took a walk and it's largely residential. We walked about 4 blocks to find a convenience store. Holy Cross College is at the end of the street.
We ate dinner in the restaurant, and it was good.
Breakfast was included in our stay, and it was a buffet. We were pleased that it opened early (6:30) so we could eat before our early checkout.
After check-in, we did go over to the stadium for a tour and thought it very interesting!",5,2010,07,07
211,A great bargain for the price and quality.,"A really nice hotel in a so-so area but very safe. Not near anything really except the stadium. 10 euro cab ride to the Temple Bar area. The hotel is top notch. The room was very spacious and really, really nice. Restuarant a bit pricey but expected at a hotel like this. We got a great price so a bargain for us.",4,2010,07,04
211,Very nice surprise!,"A friend joined my husband and I on our vacation to Ireland and the UK in June.  Unlike the US, it is very difficult to find hotel rooms with 2 queen size beds.  Most options you have are to pay for 2 rooms or get a room with a bed and a cot...neither option is as appealing.  Our stay at Croke Park was a very nice surprise.  We booked based on the bed configuration but was very pleased with the hotel in general.  The people at reception were very friendly and helpful. We needed extra towels and they were brought right away.  The room itself was very good, clean, comfortable, and large (typical American sized room).  The bar and restaurant were excellent.  There is a large screen TV in the bar (for watching the WC games) and a cool patio outside.  At one point, we decided at 10pm to do a last minute trip out to Newgrange the following day.  The concierge was able to book a reasonably priced, safe and knowledgeable personal driver for us to get out there and back (€40/hour).  My friend accidentally left her photo memory card in the bar and the staff turned it into the front desk.  This hotel is very well priced considering the size of room and all the amenities that come with it (tv, dvd player, free in-room morning coffee/tv, free internet, gym).  The only down side is that it is a little far from the city center.  It is about a 30 minute walk.  We were told not to walk back to the hotel at night...not that it is a very bad area but it is much less populated if something was to happen.  It is about a €15 taxi ride.",5,2010,07,03
211,What a great surprise,"My husband and I booked a 6 day B & B tour to Ireland, with the first night in a hotel, arranged by the tour agency. We flew into Dublin on a red eye, landing at 6am.  After picking up our rental car, again arranged by the agency (beware Dan Dooley hidden fees!!!), we arrived, bleary eyed at the Croke Park.  We expected something less than wonderful since it was booked by the agency,  but were delighted upon driving up to the hotel to see that it was modern, nicely appointed, and clean on the outside.  The real treat was, though, to step up to the check in counter and be taken care of by Charlie.  It was 7 am; we were exhausted and not expecting to be able to get into our room.  But Charlie greeted us with smile and said, no problem, we could be checked into our room.  Although he was a trainee, he handled our check in expertly and quickly.  He was gracious and considerate and helpful, a far cry from the aloof, uncaring clerks (So sorry, check in isn't until 3 pm) that one sometimes has to deal with and that we were expecting.  Breakfast buffet was to be included the next morning; not that morning because we were so early, but Charlie arranged for us to have a complimentary breakfast too, for which we were very grateful.  The rental car person had made our first impression of Ireland less than favorable, but Charlie reversed all that and lived up to the reputation of a gracious friendly people. The concierge on duty was very helpful and kind also, but we didn't get his name.
     Our room was large, clean, modern and comfortable, with a big bath, flat screen TV, wifi, coffee maker, disc player and more.  The beds were comfortable and the curtains were black out that actually worked.  That made a big difference the next morning when it got light at 4 am.
     The hotel is in a rather run down area of town and the walk to city center is 20-30 min.  The largest sports arena in the country is right across the street and I don't know if I'd like be staying there during a sports event.  Charlie warned us not to be walking back from the city after dark, but during the day the walk was safe.  Considering that it didn't get dark until 10:30 or so we had a lot of leeway.
     After a couple of hours sleep we headed off walking towards the city, where we had our first pint of Guinness and an Irish stew at a pub (Davy Byrnes) that a friend of ours had recommended.  Took the hop on/hop off bus tour and the Guinness Storehouse tour, which we recommend.  Saw Trinity College and many more things.  It was still light when we decided to walk back to the hotel.  It was nice entering a place with appealing public areas and guest amenities, like the free computers, where we checked our email.  The evening staff we friendly and helpful.  We didn't go back to the bar or the restaurant to check out menus or entertainment, but retired to the room to collapse in our comfortable bed.
     The next morning's offering was exactly the same as the previous breakfast.  Hot and cold options....mostly what they call the full Irish breakfast.  Eggs, sausages, bacon(really good and much leaner than ours in the states), grilled half tomatoes, delicious brown bread, toast, cold cereal, yogurt, muesli, milk, coffee, tea.  We had this breakfast almost every morning at almost every B & B.  I was quite bored with it by the end of the trip...except for the wonderful brown bread.  But it tasted excellent that morning.
     We checked out and went on our way to Kilkenny.  We are grateful to Charlie for making our first morning in Ireland such a postive experience.",5,2010,07,02
211,"Nice modern hotel, not the best location.","We stayed here as part of a package deal.  We stayed our first and last night during a 6 night trip.  The first time our room was very nice - very modern and pretty big.  The service we received that evening in the restaurant bar, however, kind of lacking.
On our second stay our room was much smaller and smelled very bad - like a sewer.  Thankfully we weren't in the room very much at all.
Overall, this is a nice, newer and modern hotel.  The front desk staff is very helpful.  It is located directly across from the Croke Park Stadium, which is the only good thing about the location.  So unless you're staying there specifically for an event at the stadium it's really not the best option for Dublin.  The surrounding area isn't the best and it's quite a hike into downtown.",3,2010,06,28
211,Great First Impression of Dublin,"This was our first stop in Ireland after a long flight & ordeal in renting a car.  Only minutes from the airport, it is very convenient and easy to find.  We asked to check in 6-7 hours early, and the staff obliged.  Within minutes, we were asleep on the comfortable beds.  

The hotel is beautiful, modern and full of amenities.  While we only stayed one night, we would definitely stay again.",5,2010,06,25
211,BEST bed...EVER!!!!,"This hotel is fabulous!!  Upon arriving at 8:00AM from an overnight flight from Chicago, they greeted us, and had our room ready.  Very nice that we did not have to leave our luggage in a closet, and had our own room to freshen up in.  The hotel is very contemporary, clean lines comfortable furniture.  The rooms were average size, but the beds were the best.  All we talked about the rest of the trip was how well we slept in those luxourious beds!!  The bar is great, has a great bar food menu, the breakfast in the morning as also terrific.  It's only 3-4 blocks from the heart of Dudlin, so it was an easy walk to get on the hop on hop off bus tour.  Concierage was polite and accommodating and very helpful with everything we asked.",5,2010,06,22
211,Deserves all the great reviews,"Brought the wife on a one night ""escape the kids and dog"" trip, was really surprised to see the Croke Park Hotel rate above many of the well known Dublin hotels. 
For around €130 we got a deluxe room which came with access to an executive lounge with free refreshments including a continental breakfast and an excellent coffee machine. This means you get 4 star amenities for half the price of the main Dublin 4 stars. Parking is free in their underground car park. 
The service is first rate, the staff friendly, informal and efficient, our TV wasn't tuned to Channel 4 (big brother for the wife), I mentioned this at reception and someone turned up within minutes to sort it for us.
My wife had doubts about this hotel, the surrounding area doesn't have much going on but if you're looking for comfort and are happy to be 5 mins from the City center by taxi, you'd be mad not to stay here. 
I've stayed in most of the well known Dublin hotels and I enjoyed this more than any other. We'll be back when the kids and dog get too much.",5,2010,06,21
211,"great staff, great hotel","from the moment we arrived everything was perfect!!! there was free underground parking,and the reception staff were friendly and helpful. the bedroom was spotless and had everything you could want-flat screen, cd player etc! the breakfast was substantial and both the bar food and the restaurant food were delicious!! can easily see why this hotel is ranked in the top 10 and we will definitely be returning!! the croke park hotel was flawless!!",5,2010,06,21
211,The perfect stay,"To sum up my 2-day stay I would say: The best hotel experience I had in the recent past.
The hotel is located a bit off the inner city, but everything is within easy reach by foot or bus. A big Plus is the good acess to the airport by public bus for EUR 2.20 for example.
The room was very nice, clean and spaceous. The staff always helpful and available.
The bed was comfortable and the room was quite as the hotel is located in a residential neighborhood. On game days the area gets buisy as the hotel is located right next to Croke Park Stadium. 
The lend bycicles free of charge which is a great way to explore the city.
Breakfast was good, but nothing super-special.
I will definitely return !!",5,2010,06,16
211,Great hotel in Dublin near port/ferry and attractions,"On our return to Dublin from the UK, and two weeks of travel, we were pleasantly suprised by this hotel. Great facilities, nice bathrooms with shower & tub, free parking, internet, all you could ask for a great stay. Would stay here again, no questions asked.",5,2010,06,10
211,Wonderful family trip; great bargain!,"Five family members traveled to Dublin in May  to celebrate our mother's 85th birthday. The staff at the Croke Park Hotel were nothing but accommodating ---  Mr. Stephenson, the hotel manager, even arranged for an early check-in and for birthday balloons and a banner to decorate the room.  Our rooms were clean and comfortable, with a terrific showers and spacious bathrooms. The hotel restaurant provided good breakfasts and a very nice dinner menu. The concierge service, front desk attendants, bar and restaurant personnel and housekeeping staff all  made us feel welcome and provided us with whatever we asked for.  We definitely recommend the Croke Park Hotel to Dublin visitors and would love to visit again.",5,2010,06,08
211,Best Hotel i have ever stayed in...,"Myself and my friend stayed here for one night for the westlife concert.Location is great as the stadium is straight across the road.Dublin center is only about 20mins walk.From the minute we walked in to that hotel it was pure luxury.Staff at the desk were very helpfull as we had arrived early we didnt think we could check in so early but the girl on the desk gave us a room with a lovely view of croke park stadium.The bathroom was quite big,with a bath and a shower.We had the most comfertable beds that i ever slept in.The room had a mini fridge that was well stocked up.We ordered room service and this was very quick.We had our dinner in the hotel and it was the best.One thing about this hotel is the staff go out of there way to help you.When we had to leave on checking out we got a free bottle of water a very nice touch.Looking forward to my next stay at this great hotel...",5,2010,06,07
211,1st class hotel,"Stayed at this hotel numerous nights in May service here very good from front desk,, bar staff, resturant staff and room cleaners they could not do not enough for you. We were in deluxe room which was very nice great beds  lcd tv cd player mini bar and fab bathroom. The breakfast here is great everything from fresh fruit ,cheeses  all hot options and any style of coffee you would want freshly made for you. I would recommend this hotel to anyone its location is a bit out of city center but taxis not too expensive and local buses if you want.",4,2010,06,06
211,Croke Park is a perfect base for exploring Dublin,"We were a group of 7 friends taking our first trip to Ireland, and chose Croke Park when AerLingus included the hotel as an upgrade on one of their vacation packages.  After having read so many positive reviews here on TripAdvisor, we jumped at the opportunity.  After staying for 6 nights, I must say, we were not disappointed in any way.  The hotel is beautiful, quiet, relaxing, and a wonderful place to wake up in and come back to at the end of a day of exploring.  The rooms were beautifully appointed, with full showers and separate tubs.  The tub definitely came in handy after a long day of walking.  The rooms are large, spacious, and well appointed with a desk, table, and wonderful chair by the window to sit in and read.  Water pressure in the shower is fantastic!  Bath items are included - the standard shampoo, soap, bath gel and lotion.  Towels are very large and soft, washcloths and hand towels are provided.  Requesting extras resulted in quick receipt.  One afternoon I requested extra towels from the front desk as I was headed for the elevator, and they were waiting for me by the time I made it up to my room.  There is a safe in the room which was large enough for our laptop and other items.  There are 2 closets (one open, one closed) but drawer space is strictly limited.

The fitness center is a great place to work out, lacking only a jacuzzi or pool. Equipment is modern and clean, and kept up well. There is a small computer area set up outside the fitness center for printing boarding passes, etc. It's fairly hidden from the lobby, so if you don't know it's there, you may miss it.  Note that when you're printing, there are 2 computers, but the printer is only hooked up to one of them.  Make sure you move the cable to your computer if necessary before you try to print.   I would have liked to have wireless access in the rooms, but the wired access was free and fast.

As others have mentioned, it is a 20 minute or so walk into the city center. Connolly Station is about a 10 minute walk, if you wish to take the Luas in to town, or a DART train out to the coast (highly recommend a trip to Malahide).  We opted for taxis most times, and it is about 10 Euro to the Temple Bar district from the hotel.  Note that the taxis charge 1 Euro per each additional person. so when we ordered a 7-person taxi to go to dinner, it would cost us close to 20Euro each way.  Most taxi drivers know the hotel as 'Jurys Croke', that's the quickest way to get your driver to know where you're going.  The concierge and front desk staff were extremely helpful in booking taxis and answering questions, and special requests were met with quick assistance.

We ate dinner in the hotel restaurant twice, once as a group and once just my husband and I.  Both times we were extremely happy with the fare, and the service in the dining room was just as pleasant and impeccable as the service at the desk.  We also hung out as a group in the Bistro many evenings upon our return from the city, and the staff there was extremely responsive.  

I must complement Edward Stephenson on his communications and assistance throughout.  When we initially booked, I had let him know we were coming in early (we had a 5am arrival on Saturday morning) and the staff had a note in hand that we were coming in, and did their best to get us to our rooms as quickly as possible.  We were celebrating our 25th anniversary, and he upgraded my husband and I to a 4th floor (executive) room, which gave us access to the lounge with continental breakfast every morning, water and juice available 24/7, and just another wonderful place to relax and recharge.  He also included the hot breakfast buffet in the restaurant downstairs, which we did avail ourselves of on a few mornings.  You will often find airline crews in the lounge, and we had a good time chatting with them (especially the ones who were Flyers fans, in the midst of the Stanley Cup playoffs!) 

We have already decided we will be returning again to Ireland, and the Croke is the only place in Dublin I would consider staying.",5,2010,06,05
211,"This hotel has a calmess, sence of space and luxury with excellent service","Located opposite the entrance to the Hogan Stand of Croke Park Stadium in Dublin.  Approx a 10eu taxi ride to City Centre.  Taxis normally waiting outside if not Reception will call one for you.  Loved the bar.  Very spacious, lovely raised fireside with big screen.  We ate at the bar and it was lovely.  Great service.  You may have to give a run and jump to get up onto your bed  :)  Bedroom and bathroom spotless and extremely comfortable.  Excellent stay and would highly recommend.",5,2010,05,31
211,Really liked it,"We were very comfortable at this hotel.  Looks very nice.  Free parking.  Computers to use near the lobby.  Nice lounge area.  We got to check in very early (about 11 am) after a long all night flight.  Check in was very fast.  We stayed 2 nights, about a week apart. It was very quiet both nights.   On the second visit, I had lost a couple of the vouchers for our group and was worried about that, but they came up with some backup vouchers which was a relief.   Iit took us some time to figure out how to turn the lights on inour room. I wish we had received some instruction on this.   There is a place to put your room keycard right inside the door to the room.  After we discovered this, we found that you have to leave your keycard in or the lights go back out after a couple of minutes.  Maybe this is not new to other people, but it is the first time we had seen it. It is a very good system for energy conservation, though.  It is quite a walk to the city center, but very doable if you are a walker.  The breakfast is quite expensive and was not included in our room rate, so we did not eat breakfast there.  We did have a light dinner/snack in the lounge one night and it was good.  Our refrigerator with mini bar stayed locked one of the nights, although I had given a credit card to them.  There is only wired internet in the rooms, wifi in the lobby and lounge.",4,2010,05,29
211,Croke Park great hotel on the North of Dublin.,Lovely hotel located right across the street from Croke Park. The staff was wonderful and very accomodating. The warm lavendar scented face cloth upon arrival was much appreciated after our overnight fligt from Boston. The bottle of chilled water on departure was also a nice touch. Rooms comfortable and clean. Use the electric tea pot it is terrific for that end of the long day touring spot of tea. We had the breakfast every monring which is the standard Irish breakfast and had several night caps in the lounge - food was enjoyable. One of the best features is the location because if you are on vacation and eating more than usual the walk from Croke Park to city center is needed.,4,2010,05,23
211,Excellent,"The first thing that impressed me when booking this hotel was that the manager, Mr Edward Stephenson, took the time to reply to all the postings on this website. I was staying with my two children (aged 20 & 22) so I wanted to be absolutely sure that we had three separate beds. No problem after an email to Mr Stephenson. He advised me to book via their website (which was cheaper than the company I usually use) and then to email him the booking number. He then confirmed that he had reserved a three-bed non-smoking room. We got a 10m X 3.5m room with three proper beds, and a bath and separate shower room, for a lesser price than an English Premier Travel Inn. We also had a TV, CD player and kettle with tea/coffee. On top of that is the outstanding service from all staff that others have reported on. Of course it’s the reaction to when things go wrong that show if a hotel is really good. We were due to fly out at 3 pm on Thursday 15th April. We learnt that London airports were closing at midday – the first day of the volcanic ash. Everything was uncertain – except for this hotel. No problem with staying on in the same room at the same nightly rate we had already paid for. The receptionist checked the internet to confirm that our flight had been cancelled and let us use their internet (free) to make alternative travel arrangements. We managed to get a ferry the previous morning and they arranged the taxi and gave us free bottled water for the journey. 

A few tips for travellers. We took the 16A bus from the airport for €1.80 each. Much cheaper than a taxi. The bus driver was happy to call out when we reached our stop by Clonliffe Road. It was then about a 5 minute walk to the hotel. Impossible to miss as it’s by the Croke Park Stadium. We walked into the city centre each day and twice took a taxi home at night. This cost about €11, as they charge an extra €1 for each additional passenger. Interestingly the drivers rounded the fare down to the nearest euro. The drivers advised us to only use taxis with a meter and to ask for a receipt. There have been complaints about the cost of room service – there is a €5 tray charge per person – but this is clearly labelled in the room and no-one is forced to use it! Finally, the hotel has UK 3 pin sockets. We would certainly use this hotel again.",5,2010,05,23
211,A nice gem at the heart of Ireland's sporting headquarters,"This is a perfect hotel if you are visiting Croke Park Stadium.  It is facing the stadium on the same road.  

However if you are just planning a break this hotel is an excellent option.  Attention to detail is very important to the staff at the hotel.  You are made to feel welcome as soon as you arrive.  There are a vast amount of little extras including free car parking, which is very costly in Dublin, free WIFI,  free water and fruit in the gym, you even receive a hot towel on arrival.  This is just a few extra incentives on top of what you expect from a hotel.
The food at the hotel, although a little expensive, is of excellent standard.  All rooms are ensuite and although not huge, has everything you need.  The television in the room includes satellite channels, not just freeview.    

If you are flexible with your stay check the rates before booking as it will be cheaper if sporting events are on, and off peak season.  I will stay here again and would recommend the hotel.",4,2010,05,12
211,"Very nice, comfortable hotel","We stayed at the Croke Park Hotel on the first night of our week long vacation through Aer Lingus.  We arrived at 7 AM, and while I hoped we would be able to get into our room right away I really didn't think that would be at all possible.  So I was very surprised, and very pleased, when we were given our keys at check in!   It was so wonderful to be able to rest for an hour or so, take a shower and freshen up before walking into the center of Dublin to explore.    The room was very sleek and comfortable, the staff very friendly, and the food very good.   Dinner included  a fabulous courgette and mint soup - very wonderful indeed, and lamb for husband and hake for me.  We also had a very nice Irish cheese plate.  Hotels on package deals always make me a bit nervous, which is why I don't usually do package deals, but this was a very nice surprise.",5,2010,05,05
211,Great location any matches,We stayed in the Croke park hotel for the ireland v Scotland game. Great location and free parking was a bouns. That was our 2nd trip and we will be back again.,4,2010,04,22
211,"Highly, highly recommend!","Well just came back from a fabulous trip to Dublin with my 21 y/o daughter.  Got an amazing package through Aer Lingus and chose Croke Park as an upgrade.  Best decision ever! They lived up to their reputation and beyond!  Firstly after travelling some 12 hours (including layover) from the U.S. we got in at 7 am. As we dragged our jet lagged bodies in the lobby where we were welcomed by a ""greeter"" and then to the front desk , they found our reserveration and said they had a room available for us right away! I have never ever experienced that without some sort of begging and huge fee involved.  The dining room and room service was very good.  We ate there at least once a day either breakfast or dinner.  Prices were expected for the convenience of eating in your room. Michael at the front desk was as sweet and helpful as can be.  Every question I had asked was answered happily and politely.  The location is a little out of the way if you don't like walking, but not inconvienent. Only 10 minute walk to city centre or a taxi was only 7 euros to city centre for the cold rainy days we didn't want to walk. This Hotel is wonderful, I am planning on going back this summer to enjoy Dublin even more and I will definitely be going back to Croke Park Hotel.  I highly recommend this hotel if you want a stress free enjoyable stay!",5,2010,04,16
211,"Fab Hotel, Great people, Really enjoyable!","What a fab hotel. W stayed at the Croke 9th-11th April. The Croke has to be one of the best we have stayed in room wise and we have been everywhere!
First things first, if your coming in from the airport get the bus 2.20 for 90 mins travel pass, the bus stop is right outside the airport.  A taxi your looking at between 20 -25 euros so the bus is a great saving.
When arriving at the hotel we were met by Sean at the front desk he was fab full of smiles and could not do enough for us. We were given hot face clothes too.
Sean give us a free upgrade to the 4th floor the executive lounge were fruit, tea, coffee, bottled water, orange juice (the list goes on) is avabilable 24hrs day along with a wonderful continental breakfast (if your not big eaters in the morning its perfect)
The rooms are clean fresh and bright, the bed WOW prefect and we had a view of the cannal running downside the hotel.
We ate our meals in the hotel each night and found the food really nice, the burger and chips 13.95 euros each was really nice and a big thank you to the hotel for the free drink each night, its these little things that makes a difference.
The hotel is a little far out being around a 15 min walk into the centre (its good for the diet) the surrounding area is not that great but the hotel is!
The only thing which i didnt like was we had late check out which cost us 30.00 euros now for 5 hours over thats alot of money, we thought a little greedy! it was like giving in one hand and taking back with the other!
All in all a great stay.

211,Truly amazing. Best hotel ever. Cant wait to go back!!!!!,"Where do I start. Ive so much good to say about this hotel; Firstly free car park. When we got to reception the receptionist, sorry cant remember his name but was on reception fri eve at 8 was so friendly, gave us hot facecloths to freshen up with, checked us in and told us to come down each morning for buffet breakfast that was the best Ive ever tasted and included it free in our package even though we hadnt selected breakfast. The rooms are amazing. I loved the big bathroom with big bath and fab shower. I took photos of it but the photos or even the web site ones dont do it justice. The bedroom was amazing. Cd player in bedroom and cd library in reception to select cds from. The extra touches this hotel supplies are amazing. Newspaper with breakfast and imagine 2 bottles of water when checking out to have on your journey home. We had dinner on first night in hotel. It was beautiful but the breakfast was like nothing Ive ever seen or tasted. Buffet breakfast where the sausages and rashers werent left to swim in grease. We were one of the last down on sun morn and thought food might be a little cold or left for a while but staff seemed to continually top up with fresh food not cooking  a load in bulk and left sitting for ages. I cant wait to go back again and we got such a good deal, Im hoping that I will get it again. I just cant say enough good about this hotel and they even check their reviews on trip advisor every day as receptionist informed me today. It is a 15 min walk to town and if after a days shopping, sightseeing etc you dont feel like the walk back, there is so many buses that go to hotel and the helpful concierge will help you in on all that. Give you maps, numbers of buses etc.I could go on all day and I know Ive left loads of good things out but thank you for a lovely relaxing stress free weekand and the best nights sleep I had in ages in your lovely comfy beds and forgot to mention, was my husband happy to see sky sports and part of your tv channels. Thanks again. Mary Noone.",5,2010,04,11
211,Fabulous Hotel,The Croke was wonderful. Everyone who works here is extremely friendly and helpful.  The rooms are beautiful and our free breakfast was amazing.  Also a major plus the beds were so comfortable.  I highly recommend this Hotel!!!,5,2010,04,09
211,Wonderful experience,"I stayed at the Croke Park Hotel and the people were so helpful and comforting.  The rooms were nice and clean, the shower was hot, and the beds were comfortable.  The concierge was very helpful as well!  The front desk always greated us with a smile and were willing to do anything we needed.  The free breakfast was also way above expectations.  We expected some cold cereal and rolls and instead we had a full hot breakfast.  I would definitely come here again!",5,2010,04,09
211,"Wonderful Hotel, but a little out of the way","This hotel was the one booked by the tour company we used.  It was a little hard to find, but if you just ask for the Croke Park Stadium and Jones Street, you should get directions to it.  The rooms were very nice and clean.  We were on the 2nd floor.  Don't expect a view or anything, as the hotel is right in the middle of a residential area.  It was safe and it had a car park, no charge if you stated at the hotel.  The breakfast included with the room was wonderful and included hot and cold items.  All in all, a great place to say but you will have to either drive or take a taxi to the city center.",4,2010,04,07
211,Excellent Hotel,"We recently stayed at the hotel on the recommendation of a friend who was also returning for a second stay.    Upon arrival we were met by friendly and efficient staff.
Our rooms were well sized and very clean.  The man who cleaned our room clearly took pride in his work.  There was satellite TV showing Sky News/BBC and various Sky Sports Channels so there was a very varied choice available.   It was also possible to borrow CD's to play in your room on the CD System provided.
The bathroom had a large shower and a separate bath and again was immaculate.
The bar has a welcoming atmosphere and again staff were friendly and efficient.There is an  adjoining outside courtyard which I would imagine is very pleasant in warmer weather.
The hotel is situated an approximate ten minute walk from the Air Coach Bus Stop ( Quinns/Croke Park).  
We walked into the City Centre. It takes about 15 minutes to reach the outskirts of the City and a further 5 - 10 mins to reach the Temple Bar area. We are brisk but not fast walkers.
I would not take the walk after dark, although there was nothing to suggest it was not safe - just a personal preference. We simply opted to take a taxi at a cost of ten euros from the City Centre.  
I can only give positive feedback on every aspect of my stay at the hotel and I would return to the hotel for a future stay.",5,2010,04,07
211,Excellent quality off the beaten path...,"To start...we did have a bit of a wait from our international flight, but Stephen was there to watch over us (as well as the front desk staff...Fiona, Charlie, Krishna, Ashley) all were fabulous and the room was beautiful!!  We had a minor problem with our shower door and they offered to move us.  We loved the location of our room, so they fixed it instead!  Excellent staff...excellent service...excellent food in the bar (see Christopher for your beverage needs).  It is a bit of a walk into town (15 min) but well worth it!  Staff will tell you the directions, and offer you choices to eat.  (We recommend Kingfisher for the smoked cod and chips...#6)   The Croke Park cannot be beat for your vacation stay...we will definitely come back again!!  A+",5,2010,04,06
211,Nice room - bad location,"THE GOOD: Beds super comfortable, rooms nice, let us check in early (MUCH appreciated!)
THE BAD: The location really isn't close enough to City Centre (and we're regular walkers).  The walls were a little thin & heard lots of talking & loud doors closing all night (on a Monday)
BOTTOM LINE: Wouldn't stay here if main reason of trip is to see Dublin.  Would stay here for business .",3,2010,04,05
211,"Comfy, but no Irish hospitality","The hotel was nice, but it lacked the charm of other hotels in Ireland.  The beds were comfy and the breakfast was delicious, but the experience wasn't warm as in other places.  None of the staff here was Irish which was a bit sad because I felt like I totally missed out on the famous Irish hospitality.  However, the rooms were comfy and breakfast was great!",4,2010,04,05
211,Great Place to Stay in Dublin,"We stayed one night at the Croke Park Hotel in Dublin the night before flying back to the States.  It is a really great place to stay.  The rooms were incredible, the parking convenient, the staff were superb.  We were somewhat concerned because we had read reviews that it was in a tougher area of Dublin, but we had no problem.  We walked to the City Centre for the St. Paddy's Day Parade and it was a pleasant walk.  Can't say enough good things about our stay in Dublin or the Croke Park Hotel.",5,2010,04,01
211,In a word....FANFLIPPINTASTIC!!!!!,"I am one of those dreaded Americans...over demanding, over spoiled, over here!  Havng over 25 years experience in Event Planning and Marketing....I have stayed in some of the top hotels in the world....and the Croke Park Hotel exceeded ALL of my rather unrealistic expectations.  As the General Manager of a Charity in Ireland, I must keep my charity's budgetary constraints in mind when travelling on business.  Holding to the school of thought that ""you get what you pay for"", I was truly expecting to be content with a mediocre hotel experience (based upon the unbelieveably reasonable rate I received from the Croke Park Hotel).  I could not have been more mistaken.  My stay at the Croke was nothing less than FABULOUS....everything was perfect...from the room, to the food, to the staff.  I could swear the staff must have been trained in the USA....no, actually they were better than some staff I have encountered in the States.  The Croke Park is definitely my hotel of choice now...and I am spreading the news to all of my colleagues and friends.  Thanks a million!

211,The warmest of welcomes to Dublin,"Sometimes you read rave reviews of hotels and wonder how true they can be. Well, we certainly concur with the positive comments of previous reviewers of the Croke Park Stadium Hotel. 
We arrived at 8.30am due to flights and received a very warm welcome despite the room not being available. Warm, friendly smiles on reception, hot hand flannels to wipe away the journey, bags stored - no problem, a big Irish breakfast, and that feeling of being considered important and individual.
Our room was good but smelt of smoke and contained an ashtray despite us emphasising we wanted a non smoking room. We fedback to reception and were whisked away with apology but without fuss to an upgraded room which was excellent.

The atmosphere in the hotel during our St Patricks Day stay of 2 nights was brilliant; staff always had time for you, and the Guiinness was no more expensive than city centre prices!

We must mention Sean the Duty Manager who seemed to be omnipresent all round the hotel and was superb in his handling of our non smoking/smoking room oversight. 
The conceirge was also very helpful. 

The gym was ideal for us, and being only a mile or so from the city centre was fine for us to walk. We were even provided a complimentary tour of the stadium opposite.

This was our first visit to Dublin and the welcome and craic were both great. When we return, guess which hotel we'll be heading for!!",5,2010,03,23
211,Superb,"Stayed at the Croke Park Hotel for 3 nights on the weekend of the Ireland v Wales match. It was booked as a suprise 50th Birthday trip by my wife for me to support Wales on the Saturday. I cannot speak highly enough of the hotel and its staff, from the time we arrived we were made to feel welcome and special. Mr Stephenson, the Manager even upgraded our room to the 4th floor Excutive floor. To my suprise when entering the room the staff had even decorated the room with balloons and happy birthday banners, and also provided 2 bottles of champagne/ice bucket and a copy of the Irish Grand Slam Rugby Book for the 2009 success the team achieved. The room was so clean and fresh and the breakfasts were superb. Once again thank you to everyone at the Croke Park Hotel.",5,2010,03,21
211,Faultless,stayed here for the ireland v wales match. excellent hotel. friendliest staff. considering it was an international weekend. everyone was relaxed helpful & calm. I really was most impressed with the hotel. We had an excellent evening meal and considering just how busy it was buffet breakfast was pretty good too. some of the extremely expensive 5* plus hotels we have stayed in over the past year could well take a leaf out of the croke park hotel's book on customer service and friendliness!,5,2010,03,20
211,SUPERB HOTEL,"Stayed  at  this  hotel  for  the  weekend  with  a  group  of  rugby  friends.The  service  was  fantastic  and  the  location  was  too.The  reception and  concierge  looked  after  us  superbly  by  giving  us  free  match  programmes,bottles  of  water  and  even  finding  tickets  for  the  match  for  us!!The rooms  were  very  clean  and  especially  the  bathrooms.I  can't  stress  how  great  this  hotel  is  and  hopefully  (if  we  get  a  good  price!!) we  will  be  back  next  year.
Many  thanks  from  the  Welsh  supporters  from  Llanberis  Wales.",5,2010,03,16
211,A superb hotel with staff that cannot do enough for you.,"Just back from a few days in Dublin, We stayed at the Croke Park Hotel and had a wonderful time. From start to finish the staff could not have been better.
The room was warm and comfortable.
 The location seems to be an issue, but It is only 10 to 15 min walk to O'connell Street.(we were lucky with the weather).
The taxis can be expensive.
We had b&b for 3 nights and the breakfast's were very good. you can have just about anything you want for breakfast. We did have a meal one evening in the bar that was very good if maybe a little expensive, although it was comparable with most restaurants in the city.
The towels etc. were changed every day and the tea/coffee replenished.
The bathroom was superb with both a bath and walk in shower. flannels,soaps etc were also replaced daily.
on our arrival (which was early) we were given hot towels to freshen us up and they were more than welcome.
My Wife and I cannot praise the hotel and Staff highly enough.
We also plan to return as soon as possible.

I would also like to add that the Irish are lovely people (so polite) and we now class a lot of them as our friends and we would like to thank everyone that we came into contact with for helping to make our trip as good as it was.",5,2010,03,15
211,Is this hotel all it lives up to?  NO,"Well I went back to stay at this hotel as the first time was good.  But this time the person on check in ok, no welcome back good to see you again or hot towels (where is customer care there).  

Asked about dinner and was told yea we server till what ever time, so I asked for a table to be book and I felt that the person checking me in felt oh yea I will when I am ready top do so.  

Went to the bar for a drink and the staff were top class. Then off to the restaurant and ordered a steak which is served with Chips and mushrooms.   My god fro the price they are charging for this they should hang their heads in shame, plate arrived 6 CHIPS, steak was ok in size and  3 large mushrooms all for (I think) €23.00 pure rip off.   Staff in restaurant  were very good, put the food is over priced for what you get and I said the same the last time I stayed.  I don’t think they take guest views on board. 

This hotel is good don’t get me wrong the rooms are great, clean and all that the staff in the Bar and restaurant are top class and work hard.   Reception have to say would not give them top marks.

They say they value your custom, put when it comes to it they do not as I want to book a rate on checking out that I has seen on there web site, but the rate had shot up and I was told that life and noting could be done about the rate so I as do they care about us the guest not really when it comes to it.

I love to say yea I would stay again, but to be honest its over priced and they will fleece you when they can so I this would not be my first choice any more for Dublin  there is hotels in Dublin just as good and cheaper and value their guest.  

The after care is just as important and ye fall down on this",3,2010,03,15
211,Excellent service and amenties,"Michael & Sean were at the front desk when we arrived.  We were greeted with warm towels and cold bottled water to refresh ourselves.  They answered any questions we had about Dublin and Ireland.  Our room was clean and luxurious.  The Sideline Bistro offered a good dinner next to the fire.  The breakfast buffet was outstanding!  While the amenities offered by the Croke were nice, the real treasure is the employees.  Sean went out of his way to help us.  Both he and Michael were kind and friendly.",5,2010,03,11
211,Great place!,"We spent 6 nights here and I would happily return and stay here again. Our flight arrived in Dublin at 8:30 in the morning so I emailed them beforehand to ask if we could check in early. We arrived at the hotel around 9:30 and had to wait a little over an hour for our room. They said the reason was they were fully booked the night before and were assigning rooms as those guests checked out. No complaint here, I was happy not to have to wait until the regular check-in time! We did not have to wait though, we could have left our luggage with them and went out to see the city. Everyone working at the hotel was friendly the hotel was very clean. The workout facility was excellent. We ate breakfast with the hotel most mornings and their Irish breakfast was pretty good too. Pay attention though, if you're watching your money, the hot food items on the buffet are the irish breakfast which is 14.95 euro, and the other items such as cereal, fruit etc... are 9.95 euro. I mention this because no one told us there was a difference, they just said help yourself to the buffet, and we happened to see the sign after we had choosen our food the first day. 

Overall, we had a fantastic stay, and I would love to stay here again when we return to Ireland. The location is not in the city center, but we did not have any difficulty getting there if we chose not to walk, since bus stops and the Drumcundra train station are close by on Dorset (maybe a 5-7 minute walk from the hotel.) 

There were only two minor annoyances that I will mention, first, the free wired internet in our room (Room #221) would not work with the ethernet cable. I tried the one provided by the hotel and one I brought from home. I called support and after asking me to check several things they couldn't get it to work either, and told me they would put it on a higher priority and call me back when they fixed the problem. I contacted them on the first night of our stay, and I did not receive any follow up call from them. Since I didn't feel like dealing with it, I chose to use the free wireless internet in the lobby which worked fine. 

The second thing is that the directions given to us on a map for walking into the city were a little confusing, and the 3 times we tried to follow them we got lost. So, if you are planning to walk to the city center (about 20-25 min walk) I recommend you walk out the front door of the hotel and turn left, then at the next street turn left again, that street is Dorset. Stay on Dorset until you get to Fredrick, (there's a building on the corner with a big clock that says something like Guiness time) turn left. That street will eventually turn into O'Connell, which is where some of the shopping is located, one of the tourist offices, the bus information office, and where several tours begin. If you stay at Croke Park Hotel, you can take the bus (16,16A, 46A and others, go to the bus information office on O'Connell for more info) to the Drumcundra train station on Dorset on your way back to the hotel if you don't feel like walking the whole way.",5,2010,03,11
211,nice hotel!,Nice hotel!  About a 20 minute walk to city center...not bad at all.  If you catch a taxi is about 10 EUR w/ the tip.  Taxi from airport about 28 EUR w/ the tip.  Beds super comfortable...bar is very nice...hotel is very clean & new.  Staff was helpful when we needed them.  No complaints at all & good value for the money.,5,2010,03,08
211,Modern and upscale,"The Croke Park Hotel is a beautiful modern hotel across from the Croke Park Stadium. Our room couldn't have been more comfortable. Lots of pleasant, small touches in decoration and the room is thoughtfully set up. I recommend both the pub and the dining room for delicious meals. We had a wonderful leek and potato soup at lunchtime with sandwiches and pints. At dinner I had salmon with risotto and Dan had cod with a creme fresh sauce, small potatoes and chorizo. Our meals were expertly prepared and presented. The staff is courteous and helpful all around.",5,2010,02,28
211,CONGRATULATIONS TO MANAGEMENT AND STAFF.,"I first stayed in this hotel on Arthur's Day with my son and as soon as we checked in I knew this was a hotel with a difference. On arrival we were given warm towells to freshen up with and checkin was quick and informative.Our room was on the 4th floor and it was fabulous!!! Huge room with 2 double beds and the bathroom was huge as well with seperate shower and bath. The furnishings were luxurious  and everything was fresh,clean and spotless.

I stayed again during a recent rugby weekend and again from checkin we were made to feel like VIP's!!! Usually during a busy w'end like rugby it is not a good time to judge a hotel,staff and service.(going by past experience in other hotels)!!But it was not a problem in Croke Park!!

We got a lovely room again on the 4th floor and it was overlooking Croke Pk,we were well pleased.We also had use of the Executive Lounge which served light b'fast and had papers and magazines. . . very relaxing.

The hotel was buzzing and the atmosphere was electric as people were getting ready to go to the rugby match.We had lunch in the restaurant which was lovely and served quickly.Although there were so many people all wanting food and drink there were lots of staff in restaurants and bars to cope with the amount of people.There were even ""extra"" bars within the bar!!

We had dinner in the restaurant and it again was very good and service was excellent.(we'd been advised at checkin to make dinner reservation for the evening)

Breakfast the next morning was very good.Great service from friendly staff and a nice relaxed atmosphere.Plenty  of lovely food to choose from, and the hot selection was great and piping hot.Again plenty of staff about.

We were offered a lazy checkout which meant we could keep our room for a bit longer so we didn't have to checkout too early which is a great idea.
On checkout we were given little bottles of mineral water for our journey home,which I thought was a nice touch.

I have stayed in other Dublin hotels during busy rugby international weekends and believe me they could learn a lot from the Croke Park Hotel!!!

Nothing is too much trouble,plenty of staff in every department,excellant food,excellant service and excellant atmosphere.

Free underground parking is a big plus.Car is safe and carpark is well lit with lift to reception.

It is clear to see that there is great management and a well trained team of staff.

I'm looking forward to my next weekend in the Croke Park Hotel in March.

211,An all-around perfect stay!,"I just returned from a 4 night stay at the Croke Park Hotel.  Wow, everything was perfect!  From the minute we walked in to Reception and were greeted with warm towels to freshen up to the Housekeeping staff to the Concierge staff it was customer service at its finest.  The first time we requested a taxi, the Concierge asked for our room number.  This was not (as I thought) to charge the fare to our room but to protect the Hotel's guests from rogue cab drivers who try to take advantage of tourists and to locate anything that might have been left behind in the car.  What a nice touch!

As far as the room, it was gorgeous!  Spotless, fully stocked with big, thick towels and complementary coffee and tea are just some of the touches that make the rooms special.  Oh and the bed, ahhhhhh!!!!  I am an early riser always but this bed was so comfortable that I slept in until 11:00am every day!! 

If I didn't give the location it's full worth it's because it is a bit removed from the city center.  I will say, however, that all of the above more than compensates for the distance and on my next trip, the Croke Park will be my hotel of choice.",5,2010,02,09
211,absolutely terrific....looking forward to going backjj!,"I just spent four nights at The Croke Park Hotel and really loved it.  It was my first visit to this hotel, and I therefore had no idea what to expect.  I have always in the past stayed within the city centre when visiting Dublin, so this was slightly further out of the way than I was accustomed to, but it was a completely manageable walk, than can take only 15-20 minutes at a brisk clip.  

We arrived at the hotel very early.  Our flight from NYC arrived at 8 am, much earlier than check-in time.  However, we were greeted pleasantly and welcomed, and a clean room was assigned to us immediately.  

The room was adequately spacious.  Unfortunately, we had booked two double beds, and were offered one double and a twin bed.  It has been many many years since I slept on a twin bed, so it took a bit of adjusting.  The room had a modern and clean style, with excellent amenities, including a very nice flat screen TV.  The furniture and beds were clean and comfortable.  The bathroom was really fantastic.  It contained a large glass-enclosed shower stall as well as a full size bath tub, and a lot of counter space underneath a wall-size mirror.  

The room was literally scrubbed down every morning.   The shower and the bathroom floor sparkled upon our return each afternoon, and the beds and the rest of the room were made up beautifully.   It is clear that a LOT of attention is paid to maintaining a very high level of cleanliness at this hotel.  I don't remember ever before being this impressed by how well serviced a hotel room was.  But this cleanliness was not limited just to the room.  The entire facility was maintained to a superior standard.  Great lighting, great public area furniture, inviting pub and bistro, and great food at the restaurant.   

We had requested a non-smoking room, and this was happily accommodated.  The room didn't smell of smoke at all upon our arrival, which was a relief.  My only disappointment, however, was an unexplainable and VERY strong smell of cigarette smoke that seemed to pump into the room through the ventilation system every morning at about 5 am.  It was such a strong stench, it actually woke me up, dried out my nose, and caused my travel partner a pretty bad asthma attack one morning.   For somebody who smokes, this would obviously not be a problem.  But for me, this was a big negative.  I have a very bad reaction to cigarette smoke, and my clothes smelled like smoke for a few hours each morning.   I suggest that this be looked into, as it was the only real ""gotcha"" in an otherwise flawless visit.

I took advantage of the beautiful fitness center every day.  It was spacious and comfortable, and contained a large selection of equipment.  It was completely under-utilized, as I was the only one there during almost every visit.  I wasn't complaining though.  Fresh fruit, water, and towels were provided.

The location of the hotel is a bit north and to the east of the main visitor attractions of the city center, however, for rugby and soccer fans, this hotel is in the center of that universe, as it is directly across the street from the famous Croke Park, home of the GAA, the Irish athletic assocation that is steeped in history, politics, and tradition in Irish sport.  The stadium is impressive, and contains a fantastic shop for shirts, jackets, shorts, etc. in the colors of the different teams.   

I'm happy to say that I'm returning to The Croke Park Hotel in a couple of weeks.  This time, I'm bringing my mom.  I think she is going to love it, and I'm greatly looking forward to my return.",5,2010,02,08
211,Our only choice for Dublin,"My husband and I have stayed here frequently since it opened.  We have stayed on match weekends, weekends away and weekends where we needed to be in Dublin.  My husband stayed there frequently when he was in Dublin for weekend course work.

We both love it and at this stage wouldn't bother staying anywhere else.  We did ""treat"" ourselves to a more expensive hotel 12 months ago, and to both our minds, didn't compare!  

We stayed here the weekend it opened and fell in love with it.  I love the entrance and the lobby area and the fact that there are little areas to sit and read there.  I love the bedrooms - those beds are so comfortable.  A number of reviewers have commented on the rooms being cold, it's never been my experience.  I've always found the air con to work perfectly well.

I would agree with other reviewers on the food.  The bar food is fine, but very expensive.  I have ordered room service and find the final charge on it prohibitive - a bowl of chips ends up costing an arm and a leg!   We've been there a few times on a weekend break, including dinner.  I've found the menu a little limited every time.  The last time we were on this type of deal, we ate in the restaurant, which was lovely.  However, all previous times, we ate in the room that's across from the bar and I just don't find it nice for an evening meal that I want to relax over - that room is fine for breakfast and fine for having a few drinks in later, but not for dinner!  

We were up recently for my husband's graduation and contacted the hotel prior to travelling to book it.  When we got there the room was decorated, a card there and 2 small bottles champagne.  It really was a lovely touch and hugely appreciated.  

We have asked the concierge for recommendations for restaurants nearby and his recommendations have been spot on.   We had the best Indian there during All-Ireland weekend last year - and it was just along the canal! 

I know the surrounding area isn't pleasant, however, I have walked around there alot - I tend to get lost coming back from town!!!  I've walked along the canal a few times and there have been gangs drinking there - certainly not pleasant to know you have to pass them, but to a group they have been polite - this has occured numerous times over numerous stays!!  

I love when we're staying on 4th floor - and we often pay the extra for it!  That lounge is great - I tend to binge on hot chocolate when I'm there!!!!  It's just lovely to go in and read the papers and it's always so quiet.  We've been in there a few times when there's been a private function on - not realising we shouldn't have come in.  Each time it hasn't been a problem, we get a coffee and a paper and find a seat and stay quiet!!!  We even got invited to have a lunch there one day - we immediately explained we weren't part of the party, but it wasn't an issue us being there.

That lounge was especially wonderful after this year's All-Ireland where we could lick our wounds over a drink, rather than face the bar downstairs.

A previous reviewer commented on the crowds after matches - my experience has been that we've always been able to get through by showing our card.  The crowd-control and security is excellent around matches - the only downside is it does take a littel time to get a drink!!!!  

Despite having been in Croke Park numerous times, we decided to do tour of it last year - highly recommended!  We didn't do the museum that day as we ran out of time, but it does come highly recommended as well.",5,2010,02,03
211,Excellent hotel,"Stayed for just the one night. Got upgraded to the Executive level which was a nice touch. 
Nice big room with all the usual equipment. Executive lounge could have been beter stocked but was nice and relaxing. Excellent breakfast great choice and variety. The staff where very efficient and friendly. Took coach to the O2 arena for a show great to go from door to door in both directions and not have to worry about parking, or getting the Luas back into town, or a taxi. 
After we checked out we could leave our car parked in the under ground carpark for as long as we wanted. We walked into the city centre after check-out and it took only 10 minutes to get to O'Connell street.",5,2010,02,02
211,Plush surroundings and easy to get to city centre,"My husband and I stayed here for a weekend in Dublin.  We were very impressed by the hotel.  The reception area, bar, gym, etc were all very well presented and the staff were all very helpful.

We stayed in one of the executive rooms, which included breakfast in executive lounge, complimentary evening drink, bathrove and slippers and evening turn down service.  Our room was a good size and had all the features you would expect.  The bathroom was immaculate and the housekeeping team provided a very thorough service everyday.

The area next to Croke Park is by no means the best in Dublin but a taxi to the centre only costs $10 or there are regular buses nearby.  Also, during the day it is only a 2 minute walk to O'Connell Street.  I wouldn't reccommend walking at night time.

We would definitely return to the Croke Park Hotel.",4,2010,01,25
211,excellent otel/breakfasts fantastic,"we ended our 15 day tour of Ireland at the Croke Parke, it was one of the nicest hotels we had stayed in on our tour. the only thing we were there in a taxi strike and found it far from center of town, but close to the airport.  internet was free which was different than most. the full irish breakfast was excellent and the staff was nice.
i would recommend it to anyone
mwm",5,2010,01,22
211,Inconvient Location,"I was surprised at the high reviews for this hotel. First of all, the location is terrible. You are a good 20-30 min. walk from the city center. This is alright in the day but a little scary at night.
The rooms are comfortable but are  standard chain ones, nothing special. The breakfasts were not good. The selection was so-so and the staff seemed very disinterested.
On the bright side, the staff in the hotel were very attentive and eager to please. The value is good if you don't mind the location and the breakfasts.",3,2010,01,21
211,Excellent stay! Very impressed by this modern and fashionable hotel!,"Croke Park Hotel was a fantastic getaway for our Dublin anniversary trip! The hotel was beautiful and very new looking, as well as modern (which is at times not often found in these more old world cities). While it is a bit away from the City Centre (about a 20 minute walk), being from NYC where we walk everywhere, this was not a problem at all. Also, while the surrounding neighborhood is a bit deserted in the evenings, taking a cab back from the city to the hotel in the evenings is a piece of cake and not that expensive. Walking to the city during the day is also fine, and really not that long if you are ok with a walk. Aside from that, the hotel itself was excellent! The staff is incredibly attentive and honestly better then some I've seen even at some 5 star hotels. The rooms are well appointed, with comfortable king-size beds, updated amenities and features and spacious bathrooms. My husband and I travel often, and we booked this hotel via a tour company that the fare included the hotel and airfare. At first, we were skeptical thinking that perhaps the pictures would be better then the reality, but were wrong. This was a delightful hotel to stay in and one that my husband and I would definitely stay here again!",5,2010,01,20
211,Very Impressive Hotel,"My boyfriend and I stayed here for one night, our first night in Dublin. Our flight arrived in Dublin at 9 a.m., and we took a cab straight to the hotel, hoping they'd let us drop off our luggage, but they allowed us to check in immediately to an available room. The room was clean and spacious, and the bathroom had a full tub. I would highly recommend this hotel for a peaceful, comfortable stay a little way from the heart of the city.",4,2010,01,18
211,Fabulous,"My family and I spent our last night of a ten day trip in Ireland at the Croke Park Hotel. We happened to pick the worst week of weather Ireland has had in 47 years for our holiday. When we arrived we were met with warm cloths and hot chocolate. The staff, service and accomadations were the best I have ever had. We spent an enjoyable evening winding down after traveling from Cork in less than ideal conditions. This stay will be the one I judge all others by, you can't go wrong here.",5,2010,01,16
211,Great Hotel,"Lovely room, great reasonable food, excellent staff who let me keep my car in the car park for an addtional night free of charge when I was nervous to drive a long distance in the worst night of snow for years.  I will definitely stay here again.",5,2010,01,11
211,Fantastic! Wouldn't even think about going anywhere else next time!,"This hotel exceeded all of our expectations on every level. The hotel was a wow from the moment we walked into reception. We paid nothing compared to what I would say it was worth. £130 for 2 nights! -Fab! 
The room was lovely, lots of extras and above and beyonds! Bathroom immaculate, stand alone shower - big enough for 2 and then a bath as well! Nice to have both, but stand alone shower was amazing to have! 
Bed was the most comfortable bed we have ever slept on!! The sheets and cushions - fabulous! 
Service was great
We couldn't check in straight away so we went to the bar, which is fab! we had lunch - simple food it might seem but absolutely delicious! Nice sparkly wine to top it off! 
Would go again without hesitation! Best hotel I've stayed in, and the price just makes it even better!! 
Little walk to town centre, but only 10 minutes!! Got a taxi back simply cos we got lost!!",5,2010,01,07
211,Nice hotel - handy for the hurling!,"Stayed in Croke park hotel for one night in June. Was pleasently surprised when we checked in. Lobby was modern and attractive. Rooms were also great - modern and very clean - a reasonable size too. Parking was included and we got a great deal booking through expedia - cheaper than the hotel website. Some nice touches like a warm towel to freshen up when you check in and a bottle of water when you check out.

Food was also excellent. Weather was awful when we visited so we had both lunch and dinner here - both meals were really good - only downside was the usual hotel trait of charging extortianate prices for soft drinks.

Not close enough to comfortably walk into the city centre, but you can catch a bus at the end of the road - ~5  mins by bus into city centre. However, the location is obviously great if you are heading to a game of hurling (or football). Good atmosphere in the hotel before the game with people calling in for a bite to eat and/or a drink.",4,2010,01,07
211,The Croke Park Hotel Dublin,Location wise 20 mins walking distance from city centre,4,2010,01,06
211,"Stay elsewhere, if you can afford it","This place was disappointing and it's good to see its Tripadvisor rating has dropped in recent weeks.
It's worth staying here for the price, but that's about it.
Firstly, the area is bad. It's okay during the day, when you can walk into town in about 20 minutes, but we didn't risk it at night. It's quite dark and grim and uninviting. It also lacks things like grocery stores and off-licences, so it's annoying having to pay hotel prices for snacks, drinks, etc. On that subject, DON'T order room service. It is of a ridiculously-low quality. I also didn't like paying a €5 ""tray charge"" on top of the over-priced food.
The rooms are nice and big and look like they were refurbished about five years ago. However, they are absolutely freezing. The AC/heating was useless. We called staff to ask for another duvet and after about 90 minutes they showed up to inform us: ""the heating is on its highest setting"". We asked them again for a duvet, waited a while, asked again, until finally we were brought an oil heater. Adding to my temperature-related frustration were the lukewarm showers.
The fridge in the room was loaded with the usual mini-bar stuff, however, upon removing these to put in my own store-bought drinks, I set off the sensors and was automatically charged by the hotel - not on! These were taken off the bill at chekc-out, but I expect to be able to use a fridge in my hotel room.
When booking, I arranged flowers and champagne (at a cost of €100) in the room to surprise my girlfriend on her birthday. When we checked in, staff told me the flowers hadn't been delivered yet and they should be sent up to our room in an hour. After waiting patiently for nearly four hours I rang the front desk and told them to forget about it. They were apologetic and offered me the champagne complimentary. That helped ease my frustration. However, a sparkling bottle of Italian wine is not champagne, and I would have been very angry to have paid €50 for it.
We had a continental breakfast included in the room price. We didn't upgrade to the full Irish, because it looked awful. Each of our four mornings at the hotel, staff were confused about our breakfast inclusions. They even tried to charge us, despite it being included in the room price and when we checked out, front desk staff AGAIN tried to charge us for breakfasts.
Other gripes with Croke Park include the sub-zero temperatures and inoperable equipment in the fitness suite, and the single-working computer terminal in the lobby, which regularly had to be unlocked by staff.",2,2010,01,04
211,"Great hotel, but too far away from city to walk","Great hotel and the staff were all nice. Although the website says it is a 15 minute walk to the city centre, it is a 35 minute walk to Temple Bar / good shopping areas which on a rainy day is not pleasant! 
Restaurant and bar are great.  Were not impressed with the 5 euro per tray extra for room service.",4,2010,01,03
211,Only one Fault,"I stayed in the hotel  as we had our office Christmas Party. I thought the staff were very pleasant and it was nice to have a smile from the staff. The rooms were lovely, comfortable and clean. We ate in the restaurant that night but the service was pretty bad. We had 5 tables and the service was really slow between meals, the food was cold by the time it got to us, and dessert was melted by the time it got to us (for those who had ice cream). I ordered my usual drink from the bar and it was gone off by one month and the second drink was also gone off by about  4 months which is not good for the stomach. I was also in there bar last October and the exact same thing happened with the drink. There was a mini fridge in the room and drinks were also gone off by months in them. I was disappointed by this one thing but it wouldn't stop me from staying there again as the staff were really pleasant the rooms were lovely plus there is a really nice atmosphere.",3,2010,01,02
211,"believe the other reviews, this hotel is worth a visit","I booked this hotel based solely on the reviews I read on trip advisor and i was not disappointed.  
The lobby and reception area looksvery nice and check in was speedy & efficient.
Our room was a good average sized room.  With a very comfortable bed.  Rooms had a good supply of tea & coffee which was replenished daily and a mini bar, internet access & an iron & ironing board all standard in rooms.
I was most  impressed with the bathroom.  Separate bath & shower, a huge mirror with lots of space and good quality shampoo, conditioner & shower gels.  
Excellent breakfast.  Buffet breakfast, all piping hot with a very good selection of both cooked and continental breakfasts. 
I wouldn't think that this hotel is walking distance from the city unless your feeling energetic.  We travelled by taxi and paid about €10 to get from the hotel to Trinity College.
My other half thought the bar lacked atmosphere on the Friday night of our stay but we were staying here on a weekend when there were no croke park matches on and October isn't peak holiday time.

I booked the hotel over the phone and got a very good deal on two nights with breakfast, parking & late check out.  
I would definitely recommend this hotel and plan to stay here when i'm next staying in Dublin.",5,2009,12,21
211,Great hotel! Absolutely loved it - will definitely stay again!,"I stayed in The Croke Park Hotel recently for my graduation and had booked two rooms. On arrival we were greeted at reception. The member of staff was very pleasant, friendly and helpful. The rooms themselves were lovely - absolutely spotless and spacious enough. They had everything you could possibly want/need and the hotel in general pay great attention to detail. The bathroom was also lovely - nice and spacious with a large shower cubicle and a separate bath and also had a large mirror. The room had a flatscreen TV, CD player, desk area and another large mirror, an iron and ironing board and trouser press. There was lots of space in the wardrobes and was also a mini-bar and extra glasses etc as well as tea/coffee making facilities. The beds were really comfortable and the hotel quiet. There was also water/ice-making facilities on each floor. The next morning the buffet-style breakfast was great. There was a large selection of food to choose from and almost everything you could have wanted e.g. continental breakfast, full-Irish breakfast and also e.g. granola, porridge, fruit etc. We also used the car-parking facilities which were complimentary and were able to take the car in and out as we wished which was really handy. Overall this was a great hotel (at a really affordable price -we got a great deal online) and I am so pleased I chose it based on TripAdvisor reviews. It is spotless, the staff are great, the rooms lovely and the attention to detail is impressive - e.g. the hot towels on arrival and a bottle of water on check-out were really nice. I would most definitely recommend this hotel to anyone and really look forward to staying here again on my next visit to Dublin.",5,2009,12,16
211,The Place to stay when in Dublin,"From arrival to departure absolutely fantastic service. Good size rooms with superb quality bathroom (bath & seperate large walk-in shower). Well cooked buffet breakfast, though disappointed no fried bread, but can't expect everything. Keep up the good work and next time I am in Dublin will definitely be staying with you.",5,2009,12,13
211,Outstanding hotel at a bargain price,"Stayed for the weekend with my husband as a 40th birthday treat. Hotel was amazing value for money, particularly given the expense of Dublin generally. The walk into the centre wasn't too bad and was welcome after a large meal and a few beers! There are regular buses from Mountjoy Sq if the walk is too much. 

Overall fantastic hotel at a great price.",5,2009,12,07
211,Great Hotel!,"We stayed at the Croke Park for 3 nights on 27th November. We took advantage of the travel zoo offer for 1 night and had a standard rate for the other 2 nights as we were unable to have the travel zoo rate for all 3 nights due to the rugby match.
It was my husband's 30th birthday whilst we were staying and the hotel couldn't do enough for us. They had decorated our room prior to our arrival which was a really nice touch. I had also organized for a cake to be brought out at breakfast and the staff sang Happy Birthday.
The room was really spacious and kept very clean. Bathroom was huge - really enjoyed having a bath and a seperate shower. Towels changed on daily basis and there are robes and slippers provided.
Only negative on the room was that I would have prefered to have a thicker duvet. I did ask at reception for an extra one and housekeeping did come up but they left a sheet not a duvet. I asked again at reception and I was told that one would be sent up but it never arrived. I know that I could have put the heating on it the room but I don't like being too stuffy.
We had access to the executive lounge for tea and coffee but it was closed to a private function for quite a bit of our stay so we were unable to enjoy using this extra. There was a sign saying to contact room service if we needed anything but we didn't as it was too much hassle.
Overall our stay was fantastic, It wasn't ruined by the crowd from the rugby as the hotel managed the crowds very well and had security on all entrances to ensure there was no trouble.
We were particuarly impressed by one of the reception staff (guy with blonde hair and glasses - sorry didn't get his name). He was always very helpful and couldn't do enough for us, nothing was too much trouble.
Just a tip for anyone travelling to Croke Park Hotel - we got a local bus from the airport (yellow and blue buses) and asked the driver to let us know when we got to Conliffe Road and then it is just a short walk. These buses cost 2 euros rather than the 8 euros the other buses charge.
Also I agree with one of the other recent reviews - Dublin is expensive with a capital 'E'
We were paying about 12 euros for a pint of guiness and a pint of lager. We could have brought a crate for that back home!!!",5,2009,12,05
211,excellent value for a quality hotel,"This hotel is situated a mile or so north of the centre, just off the bus rout to the airport.   I booked at a good price, thanks to a two night for the price of one offer.
The room was immaculate, the bathroom large and very generously equipped and the breakfast was everything you expect in a big hotel.  Mostimportantly the room was well insulated for sound.",5,2009,12,05
211,Great hotel for Croke events.  Food is a let down,"We went to the Rugby match at Croke and stayed in this hotel, I booked three rooms on a package deal, 2 nights B&B with one evening meal. The hotel scores well on everything and we had no reason for complaint except for one thing. I dont want to be negative to the hotel as yes I definately would return again the plusses by far outweighed the negatives, so I do not want to put anyone off staying here as I know you will enjoy it. The evening meal included in our package was served in the dining room/bistro. We were given the standard menu after we handed in our vouchers. Only after I enquired was I told that there would be a suppliment for the the steak at an extra cost of 10 euros. Fair enough. I ordered the roast beef and it was tough and dried up as if it had been sitting about for a while and reheated. Its sell by date was well past. My other guests meals varied from excellent to rubbish. One, the Caesar salad, was so drowned in dressing it was actually a stomach turner to just look at. The waiting staff did notice it hadnt  been eaten an to be fair they did offer to replace it. The staff were excellent. When we came to leave the restaurant and settle up for the wine etc that we had along with our dinner we were told that there would be an extra charge for the side orders. Now the dinners needed the side orders as they were not complete without them. I insisted that this was unfair as we were not made aware of the charge. I did not refuse to pay for them at any stage, but did voice my disapproval especially as I had previously asked the question. This is NOT about money its about the principle of it. It was volunteered that the manager would be in contact with me with regard to this matter. Unfortunately this did not happen. To have waivered this small charge, there were 3 side orders shared between us, would have been to the hotels financial benefit. After this happening we were so pi##ed off that seven people went elsewhere for the rest of the evening for our drinks. We had been in hotel for pre-match drinks and food and had contributed well to the takings during the day.
One other thing when the match was over the crowds at the door were massive. A seperate entrance for guests would have been good. I got my pocket picked while waiting outside in the melee. I do not hold the hotel in any way responsible for this. 
If staff volunteer to get the manager to speak to you then it should happen or at least a reason given as to why it didnt !!...
It funny it's the small things that stick in your mind and can make all the difference.",4,2009,11,29
211,"Clean, modern, well priced Dublin hotel","We stayed in The Croke Park Hotel from Friday afternoon until lunchtime Sunday and would certainly recommend this hotel to anybody visiting Dublin on either business or pleasure.  By booking through Travelzoo we took advantage of a special offer being promoted which gave us two nights accommodation for two people for 150 euro.  This included bed and full Irish breakfast, one complimentary drink from the bar each on arrival, and 15% discount on further food and beverages purchased.  It also gave us a free upgrade to an executive room which meant that we could use the executive lounge that served complimentary freshly squeezed orange juice and tea and coffee all day.

The rooms in the hotel were bright, modern, spacious and spotlessly clean and the staff were professional, efficient and polite but not particularly friendly (I only came across two Irish members of staff and the rest appeared to be non Irish).

The breakfast was buffet style and although not particularly impressive taste wise, there 
was a reasonable selection and it still represented good value for money for what we paid.

The cab from the airport cost 20 euro approx and a cab into the centre of Dublin eg Temple Bar cost 10 euro each way.

The one negative I will give, and in fairness it is not about the hotel, but about Dublin itself is that it is very, very expensive  (partly due to the weak pound against the euro).

To give an idea of prices, whichever pub we went into a round of drinks consisting of 2 x pints of Guinness, 1 x glass of wine and 1 x measure of Baileys would come to 25 euro eg nearly £25 sterling!  That’s about £10 sterling more than you would pay in the UK!

So to summarize, yes, great hotel (and next door to Croke Park stadium) but take plenty of euro with you!!",4,2009,11,26
211,well worth the visit,First thing to say is what a clean bedroom the housekeeping staff do a excellent job and the room has everything you need for your stay the bathroom is huge and a big tv i cant find anything to complain about except  we were so happy that it was so quite no noise which is nice to say when you are staying in the city.If i had to say anything bad i would have to say location.The staff were very helpful as well and breakfast was 10 out 10 a great choice,5,2009,11,25
211,Great hotel with great staff,"We spent a night at the Croke Park Hotel in November after I had spent a night there in August and been impressed with the value for money. The second time around was no disappointment either. We arrived late, were given a complimentary upgrade to an executive room and the gentleman on reception was pleasant friendly and able to offer advice on the best way to get to my meeting the following morning. The room was nicely done, simple elegant decor , everything one needed and I liked having a shower and bath in my room. The bed really comfortable and we enjoyed the good quality linens. We had dinner in the Bistro and the food was great - well cooked traditional/simple food. My only negative comment there is I think it was slightly expensive, but, the staff were very attentive and it was a lovely atmosphere. Having complimentary parking was such a help as I simply left my car and took a taxi to my meeting the next morning. I think what impresses me most about this hotel is that they have managed to keep their prices reasonable without compromising on the quality of their rooms / beds / hotel decor etc. The decor is modern and the rooms and hotel are always spotless. I will be making this my preferred Dublin Hotel for all my future visits.",5,2009,11,18
211,"Great, chic hotel... but in a gritty outer-city area","Stayed at the Croke Park hotel for one night to attend a concert at the O2.  The room was massive and the bathroom was spacious, modern and immaculate.  The common areas were clean and well kept.  A downside was that internet access was only available on a couple of semi-antique computers in the lobby area.  However, it was free.

I suppose the location is great if you are attending an event at the stadium across the street.  But otherwise good luck trying to find a decent pub or restaurant within a short walk.  Croke Park shares a block with a car repair place, a pizza joint and a polluted drainage ditch/creek.  Definitely not the most scenic area.  But the high standards of the hotel help to offset the decidedly gritty environs... somewhat.",4,2009,11,17
211,Fantastic Hotel (Directions given),"We chose this hotel because of the great reviews this hotel have had from tripadvisor. This hotel ticks all the boxes. The hotel is very clean, the staff are super friendly (Sean and Krisnan), employees are very professional and it's all positive. The only negative thing I could say about this hotel is, it's distance to Dublin main town. However, the atmosphere of the hotel compensated the distance. The other good thing about this hotel is it's only 4 years old, so all the things are new.

One thing I notice lack in tripadvisor is the advise for people getting around Dublin from this hotel, therefore, I am going to make sure I put this thoughts down. The best way to go to the hotel from the airport is definitely by taxi, 17 Euro - 20 Euro depending on traffic. From the hotel, if you need to get to the city centre, you have 2 options - Take a taxi down to O'Connel road which is about 7 Euro, or the other option which we took was to walk to Mountjoy Square and take the bus for 1.15 Euro. Just get on any bus and they all pass by O'Connel street. Directions - From the hotel entrance, turn right and walk straight down, pass the traffic light, keep straight ahead (you'll pass a police station on your left as you walk up), keep straight a head. You'll come to another junction, keep walking straight till you come to a park /garden (call Mountjoy Square). There'll be a strech of busses there, get on any buses there and it should take you to O'Connell street (1.15 Euro). It's about a 6-10 minutes walk from the hotel to this bus stop. When you want to return to the hotel, get on to the opposite side of the road where you initially stopped and find look for bus 46A (there's a few buses which goes to Mount joy Square) which says Mountjoy Square.

The best way to travel arounf Ireland is definitely the Hop-on/Hop-off bus. You can get this ticket from the hotel reception (look for Krishnan) 15 Euro for 1 day or 25 Euro for 3 days. I would recommend the 25 Euro for 3 days because it includes a free ride back to the airport (via Airtravel bus) which normally cost 6 Euro each. You can get catch the Airtravel bus from the top of O'Connel street or beside the Tourist Information Centre in the City Centre. There are 3 options getting to the airport:
1st - Taxi 17Euro - 20Euro (dependinf on traffic)
2nd - Airtravel - get a 3 days travel (Hop on/ Hop off) via the hotel reception which includes airport transfers from O'Connel street. Or get a Family pass from the Tourist Information Centre which is 10 Euro (for two adults).
3rd option - Get the normal public transport which cost 2.40Euro each (I think it's bus 19B, just ask around). It's the stop just before the Airtravel bus-stop.

If you are feeling hungry at night, there's a take away/eat in place call the Bamboo (Chinese) within walking distance from the hotel. We went there every night and the food is good. Direction - From the hotel entrance, turn left all the way down until you come to a traffic light, then turn left. All the way down again until you come to another set of traffic lights, you should be able to see the Chinese Bamboo (2nd shop lot), cross the road and it's on the right. On your left about 6 shops down from the Bamboo is a convinience shop. Food is really good there and we eat in every night.

I hope this will help the first timer. Enjoy yourselves in Dublin and you won't regret staying in this hotel. Make sure you look for Sean or Krisnan when you get to reception and they'll look after you very well. This was the first thing I did when i got to the hotel.",5,2009,11,16
211,"excellent value,very comfortable","Just after returning ,stayed in this hotel for proximity to my daughters gaduation.Very pleased with service,no problem checking in,had dinner in restaraunt,great value for money.the main restaurant was not as fancy as you would expect for a 4 star hotel.Very comfortable bed,very modern bedroom,plasma t.v. c.d. player,tea making facility,walk in shower,couldnt have asked for better.Not a sound in hotel so had a great night sleep.would definately use it again and have no hesitation in recomending it.",5,2009,11,15
211,Lazy package - good value,"Great place - walking distance to Dublin centre, good service in the evenings and nice breakfast in the morning. Staff friendly and open to help.",5,2009,11,15
211,Excellent!!!,"Stayed at Croke Park for 3 nights on Stay Lazy package. We booked an executive room as we had 2 small children and required a bigger room. The room had a double and single bed in it and enough room for a cot.

Being on the executuve floor we had access to the executive lounge which was perfect as children could sleep in room and we could relax in lounge. The lounge also has a good complimentary breakfast although with our package we had a full breakfast included at main restaurant. But we had access to juice, coffees, bottled water, tea, fruit and milk etc..all day.  

Breakfasts were excellent and we had dinner 2 out of the 3 nights at the restaurant and both nights our meals were very good. We had the cheescake and banoffie pie for desert but they were not the best we have ever had but adequate. The mains and starters were excellent. 

The staff were friendly and helpful, especially the restaurant staff. 

The hotel did seem to be mainly for business but it was very quiet and relaxing. 

The location wasnt the best as it was a 20min walk into city centre, but we walked everyday with 2 children under 4 years of age and it was fine. A taxi is no problem if you dont want to walk and this type of quality of hotel in the centre will cost much more than the taxi fare I am sure. 

Finding a hotel to satisfy my hygiene standards is quite difficult but this one passed with 100%. Rooms immaculate.

Hotel manager seems to be quite hands on and aware of what happening around him. 

There was free internet access which was handy as we didnt bring our laptop so great to be able to check emails with ease.

If we come to dublin again I will definately book this hotel again.

The best way to get to hotel from airport is by taxi. Our fare to hotel was Eur17 and back to airport was Eur17.50.

The bathroom was spacious with bath and lovely shower. Beds very comfortable. Our room had lovely toiletries including dental pack and shaving pack. 

You will not regret booking this hotel It is superb.",5,2009,11,14
211,Very pleasant stay,I didn't realise this hotel had changed hands. This is the 4th time I've stayed here - my office uses it as a base for our annual conference at the nearby sports facility (!). The staff at reception and in the restaurant are all very helpful - but I didn't meet a single Irish person on the staff.  I was upgraded (not sure why) to the executive floor - the room was the same as any other hotel room. Couldn't fault it but would alert non-Dubliners to the potential dangers of the rougher parts of town nearby.,4,2009,11,14
211,Good standard for the price,"We stayed at the Croke park hotel for an extended weekend in Dublin.

+ The staff! Very friendly and helpful. Applies for both the reception and restaurant/bar staff.
+ The room. VERY clean and good standard. 
+ The bathroom. It was big, very clean and both with shower and bath tube.
+ Free internet connection. Many hotels charge incredible for a connection, ath Croke park hotel it was free!
+ Il barista, with genuine, very tasty coffee

- The door to the room. Unfortunately, the door was very thin so you could hear all the people walking in the hallway. For me it was no problem but I can imagine a lot of people having a problem with it.

For the price it is a very good choice. If you choose the stay lazy package you get a 25€ voucher to the restaurant/bar, full breakfast and late checkout. We were very happy with the hotel!

There is a decent Italian restaurant and winebar just 200m from the hotel, Enoteca Asti. OK food with good Italian wines.",4,2009,11,09
211,Good but could improve on a couple of things,"First of all, let me say the room we got was lovely although the view out the back is a bit depressing so we just didnt bother looking out of the window and concentrated on our room comforts.  We have to agree with other reviews about the staff - they were lovely, friendly and very helpful.  The area is certainly not great but who cares - you know that anyway before you go there.  Now the bad bit.  On the weekend we were there it was a holiday on the Monday, so the hotel was totally full on the Sunday night.  There were kids everywhere - running around out of control, playing in the lifts, making a real mess of the toilets (I assume it was the kids), and at one point we had a couple of them hiding under our chair while we ate dinner in the bar area.  It was so noisy that we ended up taking our drinks after dinner and going up to our room, which put a bit of a damper on the evening as we fancied sitting down at the bar.  Also, the fact that this huge tv screen is projected on the back wall near the bar, didnt help either.  Why not just create a division between that part of the room and the bar area and let adults who want to have a drink in relative peace do so?  Not all of us are there to sit and watch reality tv programmes - a bar area should be a place where you can unwind and enjoy a drink. 
One other thing concerning the bar area - the management should not allow people to take chairs from the room opposite the bar as this made that particular room unusable due to no chairs being in there, but lots of lonely tables scattered around. It looked terrible and should not be allowed in a 4-star hotel.
Re the food - dinner on the Saturday evening was lovely, but not on the Sunday due to the masses of people.  The continental breakfast was very nice though.",3,2009,11,08
211,Probably the cleanest hotel I've ever syayed at!,"Stayed here over a 2 night break to Dublin. I took advantage of a Travelzoo offer which worked out as 75 Euros per night for the room so it was good value. This rate was for 2 persons, 2 full Irish breakfast, a free drink on the night of arrival in the bar, 15% off any food or drinks purchased and a free upgrade to a deluxe room. As we were in a deluxe room it also meant that we had access to the executive lounge where light refreshments – biscuits, sweets, fruits, hot drinks, orange juice and bottled water was available complimentary all day. As all of this was included in the rate we paid we really did get value for money.
The location of the hotel is approx a 15-20 min walk into the town centre. We did the walk there on the first evening and then got the bus back as the concierge had told us that parking was quite expensive. We found this to be true on the Saturday when we drove to a dinner show at the Arlington Hotel and had to pay 9 Euros for just under 3 hours parking. However, as I live in London, it really wasn’t that bad. As we had hired a car and spent most of our time exploring Wicklow – the location of the hotel was not an issue and they offer free, secure car parking. On that note, Glendalough, Bray, Blessington Lakes etc. are stunning – a must see. The other thing about the hotel’s location is that you can avoid the toll charge.
The service at the hotel was nice. We were welcomed warmly with hot towels and told where to find the bar etc. The room was spacious and very clean. Cleanliness of hotels is one of the first things I note and this one was up there with the best of them. The bathroom had a separate bath and shower – another plus in my eyes - and Aveda shower gel, razor and foam, toothbrush and toothpaste etc. There was also a trouser press, iron and board in the room. TV with the usual channels and a CD player. Bathrobe and comfortable slippers – slightly better quality than your usual hotel slippers. If I were being picky the only thing I could fault was the view – a rail track and some buildings.
Breakfast was another plus. There was a wide selection and the pastries were gorgeous. The juices however were all terribly watered down so the only thing we drank was the orange juice. You can also order hot chocolate, lattes etc. Other than breakfast we did not eat at the hotel. We took advantage of our complimentary drink in the bar. It had a nice layout and some very comfortable sofas in front of a massive TV projection.
My husband has also asked me to mention the free in room wi fi as it’s something he says not all hotels offer complimentary – he found it a real treat! There was also a free ice dispenser on our floor and an ice bucket provided in the room. On our check out date, we rang 10 minutes before the allotted check out time to ask for a bit longer and they gave us a whole extra hour.
The only thing that slightly disappointed me (but not majorly) was that the website stated there was a turn down service in the evening and hot water bottles – none of which we received. But I didn’t actually make mention of it to stay as it wasn’t a major deal for me.
All in all we had a great stay at this hotel. I would definitely recommend it and would not hesitate to stay here again.",5,2009,10,29
211,excellent service,"Stayed two nights at hotel for birthday, Hotel staff very welcoming. Gift of chocolates, champagne and birthday card from hotel was very kind and greatly appreciated. Rooms are lovely with lots of small extras..cd player, avenda toiletries, hairdryer, tea/coffee making facilities.Free car parking also a bonus. Hotel spotless, rooms comfortable, spacious and very clean. Bar area is great with large comfortable sofas. Easy access to Dublin City. Approx 12 euro in taxi one way or 15 minute walk. Had a great time time here and would highly recommend hotel. Worth the walk to the city. Have stayed in sister hotel in Boston and this one beats it hands down!!Big thank you again especially to Anne Marie.",4,2009,10,26
211,"Thoughtful hospitality - personality, precision and professionlism","I stayed at the Croke Park Hotel for business purpose and found it delivered on everything I needed - and on areas that I didn't know I needed such as a lavender hottie in my bed on a cold, rainy night! The staff are very friendly and professional and management is clearly and consistently visible and involved in the service because they care about it - and it shows.
Would happily recommend to anyone who wants to experience Irish hospitality at its best..

211,"A fantastic hotel, great attention to detail and great value for money","My husband and I stayed at Jurys Croke Park from 25-27 September 2009 and had the most brilliant time.  On arrival, I asked if we could have a room overlooking Croke Park Stadium and this was instantly arranged with no problem with no extra cost.  The room was so clean and comfortable and finished to an exceptionally high standard.  The food and service were second to none and from arrival to departure our every need was taken care of by Sean at Reception who was very pleasant, meticulous in detail and clearly dedicated to his job and it speaks volumes.  The hotel is situated very close to Dublin City Centre and extremely easy to find.  We could not find fault at all with our stay and very much look forward to returning again soon.  We stayed on a dinner, bed and breakfast package which was great value for money.  We would highly recommend a stay at this hotel at anytime.

211,Predominantly good stay with all issues resolved,"We had an overall pleasant stay at this property.  There were a few downfalls, hence the four and not five star rating; however, all problems that we did have were resolved.

Almost the entire staff that I encountered was extremely friendly.  The hotel was nicely appointed and the rooms were also nicely appointed and very comfortable.  The beds are very plush and the bedrooms and bathrooms spacious and well worth the money paid.  

We had a fourth floor room with access to the executive lounge.  There was always coffee and tea available.  There were light snacks throughout the day and a continental style breakfast available in the morning.

There were two issues that we had.  We did have an electrical problem with a converter that we plugged in.  Although this issue was resolved, we unfortunately had to deal with a rather rude night manager.  

The other issue was some false advertising on the website, with many amenities listed that are not available or were not available to us during our stay.  These include hot towel service, turndown service, a relaxation chair in our room, slippers in the room, and a few other amenities.  

Now, it is very important to note, that when I did mention the above inaccuracies, one of the hotel managers Alan, apologized for the inaccuracies and promised to correct the website as soon as possible.   In addition, he noted the issue we had with the night manager.

All in all, I would rate this hotel a four out of five.  Kudos to the staff for taking care of the issues that we did have.  I would recommend this hotel again, as I feel that my issues were resolved and will not happen to future guests.",4,2009,10,05
211,Fantastic stay for my birthday,"What can I say we arrived at the hotel is was lovely very nice interior. But a long walk into town and our room wasn't a great view. But with it been my birthday we good upgraded to a suite the staff where fantastic, service the best in any hotel I have been in around the world. We got advised to go to The Church by staff for the 250th anniversary of Guinness and end up getting free tickets to see Kasabian they out of this world.
Our deal included dinner in the bistro for my birthday night,food great even gave us a bottle of wine for my birthday. Breakfast really nice even got a choice of coffee's I had a latte. The hotel I can not fault as good as any I have been to. Staff so helpful, nice touches warm towels to refresh when you arrive and bottle of water when you leave.
The hotel is a little walk 15-20 mins to center but well worth it a great birthday stay and a bit thank you to the staff for making my stay with the hotel special. Have already recommended to some of my fiends. Faultless.",5,2009,10,02
211,"Great Hotel, Great Service - Would recommend to anyone!","This is definitely one of the best hotels I have stayed in.  From the moment you walk in the staff are very eager to help.
We stayed for 2 nights, there was a game at Croke Park the day after our last night, we had read to avoid the hotel when there is a game on, but it didn’t really bother us. 

We arrived early and was allowed to check in at 12pm. We were on the 4th floor and had access to the executive suite where we enjoyed hot drinks, fruit etc. 

Rooms are of a very high quality and the staff are very friendly. Breakfast is one of the best buffet breakfasts I've had! 

One slight downfall was the hotel restaurant, slightly disappointed with the quality of the food. 
Location is OK - it is quite a walk into the town centre a good 20 minutes brisk walk. 

All in all, I would definitely stay here again.",5,2009,09,29
211,Excellent Hotel,"My husband and I recently spent 4 nights at the Croke Park Hotel in Dublin.  We were fortunate enough in our package to have a free upgrade to a Deluxe Room on the 4th Floor.  The room was lovely and clean, quite spacious and beautifully appointed with everything we could possibly need.  The added bonus on the 4th floor was access to the Executive lounge so we could relax and help ourselves to Tea and Coffee after spending the day walking around Dublin.  

We also had a choice of having our breakfast in the Executive Lounge, however, beware of American Airlines crew who obviously stay there quite frequently.  They do tend to take over the Lounge and it's a bit of a ""bun fight"" to get to the buffet!

Part of our package was 15% discount on our meals and drinks in the Hotel Restaurant.  Although the menu was not that extensive - we did find that it worked out quite reasonable.  Our package also included a full Irish Breakfast which was fantastic and the choice was excellent.  It's always nice to have the breakfast kept hot also.  Nothing seemed to be too much trouble in regards to the staff in the dining area either.

Just be aware that the Hotel is quite a walking distance into the city - about 15-20 minutes.  This didn't worry us as we like to walk.  Also the area did appear quite ""dodgy"" - so be vigilant if walking at night and don't venture down any alleys!

Dublin City has alot to offer - however - we decided to venture out to the countryside also as we had time.  Strongly recommend taking The Dart train (10 euros for a day pass for 2 adults - excellent value).  We took the train from Connolly Station (walking distance from Hotel) north to Howth - which is a lovely seaside village with great seafood restaurants.  Then to Malahide to see the Malahide Castle.  Then went all the way south to Bray, Killiney and Dalkey.  You can also get to Enniskerry by bus (about 2.50 Euros) and walk up to Powerscourt in the Wicklow Mountains.....the Estate and the view is well worth it.  It's a bit uphill and takes about 30 minutes.  Much cheaper than taking a tour!!  This was all recommended by the friendly staff and Concierge at the Hotel.

In summary we really enjoyed our stay at The Croke Park Hotel and would strongly recommend this Hotel to anyone visiting Dublin.",5,2009,09,27
211,An Excellent Hotel to stay at.,"We stayed at the Croke Park Hotel when we arrived in Dublin from Canada for a three week Vacation  .  It was a lot further from the airport than we thought it was and so we were convinced that we had missed it . A note on the website about how long the drive from the airport should take would be really helpful .

The staff at the hotel were just fabulous and helpful to us , the room was meticulously clean. 

Now a word of warning to all. This hotel is right across the road from a very large stadium , and we are sure that things can get rowdy sometimes. The staff may very well be powerless to do very much about it when you are already there.  We would suggest asking when you are thinking of booking if there is a game on of any sort for the evening that you want to stay .

Also , look for the deals online. We ( my wife and I ) stayed there for 87.00 Euros per night and that included a wonderful breakfast that was second to none.  All in all , stay there for the right price (without a game on) and you will not be disappointed.",5,2009,09,26
211,Horrible customer service,"DO NOT STAY HERE!!! We stayed 1 night in this overpriced hotel for the U2 concert and they charged us for 2 nights. We did not realize until we got our credit card bill in the mail when we returned to Texas. Since then, we have tried to email and call without anyone able to resolve the mistake(only one person ever called us back). Absolutely worst service EVER!!! In addition, when we arrived they said the valet was closed at 4pm and we had to find parking ourselves which was an awful experience.",1,2009,09,21
211,If only all hotels were as good!,"I would not know where to start with my praise of this excellent hotel-it must be the benchmark to which all hotels should aspire! From a superb breakfast including freshly squeezed orange juice and a magnificent hot and cold buffet, super-efficient and courteous staff, wonderful large standard bedroom with every conceivable luxury and deep, luxury quality beds, to the excellent evening meal, this hotel, in a nutshell is quality and excellence in every sphere. On arrival, we were given warm,damp towels to refresh our hands and on departure, small bottles of water for the journey home. This is a large 4* hotel which claims to give you individual attention, which it does in abundance, due to the obviously good management. I have stayed in some 5* hotels which have not been of this high standard. The only minor criticism which was insignificant, is that the hotel could be in a more pleasant location.",5,2009,09,21
211,What a cracker of a hotel,"I knew this hotel is located across the road from Croke Park stadium and would never stay here if there was a big match on next door. However, once you enter the hotel it's a different world -  very welcoming - room was a treat - everything worked - staff were friendly and efficient  - food & drink was fine - breakfast was most comfortable.

Will I stay here again ?       you bet",5,2009,09,20
211,Unbeatable Service Cleanliness & Standards.,I have never felt the need to write a review on a hotel but these guys need a major pat on the back from arrival to departure all the staff were friendly and professional which made our birthday stay extra special. The rooms are fantastic with every attention to detail possible and the food was of the upmost quality. The only down side to this hotel was when we had to say goodbye. We will be back.!,5,2009,09,14
211,Great if you like match day crowds and associated behaviour,"Booked the Croke Park Hotel based on previous reviews. Unfortunately booked on a day where there was a match at the stadium opposite. The hotel then turns into a drinking place for fans. The bar and outdoor areas had the tvs turned up extremely loudly, most of the tables were not cleared of glasses and empty bottles, and pints were served in plastic. Also watch out for hens nights and party crowds. Was woken at 2am by a group of girls running up and down the hallway talking loudly and slamming doors. This went on for nearly 3 hours despite reporting this to management. The rooms were very spacious and bathrooms well equipped. Water pressure  seemed a problem in the morning at what  was probably the peak time. Internet was complimentary. Mini bar was also still full of previous guests food. Reception and lobby area on non-match days was comfortable and relaxing. The hotel itself is not in the best location, but it wasn't too far to walk to the main road to get a bus into the city centre. For the price I paid, it was an ok stay, but I think I would look elsewhere next time, especially if there is a game scheduled during the stay. And please, please, please can you install some foam or something on doors in the hotel. There was the constant noise of slamming doors throughout the day and night.",3,2009,09,13
211,fantastic place to stay,"This hotel is one of the best that we have stayed in.  Bedroom kept immaculate and what comfy beds.  Bathroom is large with all the extra amenities you could hope for.  Breakfast was excellent on both mornings - good selection of food, and staff could not do enough for you.  All public rooms were kept spotless, and the gym was very well equipped, just sorry that I did not have time to use it during our stay - maybe next time!
On arrival we were given hot cloths to freshen up, and on departure was presented with a bottle of water each.
Overall the staff were all so pleasant, and this certainly was appreciated by ourselves, and made our stay a most memorable one.
Keep up the high standards.",5,2009,09,06
211,Convenient for Croke Park,Atended All Ireland Semi Final between Tyrone and Cork. Hotel was convenient Good value deal.,5,2009,09,02
211,"Fantastic, great value for money, but far from the attractions","The hotel is very clean, the room is spacious, the bed is good, there was a good TV, amenities, a bathtub in the bathroom. The hotel concierge was really good and helpful. There was a computer and a printer we could use in the lobby. They also had a nice bar. The hotel is in front of the Croke Park (where U2 played at the end of the month of July 2009), so I guess it’s good to check if there is a big game or event at the time of your visit. The neighborhood is quiet and apparently safe, but you have to be willing to walk if you want to get to the city center. It is about 30 minutes walking to get to the attractions. Near the hotel there aren’t restaurants or grocery shops. The hotel is about 15 minutes by taxi to the port (we got to Dublin by ferryboat) and about 10 minutes walking to the bus station. 
The price was amazing, we paid 56 euros a day in July. All the other places we searched when we booking hotels were more expensive. 
If you don’t mind walking, it’s a great value for money",5,2009,08,29

Then next night I asked for a taxi for the following morning and a wake up call and received both.  Didn't eat here as we were out and about each day.  It is within walking distance to O'Connell St. and beyond.",5,2009,08,28
211,absolutely sublime,"cleanliness - you could eat your dinner off the floor! 
location - only a 15 minute walk to ""temple bar"". If you can't do this; stop eating too much and exercise more!
rooms - so sublime you don't want to leave it!

My wife & I were on the executive fourth floor & ""wahey""; no I mean ""WAHEY"", these rooms open yours eyes wide & drops your chin!
If you don't fancy a cooked breakfast, go for the continental one in the executive lounge; the best meal I had!

211,"Location, location, location - very very dubious.","Top marks to the Hotel , first class in every respect.  
This hotel is great value for money.and the Management and staff deserve great praise for their efficient friendly manner..
However the downside is the  area around the hotel,-  it is abominable.  Very run down and sub standard.
Adjacent to the hotel,  beside the canal,  a warning notice proclaims that the area is under surveillance by  security cameras because of the high level of  unacceptable activity ! 

On our first day as  we walked into town,  it was self evident that this was a fairly undesirable area  with some seedy characters lurking about.
 In the evening on our return we felt uneasy and intimidated,- always looking over our shoulders checking things out .

 We don't want to exaggerate the situation but suffice to say  when dropping us off at the hotel our taxi driver  initially questioned us as to why we did not stay at the Jury's hotel in town, rather in this  area !
In addition when we were walking back one night,  we were greeted by a friendly (harmless) drunk , who welcomed us to Dublin and repeatedly kept telling us in his wonderful  Irish brogue to  ' watch yerselfs now '.      
 A fine, decent fellow indeed and so reassuring.!

To us it seemed that Dublin is a city of two halfs and the best half is definitely  at the end of Oconnoll Street over the Liffey Bridge, with much better restaurants, shops and hotels. 
There are some very entertaining street buskers in this area who provide amazing entertainment, - for a small donation.

Because of the many good reports in T.A.,  we headed for Ryan's  Irish Pub opposite the  information centre.  We had one good meal and one fairly indifferent meal of very fatty / grisly  roast beef and stodgy potatoes.
 We found many good , healthy options , further around the corner behind the info centre.  In fairness maybe we hit a bad day.
Incidentally they open at  12.30 on a Sunday,  not 12.00, - which is weekday opening time.

What did we think of Dublin ?
First and foremost,  the Irish are lovely people, very helpful and pleasant at all times.
Unfortunately everything in Dublin is very, very expensive.
The cost must be horrendous for a family having to eat out. 
There is little point shopping  here when everything can be bought so much cheaper in the U.K.

Would we go back? 
Yes, we would.
Despite some of our misgivings, there is something magnetic , almost irresistible about the City.
Maybe it's the black stuff,- I'm a convert now , creamy delicious,nourishing and alcoholic!!

P.S. Don't miss a visit to the Guinness Storehouse, it's brilliant, - especially the Irish band and dancers after the factory tour , - not to mention the pint you pull yourself.",4,2009,08,24
211,excellent value for money,"Room excellent, wins best bed award for our trip to Ireland - v comfy.  Bathroom so clean it looked new and unused. Restaurant and bar area spacious and attractive and food was good too. Staff friendly and efficient. Good parking.",5,2009,08,21
211,"Very nice hotel, great value","My wife and I stayed in the Croke Park hotel on the first 2 nights of our honeymoon trip to Ireland.  
We were pleased to discover that parking was free, and check in was very fast.  The rooms were clean and well stocked with an LCD TV, a stereo, and a desk with wired internet (internet cable included).  The bathroom was very clean and modern, including a shower that was among the best I have ever seen in a hotel.  All of this was for a very reasonable $200 Canadian (for both nights).
The location was fine, since a walk to the centre of town was only about 20 minutes each way, and it was a very pleasant and scenic trip.  Once downtown, walking was absolutely the way to go - whenever possible in Dublin, leave the car behind!
The view was not that interesting however, but across the street is the Croke Park stadium, if you are interested in catching a hurling match (which we were not fortunate enough to see).
The only negative - the elevator is very annoying, with its audio announcement of every action: ""door opening, door closing, second floor, door opening...""",4,2009,08,18
211,Outstanding Value & people,Got a great value deal for a superior room on the internet.,5,2009,08,14
211,Very Convenient/Great Hotel For Croke Park Events...,"Stayed here from July 23rd through July 28th. Super convenient for attending the 3 U2 concerts at Croke Park. The room was ready when we arrived very early (around 830-900am). Room was nice and clean. Hotel was very nice and front desk staff was very nice and attending to all of our requests. The hotel was very crowded (as expected) after each of the shows, but it is definitely a real plus not having to trek back to a hotel after a show with 80,000+. However, the amount of people did not effect our sleeping or room noise (we were on the 3rd floor with a window to the inside courtyard).

Since on north side, closer to the airport. 

Only drawback is that it is far away from city center. It is about a 20+ minute walk down to the River Liffey. You can hop on a bus over on Lower Drumcondra though. A taxi ride will probably cost you about 10Euro.",5,2009,08,11
211,Sheer luxury - pity about the location,"Very friendly staff. Warm towel to refresh on arrival. The bed was like heaven, pure luxury, words cannot do that bed justice. Lovely flat screen tv, music centre and fully stocked mini-bar in room. You could check how much your bill was on the tv! To my shock my phone call was very expensive! When I stayed there they didnt have wireless broadband in the rooms but there was wifi in the lobby.",5,2009,08,10
211,The Best Hotel Ever,"Well the headline says it all. From the start to the finish this hotel is the best.

The check-in is so easy and simple and the warm fresh towel was a nice touch. We were into the room within 5 mins and the twin room was 2 nice and comfortable double beds and a spacious room. Everything in the room was faultless.

The restaurant does not have the largest selection but if you do eat there you will find top quality food at reasonable prices. I had fillet of sea bream which was the freshest and best cooked piece of fish i have ever had.

Every detail in this hotel is looked after from the rooms to the food to the staff. Any questions i had were met with a warm and friendly staff member on hand to help.

If you want some where in Dublin then go to the Croke Park. Don't let the cheap price let you think you are staying in a sub standard hotel. This standard of this hotel is way above the price level. 

I would say this hotel is 5 star hotel in the way it is run by its staff.",5,2009,08,08
211,Nice Hotel,"Walking in the Lobby of the hotel is very modern and furniture with clean lines that lead to the reception. The rooms are nice and comfortable. Very cozy bed. The bathroom was very clean with separate shower and tub which if you wanted to take a nice soak in they give you bath salts.The room also has a hot pot, safe, blow dryer, flat screen tv, music system you can play your cd's on. The hotle has free w-ifi internet in your room or if you wish you may use the computer downstairs. The gym is very clean and nice. There are 2 treadmills, 1 bike, 1 stair master, 1elliptical,lap pulldown, chest press, a few free weights and some core balls.",5,2009,08,07
211,Lovely hotel,"Stayed here for 2 nights in June- - got great deal through Supervalue Breaks. Room was very nice, spacious and clean - view not so great...dirty canal. The reception was very good, we were handed warm towels on arrival, and giving bottled water on departure. We dined in the dining room the first night, service was good, but they hadn't the wine or the starter i requested. Food was fine but not of 4* standard. On the 2nd night we ate in the bar, food was lovely. All in all for what we paid (€79 per room per night), it was well worth it. Would stay again.",4,2009,08,05
211,"great value,staff exceptionally friendly and helpful,rooms fantastic and in short a hotel of excellence.","Back from a holiday in france we arrived on the 14th july and what a surprise.The old style natural friendly helpful service is still here. The staff were excellent, aware of your needs especially in the dining room at both breakfast &dinner servings. .                                                              Warm friendly smile  with no delays at reception,nice touch with the refreshing warm face&hand towel after journey. 
The bedroom and bathroom were plenty size with great facilities:tea making, hairdrier,tv
etc including free access internet connection.Great choice of food for breakfast and nicely surprised at both the presentation and lovely taste of our 4 course dinner.
No amenities beside hotel but 10 minute taxi ride for 5 euro takes you to city centre.
Extra bonus carpark is free .Brilliant value and yes we will definitely be back again.",5,2009,08,04
211,Excellent rooms - luxurious and tastefully decorated ....,"The rooms were nice, the breakfast was sumptuous, the staff were friendly.
Location was not in the heart of the action ie. it is about a 20 minute walk to Trinity College, St Stephen's Green, Christ Church etc. That said the price was good - we ate breakfast outside on some days and at the hotel on some of the days. A bit cheaper outside - but the breakfast at the hotel was a hearty Irish breakfast that left one satisfied.",5,2009,08,01
211,good hotel at a poor location,"Stayed overnight in an executive room, and true: staff is very friendly and helpfull, rooms are very comfortable. But it should be mentioned that location is really bad. Maybe for Dubliners this is obvious but to all others: Croke Park is not a public garden but a mega concert- and sport stadium and you are right in front of it. There is nothing outside and you need a cab or bus to go downtown. Restaurant and bar have a rather cheap feeling and are not at the same level as the rooms.",4,2009,07,30
211,Great hotel!,"This was an amazing hotel. It was clean & beautiful the staff was terrific (warm towels upon check in). It was a tad far from the city centre but not a bad walk if you stick down the center strip its pretty much a straight shot. We always worked up a great appetite and when we didn't feel like walking the cab ride was less than 8 Euros. Plus from this hotel the cab to the airport was only 20 mins. Everything about the room was fantastic, the TV was great and wonderful for relaxing after a long day of site seeing, the bed was super comfortable and the bathroom was luxurious. We will come back again.",5,2009,07,29
211,A gem in Dublin,"I've stayed here more times than I care to remember, since it opened 4 years ago. Have probably been assigned a room on every floor, just as a note from personal experience the rooms on the ground floor seem to be that bit smaller than upper floors or maybe its just a case of the two that I had been assigned on the two times I was on the ground floor. The nicest thing about the bedrooms has to be the walk in shower.

The fourth floor rooms can tend to be that bit bigger, as they refer to this floor as the executive floor. These rooms are slightly more expensive than the standard room but do come with free wi-fi access. Also with these rooms comes access to the executive lounge on the fourth floor, which is a well laid out private lounge with 'small' balcony facing croke park stadium. When the hotel is busy due to match weekends/event weekends this can be a nice haven/escape as the downstairs bar tends to be busy. You also have access to free juices/waters/papers in the executive lounge along with a free continental breakfast in the executive lounge if you do not have breakfast included in your room rate.

The sideline bar/bistro located on the ground floor is also very comfortable i've eaten/had a drink, both with company/or on my own on a number of occassions and each time was always made to feel welcome by the friendly staff. For the smokers outside the bar is a covered by large parasols internal courtyard. With an area that is turned into a bar on busy weekends. 

The hotel is around 10 mins walk to O'Connell Street / 15 - 20 mins walk to Temple Bar / Grafton Street. A cab to in or around Trinity College works out at around €10.

Within the past year the hotel has become part of the re-branded (from jurys doyle) to The Doyle Collection, and upon a most recent visit I must say they have gone back to the old Jurys day of providing a superior service, from the warm towel upon check-in to the complimentary bottle of water upon check out and everything else in between. I really felt in recent years the Jurys brand had become tired and they had seemed to forget about customer service. 

Finally if you are out late at night in Dublin I highly recommend a cab/taxi back to the hotel as some may find the area to be not to be one of the nicer areas of Dublin late at night. Although in all my years staying here I have never once experienced any trouble in the area, and never deemed my personal security to be at risk.

If you are looking for a nice quiet hotel within walking distance of dublin city centre, I cannot highly recommend the place enough.",5,2009,07,29
211,"First class hotel, luxury in every way superb value.","If you book through an alternative web site pricing, there are some excellent deals. This hotel offers everything you would expect from a luxury hotel for the price of a guest house.
Bar is quite reasonable (by Irish standards) and the food is also good value.
It's about 15 min walk to main area (shopping, pubs ect) A taxi from the airport is 20 Euro's.
Well worth a punt (so to speak)",5,2009,07,24
211,"""a concert hit""","I was headed to a concert in the O2 & availed of the Croke Park Jury's ""O2 special"" pack - a non residential concert offer pack as wary of no parking on site - (also residential option). Complimentary car parking, main course in restaurant, glass of wine, transport to/from venue - all for €19.50. The experience was seamless - everything made easy with all the hassle removed. Great food too.. I went from car to bar to bus with attentive, courteous service at all levels in the hotel. I'll certainly be back. Highly recommended. A huge hit.",5,2009,07,23
211,Very Good - Just not excellent,"After using tripadvisor to book so many hotels and bnb's in the past, i Thought it only fair that I give a little feedback myself. Very clean spacious hotel, rooms were an excellent size, air conditioning and good size bathroom. Although, nothing suburb or out of the ordinary, that would give it the No #3 position of hotels in Dublin. We availed of a special offer which gave a 25euro voucher off drinks or food with breakfast included, and late checkout(In an executive room) for 125 euro. Very good value. If however, you are travelling into the city you have to factor taxi prices into budget as hotel is a bit of a walk to the center. Since im Irish I was a bit disappointed with the bar, as its very square and lacks atmosphere. Excellent beer garden though.
You'll have very little to complain about when you leave the Croke park hotel, so I can see why its got such positive reviews. But for me, theres nothing stand-out-ish about this hotel that would jusify such a good rating for a hotel thats quiet a bit outside the center",4,2009,07,21
211,Everything you could want and MUCH more!!!!,"Booked this hotel through late rooms.com at an excellent rate, for a special occasion.
Arrived early and was allowed to check-in. Greeted with warm hand towels to freshen up!  Had booked a deluxe room but to our pleasant surprise we were upgraded to the Executive 4th floor. This upgrade allowed us entry to the Executive Suite which included complimentary tea, coffee, juice, biscuits and a full continental breakfast, which was to die for.  All staff extremely helpful and polite. Only small downsize was the out of town location, however at most it was a 10-15 minute walk, which for a nice leg stretch at the start and end of each day. Also made use of the complimentary pedal cycles which were very well maintained and appeared nearly new.  Top food in the Bistro and rooms stunning. Highly recommended.",5,2009,07,20
211,Great place to stay,"Stayed 2 nights on the Stay Lazy rate - 105 euros per room per night  for 3 adults, excellent full breakfast included, 25 euro food/drink credit and 2pm checkout. Very nice room (two big double beds) and luxurious bathroom/shower. Room though at back of hotel and slightly disturbed by train noise. Very polite and helpful staff. Very good food (recommend the 3 course menu  for 25 euros) and excellent service, Takes about 20 minutes to walk into town centre. Complementary bikes available. Gym reasonably well equipped. About 20 euros taxi trip from airport (single airport bus ticket is 7 euros). Thoroughly recommend anyone to stay here.",5,2009,07,18
211,Very Nice Hotel!,"Although it's a bit of a walk to the city center, the Croke Park Hotel is an extremely nice hotel with great rates.  Our room was nicely decorated, very comfortable with all necessary amenities.  I would highly recommend it.",4,2009,07,15
211,Very good hotel,"I stayed here for 2 nights and received an excellent rate on lastminute.com. The hotel itself is fairly new and located beside Croke Park. We had a nice comfortable room on the second floor with nice firm bed. Bathroom and bedroom were very clean. Room had LCD TV, mini hifi, safe, mini bar - overall very well appointed. A seperate bath and shower was provided in the bathroom which was nice.

We had breakfast on both mornings in the restaurant and it was excellent. Loads of variety for everyone and the service was the best I have seen in any hotel. We had drinks in the bar on one night - it's not the most comfortable of hotel bars I have been in. Free Underground parking was also provided.

Overall a very well presented hotel. I would have given it 5/5 only for a) uncomfortable bar and b) locality - a bit run down. Getting a taxi to/from hotel, as we did, overcomes the latter issue.",4,2009,07,14
211,"Brilliant Hotel, fantastic service and great rooms","I loved my stay at Croke Park.  If i could afford to move in I would!  From my arrival to my departure i felt well cared for and at home.

The room was a great size with a massive king sized bed that i could have stayed in forever if my office hadn't beckoned!  The bathroom was big with both a bath and seperate shower and lovely smelling toiletries.  The towels were plenty big and soft.

The restaurant food was lovely, i did only have soup and Ceasar Salad but it was delicious.  The breakfast was fantastic, you couldn't have more choice and the toast was freshly made which isn't always the case but seems to be at this hotel.

The reception staff were great, you get given a hot towel to refresh yourself whilst checking in and a bottle of water on departure which in the heat you definately needed.  Taxi's are ordered by reception with your room number as reference so there is no confusion and a quick service.

I travel a lot for work and have stayed in more expensive hotels with a lot less service.

I would recommend this hotel and will be coming back here when i am in Dublin next month with the girls.",5,2009,07,14
211,Total enjoyement,"- Restaurant food is good. Options available for vegetarians also.
- Hotel service is good. Staff is really helpful.
- Rooms are also good",4,2009,07,11
211,First rate!,"This visit was my third to Dublin in the past 7 months. Not really sure why  I picked the Croke Park hotel but I was delighted with my choice. Genuine warm welcome at reception. Superb rooms. Food (breakfast and evening meals) was better than I had anticipated. Four of us had a really good evening meal. Service in the restaurant was warm and friendly. 

Comp' car parking.

OK, it's not 'next door' to O'Connell Street but that will not deter me from booking there again.

One negative, several guests were VERY  loud when using mobile 'phones in the restaurant. Damn things should be banned when guest are eating!

Overall, a really enjoyable stay at a good hotel.",5,2009,07,11
211,Great hotel--worth checking out!,"We had a very good experience at the Croke Park Hotel.
Highlights:
*We were allowed to check in prior to 9 a.m.  We had an overnight flight with a five-year-old, so this was huge.
*We were upgraded  for free to the executive floor.  This allowed us to get tea, coffee, milk and (packaged) cookies for free.  We were also able to get a light breakfast every day.  There was a nice seating area.
*We were always professionally and politely greeted.  It was VERY clear that customer service is extremely important to this hotel.  If you did have a problem at this hotel, I would be shocked if it wasn't quickly taken care of.  I mentioned at the front desk that I selected this hotel because they were number three on trip advisor--and they told me they had just bumped to number two that morning.  (I think they have moved back to three.)  But, this tells me they pay attention to the reviews they get!
*The rooms were clean and safe.

I think the location of this hotel could be a concern for some tourists.  HOWEVER, the front desk can call a taxi anytime  I think even with a couple trips into the city center and back each day--most people would still come out ahead.  (Verses staying at a comparable hotel in the city center.)    If you are willing to walk into the city center--or take a bus a couple of times, you absolutely come out ahead.  PLUS, at least when we stayed--it was absolutely quiet here.  You don't have to deal with street noise at night, which was mentioned as an issue for other hotels.  With a child, it was better for us to stay at a quiet hotel.

I booked directly through the Jury website--and got three nights for the price of two.",5,2009,07,08
211,Far exceeded my expectations!!!,"We just spent 2 nights at the Croke Park and it was great! The service was amazing and the value was unbeatable! We took the executive room ($109 E) and the extras were more than I ever imagined. At check in we received warm towels to freshen up with, then went directly to our room which was large and very comfortable. We received a complimentary drink every day, either in our room, the executive lounge or the bar, cozy bath robes, every imaginable bath/spa item in the bathroom, a free movie rental, free parking and free breakfast every morning in the executive lounge which included juices, coffee, teas, meats, cheese, yogurt etc. We had lunch and dinner at the hotel and both the meals and the service were fantastic. The staff were great with helping with directions and the 15-20 minute walk to the downtown core was a great way to start and end the day. I would most definitely recommend this hotel to anyone heading to Dublin. I have done a fair bit of travelling and even compared to Canadian standards, the Croke Park is the best value I have encountered!!",4,2009,07,05
211,Fabulous,"Would recommend this hotel to anyone, staff were super efficient, friendly and couldn't do enough to help you. We really enjoyed the three nights we spent here. The rooms are the cleanest I've seen in any hotel and with great facilities. Breakfast was delicious and had a great selection. I can't find any fault, about 15mins walk to city centre and has free parking so it really is a hidden gem",5,2009,07,01
211,Great Hotel & Fantastic Staff,"I have stayed at  the Croke Park Hotel for 2 years (Business) The bedrooms & bathrooms are large, comfortable and very clean. The food is great with a decent choice in both the Restaurant & Bar but without doubt the most valuable thing for me has been the staff, they are always courteous, polite and friendly they are Croke Park's biggest asset.",5,2009,06,26
211,This is quite simply the best hotel I've EVER stayed in!!!!,"I have stayed at Jurys Croke Park twice now - both times have been fantastic! The two times I was there I travelled with my other half and my parents, both times the hotel was VERY busy as there were sporting events going on at the stadium (literally a 30 second walk away - across the road) but both times I thoroughly enjoyed myself. The staff are amazing, so polite and professional (but friendly at the same time) - coming from a hotel background myself I know what could go wrong or the things that can be forgotten when the hotel is busy (the residents are normally pushed to the side and forgotten about) but we were looked after so well from arrival through to departure.

The food is great, my personal favourite is the breakfast, it's fresh and delicious - I could eat it every day and never get fed up of it (although I would get fat!!!). The bar food is never a disappointment - it's tasty and the choice is fabulous! 

I think the thing that really impressed me was the staff - they can never do enough to help and you never feel that you're asking for too much - JUST PERFECT!

I would definatly recommend this hotel to all - whether you are a singleton, couple, family or group - you will NOT be disappointed in any way when you stay here.

Can't wait to go again!!!",5,2009,06,26
211,"Excellent location, beautiful rooms, great restaurant, friendly staff","We had a lovely stay here...our last night traveling after being gone for a month. I must say, this was certainly one of the nicer places we stayed at. The room itself was very comfortable, great bathroom, incredibly helpful staff, good food, nice to have 2 computers available with internet. We had a very enjoyable stay.",5,2009,06,19
211,absolutley great- would stay again and reccomend,"I'm a fussy person - so take that into account when you read this review.
This hotel is well situated ( 25 min walk/ 10 min drive) to Dublin centre , with free parking .
The interior was pleasent ,clean and modern , and this sentiment is echoed for the staff , room , service . Check  in was swift and friendly, the room was good sized and clean with good channels on the TV , room service was prompt but expensive ( im a cheap person, so it's not really a critism , but you have to add 5 euros onto anything brought up to the room). This meant that the full irish brekkie was 21 euros!
The bed was the best bed Ive slept in for a while at a hotel ,  Free internet in room as well ( wired connection)

All in all A great hotel 
thanks to all the staff there",5,2009,06,11
211,it was the most memorable weekend of my life,"my daughter and i stayed in the croke park hotel on saturday the 14th of feb 2009 because my brother was playing in the all-ireland AIB football final on the 14th, saturday.We checked in at 2pm aprox. left our luggage in our room, had a lovely lunch and headed to the city centre for a bit of shopping before the game.we arrived back at around 4.30 pm to welcome our team st. michaels of galway and the supporters had a chat and a laugh, then proceeded to the game in croker, just a few seconds walk away. when the national anthem was played and my brother and his team standing for their very first time in croke park , everyone had a tear in their eye, it was the most uplifting and emotional and proud night in our lives, we will never forget. eventhough we didn't win the final, our spirits were high, afterwards we headed back to the hotel, and had the best night ever, and the room service was fantastic, my daughter and i had a beautiful meal. and the breakfast in the early hours of the morning was superb, so thank you all again for a most memorable experience, never to be forgotten, mise le meas, bernie stewart-qadri, gaillimh.",5,2009,06,03
211,Delighful Staff - Terrific Hotel,"Stayed here 1 night with my husband.

We loved this hotel - it had very polite and helpful staff, a very nice room (spacious, clean and comfortable) - and secure parking.

We were fine with the location - quite  a pleasant walk into town.

We would stay here again in a flash",5,2009,06,01
211,Absolute Excellence,"I stayed in the Croke Park Hotel with my mother last week (May 09).  It was absolutely fantastic from the minute we went in the car park door.  Theres free parking for hotel guests, which in Dublin city centre is very rare!!!  We were greeted with nothing but help and kindness from the moment we entered the hotel.  The staff are extremely friendly and cannot do enough to help.  We had upgraded to the business package, which meant access to the business lounge, which was 24 hr complimetary tea, coffee, etc., had fresh fruit, biscuits, etc.  on offer.  There was also a continental breakfast in the lounge which was gorgeous, fresh pastries, chesses, cured meats, etc.  
We ate in the hotel restaurant on the first night and had a friend joining us, which in some hotels can cause a problem but this like evrything else was delt with very professionally.  The food and drinks manager Eoghan was superb.   
Overall I would give it 10/10, and recommend anyone to stay there, I will most definately be staying again!!",5,2009,05,26
211,"Very nice hotel, excellent quality for the price","This hotel is very nice, the rooms are pretty upscale for the price, we paid 60 Euros / 88 American for the room.  The rooms we a little small by American Standards, but very well appointed, Flatscreen TVs, stereo with CD Player, Comfortable beds,  The bathrooms were really large with a tub and shower (tub is pretty narrow)  Good water pressure, the bathroom was spotless and gleaming.   It is a good 10 min walk to the touristy stuff, but its located in a pretty quiet area so you don't have all of the street noise that I imagine you would get in City Center.",5,2009,05,26
211,Croke Park Hotel Scores Another GOAL!!!,"Last weekend we stayed in the Croke Park hotel for the second time within a year and once again it didnt fail to deliver. We stayed in one of the Superior Rooms (1 Double and 1 Single Bed ) for €116 on a stay lazy deal which their website was offering: STAY LAZY! Rate includes full breakfast, 2pm late check out, Tax and €25 free hotel bar / restaurant credit (per stay). We didnt use the €25 credit at the bar / restaurant however which we should have but maybe next time :-)

The hotel is situated on the North side of the city only a few minutes off the M1 which suited us much better as we didnt have to drive through the city centre. We drove directly to the free onsite underground car park which was handy.

It is a nice walk into town - but a pleasant one. We walked into town from the hotel shortly after arrival and done a bit of shopping and had food in the city centre.

The rooms are bright and contemporary. A nice flat screen is positioned nicely at the end of the bed along with an entertainment system below it. The bathroom was very nice too - with a walk in shower and seperate bath area; towels and supplies were in plentiful supply too - oh and the hair dryer was efficient too for a change.

We had the breakfast the next morning which we found to be very good. There was a good range of fruits, cereals and hot food so we certainly filled up and made good use of the buffet breakfast. The service was 100% - very quick and made us feel very welcome. 

So once again I cant recommend this hotel enough. And will stay again... :-)",5,2009,05,26
211,Expensive,"We had intended to use B&B accommodations in Dublin, but due to our late arrival we had to opt for a hotel. The Hotel was busy but had rooms available, a bit on the expensive side but as we felt our choice was limited at the late hour, we stayed.
Our rooms were clean and well appointed and breakfast the next morning was the standard irish style. Over all we enjoyed our  trip to Dublin and Northern Ireland, Belfast  Derry and Portrush.",4,2009,05,20
211,"Excellent Choice, but a bit of hike to the downtown","I stayed in this hotel based on the other reviews in Tripadvisor and the rate on the Doyle's web site.  The hotel is modern and spacious.  Our room was as big as a typical American hotel and much bigger than most European hotels. The room was outfitted in a pretty minimal way, efficient, but not luxurious.  The staff, especially Stephen the concierge was superb. He gave us great advice. Internet connections were available throughout the hotel, including the lounge, where my son liked to work late, near the fireplace.  Beds were firm but comfortable in our twin room. Breakfast was very good standard fare.  Service was quick and friendly.  
There is a free business center for guests, which I used to print a boarding pass.

The only downside is the distance from the city center and the surrounding neighborhood. The hotel is next to a large sports stadium used for football and other sports.  The neighborhood is a little rough around the edges, although we always felt safe.  There is free parking though at the hotel.  It was a 25 minute walk to the other side of the river. The cab driver told us on the way from the airport that we needed to be on the other side of the river to see the tourist sites such as the Guiness Store House, Dublin Castle, Christ Church, etc.  There is a lot of shopping  on the hotel side of the river.  Walking back at night from Temple Bar is something I would think twice about, although it is a short and prices taxi ride.

I would stay at the Croke Park if I had a car and didn't plan to do a lot of walking tours through Dublin.   Unless you like to walk a lot, I would look for another place on the opposite side of the Liffey River.",4,2009,05,17
211,Five star quality for three star price,"We picked Croke Park Hotel based on TripAdvisor reviews, and as usual the hotel was as described by other reviewers.  It appears to have been recently renovated and everything was new and very clean and cosy.  We always check the kettles to see if there is mold and rust and the kettles were spotless (as an example).  The bathrooms were large and bright and again very clean.  We were on the side of the hotel that is next to some rail tracks but we only heard the trains after 8:00-8:30 a.m. and they were relatively quiet.  There is free parking and internet which was very convenient for us.  Also the hotel is directly across from the Croke Park stadium so if you are interested in touring the stadium (apparently, in addition to football, they have Gaelic sports) you can just walk across and you can get a discount if you show your hotel room key. 

The only drawbacks are 1) distance to city centre and 2) no breakfast included.  Cab rides to Temple Bar area are around 10 to 15 euro one way. The breakfast was an additional 14 euro per person, which is a little excessive.  There was no a la carte menu.  Otherwise we got a great rate on the room.",5,2009,05,15
211,Fantastic Stay at Jury's Croke Park Hotel & will def return!!!!,"We have just returned from a 2 night stay at the Jury's Croke Park and it was brilliant!  Check in was very swift and friendly and we were given hot flannels to freshen up with and everything was explained to us and pointed out once they knew we'd never stayed before.  Our room was lovely, very big and clean with a king size very comfy bed.  We didn't have breakfast as we walked into the centre to find somewhere else (no fault on the hotel's food or prices but we never eat in the hotels we stay at).  It took about 15 mins to walk to O'Connell Street which was very quiet and pleasant but we did get taxi's back in the evening which cost about 11 euros.  Check out as well was swift and friendly and we were given small bottles of chilled water to take away with us - the little touches like this were brilliant.  All in all a brilliant stay and we will def be going back for longer ASAP.  Dublin itself was fab too and well recommended, we brought Dublin Passes and 3 day frredom travel tickets before we got there so the attractions (Guinness Brewery, jameson's Distikllery, Croke Park, Bus Tour - that's all we ahd time for) were then paid for as was all travel.  To get to the hotel from the airport get the 16a bus and ask the bus driver to shout you for the stop by Croke Park.  We got a taxi to the airport for our return journey as we decided last minute to visit Croke Park Stadium and this cost approx 20 euros.",5,2009,05,13
211,Hotel superb - staff even better,I stayed here with a group of friends who had just cycled from Belfast. On arrival we were informed there was a problem with the booking - but this was quickly corrected and sorted by the duty manager Eoin who couldn't have been nicer - he sorted out some complimentary sandwiches for us and was an absolute gent. Hotel was lovely - clean and luxurious. Sinead was great for clear and concise communication in the lead up to the booking and Patricia was very helpful in finalising our bill. Would definitely stay here again in what is a four start hotel with 3 star prices.,5,2009,04,28
211,Great Hotel :) would go back!,"Me and a girlfriend (19 and 20) of mine have just returned from the Jurys Croke Park after a recent weekend stay and had the best time ever.

The Rooms
The rooms were lovely and spacious, although we did pay the extra to have a double bed each :) they were amazing! There was a TV with some sky channels inc setanta sports and 3 sky sports channels, a modern music system, hairdryer, iron and board, trouser press, tea and coffee making facilities etc - all the usual things too. The bathroom was huge for a hotel...separate shower cubicle and bath. Everything in the rooms were to a high standard and kept very clean indeed. Towels changed daily. However there are no ""views"" out of any of the rooms really as one side you have Croke Park stadium, the other a train line (didn't see one train!) and the other houses although this didn't bother us in the slightest.

The Hotel
Well maintained through out, kept very clean and the staff couldn't do enough for you. The lobby was very spacious and comfortable, and so did the restaurant and bar (however we didn't use either). The corridors were very quiet at night, and with black out blinds and curtains we slept very well indeed. There were also ice and water machines in the corridors on each level which was a nice touch. There was free wi-fi in the hotel, and for those without laptops, there were 2 computers in the lobby that you could use -  all for free. The hotel's gym looked very plush indeed - again though we didn't quite get a chance to use it. Staff were excellent and the security was great - at night after 12 you were met at the entrance by a porter who would take your room number and confirm you were a guest before being allowed in.

The Location
Directly next to Croke Park it would be fantastic for anyone attending anything there. We flew into Dublin airport, and found it easy getting to the hotel by bus; 16a or 41. Get off at Drumcondra and it's about a 5minute walk to the hotel. The hotel was around a 20minute walk to the centre of Dublin (15mins to the top O'Connell Street but to get to the south side of the river and Temple Bar maybe 25-30 mins). However it was a nice walk and we did it every day and night. Even though we were two girls on our own, we walked home after a night out in the early hours and did feel very safe. 

Dublin
A bit about Dublin. It is pretty expensive! Drinks... expect to pay between 5-6euros for a pint of beer/cider which with how the exchange rate is at the moment is around £5-£6. Food also is expensive compared with England and as students in England we found it very steep. We went to Dublin Zoo which was great, the Guiness Storehouse which you HAVE to do and Trinity College. Also did many other of the free sites like the National Gallery and Museum. They have some great shopping areas too just off of O'Connell Street which were also very expensive compared to the UK right now. 

Nightlife
The nightlife was probably as you'd imagine... busy! The best place to go for a traditional Irish music night we found was the Temple Bar area. Had some fab little pubs which on a Saturday night were jam packed. A lot of Stag and Hen parties around and drunk English tourists in this area though. The best night club was Bondi on the other side of the river to Temple Bar (although again was very pricey) or for more upper class clubs, Harcourt Street is best.

All in all we had a fab time... if I was to go again I'd go in the summer as it rained every day we were there.",5,2009,04,27
211,Great location and wonderful place to stay.,"We stayed at Jury's Croke Park as part of a 51-person group from the US.  The location was wonderful because we toured Croke Park that day.  Lunch, dinner and breakfast were arranged for the group.  Lunch was a little heavy, but dinner and breakfast had great variety and satisfied everyone in the group.  

The public spaces are clean and I really appreciated the water and ice dispensers on each floor.  The rooms are spacious and well-maintained.  The room doors do make a very loud noise if they are not shut slowly, though, which can cause a lot of noise when people are returning to their rooms.  

I would have liked a hairdryer in the room, but none was available.  The rooms did have nice TVs and music systems.  Tea, coffee and a few cookies are available for free in each room.  

The hotel is just a short walk from McConnell street and the Temple Bar, but should not be walked alone late at night.  A taxi ride is only 6-8 euros and is a good investment in safety.",4,2009,04,20
211,Great Location -great price,"Stopped off here last week and loved the hotel. Had dinner in the bistro, great food and friendly service, great rooms , great price. I will return .",5,2009,04,06
211,Good Hotel High Standard for 4*,"i stayed in jurys to attend the hunky dory's fight night in the o2 arena.
we checked into the hotel at about 2pm and there was no problem checking in early! the reception staff were foregion nationals and although nice they were very slow! there was 1 man there who was very efficent, we were slightly embarassed when asked to produce a credit card to guarantee the booking when i had already booked online giving my Laser card to guarantee the booking, none of us had one so we were asked to pay on arrival!. the rooms were really nice and very spacious & clean, we also had great food in the sideline bar where we atched the ireland v's Wales game really good staff here too. beware when you lift anything out of the minibar  it automatically goes onto your blll. we learned this after lifting out the small champagne bottle and were charged €30.00 the gentleman at reception understood what had happened. free parking and free wi fi also good. Would definately stay here again and would recommend to a friend.",4,2009,03,27
211,Great hotel in Dublin,"My wife and I stayed at the Jurys Croke Park for 3 nights on March 21, 22 & 23 while ending our Ireland vacation in Dublin. We got an amazing rate from hotels.com of about $65 USD per night. The hotel is located right across the street from Croke Park, but is about a $10 euro taxi ride to the city center. The hotel staff was always helpful in getting us a taxi and giving advice on dinners and entertainment locations. The rooms were very nice and very comfortable and the bathrooms were great with a stand up shower and a bathtub. This hotel was perfect for us and we would certainly return!",5,2009,03,27
211,Nice Hotel,"Nice comfortable, clean, modern hotel with knowledable and curtious staff. I had the great pleasure of attending the Kerry v. Cork game while on holiday and it was a great experience, plus just walking across the street to get to the stadium was all too easy. 
The walk from the hotel to city center was a brisk 15-20 minute walk - good for walking off the Guinness. On days/nights that I didn't feel like walking, a cab was arranged for me. 
I've noticed comments on the quality of the beds, well I'll chime in on this and say that the bed was fantastic! Everything was clean and in working order.
The concierge was great and extremely helpful, I wish I could remember the name of the gentleman who gave me sightseeing advice daily, unfortunately my stay was 7 months ago and his name escapes me. He was a vey fun person to speak with. Cheers!",4,2009,03,20
211,Great Hotel!,"Great Hotel Especially if you are going to watch a match or see a concert, Croke Park right on your door step.
Rooms Clean & Modern, walk in shower great.
Hotel Staff Friendly, Concierge was very helpful good local knowledge nothing was too much trouble ie arranging taxi's looking after our luggage on the final day.
Hotel Restaurant a little pricey but the meal we had was well worth it, i recommend the Onion soup to start and the Lamb.
Taxi only an 8 minute ride in to Dublin Center although it is possible to walk in

Must See - Guinness store house ( Top Tip) Pre book online before you go as you receive a discount and you also miss the queues!",4,2009,03,06
211,Worth every cent!,"I really loved everything about this hotel. It has very competative rates, most of the time which is understandable considering how close it is to Croke park. It is close to the city centre. The reception staff were very helpful and friendly. They really did give the Irish welcome it's meaning. The rooms were magnificent with a walk in shower. I could not find fault with this hotel. We got more than we expected and I cannot wait to have another excuse for a return visit.",5,2009,03,01
211,The most comfortable bed I've ever slept in,"My partner booked this hotel as we went to Ireland v Georgia. The hotel was booked at short  notice and the main reason for booking is it's proximity to Croke park.

Check in was very smooth as was check out.

We stayed in a superior room, which was very spacious. The bathroom was huge and immaculate. It was nice to have a full size bath and a arge seperate shower cubicle.

The bed was a large queen size bed which had a mattress on it that must have been 12 inches thick and was just a joy to sleep in

Transport links to the hotel and around Dublin are a little hit and miss to say the least but the city centre is a walkable distance.
.",5,2009,02,24
211,Great hotel........................and if you are a GAA fan it's the nearest thing to heaven,"Stayed for the weekend of the AIB All Ireland Club Championships in February and cannot recommend this hotel enough.  Everything about it was just great.  It's promixity to Croke Park is ideal.  Checki n was fast and efficient.  We upgraded to an executive room and it was just superb.

 I have stayed in other Four Star Hotels and they could learn a lot from this hotel.  Service is excellent.  The reception staff are very helpful and don't treat you as a nuisance.

All in all a great experience",5,2009,02,18
211,Great hotel,"Booked this hotel for a six nations match and it was the perfect choice. Room was clean and spacious. We had dinner in the restaurant which was very good and breakfast was good too.

Hotel staff were extremely helpful, we appreciated the complimentary bottle of water at check out. The 15 min walk to town is pleasant. Taxi from the airport cost less than 20 EUR.",5,2009,02,14
211,Good Hotel,"We were in Dublin for an Ireland rugby match at Croke Park, and so was pleased to be able to book this hotel for the night of the match.

The quality and cleanliness of the bedroom was excellent. 

We had a meal in the evening and the food is of a high quality but overpriced, but perhaps the hotel can get away with this since it is a 15/20 minuted walk into Dublin centre.  Breakfast was included and once again it was very good.

There is a car park which is free to guests - get the reception to validate your parking ticket prior to leaving.

I would certainly recommend the hotel if you are attending a game or concert in Croke Park, but do allow for the volume of people in the bar and lobby as a result. 

All in all this is a quality hotel.",4,2008,11,24
211,Birthday Break,"The weekend was to celebrate our birthdays which fall 27 & 29 September.  We contacted the hotel to arrange flowers, birthday banners and balloons etc in the room.  They were very helpful with regard to this.  On arrival we were pleasantly suprised to find they had upgraded us to an executive room and the room was decorated as requested and the flowers were beautiful.  Breakfast was excellent and plenty of choice and service was excellent.  Although not central it was only a ten minute walk into the city centre.  Can also recommend the open top bus tour and the tour of Croke Park, the guide was very knowledgeable and enthuiastic.  All in all it was a brilliant weekend and would not hesitate to recomend this hotel and we would certainly stay there again.  One point to note Dublin is very expensive to eat and drink out.",5,2008,11,23
211,"Great, but not nice area unless you're up for the match","Yes, the hotel itself is great, especially for the price. But the area is not great unless you're up to see a match in Croke Park stadium which is opposite. It's not pretty, it feels dodgy and it's a fair walk into the centre. If it's Dublin city centre you're after then there are much better hotel choices I think, particularly the Best Western Accademy Plaza, Jurys Inn Parnell Street or the Maldron Parnell.",4,2008,11,20
211,"Highly, highly recommened!","Having just returned from my first visit to Dublin I have to let you know about the Jurys Croke Park Hotel. Situated about 10 mins walk from the hustle and bustle of the city, the hotel can be reached by the no. 41 or 16 bus for about €2 or a taxi for approx €20! You have to get off at Quinns Pub and then walk for about 5mins.....it was very cold and just starting to rain but saving 2 pints of Guinness was worth it!!

On arrival at reception we were greeted with a very nice receptionist, check in was swift and we were even given hot towels to freshen our hands! (nice touch!) 

The room was very pleasant and looked out over the front of the hotel...facing Croke Park...not a very pleasant view as it is predominantly concrete! However the room and facilities were 1st class. The bed was amazing! Fantastic nights sleep....infact all 4 of them were! There is tea and coffee making facilities, a mini fridge (very expensive! and items will be charged to your room even if you pick them up and then replace them!), the bathroom has underfloor heating and a full size shower. The toiletries are lovely! (extra 3 kilos in my suitcase on the return journey!!)

We'd upgraded to an executive room giving robes and slippers, turndown service with complimentary choccies and a lavender 'hottie' bottle!  This upgrade included complimentary breakfast in the executive lounge with tea, coffee and fruit juice being available all day. My only resevation about the exec longe was that it was used every day by aircrew and did get rather busy at certain times - often running out of pastries and simple things such as cutlery! However, as this was my 1st time in Dublin, the experience was extremely pleasant and I would certainly visit this hotel again. The staff were all very friendly and nothing was too much trouble for them.

Some must do's:

Tour of Croke Park - fascinating insite to the GAA and the ground is amazing, hard to believe that its an ameture set up! (discount given if you let them know that you are at the hotel!)

Jamiesons Distillery - volunteer to do the whiskey tasting at the end of the tour!

Guinness Brewery - best pint and the views of the city are superb!

City Bus Tour - count how many times they say Medieval and Georgian! 

Citi Bar - fantastic Irish Stew and Guinness Bread!

Take lots of euros though! I can't remember when I've had to pay so much for a pint and food (even if you're getting a snack) is expensive! But the hospitality is brilliant and even the taxi drivers are very helpful.

One place that I will definately be visiting again - but when the weather warms up!!",5,2008,11,01
211,Excellent hotel,"Excellent hotel, only problem we had was checking in - for some reason after booking through laterooms.com the hotel did not have a reservation for us, but easily sorted and we were relaxing in our executive room within 20 mts.

Bedrooms are large and airy and curtains are fab as they block out every ounce of light - the beds are huge! and the bathroom is fantasticly clean!

The fluffy dressing gowns were not that fluffy but that did not spoil our stay.  The hotel bar is very reasonably priced indeed, and if you have an executive room then complimentary continental breakfast is served in the executive lounge, where you can have as little or as much as you wish.

The hotel is only a 20 mt walk or so to the town centre so not too far at all but a taxi back at night only costs around 9/10 Euros.

211,Very Enjoyable,"We spent 3 enjoyable nights here in September. We arrived late our first night and unfortunately we were too late for a hot meal. We were able to order a sandwich and hot drinks. This was more than enough to eat as the servings were very generous.
We booked a family room which was excellent. Plasma TV and CD Player. Very large room with 2 double beds and a single bed. The breakfast was included in the nightly rate and was always excellent. Staff were very friendly and nothing was too much trouble.
Free wireless internet in the lounge was an added bonus. We would definately reccomend this hotel to anyone travelling to Dublin. Especially if attending an event at Croke Park.",5,2008,10,24
211,Great value,"We stayed for just one night at the Jurys and for the price we paid it was excellent value.

The hotel itself is mordern and well equipped with large bedrooms and superb bathrooms. 

We had lunch in the bar, the food was good if a little expensive but the staff could learn to smile a bit more.

The location is just outside of the town centre but well within walking distance. The only time we needed a taxi was coming back late at night

Overall I would recommend the Jurys and would stay again.",5,2008,10,19
211,lovely staff and good rooms,"After a long light from New Zealand me and my friend couldnt wait to collapse into bed. The staff here were very helpful and it was nice to be greeted so well. Room was large, tidy and clean. May have lacked a little charachter but that didnt bother us as we were only staying 2 nights. The bathroom was great and again it was big which i would expect at all hotels. food was good, but breakfast wasnt incuded in the price and was a bit expensive i thought. Worth noting the hotel is about 15/20 mins walk from the very centre of dublin city. Overall we had a good stay and the staff were great",3,2008,10,01
211,REALLY NICE!,"Booked through Hotels.com, great discounts. 

Pros: The Hotel was fantastic NO COMPLAINTS, clean, big rooms, tidy rooms, tidy hotel, friendly staff!!

Cons: the hotel is not perfect location. It is VERY close to the top end of O'Connel Street but O'Connel Street is not the centre of the City. Also small con is that breakfast is EUR 23 pp, but might I recommend Café Kylemore on O'Connel street for breakfast on the first morning as this is suffice, the locals love it, always busy!",4,2008,09,17
211,"""Excellent""","Would have to say that the Jurys Croke Park Hotel, was a excellent stay. Greeted by family staff, had some one help us with our luggage, and walked into a beautiful clean and nice sized room. Had room service for dinner, a little expensive (after the currancy change) but was worth it.  Had a great sleep, and woke to a huge hot and cold breakfast. The breakfast had a little of everthing and went down well..Definately worth the money and would recommend to anyone.",5,2008,09,08
211,Not Convincing,"Though being an experienced city traveller, the attractiveness of Dublin came to me as an unexpected, but very pleasant surprise. It's historic city center - and especially the Temple Bar district - is an attractive and inspiring place to spend your time. With it's countless trendy bars, restaurants and shops it's an ideal area to stroll and chill out. During our Dublin sojourn we stayed for 7 nights at the Jurys Croke Park Hotel, but not totally to our satisfaction. The hotel is modern and well equipped. Our room was spacious and clean and we really really loved the hotel gym. But unfortunately we experienced the attitude of the hotel staff as very unpersonal. I also like to stress the awkwardness of it's location: a fiteen minutes walk from the city center and situated in an unpleasant neighbourhood. But when in Dublin, do visit Fallon & Byrne (Exchequer Street): the best restaurant, wine bar and food hall in town. It serves carrot cakes to die for. And for the luxury shopaholics, I utterly recommend a visit to Brown Thomas (Grafton Street): Dublin's most inspiring department store.",3,2008,08,26
211,Nice Hotel,"This hotel is modern and well appointed.  It has a very nice bar with great atmosphere, a nice lobby, and the rooms were very comfortable.  The bed was amazingly comfortable.  The breakfast each morning was impressive with hot and cold choices.  The front desk and concierge was very helpful and friendly.  The only down side is the location.  It is a about 15 minutes walk to the center of Dublin.  While I did not feel worried or unsafe in the area, it is not the nice side of town.  So, late at night, we always took a taxi.  For us, the walk was not a big problem, so it was not a huge sacrifice.  But, if I had not gotten such a good price, I probably would have opted to stay somewhere more central.  But,  I received a discounted price and I am very happy with my choice to stay here.  Dublin was great, and I also recommend day trips to Wicklow and to Howth to get of town for a day or two if possible.  Great pub life at night !  We really enjoyed our stay in Dublin.",4,2008,07,21
211,very nice,"My wife and I used this hotel as a base whilst visiting old friends in dublin.  Like many of the other reviews, we found that this hotel exceeded all our expectations.  All staff were more than helpful.  The location suited us fine, and the walk to town was no more than 20mins - helped shed a few lbs from the guinness!   The rooms were well finished, breakfast was a luxury and the bar room was beautiful (nice fireplace!).  We shall be hoping to visit sometime soon and repeat staying in this hotel.",5,2008,07,10
211,Great deal,"For a very reasonable rate, we got a spacious room, with two rwin beds, a sparking clean big bathroom, plasma TV, stereo system. Recommended for those who don't mind being a 20-minute walk from Dublin center. A great deal for the price we paid.",5,2008,07,04
211,"Excellent, top class hotel","Stayed for two nights recently and was extremely impressed with everything about the place. Rooms were very very large as was bathroom, very well fitted. Hotel bar is nice, bar food is very good, breakfast was excellent. Staff were very nice and very helpful",5,2008,06,29
211,excellent hotel,"booked this hotel with the intention of seeing 'Prince' in concert at croke park stadium, though the concert ended up being cancelled! despite this, my husband and i decided to give ourselves a well earned break!
the location to croke park is excellent. other reviewers thought that the hotel was a little 'out of the way', it is merely a 15 minute walk. 
the hotel is everything you would wish for. we got to stay in an executive room. what a fantastic kingsize bed!!! lovely tv and cd player, and a good range of toiletries in the beautiful bathroom.
breakfast was very good, such a choice, and all so fresh.breakfast staff were helpful and pleasant
we ate in the bar once, thought the menu could do with being extended a little, and bordering on a little pricey, but once again, it is quality. room service menu again was very limited, and a little pricey.
staying in an executive room gave us the use of the executive lounge, where the use of a coffee machine, biscuits, fresh juices and fruit were constant. there was talk on another review of a happy hour there from 6-7pm, but this did not happen with us??
i feel that the guest needs to be more informed of the executive lounge, as we only knew because of reading other trip advisor reviews.
some difference in nightly rates upon checking out, but this was rectified.
overall, a very good stay, which we hope to repeat, no matter what the reason for our visit!",5,2008,06,17
211,loved it,"i stayed here on an overnight for a girls night away. lovely spacious room, well equipped, lovely modern bathroom, and a well stocked mini bar at reasonable prices. i didnt have dinner in the hotel as we had reservations made in the city. it cost 12euro in a taxi to temple bar. breakfast the next morning was lovely. very friendly and helpful staff. i cannot say enough nice things about this hotel",5,2008,06,03
211,"Modern, Sophisticated and Affordable Hotel","Definitely visit the Croke Park if you are looking for a modern mid-level luxury hotel in Dublin. The hotel is very sophisticated. The restaurant and lounge serve great food in a modern atmosphere. The staff is helpful, the room large, the bathroom brand new--it has everything a traveler needs for an exceptional stay. Very clean, very appealing to the eye, very comfortable. The location is probably 3/4 a mile from city center, but it's still possible to walk or take a short cab to the Liffey. Definitely visit this hotel when in Dublin...you will not be disappointed!",5,2008,05,27
211,Excellent Hotel and Staff,"This is an excellent.

Rooms excellent and staff are excellent.

Had an executive room with free complimentary breakfast and use of the executive lounge all day (+ free happy hour each night between 6-7)

Rooms and bathrooms are very, good.  Eat one night in the bar and meal good and reasonable price.

Free car parking and only about 10-15 minutes walk into the centre of dublin.

If you get it for the right price then book it.

Opposite Croke park and easy to find.

We had no problems at all and if the price was right would have no hesitation in going back",5,2008,05,05
211,Loved this Hotel,"This is a fantastic hotel, excellent location and accommodation is to a very high standard.  Staff were very pleasant and helpful.  I have stayed in many hotels for work but this did far exceed my expectations.",5,2008,05,02
211,Perfect Base for Dublin City Break,"I stayed at the Jurys Croke Park early March with my husband and baby daughter while we were visiting friends in Dublin. Staff did everything possible to make our stay the most pleasant. We had requested a baby cot and sure enough it was in the room along with bedding and extra towels for the baby. The room was of a very high standard and the bathroom was fantastic. 
the common areas of the hotel were also lovely, with a huge TV screen in one of the lounges while the library and its log fire were a nice place to relax. Brekfast as very good and again there was a high chair for our daughter although she wasn't eating the hotel food. During the weekend we ordered cabs several times and asked the conierge for advice. All these services were efficient as you would expect from a 4* hotel. I would gladly go back as the hotel made our stay in a city with a small child as painless as it can be.",4,2008,04,14
211,"Recommended - Jury's, Croke Park.","Spent an overnight in Jury's, Croke Park. Stayed in an Executive room .Recommended and definitely worth the extra. Reception, lounge staff, room cleaning, concierge  and all staff were helpful, friendly and  very professional. The area itself is quiet when there are no matches being played. We walked to the City Centre - about 15 mins. 
We would definitely stay in this hotel again.",5,2008,04,13
211,Very impressed,"I stayed in Jury's Croke Park the night before a corporate event and was very impressed. My expectations were definitely exceeded. Reception staff were professional, friendly and polite and the offer of a hot towel to freshen up on arrival was a pleasant surprise. The room was spacious, although the lighting was a little dim in the bedroom and glaringly bright in the bathroom, which made make-up application a bit tricky (think of Bridget Jones applying make-up in the taxi scene)! The lounge area was very comfortable - loved the fireplace and, while massive TV screens aren't my thing, I'm sure many are drawn to this unmissable feature. I would definitely recommend this hotel and will probably return.",4,2008,04,13
211,great place,"This was a very nice stay.  The hotel staff was extremely accomodating in every sense.  We arrived at about 7am after an overnight flight.  They advised us that they were going to get a room for us as soon as one was available and cleaned.  We stayed in the lounge and napped for a bit and the room was ready.  The room was great.  Spacious (for European rooms) with nice comfortable decor.  The bed was extremely comfortable with great linens.  Plenty of organizational room/storage.  The bath was wonderful.  A nice large tub and a nice large separate shower with great shower heads.  Lots of great amenities including great toiletries, a couple of small snacks, teas and coffee selection.

The location is good, which I was worried about before arriving.  It is in a quiet location (unless there is an event at Croke Park--literally 200 yards away) however, it is just about 5 blocks to get into Dublin.  We walked everywhere and when we took the Dublin double decker 23 stop bus tour, we picked it up about 4 blocks from the hotel.

The concierge was great and extremely helpful.  We got engaged while in Dublin and he arranged a taxi and reservations at a great restaurant for us.

Breakfast was great!  The lounge is a fairly busy place on the weekends.  Food was good, but the food and drink was a bit pricey.  Worth it once.

All in all, if you are staying in Dublin, stay at the Jurys Croke Park.  Don't worry with the location.  It is worth saving quite a bit of money to not stay right inside Dublin city center when you can walk there in 10 minutes.",5,2008,04,08
211,Good Hotel - OK Location,I stayed here on business. I chose this hotel above others because it had free parking and a free shuttle to the East Point Business Park. The hotel is fairly new. The rooms are spacious and modern and the same with the bathroom. The TV is great and has a lot of channels. It is opposite Croke Park so the night I arrived there was a GAA match so the hotel was fairly crowded and if I opened the windows there was a lot of noise from late night drinkers who had opted to stay the night. After that night though it was quiet. The free shuttle bus is great but you do need to book it the night before and it does fill up fast. Also I would advise that you actually book it in person at reception because 2 days out of four I went down to get it and was told that my name actually wasnt on the list. Luckily I managed to get on anyway as there was a free space. I also wasnt too bothered as I had my own car and it is only a 15 minute walk to the business park anyway. I also called the first night I arrived to ask if breakfast was included in my rate and I was told it wasnt but afterwards I found out that it should have been. Parking is free... you just need to get your ticket validated at reception when you want to leave. The hotel is very secure which I liked... you needed to swipe your card to take the lift up to the rooms which is a nice touch. The immediate vicinity is very very quiet at night. I didnt feel unsafe... but I didnt like walking around for too long after dark either. A taxi cost less than €10 from O Connell Street to the hotel and although I didnt walk I think it is about a 20 - 30 minute walk.,4,2008,03,03
211,Best beds,"Great hotel for a short trip to dublin. large car park on site, saff were welcoming and check in was quick & efficient. Modern decor is light and pleasant. Rooms very comfortable, bed was the best I ever slept in. Great bathrooms, large separate shower as well as bath. Well equipped room with flat screen tv, cd player, free internet, iron& ironing board. Will stay here again.",5,2008,02,16
211,Beware of Booking on line,"From reading the reviews, most people have had good experiences with this hotel. The amenities are much the same as any large chain and so if all goes well you will have a good stay.
I booked online and when I arrived late eveing was told there had been an overbooking and I was to be transferred to another hotel: the Crowne Plaza at the airport which was an awful place.

If I book to stay at a particlar place I expect that booking to be honoured. I am told that this is normal practice for some hotels to overbook slightly, as do airlines. If everyone turns up, it then goes pear shaped.

My experience was that the front of house staff were not equipped with the necessary skills to deal with an unhappy guest: repeatedly offering compensation such as a free meal or upgrade on my return. All I really wanted was evidence that this error was taken on board and would not happen again.

The hotel itself was fine. Its just that it cannot cope with the errors once it has made them.",1,2008,02,05
211,Great Hotel,I stayed in the Jurys Croke Park Hotel in December as our company was having its christmas party in the Croke Park Stadium. It was right accross the road. Ideal if you are travelling to Dublin for GAA games or concerts in Croke Park. Stayed in a triple room (1 single bed and 1 double). wich was a little cramped but it was fine. Bathroom was huge. Nice big shower. Staff were great. Secure underground parking available. Approx 20 min walk to Dublin City Centre (O'Connel Street). Highly recommended.,4,2008,01,18
211,Very Good,"We stayed at this hotel in November and overall it was excellent.
The hotel staff are very good and friendly.The rooms are very modern clean and have good fittings , such as FPL screen etc.The bathroom is very good , large with both bath and large separate shower.The facilities are all very good from the nice reception area to the good bar and restaurant where breakfast is very good and help yourself with all tastes catered for.
There is also the nice touch of free internet access on 2 PC's in reception along with the gym.
This hotel is located approx 15 mins walk from the main centre , but we walked this several times and it was fine.
Overall I would recommend this hotel to anyone - very good , defintely one of the best 4* hotels we have styayed in.",5,2007,11,12
211,"Spacious rooms, clean, modern, efficient service and good value for money","We booked this hotel as one of Lastminute.com’s ‘Top Secret’ Hotels and were not disappointed.   The rate we received for a Saturday night over the Bank Holiday weekend was extremely good value for money.  

The hotel is very modern, rooms spacious with lovely comfortable beds.  A separate bath and shower is also quite unique and a nice touch.  We didn’t use the hotel bar or have breakfast but the bar area (and all other communal) areas seemed cosy and inviting.   The service was very efficient.  The hotel gym is quite small but very modern and was completely empty when we visited.  

Location wise it’s a 15 minute walk to O’Connell Street and then a further 10-15 minutes to Temple Bar (through the Saturday afternoon crowds).  Or you can get a cab for about 10 Euros.   

Would definitely recommend this hotel if you’re not too bothered about being right in the heart of the city centre.",4,2007,11,01
211,Absolutely Fabulous!,"Oh My Gosh!
This was my absolute favorite hotel of all time! It was just so gorgeous! It's only a 10 minute walk from Dublin City Centre, it is only across the road from Croke Park Stadium! I must admit, after reading other reviews i was not looking forward to staying here but when i arrived i realised the lies! To start, the lobby was clean & modern, the lifts were quick, efficient & clean, the hall ways were decent sizes & when we got to the room we were so overjoyed! It was fabulous! Huge rooms with heaps of free amenities! Big Room with a Study Desk. Big Plasma TV with lots of Entertainment available! Comfortable Beds with great Pillows that are sooooo nice & soft! Shower was good & room was clean & bright & stylized beautifully! Breakfast & Staff were very good but a little pricey menu but well worth it! Stay here! Just perfect!",5,2007,09,27
211,Last Minute Marvel!,"Travelling back from a great holiday in Prague, we needed somewhere to stay in dublin for one night.  We looked on a last minute website and found a room in this hotel for a very very good price.

We arrived late at about 11:30pm, but it was no problem.  The hotel has very new and very stylish and the staff were very friendly!

The room was of a very high standard with a massive bed, 32"" flat screen, mini bar, and lots of other nice little touches.

We were gasping for a drink but didnt think we would be able to get one as the bar was closed for the night.  However we asked at reception and they said no problem!  We went into the library and sat by the fire and they brought us our drinks, one of the best pints of Guiness ive ever had.

We left the next morning so the stay was very brief but excellent all round.  I would definately stay again and highly reccomend it.",5,2007,09,17
211,aloof and sullen staff,"This is a great hotel although a good mile or so from City Center. There is nothing to add about the clean, new and comfortable rooms other than what has already been said, we did find the breakfast to be good as well, especially the coffee and the restaurant staff was friendly and efficient. The concierge as well was friendly and helpful. 
Now the bad news... the front desk at all times was manned or womaned by the most aloof and sullen group we've ever come across, including NYC. There was never a smile or eye contact, any request for assistance was turfed to the concierge. Calling a taxi or answering any questions or giving directions seemed benieth them. It was so bad it became a source of amusement for my husband myself, sometimes you just have to laugh. Also a repeated request to fix the room safe was ignored.",4,2007,09,15
211,Amazing!,"Wow! Words cannot describe how happy I was with this hotel. I've stayed in many European hotels with their tiny bathrooms and crappy beds. This is NOT one of them! The hotel is immaculate and the rooms are beautiful and well appointed. The bathroom was HUGE! The bed was so comfy and it had a flat screen tv! The staff are so nice, especially Damian at the front desk. The only downside is that it's about a 10-15 minute walk to City Centre which isn't a big deal, but the area you have to walk through seemed a little sketchy at night. The only other thing is that the breakfast is mediocre but I attribute my feelings on this to having an American palatte. Bottomline: STAY HERE! It's a great place and I would DEFINITELY stay there again! Best hotel in all of Ireland!

211,Supberb hotel,"Stayed in this Hotel for the first time at the end of May and can hand on heart say that it was one of the most impressive hotels that i have ever stayed in.
Obviously being a newish hotel wear and tear might not yet be overtly obvious ,but the rooms and common areas were absoloutely pristine.
The rooms are,spacious and the bed is the most comfortable i have ever slept in ,the buffet breakfast  excellent.(cannot comment on the restauarnt as we ate in town in the evenings)and the staff friendly and courteous.
As previous reviews have mentioned it is a 15-20 minutewalk but having stayed in various 4* City Centre hotels previously , it is in my opinion well worth it.

",5,2007,07,19
211,Great hotel Iffy food,"Really impressed with this hotel. Rooms are above average. Its is, though, a little far to walk from everything. Taxis are the order of the day.and are quite reasonable. 
Breakfast in the hotel is enough food for the hole day. Which is good as the only let down in the hotel is the dinner menu.
Drinks in the hotel are expensive but that very normal for Dublin.

",4,2007,07,15
211,Loved the Jurys Croke Park Hotel,"What can I say, Staff very friendly and professional, Food was excellent(courgette and mint soup, delicious), bar was not cheap but nowhere in dublin is, and lastly the room was wonderful, large bathroom with full size bath, double size shower, first class toiletries. Bedroom, massive king size bed, 27"" flat wide screen tv, cd music centre, plenty wardrobe/suitcase space.

",5,2007,07,07
211,Wonderful room; iffy game-day service,"The location isn't the best, but it's a quick cab ride down into town for jet-lagged tourists. The staff was friendly, but very over-worked as we arrived on a day with two matches in the stadium across the street. Half the time, I was unable to reach any staff at the front desk by phone and when I did, they were having trouble hearing me because of the noise in the lobby. In fact, I never received my wake-up call in the morning (crucial with the jet-lag) and, therefore, got off to a very late start the next day.

The rooms are good sized, full of amenities and the beds are very comfortable. The bathrooms are large and the roomy tub was a great thing after a day of walking and sightseeing.

As long as you check the Croke Park Stadium schedule before booking and know that there isn't a game scheduled during your stay, I would recommend this hotel. (We were booked into as part of a package tour and, thus, had no choice.)
",3,2007,06,17
211,Not value for money,"Stayed for a night as I got in from London in the night.
The room is clean, with a king size bed and a 4-star bathroom.
Services and friendliness @hotel are on an average level.
Location is not near city centre at all. I changed to Jury Inn Parnell St the very next day by taking a 10mins taxi there.
Paid 131euros for a night here but without b'fast. The b'fast is about euro 18/person, added up to the hotel, you will do well to stay at Hilton at city centre for $150/b'fast included for 2 persons.
Jurys hotel website is excellent for booking. I could also make amendments on my bookings easily. Very good website.
",3,2007,06,05
211,really really good quality hotel,"I was really impressed with this hotel. We were a bit concerned about the distance from dublin city centre at first but we didn't need to worry. In the day we had a two minute walk through terraced streets to the bus stop, the buses were frequent and cheap. We spent the day in Dublin and came back to the hotel at the end of the night by taxi which was quite reasonable. Ideally we would have liked a city centre hotel but for the price we paid to stay in the Jury's croke park we wouldn't have got anywhere near as nice in the city centre. 
I cant comment on the hotel dinners but the breakfasts which were included in the room rate were excellent. As it was a buffet style we would eat so much that we didn't need to eat again until the evening!! there was plenty of choice of both hot and cold food. we had drinks in the hotel bar one night which we thought were pretty expensive but compared to what we are used to we found drinking anywhere in dublin very expensive. 
the best things about the rooms were they were very clean, the beds were really comfy and the showers were powerful and always hot. the hotel doesn't have a pool which i would say is the only down side, the location is a down side only if you are not willing to travel to reach the city centre. this hotel is really good value for money. the only tip i would give you is if you arrive back at the hotel late at night make sure you remember what your room number is. my friend came back to the hotel very late, slightly tipsy and was asked at the door for her name and room number, when she couldn't remember her room number she was interogated by the hotel staff and refused entry!

",4,2007,05,15
211,Outstanding Hotel; Far away from Downtown Dublin,"The hotel is unbelieveable for european standards.  Flat screen tv's, large beds, large rooms with ample workspace, and wired internet access in all rooms.  The only problem with the hotel is that is located very, very north of downtown Dublin.  Expect a 20 minute walk just to get to the very north side of Dublin.  Expect close to a 60 minute walk to the Guiness Storehouse.  There are no area resturants or pubs near the hotel so expect to eat there as well.  However, the hotel bar and resturant are very good.  Overall, I really enjoyed the hotel just wished it were closer to all Dublin Attractions.

211,Ultimate in luxury - why only 4 stars?,"After a fab honeymoon in Barcelona, instead of going straight home from the airport, we decided to book a romantic night in the new Jury's Croke Park. 

When we got there, we couldn't believe the luxury! We stayed in a 'supposed' 4 star hotel in Barcelona that was not impressive. Coming back to spend the night here made us realise exactly what 4 star should have meant in Barcelona.

The room was fantastic. We stayed on the executive floor, normally held aside for business guests. It had a wonderful executive lounge with flowing tea, coffee, cappucinos and juices, all available for free anytime. The room itself had one of the best beds I've ever slept in. It was huge and really comfortable. The TV was top notch with tonnes of channels and the bathroom was fab!! The shower was excellent and I love that the bath was separate. 

The bar food was nice but not spectacular, could have been warmer. The service in general overall was second to none and the buffet breakfast the next morning was really yummy. 

Location wasn't brilliant but bus is practically on the doorstep and if you're up for the walk, it's about 20-30 mins walk to the city.

",5,2007,04,18
211,A good Hotel,"A very comfortable hotel in a convenient spot particularly when traveling by car.
Nice to have a bathroom with both a bath and an oversize shower cubicle
I was there the weekend of the Ireland/France rugby match and although the hotel bar was packed after the game the noise did not permeate to the rooms.
The staff throughout my five day stay were very helpful despite the extra pressures.
One downside is the restaurant menu which if you're stay is more than two nights would become very boring and you'd need to find a restaurant

",4,2007,03,06
211,Everything is new and quite luxurious,"My girlfriends and I stayed at the Jurys Croke Park Hotel as part of a guided tour of Ireland. Because this hotel was already chosen for us, we were apprehensive of the quality and available amenities. We were very impressed with its quality and service. The rooms seemed ""brand-new"" and contained flat-screen TV's and the most luxurious, comfortable beds I have ever found in a hotel. The hotel opened in 2005, so there's only 2 years of ""wear and tear"" which is not even evident.  The lounge was very comfortable with soft couches and chairs and an attentive wait staff. The daily ""Irish breakfast"" (which was included in our tour - I'm not sure if it's included in the regular price of a room) was substantial and offered a refreshing variety of fresh food that was always being replenished. The hotel is located a short cab ride from the 'Temple Bar' area of Dublin. The rooms were quiet and the clientele seemed to be mostly professionals.

",4,2007,03,05
211,Good location?,"First of all, the Jurys Croke Park Hotel has good standard, above average. Absolutely nothing to complain about the room, with a very good and large bed. 
Our price did not include breakfast, and we thought they kept too high prices (breakfast 18 Euro), so we didn't eat at the hotel. But we got good advice and help booking table for dinner.
At least during winter, it seems like most thing happens around Temple Bar. It's a bit too far to walk back to the hotel after a long night with dinner and live music bars, so for us it meant a few taxi-trips. From Temple Bar it cost about 10 Euro. If visiting Dublin again, I would consider a hotel closer to the city centre.
",4,2007,02,21
211,Still love this hotel,"Stayed here for the second time for a rugby match at croke park.  room was lovely. staff very helpful. 

only crtiicism was that after match too many non residents were allowed into the hotel.  the bar was jam packed. b4 match door men were more careful.

not very many restaurants near here, but easy to get a taxi into town.

got upgraded first time here.  not this time but room very similar.

wil stay here again!
",5,2007,02,17
211,great location,"we have stayed at this hotel twice and had problems both times. on the first occasion we checked into the room and after a while discovered that the sink in the bathroom was leaking badly i.e. the water was pouring out underneath onto the floor.instead of moving us to a different room straigt away we had to wait 2 hours for the maintenance guy to come and look at it . he then told us that they knew there was a problem with the sink but they continued to use the room. we eventually got moved to a different room. on our second stay there we were told on arrival that we couldnt check in until 5pm . granted there was a match on that day but that was no excuse as thay should have anticipated how busy it was going to be . but the most annoying thing was that at 0750 the following morning a member of the housekeeping staff knocked on our door and proceeded to enter the room . now we were checking out that day and there was no reason for her to come near our room. is is nice to be able to enjoy a lie in when you are away without such disturbances. it is a pity that such a lovely hotel has such bad management .
",3,2007,02,03
211,a fantastic hotel.,"I stayed at this hotel for 4 nights in January 2007 for business.  The hotel is very modern and the rooms where well designed and large and at €109 per night this place was a bargain. i particularly enjoyed the excellent flat screen TV with loads of sky TV channels.  The food in the bar was also very good and the staff where very attentive (did not try the restaurant but I am sure it would be very nice).

The hotel is about a 10-15min walk to the very top of O’Connell Street so is very well placed to visit the city centre.

All in all I thoroughly recommend this hotel and I would definitely stay here again.

",5,2007,01,18
211,Cool Hotel,"Having looked at Tripadvisor reviews I decided to pick the Jurys Croke Park Hotel. Stayed 2 nights with my girlfriend and had a great stay. The walk into the City is fair, but not too long, we stayed in Nov and although the weather a bit chilly, walked back and forth quite a few times without need for taxi's. A few people had commented on the area being a bit rough, I didn't think this to be the case, was just like walking around the outskirts of most cities I have visited, all streets well lit and residential, you even walked past the Garda station. Rooms were really nice, liked the high comfy beds, funky seating, cool tv, felt like staying in a higher rated hotel just because it was so fresh, clean and modern. We ate in the bar/lounge (we didn't visit main restaurant),  which was good value and really nice. Service from reception to bar staff superb, happy & helpful, as it should be. Cool hotel, good value, good stay, I recommend it.

211,Nice and modern,"Had a very nice stay at this hotel for three nights late in november. The room was great, except for a noisy firedoor between the staircase and the hallway on the 1st floor . 
Clean - but we were a bit surprised to find a maid in our room when we went up after a rather early breakfast. At breakfast the waitress came to take our plates when we were still eating - that was not so nice. Gave us a feeling that they wanted to speed up our breakfast.  
The location of the hotel is great - only a nice walk from the city center and in a rather quiet area. Slept well there!!
Minimalistic, modern and tastefull furniture and design.
Professional and well qualified receptionists. We would not hesitate to go back some other time.

211,Ideal business hotel,"This hotel is modern, clean and stylish. I've stayed here a number of times and it's always been a very pleasant stay.

Good points - very clean, good food, not all that far from city centre, good bar, lcd tv, very comfy bed, free parking in underground parking and helpful staff.

Minor niggles -  there are sometimes tour parties who are checking in or checking out which can swamp the reception a little. I can't find the difference between the standard and executive rooms!

I do feel that broadband should be included in the executive room rate.",5,2006,11,26
211,Great hotel,"Have to recommend this hotel! Stayed here for three nights on a weekend break to Dublin and loved it.  It's about a 15 minute walk to O'Connell Street, which is fine as long as it's not raining and windy.  The rooms are spacious and very modern & the bar is a nice spot to relax.  Can't fault the staff at all as everyone that we encountered was very friendly.  I'd imagine it's very busy when there are matches or concerts on in Croke Park but I'd definitely come back again.
",4,2006,11,22
211,Loved this hotel!!,"Stayed for 2 nights and we absolutly loved it there! Decor was very modern and stylish, beds nice and big and also very comfy! Rooms had iron and ironing board, hairdryer, tea and coffee, bath and shower, 24hr room service, minibar. The hotel bar was relaxing and sold really nice food. Hotel staff were very friendly. 

Would reccommend this hotel to anyone and would definately stay again. Cost us 16euros for a taxi from airpost to hotel, 20 euros to get back (cant understand how it was more though!) Taxi into Dublin town cost us around 10 euros. To walk it takes about 10-15minutes.

211,Brown but brilliant,"We had just spent 2 days in a stylish but freezing cold new hotel in Castlebar.  It was such a relief to get to Jurys at Croke Park and to receive a warm welcome in an immaculate hotel.  It is about 20 minutes walking from the centre and in a quiet area (unless the football stadium opposite was in use!)

The rooms were stylish, super clean, warm and inviting.  The bathroom was of an excellent standard with a full stand-in shower and seperate bath to please both hubby and I.  We had paid a little extra for the champagne and chocolates which added to the indulgence effect.

The bar and restaurant areas were equally stylish and run by very friendly and helpful staff.  The evening bar meal was well above the normal hotel standard and the breakfast was similar.  Hubby wasn't sure about the high tables and low seating, but I reiterated it looked great and there was less distance to drop food!

On planning our sightseeing the following day, the reception staff were exceptionally helpful and took the time to explain things to us even when busy.  Bags were kept for us at the hotel until the end of the day and someone assisted loading into our vehicle when we returned.

In summary, we highly recommend this hotel for a break in Dublin and can offer little negative about it other than the usual troublesome shower.  What's with the 'brown but brilliant', sadly this was my school uniform color and I have destested ever since.  The fact that this was the predominate color throughout the hotel and I still enjoyed so much speaks volumes!

211,Fine Hotel,"I stayed here with 7 other family members  for our final weekend in Ireland.  This hotel was the nicest one we stayed in during our trip.  The most comfortable beds I have slept in, a wonderful shower with oversized towels, a modern workout room, and very friendly staff.  We did need to take taxis several times to the city centre as we were not familiar with Dublin, and this hotel was a bit further out than the map led me to believe, but we knew we might need to cab it so were not completely taken by surprise.
",5,2006,10,17
211,"Great Hotel, Not So Great Location","The rooms are excellent, beautifully fitted out with more than enough room to swing the proverbial cat.

You can expect a spotless bedroom/bathroom, large bed, plasma TV, CD player, tea & coffee making facilities and electronic safe.  We really liked the fact that the bath and shower were separate too.

The downside is the location.  It's a good 15-20 minute straight walk to O'Connell Street.  We have no idea if there were public transport options, we did not see any.

Bear in mind that this hotel is across the street from one of the biggest sporting arenas in Europe, and be prepared for people flocking to the gigantic stadium across the street on match/concert days - check whether there is an event on before you stay!  That said, this is a great hotel with excellent value for money in terms of what you get.

211,"Jury's Croke Park Hote, Dublin--Superb Hotel, Mediocre food.","One of the best fitted out hotels I've stayed in with extremely well-equipped bedrooms and excellent bathrooms with bath and separate shower.  The beds were very comfortable.

I was staying with a group and this 4* hotel was serving up unimaginitive, mediocre food that was often lukewarm to cool.  In five meals taken, there was only one that was almost acceptable.  I have eaten much better food in 3* and below.

The hotel is not in a very salubrious area, and is 20/30 minutes walking to Dublin centre.  There is a bus route about 5 minutes away and there can be quite a wait for a taxi.

211,Excellent hotel,"Stayed at Jury's Croke park for the one night with my boyfriend. Booked an executive upgrade room with complimentary bottle of champagne and  chocolates upon arrival. 
We had a lovely time there at Jury's. The room was spacious, modern and with all the little niceties you'd expect from a 4/5 star hotel.

Reception staff were efficient and friendly. We were asked at least twice during our stay there if everything was to our satisfaciton and if it wasn't not to hesitate alerting the staff. 

The bed was very comfortable, the mini bar packed with goodies!
The room service menu was good, and they offered a 24 hour menu to choose from also. 
We visited one of the bars downstairs for drinks in the evening time, and again the staff we very friendly and the service was excellent.
This Jury's is a little gem. The location isn't probably ideal at the moment, but in a few years with the refurbishment thats planned for that part of Dublin, you'll find it hard to get an executive room here for 2 for one night for €129!
Booked with lastminute.ie by the way.

211,Excellent,"A fabulous hotel, staff were friendly and courteous - food was gorgeous and very well presented.  Rooms are really luxurious.  Ideal base if going to Croke Park - the tour is very worthwhile. Location is on outskirts of city - you can walk but taxi is advisable.
Overall a great hotel with excellent facilities and an underground car park.

211,Nice Hotel,"Stayed here in September 2006 and I thought it was great compared to some of the other jurys i've stayed in.  Got a room only for €109 directly from their own webiste.  Requested double room and got a double room with two double beds.  Stayed in room 301 which was directly across from the lifts but there was very little noise.  Rooms had plasma screen TV, CD player, big workstation with interenet access.  Bathroom was big with seperate shower and bath.  Towels were big !  The beds were really comfy, could have stayed in them all day.  The bar in the hotel was really nice and they have a gym also.  Parking was free under the hotel.  The staff were friendly also so I was very impressed. The only downer is the location  - it's fine if you know Dublin but for a overseas visiter it might seem a bit out of the way even through it's not.  A taxi to O'Connell Street is just €7 its about 300 meters to nearest bus stop.  
Recommended.

211,WOW!,"The hotel just had it's 1st anniversary Sept 8, 2006 while we were there, but it still feels brand new.  The rooms even smell new.  The staff is excellent, rooms are large and very nicely decorated, bathrooms are huge with separate tub/shower, and a complete range of services are available.  This is a really, really nice hotel at an amazing price given the other options.

The only bad thing is the location.  Dublin is currently revitalizing the area the hotel is in and some areas aren't that nice and some buildings are in the process of being renovated or torn down to be replaced.  That being said, a taxi to down town will only cost 7 euro, and the tram which will take you downtown (5-10 minutes) or even to the exact opposite side of town (20 minutes) is only 2 euro.  There is ample parking which must be paid for.  You could walk downtown in about 30 minutes which is not unreasonable.  There are a lot of pubs and shops (convenience stores) and some lower end restaurants within the surrounding blocks.

211,Great Hotel,"We had a great experience at this hotel.  The conceirge was so helpful in recommending restaurants and things to do.  The rooms were nicely furnished and the beds were so comfortable.  I would compare it to a W hotel here in the U.S.  The location is out of the way, but we enjoyed being across from Croke Park.  We went on the stadium tour and visited the museum where we got to try our hand at hurling and gaelic football.  Central Dublin is an easy taxi ride (about 8 euro).

211,Fantastic value,"Very new and very good.  Could still beleive you are the first people to use the excellent rooms.  We paif €90 per night which is unbelievable value for a quality 4 star hotel.  Location is about 25 minute walk from city centre which is a good thing as the centre is over crowded and chaotic.
",5,2006,09,08
211,"Excellent hotel, location stinks","Hotel was almost new when I was there (April 2006). Bathroom had separate bath and shover, LCD-tv etc...

Location was not the best for walking to the city centre, you have to walk through a ""white trash"" area but buses are quite near and those were handy.

I had a room with a view to the little, brown river and ugly houses but I liked it, it was a lot nicer than to the road. 

But the hotel was excellent, it is what you can expect for a brand new.

Prices may vary a lot! I got mine for 66.00EUR/night! 
I booked from the hotel's website (without breakfast) 2 weeks before the visit.",4,2006,09,04
211,A pleasure to stay,"I recently stayed at the Jurys Croke Park Hotel, and all i can say was that it was a pleasure.  After check in went straight up to our room on the Executive Floor (4), our room was very clean, very comfortable with Champagne and Chocolates awaiting our arrival (part of a deal).  The underground heating in the bathroom was a very nice touch, also all the toiletries, a lovely selection.  Because we were on the 4th floor, we had access to the Executive Lounge which was fabulous area for people to relax with a news paper or book with as much tea/coffee/juice as you could want.  Please other hotels, take note! The bed, oh the bed, its the stuff that dreams are made off, so comfortable, the thoughts of leaving it was very upsetting.  But leave it I did, to go to breakfast, we were seated very promptly and then went to pick out our perfect breakfast, all freshly cooked and piping hot.  With plenty of everything and having filled ourselves up till lunch, we went and relaxed in the Executive Lounge, a perfect way to start a Saturday morning.  I would recommend this hotel to anyone, yes a little bit away from the main area of Dublin, but nothing that a taxi or brisk walk cant cover!! The staff are very friendly and more than happy to do anything to make your stay even better. Highly recommended.
",5,2006,08,21
211,excellent,"This hotel is less than two years old, and it's everything you would
want from a modern hotel for tourists or business travellers.
The rooms are spacious, clean and comfortable, with big flat-screen (if you need it), and internet access for 10 euro per day.  My bed had a _very_ comfortable mattress.  On my last day, the breakfast room was especially busy and I wondered if it might affect my schedule, but the whole place runs like clockwork - nice buffet breakfast with real fresh fruit, not tinned, and a good irish breakfast too!

The only downside is the location.  It's slightly dodgy.  In fact if you accidentally headed south instead of the direct south-west route to the city center, I was told by a local that it is very dodgy.  So you are on the border of a rough area.  I asked a cab driver about walking to the hotel late evening at 11pm or midnight, and he laughed and said 'Well I would stick to the main route'.  On the
other hand the cab fare from Upper Connell St is only about 6 euros, and there is a taxi-rank there, so it's easy to take the cab.

Definitely gets my full recommendation.  But if you want a nice hotel _and_ nice surroundings where you can stroll out, try St Stephen's Green or south of that area.

211,"A must for GAA fans,we travelled from cork","I stayed at jurys croke park with my husband and 2 kids for 1 night. We were in Dublin for the GAA matches and i must say it was fantastic to be able to walk accross the road after the match to your hotel. It was totally different for us as we are usually rushing around to get to a hotel in all the traffic after a match.Also the room was fantastic , flat screen t.v.with all the sky channels which kept the kids very happy , the bed was the most comfortable that i have ever slept in,especially in a hotel.The room was spotless and had a touch of luxury about it . I will definately will be returning, well worth the money......

211,Is this Dublin's best kept secret?,"This place deserves all the credit it's getting - and some. Delightful, elegant and spacious rooms which are spotlessly clean obviously help, but so do the great staff. You can sense they enjoy working there and there's a real team spirit. It's great value, too, at around eighty quid a night. The location is a bit of a trek in to town, but for such genuine hospitality and such lovely rooms I don't think you should care too much if you're south of 50 years old.

A top gaff which will get my custom again in the future.
",5,2006,07,24
211,"New, clean hotel with very helpful staff. The location? not terrible","As others have said, this is a very nice, new hotel. At 120 Euro/night or so, it seems a more than fair bargain.

We walked on a Friday night in July from the hotel to Temple Bar and the area around Dublin Castle. The walk takes about 20 to 30 minutes. The first 10 minutes is through a tatty neighborhood that is  fairly littered and dirty, but I saw nothing that leads me to think it dangerous. After that, it's a nice jaunt down McConnel street to the Liffey and to the more interesting areas.
",5,2006,07,23
211,"Great hotel, bad location","The hotel is beautiful and the staff is first rate.  I thought the location was bad because it is in a residential area but the hotel and staff make up for it.

211,Lovely Hotel.  Dont worry about location!,"Just returned from Dublin after a 2 night stay with my wife at Jury's Croke Park.  This hotel really does offer exceptional service and great value for money.  The decor is simple and contemporary with a few touches that really lift the overall design, namely the bar and reception area.  The rooms are clean, spacious and again nicely decorated.

As stated in previous posts the hotel is not right in the heart of the city but is only a 15/20 minute walk (6/7 euro cab ride) away, and this suited us perfectly. (Airport 15mins under 20 euros)

All the staff we encountered were very polite and helpful from the consierge to the waiting and housekeeping staff and this is what really made the difference during our stay.

The one slightly negative point I would make is to make sure you check what events are taking place at the Croke Park stadium, as a number of cabbies told me that roads in the area are a nightmare on match days.
",5,2006,06,29
211,Great Hotel! Great Location!,"I stayed at this hotel when it had only been open a couple of days! Wow it's very nice although our flat screen huge television didn't work we had come to town to see 50 cent in concert at the Point! It was beautiful inside the room fantastic and not all that expensive - would HIGHLY recommend and wouldn't hesitate in going back!
",5,2006,06,25
211,Best hotel in Dublin,"My boyfriend and I have just returned back from a fantastic weekend break in Dublin. The Jurys Croke Park Hotel was superb! 

We had an early morning flight and arrived at the hotel at 10am, although check-in at the hotel should have been 2pm, we were given our room immediately, a blessing after our early start! 

We booked directly with the hotel and got a great deal on an Executive Room, which I would definitely recommend as not only is the room bigger (king size bed etc.) and more luxurious, we had access to the Executive Lounge where there was a plasma screen, newspapers and complimentary tea, coffee, juices, danish pastries, croissants and fruit throughout the day. 

The rooms themselves were excellent, i would definitely agree with previous reviews about the bed ... definitely the best nights sleep i have ever had ! There was also a turn-down service and chocolates on our pillow every evening and fresh towels TWICE daily!  The service is excellent, concierge is on hand to give you all the info about the city. The buffet breakfast is also fantastic, everything catered for !  The location is great too, although you feel like you are in a very residential area, it is only a 15min walk into the centre and even a taxi back after an evening out is only about £5.

Although this hotel is advertised as 4star, the whole experience from the room, service, food is nothing less than 5star!! We will definitely be staying here on our next visit.
",5,2006,06,20
211,first class hotel,"We went to this hotel for my birthday in april, we only stayed two nights which is no where near enough to see all Dublin has to offer.
The hotel is around 15mins walk to o'connell street, I had read reviews before going and was a little worried about walking but it is fine a little run down but nothing more than in most city's.
 The rooms in this hotel are really very nice, bathrooms have shower and seperate bath which is a bit novel for a hotel. the food in the resturant was of a very high standard and there was a very good choice for breakfast. Staff are very helpful and able to arrange trips, tickets taxi's etc. 
Would recommend this hotel just check nothing is going on at Croke park when you plan to go, it may get a little busy and noisy if there is.
",5,2006,06,16
211,Best bed and bathroom!,"We stayed here as part of a tour group for 3 nights total. The hotel is very new and modern. Everything is bright and clean. The room was spotless and decorated very nicely. The best part of the room has got to be the beds! So comfy! They have down comforters and the bed feels like you're on a cloud. The bathrooms are very nice as well. Stand up glass shower and seperate tub. Plenty of space to store toileties and everything else. Large flat panel TV and large desk area as well. It has a small table in the corner with 1 chair. The desk has a leather roll chair. The view from our window was not great, but the hotel interior made up for that. Breakfast was very good and service was as well. The concierge here is great. We spoke with 3 different ones and they were extremely helpful and knowledgable about the area. The location of the hotel is a bit far away from city center. We did a day on the Hop On-Hop Off tourist bus and the walk to the first stop was only about 10 minutes. It was a straight line to walk, so no chance of getting lost. I would stay here again in a heartbeat!",5,2006,05,20
211,Great for business travellers!,"I stayed here during a week-long business trip, and I loved it! As someone else mentioned, the beds were the most comfortable I have ever slept on in a hotel. The rooms were brand-new and modern, the service was excellent, and the breakfast buffet very good.  I was also happy that they provided a shuttle to the business park where I had to go every day. The only downside is that the location was a bit dodgy. It was only a 20 minute walk for me (i'm slow) to downtown, but I wouldn't walk it after dark - take a taxi. Overall, a great place for business travellers and people attending the sports stadium accross the street.
",5,2006,05,19
211,A beautiful hotel,"We just returned from a tour of Ireland. We spent our first night here and our last 2 nights of the tour before returning to the states.  We were all very spoiled by this hotel. IT was the best of all!!  

A beautiful new hotel with just about every amenity you could want. The mattresses were the most comfortable of any I have slept on. The staff is exceedingly helpful. We had a problem with the room we were staying in and they immediately upgraded us to another and apologized profusely.

The breakfast is a buffet style and as someone mentioned a bit chaotic, but it was more than satisfactory for our needs. On our last night in Dublin, rather than go out, we ate at the hotel restaurant.  IT was FABULOUS. I had been waiting for a high quality dinner since we started our tour 8 days previously. Everyone kept asking where was the lamb Ireland was so famous for????  Well on my last night I found it at this hotel. It was delicious. The chef kept close eye on everyone in the restaurant. I watched him carefully and I think he knew it:-)

The only downfall to the hotel is the location. It is MORE than a 15 minute walk to downtown Dublin. We had to walk about 10 min. just to catch a local bus. We walked back from the Temple Bar area and it took a good hour. And the area we had to walk through was not the best.  It is a shame there is not some type of shuttle from the hotel. We could have taken a cab I suppose, but we will know better now.

I don't know what this area would be like when there is a sporting event or concert going on..probably pretty crazy, but I would definitely stay at this hotel again.
",4,2006,05,12
211,lovely hotel,"myself and boyfriend stayed at jurys croke park for two nights. We arrived at about 9am on the first day and was told check-in is usually 2pm, but they checked availability and let us check in there and then for no extra cost which was great. The room was big with a double and single bed, lovely flat screen tv, big bath, separate shower and iron and trouser press etc. The hotel is right opposite the stadium and from previous reviews I was a little concerned about the location, but need not have been. The walk to the city centre is 10-15 minutes and did not bother us at all. It was near enough to go round in the day time and then go back to the hotel and shower & change for the night time - we only got a taxi once and that was because we were very thirsty!!
We also went on the tour of croke park stadium which I would highly recommend - you get a discount if you say you are staying at the hotel. It was really interesting to learn more about the Irish history and also about the stadium itself - it is massive and we really enjoyed it. I would also say that the guinness storehouse was over-rated - we paid just over 12 euros each (web discount) to get in - we were given a guinness paperweight and a token to obtain a free pint - there did not seem to be an offical tour, we were told to walk around around the museum with a map. I would still say to go here, but just walk around the museum and when you get to the bar on the 5th floor, buy a pint of guinnes and walk up to the 7th floor gravity bar - much cheaper!!
But anyway, this hotel was great - friendly staff, lovely bed and also has a heated smoking area outside.

211,Great place to Stay,"We stayed at this hotel for two nights in April to celebrate our 49th wedding anniversary.  We were given a room upgrade to an executive room with access to the executive lounge.
The room was very comfortable and well equipped though the view from the window was a bit dreary.    Excellent bathroom with a walk-in shower as well as a bath and Judith Jackson toiletries.
Our newspaper didn't arrive nor did our promised Easter egg (we were on an Easter special package).     There was a generous buffet breakfast but service was a bit chaotic from staff who seemed to be under a lot of pressure.     Toast was underdone and the hot buffet wasn't really hot enough.   Hot breakfasts would be much better cooked to order.   Horrible little butter pats in foil also lose a few marks.
We dined in the restaurant one evening and had a very nice meal.    Service was much better than at breakfast.
There is no public transport close to the hotel and taxis to and from central Dublin cost about 10 euros.
Staff at the hotel were all very pleasant and helpful and we would definitely stay there again.

211,Fantastic,"Stayed for 3 nights (3 for price of 2 offer). Was impresssed before i even walked into the hotel. Staff very very friendly, checked into a fantastic room. Free toiletries, tea/coffee.

The bed has to be the most comfortable bed I have ever slept in! didnt want to get out! 
Had breakfast each morning which was fantastic. Either continental or full irish buffet. 

Would definately stay again. Fantastic experience all round

211,super super hotel,"Stayed in this hotel on the 18th April 2006.......read a few reviews regarding the location,  it took 10 minutes max to walk to O`Connells St where we caught the Hop on Hop off tour bus for a bit of sight seeing.  We ate in the resturant on the first night which was excellent was so nice to just relax and enoy our meal the staff were very friendly and helpful.  The room was very nice everything seemed so new and fresh the bathroom was big with both batha and seperate shower, tea and coffee facilities were available which were topped by house keeping.  The breakfast the next day was good with a wide selection of food available both hot and cold.  The front desk were very helpful in booking taxis and providing tour tickets before we left for the day..... overall after booking a very cheap deal to Dublin we could not have asked for more.

211,Good hotel - poor location for tourists,"The hotel is fine/good, a generic 4* in many ways, the rooms are comfortable with a deep bath and large shower, very clean etc etc.  The staff in the hotel were friendly and helpful, and while the restaurant food was good the service was appalling and it was a wee bit pricey for what you got.  The bar was great, loads of comfy seating, big screen TV showing sporting events, great staff, good quality & well priced bar food.  In terms of location it was walking distance to the shopping and sights if you have the inclination and comfy shoes - we walked it once and caught taxi's from then on.  One cab driver told us that the hotel was in a 'bit of a dodgy area' and to be careful at night - but we didn't come across anything to make us wary.  The hotel feels very safe and has good lift security (perhaps that is why?).  The location really is absolutely opposite the Croke Park Stadium and perfect if you're going to an event there, but be careful that you're not booked in when there's an event on that you're not attending as the roads directly around the hotel are closed and taxi's will be very hard to come by (again, according to one of the friendly cab drivers).

211,Nothing to fault - Excellent experience,"Spent a girls night here on 8th April.  Hotel very impressive and free car-parking (very few places you get that any more!) The rooms were lovely - absolutely everything you could imagine you need was there for your use.  Staff throughout the hotel were the last word in manners and professionalism.  Had our evening meal in-house and each of us thoroughly enjoyed our meal and again the service was excellent, warm and friendly.  Even though it was only an overnight stay, I left feeling thoroughly refreshed.  We all agreed we would definitely be back.  Well done to all concerned

Staff training must be excellent because I have never stayed anywhere that the staff at every level were so helpful & pleasant. The whole ambience of the hotel, the rooms, restaurant food etc were top class. Well done to all concerned..
",5,2006,04,11
211,Excellent,"I must echo the comments of others that have stayed here, this is a stylish, clean, comfortable and modern hotel.

Compared to many of the other offerings in and around Dublin this place was terrific value for money. The rooms were spotless, well furnished and modern, the beds were extremely comfortable and we got very little noise from adjacent rooms.

Anyone used to living in or being around a large city will be comfortable with the short (15 minute) walk into town . . . . . it's no worse than walking in any residential area of London for instance!!

Would stay here again and recommend to others without hesitation!!

Note: One small tip for those (like me) not used to staying in such modern hotels. Don’t take anything out of the mini bar unless you intend to consume it . . . . I made the mistake of surveying the champagne and had a hard time getting it taken off the bill (there are sensors in the mini bar to bill you automatically for anything you take out) . . . . you have been warned ;-)

211,gorgoeous hotel,"The hotel is gorgeous, contemporary design, chocolate and cream bedrooms with suede and chrome, flat screen TV, walk in shower and the most comfortable bed I have ever slept in!  Extremely high standard of cleanlines throughout hotel.  Not only does it look good it smells good too! The breakfast was excellent, good choice of freshly cooked, cereal, fruit, yoghurt, juices, ham, cheese.  The staff, in particular Mark, Assistant Manager, couldn't do enough to make you feel welcome.  I booked through Superbreak and got 3 nights (1 night free), double room with breakfast for only 187 pounds! The only down side is that the hotel is about 10-15 mins walk away from the city centre and you have to walk through quite a run down area, we got a taxi for 7 euro, I would recommend you do this.  Would definately stay here again.

211,Great Hotel - Good Location.,"I stayed in Jury's Croke Park for three nights and thought it was a really great hotel.  The staff were pleasant and helpful, and the room was really impressive.  The location is only about a 15-minute walk from O'Connell St and is a better choice than staying somewhere like Temple Bar (I'm speaking from experience!!).  Can't recommend it enough and will definitely be staying there the next time I'm in Dublin.

211,Impressive,"Stayed the weekend of the 3rd and 4th of February. Hotel is contemporary but very welcoming. Bar has large impressive feature fire and cleverly designed screen showing major events. Dined in the Bistro on the first evening. Food delicious (try the cannon of lamb!)and staff very friendly and efficient. Bedrooms were the most impressive, best nights sleep I have ever had, so much so that I have purchased a bed from the supplier today. Underfloor heating in bathrooms a nice touch. Walked into the main shopping area on Saturday, took approximately 15 minutes. Booked to go again in April.

i did have a few problems when i stayed though, i never recieved my wake-up call and so was late for an appointment in the city, also no newspaper and the bath worked the opposite to how it should have, which ended up with me burning myself!

We were very impressed with the friendly helpful staff, at the front desk, and the cleanliness of the hotel.  The bedroom was very spacious, with two double beds, and a single bed.  The bathroom had bath, plus seperate shower, and the underfloor heating created great comfort.  The breakfast was excellent, and offered great choice.  There is so much to do in Dublin, we were disappointed that our stay wasnt longer.  We have recommended Jurys to several of our friends, and we hope to go back again some time.

211,Great Hotel,"My boyfriend and I stayed at Croke park hotel in October 2005. I loved this hotel. It was modern, clean, and service was fantastic. Best of all was the heated bathroom floors! I loved this feature. The rooms were clean and the beds in of the most comfortable in the 5 places we stayed in through out Ireland. This is a very modern, secure hotel. You need your key to access the elevators, get in and out of the garage, and keep your lights in your room turned on. Yep that is what I said to keep your lights in your room turned on you slide your key into a little slot. If you don’t do this, your lights will turn off in about 10 minutes. It is also good because you always know where your key is.
The walk to Temple bar is about 15-20 minutes. I never felt like I was in danger. Granted there are not as many streetlights as downtown, but just because it was a little dark I did not feel I was going to be jumped at any moment. Also if you are going to anything at Croke Park Stadium it is directly across the street. Parking is included with your stay at the hotel; it is in a very well lit, secure parking garage. Do like I did just park your car while in Dublin and walk.
The front desk people were extremely helpful and when I had a problem with my bill from the previous stay a week earlier (travel agent mistake not theirs) they corrected the problem and I had no problem with them returning the amount. They also recommended a place to eat that was open late. Indian food. I did not expect the front desk people to remember my name seeing that this is a modern hotel and all, but they did. Upon returning from dinner they asked how it was and then told me it was their favorite place to eat in Dublin and they ate there at least 1 a month.
The one lower point is the breakfast. I was not impressed and the amount I had to pay I thought was a little high. It was not a bad meal, just nothing special.
Heated floors!! Yeah

211,"Lovely Hotel, Awful Location for Tourists","This is a new hotel so it is absolutely beautiful.  It has the nicest, friendliest and most helpful staff I have ever come across in a hotel, especially Sandra on reception.  Rooms are lovely - widescreen LCD tv, air conditioning, beautiful bathrooms with fantastic separate bath and shower.  Internet access, desk and office chair.  Nice recliner too.  Shower is large - plenty of room to move around.  Executive rooms are worth the EUR20 extra - you get a much bigger bed, bathrobes and access to executive lounge.

Restaurant is nice - food is ok.  I've stayed here 3 times so far and the quality varies.  The Irish maitre d' is fantastic - warm welcome and professional.  The Eastern European one is cool and aloof - shouted (literally) after me that I hadn't signed my bill, when I had.  Only bit of attitude I came across in this hotel.

Beautiful bar with huge TV screen over an amazing fire.  Complimentary newspapers.  Nice Guinness.  Average Irish coffees.

There is a gym also. 

But if you are coming to this hotel from outside Ireland, be careful.  I know Dublin and this hotel is NOT in a great area.  North of it is fine - Drumcondra is a nice suburb of Dublin.  South of it is tough north inner city Dublin - check out the council houses over the canal.  Very rough area.  I personally would not walk in this neighbourhood during the day never mind at night.  Get a taxi.  It should cost EUR7 into the city and is worth it.  On the plus side, the hotel is 10 seconds walk from Croke Park so the BEST location if you are going to a match or concert there.

Despite all this, I would recommend this hotel.  They're offering good deals at the moment  because it's new.  So use the money you save to GET A TAXI!

211,"A nice hotel, a distance from city center.","We stayed at this hotel Oct. 20-24, 2005. The establishment was finished and the staff very courteous and helpful. The hotel was very nice with many nice amenities. Unless you're staying in a room at the front of the building with a view of Croke Park across the street, the views are not worth looking out the window. The hotel is further from city center than the adverts would suggest. We had no problem getting around using public transport (bus, DART and Suburban rail, taxi) however. We didn't eat at the hotel, choosing to dine locally instead. One disappointment was the charge for ""in room broadband internet"". We did enjoy our stay here as we got an excellent deal during their opening, but would probably choose an establishment more centrally located next time.

211,Love Jurys,"Stayed at this hotel for our 25th Wedding anniversary 16th -20th October.  Were given a room with king sized bed, loved the under floor heating in bathroom, beds turned down every night with bathrobes and chocolates left for us on the bed.  No problems at all during our stay except could do with a waste bin in the bathroom and when lying in the bath you tend to be gazing at the underneath of the sink, bad design on someones part. The maid changed our towels every morning and night.  The hotel is situated opposite Croke Park stadium (well worth a visit) and in an industrial park area, but we walked back to the hotel every night 20-25 minutes from Temple Bar and did not have any problems, there is students accommodation not far and also a Police Station so although area might look run down we did not feel threatened or uncomfortable in any way.  Taxi from airport cost 25 euros and is worth not having the hassle.  We paid £47 a night for the room it was a special offer and must admit had a very good deal.  The hotel is new and modern and we could not fault anything.  Patrick one of the porters is really helpful and all the staff were friendly.  We only had a bar meal there at lunch time, the burger was lovely.  If you want a great place to eat go to The Shack in Temple Bar opposite Temple Bar Hotel great food, also the Arlington Hotel alongside the Liffey O'connell Street side great irish food carvery not too expensive and good entertainment every night, but you need to reserve a table if you want to go in the evening.  Musical Pub Crawl is worth a try but avoid going to see Book of Kells, bit of a rip off. I would recommend this hotel if you don't mind the exercise.

211,A Few Teething Problems,"We stayed in this hotel 19th - 21st Sept, it had only opened on the 8th Sept, so I thought 'great, brand new hotel'.
This is a lovely hotel, very smart, we didn't see or hear any continuing building work, it seemed finished to me.
There were a few teething problems which the staff sorted out and we got our meal, in the restaurant, on the house.
It wasn't too much of a walk into the city centre, but not as close as stated in the information about the hotel. We caught a bus from the airport and it was a bit of a walk from the bus stop to the hotel.
Very smart bar area with a big projection tv screen at one end.
Helpful staff.
Even though we had two or three problems, we would stay at this hotel again.

211,"Give it a few more months, and don't go out walking alone!","We stayed here from 21-23 September, about two weeks after it opened. 

First things first, this hotel is NOT a ten minute walk from town, as it is advertised. It is in the middle of a pretty rough area of Dublin, and it's a ten minute walk to the nearest bus stop or at least a twenty minute walk to the top of O Connell Street, and you wouldn't want to walk it alone or at night! 

Our problems with this hotel started before we even arrived! We went to Dublin for my birthday, and my partner thought it would be a nice surprise to organise flowers and champagne in the room for when we arrived. He phoned the hotel and they said it wasn't the sort of thing they could do. Yet, when we arrived at the hotel there is a brochure in the room saying you just have to ask the porters if you want flowers delivered. I emailed Jurys to ask about something else, and didn't even get a response. 

We were suitably impressed when we arrived - once you get inside you can forget the area the hotel is in as the entrance is very imposing. 

We had booked a double room so were somewhat surprised to find a single bed in the room in addition to a pretty small double, but the bathroom was good, with a bath and walk in shower. The rooms were ok, but not as good as you would expect for a 4* hotel. The website and the brochure in the room talk about every room having a stereo but we were informed by reception, when we queried where ours was, that they hadn't actually arrived yet. 

Not being quite finished seemed to be a theme with this hotel. There seemed to be lots of random banging and work still going on, which only stopped in early evening after we complained for the third time. 

There was a spectacular view of a building site from our window, and be warned, if you are in a room at the back you will be woken up by the laundry truck at 5am. 

On our first night we were shattered from travelling so decided to have something light to eat in the bar (the hotel has two places to eat - this and the restaurant/bistro). The food here was good, once you managed to get served, which was verging on impossible! 

On our last night it wasn't such a sucess story! We decided to eat in the restaurant and went down there at about 8pm, only to be told that as we hadn't made a dinner reservation IN OUR OWN HOTEL, we couldn't eat. We complained to reception and the sales manager managed to sort out that we could have a meal from the restaurant but we were seated in a deserted side room. 

We noticed that the menu we were handed looked the same as the bar menu we had selected from on our first night and when we queried it we were told that there was a function in the restaurant that night and that everyone who wasn't part of it was being served from the bar menu. So why not tell us this in the first place?! 

To be fair to the hotel they wiped £30 off our bill and recommended a restaurant in town which was excellent, but it was a lot of hassle we didn't need and, with everything else included, it didn't make for a very relaxing break! 

We booked on Lastminute.com so we got a pretty good deal, but not a lot less than what everyone else pays. I don't really feel like we got what we paid for, and I hope all Jurys Hotels aren't like that!

A place to return",5,2024,06,21
211,"Excellent hotel, excellent waitresses","The hotel is very well decorated and elegant, both the rooms and the lounges, although due to the location it is quite far from the center of Dublin. It makes up for this by being a clean, pleasant hotel, the breakfast is quality and the treatment with the staff is excellent, especially with the waitresses. 
At night Fiona served us, a person with exquisite treatment and overflowing with sympathy.

211,Recommended hotel,"The service has been unbeatable, there were many workers who spoke Spanish and they made the experience more comfortable for us, the room service is attentive and the meal times are very good, they also gave us a taxi to pick us up from the airport. It is near the center of downtown.
In particular, thank you for the attention received by Jhoana, it has made us feel very comfortable.",5,2024,05,13

211,Excellent restaurant!!,"The restaurant is extraordinary, cozy and very pretty with its decoration. The service is excellent, particularly by Miss Jhoana who is very friendly, helpful and always attentive to the diners. It is a great option for dinner..",5,2024,05,08
211,100% recommended,"The treatment of the workers is magnificent, the breakfasts are very good and safe for celiacs, the rooms are spacious and comfortable. There are Spanish staff (lovely) and everyone is very helpful, attentive and friendly, they help you with everything. The rooms are clean, we don't usually like hotels with carpets in the rooms because of the issue of mites and the difficult cleaning, but in this hotel the cleaning is correct.",5,2024,04,04
211,Surprise,"Very good buffet breakfast, it is very complete and quite good, the food is also quite good.
Prices are good
The place is nice, the staff is very friendly, they have very good local beer among other drinks. Personally I would stay again, very good option to stay.",5,2024,03,28
211,The best bar in an excellent hotel,"Great hotel with a good location. The rooms are very cozy and clean. You can walk to the center and it is located in front of a sports stadium. The best thing about the hotel was the bar, especially a very attentive waiter who treated us wonderfully, Gonzalo, a crack!",5,2024,03,15
211,Good hotel good service,"The hotel staff have been charming, 10. The rooms were perfect, very hot, of course, we had to turn off the heating every day. Breakfast a 10. The bar service is very good, also the waiters and the normal prices. The quiet and welcoming reception rooms, to relax and have a quiet drink",5,2024,03,13
211,Excellent hotel,"Excellent hotel, everything very comfortable, mainly you sleep great, the pillows and mattress are very good, 20 minutes walk from the center but it is worth it, we were lucky to be assisted by Mirla at the reception, always friendly and attentive, I would recommend the hotel without hesitation",5,2024,03,10
211,"Pure relaxation and great service, also quite centrally located","The staff is so friendly and dedicated. The reception at reception was very warm. We arrived two hours early and were still able to move into our room. We had also forgotten our socket adapter and they lent us one. Then we asked for a late check-out, which was granted to us at no extra charge, and we were allowed to keep the room for 1.5 hours longer.
Overall, the interior of the hotel is super nice, there are an incredible number of seating areas and corners. The breakfast is also sensationally good. Lots of choice, beautifully presented and used dishes are cleared away very quickly.
The rooms are also beautifully furnished. The bed is super comfortable, there is enough storage space and shelves. There are an incredible number of sockets and lamps and a huge TV with Sky reception. Every day you get 0.5 liters of still water per person, as well as tea, coffee, cocoa, sugar and milk and biscuits.
There is a great bathroom with a bath and shower. You get shampoo, shower gel and body lotion every day. Two large towels, two normal towels and two small ones. The cleaning staff are super thorough. They even took out my empty shower gel in the shower and put new one right there for me, that's what I call world class service and it absolutely put a smile on my face.
The hotel is close to a train station and bus stops, it's a 20 minute bus ride to the airport and a 30 minute train ride to the coast in Howth. It's about a 5 minute walk to the stops. It's a 15-20 minute walk into town.
We will definitely be back because relaxation is a priority here.",5,2024,02,14
211,Excellent,"Excellent treatment from Jorge, Adan and Federico, they made the stay much more pleasant, the cocktails they recommended to us were very, very good, excellent grades and quality, the attention was extraordinary from the first moment we arrived. I would definitely repeat. 10/10",5,2024,01,16
211,A wonderful hotel,"The treatment of all the staff was excellent, but I must emphasize that of Jorge, Adam and Federico, it is always a pleasure to be served by people like that! The hotel is spectacular in every sense, the spacious and extremely comfortable rooms have everything you need for your stay.",5,2024,01,16
211,Quality hotel and good service,I loved the hotel. Very good service and quality. It is close to the center but if you have been walking all day it is better to take a taxi on the way back. Very good experience. The cleaners are wonderful as are the rest of the reception staff.,5,2023,12,07
211,Excellent hotel,"Truly exceptional courtesy and helpfulness. The restaurant is good, with typical and international dishes. Excellent internal parking connected by lift. For us, the connection to the airport, Howth and the center was simple.",5,2023,08,22
211,Excelente trato,"Excelente servicio y comida, destacar la amabilidad de l@s trabajadores en general y en concreto de Milena, Adrián y Blanca, encantadores todos ellos. Muy buen ambiente y gente muy abierta, seguro volveremos.",5,2023,05,01
211,Ottimo sotto tutti gli aspetti,"Soggiorno assolutamente in linea con le aspettative. Ottima la colazione, stanze grandi e pulitissime. Grande attenzione al cliente e personale molto disponibile. Ottima posizione, con 10 minuti a piedi sei in pieno centro. Assolutamente consigliato",5,2023,04,26
211,Empfehlung für einen kurzen Aufenthalt,"Location in Ordnung, die Entfernung zur Stadtmitte ca. 20 min zu Fuß. Zimmer waren schon in Ordnung. Badezimmer ziemlich sauber. Die Zimmer könnten allerdings größere Fenster haben.  
Mitarbeiter waren ganz nett. Wir hatten gerade einen Tag erwischt, an dem im Stadium gegenüber Fußballspiele stattfanden, daher war das Hotel am ersten Abend rappelvoll von Fußballfans. Ansonsten ziemlich ruhig.",4,2023,04,07
211,Ci piacerebbe tanto tornarci!!,"Siamo stati davvero bene. Innanzitutto al nostro arrivo abbiamo trovato una ragazza spagnola che sapeva un po' di italiano e quindi per noi è stato più facile, appena arrivati. 
Le nostre camere erano spaziose e comode. È stato un viaggio di famiglia ed eravamo 6 adulti e 2 bambine divisi in 2 camere e siamo stati molto bene.
Il bagno era anche meglio di quanto mi aspettassi. Aveva sia la doccia che la vasca, nella quale mi sono goduta un bel bagno caldo dopo aver camminato molto durante il giorno, e dopo essere stati al vento freddo di Howth. L'unica ""pecca"" che potrei trovare è il fatto che non ci sia una nappa mobile. Per il resto tutto più che perfetto, una bella mensola dove poter appoggiare le proprie cose e un assortimento di ottimi prodotti di cortesia. 
In camera poi avevamo a disposizione un bollitore con diversi prodotti (tè, caffè, camomilla, etc.) e due bottiglie di acqua.
I letti, anche se non grandissimi, erano comodi.",5,2023,02,28
211,Alice Pérez Ruiz,"Excellent hotel with all the comforts and wonderful breakfast. Staff very kind. Para los españoles, el hotel no está del todo mal comunicado con el centro. Se puede llegar tranquilamente caminando aunque se tarda unos 15 minutos. Merece la pena alojarse aquí puesto que la comunicación con el aeropuerto sí es muy buena. El autobús Aircoach 700 tiene una parada en Drumcondra que está a tan sólo 6 minutos del hotel a pie. Las instalaciones para descansar tras un largo día son una maravilla, con chimenea y mucho, mucho confort. En el desayuno hay buffet pero los cafés y tostadas se sirven de cocina. Todo un lujo. Lo recomiendo 100%",5,2023,01,04
211,Bastante bien,"Todo muy limpio, las camas muy cómodas, el desayuno es mejorable pero está bien, la recepcionista Irlandesa a pesar de pedirle que hablara más lento le dio igual y siguió hablando a toda pastilla que no se le entendía nada, aunque te vas a encontrar alguna recepcionista y camarera  española, muy majas. Si se te olvida llevar adaptador de enchufe no te preocupes, el enchufe del baño sirve aunque no lo parezca. La situación está bien si no quieres estar en el centro total con el bullicio pero en 15/20 minutos paseando llegas al centro. Además, si no quieres gastarte muchos dinero en transporte, desde el aeropuerto en zona 15 coges bus 41 (aunque en la marquesina pone que cuesta 3 euros realmente son 2,60 euros y tienes que tener el dinero exacto, no devuelven) y en la parada Drumcondra Rd con Drumcondra Station, te deja por la parte de atrás del hotel en 25 minutos aprox. (en el bus te va indicando en la pantalla las paradas, no hace falta preguntar) y en 7 minutos andando como mucho estás en el hotel. Luego cuando te vayas y quieras volver al aeropuerto, tanto el bus 41 como el 16 te llevan desde cualquier altura de la calle Drumcondra. Recomendado el restaurante italiano que hay en la misma acera del hotel un poquito más arriba. ",5,2022,11,10
211,Visita familiar,"El hotel está muy bien, quizás un poco alejado del centro, caminando unos veinte minutos. No llegamos a utilizar la piscina ni el gimnasio. El desayuno un poco caro. La habitación si está completa y ofrecen unas botellas de agua de cortesía.",4,2022,11,07
211,Estancia excelente,"Un hotel excelente por su buen trato, amabilidad, limpieza y servicio.

El desayuno espectacular, muy completo y variado, con un trato humano increíble.

Bien ubicado, y una relación calidad precio muy buena.",5,2022,10,16
211,FANTASTICO,Ottimo hotel con eccellente rapporto qualità prezzo. Hall spaziosa e elegante. Camere accoglienti e pulite. Saloni comuni ampi e vari. Colazione abbondante con molte varietà. A 20 minuti a piedi dal centro città. Possibilità di parcheggio a pagamento. Molto consigliato.,5,2022,09,06
211,Hotel recomendable,"El hotel nos pareció muy bonito, con una decoración muy cuidada. Las camas muy, muy cómodas, la habitación muy confortable. 
Lo que quizás menos nos gustó fue el entorno del hotel, el barrio no es muy bonito. Tampoco que hubiera que avisar en recepción cuando queríamos que limpiaran la habitación, en España es algo que hacen a diario en hoteles de 4 estrellas.
El desayuno muy bueno.",4,2022,07,22
211,BBQ Irlandese,"In un gazebo esterno di questo hotel abbiamo provato l'esperienza del BBQ Irlandese. Carne grigliata sul momento, ingredienti disponibili per comporre il proprio panino, insalate e verdure più una buona scelta di dolci. Eravamo un gruppo di una cinquantina di persone ed hanno faticato a stare dietro alla nostra voracità quindi dopo che le prime persone si sono servite le altre hanno dovuto aspettare un po'.
Nonostante la giornata decisamente non primaverile, ad un certo punto hanno aperto la copertura del gazebo facendoci prendere un freddo cane fino a quando non li abbiamo convinti a richiuderla.
Fiumi di birre per tutta la serata",4,2022,05,28
211,Buona struttura,"Ottima accoglienza, camera grande e pulita, ampio bagno con vari asciugamani e set di cortesia. In camera bollitore e macchina con acqua e ghiaccio al piano. 
Unico neo la moquette nella stanza e non proprio vicino al centro della città.",4,2022,05,24
211,HOTEL OTTIMO,"Ho soggiornato in questo hotel per tre giorni , in compagnia di mia figlia ed altri parenti.
L'hotel si trova poco lontano dal centro città , con fermate di bus poco distanti, è posizionato a fianco del celebre stadio.
Raggiungibile in circa 20 minuti dall'aeroporto.
Camere ampie e pulite, bagno pulito con doccia spaziosa.
Colazioni da pagare a parte ma molto abbondanti e con un'ampia varietà di scelta di cibi buoni.
Personale della reception molto cordiale.
La posizione della mia camera consentiva di dormire tranquillamente, infatti non c'erano rumori di notte.
Lo consiglio vivamente a coloro che vogliono visitare Dublino.",5,2022,05,18
211,Muy recomendable para ir en familia,"La verdad es que la experiencia ha sido muy bueno, muy buena atención por todo el personal y las habitaciones para ir con familia muy bien. Éramos 2 adultos + 2 adolescentes y la habitación está muy bien, las camas de 1,40 y los colchones muy cómodos.

Muy poco ruido del pasillo y el baño muy bien.

Como mejora la ducha tendría que tener una alcachofa de mano y que no fuera fija, sobre todo para los niños y lavarse mejor el pelo.

El desayuno bastante bien, si bien tendría que dar la opción de tostar pan y que no fuera solo pan de molde, además el bacon no nos gusto.

La wifi funcionaba muy bien.",4,2022,04,05
211,Gutes Hotel mit exzellentem Personal,"Schönes modernes Hotel das direkt am berühmten Croke Park liegt. Aber nicht sehr zentral.
Die Zimmer sind relativ modern eingerichtet und sauber. Die Executive Lounge lohnt sich aktuell noch nicht, aber wenn der Betrieb wieder hochfährt ist es sicherlich ein angenehmes Feature.
Das größte Plus des Hotels ist jedoch das tolle Team. Man ist stets bedacht dem Gast einen wunderschönen Aufenthalt zu bereiten . Sei es am Front Desk oder im Restaurant oder in der Bar. Diese Menschen machen den Aufenthalt wirklich zu einem schönen Erlebnis. Besonderst der Front Desk Manager Mr. Lewandowski ist in allen Belangen ein herausragender Mitarbeiter.
Das Frühstück ist full Irish aktuell. Welches sehr gut ist, aber bei einem längeren Aufenthalt dann doch monoton werden kann. Aber auch hier wird sich in der nahen Zukunft noch etwas ändern. Als Discovery Status Member wird man hier bestens behandelt und bekommt alle zum Level gehörenden Benefits ohne nochmal Nachfragen zu müssen.
Alles im Allem ist es ein Hotel das eine ausgezeichnete Preis Leistung bietet und ich werde gerne wieder in dieses Haus kommen.
PS: An Wochenenden wo im Stadion gespielt wird kann es sehr busy werden mit Fans der jeweiligen Mannschaft. Aber man ist dann im Hotel an einer wirklich lebendigen Bar.
",4,2022,02,08
211,Ottima sistemazione,Hotel di livello con accoglienza molto cordiale e professionale.  Alla reception personale disponibile per qualsiasi cosa. Pulizia al top. Camera per tre spaziosa con bagno molto comodo . Non abbiamo provato il ristorante nè la colazione.  In camera disponibilità di bollitore e macchinetta nespresso con scorta di tè caffè e latte. Abbiamo usufruito di 3 consumazioni a gratis al bar. È un pò lontano dalla zona centrale (20' a piedi) ma con servizio taxi e bus nelle si raggiungono i maggiori luoghi d'interesse in 10'/15',5,2021,12,01
211,"Aceptable, pero caro","Estuvimos la familia tres días en dos habitaciones para visitar a nuestros hijos que estaban estudiando en Irlanda. La recepción y la entrada estaban muy bonitas porque eran fechas cercanas a Navidad. 
Os recomendamos reservar el desayuno porque nosotros no lo hicimos y bajamos a las diez sin reserva y aun habiendo mesas libres nos hicieron esperar, así que nos fuimos a un café Kale a cinco minutos de allí y desayunamos de fábula todos los días. 
El gimnasio está muy bien, amplio y bien equipado. 
Nos llamó la atención que se permite a los huéspedes dejar las bandejas con restos de sus cenas en el suelo del pasillo, con vasos de zumos derramados manchando la moqueta. 
Tardaron un día en retirarlas y en “limpiar” la moqueta del pasillo. 
Además los pasillos eran fríos. 
La habitación bien, buena tele y buenas almohadas. 
Si no pedías que te hicieran la habitación no te la hacían, cosa que nos sorprendió para un cuatro estrellas. 
La zona, está a un paseo del centro pero es un barrio algo deprimido. 
El servicio de habitaciones, bien. 
En general, hotel caro para la calidad que se ofrece.",3,2021,11,29
211,Estupendo hotel,"Estupenda habitación, excelente comida en su restaurant y excepcional servicio del personal, especialmente Kent H, quien se esforzó inclusive en hablarnos en español.
Solicitamos habitación triple y realmente cumplió en tamaño y comodidad.",5,2020,01,22
211,Fin de año en el hotel,"Hemos pasado unos amigos el fin de año en el hotel donde reservamos una magnifica cena y despues disfrutamos de una fiesta con música en directo. Quiero resaltar la profesionalidad y amabilidad de todo el equipo que trabaja en el hotel, destacando a Patricia y Alejandro, que ademas de hacer perfecto su trabajo nos ayudaron con el idioma. He de añadir que las instalaciones son fabulosas. Recomiendo este hotel sin ninguna duda.",5,2020,01,01
211,Sehr angenehm und freundlich,"Fußläufig gelegen, mit eigenem Parkplatz und sehr schön ausgestatteten Zimmern. Wir hatten die Executive Etage und konnten so auch ein inkludiertes Frühstück in einer kleinen Lounge genießen, das nur die warmen Bestandteile des recht teuren Full breakfast nicht enthält.
Das Personal war sehr freundlich, die abendliche Bar prima und die Duschutensilien haben besonders gut gerochen. Das habe ich noch nie geschrieben, war aber so.... Das Doppelbett ist allerdings nicht das Breiteste...
Dennoch sehr zu empfehlen.",4,2019,12,31
211,Ottima struttura!!!,"Un albergo confortevole che consiglio senza dubbio. Camere ampie, moderne e pulite. Staff disponibile. Tanti servizi: phon, ferro da stiro, dispenser acqua e macchina del ghiaccio al piano, adattatori, tv grande e moderno, tante asciugamani a disposizione, prodotti per il bagno. Ottimo per famiglie.",5,2019,12,30
211,4* non piene ,"L'albergo si presenta molto bene, ingresso molto ampio e invitante. La nostra stanza era molto grande spaziosa, però,  a guardarla più attentamente, mancava un po' di manutenzione: Carta da parati un po' scollata, muffa in zona piatto doccia e infine il lavandino perdeva acqua. La colazione molto abbondante e varia. Il personale tutto gentilissimo. Non è vicinissimo al centro: 20/30 min a piedi ",4,2019,10,14
211,4 stelle senza asciugacapelli,"Un hotel 4 stelle non può non offrire un asciugacapelli.
Per il resto, nella norma per un 4 stelle: pulizia buona, camera con due letti molto comodi (nella prenotazione avevamo richiesto un matrimoniale), colazione irlandese e continentale",4,2019,09,16
211,Perfektes Hotel,"Sehr Stadthotel in Stadtrandlage, direkt gegenüber vom Sport Stadion, allerdings ist die Stadt in 15 Minuten fußläufig gut zu erreichen. Das Frühstücksbuffet ist sehr gut und ausreichend, es es werden Tageszeitung angeboten. Der Frühstücksraum ist sehr hell und lädt Zum verweilen und lesen ein.

211,Buon Hotel,"La location forse non è il punto più forte, poiché si trova a circa 2 km dal centro.. Cmq facendo un po' di strada a piedi si arriva facilmente alle fermate dei vari bus che portano in città.
Camera molto spaziosa, avevamo una twin con 2 letti di una piazza e mezza. Buoni anche i prodotti da bagno. Staff preparato anche se non mi è piaciuto il fatto che, al momento del check in, non sia stato informato del fatto che lo scomparto del minibar era bloccato e che sarebbe stato reso accessibile solo dopo aver depositato la propria carta di credito (andava bene ma bisognava dirlo!).
Su richiesta la reception fornisce anche gli adattatori, indispensabili per caricare i nostri amati telefoni :)",4,2019,08,03

211,Lejos pero te acercan ,"El único pero del hotel es que no está en el centro es necesario transporte para todo 
Pero la amabilidad del personal la limpieza habitaciones y todo tipo de necesidades (algo nadas toallas ....)las cumplen 
El desayuno es de buena calidad y merece la pena cogerlo zumo rico y desgustscion de tostadas en mesa
Muy amables con los niños
Tienen el bus turístico disponible en su puerta para llevarte al centro las primeras horas 9 y 9:30 merece la pena y te hacen oferta allí con algo de descuento ",4,2018,10,14
211,Ein rundum gelungener City trip,"Ein perfektes Hotel um Dublin zu entdecken. Genau gegenüber dem Croke Park Stadium. Die Innenstadt ist leicht zu Fuß zu erreichen. Das Hotel ist sehr sauber und gut eingerichtet. Das Personal ist sehr aufmerksam und hilfsbereit. Der Hammer ist der Concierge Service. Er versucht alles möglich zu machen, bucht vorher reservierte Tickes um, organisiert Ausflüge und fährt einem sogar noch hinterher wenn man etwas vergessen hat. So etwas haben wir bisher noch nicht erlebt. Das ist gelebter Service. Preislich ist das Hotel für Dubliner Verhältnisse vollkommen in Ordnung. Jederzeit gerne wieder.",5,2018,10,01
211,"Buen hotel, regular ubicación","El hotel  está muy bien en líneas generales, moderno, agragable decoración.
La habitación resultó cómoda, y la zona silenciosa.

Bien el desayuno",4,2018,09,26
211,Buen lugar,"Adecuada atención, mantenimiento e instalaciones adecuados. Servicio que puede mejorar pero buena cocina, con buena calidad de alimentos y bien localizado. Un lugar que vale la pena para hospedarse cuando estén en Irlanda.",4,2018,09,20
211,Perfekt für einen Städtetrip - sehr gute Airport Anbindung,"Das Hotel liegt am grössten Stadion Irlands dem Croke Park. Mit dem Aircoach (Bus 700) sind es nur 20 Minuten vom und zum Airport. Die Haltestelle liegt 10 Minuten vom Hotel entfernt an der Drumcondra Road. Die City (O´Connell Street) ist fussläufig in etwa 25 Minuten zu erreichen. Mit dem Bus ist es etwas kompliziert (mit 1x umsteigen), weshalb wir immer zu Fuss gegangen sind. Das Hotel macht oberflächlich einen sehr eleganten und modernen Eindruck. Aber auch hier ist natürlich nicht alles Gold was glänzt. Obwohl unser Zimmer sehr gross, elegant und sauber war, konnte das Bad da nicht mithalten. Hier und da gab es abgeplatzte Stellen im Waschbecken oder auch in der Dusche, die übrigens vom Wasserdruck eher mässig war. Eine Klobürste fehlte völlig. Den Fön haben wir erst nach langem Suchen in einer unauffälligen Schublade im Zimmer gefunden - ein kleiner Aufkleber mit einem Hinweis wäre da hilfreich. Das Frühstück ist allerdings absolut klasse. Es gibt kalte und warme Speisen. Sonderwünsche (Capuccino statt Kaffee, Omletts etc.) werden gerne und kostenlos erfüllt. Der Orangensaft ist offensichtlich frisch gepresst und gut gekühlt (was man zusammen sehr selten antrifft). Etwas schade, fanden wir es, dass man von einer Servicekraft plaziert wird und sich seinen Platz nicht selber aussuchen kann. Besonders hervorzuheben ist die nette Atmosphäre im Hotel. Jeder Mitarbeiter schenkt einem ein freundliches Lächeln und ist hilfsbereit. Als wir ausgecheckt haben, hat man uns zum Abschied noch mit 2 Halbliterflaschen kostenlosem Mineralwasser - für den Weg - versorgt. Wir würden auf jeden Fall wieder hier buchen.",4,2018,09,06
211,Complimenti ,"Hotel di livello alto, belle le camere, e gli arredi. Le aree comuni sono ampie e accoglienti. Il particolare caminetto e il mega schermo, completano l’opera. Molto pulito e curato ovunque, le stanze sono ineccepibili. Il personale cordiale , disponibile e molto professionale, rendono il soggiorno gradevole. La distanza dal centro è ragionevole (20 minuti a piedi). Certamente tornerò in questo hotel 👍",5,2018,08,28
211,Bella struttura un po’ periferica ma bel collegata,"Siano stati una notte in questo hotel scelto per l’ottimo rapporto qualità prezzo. La struttura è bellissima. Le camere spazio è molto pulite con vasca e doccia in camera. Unico neo (per noi) i letti molto alti e con materassi poco rigidi. Ottima la colazione, abbondantissima e con servizio eccellente al tavolo. La struttura è un po’ periferica ma si raggiunge facilmente con cinque minuti a  piedi dalle diverse fermate per il bus del centro che dista all’incirca (6/9 fermate) con un viaggio di 10/15 minuti a seconda del traffico. Comunque ottimo hotel",4,2018,08,18
211,Super,"Das Hotel befindet sich direkt neben dem Croke Park Stadium, das Stadtzentrum ist in ca. 30 Minuten fußläufig zu erreichen. Das Personal ist sehr freundlich, die Zimmer ausreichend groß und sehr sauber.",5,2018,08,05
211,Hotel muy recomendable,"El hotel es moderno y muy confortable. La atención es excelente en todos los servicios y son muy amables y educados. La limpieza de los cuartos es de las mejores que hemos tenido.
Los cuartos son amplios y los baños tienen ducha y bañera separados, muy cómodos. Reponen todos los días los productos de baño.
Realmente es un placer volver al cuarto después de todo un día de trajín. 
El desayuno está bien.
Con respecto a la ubicación, es verdad que no está en el centro y el lugar no es muy pintoresco, enfrente hay un gran estadio. Pero caminar hasta el centro está bueno para conocer y enseguida se llega a la zona animada. A la vuelta, de noche recomiendo tomar taxi, nosotros éramos 5 adultos y nos salía unos 14 euros y son seguros. ",4,2018,07,26
211,Weekend a Dublino,"Sono stata in questo hotel a fine gennaio, che dire, hotel ben curato, pulito. Personale disponibile e gentile. La camera è molto ampia offre un ampio armadio, una scrivania, un tavolino. Molti confort: phone, bollitore, frigo, ferro da stiro. Il bagno disponeva sia di vasca che di doccia, e offriva vari confort per il bagno, nota negativa non c'era una presa in bagno per il phone. Ci sono le fermate del bus molto vicine se non volete andare in centro a piedi. Noi abbiamo fatto la leap visitor, 20€ per 72ore compreso il bus dall'aeroporto, stra consigliata la card così risparmiate un po' di energie. 
Ci sono vari market vicino all'hotel.
Alla fine del nostro soggiorno il personale ci ha consegnato una bottiglietta d'acqua a testa, cosa molto carina e gentile.
Consigliato.",4,2018,07,16

211,"abbastanza comodo per arrivare in centro, gentili, stanze un attimo vecchie","Interessante hotel abbastanza vicino al centro e all'aeroporto. Io mi son sempre mosso a piedi perché traffico e taxi di Dublino sono un delirio.
La colazione è accettabile tendente al modesto, i croissant sono scarsi così come altre paste.
Il personale gentile e disponibile. La camera ragionevolmente spaziosa ma un po' vecchiotta, il bagno vecchiotto.",4,2018,04,30
211,Bello ed accogliente,"Hotel nuovo, moderno e ben arredato. Situato proprio a ridosso dello stadio Croke Park, dista circa 20 minuti a piedi dalla centralissima O'Connel street. Parcheggio sotterraneo disponibile per gli ospiti. Sala colazione molto ampia e cibo vario. ",4,2018,04,29
211,Sorpresa en la habitación,"Llegamos tarde y cansados, sólo queríamos descansar...lo primero que encontramos fue una botella de agua mineral vacía (había 2 cerradas correctamente), luego varias hojas dibujadas, una birome no del hotel, unos papeles de excursión, 1 blister vacío de medicamentos, un precinto de plástico...Al quejarnos en recepción la única pregunta fue: ""no son suyas las cosas?""",2,2018,04,26
211,Bell albergo peccato non centralissimo,"Appena tornata da dublino. L albergo è davvero bello , il personale molto cordiale e disponibile. Le camere belle pulite spaziose e anche riguardo al servizio in camera nulla da dire. L unica pecca che è si trova un po lontano dal centro ,circa 15 min, proprio difronte lo stadio e la zona non è gran che, un po periferica quindi è un po' pesante x ki se la vuole fare a piedi. Dall' aereoporto è facilmente raggiungibile basta prendere il pullman n 16 e scendere alla fermata drumcondra se nn sbaglio che si trova vicino  l'albergo.",4,2018,04,17
211,Hotel super consigliato,"Prenotato direttamente per il periodo di Pasqua, siamo stati a Dublino a trovare mia nipote che sta studiando li. L'hotel è a 15 minuti dal centro, la fermata dell'autobus vicinissima e non distante dall'aeroporto. Lo staff è gentilissimo e premuroso (essendo Pasqua hanno regalato delle uova di cioccolato a ragazzini e il giorno di Pasqua ci hanno fatto trovare un coniglio di cioccolato). La colazione è molto varia, forse l'unica pecca è che dovrebbero sviluppare l'offerta per la parte dolce. comunque c'è da dire che i toast e i pancake vengono preparati al momento. Il ristorante la sera per chi è stanco offre diversi piatti e a prezzi contenuti. Il cibo è buono. La pulizia della camera è stata soddisfacente e la quadrupla era enorme e silenziosa. I prezzi sono accettabili rispetto allo standard di Dublino che ho trovato carissima.",5,2018,04,12
211,Genial estancia,"Nos encantó este hotel moderno. El desayuno fue espectacular y aun mejor, la atención del personal, amablísimo en todo momento y con muchos detalles con nosotros. Ofrece parking gratis. La única pega, que está un poco retirado del centro si quieres ir andando y con niños pequeños - pero está muy bien comunicado en autobús.",5,2018,04,11
211,Ein schönes Hotel,"Wir haben das Frühstück vor Ort für 13 Euro gebucht statt 16 Euro vorab, wie wir es gelesen haben.Das Frühstück war sehr lecker. Man konnte sich ach frische Omelettes bestellen. Es lohnt sich mit dem Concierge zu sprechen. Er hat gute Geldwerte Tipps. So kann man auch die Hop on and off Tickets etwas günstiger erwerben als vorab im Internet.
Die Zimmer wie das ganze Hotel waren sehr sauber. Ca. 10 Minuten Fußweg in die City.

211,Wonderful,"Abbiamo soggiornato 5 notti, nel periodo di Pasqua; e abbiamo trovato un albergo pulito, silenzioso, camere spaziose e comode, bagno fotonico, personale disponibile e accogliente, il ristorante dell’hotel nn è da meno! Lo consiglio vivamente.",5,2018,04,03
211,Perfekter Ausgangspunkt für Städtetrip,"Das Hotel liegt direkt am Croke Park, dem größten Stadion Irlands. Das Stadtzentrum ist zu Fuß in 10 Minuten zu erreichen. Zu empfehlen ist das optionale Frühstück. Darauf achten, dass man Kaffeespezialitäten und Anderes wie zum Beispiel Pancakes kostenlos dazu bestellen kann. Kinder bis 12 sind frei. Die Zimmer sind sauber und großzügig für 4 Personen. Zwar keine Queen Betten sondern nur Doppel aber völlig ok. Der “Hop on hop off Bus” fährt morgens auch ins Zentrum. Ganz nett wenn man den ganzen Tag auf den Beinen ist. Außerdem ist das Ticket erschwinglich. Kinder unter 12 sind auch hier frei.",5,2018,03,30
211,Ottimo hotel,"Sono stata in questo hotel 3 notti con il mio fidanzato. La struttura si presenta molto moderna. Il personale è molto efficiente e disponibile.

Un bel 4 stelle: moderno, pulitissimo, accogliente,...
Personale molto disponibile, cordiale e giovane. 
È proprio di fronte allo stadio Croke Park e a 30 minuti a piedi dal centro della città. 
Colazione (dalle 6.30 alle 10.30) fresca fatta al momento con cucina e vista. Il caffè lo chiedi e te lo portano direttamente al tavolo quante volte vuoi.
Alla fine ci hanno chiamato direttamente loro il taxi e lo abbiamo aspettato nella hall dell'hotel stesso.
Ci siamo trovati benissimo e penso che se torneremo a Dublino sarà la Nostra prima scelta per il pernottamento.
5 stelle ampiamente meritato!",5,2018,03,19
211,UN HOTEL EXCEPCIONAL EN UNA CIUDAD CON NO MUCHA OFERTA,"El Hotel Croke Park es un hotel moderno y nuevo enfrente del estadio donde se juega este deporte difícilmente comprensible por los españoles (una mezcla de hockey hierba con rugby con lacrosse y con futbol).

Estuve por negocios y la atención fue exquisita. El bar por la noche está súper animado y las habitaciones, aunque no muy grandes, están fenomenal. 

Por ponerle alguna pega, la situación no es excesivamente céntrica, pero en una ciudad como Dublin, en la que se anda poco por el clima y la orografía propia de la ciudad y donde al centro se accede relativamente rápido, no representa un problema frente a la calidad del hotel.",5,2018,03,01
211,de lo mejor de Dublin,"Excelente Hotel, situado un poco en la periferia pero merece la pena para alojarse en Dublin.

211,100% recomendable,"El hotel fue una excelente opción. El personal es muy amable (como todos los irlandeses), se desviven por  hablar en español, dan recomendaciones, toallitas calientes a la llegada y agua a la salida.
El hotel está impecable, las habitaciones son espaciosas, con todo tipo de comodidades, reponen artículos de aseo de The White Company a diario, las camas son muy confortables, la temperatura perfecta y la limpieza excelente. Buena insonorización.
El desayuno continental vale 11 € y es muy buena opción porque en Dublín apenas hay cafeterías abiertas antes de las 9.
El parking es subterráneo y gratuito, conducir por la izquierda es fácil así que si alquilas un coche este hotel es la opción ideal.
Totalmente recomendable.",5,2017,12,14
211,Soluzione ottima per un week-end a Dublino.,"Abbiamo soggiornato al Croke Park ed abbiamo trovato la struttura accogliente, stanze pulite, ottimo il pub sia cibo che servizio.

211,Qualità e gentilezza,"Ho soggiornato in questo hotel per una breve vacanza di tre notti con la mia fidanzata, e devo dire che l'impressione sin dall'inizio è quella di stare nel posto giusto. Dista 15/20 minuti a piedi dal centro e 20/25 minuti da Temple Bar, ma ci sono comunque fermate dell'autobus a 5 minuti. Personale cordiale e gentilissimo, pronti a soddisfare ogni minima richiesta.

211,"Sehr netter Service, Rest mit Mängeln","Das Hotel befindet sich direkt neben dem durch den Bloody Sunday bekannt gewordenen Croke Park.

Es handelt sich um ein Standard-4-Sterne Hotet, das wie alle Standard-Hotels wenig im Gedächtnis bleiben wird.

Besonders positiv aufgefallen ist die ausnehmende Freundlichkeit durchgehend des gesamten Teams von der Rezeption bis zur Bar. Das trägt erheblich zum Wohlfühlen bei.

Außerordentlich negativ ist die Klimaanlage, die wir ausschalten mussten, da sie nicht nur gequietscht hat, sondern auch einen ziemlich starken Schimmelgeruch verströmt hat. Ich kann mir beim besten Willen nicht vorstellen, dass das gesund ist.

Das Zimmer war riesig und der Zimmerservice hervorragend, unser Zimmer war ausnehmend sauber. Abgesehen allerdings von der Minibar, die von innen ziemlich schmutzig war und auch nicht aufgefüllt wurde.

Beim Duschen stand das ganze Bad unter Wasser, aber das ist ein Problem, was in Hotels leider sehr häufig vorkommt. Zudem gab es Schimmelflecken und das Waschbecken war recht vermackt. Nachts konnte man im Bad den Silberfischchen zusehen.

Das Frühstück ist eher unterdurchschnittlich, die Auswahl sehr begrenzt. Dafür kostet es auch nur 13 Euro.",4,2017,11,17

211,Buena opción si no hay partido,"Nos hospedamos al principio de nuestro viaje por Irlandia y al final. En el mes de agosto de 2016. 

Las habitaciones están muy bien, son amplias, con camas muy cómodas. La habitación de los primeros días tenía un baño enorme con una bañera y una ducha a parte, la segunda su baño era más pequeño, solo tenía una ducha. 

Los hoteles, en general, en Islandia son modernos y nuevos, por tanto, es un hotel normal. 

En cuanto al servicio, los recepciones fueron muy amables pero en cuanto le preguntamos algo a un jefecillo que había por ahí, nos dió la sesación que nos trató maleducadamente. 

En la última noche, había un festival relacionado con el fútbol céltico (el estadio está en frente), y ese día era imposible descansar en el hotel, puesto que tanto la recepción como el patio interior que tiene había muchísima gente bebiendo y sobre todo muchos vasos sin dueño que se quedaban por las esquinas, mesas, suelo... Un poco desagradable si quieres descansar, y el ruido y la música no se fueron hasta bien entrada las 2 de la madrugada. Decir que los primeros días fueron muy tranquilos y silenciosos. 

En cuanto a la ubicación, está alejado del centro pero en un paseo de 20 minutos has llegado.",3,2017,09,14

Man wird definitiv günstiger unter kommen, aber das Preis-Leistungs-Verhältnis passt hier trotzdem. Es gibt hier rein gar nichts auszusetzen. Das Frühstück war ausgiebig und z.T. auch typisch irisch. Ein Highlight ist, wenn im benachbarten Croke Park Stadium ein Spiel ausgetragen wird.

También tiene un parking y entretenimiento musical nocturno en el bar (aislado), al menos cuñado estuvimos en agosto.

Überwachte, für Gäste gratis benutzbare Tiefgarage vorhanden. 

Theoretisch würde in etwa 700m Entfernung zum Hotel der Hop In/Hop Off Bus halten (wir warteten allerdings 45 min vergeblich). ÖV-Haltestellen in ca. 500-750m Entfernung (dann kann man aber fast zu Fuss in die Stadt...).

211,Genial ,"Si bien es cierto que no está céntrico, también es verdad que es un hotel muy bueno, con personal muy profesional y siempre dispuestos a ayudar.
Hasta O'Conell street hay como unos 15 minutos andando, pero es una zona tranquila y no hay que callejear mucho. Además, hay una parada de bus para el aeropuerto a 5 minutos. Aparte de esto, de mañana, los buses turísticos de la línea verde DODUBLIN vienen varias veces a recoger a gente. Allí mismo os venden los tickets si queréis.
Las habitaciones son muy espaciosas y con todas las comodidades que se esperan de un 4 estrellas. El baño también es grande y tiene una buena ducha. Debo decir que el colchón es muy blando y las almohadas también, cosa que a mí me resulta bastante incómoda.
El desayuno no estaba incluido en el precio de la habitación y lo cogimos aparte. El Full Irish sale a 12 €/persona y los menores de 12 años no pagan. Sin ser cosa de otro mundo, es muy completo y está muy rico.
Que su ubicación no te eche para atrás y si encaja en tu presupuesto, es una buena elección.",4,2017,04,16

Die Zimmer waren sauber und mit Badewanne UND Dusche ausgestattet.Die Boxspringbetten waren bequem und mit Dauenbettwäsche versehen.
Man sollte allerdings wissen,dass das Hotel ca. 15 Gehminuten vom Stadtzentrum entfernt ist.

211,"Perfecto, pero con una sola pega","El hotel está muy bien, con habitaciones espaciosas y un buen cuarto de baño. El desayuno es muy bueno, así como el personal que te atiende, que es muy competente. En la recepción hay una chica que es española y te ayuda en todo. La única pega que tiene es que está alejada del centro y no hay cerca una parada de autobús.",4,2016,12,14
211,El Hotel es excelente y moderno.,Las habitaciones son modernas y espaciosas. La gente es agradable. El único pero es que en la recepciòn no hablan español. El baño tenia bañera y ducha. Tiene tetera para tomarte un té. En resumen el hotel esta muy bien. ,4,2016,12,03
211,Excelente hotel,"Quedé maravillada con este hotel. Las habitaciones son hermosas, cómodas y grandes al igual que el baño. El desayuno es excelente y hay gran variedad para elegir.

211,JUNTO AL ESTADIO,"Encontramos una buenísima oferta en internet. La parada del autobús que viene del aeropuerto está a poca distancia, aunque pilla un poco lejos del centro de la ciudad y son cerca de 20 minutos a pie. Nuestro último día en este hotel coincidió con un partido de fútbol gaélico y la planta de recepción estaba llena de gente que había venido a ver el partido. Pese a todo, cuando vuelva a Dublín no descarto alojarme aquí otra vez.",4,2016,11,07
211,"Fantastisch. Lage, naja","Wir sind an der falschen Bushaltestelle ausgestiegen und mussten durch halb Dublin (nicht gerade gute Gegenden) laufen. Wenn man einmal weiß, wo man lang muss, ist die Lage aber ok. Das Hotel hat große, sehr saubere Zimmer. In der direkten Umgebung gibt es einige Restaurants. Das Coke Park Stadion sollte man sich auf alle Fälle anschauen.",5,2016,11,03
211,Sorprendente,"Parecería inicialmente un hotel frío y de paso, por eso de su buena localización desde el aeropuerto. ...pero sólo hasta llegar a recepción.
Desde el primer momento TODO el personal destaca por su amabilidad, lo que se agradece si vienes de viaje y cansado.

Y buena localización no busques más.",5,2016,10,27
211,Not bad.,"L'hotel non è male. Il servizio è efficiente e cortese. È pulito e la qualità della biancheria è buona
 Comodo il parcheggio, visti anche i prezzi di Dublino. La posizione non è delle migliori. La zona nord di Dublino è notoriamente la zona low level della città per cui se volete passeggiare per andare in centro attraverserete un quartiere popolare. Nessun problema comunque. Intorno non ci sono bar. ",4,2016,10,20
211,sauberes modern engerichtetes Hotel,"Auf unserer Irland Tour gebucht mit DER Tour verbrachten wir hier die letzten 2 Tage in Dubllin. Das Personal war sehr nett und zuvorkommend. Wir würden mit Erfischungstüchern begrüßt. Es war alles sehr sauber und ordentlich. Auch das irische Frühstück war sehr lecker und frisch. Am Abreisetag konnten wir das Auto in der Garage stehen lassen und noch ein wenig durch Dublin laufen, was zu Fuß kein Problem ist, da unser Flieger erst abends startete. Wunderbar. Wir haben uns rundum wohl gefühlt. Frühstück und Stellplatz waren im Preis enthalten, da wir aber pauschal bezahlt haben, kann ich über den Preis nichts sagen.",5,2016,09,17
211,Super Hotel,"Das Hotel ist modern und sauber. Es ist stilvoll eingerichtet, aber nicht durchdesignt. Soll heißen: modern aber so wie viele andere vergleichbare Hotels weltweit. 
Wir hatten im voraus gebucht und ein Familienzimmer mit zwei Doppelbetten für 2 Kinder und 2 Erwachsene bekommen. Das Frühstück war inklusive. Es hat gut geschmeckt und man konnte aus dem Buffet auswählen. Es gab die üblichen Sachen: Würstchen, Eier, Schinken, Bohnen, Käse, Marmelade, Früchte, Müsli... Man kann sich auch Pfannkuchen oder Omelette bestellen. 
Die Umgebung vom Hotel ist heruntergekommen, aber dass waren relativ viele Teile von Dublin.  Es ist ein kurzer Spaziergang von ca. 15-20 min. in die Stadt. Mit dem Bus ist man eher langsamer. ",4,2016,08,30

Fußweg in das Zentrum ca. 15-20 Minuten - i.e. kein Problem. Die Zimmer sind groß, modern eingerichtet; Personal ist jung und freundlich. Frühstück kostet extra, man kann die Kosten aber senken, wenn man schon am Vorabend bucht. Die übliche Küche am Abend - Burger, Sandwiches, aber auch gute Steaks, Fish & Chips,...

211,Zwei Tage Rugby Party ,"Wir hatten unbewusst gebucht, dass dieses Hotel neben dem Rugby Stadion liegt, doch obwohl die Anfahrt wegen einem Rugbyturnier am Wochenende etwas schwieriger war, eher ein Vorteil !
Am Samstag und Sonntag Party im Hotel bis 22 Uhr, danach Ruhe.
So könnte man ab 18 Uhr angenehm mitfeiern und die verschiedenen Fans beim Feiern beobachten.

Zum Hotel :
20 Minuten zu Fuß bis Temple Bar durch etwas komische Gegend oder besser für 11 € ab Hoteleingang mit dem Taxi.
Wer denkt er spart wenn er den Bus nimmt, weit gefehlt.Drei Personen kosten auch 8,50 € und man ist 10 Minuten länger unterwegs.
Hotel ist ok, Frühstück müsste bei dem Preis inklusive sein,
Continental Breakfast 9,- € pro Person.
Zimmer sauber aber hellhörig.
Die ein oder andre Ecke im Hotel gehört bereits renoviert, Bsp. die Bank im Frühstücksraum, manch Sitzbank einer S Bahn in Deutschland ist weniger abgenutzt und sauberer.",4,2016,08,01

211,Un weekend a Dublino,"Hotel ben organizzato nonostante sia una grossa struttura, ottimi il servizio e le pulizie in camera, ambienti spaziosi e silenziosi. Tipica irish breakfast abbondante e molto varia: il bis non è anormale. Prenotando con buon anticipo direttamente dal sito dell'albergo si ricevono le camere superior con ottimo rapporto qualità/prezzo è colazione inclusa. Pur essendo leggermente decentrato, prendendo dimestichezza con i vicini e frequenti mezzi pubblici il centro è facilmente raggiungibile. ",4,2016,05,22
211,Personale molto gentile,"Ottimo albergo tra l'aeroporto e downtown,ma circa 2,5 km dal centro, ci si può arrivare abbastanza comodamente anche a piedi con una passeggiate di 20 min.

211,Hotel Fabuloso,"Hotel muy bien situado, muy cómodo, habitaciones enormes. Personal muy amable.
Ideal para familias con niños pequeños. 
Mi duda es, en lo días de partido, al estar tan cerca del estadio, el hotel tiene que vibrar entero con todo el estadio en ebullición.",5,2016,05,03
211,De primera,Cuenta con una muy buena ubicación y con un amplio parking. La atención y el trato es muy buena. Las habitaciones son muy acogedoras y amplias. La comida está muy bien. El servicio es muy bueno. La calidad-precio está bien. Repetiré.,5,2016,04,27
211,Alles TipTop jedoch ca 20Fussminuten vom Zentrum,"Modern, sauber, hell und geräumig! Das Hotel lässt sich empfehlen, einziger Wehrmutstropfen es liegt etwas ausserhalb. Der Hop in Hop off Bus hält jedoch 3-4mal am Tag am Hotel, am besten Sie erkundigen sich an der Reception.",5,2016,04,27
211,War nett.,Nettes Hotel direkt gegenüber vom Croke Park Stadion. Die Zimmer sind eher klassisch ausgestattet. Das Frühstück ist ok. Die Bar liefert gute Drinks und verschiedene Biere. Kein deutschsprachiges TV verfügbar. WLAN funktioniert dafür ganz gut.,4,2016,04,23
211,schönes Hotel - das Spezielle fehlt,"Wir haben wunderbar geschlafen, nachdem wir dekorativ servierte fish and chips und ein paar Bier in der Bar genossen haben. Das Hotel ist modern und stilvoll. Der Service freundlich und zuvorkommend. Das Zimmer ist großzügig, das Bas sauber und mit allem Notwendigen ausgestattet. Uns fehlte das Besondere, individuelle. Es gibt viele Hotels, die ähnlich modern und stimmig eingerichtet sind.",4,2016,04,14
211,Top Hotel mit netter Executive Lounge,"Das Hotel hat auf vollster Linie überzeugt. Die Lage ist vielleicht noch das größte Manko, da in der näheren Umgebung nicht wirklich viel los ist und man doch etwas Zeit benötigt um zu Fuß in die Innenstadt zu gelangen.

Das Personal war super freundlich und hilfsbereit. Schon vor Reisebeginn wurde ich angerufen um die große Reservierung nochmals zu bestätigen und um Extrawünsche wie zB Bettenwahl zu besprechen. 

Die Zimmer selbst waren sehr schön und das Badezimmer besitzt eine Dusche sowie eine separate Badewanne. Der Wasserdruck im Waschbecken war leider etwas schwach, aber war nicht wirklich von Bedeutung.

Da wir die Deluxe-Zimmer gebucht hatten, wo der Zugang zur Executive Lounge inkludiert war, hatten wir jeden Morgen ein kontinentales Frühstück inkludiert sowie den ganzen Tag kostenlosen Orangensaft, Apfelsaft, Wasser, Tee, Kaffee, Kekse und Obst. Auch am Zimmer gab es Mineralwasser kostenlos.Zusätzlich gab es pro Tag noch einen Voucher für ein kostenloses Getränk an der Hotelbar.

Also ich kann das Hotel nur wärmstens empfehlen. All unsere Wünsche wurden seitens des Personals erfüllt und unsere Erwartungen wurden eigentlich noch übertroffen!",5,2016,03,23
211,Perfetto!,"Ho soggiornato al the Croke Park dal 23/01 al 25/01 con il mio fidanzato.

Das Personal war über aus zuvorkommend!
Hatten ein Zimmer mit King size Bett, Frühstück inklusive. Zugang zu Erfrischungsgetränken 24/7.

Dieses Hotel können wir nur empfehlen!",5,2016,02,12

211,¡Genial hotel y trato excepcional!,"Excelente hotel. Amplio, limpio, cómodo, todo muy nuevo. El WiFi funciona con mucha potencia y a la primera, gratis por supuesto, sin publicidad ni registros. La habitación doble es enorme, tiene zona de moqueta que da algo de calidez (parece muy limpia también). Instrucciones para el AC. La ducha fácil, cómoda. 
Pero lo mejor de todo es la atención. Son irlandeses amables y tienen mucha flexibilidad con el horario para la cena (mi avión se retrasó y llegué para cenar a las 21:00). El desayuno abundante y de buffet.
Lo recomiendo!",5,2016,01,28

211,Capodanno a Dublino ,"Abbiamo soggiornato in questo hotel la notte di capodanno e ci siamo trovati molto bene!
Hotel dispone di un parcheggio molto spazioso dove ti è permesso di parcheggiare gratuitamente!
Le receptionist sono molto disponibili e sono a disposizione per qualsiasi chiarimento!

211,Ottimo!,"A quindici minuti (coi mezzi) dal centro di Dublino, è un hotel ottimo ed estremamente comodo. Ben servito ai mezzi pubblici, dà la possibilità anche di usufruire di navetta per tour turistici con pullman in città.

Colazione molto varia.",4,2016,01,04
211,Schönes Haus mit Abtrichen für öffentlichen Verkehr und Frühstück,"Also gut, sehr gut etwas hoch, jedoch befriedigend zu tief. Der tolle Preis wird damit erkauft, dass man doch etwas ausserhalb ist und die Anbindung mit dem öffentlichen Verkehr nicht optimal. Wir hatten eine 72 Std. visitor leap card für 19.50 EUR. Die nächste Bushaltestelle liegt etwa 8min vom Hotel entfernt. Dorthin bzw. von dort geht es aber in rund 20-30min zum Flughafen und in rund 10min in die Innenstadt. Taxi kostet nach Temple Bar etwa 12.-- EUR, was nicht teuer ist, sich aber hochrechnet, wenn man nur das Taxi braucht. Zu Fuss braucht man 20-30min. Das Frühstücksbuffet hat uns nicht umgehauen - ist zuwar reichhaltig, jedoch nicht immer alles vorhanden, so war als wir angekommen sind kaum Käse da und keine Wurst - wurde erst auf nachfrage nachgefüllt. Da habe ich schon deutlich besser gefrühstückt auch in Hotels (waren auch nur einen von 3 Morgen da). Ansonsten ist das Hotel sehr sauber, schnelles WLAN, schönes Bad und aufmerksames Personal.",4,2016,01,03
211,Ideales Hotel mit top Service,"Wir haben im Croke Park 5 Nächte verbracht, um Dublin und Umgebung zu erkunden. Das Hotel liegt nicht direkt im Zentrum, aber in Gehdistanz - oder mal mit Taxi (günstig!). Ideal war für uns das gratis Parking.
Das Zimmer auf dem Executive Floor hat sich sehr gelohnt aufgrund des Gratisfrühstück und der kostenlosen Softdrinks, die immer zur Verfügung standen. Schade war nur, dass die Terrasse stets geschlossen war.
Die Betten sind wunderbar, wir haben selten so ein bequemes Hotelbett gehabt.
Das Personal ist wahnsinnig aufmerksam und freundlich - ausser an der Hotelbar, wo wir zweimal waren und zweimal war der Service mässig (45 Minuten lang kam niemand in Sichtweite = bestellen an der Bar). Housekeeping, Reception und Concierge waren aber alle sehr hilfsbereit und freundlich. Bei Abreise haben wir etwas im Zimmer vergessen, was uns aber sehr schnell und umkompliziert nachgeschickt wurde.",5,2015,12,14
211,Genial en todo pero la ubicación le resta la máxima puntuación,"El hotel ha estado muy bien, limpio, fantástico desayuno (quizás se podrían mejorar los zumos) y todo en general. Destacó a Marta en recepción, muchas gracias. Y, sobre todo, a Jessica en los desayunos: que chica más agradable y simpática y atenta... De todo. ¡Qué le suban el sueldo ya!
La única pega del hotel es su ubicación alejada del centro y con no muy buenas comunicaciones",4,2015,12,10
211,Hervorragendes Hotel für Urlaub oder Business Trip,"Ein modernes, dem Croke Park Stadion gegenüberliegendes Hotel, welches nur 15 Gehminuten vom Stadtzentrum entfernt liegt. Vom/zum Flughafen via Taxi in ca. 20 Min. (€ 21,-/Fahrt) oder mit der Dublin Bus-Linie ""41"" in ca. 30 Min. Etwa 5 Gehminuten entfernt befindet sich die Bus- und S-Bahn-Station ""Drumcondra"". Mit der S-Bahn ""Luar"" oder den Dublin Bus-Linien ""1"" und ""16"" fährt man ins/vom Stadtzentrum.
Die Einrichtung des Hotels ist gediegen elegant, das Superior-Zimmer (1 Doppel- und 1 Einzelbett, Flat-Screen, Hifi-Anlage, Tee- u. Kaffeekocher mit kostenlosem Kaffee, Tee und heißer Schokolade, Klimaanlage, Haartrockner in einer Schublade -nicht im Badezimmer- fix verankert) war stets sauber. Das Badezimmer enthielt WC, Dusche, Badewanne, kostenlose Körperpflegeprodukte (Duschgel, Shampoo, Körperlotion). Die Waschtischplatte wies leichte Abnützungserscheinungen auf, es war aber ebenfalls alles stets sauber. Man erhielt eine Key-Card, welche sowohl fürs Zimmer als auch den Aufzug und das Stiegenhaus verwendet wurde. Kostenloses, sehr schnelles WLAN im ganzen Hotel verfügbar. Außerordentlich freundliches und hilfsbereites Personal. Das continentale Frühstück bestand aus Rührei, Spiegelei, weichen Eiern, Rösti-Ecken, Pilzen, gebackenen Bohnen, white u. black pudding, Wurst u. Schinken (gewöhnungsbedürftig), Käse, Obst, Joghurt, Müsli, Honig, Brötchen, Tee, Kaffee und div. Säften.

Mit dem Taxi vom Flughafen in ca. 15-20 Minuten für etwa 20 Euro zu erreichen.
Die Innenstadt ist zu Fuß überraschend gut zu erreichen, ca. 15-20 Minuten braucht man z.B. zum Spire.

Sehr netter und kompetenter Empfang beim Check-In.
Zimmer ok, Betten gut, Bad leider mit einigen Abnutzungserscheinungen.
Sauberkeit ok.
Minibarpreise moderat (Softdrinks 3,50).

Schnelles Gratis WiFi.

Leichtes Chaos beim Handling der Taxi-Bestellungen, wahrsch. wegen dem Web Summit.

Tip: Buchung mit Paket in Executive Lounge, d.h. für irische Verhältnisse gutes Frühstück inklusive, ganztägig Softdrinks, Tee/Kaffee, Snacks ebenfalls.

Si trova a Croke Park di fronte al noto stadio a circa 2km dal pieno centro (Temple Bar) e poco più di un km da O'Connel Street.
Prezzi: Noi onestamente abbiamo speso una bella cifra. Hotel 4 stelle e sicuramente meritatissime ma è chiaro che non lo si può categorizzare come economico.
Camere: Perfette, pulitissime. L'unico piccolissimo disagio che il letto venduto come matrimoniale sembrava un 1 piazza e mezza. Ma bagni, stanza e servizi impeccabili.
Colazione: Bel buffet, molto ricco. Ideale per gli amanti del salato (dolce molto poco presente). Tutto di ottima qualità!
Personale: Cordiale e disponibilissimo.
Palestra: Vera chicca per gli appassionati. Finora nei miei viaggi la palestra più completa mai trovata in un albergo.",5,2015,10,27

211,Ein Kleinod neben dem drittgrößten Fußballstdion Europas,"Wir verbrachten eine Nacht in diesem wirklich tollen Hotel. Die Betten sind sehr bequem, die Zimmer Ausstattung lässt keine Wünsche offen. Sogar die Möglichkeit sich ein Heißgetränk zuzubereiten ist geboten. Und das noch dazu ohne Extrakosten. Das Fullbreakfast ist typisch irisch; white and black pudding, sausages, ham and eggs, etc. Besonders und so vorher noch nie dargereicht ist hier der Honig. Es steht am Frühstücksbuffet eine große Honigwabe, die in toto verzehrt werden kann. Nur die Wachsschicht wurde entfernt und der Honig schmeckt außergewöhnlich gut. Natürlich gibt es auch Obst, Käse, andere kalte Komponenten, Cereals in verschiedenen Formen. Man kann auch extra zubereiteten Porridge beim Personal bestellen. Ein sehr reichhaltiges, typische irisches Frühstück mit dem man fast den ganzen Tag ohne etwas zu essen durchhalten kann.
Wir kommen gerne mal wieder.",5,2015,09,27
211,Interesante solo si tienes vehiculo,"El hotel en general esta bien,quizás la 4 estrella le venga un poco grande.Las instalaciones son correctas,limpias y el personal muy muy eficiente...
Lo recomiendo a personas que dispongan de vehículo,ya que queda un poco alejado (mas o menos 25 minutos a pie del centro).No hay un transporte publico cerca del hotel.
Nosotros nos alojamos en una junior suite en la cuarta planta,y la reserva decia claramente (Habitacion para pareja con niño de 15 años,por lo tanto vama king size/matrimonio y cama extra..¡¡Pues bien ,al llegar tuve que reclamar 2 veces la cama extra y al final lo conseguí al volver al hotel ya tarde...!!! La cama supletoria casi no cabia en la habitacion y el baño no estaba preparado con toallas para tres..
El baño aunque tiene bañera y ducha separadas, no es tan practico como pudiera parecer,ya que la ducha no dispone de ""alcachofa"" para poder ducharse a la vez que en la ducha y solo hay una pila donde asearse,lavarse los dientes etc..en un 4 estrellas se agradeceria 2 lavamanos no solo 1...
El hotel es tranquilo,limpio y bien atendido,el desayuno completo y correcto...
Buena calidad de Wi.fi gratuito",3,2015,09,02
211,Alles perfekt,"Das Zimmer war super groß, alle Mitarbeiter waren sehr bemüht, die ""Side Bar"" nutzten wir jeden Abend zum Ausklang, kleiner Tipp: gleich nach der Brücke neben dem Hotel gibt es einen kleinen Italiener (echte Italiener), das sog. Wallace's Asti- geht dorthin zu Abend essen, es ist einfach genial! Wir waren von 6 Abenden 5mal dort, konnten also einiges ausprobieren, und wir sind sehr verwöhnt von unserer steirischen Küche! Zurück zum Hotel: Parkplätze gibt es gratis in der Tiefgarage, denn ohne Leihwagen ist Irland nur halb so schön. Das Frühstück ist genial, es ist für jeden etwas dabei. Es gibt einen Shuttle zum Hop on hop Off Bus in der Innenstadt. Das besonders schöne dabei: Man steigt vor der ersten offiziellen Haltestelle ein, hat also einen Riesenvorteil in der Platzwahl! Das Badezimmer ist auch sehr schön mit einer Badewanne und einer großen Dusche. Es gab nichts aber auch gar nichts zu bemängeln, obwohl gerade das Semi Finale der Gälischen Football Liga im Stadion gegenüber statt fand und im Hotel die Post abging. Um 22:00 war nur noch in der Side Bar was los aber auf dem Zimmer bekam man davon nichts mit. WLAN war überall gut verfügbar. Trotz Innenstadtnähe konnten wir bei offenem Fenster gut schlafen.",5,2015,09,01
211,Bien situado y cómodo,"Con un emplazamiento muy adecuado y parking gratuito este Hotel dispone de un buen bar y es moderno y funcional. Ademas te ofrecen agua mineral de cortesía al llegar y al salir. El desayuno es muy aceptable. Solo una crítica: el tamaño de la cama doble fue demasiado estrecho.

211,Bonito y cómodo,"Es un buen hotel. Si tienes suerte y hay partido de hurling en el estadio es perfecto, pues está enfrente del estadio de deportes gaélicos. Nosotros pudimos ver un gran partido. El desayuno y las habitaciones muy correctas. Andando hasta el centro de la ciudad quince minutos. Taxi 10 euros.",4,2015,08,27
211,Ottimo hotel,"Un hotel che vale tutte le stelle che ha. Camere silenziose e ben pulite, ottimo il ristorante sotto ed è fornito di buona Wi-Fi gratis e di una palestra a piano terra. Rimane un po' fuori dalla città di fronte lo stadio gaelico di Dublino ma lo consiglio sicuramente se non si deve visitare subito il centro. Vicino ha delle case in stile georgiano molto carine",5,2015,08,25
211,Trattamento eccellente... anche dopo il soggiorno.,"Veramente poco da aggiungere... Camera quadrupla spaziosa, comoda e pulita (viaggiamo con due bimbi di 8 e 10 anni). Personale gentilissimo e sempre pronto a dare suggerimenti con il sorriso sulle labbra (cosa che ci ha lasciato piacevolmente colpiti). Colazione super sia come qualità che come quantità. Ristorante molto buono (lo abbiamo recensito a parte). Non distante dal centro di Dublino, ma comunque collegato benissimo. Insomma, siamo stati veramente bene. Infine, mi hanno aiutato, sempre con grandissima cortesia, ad affrontare un problema con la società della mia carta di credito (nel frattempo ci eravamo spostati a Killarney). Che dire di più? Beh, che grazie a questo albergo abbiamo scoperto il football gaelico... ed ora il mio piccolo vuole diventare un giocatore!!!",5,2015,08,23

211,Superiore alla media,"Bella struttura, finiture recenti, localizzato tra lo stadio e la ferrovia, che peró non porta disturbo visto il basso numero di treni in transito.
Possibilitá di raggiungere il centro in 20 minuti a piedi, fermata del pulmann a meno di 10 minuti, in taxi con meno di 10 euro.
Le stanze sono spesso per tre persone, con comodi letti. Un matrimoniale ed un singolo, senza problemi di spazio. Sicuramente un buon punto di appoggio in cittá.",4,2015,08,03
211,Ottima struttura.,"Il Croke Park Hotel di Dublino si trova a circa una ventina di minuti a piedi dal centro.Forse tornare la sera tardi,da soli,può creare qualche piccola preoccupazione dal momento che la zona circostante non è tra le più amene di Dublino (ma non è neanche il Bronx,intendiamoci).L'hotel è veramente ottimo,offre una prima colazione estremamente abbondante con prevalenza di salato ma con buona offerta anche di dolce.La camera e il bagno che ho avuto erano alquanto spaziosi e non ho trovato niente che non andasse.Il wifi è gratuito e potete anche contare su di un bollitore in stanza che vi dà l'opportunità di farvi un tè o un caffè magari con un poco di latte e due biscotti parecchio burrosi.Di fronte all'hotel si trova il Croke Park Stadium dedicato ai soli sport gaelici e teatro di un tragico Bloody Sunday il 21 novembre 1920.Quando uscirete per raggiungere il centro andate a destra e poi sempre dritto passando per Russell Street,Fitzgibbon Street,Mountjoy Square,Gardiner Place,Denmark Street Great e Gardiner Row.Quindi incrocerete Frederik Street che poi cambia nome e diventa O'Connell Street.Andate a sinistra e,camminando camminando,supererete il ponte sul fiume Liffey e a quel punto sarete in prossimità del Trinity College,della pedonale Grafton Street e del quartiere Temple Bar.E' dunque il momento di degustare una buona Guiness e di girare più che potete!!!",5,2015,07,29
211,Gutes Hotel nahe der Innenstadt,"Das Hotel liegt nur etwa 20 Gehminuten von der Innenstadt entfernt. Die Ausstattung des Zimmers ist komfortabel, das Personal ist freundlich und entgegenkommend und der hoteleigene Parkplatz perfekt geeignet für ein Mietauto.

211,Ottimo hotel!,"Abbiamo soggiornato in questo Hotel per tre notti, le stanze sono molto grandi e pulite, anche il bagno è pulitissimo.
Inclusa nella prenotazione c'era anche la colazione, non abbondantissima, ma assolutamente sufficiente, senza calcolare la possibilità di prendere bottigliette di acqua o succhi in qualsiasi momento anche da portare fuori per la giornata.
Il personale è molto disponibile e preparato e c'è anche il wi-fii gratuito in tutto l'albergo. Non è molto distante dalla fermata dell'Aircoach da e per l'aeroporto.
L'unica pecca è che non è vicinissimo al centro che si può raggiungere con una passeggiata di circa 25 minuti o con il taxi.",4,2015,06,19
211,Ruhig gelegen und gut zu erreichen,Das Hotel ist mit dem Auto sehr gut zu erreichen und auch die Lage zum Flughafen ist sehr gut da man nicht durch ganz Dublin muss. Zu Fuß ist man in ca. 20 Minuten im Zentrum. Der Service und die Zimmer sind sehr gut. Auch das Essen in der Bar ist gut. Das Hotel liegt ziemlich ruhig das einzige ist eine Bahnlinie auf der ab und zu ein Zug den man bei geschlossenem Fenster so gut wie nicht hört.Ich kann dieses Hotel nur weiterempfehlen.,5,2015,06,13

El único inconveniente es q esta a 30 minutos caminado del centro y para una semana q estuvimos se termina haciendo pesado ir y venir hasta el campo de fútbol ",4,2015,05,27
211,Muy buena relación calidad-precio,"Fuimos con amigos para las fiestas de St. Patricks y el hotel nos dejó encantados por su gran relación calidad precio. Los principales aspectos a destacar son:

1.Habitaciones: Muy nuevas, espaciosas y limpias, con televisión con cable y reproductor de música para conectar al iPhone. Además, había calentador para agua si se quería hacer una infusión. Había ducha y bañera.

2.Trato del personal: En todo momento recibimos toda la ayuda necesaría para ubicarnos en la ciudad, encontrar restaurantes, eventos, viajes a otras ciudades, ...

3.Ubicación: Es su principal punto débil si no se quiere andar demasiado. Se encuentra a unos 15 minutos del centro a paso ligero. Las vistas de las habitaciones dan a la fachada del campo de fútbol y son un tanto curiosas. Se encuentra bién conectado con el aeropuerto a solo 5 minutos de la parada de autobús.",4,2015,05,18
211,Nettes Hotel - etwas außerhalb,"Wir waren im April zum 5. Mal in Dublin. Diesmal haben wir uns für The Croke Park Hotel entschieden. Das Hotel gehört schon zu den Besseren in Dublin. Es ist modern, sauber und gut ausgestattet, die mir sonst bekannten Hotels hatten dafür mehr Charme. Auch um sich Dublin und Umgebung anzusehen, würde ich eine andere Lage empfehlen, z.B. ist Ballsbridge deutlich hübscher, grüner und mit der DART Bahn perfekt an die Innenstadt angeschlossen. Gerade wenn es regnet oder man eh den ganzen Tag viel gelaufen ist, macht der 20-minütige Spaziergang nicht besonders viel Spaß. Die direkte Umgebung ist eher farblos, der neben dem Haus entlang fließende Kanal wird erst im weiteren Verlauf ansehnlicher, die Bahnschienen, welche eher selten befahren wurden, sind eh nie hübsch und das Stadion ist ein großer, grauer Kasten. Ich empfinde die Gegend aber nicht als unsicher oder dreckig und hatte auch keine Probleme. 
Check-In / Check out verliefen schnell und problemlos. Das Personal insgesamt war sehr freundlich, kompetent und aufmerksam.
Die Zimmer haben uns sehr gut gefallen: schön groß und sauber; sehr komfortable, große Betten; sehr sauberes und modernes Badezimmer mit großzügiger, bodentiefer Dusche und extra Badewanne, und stets neu aufgefüllten Badeutensilien, allerdings kein Kosmetikspiegel. Der Kleiderschrank war eher für Businesskleidung ausgelegt, wenig Ablagefläche und zum Teil offen. Bügeleisen und Hosenpresse waren vorhanden. Gut war das Behältnis für das Crushed-Eis, welches man im Flur bekommen konnte – einziges Manko dabei: unsere benutzten Gläser wurden am nächsten Tag nicht weggeräumt und stapelten sich dann im Zimmer.
Die Lobby empfand ich persönlich als zu laut insbesondere durch die Musik Beschallung, aber die Sitzbereich waren gemütlicher als die Sideline Bar. Hier wären wir dann auch beim größten Kritikpunkt. Die Bar war sehr ungemütlich, ein großer Teil der Möbel schon arg verschlissen, der ganze Raum schlecht Schall isoliert. Der Nachbarraum, der bei großem Andrang geöffnet wurde, erinnerte eher an eine Kantine. Dafür war das Essen sehr lecker und der Innenhof nett gestaltet.
Wir hatten ebenfalls das Glück/Pech während eines Events im Croke Park Stadion im Hotel anwesend zu sein (es war das Finale der Gaelic Football League). In der Bar konnte man sein eigenes Wort nicht mehr verstehen, Essen wurde gar nicht serviert, Tische, Boden und Tresen sahen aus wie  S… – hier mussten wir zum Essen auf das Sideline Bistro ausweichen, welches ebenso wie die Bar ungemütlich und den Charme einer Kantine hatte. Aber es war auch lustig und absolut friedlich. Die anschließende Feier ging wohl bis spät in die Nacht. Wir haben davon nicht viel mitbekommen, unsere Begleitung, die ihr Zimmer gegenüber des Fahrstuhls hatte, umso mehr…
Insgesamt hat uns das Hotel aber gut gefallen. Beim nächsten Mal werden wir aber wieder Ballsbridge vorziehen.",4,2015,05,06
211,"Buon albergo, ottimo ristorante","Partiamo dai limiti. Sicuramente la posizione relativamente defilata dal centro. Vedendo la mappa sembra una semplice passeggiata per arrivare in centro, in effetti si tratta di almeno 30 minuti a piedi per strade non particolarmente interessanti. Comunque a Dublino i taxi non sono un problema anche per i prezzi contenuti. Il secondo limite è il costo che mi è sembrato di fascia superiore a quella dell'albergo. Veniamo ai dati positivi, stanze e bagni ampi, comodi e ben arredati. Ambienti ben isolati acusticamente e buon segnale wifi. Personale cortese e disponibile, colazione molto abbondante anche se non particolarmente varia. Una chicca che vi consiglio vivamente è la cena; normalmente evito di mangiare in albergo ma una sera eravamo particolarmente stanchi e siamo rimasti a cena. Una vera sorpresa, sicuramente il pasto migliore che ho fatto in terra gaelica e soprattutto con note di raffinatezza che denotano la presenza di uno chef capace e creativo. Tutto sommato è più da 5 ""palle"" che da 4. Consigliato.",5,2015,04,21
211,BELLISSIMO E PULITISSIMO,"Abbiamo soggiornato durante il week-end pasquale mio figlio ed io, l'hotel è fuori dal centro di Dublino ma ben servito da taxi e da autobus, personale cordiale, accoglienza ottima, la pulizia è assolutamente da 10 e lode! 
Se tornerò in questa meravigliosa città, l'hotel sarà sicuramente il medesimo!",5,2015,04,07
211,Sehr schönes Businesshotel etwas außerhalb der Innenstadt gegenüber des Croke Park Stadium,"Nach einem Aufenthalt 2008 ergab sich nun wieder die Möglichkeit, im Croke Park Hotel zu übernachten. Der Empfang war wieder sehr freundlich, und auch meiner Bitte nach einem Zimmer mit Stadionblick konnte wieder entsprochen werden. Für jemanden, der nicht so sehr in dieses Stadion vernarrt ist wie ich, ist die Umgebung und damit der Ausblick eher unspektakulär.
Das Zimmer entspricht dem üblichen Businesshotelstandard mit einem sehr hübschen Bad mit großer Dusche und großflächigen beigen Fliesen. 
Das Frühstück war sehr reichhaltig und wurde im ansprechenden Barbereich serviert.
Die in anderen Kritiken gefundene Angabe, dass es sich um eine schlechte Gegend handeln würde, kann ich so nicht bestätigen. Mehrfach bin ich mit dem Bus bis Drumcondra gefahren und dann die kurze Strecke durchs Wohngebiet bis zum Hotel gelaufen, und das völlig ohne Probleme. Und ich bin als Landpflanze recht empfindlich, was ""unsichere"" Gegenden angeht.
Der Preis von unter 100 € ist für Dublin wirklich sehr günstig, in der Stadtmitte wird es sehr schwierig überhaupt akzeptable Hotels für diesen Preis zu finden. Wer sich also mit der minimal weiteren Anfahrt anfreunden kann (Drumcondra liegt an der Buslinie zum Flughafen, für Autos gibt es hoteleigene Parkplätze, evtl. kostenpflichtig), ist mit diesem Hotel meiner Meinung nach sehr gut bedient.",5,2015,04,06
211,HOTEL PERFECTO,"Alojamiento a destacar por todo en general. Es cierto que no es muy céntrico, pero hay que tener en cuenta que Dublín no es muy grande, que es muy llana y resulta fácil de caminar. Este hotel se encuentra ubicado a unos 15 minutos andando de la zona turística. Respecto a los comentarios que ví en esta página de que en este trayecto te podías encontrar a personas peligrosas, nada más lejos de la realidad. El camino se hace muy agradable puesto que recorres unas calles con edificios típicos de la zona así como un parque espectacular. Hablando ya del hotel, el inmueble de por sí es moderno, se encuentra enfrente del estadio de rugby y las habitaciones son enormes. La nuestra tenía una cama de 1,35 y otra más de 90, ambas comodísimas. No tiene importancia que tenga ruedas, comentario que leí también en esta página, no se mueven nada de nada, implicando que es de una mayor comodidad para las personas que realizan la limpieza de las habitaciones. Todo un detalle para los trabajadores/as. Asimismo tenía un ventanal grande con vistas a un patio exterior que aportaba tranquilidad y ausencia de ruídos, a la vez que luminosidad. El baño espacioso con una ducha y una bañera.  El desayuno exquisito. Había frutas de todo tipo y por supuesto el típico desayuno irlandés, con salchichas, huevos fritos, revueltos, duros, bacon, morcilla, panes de todo tipo al igual que dulces, mermeladas, una jarra de café al gusto, tostadas recién hechas con pan blanco o integral, etc, etc... Y la atención del personal maravillosa. Repetiría otra vez y mil veces más.",5,2015,04,06
211,Muy detallistas,A llegar te dan una toallita húmeda y al marcharte una botella de agua. En la habitación tienen secador y articulos para poder hacerte te/cafe/chocolate caliente y una galleta. El hotel es perfecto. Está a 20 minutos andando del centro. Con buen tiempo es un paseo agradable.,4,2015,04,05
211,Ottimo Hotel,Anche se è fuori Dublino l'Hotel è molto bello e accogliente. I costi sono molto abbordabili rispetti a quelli del centro ma bisogna mettere che ci vuole sempre il taxi (20 euro andata e 20 euro il ritorno ),5,2015,03,30
211,Carino e confortevole,Un hotel molto carino si trova davanti allo stadio di rugby di dublino. Zona tranquilla a 10 minuti d autobus dal centro di dublino e circa 20 minuti a piedi. Personale cordiale. Ci siamo trovati bene. ,4,2015,03,21
211,"Cómodo y agradable, pero...","El hotel tiene cosas muy positivas. Es cómodo y las habitaciones espaciosas. El desayuno cumple, aunque los precios son bastante altos para el mismo. Las camas tienen ruedas sin frenos lamentablemente y la administración no fue capaz de hacerse cargo, bajo la excusa de ""todos los hoteles tienen camas con ruedas (y sin frenos)"". Fuera de eso, la comida y el servicio a la habitación fueron muy buenos, si bien el servicio de cable y entretenimiento deja algo que desear.",3,2015,02,25
211,Ottimo e tranquillo,"Hotel molto curato e in zona tranquilla. In 15 minuti si arriva in centro a piedi. Colazioni Irish full a 12€ se pagate il giorno di arrivo con di tutto di più. Personale gentile e disponibile, qualche problema risolvibile di comprensione della lingua.",5,2015,02,19
211,Es war schon mal besser,"Nachdem ich bereits Ende 2013 dort übernachtet hatte in einem sehr schönen Zimmer, habe ich mir erneut dieses Hotel ausgesucht.
Beim Check-In hatte ich sehr inkompetentes Personal. Ich hatte über booking.com gebucht mit Frühstück. Allerdings heißt das nicht, dass das Hotel diese Information bekommt, denn die haben nichts von zusätzlichem Frühstück in den Daten gehabt. Anstatt danach nochmal gefragt zu werden bekam ich die Zimmerkarte. Ich hatte vorher ausdrücklich darum gebeten ein ruhiges Zimmer in den oberen Etagen zu bekommen. Ich bekam ein Zimmer im ersten Stock. Warum fragt das Hotel bitte danach, wenn es Wünsche sowieso ignoriert?
Am nächsten Tag gab es dann die Überraschung. Für unser Zimmer gab es kein gebuchtes Frühstück. Die folgenden Tage waren wir täglich an der Rezeption um neues Frühstück zu buchen, weil die Herren und Damen an der Rezeption immer nur für einen Tag abbuchen wollten, das Problem für den nächsten Tag könnte sich dann ja eventuell lösen.
Das Zimmer war ok. Es war alles sauber, die Aussicht wie bereits bekannt nicht schön, da in weniger schöner Gegend. Eine Lampe hat nicht funktioniert.
Leider waren 2 Spieltage im Croke Park Stadium zu unserer Zeit. Ich weiß nicht warum ein 4 Sterne Hotel das machen muss, aber es war alles voll mit Fans die ihre Plastikbecher mit Alkohol in der Lobby hatten. Man kam zeitweise kaum in das Hotel rein weil der Eingang von Rauchern belegt war. 

Die Gegend des Hotels ist nicht die beste. Es ist ruhig, wenn keine Spiele sind und man braucht 10-15 Minuten ins Zentrum zu Fuß. Die Busse brauchen länger.
Nachts sollte man alleine und vorallem als Frau nicht in der Gegend unterwegs sein.

Das Frühstück ist im Vergleich zu anderen Hotels gut. Es gibt wenig Aufschnitt für die ziemlich kleinen Brötchen. Das irisch/englische Frühstück ist sehr gut! Mit deutschem Standard ist es aber nicht ansatzweise zu vergleichen.

Die Preise im Restaurant sind vollkommen in Ordnung. Lebensmittel Preise in Irland sind recht hoch und in anderen Restaurants zahlt man ähnliche Preise.
Ich empfehle allerdings eher in Pubs oder andere Restaurants in der Stadt zu gehen. Da gibt es einige sehr schön!",3,2015,02,19

211,Tolles Hotel,"Es war ein sehr sauberes Hotel. Die Zimmer waren schön gestaltet und der Service super freundlich. Das Frühstück war wirklich sehr übersichtlich, nicht mit einem deutschen Standard-Frühstück zu vergleichen. Für einen Tag hatten wir uns das irische Frühstück dazu gebucht. Dies kann ich nicht empfehlen, da es sich wirklich nicht für den Mehrpreis lohnt. Ansonsten kann ich dieses Hotel nur weiterempfehlen. Die Lage ist nicht gerade zentral, aber man gelangt zu Fuß relativ schnell in die Innenstadt.",4,2015,02,04
211,Super Hotel,"Waren für 2 Tage dort um den Geburtstag eines Kollegen zu feiern,
das Preis / Leistungsverhältnis ist auch sehr gut und denn Service denn wir erfahren haben war äusserst zuvorkommend. Da wir jedoch nie dort gegessen haben kann ich nicht sagen wie das Essen war.

Todos los comentarios son positiivos.",5,2015,01,06
211,¡Fantástico!,"¡No pudimos tener mejor alojamiento para tan precioso viaje a Irlanda! Empecemos por partes:
- La localización: algo alejada del centro (unos 15 minutos andando) pero si os compráis una tarjeta del bus turístico os recogen del hotel, eso sí, para la vuelta al hotel el bus corta muy pronto así que cada día nos ha tocado subir andando. La zona es segura, deberías tomar las típicas precauciones al volver de noche, como en cualquier sitio, ya que hay un parque y no está muy alumbrado, pero bordeadlo en lugar de cruzarlo por la mitad y ya está. 
- El hotel (diseño, habitaciones): Es una gozada, muy lujoso, cada detalle es único, cada rincón es increíble... sencillamente magnífco. Al llegar, nos ofrecieron dos toallitas calientes y húmedas, con un olor buenísimo, que se agradece para aliviarlas del frío. Hay una biblioteca, zona de bar, y en la 4ª planta hay un executive lounge, una sala genial para descansar, tomar un té y unas pastas... (creo que esta opción la tendréis dependiendo de la habitación)
Las habitaciones están muy bien cuidadas, limpias y con todo lo necesario. La cama es comodísima y el descanso está garantizado.
- El personal: muy amable, atento y dispuesto a dar opciones si ocurre cualquier imprevisto. La primera noche nos comunicaron que había un problema con nuestra habitación y no podían darnos la que teníamos reservada solo por esa noche. En recompensa nos regalaron el desayuno para cada día. Y por eso... puedo opinar sobre el desayuno!!
- El desayuno: No es de los más completos que he visto pero está muy bien, tienen tres tipos de dulces, tres tipos de pan, cereales varios, mermeladas, fruta, zumos... Te sirven el café en la mesa y te preguntan si quieres tostadas (las que sirven son de molde)

En definitiva... todos los detalles de este hotel, Irlanda y todo lo que visitamos hizo que nuestra estancia fuera inolvidable. ¿Que si recomendaría este hotel? Absolutamente :)",5,2014,12,21
211,Bello e ottimo servizio,"Siamo stati benissimo è un hotel bellissimo e con un servizio ottimo. 
Colazione abbondante, location molto suggestiva e curata.

Noi abbiamo usufruito del servizio notte e colazione ma vi posso garantire che il pranzo non vi serve. 
È vicino al centro solo 15 minuti a piedi, quindi con possibilità di andare dove si vuole, comunque Dublino offre anche un servizio ottimo per spostarsi con i loro mezzi di trasporto",5,2014,12,20
211,Schöne Zimmer,"Wir waren vom 05.-08.12.14 für einen Städtetrip dort. Die Zimmer waren schön und sauber. Das Personal war ok. Wir mussten oft lange warten bis wir bedient wurden.

Personale molto disponibile per ogni nostra esigenza, gentile nonostante che non conoscevamo la lingua ma con un buon vocabolario tutto è possibile. Colazione abbondante, internazionale, senza mancanza di nessuna cosa eventualmente a una richiesta il personale è sempre di una gentilezza estrema nel venire incontro alle esigenze.

Camere belle, spazio (l'unica cosa letto un po' piccolo), bagno nuovo con doccia e vasca, inoltre il tutto è Insonorizzato e non si sente davvero volare una mosca.. Staff gentile anche se parlano solo inglese quindi ci si deve un po' arrangiare per capire chi non parla bene l'inglese. Parcheggio gratuito nell'hotel. Consigliatissimo!!!! ",5,2014,12,02
211,OTTIMO ALBERGO,"Ottimo albergo, in tutto! Difficile fare delle critiche. 
Situato a 10 km dall'aeroporto e a quindici minuti a piedi dalla via centrale di Dublino.
Abbiamo prenotato con offerta Expedia ed il rapporto qualità prezzo era nettamente superiore; per poce e dico poche centinaia di euro, abbiamo soggiornato in 3 per 4 notti da sogno.
Ottima l'accoglienza di personale veramente giovane ma con professionalità e cortesia che raramente si trova..
Camera di giuste dimensioni, non eccessiva ma dotata di ogni confort e rifatta due volte al giorno.
Noi abbiamo soggiornato al piano exclusive con biancheria da letto di ottima qualità, accappatoi  ciabatte e bianceria da bagno morbidissimi.
Televisore schermo piatto, wifi gratuito in tutta la struttura e addirittura i carica telefono predisposti.
Per gli ospiti del nostro piano era prevista una exclusive lounge dove poter riposare ascoltando musica classica, far colazione o uno spuntino durante il giorno, sorseggiando bevande calde o fredde , acqua a volontà, biscottini e snack.
Spazi comuni ben tenuti e ottima puizia in tutto l'hotel camere comprese.
Comodo il parcheggio sotterraneo che è gratuito per gli ospiti dell'hotel, ottimo il ristorante, non propiamente economico ma di qualità elevata.
Noi viaggiavamo con la ns bambina di 4 anni ed effettivamente unico neo è la distanza dal centro vero di Dublino che si raggiunge in circa 15 minuti a piedi...
Fattibilissimi la mattina..
La sera, la bimba un poco stanca, li devi ripercorrere con 18 kg sulle spalle!!!
Nessun problema propio davanti all' hotel si ferma la navetta del tour op on op off, che ti porta in centro..
Ottima scelta per visitare la città con calma,sali e scendi quando vuoi ed intanto ti raccontano in italiano che cosa trovi alla fermata successiva; tutto al costo di 19 euro, bimbi gratis e vale 2 giorni.
E per il ritorno se non vuoi prendere l'autobus di linea, il taxi per 7 euro ti porta fino all'hotel.
Dublino è affascinante, vista con il cielo terso che noi, con la ns sfacciata fortuna, abbiamo potuto ammirare, ancora di più. Da non perdere la Guinnes Storehouse.
Anche i dintorni della città sono molto belli e caratteristici, con la comodità della macchina ancora più a portata di mano..
In città non portate la macchina ma girate con i mezzi...
i parcheggi sono pochi, a pagamento e costano circa 6/7 euro all' ora.
Noi abbiamo fatto una gita fino alle Cliffs of Mhoer: scogliere mozzafiato di una bellezza disarmante come tutto il paesaggio che le circonda, tutto sà di Irlanda vera, classica...
Però vale la pena di vistarle con calma come tutto il Connemara, da Dublino è una sfacchinata di 3 ore e non le godi appieno..
In conclusione hotel CONSIGLIATISSIMO, che vale i quindici minuti a piedi dal centro.
LI VALE TUTTI!!!",5,2014,12,01
211,Albergo super,Albergo stupendo servizio impeccabile non e proprio centrale ma in 15 minuti veri a piedi si e in centro la colazione e la cena conviene farla in albergo qualita ottima e prezzi uguali a fuori vicino c'è un ristorante italiano molto buono per quel che riguarda  dublino citta veramente cara e brutta ti fanno pagare qualsiasi cosa 18 euro per il museo della guinness veramente soldi buttati gli irlandesi sono molto simpatici e pronti ad aiutarvi ma parlano velocissimo e non si capisce nulla se non si e padroni della lingua,5,2014,11,29
211,Spitze - gerne wieder,"In diesem Hotel sind wir leider nur 1 Nacht gewesen, haben aber den Aufenthalt mehr als genossen. Das Personal war überaus freundlich und hilfsbereit. Am Abreisetag haben wir sogar noch eine Flasche Wasser kostenlos erhalten. Die Zimmer sind schön und geräumig. Das Hotel liegt etwas außerhalb, was aber keineswegs störend war.",5,2014,11,27
211,Ottima scelta,"Hotel senza difetti, se si esclude il fatto di non essere in centro. Detto questo, dall'arrivo alla partenza sarà difficile trovare un motivo per non essere più che soddisfatti della scelta, grazie anche ad un rapporto qualità-prezzo pressoché introvabile a Dublino.",5,2014,11,17
211,recomendable opción en Dublin.,"Una opción estupenda para alojarse en Dublin, el hotel fantastico y el precio muy recomendable.

211,SOGGIORNO PERFETTO,"Siamo stati qui 3 notti ad Ottobre. L'hotel è molto bello, standard elevato per essere in Irlanda; le pulizie rigorose e precise; la colazione continentale divina, spaziava dal dolce al salato. Il personale molto cordiale. La ragazza che la mattina accoglie alla colazione è gentilissima e molto disponibile. Consiglio",5,2014,10,06
211,Ottimo,"Buona posizione dell hotel rispetto al centro, circa 15 minuti da temple bar.. La colazione é molto fornita e il personale é disponibile e simpatico. Ottimo anche per persone celiache!

211,"Molto buono, posizione non ideale","Siamo stati a Dublino a fine giugno con amici. Questo albergo, scelto dal tour  operator, è posizionato proprio di fronte al Croke Park Stadium (che merita una visita), è moderno, ben attrezzato, dotato di personale gentile e disponibile (non aspettatevi, però, che parlino italiano). Camere spaziose, dotate di ampi letti, bagno ben arredato anche se, come al solito, privo di bidet. Unica pecca, se così vogliamo chiamarla, la distanza dal centro: a piedi servono una ventina di minuti, in taxi la metà.",4,2014,07,05
211,Ottima struttura per visitare Dublino,Ho prenotato questo hotel attraverso un offerta su venere e sono rimasta molto soddisfatta! Pulizia ottima con cambio lenzuola e asciugamani giornaliera. Cortesia e disponibilità del personale(che ci hanno offerto delle bottiglie d'acqua sia al momento del check-in che al check-out)! Camera ampia e spaziosa con un letto matrimoniale e un letto singolo ( noi avevamo prenotato una standard room). L'hotel dista circa 10-15 minuti a piedi dal centro! Consiglio il croke park a chi vuol visitare questa cittá stupenda!,5,2014,07,03
211,Gutes Hotel in guter Lage,"Das Hotel liegt ca. 15 Minuten entfernt vom Zentrum allerdings in einer etwas schlechteren Gegend. Das  Zimmer war sehr geräumig. Das Pesonal ausgesprochen freundlich und der Service super. Das Frühstück war OK. Leider wirkt das Inventar etwas abgerockt. 
Wir würden wieder buchen. 
",4,2014,07,02
211,Muy buen hotel,"El hotel esta genial, la habitación amplia, el lavabo con ducha y bañera; el servicio y la atención excelente. 
La única pega es que está un poco alejado del centro y dependes del bus o de taxi para llegar. 
Caminando al inicio de de la calle O'Connell andando se tarda entre 15-20 minutos, y al Temple 25-30 min. 
Por la noche no es recomendable caminar por esa zona, nosotros regresábamos en taxi des del centro, nos costaba unos 10€.   ",5,2014,06,25
211,Nulla da eccepire se non fosse....,"Albergo vicino al Croke Park Stadium e ottima posizione per andare in centro (20 minuti a piedi) e per uscire dalla città. Struttura pulita, buona la colazione ed ottima la cucina del ristorante. con mio marito avevamo prenotato una camera in offerta che si trovava al piano dei VIP(lo abbiamo saputo dopo!!!). Fino alle 19 c'è il cameriere al piano che passa spesso ora per gli accappatoi, ora per i cioccolatini...Noi abbiamo avuto la sua visita per ben 3 volte ogni mezz'ora. E' riuscito ad entrare anche quando gli abbiamo detto di attendere. Dice che non aveva sentito. Mah...Il direttore si è scusato e ci ha offerto da bere.",4,2014,06,25
211,ottima scelta,"Dopo aver letto numerose recensioni positive ho cercato delle tariffe interessanti trovandole su travelocity. La quadrupla per due adulti e due bambini è risultata comoda, molto pulita, spaziosa quanto basta per tre notti a Dublino per business+weekend. I plus: bagno ampio con doccia e vasca, wifi e parcheggio coperto inclusi. Abbiamo anche cenato una sera che non volevamo ritornare in centro ed è stata una piacevole scoperta con piatti curati sia nella forma che nella sostanza ad un prezzo di due piatti a testa di circa 27 euro. Professionale il servizio.
A piedi si raggiunge o'connelly street in 15 minuti. Soddisfatti!",5,2014,06,14
211,Bueno pero alejado,"Si no te importa caminar o tener que tomarte un bus para ir al hotel ésta es una excelente opción. El hotel no tiene puntos negativos. Muy buenas habitaciones y buena internet. Pero Dublin tiene un clima complicado así que no es mala idea quedarse en un hotel más céntrico. Nosotros sin ninguna duda lo hubiésemos aprovechado para descansar un rato del frío, la lluvia y el viento! Por otro lado, los más céntricos tenían valores mucho más altos o tenían críticas algunas no muy favorables. No me arrepiento pero sólo estuve dos noches. De haberme quedado más, creo que me hubiese pegado la distancia.",4,2014,06,09
211,"Ausgezeichneter Service, sehr modern, gemütlich","Nur ca. 15 min Fußweg vom Zentrum entferntes, ruhig gelegenes, sehr sauberes Hotel.  Sehr modernes und luxuriöses Ambiente ohne übertrieben zu wirken. Das Personal ist sehr freundlich und hilfsbereit. Jederzeit wieder. Die beste Seafood Chowder von Dublin :-)

211,ottima qualità prezzo,"sono stato in questo hotel per capodanno e devo dire che ne sono rimasto piacevolmente colpito. non è vicinissimo al centro anche se ce la siamo fatta sempre a piedi (15/20 minuti) mentre in taxi bastano 5. L'hotel è molto bello e comodo, proprio di fronte al Croke stadium dove vi consiglio di fare il giro panoramico. non abbiamo mai mangiato in hotel quindi non mi posso esprimere sulla cucina. Ve lo consiglio però vivamente qualità molto alta ad un ottimo prezzo.",4,2014,05,26
211,Ottimo hotel,"Io ed i miei amici siamo stati a Dublino ad inizio aprile. Devo dire che l'albergo ci ha molto soddisfatto in tutte le sue componenti. camere molto grandi, arredate in maniera funzionale, letti di   una piazza e mezza comodissimi, bagno di dimensioni molto notevoli. Leggendo alcuni commenti avevamo alcuni dubbi sulla posizione, ma pur non essendo centralissimo, si raggiunge O'Connell street, via centrale che poi porta nella zona dell'Università e al Tample Bar in appena 15 minuti a piedi. Colazione superba soprattutto per noi che non amiamo ""pranzare"". Quindi consigliato alla grande!!",5,2014,05,02
211,Un ottimo Hotel a Dublino,"Ho soggiornato per 3 notti in questo hotel a fine aprile 2014, facendo parte di un gruppo di circa 30 persone.
NOTE POSITIVE:
RECEPTION: tutti gentilissimi e disponibili (sebbene nessuno parli italiano), con una nota di merito per Stephen: professionale, gentilissimo....magari se ne trovasse uno per Hotel come lui.....
SPAZI COMUNI: ampi, ben arredati e soprattutto pulitissimi con personale efficiente e cortese. Presente anche una palestra e postazione internet con annessa stampante (a disposizione dei clienti) anche se in Hotel è attivo un potentissimo Wi-Fi gratuito. Fornitissimo il bar...
COLAZIONE: belle ed ampie le sale adibite alla colazione (non compresa nel prezzo: € 9,95 la colazione continentale, € 14,95 la colazione completa irlandese). Fornitissimo il buffet, con opzioni calde continuamente rifornite
CAMERE: forse la note migliore dell'Hotel: grandi, pulite, fornite di tutto: TV (che fa anche da computer), radio, frigo-bar, bollitore per the e caffe (con ampia scelta di bustine per la preparazione), asse da stiro e ferro, riscaldamento autonomo, Wi-Fi in camera (gratuito) ed un ampio bagno (senza bidet...però) con vasca e doccia. Il phon, che a prima vista sembra mancare, è nei cassetti dell'armadio.
NOTE NEGATIVE:
1) la posizione: l'Hotel è un po' periferico, ma con 15 minuti di passeggiata (non corsa campestre) si arriva in centro. Si trova proprio di fronte al Croke Park Stadium, un tempio (83.000 posti) degli sport gaelici, per cui nel fine settimana l'hotel è preso d'assalto da centinaia (o forse migliaia) di avventori e conseguente confusione
2)la moquette nelle camere, peraltro pulitissima per l'efficiente servizio di riordino e pulizia delle camere
IN CONCLUSIONE: le note positive superano di gran lunga quelle negative.
CONSIGLIATISSIMO
Comunque un",5,2014,04,29
211,Muy alejado y OJO con el desayuno!!!,"Hemos estado alojados en este hotel durante 2 noches. La reserva la realice por su página web.

Reserve una habitación Deluxe con desayuno, pues resulto que estas habitaciones tienen un espacio privado donde hay un poco de leche, zumo, fruta y zumo (fantastico pensamos) pero tenia trampa, el desayuno tambien era en esta sala, nos quedamos asombrados!!!! Al dia siguiente cuando bajamos a desayunar nos cortan la entrada y nos dicen que nuestro desayuno es arriba y que si queremos desayunar abajo hemos de pagar 10 € cada uno. 
A todo esto decir que en recepción nos informarón mal y nos dieron las dos opciones cuando hicimos el check-in.

Pagamos 110 € por una habitacion doble y nos dieron un desayuno de hostal, pan del dia anterior, un par de lonchas de salami y el segundo dia no habia nada dulce, cuando se lo reclame al ""camarero"" me digo que iba poniendo y que lo haria en 30 minutos!!!!

Otra desventaja es la ubicación, esta a 35 minutos de Temple Bar y a 20 minutos del inicio de la calle O'conell, el problema es que desde el hotel hasta la calle O'conell es una zona malisima, la primera noche que volviamos al hotel a las 22:30 nos encontramos 3 personas, en todo el camino y los 3 estan pidiendo dinero!!!!

Sobre lo demas muy bien, la habitación amplia y limpia pero con esas desventas.

Lo más importante es si con mi esperiencia recomendaria este hotel y rotundamente NO lo recomendaria, por 110 € hay muchisimas más opciones en el centro!!!!",1,2014,04,27
211,Ottimo albergo,"Consigliato a tutti. Un quarto d'ora a piedi dal centro di Dublino e un quarto d'ora di taxi dall'aeroporto.
Pulito, ordinato con camere ampie e dotate di ogni confort.
Il personale cortese e disponibile con una sola piccola pecca: interagiscono solo ed esclusivamente in inglese.",5,2014,04,26
211,Ottimo hotel,"Siamo stati le scorse cinque notti in questo hotel. Le camere sono molto pulite, molto attrezzate ed il bagno è sempre in ordine. C'è anche una piccola palestra con attrezzi ginnici. C'è bisogno di 10 minuti per arrivare, a piedi, al centro di O'Connell street ma la struttura val bene una passeggiata. 
Vorrei ringraziare il portiere che stamattina 22 aprile, alle ore 04.00 a.m., ci ha chiamato il taxi: davvero gentile.
L'unica nota dolente: alla reception, le ragazze non sempre riuscivano a capire chi, come me, non parla l'inglese e credo che, in un hotel così grande, sia necessario almeno conoscere qualche lingua in più oltre l'inglese. 
Per me e la mia famiglia comunque è stata davvero un'ottima scelta. Ci tornerei volentieri e lo consiglierei vivamente agli amici.",5,2014,04,22
211,Muy buen hotel,"Es un gran hotel,  las habitaciones amplia , limpias y comodas, el personal muy atento y amable.
El restaurant y el bar con una calidad buena, el precio razonble.
la única pega es la ubicación, si vas con coche este sería sin duda el destino elegido, a pie queda un poco alejado del centro y la zona no tiene servicios.",4,2014,04,21
211,gutes Hotel in Dublin,"Das Hotel liegt etwas ausserhalb des Zentrums welches allerdings gut und rasch erreichbar ist, ist gut ausgestattet, die Zimmer sind groß, leider sind die Wände sehr dünn so dass man alles hört.

Preise ok",3,2014,04,20
211,Muy buen hotel. Un cuatro estrellas de verdad.,"El hotel está muy bien, muy limpio, es bonito y acogedor. Tuvimos la suerte de encontrarnos en recepción con Sandra, sevillana, que no atendió muy bien, nos explicó todo sobre cómo movernos. Es cierto que se encuentra un poco distante del centro ciudad, pero el paseo es de tan sólo 15 minutos. Además al ir un grupo de 6 el día que nos desplazamos más lejos tomamos un taxi (que nos pidieron en el hotel) de ida y otro de vuelta y nos salió sobre 20 € cada vez. Una de las noches cenamos en el hotel, la comida estaba muy rica, al igual que el desayuno, variado, aunque tipo de buffet irlandes, con unos dulces muy buenos. En definitiva, lo recomendamos porque es un hotel cuatro estrellas como los habitualmente que encuentras en España.",4,2014,03,04
211,"Nicht im Zentrum, dafür Luxus und ruhige Lage","Glücksgriff. Wir waren an einem Wochenende ohne gälische Heimspiele. Das Hotel liegt direkt gegenüber dem Croke Park in dem die einheimischen Mannschaften die gälischen Sportarten ausüben.
Tolles Hotel. Große Zimmer, toll ausgestattet mit wirklich tollem Bad. 
Frühstücksbuffet sensationell!! Riesige Auswahl, auch an full Irish breakfast!",5,2014,01,20
211,Empezar el Año en Dublin,"Este año lo empezamos con una escapada a Dublin y ha sido una magnifica experiencia en la que ha influido de forma muy positiva este hotel. A un paseito del centro neuralgico de la ciudad, el hotel es fantastico, muy tranquilo, habitaciones muy amplias y limpias, bien equipadas, parking gratuito y un excelente desayuno muy bien servido. Cien por cien recomendable para quien visite esta ciudad.",5,2014,01,12
211,Noch 4 Punkte,"Das Hotel ist recht modern und neu. Es liegt etwas außerhalb des Stadtzentrums, allerdings ist man mit dem Bus in 20 Min. in der Stadt.

Der Service im Hotel ist oft bemüht, aber auch unprofessionell. Beispielsweise war der Concierge zwar sehr nett, allerdings konnte er uns nicht helfen. Nachdem er uns verschiedene Belfast-Touren angepriesen hatte, musste er feststellen, dass die in den nächsten Tage überhaupt nicht stattfinden. Über Busverbindungen nach Beflast wusste er nichts. Auch beim Frühstück gab es einige Probleme. Wir mussten teilweise auf einen Tisch warten, Kaffee und Tee kamen lange nicht usw.

Ok, aber zuviel Geld sollte man für das Hotel auch nicht ausgeben.",4,2014,01,11
211,Hotel extraordinario,"Inmejorable relación calidad precio. 
El tamaño de las habitaciones y de los armarios más propio de un cinco estrellas. 
Gran cuarto de baño, con ducha y bañera independientes. 
Las zonas comunes del hotel te permiten estar a gusto si no quieres salir, buen restaurante, cafeteria y bibilioteca. 
El personal hace todo lo posible por que estés contento, para los que no manejan el inglés hay una chica en recepción de sevilla, que te ayuda en lo que necesites. También en los desayunos hay una chica que habla español. Gracias a las dos. 
El desayuno es bueno y variado.",5,2014,01,04
211,Spitze !,Wir haben über Silvester 4 Tage im Croke Park Hotel verbracht und waren sehr begeistert. Das Hotel gehört sicher zu einem der Besten in Dublin. Frühstück & Zimmer waren absolut TOP ! In Deutschland würden sich manche Hotels dafür mir 3-4 Sternen rühmen. In ca. 15 Minuten ist man in der Innenstadt. Jederzeit wieder,4,2014,01,02
211,Empfehlenswertes Hotel für kurzen Städtetrip,"Das Croke Park Hotel ist ein durchaus empfehlenswertes Hotel für einen kurzen Citytrip. Es liegt direkt neben dem Croke Park Stadium, das Stadtzentrum erreicht man in ca. 15 Gehminuten. Die Zimmer sind sauber und relativ komfortabel.",3,2014,01,01
211,Für den Preis exzellent,"Wir haben pro Nacht unter €100 gezahlt, dafür können wir das Hotel nur exzellent bewerten. Ein gut ausgestattetes, gut gepflegtes 4 Sterne Haus mit hervorragendem Service.

Aufgrund eines Fehlers unseres Brokers Olotel standen wir vor einem geschlossenen Hotel als wir in Dublin ankamen und wurden erstmal eine Nacht in einem anderen Hotel zwischengelagert, bevor das Croke Park am nächsten Tag wieder nach dem Christmas Break öffnete. Im Croke Park hat man uns dann umgehend alle entstandenen Kosten erstattet und als wir beim Abendessen waren, kam der Hotelmanager und hat spontan die nicht billige Flasche Wein von der Rechnung genommen als Entschuldigung. Wohlgemerkt, das war der Fehler des Brokers, das Hotel hat aber im Kundeninteresse alles auf seine Kappe genommen.

Service immer gut, ob beim Frühstück (sehr günstig!), Concierge, an der Rezeption, der Bar oder beim Abendessen. 

Parkplatz ist kostenlos dabei. Und die Lage gut. 15 Minuten in die Stadt zu Fuß, €10 mit dem Taxi nach Temple Bar.

Auch das Restaurant ist sehr gut, leckeres Essen und gute Weine.

Wir würden wieder hingehen.",5,2014,01,01
211,OTTIMO HOTEL un po' lontano dal centro,"Ottimo Hotel al di sopra delle aspettative. Non proprio in centro. Personale cordiale, camera spaziosa, pulitissima e ben attrezzata (ferro da stiro, stirapantaloni, TV, bollitore per tisane ecc., internet via cavo e wireless). Bagno, con vasca e doccia, sempre pulitissimo. Da raccomandare.",5,2013,12,31
211,"Excelente en trato, comodidad, limpieza y servicios","Estuvimos en el puente de diciembre. Los trabajadores son muy amables. La habitación muy amplia, con unas camas muy cómodas, los baños disponen tanto de ducha como de bañera en el mismo, muy confortable en general. El desayuno muy rico, amplio y variado, siempre teniendo en cuenta las preferencias del país (bacon, salchichas ...) pero disponías también de fruta, embutido y bollería. 
A diez minutos andando del centro. Próximo a una parada del autobús para el aeropuerto. Exquisita limpieza
Si vuelvo a Dublin, repetiremos. ",5,2013,12,18
211,Excepcional hotel en Dublín,"Hotel muy cercano al centro de Dublín, ubicado en una buena zona. Servicios excelentes, exquisito trato a precios razonables. El desayuno que ofrecen es de auténtico espectáculo, en calidad, variedad y preparación. Las habitaciones son muy amplias y cómodas, con unos baños también amplios. Quizás lo único criticable (y va en gustos) es la dureza del colchón (debería ser un poco más duro). Pero eso es por buscar algún detalle criticable. Excepcional hotal a buen precio.",5,2013,12,09
211,Empfehlenswert für Städtetrip,"Wir waren 4 Nachte im Croke Park Hotel und können es weiterempfehlen.
Nachdem wir zunächst ein Zimmer mit Badezimmer für Behinderte hatten, welches statt Dusche und Badewanne lediglich Dusche mit Duschvorhang hatte, haben wir auf unsere Bitte hin sehr schnell ein neues Zimmer bekommen. Große Zimmer mit großen Betten, Zimmer und Bad sind sauber, leider kein deutsches TV-Programm. Wir hatten ein Zimmer zur Straße, also zum Stadion hin. Dies war leider etwas zu laut, auch wenn im Stadion keine Veranstaltungen sind. Wenn man empfindlich ist sollte man also Ohrenstöpsel mitnehmen.

Frühstück auch in Ordnung, eher englisch / irisch (Würstchen, Speck, Toast) aber auch Obst, Müsli... Leider ist es im Frühstücksraum etwas hektisch und damit zweitweise ungemütlich. Kommt aber auch darauf an, wie viel los ist (hatten einen Morgen, an dem alles überfüllt war mit Hurling-Fans, die im Hotel aufgrund eines Finalspiels übernachtet haben). 

Fitnessraum ausreichend für ein kurzes Workout,  neue Geräte und große Glasfront mit Blick aufs Stadion.

In die Stadt kann man in etwa 15 Minuten zu Fuß gehen. Bus fährt in ca. 5 Minuten Fußweg auf direktem Weg zur Innenstadt (OConnelStreet) für 1,65€ pro Person. 

In der Nähe des Hotels (Drumcondra Road, dort wo auch die Bushaltestelle ist), gibt es ein paar Restaurants (Asia, Pizzeria), außerdem Apotheken, ein Supermarkt, eine Art 7/11 mit ATM und ein Pub.
Sehr empfehlenswert ist ""Independent Pizza"". Außergewöhnliche Pizza-Beläge, sehr lecker, nettes Personal, wir waren gleich zwei Mal dort :-) (Achtung! Am Wochenende muss man abends reservieren!)",3,2013,10,10
211,Hotel genial,"El hotel estaba genial, justo enfrente del estadio, estaba a un paseíto del centro, pero gracias a esto era super tranquilo. Las camas muy cómodas y todo muy limpio, pero lo mejor era el desayuno incluído, espectacular, tenías un buffet en el que elegir irish breakfast además de tostadas, cereales, fruta, fiambre, bollos y todo lo que quisieras, y además todo buenísimo.
Se puede ir andando al centro y para volver un taxi, que desde Temple Bar costaba unos 13-14 euros y al aeropuerto unos 20 y poco, que entre varios sale muy bien.",4,2013,10,08
211,Una maravilla de trato recibido y hotel 5 estrellas,"Venimos encantados por el trato recibido en el Hotel. Los empleados se dejaban la piel por atenderte y que estuvieras como en casa. El hotel es un hotel nuevo, las habitaciones grandes y espaciosas, con detalles en la habitación, pero lo mejor es el personal que siempre está con una sonrisa para atenderte y dar lo mejor de ellos. El hotel se encuentra a 15 minutos andando del centro, en una zona tranquila, donde no escucharás ruidos y podrás descansar bien. Los desayunos a parte de la comida tradicional irlandesa, tienen bollería, fruta y todo lo necesario para que desayunes bien, todo muy bueno. El zumo de naranja con pulpa también muy bueno. Hemos estado en hoteles de cinco estrellas y aquí tratan mejor a los huespedes. Repetiremos sin duda. Gracias a todos los miembros del personal del hotel de parte de nuestra familia!",5,2013,10,07
211,Schönes Stadthotel,"Für eine Städtereise ist dieses Haus sehr zu empfehlen, alles sauber und ordentlich. der einzige Wermutstropfen war die Bar in der man die Kellner zur Bedienung fast überreden musste. Allerdings erwarten diese für Ihre Leistung auch kein Trinkgeld, sei in Irland nicht üblich.",3,2013,09,24
211,VERAMENTE OTTIMO,"Ho soggiornato per tre notti in questo fantastio hotel dove l'unica nota ""negativa"" era la posizione non propriamente centralissima ma con 10 minuti a piedi si era in pieno centro. Per il resto tutto veramente ottimo. Stanze molto grandi con ogni confort, letto king, televisione, impianto stereo, ferro da stiro, frigo, occorrente per preparare tisane- te, bagno enorme con vasca e doccia. Ottima la pulizia con cambio biancheria giornaliero. La colazione compresa nel mio pacchetto era veramente abbondante con grandissima scelta di dolce e salato. Il personale gentilissimo e disponibile anche a capire chi, come me di inglese non parla una parola. Ottima esperienza e un consiglio, non lasciarsi influenzare dalla posizione, vale veramente la pena di fare quei 10 minuti di strada.",4,2013,09,10
211,Hervorragendes Hotel in Dublin,"Das Croke Park Hotel ist ein relativ modernes Hotel direkt gegenüber des Croke Park Stadiums unweit des Dubliner Zentrums, welches man in ca. 15 Minuten zu Fuß erreicht. Hervorragend ist auch die Nähe zum Flughafen, den man mit dem Auto in ca. 20 Minuten erreicht. Außerdem verfügt das Hotel über eine kostenfreie Tiefgarage. 
Die Zimmer des Hotels sind ausreichend groß und modern ausgestattet. Wlan ist kostenlos verfügbar. Das Früstücksbuffett bietet alles, was man von einem guten irischen Frühstück erwartet. Das Hotel ist für einen Dublin-Aufenthalt mit dem Auto sehr zu empfehlen. ",5,2013,09,08

211,"Bell albergo, moderno e accogliente: peccato per la zona!","Albergo confortevole, con parcheggio compreso, piccola palestra e spazi comuni belli, soprattutto la zona pub con maxi schermo.
Camere carine, funzionali e pulite.
Personale gentile ma non al top alla reception: camera preparata per due mentre eravamo in tre e quando segnalato invece di aggiungere gli asciugamani mancanti hanno aggiunto il quarto letto, che per altro non ci stava, e che abbiamo dovuto far togliere al rientro il camera. Oppure indicazioni non corrette per la città.
Ma il vero punto dolente è la zona. Se non hai interesse a stare di fronte allo stadio ti trovi in una zona veramente bruttina, dove per trovare un pub in cui si potesse camera e non solo bere ti devi fare 15 minuti a piedi.
Anche le fermate dei mezzi per il centro sono scomode, tenendo conto che Dublino è una piccola città con una atmosfera molto frizzante devo dire che non si riuscita a cogliere in quella zona periferica.
Se di giorno vai in giro alla sera ti passa la voglia di rifarsi la sfacchinata per tornare in centro.
Così non ci abbiamo mai cenato . . . in centro.
Devo dire che in albergo si mangia bene senza spendere tanto.
Per il costo del hotel non po che dire, io ho speso poco prenotando con booking.com dall ltalia, ma visto che i prezzi cambiano continuamente con divari notevoli.
Se torno a Dublino voglio stare in centro per godermela.",4,2013,08,30
211,bien pero lejos,"El hotel en sí está bien, limpio y con habitaciones espaciosas. el trato muy amable y un buen restaurante y desayuno.
Lo que pasa es que no está en una zona nada bonita, entre naves industriales y una zona residencial un poco ""decadente"", de las que no inspiran para darse una vuelta... y al estar frente al estadio te puede tocas mucho jaleo si hay partido.
Aunque se pueda acceder al centro andando, sin duda  la zona no es agradable. El hotel parece en las fotos que está a la rivera del río y en realidad, está lindando con unas vías del tranvía o tren. A su favor, está muy bien aislado.
Si se va a pasar un fin de semana, indudablemente elegiría algo mejor situado. No hemos estado mal pero no repetiría.",3,2013,08,29
211,Buen hotel,"El hotel está muy bien. Las habitaciones son amplias, limpias, nuevas y muy cómodas. También destacar que no es un hotel ruidoso. Las zonas comunes están muy bien y el bar es perfecto y acogerdor. Respecto al desayuno, tiene mucha variedad aunque a mi gusto, escaso en bollería. 
Desde el hotel al centro se puede ir andando en 25 min, sin problemas aunque la zona donde está situado no es precisamente de las mejores de Dublín. De día, ningún inconveniente, aunque de noche, regresábamos en taxi desde el centro (no es muy caro, 7-9 eur los cuatro de la familia).",4,2013,08,27
211,"Carinissimo, ma troppo distante dal centro","Bello ma per niente centrale. L'albergo è situato di fronte allo stadio Croke Park e per arrivare al centro (almeno a Connelly Street) c'è bisogno di una buona passeggiata (15min). Non ci sono fermate di autobus nei pressi dell'albergo, bisogna comunque percorrere dieci minuti per arrivare alla fermata più vicina. Se non si ha problemi per la distanza, lo straconsiglio: ottimo per pulizia, disponibilità personale, camere.",4,2013,08,26
211,hotel ottimo,"Ho soggiornato per una notte in questo hotel proprio nel mentre di una partita di hurling che si svolgeva tra le due principali città irlandesi di Dublino e Corke nello stadio davanti l'hotel..cosa dire se non tutto perfetto? nonostante la folla per la partita, che si riversava anche nell'hotel e nel pub dell'hotel, non si sono verificati incidenti spiacevoli, molto servizio di sicurezza e molta educazione da parte di tutti, in pieno spirito sportivo. nonostante quindi la numerosa folla siamo riusciti a cenare in tranquillità nel ristorante dell'hotel (porta accanto al pub) e a dormire sogni sereni in quanto nessun rumore ci ha disturbate.
veniamo alla descrizione:
- camera: ingresso e bagno pavimentati mentre zona letti con la moquette; condizionatore caldo/freddo che ha reso inutile la coperta aggiuntiva richiesta; piumini leggeri ma super caldi. camera prenotata per tre persone ma dato un letto matrimoniale + uno singolo (piccolo inconveniente) e all'arrivo presenti asciugamani e prodotti cortesi per il bagno solo per due persone, ma non appena avvisata la reception siamo stati subito riforniti.
- ristorante: ottimo sia come cibo che per la qualità del personale. siamo stati serviti da una ragazza che parlava molto bene l'italiano, rendendoci quindi più semplice la permanenza. cena piuttosto cara ma negli standard dei ristoranti irlandesi (una bottiglia d'acqua circa 5,60 euro), ma cibo ottimamente cucinato e gustoso.
- posizione perfetta, il centro dista solo 15 minuti a piedi andando quasi sempre dritti una volta usciti dall'hotel.
- pulizia ottima.
-colazione a buffet irlandese, presenti quindi sia cibi caldi (ova, salsiccia, fagioli, ecc.) sia un buffet dolce (mini cornetti di sfoglia e altri dolcetti di sfoglia, frutta in macedonia - sempre presente in ogni hotel il pompelmo), toast e pane sia bianco che integrale (il loro pane tipico), succhi, tea, caffè (quello lungo americano), latte, marmellate varie, burro, yougurt e cereali..insomma una colazione abbondante.

consiglio sicuramente questo hotel.",5,2013,08,20
211,Hotel cofortable y sin ruidos.,"Las habitaciones eran amplias y cómodas. Hasta el centro de Dublín,  hay unos 20/25 minutos andando. El buffet libre de la cena no era muy variado ni abundante. En los desayunos, la bollería era un poco escasa. El personal, muy amable y correcto.",4,2013,08,16
211,hotel ottimo,"siamo stati in quest hotel per fare un week end, e devo dire che è davvero tutto perfetto, dalla pulizia delle stanze, alla qualità del cibo a colazione, del parcheggio gratuito, e soprattutto dell'accoglienza del personale ottima.
il ristorante vicino (di cui non ricodrdiamo il nome) è davvero ottimo sia nella qualità, sia nel prezzo e offre davvero un'ampia gamma di pietanze.
Vicino al centro città e comodo con l'aeroporto",4,2013,08,14
211,Ottimo hotel,Ottimo hotel .tutto perfetto. La collocazione non è centrale ma dublino si può girare tranquillamente a piedi.posto sul retro dell' omonimo stadio icona degli sport gaelici.  Ottimo il ristorante italiano che si trova nella stessa via.nei dintorni non c è nulla. Consiglio di inserire la tv italiana e qualcuno che lo sappia un pò parlare.chiaramente questo è dovuto alla mia scarsa conoscenza dell' inglese ma il personale è gentilissimo e ci siamo intesi lo stesso.,5,2013,08,03
211,Hotel fantastico!,"Posizione ottima per raggiungere il centro a piedi in una ventina di minuti e perfetto per visitare Dublino! 
Per quanto riguarda la stanza i letti sono comodissimi (prenotando una doppia con letti singoli ci è stata assegnata una camera con un letto a una piazza e mezza e uno singolo), la pulizia impeccabile e le camere sono dotate di bollitore per fare tè e caffè. 
La colazione a buffet è davvero varia e di ottima qualità, dal dolce (latte, cereali, pane e marmellata, brioches ecc) al salato (salumi, salsicce, formaggi di vari tipi, uova, fagioli ecc). L'hotel si trova esattamente di fronte allo stadio e la nostra camera dava sulla ferrovia, ma nonostante questo non posso lamentarmi per il rumore. 
Consigliatissimo!",5,2013,07,28
211,Perfecto,"Nos hemos alojado en este hotel en nuestro circuito por Irlanda. Visitamos la web de Trip para ver las opiniones y tengo que decir que no se han alejado para nada de la realidad. El hotel es perfecto, completamente nuevo, limpio, las habitaciones bastante grandes y el desayuno muy variado.
Esta frente al estadio y muy cerca del centro en 20 mn paseando,despacito te pones en O´connel Street
No se le puede poner ninguna pega el aire acondicionado perfecto nos pillo la semana de temperaturas elevadísimas en Dublín y ningún problema",5,2013,07,20
211,Muy buen hotel algo alejado del centro,"Me gusto el hotel. Amplias habitaciones, cuidado mobiliario, amplias zonas comunes...
Un hotel cómodo desde donde conocer Dublín sin precisar transporte publico, siempre que caminar no sea un problema, pues en 30 minutos puedes llegar a O,Conell, arteria principal de la cuidad.
A la habitación no se le pueden poner pegas, amplias, limpias y bien equipadas.
El desayuno de excelente calidad y muy variado. 
Volvería pues a pesar de estar alejado del centro, la calidad del establecimiento compensa el paseo.
Y del areopuerto, un taxi por unos 23 euros, por lo que si sois 3 o 4 no merece la pena merece la pena no usar transporte publico",4,2013,07,15
211,esplendida relación calidad precio,"Una excelente ´calidad y relación calidad-precio, el unico inconveniente para algunos puede ser que no esta centrico, pero se accede facilmente desde el aeropuerto (línea 16, aircoach,etc.) y desde el cercano parque Mountjouy Square salen autobuses al centro, y esto ayuda a conocer de dublin algo más que el centro.",4,2013,07,12
211,Buon albergo non troppo lontano dal centro!,"Abbiamo scelto questo hotel perchè trovato sul sito Splendia.com che uso solitamente per i viaggi internazionali.
La tariffa era molto buona e le recensioni su internet altrettanto buone quindi abbiamo prenotato.
Albergo pulito, funzionale e di gran confort.
La nostra stanza era una superior, con bagno molto grande (doccia e vasca) ben pulito anche se con alcune pecche: la vasca aveva solo il rubinetto e non anche la doccettina per potersi sciaquare una volta insaponati, la doccia aveva solo la doccetta fissa, ribadisco che si tratta di dettagli e di consigli da albergatore ad albergatore.
Ottimo il sistema wi-fi che semplicemente, velocemente e in maniera gratuita vi permette di collegarvi e navigare in ogni angolo dell'albergo.
La distanza dal centro non è molta ed a piedi si può raggiungere in 15/20 minuti, ma ci hanno sconsigliato di farlo soprattutto la sera/notte e quindi abbiamo sempre preso il taxi spendendo una media di 8 euro a tratta.
Ottimo il servizio concierge e il ricevimento

a presto",4,2013,06,24
211,"Hotel stupendo, pulito e con personale professionale e gentile","Ho soggiornato in questo hotel con una vacanza organizzata. A primo impatto si capisce subito che si tratta di un hotel che sa cosa e come offrire un 4 stelle. Il personale si è dimostrato immediatamente cortese e professionale, in un attimo abbiamo raggiunto subito le camere. Le stanze sono stupende, moquette e pavimento normale nel bagno e all'ingresso. Il water è separato dal resto del bagno in una stanzina separata. La doccia è enorme ed è presente anche la vasca, il lavandino ha diversi piani di appoggio e sono provviste anche di vari oggetti di cortesia. La pulzia della camera e il cambio della biancheria è quotidiana, come ogni 4 stelle che si rispetti. C'è il frigobar, la TV, un impianto audio, la scrivania con penne e block notes in più c'è anche un armadio con molti appendi abiti. Il resto della struttura è fantastico, titto molto pulito e curato nei dettagli. Il personale parla diverse lingue tra cui anche l'italiano ed è a vostra completa disposizione per qualsiasi cosa: prenotazione taxi e ristoranti, consigli sui punti di interesse e altro. In una camera mancava la luce e dopo aver avvisato la hall, sono intervenuti immediatamente e in 15min il problema è stato risolto. Che altro dire, un hotel eccezionale.",5,2013,06,17
211,Ottimo,"Ho scelto questa struttura quasi ""costretta"", fra un due stelle in centro alla modica cifra di 500 euro e questo 4 stelle a meno di 400 (entrambi colazione esclusa) ho pensato di optare per il lusso anche se un po' lontano dal centro.
Fortunatamente posso dire di non essermi pentita della scelta fatta, il centro si raggiunge facilmente sia a piedi sia in bus, quindi va piu' che bene se, come me, trovate una buona offerta e dovete rimanere in citta' solo per qualche giorno.
Tutto curato nei minimi particolari: l'arredo, la cura per il cliente, le stanze bene accessoriate e pulite, la colazione abbondante. Ho particolarmente apprezzato la comodita' del letto e dei guanciali, sembrava di sprofondare in dei batuffoli di cotone. 
Al check out ci hanno offerto due mezze naturali da portare con noi, cosa che non mi era capitata in altri hotel della stessa categoria.",5,2013,05,21
211,Comodità e qualità non lontano dal centro,"E' la classica struttura moderna e curata che si trova nelle periferie delle grandi città, ma in questo caso è ben collegata al centro e comoda da raggiungere; bastano 10 minuti a piedi per arrivare alla fermata del bus che in altri 10 minuti ti porta in O'Connell Street, oppure se si ama camminare in 30-35 minuti a piedi si raggiunge il cuore della città.
E' situato proprio di fronte all'omonimo maestoso stadio di cricket, ma la zona è tranquilla e occupata da tante abitazioni medio borghesi.
Le camere sono spaziose e ben accessoriate, e curate nei dettagli e nella pulizia. Il tutto a prezzi più che ragionevoli, in competizione con strutture ben più modeste e datate.
Consigliatissimo!",4,2013,04,15
211,Posizione un pò infelice,"Un bel hotel a 4 stelle, con stanze e bagni da evidenziare per la dotazione e gli spazi. Wifi gratuito in tutto l'hotel, colazione abbondante e un ampio bar con grande schermo tv.
L'unica, leggera, nota dolente è forse la posizione. E' sicuramente perfetto per lo stadio di Croke Park, dall'altra parte della strada. Oggi usato per i giochi gaelici che vi invito ad andare a vedere perché veramente particolari e poco conosciuti, ma che rappresentano molto bene gli irlandesi. Per raggiungere il centro di Dublino mettete in conto una passeggiata di almeno 20 minuti o il taxi. A circa 10 minuti a piedi c'è anche una stazione dei treni (Drumcondra Station), una sorta di metropolitana leggera e di superficie. Prezzo forse leggermente alto, se fosse posizionato più centro sarebbe perfetto.",4,2013,04,14
211,Hotel piacevole e accogliente,"Mi è capitata la primavera peggiore degli ultimi 50 anni a Dublino: pioggia, neve, grandine, vento e freddo! Unica nota positiva: il Croke Park Hotel! Bello, caldo, luminoso, camere grandi, letti queen size, bagno perfetto con vasca e doccia. TV semplice da azionare. Necessaire per tè e caffè completo, con biscottini. 
La colazione: ricca, varia, buonissima, ma soprattutto, non ho dovuto subire la solita colazione in solitaria, perché una deliziosa ragazza italiana mi ha accolto, mi ha consigliata nel modo migliore e mi ha  fatto sentire proprio a mio agio. Si è poi preoccupata di tradurmi le indicazioni del concierge per una visita piacevole della città e dintorni. Un tesoro, 
Unico neo dell’hotel, la lontananza dal centro. Si può ovviare usufruendo della navetta gratuita che porta in centro. ma solo due volte al giorno, con una lunga passeggiata o con una decina di euro per il taxi, soprattutto per il ritorno. Un’ottima vacanza perciò nonostante il tempo inclemente. Lo consiglio vivamente.",5,2013,04,08
211,Schönes Hotel etwas außerhalb der Innenstadt,"Das 4-Sterne-Hotel liegt gegenüber dem 82.300 Zuschauer fassenden Croke Stadium. Vom Flughafen Dublin erreicht man das Hotel z.B. mit dem Aircoach Bus (6 Euro) oder dem Dublin Bus (#16, 41). Beide halten an der Drumcondra Station, von der es ein Katzensprung zum Hotel ist. Zu Fuß sind es bis zum nördlichen Ende der O'Connell Street etwa 15 Min. und bis zum Trinity Collage ca. 30 Min. Alternativ fahren ab Dorset St. (8 Min. Fußweg) einige Busse in die Innenstadt. Wir hatten ein Deluxe Doppelzimmer gebucht, das im obersten, vierten Stockwerk lag. Das geräumige, saubere Zimmer war modern ausgestattet (inkl. LCD-TV, Wasserkocher, Fön, kostenloses WLAN und Safe). Das Bad hatte sowohl eine Badewanne als auch eine Dusche sowie genügend Ablageflächen. Im Zimmerpreis (nur Deluxe) war ein ordentliches kontinentales Frühstück in der Executive Lounge und Gutscheine für die Bar (1 Getränke p.p.p.N) enthalten. Das Personal war freundlich, hilfsbereit und effektiv. In der Lobby stehen PC und Drucker, die man z.B. für den Online-Check-In seines Fluges nutzen kann.",4,2013,04,07
211,Fenomenal,"Nos alojamos en este hotel 5 días en las vacaciones de Pascua. Es un hotel nuevo y muy bonito. Los empleados son muy amables y el desayuno es muy bueno y completo. Las habitaciones son bastante grandes y las camas son muy cómodas. Además está muy bien situado en frente del estadio Croke Park de ""Gaelic Football"" y en 15 minutos estás en O""Conell Street y en Henry Street. Recomiendo este hotel.",5,2013,03,31
211,Hervorragendes Hotel,"Dieses Hotel ist - bis auf die Lage ca. 20 min zu Fuß vom Stadtzentrum - hervorragend. Tolle, große Zimmer, sehr gutes Frühstück und sehr zuvorkommende Mitarbeiter. Sicher das beste Stadthotel, welches ich die letzten Jahre besucht habe ...",5,2013,03,28
211,Ottimo rapporto qualità prezzo,"Hotel moderno, pulizia ottima, a 20 minuti di cammino dal centro e vicinissimo a fermate dell'autobus. La zona è tranquilla, residenziale, e l'hotel è proprio di fronte allo stadio. Receptionist cortesi, colazione a buffet abbondante (a scelta tra Irish e continentale). Servizi nelle stanze ottimi e funzionali. Consigliato",4,2013,03,27
211,"Lage in schlechter Umgebung, Zimmer riesig","Dieses Hotel liegt direkt neben dem Stadium, auf dessen hässliche Außenfassade man von den Zimmern auch blickt. Drumherum ist absolut nichts los, wenn nicht gerade ein Spiel ist. Für eine Städtereise ist diese Lage nicht zu empfehlen.
Die Rezeption ist nicht sehr freundlich. Die Aufzüge kann man nur in Gang setzen mit der Schlüsselkarte, was positiv und sicher ist.
Die Zimmer sind sehr groß. Es gibt einen CD/MP3-Player im Zimmer, CDs kann man sich an der Rezeption ausleiden. Wifi und Kabelanschluß im Zimmer sind gut und kostenlos. Das Bad lässt nichts zu wünschen übrig, bei mir gab es eine Dusche und extra eine Badewanne. Minibar ist auch vorhanden.
Das Abendessen im Bistro war sehr gut, auch ein sehr netter Service, allerdings war außer uns auch kaum jemand da. Das Servicepersonal bestand fast nur aus ausländischen Kräften, dier aber Englisch sprachen. Die Getränke sind sehr teuer. 
Das Frühstück war sehr enttäuschend. Zwar ist alles auf einem Buffet gut angeordnet, auch das warme Essen. Doch das war eher lauwarm und geschmacklos. Und das obwohl ich um kurz vor 7 Uhr dort war, das Restaurant um 6:30 Uhr aufmacht. Wir kalt wird das Essen dann erst wohl später werden??? Der Frühstücksservice war eine absolute Katastrophe. Erst nachdem ich bereits meinen ersten Teller fertig gegessen hatte, ließ sich überhaupt eine Bedienung im Lokal blicken, die mich auch erst nach meinem Rufen bemerkte.Sie brachte meinen Kaffee dann auch sehr unfreundlich an den Tisch. Auch hier war das Restaurant noch ziemlich leer.
Insgesamt von den Zimmern abgesehen würde ich dieses Hotel nicht empfehlen.",3,2013,03,15
211,Buena opción,"Hotel nuevo y moderno. 
En media hora estás en el centro y el trayecto es tranquilo. Compensa su situación con las excelentes instalaciones y servicios.
Desde el aeropuerto, el taxi te cuesta 20 euros y tarda 15 minutos, así que si vais 2 parejas sale mejor que el aircoach ida y vuelta...
Las habitaciones son amplias, buena cama, cafetera, ducha y bañera...
El desayuno buffet cuesta 15 euros y es muy completo. Una española es la encargada del restaurante y está pendiente de todo: te ofrece café ""decente"" en vez del de puchero que te dejan en la mesa y te aconseja sobre tu visita a Dublín... (Sonia, Tranks for all!)",5,2013,03,04
211,Maravillosa estancia.,"Me aloje en el hotel el fin de semana de Halloween y el maratón de Dublín. No pude acertar más. El hotel es maravilloso. Está alejado del centro, pero no a más de 15 minutos del centro andando y compensa de sobra, por instalaciones, servicios, atención y sobre todo por comodidad y tranquilidad. Justo en frente el estadio de futbol gaélico, que puede ser otro punto más a favor si te gusta el deporte, pero un hotel de lujo en todas sus facetas. Desayuno no muy variado pero abundante. Quedé encantando por el trato recibido, aunque si tuviera que poner alguna pega sería que (de manera incomprensible) a veces se veían carros del servicio de limpieza a cualquier hora en el pasillo con toallas y vasos sucios, que no daban la imagen que merece este hotel. Apuesta segura para tu viaje a Dublín, yo no lo dudaría.",5,2013,02,05
211,Muy buen hotel,"La estancia ha sido de 3 días y ha sido todo estupendo. Hotel muy limpio, habitación muy grande con todo tipo de comodidades - tetera, cadena de música, secador, plancha, tabla de secado,...- baño con bañera y ducha independientes, desayuno -incluido en nuestro caso- excelente y variado (irlandés y mediterráneo) y atención muy buena.
Solamente indicar que está alejado del centro (15 minutos andando), pero compensa si obtienes un buen precio en la habitación.",5,2013,01,31
211,Grande cortesia,"Per il nuovo anno ho deciso di concedermi una vacanza in Irlanda con tutta la famiglia.Mai scelta si rivelo'migliore perche'l'isola e'fantastica e la gente cortesissima.Abbiamo soggiornato in una stanza familiare al the Croke Park Hotel e ci siamo trovati benissimo. Stanza con 2 letti matrimoniali molto spaziosa e accogliente,bagno con doccia e vasca e finanche l'aspiratore perfettamente funzionante.Staff sempre a tua completa disposizione pronti a soddisfare  ogni richiesta.Siamo stati anche ben consigliati sui tours fuori dublino da fare o da evitare. Compresa nel prezzo l'irish breakfast con buffet salato e dolce molto fornito. 
Rapporto qualita'prezzo ottimo.hotel molto pulito e il centro facilmente raggiungibile con una passeggiata di circa 10 minuti.Lo consiglio a tutti.
rachele Salerno",5,2013,01,10
211,Demasiado lejos,"El hotel está muy bien, pero en mi opinión ,no merece la pena por lo alejado que se encuentra de la zona turística.
Es cierto, que en 15 minutos andando llegas al comienzo de la calle O' Connell, pero realmente lo céntrico y donde se encuentra todo lo visitable está al otro lado del río Liffey: Temple Bar, Trinity College, Grafton Street, Catedral de San Patricio...etc y para llegar a esta zona tienes otros 10-15min. desde el comienzo de O' Connell.
Otra opción es llegar al centro en autobús,(la parada no está en la puerta del hotel), se encuentra a unos 8-10 min. andando. Pasan varios autobuses que bajan a O' Connell y al Temple bar, puedes pagar el billete en el bus, pero el precio exacto, ya que no devuelven cambio, el precio varia según el nº de estaciones.(por la noche cambian precios y horarios). Un taxi al hotel desde el Temple Bar son 9€.
En otras ocasiones, también nos hemos alojado en hoteles algo retirados del centro y no nos ha supuesto ningún inconveniente, pero en este caso me ha parecido que estaba excesivamente lejos, mal comunicado y en una zona algo aislada ya que una vez que abandonas O' Connell hasta el hotel no se puede decir que sea un paseo agradable.",3,2013,01,09
211,Personal super amable,"El hotel lo tiene todo, aunque no es centrico , se tarda muy poco en llegar andando.

A dublino non c'è la metro quindi l'hotel risulta un pò fuori mano, cmq la citta è piccola e a piedi ci vogliono circa 15/20 minuti per il centro. La zona è tranquilla e un pò carente di servizi. L'hotel si trova letteralmente di fronte allo stadio Croke Park. Per arrivare in centro cmq è davvero facile e intuitivo anche senza bus e mappa. Dublino è una piccola città a misura d'uomo non esistono grandi distanze. Molto carina.",4,2012,12,23
211,"Bellissime stanze,buono il servizio e la cucina.","Sono stata al Croke Park Hotel un weekend di fine Novembre.Appena arrivati ci hanno dato dei fazzoletti caldi e profumati per riscaldarci le mani e sono stati molto pazienti visto che non sapevamo bene la lingua. La stanza è impeccabile come si vede dalle foto , si dorme molto bene,è dotata di radio,televisore,tè,minibar,cassaforte,ferro da stiro, una doccia e una vasca favolosi, phon (ricordatevi che la presa in Irlanda è diversa dalla nostra ! ).  Per quanto riguarda la colazione ce n'è davvero per tutti i gusti dal dolce al salato, a richiesta viene portato del pane tostato bianco o integrale e thè , cappuccino,caffè ecc. Il personale è molto gentile anche durante la cena di cui abbiamo usufruito. Io personalemente ho preso il salmone con le patate e il porro ,delle verdure al vapore e formaggio di capra fuso con fagiolini e noci. Se lo trovate in menù , consiglio vivamente , non credevo potessi mangiare così bene fuori dall'Italia ! 
La posizione invece è un po' fuori mano , c'è a breve distanza una fermata servita spesso dal Dublin Bus che porta al centro, solo che con la stanchezza magari di sera e con pioggia può risultare pesante. Non so dirvi dei prezzi perchè è un viaggio che mi è stato offerto !",5,2012,12,18

Wir kamen mitten zum Semifinale des Gaelic Football im nebenan liegenden Croke Park Stadium und ein Teil der 65.000 Besucher aus Donegal und Cork feierten schon davor im Hotel.
Trotzdem wurden wir rasch und freundlich empfangen und hatten eine ruhige Nacht.
Die Zimmer sind schön, modern und geräumig, der einzige (bereits von anderen erwähnte) Nachteil ist die Lage.
Das Shuttle Service in die Stadt läuft nur bis 14.30, aber die öffentlichen Verkehrsmittel (z.B. Buslinie 13) kommen nah genug heran, die letzten Meter kann man am Kanal entlang gehen.
Ich war 3 Tage lang hauptsächlich zu Fuß unterwegs und fand den Weg zur O'Connell Street unschwierig und bei zügiger Gangart in 10 Minuten leicht bewältigbar.

En todo momento nos hemos sentido como en casa. Las habitaciones son grandes, con un gran ventanal, un escritorio, TV plana, secador bueno (como el de casa), dos armarios, plancha y tabla de planchar, mesita y butaca y acceso a internet. No se oyen ruidos de ningún tipo. 
El baño es enorme, cuenta con ducha y bañera aparte, lavabo y WC. 
El desayuno de buffet estilo continental o Irlandés es muy bueno, la sala es confortable y el servicio muy atento.
Las instalaciones son estupendas. Cuenta con varias estancias: una biblioteca, un salón con pantalla XXL para ver los partidos, con su chimemea, varias salitas para leer o esperar y todas con acceso WI-FI. 
Si lo necesitas hay personal que habla español.",5,2012,06,19
211,Business Hotel mit Seele,"Im Grunde genommen handelt es sich beim Croke Park Hotel um ein wirklich sehr schönes und gutes Business Hotel über 4 Ebenen, welches alle Annehmlichkeiten bietet, die ein Geschäftsreisender sucht:

+ Sehr gute Betten
+ Saubere, moderne Zimmer
+ Gutes Frühstück
+ Fitnessraum
+ Freies Internet
+ tgl. Shuttle zum EastPoint Business Park

ABER...dies würde dem Hotel und vor allen den Angestellten dieses Hotels keinesfalls gerecht werden, denn dieses Hotel hat Eines, welches ich bei sehr vielen anderen Hotels vermisse...es hat ein Herz und eine Seele! ich reise sehr viel und oft (besonders nach Irland) und sämtliche Angestellten, vom Empfang/ Concierge angefangen, über die Security, bis hin zum wunderbaren Shuttlebusfahrer, geben mir jedes Mal das Gefühl, wirklich ein zweites Zuhause zu haben. Man merkt den Angestellten einfach an, dass mit Herz und Seele bei der Sache sind, Ihre Aufgaben ernst nehmen, ohne dabei das Lächeln und das gemeinsame Lachen zu vergessen.

Es sind die Angestellten, die dieses Hotel zu meinem absoluten Lieblingshotel in Irland machen! Daher kann ich dieses Hotel nach besten Wissen und Gewissen jedem nur ans Herz legen!",5,2012,05,31
211,Perfetto!,"Siamo appena rientrati dalla bellissima Dublino, dove abbiamo soggiornato presso il Croke Park Hotel. L'albergo merita assolutamente le 4 stelle, per pulizia, dimensioni delle stanze, cortesia e caratteristiche della struttura. La camera (al primo piano) era spaziosissima, dotata di tv e stereo con lettore CD, asse e ferro da stiro, bollitore elettrico e altri comfort; il bagno aveva sia la doccia che la vasca. La colazione abbondante e varia. Il centro è raggiungibile a piedi in circa 15 minuti, ma la zona è veramente tranquilla anche la sera tardi. Inoltre è molto comodo per chi arriva dall'aeroporto e utilizza il servizio navetta Aircoach (la fermata è a breve distanza dall'hotel).
Ci torneremo sicuramente!",4,2012,05,27
211,"Gutes Hotel, aber nicht total zentral gelegen.","Das Hotel befindet sich in der Nähe eines berühmten Stadions namens Croke Park. Bis in die Innenstadt, d.h. z.B. O'Connell Street sind es zu Fuß ca. 20-30 Minuten. In unserem Zimmer befand sich ein Doppelbett und ein EInzelbett. Es gibt im Bad sowohl eine Dusche als auch eine Badewanne. Beim Abendessen war die Auswahl am Buffet nicht groß, aber das Essen schmackhaft. In der Lobby gibt es Free WLAN, im Zimmer nicht. Das Internet im Zimmer kostet 5€ pro Tag. Das Frühstücksbuffet war sehr gut. Es gab frisches Obst. Besonders empfehlen kann aber ich das Rhabarberkompott. Was ich als sehr umständlich empfand war, daß man beim Liftfahren die Zimmerkarte einstecken mußte, um hochzufahren. Hinab benötigt man übrigens keine Karte. Insgesamt ist das Hotel empfehlenswert. Einen Pool gibt es nicht.",4,2012,05,25
211,Gute Ausgangslage für Stadteurlaub,"Das Hotel befindet sich in einer ruhigen Lage und bietet somit den idealen Ausgangspunkt für Dublin an.
Zu Fuß erreicht man in 10-15 Minuten den River Liffey/ Morgens wird auch ein gratis Shuttle angeboten.
Das Personal ist freundlich uns bemüht alle Wünschen nach zu kommen. Die Zimmer sind sehr sauber mit einer guten Ausstattung. Unser Raum wurde täglich ausbereitet.
Die Aufbuchung auf Executive bei unserer Ankunft ermöglichte uns Zugang zur Executive Lounge (Ruhebereich mit Freigetränken), einem Gutschein für die Hotelbar und getrenntem Frühstück in der Lounge (KEIN irisches Frühstück, sondern ausgiebig/hochwertig kontinental).",5,2012,05,22
211,Pasqua a Dublino,"Consigliabile soprattutto a famiglie con bambini: offre camere pulite e spaziose, letti estremamente confortevoli, un ristorante con colazione sia all'inglese che classica con grande varietà e abbondanza, menu specifici per bambini e un servizio di nursery davvero comodo, con giochi e attività proprio per i più piccoli. C'è anche una palestra e la sera il bar diventa piano bar, a Pasqua anche con musica dal vivo. Lo staff è disponibile e accogliente, c'è un parcheggio auto gratuito. La distanza dal centro non costituisce un grande problema. Giudizio: ottimo",4,2012,04,23
211,schönes Hotel direkt am Croke Park Stadion,"Wir verbrachten 3 Nächte in diesem Hotel. Der Preis war ausgezeichnet, die Zimmer sehr schön und sauber. Freundliche Mitarbeiter und ein Heißgetränk zum Empfang. Wir hatten Frühstück mitgebucht und waren sehr froh darüber. Eine gute Auswahl an kontinentalen und irischen Speisen. Das Hotel liegt etwas außerhalb des Zentrums. Dieses lässt sich allerdings per Bus und durch einen kurzen Spaziergang schnell erreichen.",5,2012,04,21
211,"""Muy buena relación calidad-precio""","Magnífico hotel. Personal muy educado y atento. Buenas prestaciones. Desayuno continental muy completo. Lo único, su ubicación, 10-15 minutos andando del centro de la ciudad. Sin duda me volveré a hospedar aquí si vuelvo a visitar Dublín.",5,2012,04,17
211,"Me esperaba más, pero buen hotel","En general el hotel está muy bien, aunque un poco alejado del centro, pero nosotros ya lo sabíamos al coger este hotel. El personal muy atento. Nosotros cogimos una habitación Deluxe con cama ""Queen size"" pero al llegar a la habitación había una cama ""Double"" y una pequeña, pero bueno, no dijimos nada y nos quedamos en esta habitación. Una cosa que no sabíamos, al hacer el ""check-in"" es que te retienen en tu cuenta casi el doble de dinero de lo que tienes que pagar, pero a los pocos días de hacer el check-out, te lo devuelven.

A continuación os digo puntos negativos y puntos positivos sobre el hotel.

Negativos:
 -No hay escobilla del water en los baños.
 -Desayuno poco variado, tienen bastante para escoger, pero no cambia cada día.
 -Escasos complementos de baño(no ponen acondicionador de pelo por ejemplo, ni esponja).
 -Luz del reloj del televisor bastante intensa, por lo que puede molestar al dormir.
 -Ruido del aire acondicionado.

Positivos:
 -El personal muy atento, cada noche teníamos un bombón para cada uno en la mesita de noche y nos dejaban el albornoz sobre la cama.
 -Zapatillas de rizo. Para mí son imprescindibles, y no todos los hoteles de esta categoría las ponen.
 -El restaurante excelente, al contrario de los desayunos, si comeis o cenais algún día en el restaurante, no os arrepentiréis. Excelente cocina.
Espero que os sirva de ayuda. Disfrutad la estancia. Un saludo.",4,2012,04,14
211,HOTEL CASI PERFECTO,"Hemos estado 4 parejas durante 5 noches en este hotel en esta Semana Santa.

He estado dudando entre si ponerle 4 ó 5 puntos.

He estado dudando, no por el hotel en si, que claramente es de 5, sino porque para valorar tambien se tiene que tener en cuenta, donde esta situado y eso, en este caso, bajaría la puntuación.

El hotel, como hotel de ciudad, es casi perfecto, las habitaciones son muy buenas, muy limpias, las camas muy comodas, el cuarto de baño muy completo con gran ducha y gran bañera, con secador, buenas toallas, albornoz, toda clase de gel, champus..., la habitación con  televisión, caja fuerte, minibar, equipo de música, plancha, planchador de pantalones, telefonos con acceso a otras habitaciones, cafe caliente, muchas lamparas, zona para escribir, zona para comer y zona para leer.  En la habitación hay internet por cable, es decir, si tienes un portatil lo puedes enchufar, pero no hay wifi, en la zona de recepción si hay wifi. Todo de gran calidad y muy nuevo.

El desayuno perfecto, con fruta fresca, zumos, irish breakfast, varias clases de cafes, cereales, tostadas, jamon, queso, bolleria........

El restaurante, muy bueno y mas barato que en la calle.

El personal muy simpatico y muy servicial. Muy buen personal.

Solo tuvimos un pequeño malentendido con Terry, un camarero  que nos atendió varias noches. El malentendido, visto friamente, fue por culpa de falta de conocimiento de las costumbres del lugar (raras costumbres).

Era Viernes Santo, sabiamos que habia una ley que prohibia servir alcohol ese dia en restaurantes y pubs, pero que en los hoteles estaba permitido. Estuvimos todo el dia de excursión en la zona de Wiklow. Volvimos tarde y cansados al hotel y decidimos no salir esa noche. Despues de descansar un rato, bajamos todo el grupo a cenar a la cafeteria, eran las 9,30 p.m.. Vimos que en las demas mesas la gente bebia cerveza y vino. Despues de esperar casi 20 minutos sin que nos atendiera nadie, se acercó Terry, simpatico camarero, o por lo menos ese era el concepto que teniamos de él. Le pedimos 8 pintas y nos dijo que no, que a partir de las 9 no se servia ni bebida ni comida por que era Viernes Santo. Creiamos que era broma porque estabamos rodeados de gente bebiendo y comiendo. Le insistimos y él repetia una y otra vez que no era broma, que esa gente habia pedido esa comida y esa bebida antes de las 9. Le insistimos tanto que se enfadó un poco, recogió los menus que teniamos y se fué.

Fuimos a recepción  a protestar, llevabamos 20 minutos esperando y nos veiamos 8 personas, con hambre y sed y sin posibilidad de cenar. Entendiamos que esto lo deberian haber comunicado poniendo carteles en los ascensores, en recepción o algo así y no que nos cogiera de sorpresa. No sirvió de nada y además nos dijeron que a partir de las 10, que eran ya, tampoco habia servicio de habitaciones.

Vimos que gente entraba en el hotel con bolsas de comida rapida así que salimos del hotel y nos fuimos andando a buscar un sitio de comida para llevar. Terminamos comiendo un poco de comida basura en las habitaciones con una cocacola.

Todo esto nos fastidio mucho la noche.

El hotel esta en un barrio de clase media-baja, con pocos casi ningún bar alrededor y a unos  20 minutos andando, si no te pierdes, a donde comienza ""la civilización"". Nosotros casi siempre cogiamos taxis, unos 15 € al centro un taxi para 8 personas, barato. Taxis es lo que mas hay en Dublin.

Para colmo cogimos una oferta de 59 € por habitación/noche con desayuno incluido, increible para este hotel.

Por supuesto recomiendo el hotel, sabiendo que esta lejos del centro, en no la mejor zona de Dublin y que nadie habla ningún idioma que no sea el ingles.",5,2012,04,09
211,Hotel in guter Lage in Dublin,"Das Croke Park Hotel ist in erster Linie ein gut geführtes Businesshotel der gehobenen Kategorie, aber auch für einen privaten Städtetrip gut geeignet. Es bietet keinen besonderen individuellen Charme, ist aber komfortabel und recht ansprechend eingerichtet. 

Zu Fuß ist man in der Innenstadt in ca. 20 Minuten. Zum Flughafen benötigt man je nach Verkehrsmittel Taxi ca. 10 min (€ 25,00), Airportbus ca. 20 min (€ 7,00) und einem normalen Stadtbus ca. 40 min (€ 2,50) mit Fußweg von ca. 10 min bis zum Hotel.  

Die Zimmer sind ausreichend groß mit einem schönem Bad und zum Innenhof gelegen sehr ruhig. WLAN funktioniert in den Zimmern und wird kostenfrei angeboten.

Rezeption und der Service im Restaurantbereich ( Frühstück ) sind einwandfrei. Das Frühstück bietet mit "" full irish breakfast "" alles, was man für einen guten Start in den Tag  benötigt. Trotz großen Andrangs kommen die Servicekräfte hiermit sehr gut zurecht. Es wird immer alles ohne Nachfrage sofort nachgelegt. Es gibt auch ausreichend Fruchtsäfte, Obst, Quark und Müslis.

Das Restaurant bietet abends auch verschiedene Menüs, was wir jedoch nicht ausprobiert haben. Man kann es sich zu späterer Stunde auch in der Lounge mit einem Getränk sehr gemütlich machen.",4,2012,04,03
211,Eccellente e di classe,"Voto assolutamente positivo per la struttura. L'ubicazione non è tra le migliori, bisogna camminare 5 minuti a piedi per raggiungere la prima fermata utile dei bus, ma il comfort e i servizi offerti rendono questo piccolo difetto quasi impercettibile.
Un letto enorme e altissimo, radio con lettore cd, accesso ad internet, un bagno con doccia e vasca, teiera, cassaforte, frigobar e non ricordo cos'altro!
Il personale è stato cordialissimo, hanno esaudito ogni nostra richiesta con garbo e professionalità. 
La colazione ci è piaciuta, la scelta è tra la solita combinazione di latte-cereali-succhi di frutta alla classica colazione all'inglese, con bacon, white pudding, black pudding, toast, fagioli.

Ci sono stato 3 notti con un'offerta letsbonus, che non smetterò mai di osannare.",5,2012,04,01
211,"Solides, sauberes Hotel","Wir haben dieses Hotel als Anlaufpunkt für unsere Übernachtung in Dublin genommen und wurden nicht enttäuscht. Der Preis ist bei der Güte des Hotels hervorragend. Die Bar ist gut (macht lecker Sandwiches auch zum Mitnehmen) und schenkt natürlich nicht zu knapp Guinnes aus. Die Lage ist nicht überragend schön, aber zentral und wenn eine Veranstaltung im Croke Park sein sollte, könnte das eine gute Gelgenheit ergeben. Parkplätze umsonst, WLan immerhin in der Lobby, auf den Zimmern per Kabel, immer 2 Betten im Zimmer, ein Einzel und ein Doppel. Auch ein Vorteil: vom Flughafen ist man in 10-15 Minuten dort und in der Nähe gibts auch gleich Europcar.",4,2012,03,30
211,Croke Park Hotel Dublin,"Für einen Kurztrip für 4 Tage haben wir dieses Hotel ausgewählt über die Air Lingus-Angebote für Dublin. Das Hotel liegt in einer ruhigen Gegend (es war auch gerade keine größere Veranstaltung im Croke-Park Stadion. Im Hotel alles sehr ordentlich und sauber, freundliche Angestellte. 
Man ist in kürzester Zeit im Stadtzentrum, die Busse fahren ca. alle 10 Minuten, selbst zu Fuss ist man in ca. 25 Minuten im Zentrum. Für Erstbesucher in Dublin, der Sightseeing Bus (Hop on - hop off) fährt am Wochenende zu ausgewählten Zeiten auch direkt vorm Hotel ab.
Wir haben ohne Frühstück gebucht, können also deshalb dazu keinerlei Aussage treffen. Bei einem nächsten Besuch würde ich dieses Hotel wieder wählen.",4,2012,03,12
211,Un bell'albergo fuori dal centro,"Il Croke Park Hotel e' situato vicino al Croke Stadium, in una zona residenziale nella zona nord di Dublino.
La struttura e' recente, ben tenuta e completa di ogni comfort.
Buona la colazione e la pulizia delle camere.
Si trova a circa 1km dalla stazione degli autobus, ma in compenso sulla tratta principale che collega l'aereoporto con il centro citta' e quindi servita da diverse linee di autobus.
Il personale e' gentile e la clientela di tipo internazionale.
In camera trovate aria condizionata,  flat tv, stereo, phon e bollitore.
Nella hall sono disponibili gratuitamente due postazioni interner e tutta la zona reception e' servita anche da free internet in wifi.
Decisamente un buon albergo.",4,2012,03,07
211,Immer wieder gerne,"Tolles Zimmer, wir hatten Twin Beds. Jedes Bett hatte Queen Size. Unglaublich guter und zuvorkommender Service und die Einkaufsstraße ist binnen 10 Minuten zu Fuß gut zu erreichen. Das Hotel liegt direkt am Stadion (falls jemand Rugby-Fan ist). Da kein Spiel war, war es sehr ruhig und in 5 Minuten schafft man es auch vom/bis zum Bus Richtung Flughafen.",5,2012,01,23
211,Ultimo dell'anno a Dublino,"Riguardo l'hotel niente da dire , come hanno scritto tutti gli altri che vi hanno alloggiato il personale e' molto disponibile e gentile , la struttura molto accogliente , pulita , camere con ogni comfort dal climatizzatore , radio con lettore cd , tv satellitare con possibilita' di film a pagamento , accesso a internet libero , frigobar , asse e ferro da stiro , piegapantaloni , teiera elettrica e set di tazze per la preparazione di bevande calde , un ottimo bagno dotato di vasca piu ampia doccia sul lato opposto e inoltre possibilita' di servizio colazione in camera . Al pian  terreno si puo' usufruire del ristorante(io non l'ho testato), di un ottimo bar dove potersi rilassare bevendo una birra o un cocktail , adagiati su comode poltrone e inoltre poter utilizzare tanti altri servizi.
La posizione anche se non molto centrale alla citta' non e' male , l'hotel si trova esattamente a fianco dello stadio del rugby(se non erro , altrimenti del calcio) zona abbastanza tranquilla non molto trafficata , dalla quale se non si vuole prendere un taxi si puo' raggiungere le zone della movida di Dublino a piedi in 15 minuti circa.
Io ho prenotato questo hotel assieme al volo tramite expedia a un prezzo molto soddisfacente , per cui salvo i prezzi che potrebbero variare a seconda del periodo  o della prenotazione lo consiglio vivamente .",5,2012,01,06
211,"Me ha gustado mucho, aunque un poco lejos del centro","Estuvimos 4 noches en una oferte de alojamiento y desayuno. Nos regalaron 1 copa cada día en su bar (que suele tener siempre buen ambiente). Habitación grande y cómoda, aunque poca luz y en el baño no hay calefacción. El desayuno continental es fantástico.
Está alejado del centro y no hay restaurantes cerca.",4,2012,01,05
211,Tornerei volentieri,"Ottimo Hotel alle spalle del celebre stadio di Dublino. Dalle recensioni che ho letto sembra quasi che questo albergo sia fuori mano, invece con una passeggiata di 10-15 minuti siete in centro ed in ogni caso i taxi per rientrare la sera non sono mai stati troppo onerosi. Camere spaziose, letto stra-comodo, pulitissimo. Personale cordiale e professionale. Davvero ineccepibile.",5,2011,11,28
211,Hotel muy recomendable para visitar Dublin,"Hotel a unos 15 minutos andando de oconort street, el centro de dublin. Este presenta instalaciones bastante buenas con un gusto en su decoración. El personal es amable, y nosotros con encontramos a Sonia, una jefe de comedor española que fué su amabilidad y agrado junto con una implicación en ilustrarnos dublin y alrededores de lo mejor del hotel.
El desayuno es repetitivo pero a su vez variado y todo de buena calidad, los cafés son expresso o capuccino hechos de maquina, no los que ponen generalmente en los hoteles que son agua con café. Nos llevamos una grata impresión, despues de haber visto las criticas de este hotel que y de por sí eran buenas.",5,2011,11,07
211,Recomendable,"Agradable hotel, habitaciones amplias con una limpieza esmerada, el desayuno abundante y variado, el personal muy amable, todo ello te hace disfrutar de una estancia  agradable.",4,2011,11,04
211,Tolles Hotel,"Wir übernachteten 4 Tage im Croke Park Hotel. Die Zimmer sind modern eingerichtet und sehr sauber. Gebucht war ein Zimmer der gehobenen Kategorie inklusive Executive Bereich mit Frühstück. Ds Frühstück war ausgezeichnet. Sehr gute Auswahl an Obst/Cerealien etc. tagsüber konnte man sich mit Obst und Wasser für den Tag eindecken. Der Service am Empfang war sehr nett und herzlich. So wie man es von den Iren kennt. Ein guter Internetbereich war auch vorhanden. Die Bar war immer gut besucht und das Essen in der Bar war ausgezeichnet. Leider liess es das wetter nicht zu, im Aussenbereich der Bar zu sitzen, der sehr modern und gross gestaltet ist. Alles in allem wäre dies Hotel meine erste Wahl bei einem nächsten Besuch in Dublin.",5,2011,09,23
211,Muy buen hotel,"Llegamos al Croke Park un sábado por la tarde y nos dijerón que nos tenian que alojar en otro hotel porque al día siguiente había un partido importante en el estadio del mismo nombre que se encuentra enfrente.A partir de  este momento todo fue amabilidad y facilidades para que esto no nos ocasionara ningún trastorno.Nos llevaron en taxi hasta el centro de DUBLIN al hotel WESTBURY(por cierto una maravilla) que resulto ser de la misma cadena pero de mayor categoria y nos alojaron allí por dos noches porsupuesto sin cargo alguno y situado esquina con Grafton Street una de las calles mas animadas de DUBLIN.Despues nos volvieron a trasladar al Croke Park también en taxi  y todo resulto perfecto, son dos hoteles magnificos si vas a pasar unos  dias en Dublin  solo que el croke esta a 20 minutos del centro pero no dudeis en alojaros allí a nosotros nos trataron de maravilla.",4,2011,09,03
211,Ottimo hotel !,"Sono stato con mia moglie qui per tre notti, mentre giravamo l'Irlanda.
Ottimo servizio, ottime stanze (perfettamente insonorizzate), personale cortesissimo, breakfast eccellente e con ampia scelta, buona posizione in città (anche se la fermata dell'autobus più vicina è un po' lontana)... che volere di più ?
Rapporto qualità/prezzo ottimo. Assolutamente consigliato.",5,2011,08,25
211,Molto bello e pulito,"Abbiamo soggiornato in questo albergo per 3 notti con la famiglia e gli amici ed è stato tutto perfetto.

Non è centralissimo ma si raggiunge in 5 minuti di autobus il centro e la fermata è a 5/7 minuti a piedi dall'hotel. Inoltre davanti l'hotel c'è la fermata degli autobus hop on hop off!!",4,2011,07,18
211,sehr schönes Hotel,"Das Hotel liegt ein wenig auswärts, es ist daher sehr Ruhig zwischen Parkanlagen gelegen. Ich habe es über die Homepage des Hotels bestellt (super Preis bekommen mit Vorausbezahlung)  Zimmer sehr gross mit schönen Bad (einziges Manko wenig Licht im Bad) ansonste Tip Top nix zu sagen. Parkgarage kostenlos sowie ein Super Frühstück wenn man es nach 7 Uhr Morgens einnehmen kann (Abreisetag leider nur spärliche Breakfast Tasche)
Aber im ganz ein sehr tolles Haus mit sehr guten Service und sauberen Zimmern.",5,2011,07,04
211,Eine empfehlenswerte Alternative!,"Wenn man Dublin als Tourist erkunden möchte, liegt das Hotel gerade noch so weit innerhalb der Stadt, dass man zu Fuß noch bequem ins Zentrum kommen kann. Dennoch liegt das Croke Park Hotel nicht zentral, sondern direkt am größten Stadion des Landes.
Es war wirklich sehr preisgünstig, lieferte aber einen sehr guten Business-Standard mit allen nötigen Annehmlichkeiten wie Fitness, Businesscenter, freies W-LAN und Pay-TV. 
Die Zimmer waren groß, sauber und neu, das Frühstück vielfältig und lecker.",5,2011,03,12
211,"Buen Hotel, recomendable.","Un Hotel de 4 estrellas que bien podria ser de 5 estrellas.

No está en el centro, pero aun y así merece la pena hospedarse en él.",4,2010,10,14
211,Sehr komfortable Unterkunft. Top.,"Bin mit Freunden anlässlich eines Marillion Konzertes in Dublin gewesen. Das Hotel liegt gleich neben dem Crokepark Stadion und ist sehr komfortabel eingerichtet. Der Weg ins Zentrum ist nicht weit und auch zu Fuss zu bestreiten.  Die Zimmer sind geräumig und sehr gepfegt. Es gibt die Möglichkeit, sich warme Getränke (Tee/Kaffee) auf dem Zimmer zu zubereiten. Beim Frühstück kann man zwischen 2 Varianten wählen. Eine Kleine Variante oder halt inkl. warmer Speisen. Alles typisch Britisch mit grosser Auswahl. 
Das Personal ist sehr hifsbereit und am Wochenende gibt es günstige Tarife. Für einen Dublin-Trip nur zu empfehlen. Komme gerne wieder.",5,2010,09,24
211,Super Hotel in leider nicht so schöner Gegend,"Die letzte Nacht unserer Irland-Rundreise verbrachten wir im Croke Park Hotel in Dublin. Das Hotel ist wirklich toll! Die Zimmer sind sehr luxuriös und mit allem ausgestattet, was man sich wünschen kann. Das Bad stand dem in nichts nach. Es gab eine Badewanne und eine Dusche und alles war sehr sauber. Im Foyer gibt es zwei Computer mit Internetzugriff, außerdem einen Kraftraum. Das Personal war stets sehr freundlich. 
Beim üppigen Frühstücksbuffet war für jeden etwas dabei. Leider gab es unter den Servicekräften ein kleines Kommunikationsproblem, weil der Tisch, an dem wir saßen mit anderen Leuten besetzt wurde, während wir unser Essen geholt haben. Auch unser Late-Check-Out wurde nicht auf der Zimmerkarte vermerkt, so dass wir nach 12 Uhr erst mal nicht in unser Zimmer kamen und die Karte erst wieder freischalten lassen mussten. Wir hatten außerdem über HRS gebucht, wo diverse Gratisleistungen versprochen wurden. Leider wusste das Hotel davon nichts und bis heute habe ich von HRS zu meiner Rückfrage deswegen noch keine Antwort erhalten.
Insgesamt ist das Hotel wirklich empfehlenswert. Man kann auch zu Fuß in die Stadt laufen, wobei die Lage direkt am Stadion natürlich nicht ganz optimal ist. Vom St. Stephens Green sind wir abends mit dem Taxi zurückgefahren, was uns auch nur etwa 10 Euro gekostet hat.",4,2010,09,15
211,Sehr zu empfehlen,"Schönes, sehr sauberes Zimmer und großes Bad. Aufmerksames Personal.

Lage: gegenüber dem Croke Park Stadium.",5,2010,09,10
211,un muy buen hotel.,"El hotel es muy limpio, y las habitaciones con camas muy confortables y silencioso. Ademas el parking gratuito, hacen que la estancia en Dublin sea muy agradables.",4,2010,08,15
211,Sehr zu empfehlen - ideal für eine Städtereise,"Wir buchten dieses Hotel für eine 3-tägige Städtereise nach Dublin und wurden nicht enttäuscht. Die Lage ist ideal, man erreicht die Innenstadt  innerhalb von ca. 15 Minuten zu Fuß; auch der Flughafen ist mit dem Aircoach (Bus) schnell zu erreichen. Unser Zimmer war modern, sehr geräumig, sauber und mit allem Notwendigen ausgestattet. Vor allem das Bad war riesig und verfügte über eine große Dusche und eine separate Badewanne. Das Frühstücksbüfett war sehr umfangreich und bot für jeden Geschmack etwas. Auf Grund des ausgezeichneten Preis-/Leistungsverhältnisses würden wir dieses Hotel sofort wieder buchen.",5,2010,08,08
211,Gutes Hotel mit exzellentem P/L Verhältnis etwas ab vom Schuss,"Vorweg gesagt - Wer im Footballstadium direkt gegenüber dem Hotel zu tun hat - für den kann es wohl sowieso keine andere Wahl geben. Aber auch wer sich Dublin ansehen will trifft mit dem Croke Park Hotel eine gute Wahl.
Zum Stadtzentrum sind es 10-15 Minuten Fußweg durch Gegenden ,die vielleicht nicht als die schönsten Dublins bezeichnet werden können. Doch das wird mehr als wettgemacht durch das tolle Preis Leistungsverhältnis. Dublin ist ein sehr teures Pflaster geworden und  man muss länger suchen um einen guten Kompromiss aus Lage und Kosten zu finden. Das Croke Park hotel ist einer . Dublin ist nicht die größte stadt und alles liegt in Laufweite , oder, falls man sich das wirklich antun will, ist mit dem Bus zu erreichen. Das Bussystem Dublins ist eine Schande für die Stadt und ganz Irland, nicht einmal die Einheimischen verstehen welcher Bus wann wohin fährt, Informationen sind dünn gesät und für Touristen kann das ganze mal eben den Trip versauen. Wir sind nur einigermaßen richtig ausgestiegen ,vom Flughafen kommend, weil wir das Stadion in der Ferne erkannten und dann dorthin liefen. Ein Taxi ist die bessere Wahl,falls das Geld keine allzugroße Rolle spielt. 
Der Service war stets zuvorkommend, die  Zimmer mit sämtlichen Annehmlichkeiten ausgestattet und sehr sauber,bloß einen besonders tollen Ausblick sollte man sich halt nicht erwarten. Insgesamt eine gute Wahl für Dublin ohne wirkliche Minuspunkte.",4,2010,07,10
211,Sehr empfehlenswert,"Das Hotel liegt im weniger attraktiven Nordteil der Stadt, in dem der Zustand der Gebäude Geschichten erzählt über die offensichtliche Armut der Bevölkerung, die dort lebt. Darum ist es verwunderlich, ein so komfortables und empfehlenswertes 4*-Hotel dort vorzufinden. 
Service, Frühstück, Zimmer, Hygiene, Gesamteindruck: alles kann gelobt werden, es gab keine Beanstandungen. Fußläufig ist die City in ca. 15-20 Minuten zu erreichen, ebenso der Hauptbahnhof, von dem aus man gut mit dem Dart die Küste erreicht.
Nur der Blick auf die triste Kulisse drumherum trübte ein wenig den sonst sehr guten Eindruck.",5,2010,06,17
211,zentral und doch neu mit qualität,"die zentral lage erlaubt zu fuss zu bewegen ,trotzt stadium nah sehr ruhig aber ich finde dass in der stadtmitte neu angerichtet hotel zu diese kondizionen (4 nächte €.327,-) top ist

211,Un muy buen hotel,"Muy buen hotel, una atención excelente. Habitaciones muy cómodas. Un poco alejado del centro de la ciudad (una buena caminata)",5,2010,01,19
211,Ottima rapporto qualità/prezzo e se poi vi piace il calcio o il rugby...,"Veramente un bel hotel. E' adiacente allo stadio e ci vogliono 10 minuti di passeggiata per arrivare in centro. Vicina è anche la fermata dell'autobus, che deve fare solo poche fermate per arrivare in centro, in alternativa si può prendere un taxi con una spesa media di 10€ (di notte). Si raggiunge l'areoporto in 15 minuti di taxi con un costo medio di 25€.",4,2010,01,11
211,Muy buen hotel,"Esta situado justo enfrente del estadio Croke Park y a unos 15-20 minutos del Spire (O'Connell Street). El hotel esta muy nuevo, las habitaciones y el baño estan muy limpias. Tiene internet gratuito en las habitaciones. En el hotel hay bar(con pantalla gigante para ver deporte) y restaurante. Una muy buena eleccion, aunque no esta en el centro por calidad y precio, muy recomendable.",5,2009,12,22
211,Freundliches Hotel,"Wir konnten am Hotel (buchten ohne Frühstück) nichts aussetzen, das Personal war diskret im Hintergrund und sehr hilfsbereit.
Jederzeit wieder....",4,2009,11,20
211,excelente hotel en dublin,"He estado en Dublin en septiembre 2009 en el hotel Croke Park , situado justo al lado del estadio del mismo nombre. Leí unas críticas estupendas antes de ir y no puedo más que confirmarlas, porque si el hotel es de 4 estrellas de verdad, el personal es de 5, y no sólo unas paisanas españolas que encontramos, sino todos. Son profesionales y muy amables, haciéndote la estancia no sólo en el hotel, sino también en la ciudad muy fácil. Algunos viajeros decían que está lejos del centro, es verdad que no está en el mismo meollo, pero hay muchos autobuses que en diez minutos te dejan en O'connell Street; y nosotras bajamos andando un par de veces y es un agradable paseo de unos 15 ó 20 minutos. Cuando vas de viaje andar es una manera de conocer la ciudad.
Un consejo: si contratáis una excursión en autobús, que no sean los verdes con el dibujo del gnomo, porque no tuvimos buena experiencia. Si te retrasas son ""capaces"" de dejarte en tierra en cualquier sitio.",5,2009,09,19

Siamo arrivati a Dublino l'ultimo fine settimana di maggio, e grazie ad un'incredibile offerta di lastminute.com abbiamo soggiornato per 3 notti pagandone 2 (90 € + 90 €). Questo hotel ha 4 stelle e se le merita tutte! Il livello di accessori in dotazione alla camera è elevatissimo: TV LCD, wired & wireless internet access, hifi stereo, ferro e asse da stiro, asciugacapelli, carta da lettere con intestazione dell'hotel (adoro la carta da lettere degli hotel ^^ )... tutto il necessario per passare 2 giorni memorabili!
Il personale del bar è gentilissimo e ultra professionale, il ragazzo che fa il maitre di sala è un grande, e le cameriere sono simpaticissime - pensate che, quando hanno scoperto che era il mio compleanno, mi hanno portato una buonissima bayley's cheesecake con la candelina! :)
In definitiva, quando tornerò a Dublino, sicuramente prenoterò in questo splendido hotel! 10 +!!",5,2009,05,29
211,Perfetto eccetto la posizione,"Hotel molto bello, pulito, ampie camere; bagno con vasca e doccia. LETTO COMODISSIMO. Bollitore con te e biscotti gratuiti. Ferro da stiro in camera. Parcheggio  coperto gratuito. Bella palestra. Personale MOLTO gentile. Ampi ed eleganti spazi comuni (c'è persino una sala lettura) oltre ad un enorme bar. Ottima colazione e con ampia scelta anche di succhi di frutta freschi! ADSL GRATUITA. Unica pecca è l'ubicazione: si trova a ciirca 20 min a piedi dal centro: è a ridosso dello stadio Croke. Molto ben insonorizzato dall'esterno (la ferrovia nelle immediate vicinanze non si sente assolutamente!) Si sentono, invece, i rumori provenienti dalle camere adiacenti.
Complessivamente ci tornerei senza dubbio!",5,2009,05,29
211,Beste Lage,"Das Hotel ist sehr exclusiv ausgestattet und hat eine spitzen Lage in der Stadt. Zu fuss erreicht man den Bahnhof. Restaurants und Bars und auch Discos sid in direkter Umgebung. Die Zimmer sind wunderschön und das personal unglaublich freundlich.

211,"Hotel di lusso a prezzo incredibile, appena fuori dal centro","Sono stato a Dublino per 4 notte ad inizio maggio, ho scelto il Croke Park Hotel per le recensioni che aveva e per il prezzo ottimo. 
Raggiungerlo dall'aeroporto è davvero facile, si prende il 16A e dopo circa 30 minuti al prezzo di 1.80 € a testa (il biglietto si fa direttamente sul bus dicendo all'autista la stazione a cui si scenderà, ovvero Drumcundra Station). Si scende appunto a Drumcundra Station (appena superato un breve sottopassaggio), da lì a cinque minuti a piedi si raggiunge l'Hotel che si trova proprio di fronte allo stadio di Dublino (noi però non abbiamo notato alcun movimento nello stadio forse perchè non c'erano eventi o partite).
L'hotel è a circa 15-20 minuti dal centro a piedi, in una zona molto tranquilla e frequentata.
Il livello dell'hotel è davvero elevato, con ottimi servizi, pulizia perfetta.

Davvero consigliato.",5,2009,05,15
211,Hotel genial sobre todo si vas al rugby,"Estuve con mi mujer para ver el Irlanda-Inglaterra del 6 Naciones de Rugby. El hotel estaba dentro de la zona acordonada y el bar estaba a reventar. ¡Menudo ambiente! Super cómodo si vas a ver algo al estadio porque está en la otra acera de la calle.
El personal amable y servicial, las habitaciones espaciosas y limpias. Todo perfecto.
Andando está a unos 15-20 munutos del centro, pero es un paseo muy agradable y por una zona sin problemas. 
En resumen, un hotel genial para los amantes del rugby, pero tal vez para quien quiera visitar Dublín exclusivamente le recomendaría algún hotel en el centro.",4,2009,03,06
211,(Nahezu) Einwandfrei!,"Wir waren zum Dublin Marathon angereist und hatten aufgrund des relativ günstigen Preis das Jurys Croke ausgewählt.

Wenn man zum ersten Mal in Dublin ist, liegt das Hotel vielleicht etwas versteckt. Man sollte mit dem Bus bis zum Quinns Pub fahren und sich von dort zum Jurys Stadion durchfragen, dann vermeidet man unnötige Suche und Lauferei.
Für Fußfaule liegt das Hotel vielleicht etwas zu weit vom Zentrum entfernt, da Busse leider nicht bis direkt vor die Tür fahren und eine Taxifahrt vom Zentrum inklusive Stau locker 15 Euro kosten kann.

Zum Hotel ist nur folgendes zu sagen: Es entspricht voll 4-Sterne Standard, ist sehr sauber, hat viel Platz und ist ruhig gelegen. Absolut empfehlenswert und in dieser Kategorie zu diesem Preis unschlagbar für ein Haupstadthotel!
Trotz kleiner Pannen mit der Schlüsselkarte und einem ungeplanten Zimmerwechsel bleibt der sehr freundliche und symphatische Service in Erinnerung.
Die Bar ist super gemütlich und stilvoll, die Preise entsprechen den Preisen in den meisten Touristenpubs in der Stadt.
Frühstück sollte nach Möglichkeit mitgebucht werden und ist von einwandfreier Qualität. Zum Marathon wurde uns ohne Aufpreis ein Sportlerfrühstück schon vor der offiziellen Frühstückszeit auf das Zimmer gebracht. 
Die Zimmer sind geräumig, es gibt richtige Bettdecken, angenehme Matrazen und ein modernes Badezimmer mit Badewanne. Kleinere Mängel wie ein defektes Türschloss wurden schnell behoben. Das gute Betriebsklima im Hotel zeugt von einem guten Management.

Wenn ich nochmal nach Dublin komme, ist das Jurys Croke meine erste Adresse.",5,2008,10,30
211,molto bello,"Abbiamo soggiornato in questo hotel per 2 notti.Siamo stati molto contenti della pulizia e della gentilezza dello staff.
L`unico inconveniente è la lontananza dal centro,è necessario camminare per circa 15 minuti in una zona di periferia.",4,2008,09,11
211,"Nuevo, bien situado y bien atendido","Estuvimos 2 noches y nos encanto.
La habitación y el baño: nuevos y muy espaciosos.
Posibilidad de tomar -y pagar- solamente desayuno continental.
A 15 mns. del centro andando, parking gratuito.
Al encontrarse frente al estadio de rugby, puede que en días de partido, el hotel esté muy concurrido.",5,2008,07,30
211,un ottimo hotel a dublino,"Sono stato al Jurys Croke ad ottobre 2005. L'hotel è a diecei minuti a piedi dal centro, ottimo staff, camere pulite, bagni con il pavimento riscaldato, vasca e doccia. Colazione tipica irlandese o continentale  a buffet.
E' un hotel nuovo, moderno, con stile europeo e non tipicamente inglese, un servizio tipico da 4 stelle, molto professionale.
