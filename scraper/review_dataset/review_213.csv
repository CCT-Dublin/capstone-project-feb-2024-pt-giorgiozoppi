213,5 Stars Guest Service ***** WELL DONE FOR GREAT CUSTOMER SERVICE AGAIN!!!,"5 Stars Guest Service ***** WELL DONE FOR GREAT CUSTOMER SERVICE AGAIN!!!
I would like to give great commendations and also thank you to the Best and Wonderful Staff of Herbert Park Hotel in Ballsbridge Dublin. 
We dined in last May 2024 and just yesterday 27 September 2024 ( which was my actual birthday dinner ) as well!
We are regular diners in this Hotel and we are always served with the best customer service experience all the time!
Also, worth mentioning the beautiful upkeep of the hotel premises and the welcoming atmosphere once you entered the glass door. Feels like you are coming home to a very clean, neat, organised place where you can just sit on, relax and enjoy the cozy hotel lobby couches and enjoy the sumptuous food menu and drinks! 

The moment we entered the hotel lobby we were greeted with happy and yet very professional, pleasant and warm smiles of the Hotel Receptionists like Ronan and Monica ( it was back in May 2024...who are both handsome and beautiful I must say) who both made us all felt welcomed, advised and looked after, both when we arrived and before we left!

Then, when we found our table the very pleasant smiles of Karol Ionur and 
Cedric ( very tall and good looking guy ! ) assisted us, made us feel welcomed and offered us menus which we feel very good as we felt being served promptly but with care and attention. The table service was fast, efficient and the entire time we felt being looked after as both Karol and Cedric and all other Staff on duty ( couldn't get all their names to mention here ) were so accommodating and always checking up on us to make sure we have everything we need or want for our table without being pushy or annoying!

The food menu we ordered were super tasty ( we had seafood chowder, chicken wings, pasta, salmon and few desserts and coffee of course! I was craving for steak but not available on the night) so well done and high commendation to the Chef and Kitchen staffs on duty as well!

One small comment for improvement if the main glass entrance door could be closed or put some barriers as the draught was coming in and we can feel it in the lobby couches before we were shown our table! Just a small one but if can be improved, would be great please!

Finally, we did not get his name but the Duty Manager ( Bald guy but very pleasing smiles ooopss sorry to mention it), he also made us feel important as he was checking up on our table and even greeted me Happy Birthday last night 27.09.2024...he must have seen that I was given and blew my birthday candle!!!

Over-all, I can always say we are very happy going back again and again to Herbert Park Hotel and cannot wait till we visit again...hopefully not only for the food and drinks menu but also to be able to stay and enjoy the hotel guest room and facilities as well!

Thank you once again to all staff both back in May 2024 and last night 27.09.2024...KUDOS TO ALL STAFF..JOB WELL DONE ALL!!! KEEP UP THE GOOD WORK!!!

Regards,
FERDIE BILLOTE",5,2024,09,28
213,A Wonderful Stay,"We stayed in this hotel for four nights in September 2024, and completely enjoyed it.  We had a great room, and enjoyed both breakfast and dinner in the hotel.  The room was spacious and well cared for.  The location is great.  When they say the are at Herbert Park, they really mean it.  The dining room opens onto the park.  They are about one block from the US Embassy where one can find major bus lines.  It is also a short walk from a DART station.  

The staff was extremely helpful and friendly.  The people at the reception desk were a great resource when we needed something.

If you are there on a Sunday morning, walk out into the park and enjoy the market full of local merchants for everything from baked goods to chocolates to souvenirs.  ",5,2024,09,28
213,Great room!,"Great room, and very friendly staff! Our waiter at lunch, Bedirhan, was awesome! We were here on a tour, so our bus driver had quite a time getting into the parking lot. The breakfast was probably the best we had in a week. The Caesar Salad we had for lunch was VERY good!",5,2024,09,27

213,Good and bad,"This hotel uses the word luxury in its description. Our room was an executive room, but it was not luxurious. The carpet was worn, condensation had formed between the panes of the double glazing of the windows, meaning that the view from our room was obscured, furniture appeared worn and bare wiring was visible in the bathroom.
However, the saving grace of this hotel was its staff. Everyone was friendly and professional. A typical example was Julio H who served in the restaurant at breakfast. Also, the appearance of the reception area, the lobby area and the restaurant was very good.
So to summise, good appearance on the ground floor, good staff, but poor rooms.",2,2024,09,23

The Herbert Park is my go-to hotel in this part of town.  After a few visits everyone recognises me and greets me like a friend. 

The menu has something for everyone and the bar is a lovely calm space with a good selection and serene and effective service.  

Stand out service this visit came from Gokhan whose attitude “everything is possible” beautifully summarises the ethos of this lovely hotel.

I’ll be back!",5,2024,09,22

The accommodations are nice, good hotel restaurants and the staff were very nice and helpful. There isn't much around the hotel if you are a tourist. We used it as a base and taxied into the Temple Bar and central Dublin for our tours and sight seeing. Very nice neighborhood if you don't mind being just a block or two away from the US Embassy. Both the hotel bar and dinning restaurants were good, better than some of the near by places to eat. Had a problem on our last night with loud guests in the hallway while we were trying to sleep.",4,2024,08,20

213,Looking forward to re-visiting,"The hotel is lovely, very clean and the reception staff are so helpful and kind. Rooms are very comfortable and breakfast was excellent. The evening lounge was understaffed on 18.08.24 and we waited over an hour to get a menu or a drink or even a staff member to get the chance to acknowledge us. We had to leave without the option of ordering food and ended up with more efficient room service. The following day made up for the experience so it was possibly just an understaffing issue.",4,2024,08,19

213,Right hotel for first visit to Dublin.,A excellent hotel in a great location with good quality restaurants nearby.

213,TS Stay!!!,Stayed at The Herbert Park hotel while attending Taylor Swift concert.  10 minutes walk to Aviva Stadium. Fabulous hotel with beautiful adjoining park.  Outstanding room service and breakfast. Amazing pleasant and helpful staff. Hope to return soon 😊,5,2024,08,16

Will be back.",5,2024,08,16
213,A pleasant stay walking distance to Dublin Centre,"This is a great hotel and has always provided great quality. We got a fantastic deal for an executive room and breakfast to the room which was a really lovely breakfast. 

I’d recommend the executive rooms or rooms on the 5th floor as they’re very quiet and have decent AC. 

I do think the rooms need modernising. The bathrooms in particular are looking a bit dated and dark, and the showers/baths aren’t particularly impressive but overall a very pleasant stay and only a 30 min walk into temple bar through the Georgian streets of south Dublin. 

Ballsbridge has incredible eateries and bars too so only a stones throw away from a meal out if you wanted too. 

There’s a market on in the Herbert park itself next door to the hotel every Sunday, a really lovely vibe worth checking out",4,2024,08,16
213,Tiny room in need of updating.  Good location,"The room is very very small and should not be describe as a studio.  It is a bedroom with the corner taken out as a bathroom  and a sink in another corner.  The complementary coffee and jams etc were good and an a pleasant surprise.  The carpet was dirty and commented on in previous reviews.  The general room and hallway would benefit from updating  - it looks very tired.  Despite the great location and very nice staff,  I am unlikely to stay again.  We stayed for 4 nights and that was too long for such a tiny, not very pleasant space.",3,2024,08,16
213,Herbert park hotel,"Great place altogether. I want to thank Julio Henrique in particular, good attention and kind approach made all the difference. 
Would definitely stay here again for the Dublin horse show, good atmosphere around the place. Champagne on arrival was a lovely touch.",5,2024,08,16
213,Hotel alongside RDS,"Located in Ballsbridge dublin alongside the RDS the Herbert park is a modern hotel.  Check in was pleasant and efficient. Rooms are comfortable and good facilities. The shower / bathroom was a tad disappointing with toiletries being sparse and dated.   Bath tired and dated too.   Not the cheapest type of accommodation so one would expect a better quality.  
Bar food was ok but would not call it wow for the prices along ok service.  WiFi quite good and parking underground available but limited.",3,2024,08,15

213,Excellent stay.,"Excellent hotel and staff in great location on the edge of Herbert Park.
Room comfortable with good bed. Breakfast was excellent - great variety and very good quality of all items - lots of everything too!
Julio was very helpful as we had two small grandchildren and two children plus their partners with us as well.
Recommended and will definitely use them again.",5,2024,08,15
213,Nice room - but some vital things missing (no wardrobe or hanging rail!),"We stayed at the hotel for two nights as we were attending a nearby family wedding.  We were 'upgraded' to an Executive King room. The first thing that was obvious was there was no wardrobe!  Very strange.  In all my experience and years of staying in hotels, I have never stayed in a hotel room that didn't have a wardrobe or at least a hanging rail.  The 'wardrobe' was in fact just a coat stand!  Not ideal for our wedding attire.  The second thing I noticed was there was no long mirror.  I like a long mirror, especially when I'm getting dressed up for a wedding.  The third thing was there was no mirror near electrical sockets to dry and style my hair.  I ended up unplugging the coffee machine that had a mirror with shelves behind it, moving all the cups, saucers, glasses etc off the shelves so that I could vaguely see myself in the mirror and using the socket intended for the coffee machine.  The fourth thing that wasn't ideal was the safe was at floor level.  Very tricky using it at such a low level.  
The bathroom had the most fabulous enormous shower cubicle where I presume the bath once was, as the shower head looked like it was the same type you would expect to see over a bath and hadn't been upgraded and therefore the shower itself was just ok. Unfortunately though, on our last morning, there was no hot water to the shower, it was just cool.  On the plus side, the bed was large and very comfortable and the room was air conditioned.  The baked salmon in the restaurant was also very good and a good range of food for breakfast  If I stayed here again, I definitely wouldn't want to stay in that room (Room 314).",4,2024,08,14
213,a perfect weekend in Dublin,"It was a perfect weekend in a lovely en lively city.. Herbert Park Hotel is one of the best properties to stay in.

Plenty of space, kitchen had everything you would need, lovely sitting room area, beautiful bathroom and the bed... WOW! so comfortable. Apartment was spotless. It was nice and quiet (im a very light sleeper so that was amazing for me). The rest of the hotel is just beautiful. Great central location. Bar/lobby area is beautiful. Serena was on duty again when I was checking out and again, she was so so lovely. I told her that I would 110% be back, but that my expectations were now so high with the apartment, that I would need that every time i stayed :) She was such a breath of fresh air and a credit to your hotel/front of house team.

213,Excellent hotel in desirable location,"Located next to Herbert Park in Ballsbridge, this is the ideal location for your stay in the city.  Whether walking, driving, or taking public transport, you have the city center within easy reach.
The hotel breakfast buffet will give you a great start to the day. There is a wide range of offerings, from juices and cereals to eggs, rashers, sausages, tomatoes, mushrooms and more; accompanied by you own pot of coffee or tea. The rooms are spacious with large beds, coffee machines and a small fridge.  The fridge is too small to hold much other than the overpriced beverages offered. The bathroom and shower are great, There is a full small gym in the basement, open 24/7- a must have for fitness folk like myself. I had it to myself the times i went there. The staff are helpful and friendly, and go above and beyond to make your stay enjoyable. ",5,2024,08,06

Rooms are great, clean and super comfortable.
Staff are not only friendly, but can't do enough to help. For example, we stay in July and got our times wrong for breakfast, other hotels that would be it, but the staff organise a table in the bar area, asked what we wanted and served us.
Why wouldn't you not come back.",5,2024,08,06

213,FD Staff Training/Great Food,"The front desk was a mess each time I interacted with them. Check in was long and unnecessary for a group booking. A better flow/process needs to be established for group check ins, we had no issues at the other 6 hotels we stayed in during our tour of Ireland. A poor start to our two night stay. The overnight agent, Josan, during the last night of our stay was rude and not helpful at all. I had to argue with him in order to get any type of help at all. The bathroom shower leaked all over the floor, it would run down the glass wall, onto the ledge then onto the floor. The pitch of the ledge was pitched incorrectly causing all of the water to leak onto the floor no matter what. The room and bed were small but the room was well stocked with in room amenities. The food at breakfast was very good, many selections and very fresh. It was great that the lobby bar was open so late, 2am for us. The bar, breakfast, and housekeeping staff were great! Friendly and attentive.",3,2024,08,01
213,Fantastic Hotel in the perfect location!,"Couldn’t fault anything with our stay and just wished we could have stayed longer! We arrived early and our room was available straight away! The check in was seamless and the staff were amazing! Added bonus was that we got parking straight outside the door! The room was fantastic, great size and had everything we needed. The room aspect was looking out towards the Aviva Stadium and though the room was close to the Pembroke/Merrion Road you couldn’t hear any traffic noise which is just what you want from a Hotel in a city and didnt hear any noise from the hallway either! Had a great night sleep with the bed being so comfortable! The bar food was great with a great menu selection .Highly recommend the beef burger and the salmon! Plenty of Staff in the bar and in the dining room so you weren’t left waiting to be served! Great options for breakfast too to suit suit someone who wants a full Irish or a continental! Location is just brilliant with the gorgeous Herbert Park right on your doorstep! The Hotel has easy access to public transport right into the city centre! After a recent stay in a 5* hotel it wasn’t a patch on the Herbert Park Hotel & Place Residence experience! This hotel’s customer service level is exceptional and every staff member we met were amazing! So thank you for a memorable stay! We will definitely will be back!",5,2024,08,01

The staff (shout out to Monica) were friendly and efficient in check in and check out, and can give you some advice with your explorations. They seem to have a nice restaurant but I wasn’t able to take advantage of it. 
It is a bit farther from the more touristy areas - which may be a good or a bad thing depending on how you look at it.",5,2024,07,26

213,Unexpected Night,Hi we stayed there on 6/30 to 7/1.  We were suppose to head home on 7/1 to America.  Our plane was cancelled unexpectedly.  The hotel staff especially Elena and Serena were fantastic.  Elena helped us on 7/1 -calling the airlines to find out about our flight.  She also consoled me with water and tissues when we were having trouble flying out to Philadelphia the next day.  We actually had to fly to Boston then connecting flight to Washington and rent a car to get home to Philadelphia.  She was able to schedule an extra night at the hotel on 7/2.  She was very sweet and caring.  The next day Serena helped us with transportation to the airport.  We felt fortunate to be “stuck” in your hotel. -Herbert Park Hotel.  Thank you!,5,2024,07,17

213,Great location. Thin walls.,"The location is perfect for Aviva, RDS, shopping in dundrum or seeing a show in the Bord Gais Theatre. Staff were very kind and helpful and the rooms were spacious if not a little technologically dated. However our relaxing night away was ruined totally by the lack of sleep we received as there was a school group on our floor. They were awake from 5am until 9.30am, when I assume they left for breakfast. I rang the desk twice to complain and it would stop for 15/20 minutes and would then start up again. Slamming doors, screaming at each other from the rooms and running up and down the halls. I understand this isn’t the staffs fault but as someone paying a considerable amount of money to spend the night and relax this completely ruined our night. We were exhausted checking out and the hotel covered our parking. I feel like that was the least they could have done and I was expecting more to be honest.",3,2024,07,14

213,"No privacy, room faces into offices","Stayed in a courtyard studio for 3 nights and nowhere did I see in advance that these rooms do not have any privacy unless you keep the blinds and curtains closed i.e. have no natural light in the room. Room looked directly into offices and then corner view was into other studios. The offices had frosting on their windows so I couldn't see them fully but no such consideration for the guests. Noise from a fan or other type of motor loud during the night and impacted sleep.
Studio itself had everything needed for my stay and was nice but I would not stay in the hotel again if it meant a studio apartment and not sure I would recommend for the hotel aspect as I felt the hotel had a cold atmosphere, not helped by long lounge layout. Only good thing about the stay was location, lovely to be able to go for walks in area, close to buses and good coffee shop (Mister Magpie)",2,2024,04,25

The food in the Terrace Lounge was delicious, and I cannot say enough good things about the staff, in particular Marijan at the front desk, who deserves a shout-out for all of his help. We love the hotel so much that we consider it our ""home away from home"" on our frequent trips to Dublin.",5,2024,04,21

213,"Room given away, but compensated.","Rooms are pleasant and spacious.
Staff is friendly. Planning didn't seem to be their strongpoint at our stay, although they solved it.
When we arrived, my colleague did arrive a day late for his reservation, but even though paying over 1k euro, his room had already been given away for the whole week while only being a day late (no calls where made to check his late arrival). He was compensated (with a room upgrade), but we still had to wait for an hour around midnight to have things arranged, while being tired of flying.
Last morning at breafast our room numbers were not on the list. A bit silly, but quickly solved.
In general an OK experience, but management should probably be more careful, as double booking is an ill practice, risking many upset curstomers.",4,2024,04,19
213,Worth it,"Very helpful staff… Monica at the desk was superb. Brilliant breakfast. The entire staff at the bar was nice, diligent and polite. Defo will come back.",5,2024,04,19

The salom too was amazing. As matter of fact, dishes were all amazing. Thanks",5,2024,04,14
213,Perfect place if it's where you want to be,"Our tour group put us up in this hotel, and it was very nice.  The staff was very nice and attentive to any questions or needs.  The restaurant was a bit expensive for my budget, but the tour covered that . The only negative for me is that it isn't anywhere close to the ""touristy"" things you may want to do, so be aware you need the ability to arrange transportation or have good walking shoes.  It can be walked, but it's about a mile+ each way just to reach, say Trinity College.",5,2024,04,14
213,Dublin gem,"Great location and hassle free parking. Accommodating staff as needed an early check in for a wedding. Spotless clean room with lovely view. Beautiful breakfast and worth having.

213,Great hotel . Great staff,"As a regular visitor to this hidden gem of a Dublin hotel I was once again extremely impressed with everything about the hotel . All  staff at reception treat guests with great friendliness and professional and on this occasion I was welcomed by Nives who was superb as are all her colleagues. The room was beautiful and I was on this occasion lucky to have a room overlooking Herbert Park . The room service is also exceptionally good and so few hotels match their service . The area is very peaceful and  a walk from the city centre . There are also great restaurants nearby such as Saba , Avoca , Sprout . My only reluctance in recommending this special hotel is that it will be booked out for my next visit . Alan Gray Waterford",5,2024,04,13
213,Superb Staff and Good Location,"This unsolicited review is long overdue, but memories of my lengthy stay in the Herbert Park Hotel will never be forgotten, mostly because of the staff and friendships made during my sixteen month stay.   Having lived in Vancouver, Canada for many years, I was somewhat spoilt, so returning to my homeland during an unprecendeted housing shortage was challenging.  Thanks to the caring staff at this lovely hotel, I've survived.

Life experiences have taught me that wherever there are good staff, there is usually a capable, well-trained manager at the helm, who is unafraid to delegate.  In the case of the Herbert Park Hotel, I believe Kevin, the Head Chef and Siva, the Restaurant Manager, play a significant role in the Hotel's success. Having lived in the Hotel for longer than most, I think the hotel's reputation and repeat business is as a result of the Head Chef's high standard as well as the Restaurant Manager's ability to remain cool, calm and collected at all times.  Kevin and Siva are both gentle men, in every sense of the word, and do the hotel proud.  They care about staff and guests and nothing is too much trouble.  As I was well treated by many employees, I feel it important to mention those, who are not in the spotlight. Those who come to mind as I write are: Kevin, Siva, Alfredo, Kamal, Stephani, Kiran, Paritosh, Dan, Pur, Jilson, Franki, Ivan, Joe, Evelyn, Marilis, Elias, Roberto, Italia, Maria 'Sol', Maria, Abai, Julio, Jacqueline, Carlos, Delia, Gorken, Arun, Marcella, Bedo, Alejo, Sol Bakken, Onur and Emmanuel.   
I feel it important to also single out Bianca, the Manager of Housekeeping and Maintenance.  Bianca leads by example and wears many hats, always with a smile.  Despite her many responsibilities, she is never too busy to stop and greet longtime hotel patrons.  This makes a difference as many regular guests dine alone and appreciate such kind gestures that are rare in today's busy world.  Joe is another jewel in the crown and is, also, well liked and highly respected by regular guests, who frequent the lounge.   I would also like to mention the housekeeping staff, who serviced my room and were exceptionally thoughtful and kind in my time of need.  As well as Bianca, I would like to thank Ildiko, Danielle, Rosie, Abel-lozano, Timi, Ljiljana, Szilvia, Andrea and others, who brightened my day and made sure I wanted for nothing.  It would be remiss of me not to give Anton a special mention as he is another Jewel in the Hotel's Crown.  Anton has a magic touch and whenever he is away everyone notices.
In a previous review, posted in November, 2022, I highlighted the Hotel's idyllic location and mentioned other Hotel personnel.  This time I feel it important to mention to the unsung heroes, who did the little things that made a big difference.    Special thanks also to the Reception Staff, including Rupa, Andor, Marijan, Bernie, Monica, Viktor and the middle-management Team, including Josan, Sarah, Jenny, and Kamilla.  You all made a difference and I will remain forever grateful for the kindness you extended to me and those who visited me at the Herbert Park Hotel during a difficult chapter in my life.",4,2024,04,12
213,"Location, staff and ambience","A stylish and luxury hotel, which combines contemporary design with timeless elegance. We booked a special package where the possibility of a room upgrade was possible (depending on availability). We did well, as we were upgraded to a studio apartment with balcony, which overlooked the adjacent Herbert Park. This was a significant upgrade, and we were delighted to get this beautiful and well-equipped studio apartment! We found the staff to be exceptionally friendly and helpful, and wish to name Monica on Reception and Julio (a server at breakfast) as particularly pleasant and helpful. Apart from the excellent hotel itself, you cannot beat the location. It is a short taxi ride into the city centre, or a 20 minute walk, it's also just a 5 minute walk to Lansdowne Road Dart (light rail) station which can take you into the city centre, or south along the coast. Not a cheap hotel, but regularly has offers which if be availed upon, make it great value. The breakfast was super, and well worth having.",5,2024,04,12

To mention a few names that I can remember, I'll start with Wicktor at the front desk; he made it easy to check in from our flight. On another day we had some questions about a tour and Ronan at the front desk made the whole process simple; and, the tour exceeded expectations.  Handling the dining room an extremely knowledgeable in Herbert Park Hotel operations was a lady named Sara. Sara made sure that everything was perfect and ensured that the staff were extremely customer oriented! Separate from the dining room was a restaurant. In the restaurant Joe and Gokhan made sure the customers were well taken care of! One last thing I should mention is that the chef in the restaurant area was also superb.

The staff is extremely professional and eager to help guest in any way.  I highly recommend this hotel but...  
There often a but...
The kitchen requires a new chef.  While restaurant service was also tops, the same cannot be said for what is presented at the table.  One should not go to the Herbert Park for the food.   Dinner was microwaved commercial food.  Breakfast was okay if one sticks to the buffet but once again, I receive an over-cooked/burnt  omelet at an Irish hotel.  I had just returned from a Moroccan hotel which served perfect French omelets five days in a row,  It ain't that hard.  The brown bread was from yesterday; the black and brown pudding was dried out.  Yikes.  My spouse tells me the yogurt was very good.  
The night before is the first awful pint of Guinness I received after living eight months in Ireland.  Not only poured incorrectly but the keg was not fresh (and/or the seldom used lines were contaminated.) Shame on the bar manager!!
Enjoy the wonderful Herbert Park but avoid the kitchen and bar.",4,2024,02,23
213,"A gem! Great staff, gorgeous views, short walk into town!","Great staff, fantastic location, brownies to die for!

I stayed here for 3 nights while celebrating my birthday in Dublin. I
selected the hotel due to its proximity to town, without the noise of
being in the city center. The hotel is centrally located and overlooks
Herbert Park. Roly's restaurant and Dublin's 2 euro americano are just
around the corner.

The great: Rolys may have a 2 euro americano, but the Herbert Park
has the most delicious brownie bite you will ever taste served with
every americano!

Every room has a Nespresso machine.

The staff - everyone is amazing!

The bad, then good: The second night of my stay there was an
unfortunate incident, the people in the room next door had a very loud
all night party. Hotel staff came up multiple times to ask them to turn
down the music, without success. Upon learning that they had
extended their stay and weren't checking out I requested a different
room.
I was moved to a lovely quiet room overlooking the park on the 4th
floor. The bed was a lot more comfortable and the view was stunning.

I would stay here again, and will be back next weekend! It's a lovely
well run hotel in a great location - did I mention the delicious brownie
bites? They are among the best brownies I have ever tasted anywhere!",5,2024,02,23

213,Lovely Stay,"We booked the Sparkle and Save package and were delighted with our night away.  The hotel is elegantly  furnished and warm and inviting.  The lobby is lovely to enjoy a snack or drink in and the restaurant is airy with a very good menu.... We really enjoyed our dinner and breakfast and were delighted to see so many wait staff on, each of them so helpful and cheerful.  We were checked in and out by lovely Monica who surprised us with an upgraded room.  Monica gave a warm cheerful welcome which was very efficient.  Our room was lovely with a gorgeous view out over one of my favourite Dublin Parks - Herbert Park.  The room was beautifully furnished with lots of details often overlooked provided e.g.  An adapter for toothbrush chargers and USB wires.  The bathroom was fabulous with a huge shower stall and elegant tiling.  The only negative in the bathroom was the lack of a shelf to put your own items on.... There were pegs for same under the sink but one hadn't been placed in our room.  The room is air conditioned and has a nice bar area with mini bar and good coffee machine.  Breakfast next morning was excellent one of the best we've had with lots of choice and again lots of cheerful staff on... I was raging I was rushing off as I would have lingered over that breakfast!

213,Great service in The Herbert Park,"Love staying at The Herbert Park Hotel. On my last visit, Dec 6th/7th 2023, I have to call out Cedric in the bar, who was extremely polite and attentive- a real example of how good service staff can be and he’s a real asset to the team there. 

The one comment I’d have, where improvement is needed at the hotel (and this is following a number of visits there) is the breakfast - the quality of the hot buffet items is very poor for such an hotel (and having once paying for it separately, as I didn’t include breakfast in my booking , it was very expensive and the value for money was not there - I wish they would re-look at the entire breakfast experience)",4,2024,01,24
213,Local favourite for Sunday evening snack,"We live locally and had a bite and a drink in the spacious but comfortable lobby on Sunday evening.  Very tasty vegetable soup and a nice pint.

213,"A really comfortable, affordable hotel in a quiet part of Dublin","I have stayed in this hotel a few times when on business in Dublin.  It is about 4-5km outside the CBD in a quiet suburb, next to a large park (about €12-18 by Uber into the CBD if you don't want to drive).  Herbert Park Hotel is a large business hotel, with good facilities .  It has underground car parking (€12/night), fabulous breakfasts, and large bedrooms.  The rooms are well equipped, with the usual amenities except (oddly) no iron and ironing board.  Housekeeping delivered both within a couple of minutes on request.  Room service offers a good selection and was very prompt, albeit at a slightly hefty €6.50 tray delivery charge.  The staff are multinational and very friendly.  At €154 a night with breakfast, it is a bargain!",4,2024,01,15

213,Good value is going to event at RDS,"We decided to get breakfast to the room the morning after, early before we took off. Nearly 55€!! Absolutely shocking…. Charged for two full breakfasts when my boyfriend only got sausages and a hash brown. Couldn’t believe when the man told us. And upon arrival the car park was full? Seen a big section just blocked off? Why…but a lovely girl receptionist said there was a space for us at the front and the male receptionist was rude when my boyfriend was hesitant about his car and the poles to which the male staff said he much not be experienced at driving??

The first night I stayed in room 517 and the second night I was in room 509. 509 was way better and the view from the balcony was beautiful. The staff were amazing, extremely professional and efficient especially Rupa, Vanessa and this other man named Viktor. They took great care of me and thanks to them this hotel now has a loyal customer and I’ve recommended this hotel to a lot of my friends and colleagues. I’ll be staying there regularly and I hope to be getting rooms on the 5th floor. Anyone who has anything bad to say about this hotel or the stuff would surely be out of their minds. Rupa & Vanessa made my stay delightful, they basically treated me with the highest respect and I felt at home.",5,2023,12,28
213,A Mixed Experience at Herbert Park Hotel,"As a frequent traveler due to my profession, which demands global travel, I've stayed in various hotels across almost every European country. Typically, I refrain from leaving reviews on my hotel experiences, but my recent stay at the Herbert Park Hotel with my partner has compelled me to share my thoughts on TripAdvisor.

The reception staff, notably Rupa, stood out for their friendliness and efficiency. However, after the first week, we observed that many of them seemed overworked, with shifts lasting at least 12 hours. It became apparent that they were under the watchful eye of the hotel director, Egle. While she exuded an air of arrogance behind the front desk, she transformed into a pleasant figure when faced with a customer complaint, seemingly willing to go to great lengths to avoid negative TripAdvisor reviews.

While it's understandable that the hotel strives to compete for top positions on TripAdvisor (as Egle personally emphasized during our check-out), witnessing the working conditions of some staff left us disconcerted. The pursuit of excellence should not come at the expense of employee well-being.

In summary, the hotel itself was commendable, the location excellent, and the staff professional. However, it's crucial to remember that if the staff doesn't get adequate rest, the quality of service may suffer. Perhaps exploring alternatives, such as implementing robotic receptionists that do not require rest, could be considered.

Sincerely,
Tom Murphy",1,2023,12,25
213,4 nights at the Herbert park hotel,"Stayed 4 nights in the Courtyard Apartments and they were fantastic. The kitchenette has everything you need really. Only downside is that you only get the room cleaned upon request. But if you need things like towels and toilet paper you just call reception. The washing machine/dryer came in handy. The view isn’t amazing but it’s alright. Bed was super comfortable and the room is amazing. Oh and the toilet has floor heating which is so nice in winter.

213,The Residence Gem,"We have been going to Herbert Park Hotel for so many years now that it must be in our DNA!! However we always like to give feedback sometimes critical but also praise when it is due. Since Egle took over as head of management there has been a noticeable improvement at all levels in the hotel. The staff have a genuine manner that is warm, homely and professional. The lounge is a super meeting place and we thought that the breakfast had actually improved! But the best part on this visit is that we stayed in The Residence. OMG ! This is as good as any 5 star and is a fully fitted studio facing Herbert Park. And I mean fully fitted! It is perfect for a short stay or for work if you want to do some self catering. The Residence is a real GEM and something that must go on your bucket list.",5,2023,11,16

213,A Gem!,"We stayed in the one of the Park View Studio Apartments in the Park Residence. It really was quite amazing, the comfort, the quality of finish and the facilities in the apartment were probably better than any 5 star we’ve experienced. If you enjoy a top quality place to stay for work or to relax this studio will amaze with kitchen hob, micro wave, dish washer and I think there was a washing machine!! Fridge of course.

Had a late dinner in the very comfortable bar area which was reasonably priced and delicious. I’ll be back. Very happy business traveller.",5,2023,11,09
213,Fabulous breakfast and excellent service,"Love staying here whenever I come to Dublin! The location is fabulous - in a leafy suburb a leisurely walk into the main hustle and bustle, flanked by gorgeous houses or a quick bus should you desire. 

Room are spacious and clean, perfect to relax. Breakfast is the absolute highlight of our stay though, more than enough to do you well past lunch with lots of cooked option, scrambled eggs, granola bar, fresh fruit and yoghurts. The reason we visit is because my mother remembers how good it the breakfast from a visit while she was pregnant with me and we’re both now hooked!

On my latest booking, I booked thorugh an online travel agency which I discovered had negative reviews after the fact. I then checked with Herbert Park had they received my booking thorugh this agency, which they hadn’t. This is in line with the negative reviews of the travel agency and no fault of the Herbert Park. 

Fortunately the staff at the Herbert Park were able to find me a room at my desired dates which an even better rate than the external booking site. The staff member I dealt with was Filip, who dealt with my concerns promptly and professionally, really alleviating my panic and making me look forward to my stay even more. The staff at the Herbert have consistently been fantastic but I do want to thank him especially.",5,2023,11,07

213,Comfortable stay.,"Very nice and clean hotel. Comfortable bed. Staff are lovely and accomodating.  Price is reasonable. Cost us 40 euros taxi return from 3arena. Drinks a bit pricey,but thats Dublin in general anyway. Didnt get a chance to have breakfast because we were in a rush. Overall it was a great stay. Checked already how much for an overnight stay again for next year's Taylor Swift concert, but it's expensive,but if coming back again next time when visiting Dublin, will defo come back again.

213,the TA reviews prove spot-on once again,"Picked this hotel for my first visit to Dublin (4 nights) based solely on the TA reviews, which are almost always spot-on in my experience.  Herbert Park Hotel is well located on the ""embassy roads"" overlooking a big beautiful park mostly away from all the drunken ballers and boozers and when I was there marathon-running crowds (all polite but loud) but thanks to the Sandymount DART station just a few blocks away from any action a sophisticate younger than me might want a good location even for any partiers.  Beatty Museum visit was wonderful, as was day trip to Howth, recommended by wonderful hotel staff across the board, of which there are many many.  My room wasn't ready when I arrived from the US before six in the morning, but the staff quickly put me in another room with intentions to move me the following morning....at which time just from curiosity I asked to see where they were planning on moving me but also one of their ""residences""  (small apartments with WDs and kitchens and patios) and upon praising it was complimentarily moved to it!!   Have I mentioned how wonderful all the staff are?  oh, and the food in the Terrace Bar is quite good. ",5,2023,10,31
213,Amazing Stay ,Fantastic experience as usual. Room very comfortable. Bed very comfortable. Reception very helpful and friendly. The hotel is always very welcoming and the staff always want to please you. Breakfast fantastic too.,5,2023,10,30

213,A great experience!,"Upon arrival the friendliest of staff greet you and check in is simple. The rooms are clean, spacious and very comfortable especially the king size beds... The buffet breakfast is one of the best I have ever seen. There is also a tasty menu for some evening dining in the Terrace Lounge. I cannot highlight the efficiency and kindness of the staff enough, they are a credit to this hotel. I have stayed here on more than one occasion and will be staying again. I highly recommend staying here. ",5,2023,10,27
213,Poor service ,Unbelievably bad service - exit gate would not accept our ticket (due to staff error) and staff could not come out to raise barrier but when I went back in to hotel 5 staff Behind desk looking bored- some staff mumbling behind masks - very very lazy vibe - no tea making facilities in room even though tea bags on tray - very limited toiletries in room 1 sachet of shampoo and body wash - nothing else - soulless- 3 star at best but service and staff attitude 1 star ,1,2023,10,26
213,Never again ,"Very busy reception on arrival. Greeted by a robotic receptionist. Cold and perfunctory.  €50 put on my card with no explanation until I asked. It’s for incidentals I was told. 
I had been travelling and wanted to rest in the afternoon. Major work going on. Drilling felt like it was in the room next door. Rang reception was told it was work to ensure health and safety of the staff. Couldn’t sleep. 
Was charged another €50 on my card unnecessarily and was refunded when I noticed.  Not good enough. 
Rooms are outdated. One plug to charge devices which was behind the tv. Felt like my granny’s house in the 70’s. 
€200 for this experience. I did not enjoy this hotel at all. 
",1,2023,10,26
213,"Great staff, location and food","The check-in in this hotel was very efficient with friendly courteous staff and this was a theme with all the staff we encountered. The room was bright, spotlessly clean with good toiletries in the bathroom. Like all hotels it did have a needlessly complicated heating/ air conditioning control panel as well as light switches that seem to put on every light except the one you wanted. The bed was very comfortable. We had planned to eat in the terrace lounge but despite hard working and busy staff it seemed slow. The food in the dining room was excellent as was the service. Herbert Park is in great location with good parking. We will be back",5,2023,10,25
213,Comfortable stay with excellent breakfast,Delighted with our accommodation.  Everything needed was close at hand and the breakfast buffet was the best we've had.

213,Loves little house #9,We had a fabulous experience during our stay at the Herbert Park Hotel in October!  We got really lucky and stayed in house #9 which was so fortunate. We stayed in a two story house with 3 bedrooms and 2 full baths with a powder room downstairs. A full kitchen and a little courtyard!  So fun and we still had all the services of being at the full service hotel. ,5,2023,10,24

213,Wouldn’t recommend this place,Loud noises like construction could be heard in our room. The mattress was hard and springy. The towels had some stains when we arrived. They were also crunchy along with the robes. So not plush at all. People that worked there were great. Parking garage below was great. Close to the bus stops but far from the main Dublin areas for tourists. We were supposed to have a garden view and we saw a building and like a tree….. I just wouldn’t recommend this place to anyone,2,2023,10,23
213,Executive Room,"Very nice room, fair price,clean, good view, I like that you can order food untill 22:00. it would be better to include pictures in the menu but overall good. The bed was big and firm.

Maybe if the TV would have been smart TV and bigger.",5,2023,10,23

213,Lovely rooms and location. Slightly disappointed with staff interactions.,"Lovely rooms and location. Slightly disappointed with staff interactions. Lack of knowledge about celiac in restaurant and found it quite annoying to be asked for a deposit on a room paid for in advance which was already quite expensive.

213,Amazing!,"I have stayed at the Herbert park many times, upon arrival I was upgraded to a suite, oh my word what a beautiful experience and a wonderful surprise on a wet and windy Friday evening! The suite was exquisite and the service top notch as always!",5,2023,10,23
213,Great hotel for business trip,"Stayed here for 3 nights for a work conference - ease on check-in, great location if attending RDS Exhibition Centre, staff friendly and attentive, and good facilities for meetings.  Food and drink selection plentiful and good standard.  The rooms felt clean, comfortable and had an executive feel to them.",5,2023,10,20
213,Our favourite Hotel,Had our umpteenth stay at Herbert park hotel last weekend....our 27th stay I think !...that speaks for itself.We love Herbert park for it's cool but freindly ambience...The rooms are all very stylish with lovely views of either the park or looking over Ballsbrige....Its location is perfect for a shopping trip in town...the Aviva for matches ...loads of local restaraunts but we always fit a trip to Al Buschetta and a drink at the Bridge pub .. .A walk in Herbert park is always refreshing followed by a lovely coffee in the hotel lobby ...We are always welcomed we always enjoy and always look forward to returning ....And thank you so so much for our upgrade last weekend we sooo enjoyed Thanku all so much 💚,5,2023,10,18
213,Excellent service and gorgeous rooms,We loved the hotel! At first we got upgraded to a different suite however it didn’t have a bathtub as I had really looked forward to. The manager was then so kind to upgrade our room once again and showed us three different rooms to choose from - extraordinary service that I have not previously seen in the hotel industry! Breakfast was good however we could have wished for a bit more of a variety - when staying more than 3 nights it kind of gets a bit boring. It was however tasteful and with excellent service. Loved it here!,5,2023,10,18
213,A really good place to have a sleep,"I was really tired of not good sleeping.I came to this hotel and the sleep was 10/10.They had clean rooms, polite ,happy to help people who work there and a really good breakfast.I also like the gym ,but it was really small,only for 2-3 people to workout together.",4,2023,10,17
213,Good location and great service,"Too expensive, as all Dublin hotels these days. Otherwise, excellent choice. Good breakfast (full Irish), exceptional stuff, very clean and quiet rooms. I genuinely enjoy my stay, and I plan to return. Thank you!",5,2023,10,16
213,"Nice service, but noisy disturbed sleep and not so picturesque views","On the upside, Herbert Park is clean and modern with nice service, although it doesn't have the charm of many Dublin hotels. And, sleep quality is a major downside. 

Overall, the service is very attentive. The rooms are spacious with a safe box and clothes press, which is handy for business travelers.  

The unfortunate downside was that my room (403)  faced a giant air-con unit. rather than some of the lovely views I had seen in the promos. 

I was able to fall asleep, however, in the early hours, I was awoken by the external air-con units which have the sound of an ongoing freight train. The only solution was to amp up the internal air-con to block out the noise.  
After connecting with colleagues, it appeared others who were allocated inward-facing rooms had similar experiences. 

Given the fundamental requirement of a hotel is a decent night's sleep, it's hard to recommend this hotel. If you do need to stay here, avoid any rooms facing internally, if possible. 

I also had a meal in the bar. The food was fine, the service was friendly. Although keep in mind, that whilst full meals are served (not just bar snacks)  most of the tables are coffee tables, rather than dining tables, so eating can be precarious. 

",3,2023,10,12
213,Watch your back accounts,"I booked a couple of nights for June 2024 back in August. My card was charged randomly now in October. I called right away when I saw the $500 charge. They apologized for the mistake and stated a refund was being issued, but did not explain why my card was charged.  That was Monday. Now Thursday I’m getting an email to survey my stay that supposedly was on 10/10!? Makes me weary to keep my reservation for 2024. And I still have not received my refund.",1,2023,10,12
213,Great hotel,"This is a great hotel - the staff are super friendly, the location is 10 minutes away from a DART so easy to access central Dublin, good bars and restaurants nearby and parking on site. Rooms are really comfy and clean. the food in the bar is good too and reasonably priced. We didn't eat in the main restaurant so can't comment on that. We ate at an Italian opposite the hotel and there are 2 good traditional bars just over the road for a Guiness (Mary Mac's and Paddy Cullens). 
Great hotel - we have stayed there 3 times now - in a classic room (lovely and spacious) and also an apartment (handy if you want to cook).",5,2023,10,09
213,Excellent location and service,"Good location at the park, allowing for practicing sports or walking. 
Location close to Aviva Stadium and RDS Arena. 
Excellent service, very friendly staff, very clean rooms. 
Rooms at the Residence allow for cooking and laundry - perfect for longer visits. 
",5,2023,10,09
213,Exceptional Service & Great Location,"I made a quick visit to Dublin (24 hours) from the USA to gather school books for my 12 year old daughter. Long story short it was 60 lbs worth of school books in a box that ripped. At 5 pm on a Saturday night only 12 hours away from my flight - exhausted and emotional. The staff at reception (all in their 20s) raced into action. They found a shipping box, ran across the street to get packing tape and packed up my items. They told me not to worry and get some sleep. The box was waiting for me at the front desk at the desk at 5 am. The staff went above and beyond - their professionalism and kindness will not be forgotten.",5,2023,10,09
213,A lovely stay in Ballsbridge,"The rooms in the park residence at this property are truly exceptional. Little apartments really equipped with everything you could need. I was able to do a load of laundry prior to my departure and returned home with clean clothes! My room was on the first floor and had a lovely terrace facing the park. One afternoon I even saw a very happy and healthy fox crossing past. The staff at the hotel were professional and helpful. The lobby is comfortable and the wifi was great. The property is located in a nice neighborhood in Dublin 4 with loads of restaurants, pubs, coffee shops and grocery stores all within walking distance. The Herbert Park Hotel & Park Residence was a perfect place to stay for my meeting in Dublin. Would recommend! ",5,2023,10,06
213,One of the worst ever stays ,"NEVER darken the door of this place. We were there for a business overnight. Waited 30 mins to check in and was given room with smoke odour, broken lights and dirty toilet. Staff were extremely rude.  One decent older bar staff person and the rest seemed to ignore everyone. I was literally standing there for 20 mins while they chatted, and the older guy did all the work. There seemed to be a TV crew and some people there and the staff found it more acceptable to talk about that than serve anyone. I heard three people complain about things in the short time I was there. The price is outrageous for a jaded hotel. Breakfast is outrageously priced, seeing as they don't have all dietary options.  The only thing going for it is location, but do yourself a favour, stay at The Mespil hotel, which isn't far and is usually far more reasonably priced with always excellent service. A proper 4 star unlike this place.",1,2023,10,05
213,Great experience with reception ,"It a was a really great experience during my business trip. Nives was very helpful guide me to visit all the place around and explain me the facilities of the hotel. 

I will definitely come back and I will recommend my friends. 
See you soon. ",5,2023,10,05
213,World class service and accommodation ,My favorite hotel  and pretty much my 3rd home. The staff are amazing and friendly and always look after me. They always provide me with world class service making my business travel very easy. Will always be me first choice visiting Dublin,5,2023,10,05
213,Great stay,"I recently had a pleasure of staying in Herbert Park Hotel and it exceeded all my expectations. All the staff provided exceptional service, I would particularly   want to mention Nives who went above and beyond to make sure my stay was comfortable and memorable, and Joe, who was always so kind and helpful. 
The room was clean and it had a beautiful view of the park. I can't wait to return in the future.",5,2023,10,03
213,Always great service,"As regular customers, we find excellent service here from front desk and dining room.

Especially IIona on front desk and Rupa.
John has helped us many times and goes beyond the call of duty.

Rooms very comfortable and well serviced by staff in housekeeping.",5,2023,10,03
213,Had to travel up to Dublin  from Wexford ,"Nice overnight stay in Dublin seemed like the best option,so stayed in the Herbert  hotel Ballsbridge. 
The front desk was welcoming and  helpful, our room upgraded to executive, that was pleasant and spacious  enough. We eat lunchtime in the bar area , and the food was very nice , if not a little expensive but we surpose that's Dublin . Couldn't fault our the food in the restaurant, our evening  meal was well presented and well cooked. Breakfast was good with a nice selection of both cooked and continental. We had booked a inclusive priced  room deal , breakfast and evening meal for 2 with a bottle of wine. So we were more than happy with that. However just beware as this hotel restaurant like many others ,for some reason want to charge Supplements on certain items on the menu.The menu is priced on the ala cart with stars denoting Supplement charges, If its priced why cant they just add it on to the price of that item. Or is it to catch people out? It always seems strange to us. The inclusive menu is not priced but we noted that also contained  Supplements?  For instance  a cheese board ? How can that be ? 🤔 you cant work out a price and if need be provide cheeses to that price, to us that is ridiculous.  So just beware , otherwise  the hotel would be fine, but that is a definite no for us. The Herbert  park is adjacent but at this time of year looked very uncared for, great  shame. Taxis to city centre reasonable from here.",4,2023,10,03
213,"Herbert Park Residence - modern, spacious, comfortable - we loved it.","The Residence - SO well appointed. Proper tea and coffee. Mini kitchen with microwave, dishwasher, washing machine/dryer, flatware etc. Beautifully designed space. Super comfy bed. Lovely shower room.",5,2023,10,02
213,Beautiful ❤️,A stunning hotel with beautiful decor.it was slightly on the pretentious side but appreciate the overall service given. My colleague was upgraded and the rooms were considerably different which I felt was unfair. Overall a beautiful stay however. ,4,2023,10,01
213,If you get a first floor room. Run away.,"Stayed in room 102. With a view of an internal courtyard full of industrial air con units. Dark, Dull, Noisy. Room also smelled like an ex-smoking room that has never been refitted since. Smelled stale.

When I asked to be moved was told that it was not possible so quite frankly left with no option but to close the curtains spray some deodorant to mask the smell and get on with it. 

Thoroughly disappointed ",1,2023,09,30
213,Great location!,"Herbert Park rooms have had a makeover and are truly stunning. Great location WITH PARKING within a 30-40 minute flat walk of the city centre. 
The staff are the biggest asset. Viktor st reception could not have been more helpful. 
A gentleman by the name of Arun from Sri Lanka looked after us for wine in the evening and great coffee in the morning. He is exceptional at Customer Care and does everything with a megawatt smile! Will absolutely stay here again.",5,2023,09,29
213,Awesome,"The beds and the rooms are generally the best I have ever seen. They are very spacious, well-lit, perfectly serviced all of which created a great ambience. The restaurant is also great.

It rained the first night and Vlad on reception saved the day by lending us his umbrella.  We had hors d’oeuvres in the bar next evening served by pleasant and helpful staff.  Rupa was on checkout and was both efficient and delightful, thereby making us want to come back - which we will certainly do.

213,Very pleasant hotel but needs work,"The hotel is really nice. The staff were very friendly and welcoming. The room was okay, definitely needs a little updating and unfortunately for us our view from our window was air cons and vents at the back of the hotel. Our bathroom also had no working ventilation for the shower which was quite annoying. My main gripe with our stay is that even though the room was pricey we still had to pay for parking. No hotel should charge for guest parking, the price of the stay should cover the cost.",3,2023,08,11
213,Family room provide NO makr up/clean up service! Don't BOOK!,"Their family room does not provide any make up / clean up service. You need to order new towels and garbage bags yourself and change it yourself. They don't clean your floors so you have to do it yourself too. My stay is 5 days. I weren't told about it until the 3 days! First, I thought they forgot, second day, they told me I have to pre-order a clean up, the third day, I were told I need to make the order 4 days ahead, which mans when they can come, I already left!!!",2,2023,08,10

213,Just a nice stay,"I have previously stayed here before, it is a fabulous hotel great location etc , majority of nice very nice , however we did encounter a rude member of staff both days same member, . Room lovely 1 or 2 areas need attention, breakfast is not included in price and comes at a cost of €23.90 ,  it does not reflect what you receive nobody came near us to ask if we wanted more tea/ coffee etc ,  rashers and sausage not good , if you want eggs Benedict or eggs royal it comes at a €5 supplement which is outrageous, so basically if you want eggs Benedict it costs €28.90
In saying all this it is a beautiful hotel just needs a few tweeks",3,2023,08,09
213,Hope to stay again,We stayed in this hotel as it was near the Aviva stadium and I have to say it was one of the best hotels I have been too. Room was fantastic. Very spacious with great tea and coffee making facilities. We did not eat in the hotel so I cannot comment on the food but it did look and smell great. The staff were exceptionally kind and helpful. And the cleanliness......I don't think I have been in a hotel as clean. Even the shower door was gleaming which is something most hotels can't get right. Cannot fault this hotel and look forward to returning.,5,2023,08,09
213,Another Great Stay.  Alex+Cathy,"Just back from another weekend at the Herbert Park Hotel,Dublin
Have been staying there each year at least once a year for the past 28years.
Hotel busy due to rugby and football at the nearby Aviva Stadium.
No matter how busy the stay is always personal and the service 1st class from the minute you go in the door until you leave.
Egle(General Manager) and all the the staff will go out of their way to assist you in anyway they can.
We arrived around lunchtime and had a short wait for our room to be ready which allowed us time to grab some lunch.
The 5th floor room allocated for our stay was up to the usual exceptional standard with a beautiful park view.
The signature rooms are beautifully appointed with all the usual luxuries.
The breakfast was the usual high standard and the dining room service was excellent with plenty of staff on hand.
Plenty of atmosphere around the lounge area with the events taking place but also room if you want some space to browse the newspapers provided.
Parking available on site 
The actual Herbert Park is but 20metres from the hotel door and is a beautiful place to relax , complete with tennis courts,football pitches and a modern children’s play area.
Rupa and the crew made the check out procedure simple and friendly and all too soon we had to leave.
As we have stated before there is simply no better hotel to stay in whilst visiting Dublin!

We can’t wait to return !!!!

Rooms are nicely decorated and well ventilated. Great value for money too. I would recommend for any couples or families looking for somewhere quiet on the outskirts of the city. RDS is close, walking distance to Aviva. City is a bit of a walk but on a dry day it's not too inconvenient and taxis are not expensive either as it's close by. Traffic getting to and from wasn't an issue either. Location is great.",5,2023,08,03
213,Great hotel close to the city ,"Excellent hotel, very spacious and well maintained room. Staff are very nice.

213,Great location and great amenities,"Stayed here for 1 night as the location was where I needed to be.

Very refreshing to see in a world where customer experience has been lacking ver the last few years. ",4,2023,07,24

The reception staff at check in were really friendly and accommodating with bags to hold for me ,5,2023,07,23
213,Ideal location and price but…,"An ok stay…location perfect for us as had appointment in Donnybrook and great deal for Dublin. However few issues added up. Problems at check in, system was down and had to wait 15 mins for room to be allocated. Wouldn’t have been a big deal if we didn’t have an appointment we needed to get to. 
Rooms fine and comfortable. Upgraded to executive king with package booked. Nice view of park. Never received bottle of Prosecco included in package, had actually forgotten about it until next morning, then told them at check out. They apologised and we were given bottle to take home.
Dining in lounge leaves a lot to be desired especially if vegetarian or vegan. When we asked the waiter for the vegetarian options he replied “the beef burger”, we corrected him. There was one vegan option of a vegan burger. Also found the seating in the lounge not very practical for dining, very low down but just my opinion.
Lastly we ordered breakfast to the room and husband was asked for service/tray charge on the spot. When asked could he pay on check out, he was told “no you have no credit”. First time we have ever encountered this in a hotel in Ireland. 
Overall it was fine, however I did end up cancelling 2 further nights I had booked for December based on this stay and rebooked elsewhere. Would say location perfect, price excellent and fine for a night but if vegan or vegetarian dine elsewhere.

First impressions were very favourable with registration completed efficiently and quickly. Our room was spacious, clean, and had all the facilities we desired such as an excellent coffee machine which also provided hot water for tea. We asked, separately, for an electric kettle and it was delivered promptly.
Friendly and helpful staff is always a bonus for residents and the Herbert can feel proud of those employees who either cleaned our room or assisted us with queries at reception.
Another plus point was the excellent breakfast. No one would have gone away either hungry or disappointed with the variety and quality of food on offer reflecting well on the catering staff.
To sum up. We would thoroughly recommend the Herbert. Its location is in close proximity to restaurants, shops, etc. and is an ideal place as a location explore more of Dublin.

As the room rate was expensive, I didn’t appreciate paying for the parking on top of that. ",4,2023,07,10
213,A nice hotel ,"The hotel is clean, the staff are friendly, efficient and very helpful. The food is very good and the tea and coffee in the restaurant are very good. The bed was reasonably comfortable but not as soft as our own and so were the pillows but no memory foam topper, which is a good thing as that makes me far too hot and unable to sleep. If you don't like the Nespresso machine in the room you can ask for a kettle and bigger cups. The only downside is the price and you have to pay for parking on top. But Dublin is an expensive place. All in all it was a good stay and we would go again. ",5,2023,07,10

213,"Herbert Park Hotel is beautiful, comfortable and staff are so friendly and professional.  Also spotlessly clean hotel.","What a fab hotel, with the most friendly and helpful staff.  It is situated on the park so lovely for a walk in the evening or after breakfast.  It is  a lovely area of the city with regular public buses to the city centre (shopping area) which is approx 10-15 mins by bus away. We were upgraded on arrival.  The room was really good.  Very clean.  Breakfast was excellent.  We had dinner in the restaurant on our first night, it was very good but expensive.  Gokhan was attending our table and he was so professional and attentive.  We ate in the lobby on the other evenings and the food was equally as nice but a little cheaper but the seating arrangement is not as good or comfortable for eating at.  Tables are low.  We dealt mainly with Vlad at the reception area on arrival and during our stay and he was very friendly, professional and helpful.  The hotel was so nice that we decided last minute to stay an extra night.  We met a lovely lady at reception (sorry I did not get her name) and she arranged that we held the same room for the extra night.  All in all, there is nothing to fault at this hotel, only to praise.  I will be back again shortly. ",5,2023,07,04
213,Dublin 4 Gem,"I can definitely recommend The Herbert Park Hotel in Ballsbridge Dublin. The hotel is well situate in the heart of Dublin 4, Close to The Aviva Stadium, RDS and a host of excellent restaurants. I have stayed here many times and always found the staff to be extremely helpful. The rooms are a good size for a city hotel and an upgrade to an executive room is worth the extra cost. I cannot recommend this hotel highly enough. ",5,2023,07,04

213,Good stay and comfortable room!,"Lovely hotel with great service from staff. We were in one of the apartment suites which has great amenities including, dishwasher, washing machine, fridge, kettle, coffee machine, hob and oven. The bathroom was large and had underfloor heating and the bed was very comfortable. We had an issue with a window in our room on arrival and when alerted to it the staff arrived promptly to fix the issue. I would say, mostly based on the location, parking is very limited at times so take this into account when booking but most hotels in the area will have this issue. Overall was a nice stay and would return! ",4,2023,07,03
213,Another wonderful stay at the Herbert .,"I’ve stayed many times in the Herbert Park hotel and can honestly say I’ve so enjoyed every time .

The bed was extremely comfortable and we had a great night's sleep. We didn't avail of breakfast as it was very pricey and there are lots of options close by, Mister Magpie just across the road will get you started for the day.

213,Wake up call at 8.40am,"Have stayed in this hotel before and loved it, however on this occasion what started as a perfect getaway for my husband and I, was ruined when a member of housekeeping knocked us up at 8.40 to clean the room we were not checking out of until 12.
I made the general manager aware of this when we were leaving only to be told it was my fault for not displaying the Do not Disturb sign on the door.
The hotel should have a system whereby they notify housekeeping when guests have checked out.",1,2023,06,29

213,Herbert Park Hotel,"It was a comfortable hotel - very clean and I loved the beds.  However, it's location leaves a lot to be desired.  There are very few choice available for nearby restaurants within walking distance.  Also, if you want to purchase bottles of water or soft drinks, you have to cross a very busy road to a local convenience store.  ",3,2023,06,28

Our standard room was clean and comfortable, and the staff were also friendly and welcoming, making the check-in process quick and  stress-free.

213,Terrible room and poor reception,"Room was like something from the 70's and reception staff were cold and mechanical. I had booked a Classic King Double room and was given a musty twin room with antique bathroom overlooking the air conditioning on one of the hottest days of the year. I complained about the state of the room and the beds and was given an equally terrible musty Double bed room, one floor down and close to the air conditioning system that ran 24/7.",1,2023,06,15

213,Not a 4 star hotel at all,"Firstly the parking is a disaster in this place. Underground car park was full and no signs to say so. I had to go to the hotel and ask where to park. Really unnecessary and stressful start. When checking in I discussed this with the girl at the desk and she just said they were busy with events….and…am I not a guest too?
Anyways we got our room and it was okay. Some patches on the bath of damage. Bed was so hard. Not if you like comfort: small tv in the room.
Staff at the bar didn’t know what to serve with the tanqueray gins we ordered. We had to tell them. Some contractors doing some electrical work when we were outside stepping in front of us and just “sorry lads”. Not once but at least twice. 
Was extremely average and at best a 3 star: zero ambience in the bar. We won’t be back.",3,2023,06,09

213,Distinctly average stay,"Reception staff aren't particularly friendly or helpful. When asked if housekeeping could come and make our room seeing as we were staying there for 3 nights they asked us how many nights we were staying and then outright refused which was strange. It also says on their website they offer airport transfer, which they don't. When going through booking.com, it mentioned we had breakfast included but when we got there, it wasn't included but kind of glad because when we did pay extra for the full breakfast one morning, it was basic so chose to go elsewhere for the remainder of our stay. I've had better breakfasts at Tescos Cafe.",3,2023,06,07

The team in accommodations both via email and in person were super helpful and accommodating. I had a last minute change/ask and the reservations manager was able to help me out with it (I didn't get her name). Adam helped us out with the event, when I checked the evening before the room set up wasn't as asked however when we came in the next morning it was perfect and Adam had been able to get the team to fix it per our original requests, he was also able to accommodation some last minute asks from our team with clearing the room between sessions and extra chairs. I appreciated him checking in with me to make sure things were on track during the day. Everyone was friendly and really helpful. The breakfast was tasty and always had plenty of food out. The hotel itself was clean and tidy and they were able to help us grab a taxi when needed otherwise its about a 20-30 minute walk into the city center. ",5,2023,06,06

",5,2023,05,30
213,Avoid this hotel,"If you value getting good sleep, I would avoid this hotel. The rooms are littered with bright lights. Most of them can be turned off but that also turns off the outlets and means your phone and other devices wont be able to charge overnight. There is also a bright green light on the ceiling. This is separate from the fire alarm. The staff could not tell me the purpose of it and they refused to help. The rooms are very hot at night, the bed is horrible and the pillows are cheap.

A great experience overall.

213,Sadly average,"Beautiful room and great location but really let down by lack of attention to detail and to guests.

Didn’t feel like the team were bothered about guests or guest needs, was particularly shocked at out of date milk and supplies for one person when we were there for two nights. 

Very busy after concert, hotel needed to think through the needs of their paying guests returning versus people calling in for a drink or to pay for car parking. We were challenged getting in, to prove we were staying there and then faced with queues of non-residents at the bar. 

Underwhelming experience when I was expecting to be wowed.",3,2023,05,14
213,Good location but poor attention to detail,"Ballsbridge is fab and Herbert Park could be too with a little more attention to detail.

A nice quiet neighbourhood, which still has some restaurants & cafes nearby. 

Connections to center are nearby as well, bus lines 4 and 7A run in a high frequency (bring coins or buy a visitors' LEAP card at the airport). We also walked to the center, as the Merrion Square-side is only around a 20-25 minutes’ walk away.

Hotel clean and efficient but room
decor tired and requires updating
For that price I think breakfast ought to be included. ",3,2023,03,29
213,Location ideal for Aviva but otherwise wouldn’t stay again.,"Location is ideal for the Aviva and was reasonably priced. Few issues during our stay which I would have liked to have discussed during check out, the air con in our room was permanently on with no means off turning off. We tried several times including during the middle of the night and the off button did not work. We got no sleep whatsoever. We then both woke with sniffles and sore throat from cold air blowing on us all night, so unpleasant. The cleaning staff on our floor should be spoken to regarding their tone and voice control, at 8am we were woken after very little sleep as per above by loud voices from the cleaning staff, talking, laughing, banging doors as they went in/out cleaning and generally making quite a lot of noise when people are trying to sleep and rest. The whole purpose of us booking the night was to rest after a long drive and before making the long journey home. We left feeling very tired, sniffly from the aircon and sore throat, feeling let down and would put us off staying again. ",3,2023,03,28

If I were to pick out 1 person in particular, it would have to be Joseph, in the restaurant.     His attention to detail with both the customer and the manner in which he served the table has to be of at least a five star restaurant.   Joseph dealt with us and all other customers in a truly friendly and professional manner and your Company are so lucky to have an employee of such a high standard.

I did not realize they did not clean the room up every day so I was there for four days without a clean up, not ideal. I was told it was done once a week in the residence part once I got there.  But my own fault since I had not read the small print. It was totally fine, everything there that I could need, the bed was wonderful, very comfy and I loved the pillow and duvet, the main entrance is nice, nice seating area for drinks and chats, all was very clean when I arrived, not so much after four days of staying with no clean up.

From the moment we arrived, Rupa made us feel welcome and went above and beyond to celebrate my fiance's birthday. Our room was ready early, was absolutely incredible, and everyone we interacted with was exceptionally nice. I would recommend this hotel to anyone looking to stay in the Ballsbridge area.

213,Best sleep away from home.,"Herbert Park Hotel was highly recommended to me by a family friend and it did not disappoint!
Having arrived early morning off a red eye from the states, we had requested an early check-in, if available, and to our surprise we had been shown our room before 8:00am by some of the friendliest and patient staff in the hospitality business. 
The room we were given overlooked the park and was immaculately clean.  The bed, pillows, and comforter were fantastic.  The water pressure (big one for me) in the shower and sink were perfect.  The walls must be thick because there were no noise disturbances for us as we slept through the nights and enjoyed room service in the mornings. 
The hotel turn down service were like ninjas, we never saw them, they were so fast, our room was always restocked, cleaned, and made up good as new.  There was an excellent choice of espresso and tea every day and yes, I drank them all.
As we ventured our each morning the staff would great us and ask if there was anything we needed or would like, this extra effort on their part left a big impression. When we arrived back in the evenings we were welcomed by an inviting lounge area just off the lobby floor which includes a full bar with table service, and a restaurant just beyond that. I also visited the hotel gym a number of times and it was very clean and well kept. 
Herbert Park Hotel does an amazing job at making you feel welcome and ensuring you are getting every penny's worth of your money. I will be returning to this hotel every time I am in Dublin from now on. 
 Thanks again to the staff!",5,2023,03,19

213,The lovely Herbert park!,"We have had a brilliant experience at the Herbert park hotel ! We had some issues with the room due to health issues , however when we explained this to Neves (a lovely receptionist) she was MORE than accommodating. She found us another (equally lovely room) that sadly still didn’t meet our needs for health issues. When we explained this to her, she then found us another STUNNING room. We cannot recommend this hotel enough, it is very clean and beautifully decorated. The people who work there are so lovely and accommodating to your every need. BEST hotel experience we have had. Will definitely be back!",5,2023,03,11

Fine rooms with great beds.",5,2023,03,09
213,Wonderful stays,"We travel over regularly to Dublin for business and pleasure  from Florida  and  stay in the Herbert Park apartments. We always have a truly wonderful time. The apartments are spotless and very well maintained. A home away from home. The breakfast and the bar for drinks/ bar food are both great experiences. It is a super location, with a lot of fun bars and restaurants around the area. It  is however the people that truly make the place. Shonagh always deals with our reservations and responds extremely promptly and professionally. Rupa, at reception, is always friendly, extremely customer service orientated and always greets us after a long flight with a smile!

Joe in the bar area is  fantastic.  He  engages with his customers and gives the lounge a very relaxed yet businesslike feel. The lounge is cozy and inviting and Joe is always there to meet, greet and look after guests.

So, for us, this is a home away from home and we highly recommend staying here. ",5,2023,03,08
213,A nice surprise by the park,"We didn't know about Herbert Park Hotel until our second trip to Dublin. It was a lovely stay there. We booked an apartment and It was fully equipped with all the necessary and more. The views from the room of the park were perfect and also the location, in a very quite tranquil neighborhood.

213,"Perfect, outstanding for Dublin","The staff at reception could not have been more helpful - very enjoyable interactions each time I passed through. Rupa, on reception, seemed to make the whole place bend to her will and, given that i had stayed in the hotel a couple of nights before, upgraded me. A charming presence in, imho, the most perfectly located hotel in Dublin. They staff are very conscious of building the hotel's reputation and you could feel that in the restaurant, at reception and in the bar. The price was excellent (but beware, Dublin will be stupidly expensive in the coming months) and they suggest to always call them directly and avoid booking.com.",5,2023,03,07
213,Great Place to Stay in Dublin,"This special hotel is nestled beside the lovely Herbert Park in beautiful Ballsbridge.  A pleasant 30-minute walk gets you to the South City Centre and provides a great opportunity to get to know the South City.  The hotel enjoys good bus and rail services (Lansdowne Road station for rail) and is situated beside the RDS venue and close to the Aviva Stadium.  Staff are friendly, helpful and efficient.  The main car park is underground but some surface level parking is also available.  The hotel reception area, lounge and dining room are beautifully designed and decorated.  Our favourite bedrooms are those directly overlooking Herbert Park.  The beds are large and comfortable.  Bathroom facilities are very good.  Face cloths are provided as are separate toiletries for each guest.  If a separate, stand-alone shower is a priority (as opposed to showering in the bath), guests should request a refurbished room (we understand that a refurbishment programme is ongoing).  A good selection of television channels is available and tea and coffee-making facilities are provided, as is a complimentary copy of a business magazine.  As in all hotels, the air-conditioning controls tend to be a bit of a mystery!  If we were to suggest one improvement to the room experience, it would be to switch to glass bottles for the complimentary water offered to guests.  This would be more in keeping with the standard of this hotel.  A very good breakfast is provided in the dining room overlooking Herbert Park or can be ordered to your room.  For other meals, good food and wine is available in the lounge, the dining room or using room service.  There is an attractive bar with a good drinks list.  To sum up, this is a hotel you will look forward to returning to again and again.",5,2023,03,06
213,Apartments booked by accident but brilliant mistake!,"previous visit was excellent. We had  a family room and they looked after us well with my late Mother. She accidentally  left her handbag in the foyer lavatory and it was returned to us intact with all contents present.Impressed !

This visit was an apartment and it was ideal. The staff were excellent, from met and greet at reception to the room service staff.
I booked  the apartment by mistake but we were so impressed we  will continue to book them in future as the flexibility of the apartments  is wonderful. All fixtures and fittings top class.

213,Lovely stay,"We stayed here for a concert in the 3 arena. We had a very pleasant stay. Location was good and the room was nice. Huge king size bed which was very comfortable.

213,Short stay for US embassy visit and touring Dublin,Great location. Modern and clean hotel with good breakfast and friendly staff. Car park very small but I did get a space. Checkin was great and early checkin was requested and granted as I was arriving very early from the ferry.  I would definitely stay again. My room was opposite the lifts so a little loud with other guests talking and running water pipes making a lot of noise now and then. Otherwise I had a good sleep and the room was convenient to find. ,5,2023,03,06
213,Brilliant location and bright rooms.,Hotel is very nicely located.  Nice entrance and helpful staff. Big room but could do with a refresh to contemporise. Good value for money. Restaurant food good and service efficient and friendly. Parking 12€ per night. ,4,2023,03,06

The hotel is in a great location with everyone you need within walking distance. ",5,2023,03,04
213,Disappointing,"Overall hotel needs updating, furniture bit shabby
Room cold.
Food below average.
Hard bread for sandwich and on another occasion luke warm tea. (Room service).
Which isn’t cheap. Fridge could have been stocked better with snacks.",2,2023,03,03

213,Fantastic Hotel with even better staff,I stayed at the Herbert Park Hotel whilst attending a conference in February. The hotel was great but the staff were even better and made the whole stay 10/10. I have to particularly mention John Hurley who's service was second to none.,5,2023,03,02
213,"Great location, sleep and in-room products here","I have stayed at the Herbert Park Hotel a handful of times and love to return. I expect good quality and comfort at their price point and I have never found a fault. The rooms are great, no street noise, luxurious, clean and with some nice products provided.

Breakfast has plenty of choice between hot and cold, with some nice local Irish products such as their yoghurt pots. 5 stars.",5,2023,03,01
213,Perfect stay!,Highly recommend this hotel. Just to be aware it’s 12e parking for the night but you can go in and out of parking all day. Everything’s a 10/10. Got upgraded room too which was a lovely surprise. Hotel staff go above and beyond for the clients. Easy check in and out. Will most definitely stay here again as location is perfect. ,5,2023,03,01
213,Average,Room was bog standered looked nothing like it did on the website. Really dated. One member of staff was extremely unhelpful while checking in. Overall average enough stay at your hotel. Wouldn’t be returning in a hurry ,3,2023,02,28

213,Professional and clean over personable and keen,"Pleasant stay in a very clean and comfortable, light apartment in a gorgeous part of the city. 
Partly let down by a lack of response to feedback regarding room freshen (servicing every 2 nights?) and a lack of information on arrival. Felt corporate and a bit cold rather than cosy and welcoming.",3,2023,02,26
213,Catex 2023,Rooms expensive and basic but breakfast was good. The location was good. I don't think you should charge car parking. What add-ons will you have when the vat reverts back to 13.5%. I can get a two night break in a 5 star hotel in Paris for €280. So  €370 for two nights plus parking is really a rip off.,3,2023,02,26
213,Amazing place to stay,"The staff,  the room,  cleanliness,  comfort... all perfect. 
I don't have 1 bad word to say about this place... and it's also not to far a walk from Grafton Street if you want to go do some gift shopping. 
The Herbert Park will be my go to hotel every time in in Dublin from now on.  So much better than the others. ",5,2023,02,26
213,Comfortable,"The location was ideal, lovely hotel parking was great as they have onsite car park.

213,Lovely hotel in nice location,"Was in Dublin for a few business meetings and stayed at the Herbert Park Hotel. The rooms were very comfortable and well-appointed, and the breakfast options were plentiful. Situated right next to Herbert Park, it was so nice to be able to walk around a bit after a long day of meetings but still be in close proximity to the hotel.

213,Fabulous Dublin Location,"Stayed for a weekend in Dublin and wanted walking distance access to the centre of Dublin.  The Herbert Park hotel is about a 30 minute walk from the centre and is in such a lovely, green area of the city, it's well worth the extra distance.  There are a few really nice cafes, restaurants and bars in the local area - so for me, had everything you want in a stay in Dublin to balance the touristy centre with pleasant surroundings.  Rooms are great and really clean too.",5,2023,02,20

Close to some good restaurants.  ",5,2023,02,10

213,Great hotel!,"Great service. Great personell. I want to highlight Vlad who was extremely kind and supportive here.

The location is decent, there are great possibilities to buy food etc next to the hotel but also the food is extremely good in their lounge. The lounge is very comfortable too; I loved the couches. The gym does it’s job. Some heavier weights would have been good. 

Only thing to mention: changing the soap on a daily basis is not necessary and in times of climate change I can’t understand some service topics eg. water in plastic bottles, new soap, shampoo etc. Would be great if there’s a system to let the staff know that this is not necessary.",5,2023,02,01

Breakfast was lovely and staff were excellent really friendly and helpful.

213,"""Never Disappoints""","My wife and I returned to the Herbert Park Hotel for two nights last week and as on previous visits, we had a most pleasant stay. The hotel is spotlessly clean and staff were so friendly and helpful at all times.

We had a beautiful comfortable room, breakfast was fantastic and the food in the lobby was excellent and great value. We look forward to returning again soon.",5,2023,01,19

213,Late booking,I required a hotel with close proximity to the RDS at short notice. The Herbert Park Hotel not only ideally located and with parking available was ideal. The hotel exceeded my expectations as I was only staying one night but  I enjoyed both the comforts of the room along with the hotel facilities. ,5,2023,01,15
213,Great location,This is a modern and comfortable hotel. The rooms are clean and comfortable. But the noise insulation with other rooms is not great probably because our room was communicating with the other room. They talked laughed and partied until 4 and we heard them.,5,2023,01,15

AC and Heater are easily adjusted, and kicked in almost immediately. Location is superb. A bakery/pastry cafe, a bar and pizza joint, and a Chinese restaurant are nearby. Buses to downtown are easy to catch. All staff are also warm, welcoming, and friendly. Thank you Herbert Park Hotel and Park Residence for memorable stay. We are so impressed, and we will definitely come back for another visit.",5,2023,01,12
213,Excellent hotel in great location,This hotel is very conveniently located close to Ballsbridge and in addition  to its own facilities on site is close to pubs and eateries.

Staff were very uniformly pleasant and generally very accommodating. ,5,2023,01,12

Can't wait to return.,5,2023,01,10

213,Rude & and obnoxious Staff,"Lounge staff were rude & obnoxious.
Other onlookers/paying guests were shocked and offered their seats.

At breakfast we were informed that we would be charged for breakfast that we didn’t have - and to add insult to injury -we were then informed that it had already been charged to our room and it couldn’t be reversed!!!! 
Luckily the reception staff were a bit more understanding and helpful!",3,2023,01,03
213,Heating,I found the staff very friendly and obliging.  Hotel is very clean and well presented.  Because I found the communal areas to be too cool for me it would affect my choice in winter. I realize heating is expensive but this did effect my enjoyment. ,4,2023,01,03
213,Modern and clean,"Fabulous room. Super clean. Friendly staff. Good shower and bath. Little extras like dressing gowns/slippers were a nice touch. Plenty of toiletries. Good view of the park from the balcony.
Didn't dine at the hotel as there didn't appear to be any vegan options. This was the only dissapointment. But the room had a small kitchenette so we made use of that instead. ",5,2023,01,02

213,Lovely hotel surrounded by great eateries,"When the only fault you can find with a hotel room is a lack of coat hooks, you know you’ve found somewhere pretty good!
Lovely people, handy for the city centre, surrounded by great bars and restaurants and a short drive from some beautiful seaside towns.",5,2022,12,23
213,Perfect stay at Herbert Park,I was very impressed with Herbert Park and wished I could have stayed longer. The hotel is bright and modern and the decor in the rooms is nice. I found the staff particularly helpful and it was a nice surprise that when I went to pay for the parking they said it was fine and they wouldn't charge. Overall great experience. I am looking forward to going back on a personal trip as this time it was for work.,5,2022,12,20

213,"Luxury Hotel in Idyllic Setting (Embassy Belt), Dublin 4","The Herbert Park Hotel is a Luxury Hotel, in a peaceful setting, on the doorstep of Herbert Park and yet within easy reach of Dublin City, a City with so much to offer.  The Hotel is in a league of it's own and if I could I would give it 5 Stars.   The service and overall standard far exceeds other 4 Star Hotels in South Dublin where I have recently stayed.  Aside from the location, what makes the Herbert Park hotel special is the Management and Staff.  The Receptionists were friendly and most helpful.  Nives, Viktor, Shonagh and others, whose names escape me, were delightful and always most accommodating.  Breakfast in the dining room is an occasion not to be missed.  Guests are spoiled for choice.  The food is not only fresh and beautifully displayed, but it is also nutritious.  As my stay was lengthy, I feel a need to mention those who went out of their way to make me feel at home.    From the moment I arrived at the hotel, I felt welcome and priviledged to be able to call the Herbert Park my temporary home.  Each morning, I was welcomed in the dining room by Silva Nallan, the Restaurant Manager, known for his kind nature and warm smile. Silva ensures everyone feels special and nothing is too much trouble.  Restaurant staff, including  Delia, Alfredo, Berkay, Roberta, Vianca were also friendly and eager to please. The Head Chef, Kevin R., was never far away if needed.  Another key player was the Director of Operations,  Nutu Radu.  Nutu wears many hats and ensures concerns are immediately addressed, even if this means putting in long hours.  Thanks to the excellent housekeeping and maintenance staff the Hotel is spotlessly clean and very well maintained.  Special thanks to Lidico, who ensured my room was spick and span;  Also, special thanks to Anton, who has a magic touch and goes out of his way to be helpful.  Another Jewel in the Crown is Joe, whose kind nature is comforting at the end of a busy day.  Last, but by no means least, I wish to convey special thanks to the General Manager, Egle Tamosauskaite, who oversees this charming Hotel and is never too busy to listen to concerns staff or guests might have.  For a hotel to run as smoothly as the Herbert Park Hotel does, one can only assume the hotel is well managed and people are more important than profit.  For me, the Herbert Park Hotel is one of Dublin's finest Hotels if you appreciate a peaceful setting and a service par excellence.   Season's Greetings to Management and Staff and looking forward to seeing you in January.  Have a safe and happy holiday.  A.C.

Also the s,","Smelly and unclean，I often stay in hotels and this was the worst experience I've ever had. I'm disappointed. Also the soundproofing is very poor, not only the next room can hear it, their cleaners start working early in the morning, However, they did not take into account the fact that there were guests sleeping, they chatted loudly, and the overall service was poor.",1,2022,12,17
213,Large but friendly hotel in a good location,We chose to stay in the Herbert Park Hotel originally because it has car parking available.  We return each year because the hotel has a lovely atmosphere and friendly staff and while it is not in the city centre it is close by. Compared to city centre hotels it is also good value with a great breakfast. ,5,2022,12,14
213,Hidden Gem with a great welcome in quiet Dublin 4,"The Herbert Park Hotel is a hidden gem in the heart of Ballsbridge, Dublin 4. We stayed in a Double King Room which is larger than double rooms in other hotels, comes with two full size armchairs and an upright chair for the desk. 

The team really made a difference by going above and beyond to make us comfortable during a very cold spell of arctic weather. Many thanks to Nives and Rupa at Guest Services, and to Shiva in the dining room and Kevin, Head Chef for making us feel so welcome! 

Room rates and food are excellent. The location is very convenient for leisurely walks into town. 

We will look forward to another visit!",5,2022,12,13

213,Great location & helpful staff,"This Hotel is very well located if visiting for leisure or business.  There are very frequent buses & bus stops either side of the hotel.  The car park is not huge but we managed to get a space with the help of a member of staff. 
Very clean rooms & public areas.  
The breakfast is nice, I would like to see pancakes to order instead of the precooked ones.  
I would definitely stay here again & would happily recommend. ",5,2022,12,04

213,Not recommended for the worlds one billion disabled people due to poor accessibility.,"Terrible hotel design shows a severe lack of understanding of disability. No accessible entrance so had to wait for help to enter the double set of heavy glass swing entrance doors. No accessible reception desk so had to shout over the high reception desk to check in and then sign the paperwork on a portable clipboard. No twin accessible rooms despite many disabled people travelling with an assistant. ‘Accessible’ double room 135 had an unsuitable small bathroom with a narrow door, standard bath, no separate shower, a sink that was behind the door and ugly plastic rails. Poor attitude of staff when asked if there were rooms with a shower a wheelchair user could use. No offer of help with luggage. No window blinds for privacy during the day even though the room had large windows facing straight into the street. Excellent breakfast but overall a disappointing stay.",1,2022,12,02

We had dinner and breakfast, and both were delicious. The breakfast has everything you would want, one of the best we have ever encountered in an hotel. The staff are brilliant. Because of an air-con issue, we were upgraded (without asking) to a beautiful room overlooking the park. We came away totally satisfied.",5,2022,11,24

213,Very pleasant stay,"Quiet apartment, very cozy. The bed was very comfortable and the shovery quite spacious.There was everything we needed. The location of the hotel is not too central, but it's well connected to the city center by buses. I just might recommend to the staff just to add a couple of basic ingredients to the kitchen, like salt and oil, so that guests don't have to buy them for short stays. Except for this the kitchen was equipped well enough.",5,2022,11,22

213,Excellent Stay,"We arrived from Singapore around 9am. Hotel gave us an early check in with no issues at all and they even gave us a complimentary upgrade. As Airfrance had lost one of our suitcases the hotel kept an eye out for it to be delivered and called our room immediately to let us know it had arrived. We extended by 1 night on the Sat of the Ire v SA Rugby match and despite limited availability they allowed us to keep
Our same  upgraded room. Special mention to Rupa and Eugenia on the front desk for the efficiency and caring manner in making guests feel at home and genuinely well treated. About 9 out of 10 for the buffet breakfast. Very friendly Maitre D/Restaurant Manager from Mauritius greeted us at the entrance. Overcooked Sirloin in the evening but was good quality otherwise. Super convenient location for attending events at the RDS Simmons Court or The Aviva for the Rugby Internationals. Just 7 mins walk to the Aviva. Great selection of restaurants and bars in the Vicinity. Particular mention to Roly’s Bistro and Crowes Pub. Good service and quality in both. ",5,2022,11,20
213,"Lovely hotel, great location but let down by floor staff",Reception staff were very helpful and friendly - floor staff during the day and in the evening were impatient and seemed to be put out by our being there. We had travelled for a football match so perhaps that isn’t the calibre of guests they hope to attract. Disappointing as we have been to Dublin lots of times for various reasons and have never experienced this lack of respect before,3,2022,11,17

We arrived pretty early after an early flight, we asked if we could leave our bags so that we could go out knowing that our room wouldn't be ready until 3/4pm. Bonus, our room was ready, well, small apartment, it was gorgeous and everything you need for a couple nights stay, loved the coffee machine.
The hotel was close to amenities and a lovely park.

They went the extra mile on the last morning of our trip in getting our COVID test results for 7 in our party when there was a tech glitch in getting them to us.

Very pricey for a very old-fashioned hotel.
Wouldn’t stay again, unless I was desperate.",3,2022,10,26
213,Anniversary city break,"Stayed here for business and decided it was a perfect hotel for our Dublin city break. We arrived in Dublin on an early flight with the intention of dropping our luggage before going sight seeing, however to out delight our room was available meaning we could shower and freshen up first. Check in process was seamless. The room was spacious, comfortable and everything we needed for our 2 day trip. The hotel location is perfect, we arrived via the 702 Air coach which stops directly opposite the nearby RDS and picks up for the return from directly outside the RDS - easy. Ballsbridge is a great location, with plenty of nearby bars and restaurants and a steady 30 min stroll into Dublin centre. Would recommend and we'll certainly stay again. ",5,2022,10,26

213,Fantastic Hotel with great Service,"My husband and I have just returned from a wonderful 1-night stay in the Herbert Park Hotel and can only say how thrilled we were with our visit. We arrived in the morning and met a most pleasant, welcoming and helpful man at the reservations desk, who, to our surprise and delight, allowed us to check in immediately. (I could not properly see his name on his badge, but it began with the letter D and indeed, he is a real asset to the hotel). The surprises kept coming, because when we opened the door to our room on the 5th floor, we were blown away by the beautiful view over Herbert Park, as well as the cleanliness, brightness and modern furnishings and amenities that were in the room. The bathroom was pristine & spacious with a generous supply of gorgeous toiletries and containing both a bath and separate shower. When we returned to our room in the evening, a bottle of Prosecco on ice awaited us - no detail was overlooked. All the food was delicious and served beautifully. D attended to us again at check-out with the same pleasantness & professionalism, leaving us with a great sense of positivity towards the hotel. Thank you D & thank you to all the staff.

213,Always a great visit,"I’ve stayed at the Herbert Park Hotel a number of times this year and the level of service has always been fantastic. The reception staff are always so helpful with no request ever seeming like any trouble. A special thank you to Rupa on my most recent stay for her assistance. 

 Rooms are spacious and have everything you’d need for a stay. Beds are comfortable but the only negative I would have are the pillows which I’d also read on some other reviews. That said, it’s my only minus to many pluses for this hotel. 

Food is delicious and room service always arrived piping hot. I would definitely choose this hotel again.",5,2022,10,18
213,brilliant service,"The service we received at the Herbert Park Hotel was absolutely first-class.

Well done and thanks to everyone!
Happy and very satisfied Sharks Rugby",5,2022,10,11
213,Incredibly overpriced,"Stayed here for 2 nights Oct 7-9 2022.Paid just over 530 euro and for that I expect high quality. Room was small and very basic, small TV, bed was 2 smaller beds pushed together, walls were paper thin could hear couple next door talking, shower was in the bath so to speak. I could have saved myself 300 euro and had the same quality or perhaps slightly better at a Premier in. Room was clean that was the only positive.",1,2022,10,10
213,Disgraceful for the price,"My partner and I booked an ""executive"" room for the weekend, two nights was 540euro.
Entering the hotel had a very luxurious feeling, everything was pristine and staff was very professional.  
Upon entry of the ""executive"" room I noticed it was quiet small to what I was expecting, the only thing that stood out was the very large bed, when we got into bed later that night we noticed it was just TWO LARGE SINGLE BEDS PUT TOGETHER, this apparently was a ""king sized bed"".
The WALLS WERE VERY THIN, we got woken up during the night with NEXT DOOR HAVING SEX , we could even hear them talking.

Parking was 12euro per night and a pint was just over 7 euro, a gin and tonic was nearly 10 euro.
We also ordered food to the hotel on one night and they refused to bring the food to the room due to ""security reasons"" (??)

Absolutely WOULD NOT stay here again, both my partner and I feel we got ripped off for 560euro (inc parking). 
DunBoyne caste is the same price including breakfast with an inhouse spa and they treat you like absolute royalty.

(reception said the only difference between a double room and exec room was the ""large bed"" and a couple of robes.)",1,2022,10,10
213,Excellent expierence,"Excellent Hotel good experience all round. Staff helpful and friendly especially Rupa, she couldn't do enough to help me with my arrangements. Great location, good food and efficient friendly staff, it all added up to make my business trip easier to manage.",4,2022,10,07

213,Amazing support staff,We hosted an event at the hotel. Bernie and Adam were wonderful support throughout the event. From set up to close down. Nothing was an issue or burden to them. They went beyond the call of duty in terms of service.,4,2022,09,24
213,Very Comfortable Stay,"I have stayed at this hotel a couple of times already. The area close to restaurants, bars and coffee shop. I would choose to stay at Herbert Park Hotel again.

No complaints only recommendations",5,2022,09,20
213,Great hotel in a great location,We had an excellent stay. The staff were super friendly and very helpful. There are several restaurants in close walking distance. My only minor complaint would be the gym - it’s really small and the equipment is inadequate ,5,2022,09,19

213,Perfect location for the RDS,My first visit to the Herbert Park Hotel but it will not be my last. Great location for the RDS and events at that venue. Very friendly helpful staff throughout the hotel. Clean and tidy room with all the required facilities although the Nespresso machine is not easy to operate until you have the hang of it.  Food in the Terrace bar area was excellent and far busier than sitting in the formal restaurant.,4,2022,09,15
213,"Great location,  lovely hotel","This was just an overnight stay to attend a concert.  The hotel is very good, comfortable, clean and welcoming. Staff were very busy, but were friendly and professional in all our dealings. Great situation for visiting city centre with great public transport links.  The only issue was cost, which is a general issue in Dublin hotels at the moment. We didn't eat in the hotel so I can't comment on this.  But  I would stay here again if visiting Dublin.

213,Super Hotel,"We stayed in Herbert Park for two nights last weekend and had a wonderful experience. From the moment you enter the lobby, the spaciousness, the cleanliness and attention to detail is evident. All staff were so friendly and helpful, we had a beautiful and immaculate room, the food in the bar and dinner in the main restaurant was excellent and breakfast on both mornings was second to none. The hotel is so peaceful and quiet, yet it's in a great location, there's an excellent bus service with a stop close by, we even walked to Grafton St one day to work off the hearty breakfast. Thank you to all at Herbert Park Hotel for a memorable weekend.",5,2022,09,14
213,Well located for Dublin events,"Room great, reception staff excellent on arrival and departure. Lobby & bar lacking any character or warmth. Obviously Dublin pricing does not represent value for money but this is good place to stay overall.",4,2022,09,14
213,Terrific experience in Dublin,"The Herbert Park Hotel, away from the hustle and bustle of City Centre, was an ideal property for our visit to Dublin. Every aspect of the hotel was perfection -- the entire space, rooms included, was immaculate; the staff could not have been more friendly or helpful; morning breakfasts were delicious; and while the location was wonderfully peaceful, access to the more active parts of the city was quite easy. I'll definitely be booking here again on our next visit. ",5,2022,09,12
213,Quality hotel in a good location.,"The stay was booked primarily because of it location to a business event I was attending. My stay was comfortable, clean and easy. Staff friendly, my room was good and the food was really good including breakfast.",5,2022,09,12

213,Beautiful hotel in wonderful location,The Herbert Park Hotel is an excellent hotel in a great location! The adjacent park is very pretty and nice to walk around. There’s an interesting farmer’s market there on Sundays they includes different types of food trucks. The breakfast was terrific and the dining room is lovely - it looks out in the park. I would definitely stay at this hotel again!,5,2022,09,10
213,The Herbert Park is so wonderful I almost want to keep it a secret...,"...but that would be such a loss for all my traveling friends!

We recently stayed at Herbert Park Hotel for three weeks from late June through mid-July. We had a wonderful time at the hotel. Our daughter and grandchildren joined us for a week and they had a grand time as well. We would be remiss not to share more about our experience at The Herbert Park Hotel and Residences, and sing the praises of the Herbert Park team. Several team members especially Rommel (Assistant General Manager) and Said, as well as Siva and his friendly smile welcoming us to breakfast each morning, all made our stay extraordinary. 

From our arrival on the first day when Rommel extended us his gracious hospitality making certain we had refreshments after a long day of travel delays while we waited for our room to be ready, to assisting with a rental car disaster, Rommel was always at the ready with a smile. He greeted our grandchildren like a long lost uncle, and saw to our every need. 

One evening, when we were having trouble with an electronic item, Said came to assist and swiftly resolved the matter. However, he noticed I had a slight cough, and a few minutes later reappeared knocking at our door with hot tea, ginger, lemon and honey. I was so surprised and delighted to chat for just a few moments with Said and experience his enormous, generous spirit and warm-heartedness. 

I also wish I could recall the name of the waiter in the restaurant - who always seemed to know what we needed before we could even ask!

Often it's the little things that make a travel experience special. On this holiday, the Herbert Park team going the extra mile made us feel like we had found home! It's always nice meeting new people and sharing life experiences - we feel like we have new friends. 

Technical aspects: rooms are modern, clean, and splendidly quiet. Everything we had to eat and drink in the restaurant was delicious - I highly recommend the salmon. But then again, I ate salmon in some form at just about every meal. The full Irish breakfast is a glorious way to start the day.

The hotel is adjacent to Herbert Park, a lovely walking park with a weekend morning market in season. There are several restaraunts very close by and a Spar for incidentals across the street. The hotel is 1.5 - 2.0 miles (approximately 2.5 - 3 km) walk to St. Stephen's Green and Graften Street. 

I truly wish we could have sat down with these folks for family dinner - perhaps one day we will!

Important Note:  Bookings made through Booking.com may not include breakfast.  That is quite a loss!",5,2022,09,10
213,Outstanding,"An outstanding hotel in a superb and quiet location. Friendly and knowledgeable staff. The food was excellent both in quality and value for money. The transport links to the city centre and airport or port are good, but it is also possible to walk to the city centre.",5,2022,09,10
213,2night B and B,Stayed for 2 nights including breakfast. Check in was fast and efficient. Room very comfortable. Breakfast excellent and food in bar very tasty. All staff were very friendly and helpful. Fantastic location beside Herbert Park. Have been here in more occasions and never fails to deliver. Highly recommend this hotel. ,5,2022,09,08
213,Disappointed this time...,"This is my 6th or 7th time staying at this hotel, the rooms and location are excellent. Always a feeling of safety and comfort around this location.

This time unfortunately our stay was completely let down by the staff in the hotel, check in was seamless in fairness however the young man checking me in was efficient, that's about the most pleasant thing I can say about him. Upon trying to order a taxi the next morning we were told to stay around reception which we duly did for 45minutes without even an acknowledgment from reception we were still waiting, there was a group of American tourists who seemed to be let down by their lift into town, this seemed to be much more important issue to look after, I hate to say this but the front desk staff made me feel like a second class citizen in my own country. We eventually stood in the rain and hailed our own taxi making us late for our appointment.",3,2022,09,07
213,Dublin Family Trip,"I stay at this hotel every time I am in Dublin, at least once a year. It's such a friendly hotel with a great large meeting/sitting area in the lobby to meet friends and family. The rooms are clean and bright, and I love the atmosphere. It's a great hub for a Dublin trip, right beside the Herbert Park, a 30 minute stroll to the city, or take the commuter train (DART), and restaurants and bars all around.  
The staff are fantastic, special thanks to Rupa at the front desk, and Louise in reservations. I'll be back.",5,2022,09,06
213,Overnighter,"A perfect base for our girls catch up. Great cafes and food within walking distance and gorgeous nearby park to blow for the cobwebs and walk off the indulgences next day. Decent hotel bar to begin or end your night or spend some chatting comfortably. Busy car park with tight spots, moderately priced. Would definitely return.",4,2022,09,06
213,Amazing experience,"I absolutely  recommend this hotel, the rooms were very comfortable, clean and fancy, even the view to the park is stunning. The food in general was amazing and the service as well, staff in general is very kind (specially Roberto).
100% recommended!",5,2022,09,05
213,Great stay in Dublin!,"We had a lovely two night stay - we booked the summer offer and enjoyed the complimentary prosecco and parking. Convenient location and easily navigated from Belfast. Room was lovely, but my only comment would be that I found the bed and pillows quite hard - personal preference maybe! Staff were extremely friendly and breakfast delicious! Thank you :)",5,2022,09,04
213,An excellent stay,"Smart location, off Centre yet close enough to walk it, friendly services, spacious rooms, plenty of parking, business and leisure combination, in an area of very high quality of living, next to the park, safe…………that is where we would stay again.",5,2022,09,03
213,Excellent night stay,"I stayed at this hotel while in a brief trip. Great night sleep, great facilities (including tea and coffee machine) at a more than reasonable price considering the high season. The hotel is embedded in a large park, ideal for families",5,2022,09,02

213,Mr,"This hotel is amazing, the staff went above and beyond to make my stay awesome. I had many questions about Dublin and cabs to catch for appointments and I left clothing behind which the staff promptly located for me

213,5 star,We took advantage of a really good deal. One night in an executive room with bed and breakfast and free parking for under £160. A bottle of Prosecco was cooling in an ice bucket as part of the deal also. The room was spotless and the breakfast was excellent. Add to this the friendly and efficient staff and you have all you’d want for an overnight stay,5,2022,08,31
213,Great stay at Herbert Park,"Had a lovely time at Herbert Park hotel last week. The hotel is located in a central, but also quite peaceful area of the city.

213,Irish charm at its best!,"If there is one thing you can fall in love over and over again is the Irish people, they charm, politeness and definitely their mannerism. 
So a bit about the Hotel 

Location 9/10
This hotel is located in Ballsbridge. A quint neighbourhood with loads and loads of restaurants pubs convenient stores nearby with tons of good options and a crowd of smiley faces. 
It’s about a good 15 mins away from city centre but you can always get a bus. 

Hotel exterior and lobby 10/10
It’s within an actual park with a lake!! Need I say more??
Beautiful and green. Quiet in the night. Modern looking setup. Urban charm. 

Food 10/10 (Room service)
Managed to try their room service food was excellent. Sadly didn’t get a chance to dine in their restaurants. 

Staff 10/10
I think the Irish can’t help it, they are just the nicest people you’ll meet or live there long enough you adopt that charm. 3 of the staff that stood out the most for me was Viktor, John and Rupa, Warm and welcoming and above all they are very knowledgeable, they guide you as well as they can. They offer excellent suggestions. No room request is impossible for them. Simply love the team they have here. 
They are simply put as full of life. 

Room 10/10. 
Clean, urban and cozy. They give you an international adapter for your needs ready in the room. Even the coffee machine is a good proper machine. Beds are nice and comfy, medium hardness. Just nice for a good nights sleep. No noise or thumps in the night. 

Overall, if you are in Dublin, this is the place to be. 

Added suggestions
Try the Bridge pub and Roly’s cafe by the hotel. Amazing stuff.",5,2022,08,25

My husband told Said we had paid to stay in the hotel and we would sit where we wanted.
The lights were then turned on very brightly and Said began to hoover.

Someone needs to retrain Said in customer relations because clearly he missed the last class.",4,2022,07,29
213,Dublin hotels cashing in on events outside hotel,"Stayed for one night at Herbert Park to attend Aviva for the Ireland Vs Ukraine game in June. Booked in early May at £166.31 for one night. It's really bad that Dublin hotels are now putting up their prices that now exceed those of New York & higher than most European cities. People will not go back back and find alternative cities if feeling that they are being ripped off. I had intended to go to the second game against Scotland but could not find any where else that didn't want over £200 for one night for a single room. I'm not blaming just Herbert Park, but the Dublin tourist board for not getting to grips with prices in Dublin. 
I was advised at reception that I had been offered a better room than booked, but after passing the suites on the floor discovered that it was a poor view room no better than I had booked in the past at this hotel, and definitely not an upgrade.",4,2022,07,28

213,Terrible night manager,The manager thought that I was not a resident when I asked for another room key and took it upon himself to follow me to my room. I showed the man the proper identification and he associated me with another guest that was slamming doors.,3,2022,07,10
213,"Good service , room, and location","Recommended for stay, close to the park and easy to go to downtown, nice service, nice staffs, clean, quite, good quality of breakfast, Wi-Fi easy to access.

213,We'll be back,"Stayed at The Herbert Park Hotel on the 7th July and this hotel is our first choice for an overnight stay in Dublin. You always receive a warm welcome at reception and the whole experience is very professional. Our room (executive) was lovely, especially the bathroom. The hotel's location is excellent and you are only about ten minutes from the city centre by taxi. We look forward to returning very soon. ",5,2022,07,10
213,"Wonderful place, staff very friendly","I stayed there for a work event recently and it exceeded expectations, Mario from reception was particularly friendly and helpful. The check in was great, it was advertised as 3pm onwards but they had my room ready in the morning, so that was really helpful for my trip. I hope I get a chance to stay there again shortly!",5,2022,07,09
213,Great Hotel Great price,"Hotel was  A classic, clean & comfortable  hotel,centrally located.

We were unaware of their existence before then, but would highly recommend them to anyone traveling to Dublin in future.",5,2022,07,07
213,Great hotel,"I was part of a tour group, Collette Tours. Our hotels were selected for us. Out of all of the hotels we stayed in throughout our 16 days trip, Herbert Park Hotel was the nicest.

213,"great location, nice staff","Great location with good onsite restaurant. Staff very helpful, particularly  Ms Irani at reception was very helpful. The rooms are very good. It will be helpful to have some information about hotel in the room for guests to familiarise themselves with hotel facilities and surrounds. TV remote did not work and requires replacement batteries. It wasn't clear wether the rooms were self serviced. Great ambience.",4,2022,07,06
213,Great Stay,"I stayed at the Hotel as part of a business trip and was pleasantly surprised by the comfort, service and the location. There is a beautiful park (Herbert Park) behind the hotel. 
Only thing to notice it was really difficult to get a Taxi at peak times, which seems to be an overall issue in Dublin. ",5,2022,07,04
213,Great hotel and location,"Everything was easy and efficient. From the parking to the bedroom, a very easy and welcoming approach. Staff are professional and friendly.  The room was pristine. Great coffee machine.  The bed was ultra comfortable.  Great location, will definitely use again ",5,2022,07,03
213,Good room but basic stuff that are available during stay in a hotel were missing,"Good room but basic stuff that are available during stay in a hotel were missing:
for example:
1) Rooms do not have an iron and ironing board.(provided swiftly though when i called the reception) but this deafeats the purpose of saving time when you have business meetings early in the morning.
2) Bath ropes were not provided in the room , missing washroom slippers, unlike other cheaper hotels.
3) The Bath is poorly designed(water obstructing glass missing) , with just a curtain to stop the shower water from spilling on the washroom floor(doesn't do its job), the washroomfloor was like a swimming pool after a shower in this bath.
4) Asked for a bottle of water during checkout and wasn't provided one. Had to purchase a bottled still water for 6 euros. Least you can do is provide a bottle of water to your guests during checkout.
5) Positive feedback...Food was really good and service at the restaurant excellent.
Receptionists were really helpful , some do their job well.

213,"Beautiful hotel, great price",We had an issue with another booking and found the Herbert Park Hotel while trying to make other arrangements. The staff was quick to accommodate us. The hotel is beautiful. The rooms are spacious and well-equipped. It's in a beautiful neighborhood just a short drive from Dublin city center and the airport. Wish we could've stayed longer!,5,2022,06,30
213,"Wonderful Stay, will come again!","From the moment we checked in Irani looked after us so well.

The bedrooms are very clean and the bedlinen ensures a comfortable night's sleep which is a 'must' in my view. Breakfast is excellent and on this occasion as on previous visits my wife & I had dinner in the Restaurant where the standard of cuisine was top class. Nearby taxi ranks provide access to any part of the City desired on your stay and the lounge offers a relaxing space to unwind in the evening in spacious and comfortable seating. I suppose the only ""complaint"" I have is that I am yet to be disappointed. Looking forward to a quick return stay. Thank you for guaranteeing an enjoyable stay for value.",5,2022,06,29

213,Nice hotel and staff,"We originally had a hotel room reserved but when we arrived early from our transatlantic flight our room was not ready so they offered us a room in the residence at a reduced rate so we took it. It was nice to have the extra space. It had a microwave, coffee maker, kettle and washer/dryer. Lots of closet space. The breakfast buffet in the morning was plentiful and had lots of variety. The only down side is the lobby restaurant does not serve food after 10:00   There is however limited room service. The restaurants around the hotel all stop serving food at 10:00. Not sure if this is COVID related or not. Overall would recommend.",4,2022,06,27
213,Another brilliant stay at this First Class Herbert Park Hotel,"Just returned from another brill weekend stay at Herbert Park

213,Excellent for Sporting Teams,"Quality service and personnel were friendly and always available to assist with requests. The rooms were spacious and adequate for our stay.

This might be my 7th time in Herbert Park Hotel. I regularly travel to Dublin for work and nearly always stay in the Herbert Park Hotel - beautiful garden for morning runs/walks, walking distance from city & grand canal docks, clean/spacious rooms and friendly professional staff. A special shoutout to Irani from the reception, she is warm, welcoming and will go the extra mile to help you out each time (which is what keeps bring me back here). 

One request to management - you are often used as an business hotel. Please proper irons in each room, often during events we are running around for irons.",5,2022,06,21

213,Still my Dublin home!,I have been staying regularly again at the Herbert Park after the enforced Covid related absence.   There aren't many hotels that have that homely feeling but the Herbert Park has it.   Thanks as always to all the staff at the hotel but Irani at the front office deserves a mention this time for always helping sort out the occasional niggle.,5,2022,06,15

Location is great, close to restaurants and many places of interest.

Our room was spacious and very comfortable. The staff were very efficient and helpful. Breakfast was excellent and in a lovely dining  room overlooking Herbert Park. The locattion is excellent. close to restaurants, transport links and places of interest.
Our only problem was actually finding the hotel entrance, as the website doesn't mention that it is in Anglesey Road.

Our room was spacious and very comfortable. The staff were very effici

213,Herbert Park Hotel Dublin,This was a very pleasant hotel wth helpful staff. It was well located close to shops and restaurants. The rooms were bright and cheerful. I don’t really know what else to say..The bathtubs we’re just a little high for an old woman.,5,2022,06,07
213,Great hote,"Great hotel.  Irani on the front desk is an amazing host!   Always welcomed with a smile.   Good facilities and service throughout the hotel. Would highly recommend, no complaints.

Food and service in the bar and room service is also excellent.",5,2022,06,07
213,overpriced for the value,"paid the room 450 euro per night - got the room next to the AC for the entire hotel, so it was noisy
did I say that was 450 without breakfast..? oh yes..and btw-there was no hot water in the shower
disaster",2,2022,06,06
213,Noisy room doors slammed. Not a restful place to stay.,Excellent breakfast. The room was spacious but the bed was terrible. It was like sleeping on a gritty place mat. Very hard. The staff was courteous and attentive. The tub was very difficult to get in.  It was dangerous for seniors. The shower curtain didn’t stop water from going on the floor.,3,2022,06,05
213,Great staff,"We have stayed at this hotel many times. 
This time, not just as good an experience as the other occasions. 
Very warm welcome from staff. However, in the bedroom, remote control didn’t work on v poorly positioned TV, Nespresso machine leaked all over the dressing table when you switched it on, only one small body wash provided for two people, shower curtain over bath which clings to the person when the shower is operational and there was  no dressing gown provided. 
Staff v helpful with replacement TV remote and providing dressing gowns.
Breakfast was a disappointment. No berries at all despite them being in season. Porridge was completely inedible, like wallpaper paste. You make your own toast, self serve your own fry. Everything was v overdone.. hard and crispy bacon, shrivelled sausages.  The orange juice was a highlight. This hotel always prided itself on providing an amazing breakfast…. 
We booked a taxi for our return to the train. Staff could not have been more helpful when the taxi didn’t arrive. The staff is the jewel in this hotel’s crown but room checks need to be done in advance of visitors staying and the breakfast returned to its former glory.",3,2022,06,04
213,The most welcoming guest relations,"The hotel in general is lovely and situated in a great location particularly for getting to matches in Energia via a lovely walk across the park. However by far what makes this hotel stand out is the staff, and in particular Irani. She makes you feel special as a guest and has a beautiful way about her that comes across as authentic. She is also one of the few people in the various hotels we’ve stayed with who addresses me directly rather than making the assumption that my male partner is the person who is part of the overall group. These are the things that make a difference and why I can’t recommend this hotel enough.",5,2022,06,03
213,Amazing staff and Early Check-in,We flew from Ohio in the USA to Dublin arriving at the hotel early morning.  We thought we'd have to leave our luggage there and walk around until time to check in BUT were so happy and surprised that they had our rooms ready for us!  We were there for three nights and really enjoyed the breakfast each morning.  They had a great selection and the staff were very good at making us feel welcome and well cared for.,5,2022,06,03

213,Herbert Park Hotel,"My stay at the Herbert Park Hotel was simply impeccable from start to finish.
Angelika at the reception was top notch when it came to checking in, as I was a bit flustered when I got there.
Her very personable & calming nature, reassured us very quickly.
I will definitely return and I'm already telling my friends about my stay there.

5 star rating all the way!!!",5,2022,05,30

213,A very beautiful and comforting space to stay in Dublin,"My sister and I from United States were at the hotel for 6 nights. Everything about the space was wonderful. The staff was were very friendly and interesting to talk to. The food at breakfast was fresh and well made. We loved the openness of the room and first floor. Huge windows, comfortable couches to relax downstairs, not to mention the gorgeous Park right behind the Hotel. I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone visiting Dublin!",5,2022,05,30
213,Amazing,Had amaing night here with friends from work. We booked there amazing outdoor terrace with a lovley selction of finger food.

213,Nice room and good breakfast,"Good hotel not far from city centre in nice area.  Good breakfast and friendly staff.  I have heard complaints that the leisure facilities are limited, but I haven't used them myself.  Unnfortunately last visit noisy work on building opposite started early in the morning which was disruptive for some guests, but was probably out of the control of the hotel.",4,2022,05,30

213,Good hotel - wonderful location,The Herbert Park Hotel was in a very convenient location - about a half hour walk straight into Dublin or easily traveled on the Dublin bus. The staff was very helpful to us in getting around and finding good places to eat. A variety of pubs in the area and a lovely park at the site. The rooms were comfortable - we would have slept better if not for the time change.,5,2022,05,30
213,Lovely hotel,"I spent three nights at this lovely hotel. The staff were wonderful. So friendly and accommodating. The breakfast buffet was outstanding. One of the best I have ever had. 
I only gave it four stars because the housekeeping staff were lacking. Had to ask for clean towels, toilet paper and clean cups and then they didn’t remove the dirty towels or cups. Also had to ask for the garbage to be emptied. However once we made our request to the front desk it was immediately addressed.",4,2022,05,29
213,Stay for Dublin Wizard Con 2022,"The hotel is located right next to the RDS and that is why we chose it. We were volunteers at Dublin Wizard Con and needed to be close to the RDS. I would probably stay there again for the next Wizard Con as it is so convenient for the RDS, and we need to be close and to get a good night's sleep. I would definitely pre-book the breakfast next time as there is a saving. The staff were extremely helpful and the check-in and check-out was quick and easy.",4,2022,05,29
213,I will definitely come back here!,"Omg, the hotel is amazing. Lucija convinced me to move to a studio room with an incredible view over a beautiful park which made my experience outstanding.
Lucija and her colleagues were nice enough to give me recommendations on places to see in Dublin which were all very nice",5,2022,05,26
213,Reception,"I want to commend Irani, Rupa and Weija at reception. The three ladies had ready smiles for whom ever approached the reception desk., they had great communication skills and addressed all my requests immediately. Being the entry point to the hotel, I trust management will take note as they have a profound impact on the success of the hotel",4,2022,05,26
213,Wonderful place to stay!,"We were only there for one night, but it was a perfectly comfortable place to stay. The check in process could have been prepared for a little bit better, but overall, a very good experience. I would stay here again!",5,2022,05,25
213,You get what you expect from a four-Star Hotel / Price.,"Staff is nice and helpful, Room are comfortable and the area is both animated (pubs/restaurants) yet quiet. No issue with night time disturbance in the hotel either. Overall positive experience. You get what you expect from a four-Star Hotel / Price.",5,2022,05,24
213,Excellent but some disappointments,Hotel is in great location and is very modern and clean. Has restaurant and bar as expected. However found the bed uncomfortable and the shower pressure to be weak and temp to change very min or so. Staff friendly and helpful with the exception of check out which was rushed and impersonal ,3,2022,05,24
213,Great hotel great location,"Located by Herbert Park - lovely hotel views - hotel staff very helpful and friendly. Sadly no pool of gym facilities. 

Hotel room clean and plenty of space. Very high bath that would not be suitable for the elderly. ",5,2022,05,21
213,Very pricey for an Average Stay,"Location is great if attending RDS or Aviva, just a short walk to both. The reception and bar area are very modern and well serviced. The bedrooms are quite dated, and the view from my expensive room looked at a tall area of concrete and some more bedrooms. Bed was very hard and not comfortable. Drinks at the bar were at a premium price, yet no service attached so had to go each time for drinks yourself even though staff did not appear to be busy. I won’t be back, will take my business elsewhere where I can get better value and where I feel it is appreciated. ",3,2022,05,21
213,Dirty overpriced hotel,I typically stay at the intercontinental which is fabulous. Unfortunately it was booked which is why I instead stayed at the Herbert Park (because of location). I can’t say a good thing about the hotel. It’s disgusting. An overpriced and dirty hotel. My “white” shower curtain was black. There were brown spots throughout the blue rug in my room.  Management is welcome to reach out to me if you’d like to see pictures. ,1,2022,05,20
213,Nice Stay in Ballsbridge,"My recent business trip and stay at the Herbert Park Hotel was excellent in all ways. From an accommodative check in process (I was too early after my flight from the States for my room to be ready but Irani at the front desk worked hard to find me an available apartment at no extra charge) to an always clean and well-kept property, my stay the Herbert Park Hotel was great. It is a big hotel so it definitely lacks a bit of the Irish ""charm"" you would find at a boutique property, but for work or just wanting to stay in Ballsbridge, the Herbert Park Hotel is great.",4,2022,05,17
213,Fantastic Service!,"Stayed here for 4 nights 20- 24 April. 3 x Rooms booked for family- all were very happy with room size/ standard. Daniela did a fantastic job cleaning our rooms. All staff were courteous and helpful, in particular Irani - Guest relations Executive- who couldn't do enough for us- Thanks again Irani, you were brilliant! Some nice places nearby to eat/ drink, however we spent most of our time in city centre, of which was buzzing with excitement! We used taxi's only so not sure about public transport suitability, however we did see plenty of 'double deckers' passing by. Would definitely stay in this lovely hotel in the future.",5,2022,05,17
213,Herbert Park Hotel,"I was recently confined to the Herbert Park Hotel for 10 days because I contracted Covid while on tour in Ireland. The staff were very supportive during a difficult time.

213,"Friendly, professional service & high standards","We loved our stay at the Herbert Park Hotel. The staff were very helpful & created a welcoming energy. The rooms were very clean & services were very attentive. The food was delicious, we opted to eat in a few nights it was so good & reasonably priced too. Wish we had stayed longer to try more of the menu. The breakfast was excellent, we couldn't compliment them enough. Even though there was a slight technical error with our payment. We were a bit concerned of the price, as Ballsbridge is an expensive area itself, however eating out, local transport & the hotel were all very good value in consideration of its location, which was perfect for us. Our trip was both business & pleasure. The gym, although small, has a good amount of machines & equipment. Having the park right next door is wonderful though, for a run, outdoor gym stations, relaxing or taking a stroll. 
We would definately stay again & really enjoyed our visit. Would recommend going to Rolys restaurant near by & also Pacinos if you are going to the town center. Excellent food & establishments. 
Irani was very helpful when it came to us checking out & all the staff at the hotel were very much appreciated. Thank you.",5,2022,05,16

213,Hospitality!,"The hotel location is very convenient to my conference site. And there are pretty good choices for restaurants and bars just across the street or within walking distance. If my conference site is around this location next time, I will definitely choose this hotel again!

213,Wondeful staff who went out of their way to help,I stayed for one night in a signiture suite at the Hebert Park.  Truly a 5 star experience but the best part for me were the wonderful staff.

I cannot say enough about their kindness.,5,2022,05,08
213,5 star service,"I stayed for two nights in a signature room. It has a separate bath and shower, which is convenient. The bathroom and room were more spacious than expected, and my room had a dual aspect. There is a plugin for USB ports and all your gadgets.  The service of the staff was immaculate, polite and professional. I also met Rommel, the manager, who was very welcoming and excellent in hospitality.  The location is really beautiful, just beside the park.  The breakfast selection is good with strong coffee if you wish, plus the view of the park. I appreciate the tranquilness of the hotel and area and the professional attitude without flow. I will be back. Heartily recommend. Erik",5,2022,05,08

213,Outstanding Customer Service,"My wife and I checked in to the Herbert Park Hotel on April 21st and checked out the morning of April 24th.  Obviously the hotel is located in a beautiful and effective location with many amenities that many other guests have shared with their review.

My review will focus on the excellent professionalism and customer service of Mr. Tom O'Brien who works as a  building housekeeping service person.  Mr. O'Brien was very generous with his time to provide me with a cup of coffee at 4:30 am one morning when my wife was sleeping and I did not want to wake her up in the hotel room early that  morning.  He was very thoughtful and considerate to provide me with that service above and beyond my expectations.  He also did the same thing the next day. I was also impressed with the detail of his cleaning the hotel lobby, obviously he takes pride in his work.   On the last day of our stay I lost my prescription eye glasses...guess who found them and brought them to me personally...yes Mr. Tom O'Brien.  Hotel associates of many companies of this caliber are hard to find and retain, I trust that the hotel management of Herbert Park Hotel will take the time to recognize  his contribution to the reputation of your hotel.  It was an honor to provide this recognition to an outstanding and respected employee of your hotel.  Thanks, Eric Oster.",5,2022,05,04

She was very friendly, knowledgeable and helpful. My room was spotlessly clean and couldnt be faulted. Location of the hotel is great too in the heart of Ballsbridge with plenty of pubs and restaurants to choose from.

213,Outstanding,"Could not have been better. Tiny criticism, you should invest some money in the bar and make it a real destination bar. It's a little anonymous. That would make you the perfect hotel and give you terrific identity. ",5,2022,04,19

213,Great location,Great location and very pleasant staff. Food in the bar/lounge was good and cold buffet at breakfast was good. Unfortunately I’m not a fan of precooked hot buffet as they are often disappointing and this was no different. Other than that I enjoyed my stay and would stay again. ,5,2022,04,08
213,Weekend stay,"Stayed in the hotel for two nights, this was my second time staying at the hotel and as before, service was excellent, very happy with breakfast and dinner menus, good location and overall a great experience.",5,2022,04,07
213,Amazing Service,"I have travelled extensively for work and rarely do I come across a hotel colleague who provides truly above and beyond service.  That said, Rupa at the Hebert hotel has done that in more ways than one.  Our group meeting was missing vital printing (our fault)  which Rupa along with her colleague managed to take care of all the printing for us in a timely and effecient manner and honestly save the workshop!  Plus for me personally I was ill and she not only arranged a doctor visit, but also insured I had transportation and followed up when I got back to make sure I had a kettle in my room! Wow.   I feel truly grateful and appreciative of all of her efforts and will indeed use this example in my future service training workshops and tell this story to all. Rupa is the perfect example of how amazing customer service really does create lasting memories for the guest. Thank you so very much!",5,2022,04,05

From the second i check in to the second i check out, I feel like I'm home and had never in all those years left disappointed.

What makes the hotel one of the best in my eyes is the staff and how they treat their guests.",5,2022,04,05

213,Excellence customer service and location,"Very comfortable room with many special touches such as in room Nespresso, bathrobes and bottles of water.  Great location in a park and walking distance to Dublin city center.

213,Outstanding,"Recently visited them Herbert Park Hotel, truly had an outstanding experience. The quality of service from every single staff member was exceptional, professional, warm and welcoming. I’m sorry we didn’t get the names of some of the evening staff, because they truly deserved a mention, but at the breakfast service, Eugenia and Roger were excellent.

Great lobby…breakfast and Herbert Park to stroll in
This will be our go to hotel from now !",5,2022,04,02
213,Seamless Stay,"The hotel was clean and stylish and perfectly located for exploring areas around St. Stephen's Green, Grafton Street and Trinity College. Parking was also easy, which was a concern for our first visit to the city. But what made our experience even more enjoyable was the staff at the front desk who were all especially attentive to our questions. We would like to give some special thanks to Iona, who helped us plot our walks from the hotel on a map when we arrived, and made helpful suggestions about how to ride the bus and sights to see and nearby restaurants. Iona also helped us schedule a Covid test before our departure. It was a pleasure to be greeted by such a helpful, friendly person, who eased our arrival and departure. The other staff members we interacted with were similarly helpful and professional. Thank you again Iona!  Kris and Michelle",5,2022,04,01
213,"Modern, delicious breakfast and comfortable","I stayed at this hotel for a business trip. The facilities are modern and the rooms are very spacious. The breakfast was my favourite part as they provide good quality food.  The staff was also very kind, especially the ones at the restaurant for breakfast. 

I stayed over a couple of more days for holidays and the guest relations executive Irani Kosgoda was able to offer me a much better rate than I would have gotten from the site. 

The location is about 30 minutes walk from downtown which is nothing for me as I am used to walking a lot in London.",4,2022,04,01
213,Overnight Stay,"We had a family event and booked the hotel as its location was convenient. We asked for an early book in time and this was no problem. We got a lovely room, well appointed and spotlessly clean. The check in staff could not have been more helpful. We had booked breakfast and the next morning were delighted with the service, choice of hot and cold food and ambience of the room. One issue is parking which is on a first come basis, its located under the hotel and has limited capacity, also the car spaces are very narrow which can result in an interesting exercise in exiting or entering your car.",4,2022,04,01
213,What a Great Hotel,"What a great hotel!   They say that the people in Ireland are so friendly.  Well it starts when you arrive at the Herbert Park Hotel.  When I originally made my reservation from afar, I worked with Viktoria who couldn't have been more helpful.  Everything she promised came true in the end.  Then there was that very warm welcome at Reception when we first arrived.  It was Irani's smile and helpful advice that made our visit go as well as it did.   After 4 nights at the hotel, we had to leave for the weekend because of a prior commitment.  However after 2 nights away from the Herbert Park Hotel, we had no choice but to return to the accommodation that made us feel so much at home.  So if you're looking for a hotel in Dublin, this is the place to stay.  Also must mention that the location near the American Embassy just 10 minutes by bus from the center of town, is just perfect.",5,2022,04,01
213,"Don't Skip the Breakfast, it's Great!","Hotel buffet breakfasts are never something I usualy expect to be good but Herbert Park's was exceptionally tasty. We loved the amount of choice you had and the fact that the quantity of choice didn't affect the standard. 
My partner made a full Irish (with perfectly cooked scrambled eggs as he said) and I made a plate of pancakes, streaky bacon and maple syrup. The pour-your-own banana starwberry smoothy was also delicious.
We left really full and really happy!",4,2022,03,31
213,First Class facility & service at the most strategic  location,"As most of business people in Asia, due to Covid, we been delaying our biz trip month after month. Dublin turned out to be the first city I visit in more than 2 years. When I arrived at Herbert Park Residence, Ms. Rupa immediately put me at ease, she is of great help for my plan in Dublin. My 4 stays there was so wonderful. Ya, I have to mention Ms. Lucija from Croatia too, her service level is also of Ritz Carlton standard. Bravo to Herbert Park, Thank you Rupa & Lucija!",5,2022,03,31
213,Dublin Visit,"We were visiting Dublin as my wife was meeting old Montessori College friends. We booked the Herbert Park Hotel as its in a lovely location in Ballsbridge and beside the lovely Herbert Park. We got a reasonable deal for the nights stay.

The hotel has a lovely foyer, bright and open. Our room was very comfortable and had a very nice Nespresso Coffee Machine. The bed was comfortable too.

But main reason for doing this review is the wonderfully friendly staff member we met at reception, Irani. What a fantastic receptionist. So engaging, friendly, caring compassionate and efficient. The loveliest receptionist we have met in many many years of travelling, possibly the best ever. Irani is from Sri Lanka and the Herbert Park Hotel are most fortunate to have this young lady as one of their receptionists. The other receptionist, whose name we do not have, was also most helpful and friendly. We have always felt that the real enjoyment of our stays at any hotel over 40 year’s of travelling depend on the quality of the staff. Irani would make us return to the Herbert Park.",5,2022,03,31
213,Short stay,Both Rupa and Iriana at the reception desk were so welcoming on our arrival. We were having a family gathering and the lounge staff were so facilitating and professional. We look forward to our next visit. ,5,2022,03,30

213,Relaxing short stay,"We had a most enjoyable and relaxing overnight stay in a beautiful room on the third floor. The room was beautifully bright and really comfortable. We found staff in the restaurant and particularly Rupa at reception very welcoming and most helpful.

We had a 3 course dinner in the restaurant which was lovely, the fillet steak was top class!(and I'm fussy)the breakfast was also packed with lots of food to be had and really enjoyed it. We would highly recommend this Hotel. The location is perfect for a city stroll, the Aviva stadium, RDS or simply a meander round the Herbert Park which is just outside the entrance of the Hotel, we visited the Park for the Sunday market stalls and enjoyed some treats. The hotel is ideal for all travelers and we will be back for sure!",5,2022,03,27

Room is comfy and has all you need to relax.",5,2022,03,27
213,Pre Rugby Lunch,"I had a wonderful experience at the pre match lunch for the Ireland v Scotland game.

The staff at the front desk was friendly and efficient, inquiring about flight into Ireland, where we are visiting from and we were offered a welcome drink of Irish Wiskey!  The room was clean and comfortable.  The breakfast on site was amazing!  Offering a huge selection of incredible Irish treats.  We loved being in the heart of Dublin, an easy walk downtown, to restaurants and pubs, experienced local music and was convenient to an amazing bus public transit system.  An absolute pleasure!  Thank you.",5,2022,03,24
213,Very comfortable and friendly,"We stayed before and after holiday flights ad had the spring deal for both stays. We were very impressed by the hotel and its staff. Irani and Andor were particularly helpful and friendly. Our only minor dislike was the Prosecco, which was a bit sweet but since it was included in the package it's a very small detail. We've given The Herbert Park our vote for the best hotel in Leinster",5,2022,03,23

213,Fantastic Stay with Incredible Service,"We were fortunate enough to spent ten days at the Herbert Park Hotel and it was an amazing experience. The location is perfectly situated right on the edge of the beautiful Herbert Park in Ballsbridge which provided the ideal setting for a brisk walk after a delicious breakfast. The hotel is within walking distance to a number of delicious restaurants and gastropubs, such as Rolys, Lobster Pot or the Bridge. The room was bright and well appointed with comfortable beds and beautiful details. A gym, on-site restaurant, bar…. I can go on and on, but what sets the Herbert Park apart is the staff! Every question and request was met with an immediate and cheerful response.  It would be unfair to single out any one member as everyone from house keeping to the GM helped make with our stay incredible. I am so impressed with the friendliness and professionalism of the HPH team!

Room was completely spotless and very comfortable.

We enjoyed a quick drink in the bar before heading out and the service was excellent and friendly. 

Any requests we made at reception were handled quickly and this was the same at check out when it was as effortless as check in.

The area the hotel is in is also fantastic with a few great bars and restaurants literally across the road. 

Taxis into the city centre cost about €10 - €12 but there seemed to be regular bus services on the main road closest to the hotel.

Without doubt a brilliant experience and this is the only hotel I'll be looking to book when visiting Dublin from now on. ",5,2022,02,16
213,A great experience,"We travelled to Dublin with a newborn, whoever did that knows that the travel time and logistics can take a toll on the parents and baby.

The evening meal was excellent and I can highly rate this Hotel for both business and leasure travellers.",5,2022,02,07
213,Great location for aviva stadium ,"We stayed here due to the close proximity to the aviva stadium.
Parking is first come first served and is not guaranteed.
we luckily found a very tight spot in the underground that my husband manged to squeeze our jeep into.
We were quiet shocked to find that parking was not free for residents.
On check in We were upgraded to one of the park residents apartments.
Great room and has everything you could possibly need.
I like to strip the bed and clean the room before we leave any hotel and leave everything in the bathroom.
While stripping the bed I noticed old slippers and tissues under the bed, obviously missed from the previous guest.
We ate in the restaurant as we weren't aware you could order and eat in the lobby.
On game days the lobby is full of supporters either residents or not and seating is limited.
Great hotel when going to a game but not sure I'd pay the price range again.
Room and parking was €277 without breakfast which was approx €20.50 each.
Our 3 course meal for 2 with wine was a decent price of €135.00 and our young waitress was amazing.",5,2022,02,06
213,Superb lunch,"A friend and I enjoyed a superb lunch in the Restaurant of the Hotel on Saturday 29 January 2022. Everything was excellent - food, staff, ambience, and value.

213,Lovely luxurious hotel in the middle of it all,"I inadvertently found myself stuck in Dublin having missed a flight and needing US Embassy assistance.  The Embassy is minutes away from the Herbert Park Hotel.  It was a serendipitous stranding because despite the expensive area, the room rate was not jaw dropping, and the friendly staff couldn't have been nicer or more helpful, particularly Andor and Irani on the front desk.",5,2022,01,28
213,Mary Sharpe,"Really enjoyed my stay in this hotel. Spotlessly clean With friendly and courteous staff,I particularly want to praise Irani on reception. She was so friendly and welcoming, and at 10 am told me my room was ready and gave me my key card. Breakfast was buffet style, everything was fresh and tasty, I would appreciate it if someone could adjust the toaster so it would toast the bread ( why do so many hotels have this problem?) I also enjoyed dinner in the hotel and went completely ‘ retro’ and ordered Prawn cocktail followed by Duck Confit with green lentils and vegetables. Delicious. One of our party ordered the cheese plate -a very generous portion arrived and so I was obliged to help out!I the caramelised walnuts were really good.

213,One or two night overstay,Herbert Park Hotel is an excellent hotel that is ideal for one to two night stay in Dublin. Location first class with most amenities within walking distance. Parking is ideal and on most visits I am happy to leave my car parked up and walk or get a Taxi. Herbert Park ticks all the boxes and is reasonably priced mid week. Can be expensive when Dublin is hosting a major event but this seems to be the norm across the board.,4,2022,01,17
213,Another Lovely Stay,"Was only staying for one night unfortunately. As usual everything was top notch. We were checked in by a nice gentleman who was very polite and helpful. We had lunch and dinner at the hotel, the quality of food was delicious and could not be faulted. The staff were very friendly and polite. Breakfast was also a very pleasant experience.

The staff are lovely; Rani looked after us so well. The room had amazing views of the city and was spotlessly clean with a gorgeous bathroom. It was so quiet and the bed was very comfortable. Even the decor contributed to a very relaxed, comfortable night's sleep.  Dinner was great, served in the restaurant which has a chilled atmosphere and a view of the park which you can enjoy at breakfast. Breakfast offers a wide choice and is a lovely start to the day.

213,Quiet covid Christmas,"We stayed 6 nights in a little Park View apartment. We had originally booked a Courtyard view but changed rooms to a park view, which was much better. Courtyard view overlooks a brownfield site. Park view looks over the lovely park.

We received a lovely Irish welcome with mince pies and mulled wine. Also complimentary welcome bottle of wine, chocolates, coffees and teas in our room. The staff were really friendly and helpful.

The room had pretty much everything we needed, a little kitchen all very well equipped for two people. Microwave, kettle, hobb, pans, dishwasher, washing/drying machine. There is no oven. 

The bed was a bit small, maybe 5ft (150cm) approx. Not king size. 

Some apartment rooms have showers and some have baths. 

Teenage sons said the gym was good.

It was nice to be able to open the sliding window but the protective glass wall felt quite low and a bit scary for tall people. I wouldn’t feel happy with it open if I had small kids.

This was a very nice clean modern good standard four star hotel.",5,2022,01,01

Special thanks to Irani Kosgoda, Guest Relations, and her colleague for facilitating my arrival and checkout. A small error on my charge was quickly rectified before I checked out.  I would highly recommend this Hotel for its personable staff and their willingness to do everything they could to make my stay as enjoyable as it was.",5,2021,12,26

213,Herbert park,"Room key stopped working
Staff didn’t fix at first attempt
Dinner stopped at 9 not 9.15 as staff had said so we missed dinner. 
Breakfast not included, 21.50 pp very expensive for poor quality food. 
Parking 24€ for us as a couple from 8pm to 8am. 
Ok departure reception staff overly familiar and insistent on trying free food/wine. Ignored complaint of hidden costs of breakfast/parking. Insisted we email directly next time for enquiry on bookings - even though “price will not change” so I didn’t understand reason for that. ",2,2021,12,24
213,Herbert Park Hotel experience,"It has been a nice experience, very good service. Breakfast with everything I liked (at the hotel I did not have another kind of meal apart from breakfast). Every morning I took a walk at Herbert Park garden, a very nice park.",4,2021,12,24
213,Family friendly hotel in an excellent location,"From start to finish our stay couldn’t have gone better. Every staff member was friendly and helpful, the rooms were clean and spacious, and the beds were super comfy.

213,"Calm, peaceful, and so friendly!","Hi 

I spend 24 hours at the Herbert Park in Dec 2021 - as negative pandemic news broke by the hour - it was a haven of calm, an oasis of peace and the staff were unbelievably helpful and friendly. The main lobby is a perfect place to relax with family or friends, (I recommend the soup on a cold winters midday!), the view from the bedroom out over Herbert Park was stunning, and the staff on both check-in and checkout could not have been more helpful. And all conveniently located in the heart of Ballsbridge, within walking distance of town if you want. 

This was my first visit... I'll be back! (And did I mention the breakfast - top notch!)

213,Lots of noise,"Lots of noise during the night. Hotel empty but they still fill in rooms close to the noisy elevator.
Avoid this hotel if you wish to sleep. Probably good for people having a party in the vicinity but certainly not for business.",1,2021,12,16
213,Amazing Place to Call Home for a Couple Weeks!,"This place is amazing. Centrally located and close to everything. The food is outstanding in the restaurant and room service. The staff is very friendly and helpful and always there to answer questions.

213,Hotel,"Beautiful hotel with professional and courteous staff. 
Food and drink quite expensive and some of the rooms a little tired in appearance for the price for a one night bed and breakfast and sometimes breakfast not included in price. 
Nice serene ambience in restaurant and dining lobby
Excellent location",4,2021,12,09
213,"We enjoyed staying here with storm barra. It was clean, warm and comfortable","We found the staff here fabulous (apart from one but who cares about one bad one, we didn’t bat an eyelid at his  poor attitude)

Check in was friendly and professional, the man on the desk is great and consistently good over our four days. 

Upstairs we are on the third floor looking over the park at the back and it’s clean, warm and a comfortable room.

Breakfast is great and worth adding. Again superior service and it was always friendly and nice to come downstairs to. 

Housekeeping staff are great and the place seems very clean and secure, following the rules to the letter. Good to see

We really enjoyed being back at the hotel. The parking offer on some of their deals is very good value and worth it if you are bringing the car. 

We’ve stayed here a few times, and were glad to be back.",5,2021,12,09
213,Excellent service,"We had a wonderfull stay at Herbert Parc Residence. 
Our apartment had a superb view on the parc. Plenty of space and light. I would definitely book an apartment with a parc view , the apartments on the other side of the building have a view on a small court and the office building on the other side of the court is very close.
Very good breakfast buffet , restaurant, bar and in room dining. But above all excellent service. 
Special mention to Nick from the restaurant , everybody from the in room dining service and the lady who came immediatelly when we had a problem with the nespresso machine. 
We also loved the location of the hotel , next to the parc and RDS, walking distance from Sandymoiunt beach , Dart Station and Grand Canal . 
I highly recommend Herbert Parc Residence. ",5,2021,12,08
213,Excellent Family Christmas get together,"Thank you Iosif, Delia and Angelica for an excellent (adult) family meal and overnight stay. Restaurant food was tasty (you could taste each element distinctly) really nice house wine and great relaxed service. Having the park (with Sunday market) next door was a bonus.  Pint of Guinness needs work, but I'm being picky. ",5,2021,12,07
213,Excellent hotel,"Really excellent hotel. Great location, friendly and helpful staff, really comfy and large rooms, decent price, great food and drinks, and finally, a really amazing selection at breakfast. We will be coming back for sure! ",5,2021,12,07

213,Great location in a lovely hotel,"We have stayed in the Herbert Park before and did not hesitate to book it again.  We needed a hotel with car parking so this hotel is top of the list. On arrival the staff are very friendly and efficient. The rooms are comfortable, clean and spacious. The bar area is bright and the breakfast is one of the best i have had in a hotel.",5,2021,12,02
213,Just a one night stay but will be back,"Had a spontaneous one night stay here last weekend after getting off a flight.
Can't fault this hotel.  The room was large and spacious with blackout curtains.  Wifi, good shower pressure and even some Butlers Chocolates left in the room too.  What's not to like?

The foyer is especially impressive.  It was decorated for Christmas with a stunning Christmas tree and toy soldiers lined up outside the lift.  The foyer alone makes this hotel worth a visit.

Breakfast was fantastic too with a great selection to choose from.

One tiny piece of advice:  tell the breakfast staff to ease up on swiping plates, bowls away the second guests put them down.  It became quite intrusive as the service went on.  I felt at times that they were hovering over us waiting for us to put something down.  Granted, it was a quiet morning and there were a lot of staff on so I guess they were trying to keep busy but perhaps they can find something else to do.",5,2021,12,02
213,The Best Hotel in Dublin,"I have stayed at the Herbert Park Hotel several times, and frankly I do not plan to stay at any other hotels in Dublin. The staff here are so friendly, our rooms are always clean with lots of natural light, great location basically in Herbert Park, and a nice breakfast each morning.

Herbert Park is a independent hotel, which is great because the employees here seem to really be proud of the hotel, and they have more autonomy to make your stay right.

Looking forward to seeing them again the next time we are in Dublin!",5,2021,12,01
213,Herbert Park,"Excellent hotel in great location, staff were top class and I had a delightful stay. Good value for money and I couldn’t recommend it more. The food was excellent but the staff were the main selling point they were superb",5,2021,12,01
213,Excellent hotel,We had a great 6 night stay at the Herbert park. We had two rooms with a door between them which was perfect for a couple and two teenagers. The breakfast buffet was super convenient and tasty. Parking was also convenient and the Park has a wonderful trail for walking and is right outside the door.,4,2021,11,30
213,Great start to our trip!,"Stayed at the hotel for 2 nights during a tour and it was an amazing start to our trip! It was great they had a room for us ready at 10 am! The staff was so kind and knowledgeable about the area and made great recommendations. Breakfast was delicious! If you can get breakfast do it, everything from the eggs to the smoothies was delicious! The hotel was also close/fair walking distance to other things in the city! I highly recommend staying here the room was clean and comfy, the staff was wonderful, the dining was delicious, you can't go wrong!",5,2021,11,29
213,Perfect ❤️,Perfect location best part of Dublin very easy going staff nice food .will stay again very clean . Breakfast is very good 😋 very easy access to city centre . Will definitely stay again and highly recommend this place all staff are very welcoming ,5,2021,11,28

They accommodated every request with a smile and  made sure that we had everything we needed, The hotel is beautiful, the rooms clean and very comfortable. All staff were just wonderful. I would definitely stay again.",5,2021,11,28
213,Restaurant Dining,We have eaten a number of times in the Herbert Park Hotel dining room over the past few weeks and the food has been wonderful but equally as important the staff have been particularly warm and welcoming - especially Iosif Ronan.,5,2021,11,27
213,Close to the RDS with Clean Rooms and Outstanding Food,"Clean rooms, outstanding food and friendly staff. Not much more to ask for in a hotel. I only stayed one night as our business was exhibiting at the RDS and the experience was very pleasant. I had the Salmon for dinner and it was exceptional. Breakfast was included with the room and was also excellent with a wide range for both meat eaters and vegetarians alike. The beds however are firm and as I am used to a memory foam mattress at home I did not find my sleep quality to be that great. I do not expect this to be a problem for most people as I may just be slightly spoilt in that respect. It was a hotel after all and I can not expect the same luxuries as my home. Overall I would say the entire experience was excellent.",4,2021,11,26
213,Excellent hotel,"We stayed here before a rugby match in the aviva. Couldn’t be more ideal for what we were looking for. Reasonable rates, gorgeous hotel and rooms. Staff were friendly and we were able to leave the car underground after we checked out to go to the match. Can’t fault it. ",5,2021,11,25
213,Great location,"The Herbert hotel is a special hotel in a great location. From the moment I drove up to the property, I knew I was in for a treat. The views from the property of the Herbert park were lovely. The customer service and hospitality were top notch. The location was ideal; a few minutes walk to a range of wonderful pubs & restaurants.I received tips from guest services about the best place for food and drinks. The general manager, Egle and Irani on the front desk were  especially courteous and generous. The Herbert park hotel is very clean and serves a great  breakfast, I felt i got value for my Aussie  dollar.  I'll be back  again ,thank you for a memorial stay.",5,2021,11,25
213,Overnight stay 18 November,"What a great hotel, spotless, spacious with a terrific array of food and drinks. Apart from location and the aforementioned what this hotel great is the staff. A particular note to Iranzi who goes out of her way to offer a warm welcome and to ensure that you have a great experience. Love the place",5,2021,11,23
213,Very loud Air Conditioning/Climate Control System,Very poor sleeping achieved due to the very loud Air Conditioning/Climate Control System which had no apparent way to turn it off. Removing room card in power enabler did not solve the problem as system just restarted itself accompanied by a loud clicking noise so we had to power the very loud system up again. We had two rooms for the family and both had the same issue. Unfortunately this is the second time we have experienced the same issue at this hotel in the last couple of years. The first time this happened hotel maintenance failed to get the system turned off or disabled and we were given another room but the process was so laborious we couldn't be bothered this time. On booking online this time we wrongly assumed the issue would have been fixed as we can't possibly have been the only people to have been impacted by this issue in recent years. We will not make a similar wrong assumption again.,3,2021,11,23
213,Another excellent stay at the Herbert Park Hotel,"We've stayed here many times previously, and yet again we were delighted! Even though it was a very busy weekend at the hotel (rugby match),the service and quality was of the highest order. Particular thanks to Irina at reception,her friendly and warm chat was most enjoyable!",5,2021,11,21
213,Wonderful hotel,"Great staff, location and style. Simple and elegant and welcoming. Always courteous, generous, friendly and helpful, the staff are especially nice at this gem. The location near embassies and the river is great. Herbert Park itself is also very nice. The restaurant is top notch and simple.",5,2021,11,21
213,Highly recommended hotel,"We stayed for one night as I was attending an event in the Aviva stadium. The location was great, lots of nice eating places nearby in a plush area of Dublin, foreign embassy land! The staff were so lovely and polite, the room was large and spacious and well appointed. However two things they need to sort out: get rid of shower curtains, awful dated things and install a socket / USB charging at the beside tables. There seem to be a complete lack of sockets and use of double adaptors / trailing leads. 
We had a lovely view from the room over Herbert Park and breakfast was superb.  Carpark facilities were excellent also. ",5,2021,11,20
213,It’s all about the location….,"We booked this hotel as we had tickets for the rugby at the Aviva Stadium although not the cheapest of rooms, the location won the day. On arrival we were offered a drink, a shot of whiskey or Baileys which was very welcome! We were advised to leave our car parked where we had left it, right outside receptIon which turned out to be very good advice. Our room as actually a small apartment in the Park Residency, which was as affordable as a room. It was very well equipped with all that you’d expect, even a washing machine! However….although modern and stylish we found the accommodation to be soulless. It was decorated in greys and browns and not a drop of any other colour. It was crying out for some vibrant artwork to lift the cave like atmosphere. Lighting was a bit ‘all or nothing’.
There were some practical issues too such as not enough surface in the bathroom for wash bags or makeup, not enough hanging space for wet towels and other than inside the wardrobe, no mirrors, so drying your hair for example, you have to either look through the glasses on the shelf above the coffee machine or be engulfed by the wardrobe doors. Minor but frustrating. 
We had room service on the first night which was excellent, the food was very good and hot and it took no time to arrive at our door. 
Due to the rugby and the hotel hosting a corporate function the hotel was very busy but the staff remained courteous & helpful.  
Overall all we had a good experience at the Herbert Hotel and we would stay again, with a few minor considerations it would be very good or even excellent. 
Ian & Siobhan ",4,2021,11,18
213,Weekend in Dublin,Great location. Friendly welcoming staff. Clean and comfortable. We have stayed several times and always try the Herbert Park as our first choice of accommodation in Dublin. Book early to avoid disappointment. ,5,2021,11,18
213,"Lovely location & lovely, friendly staff","This was a great location for exploring the area on foot. I especially liked that a rugby match was being played at the stadium a few blocks away. While I'm not a sports fan, I did enjoy talking with people on the street after the match & watching them celebrate over drinks in the hotel after the game. The staff were consistently very friendly & helpful. The food & drink service were top notch.",5,2021,11,17
213,a very pleasant stay indeed,"It was a hugely busy weekend on account of the All Blacks match.  That said, I found all of the staff that I encountered both friendly and professional to a fault - often in very demanding and busy circumstances.  ",5,2021,11,16

213,A great base for a visit to Dublin,"We stayed here on the weekend of the Ireland vs New Zealand Rugby International. The hotel upgraded us to a room with a park view and there was a lovely bottle of red wine and chocolates waiting for us when we arrived. Our room was comfortable, with a lovely big bed and a great view of the park. 
This hotel is a fantastic base for exploring Dublin and was ideal for us as we were going to the match. 
We only ate breakfast at the hotel but it was delicious and there was a great selection of food available.
The best part of our stay were the staff who were so friendly and helpful they really do deserve a special mention. It must be very hard working in the hospitality industry right now but you would never know it by looking at the staff of The Herbert Park Hotel.",5,2021,11,16
213,Short Stay,"Excellent facilities and staff , only problem was the sat nav took me to the wrong door. Staff were friendly and the rooms were spotless. Breakfast was really nice.
Car park spaces are quite tight in the underground",5,2021,11,15
213,Excellent Hotel,"I stayed for four nights and from start to finish I was very happy with the Herbert Park  Hotel. No problem parking my car and a warm welcome on my arrival.
My room was large and spacious lovely comfortable bed and an excellent shower in the bathroom.
The breakfast every morning was excellent with great choices and the food in the evening in the bar was also top quality.
Finally and not least the staff were excellent in the bar, restaurant  and especially I want to give a mention to Rupa & Irani who were very helpful..",5,2021,11,11
213,Good location but only very average experience,"Great location but the hotel is only very average. The rooms while clean had low quality beds, pillows and quilts and this really impacted my sleep. I genuinely expected a lot more from a hotel of this price. Additionally, the common areas and gym are badly in need of a total revamp. In summary, it is a great location but the hotel is average across the board at best.",3,2021,11,10
213,Fantastic Hotel-Irani a real Gem,"I have frequently visited the hotel for lunch. It was amazing. Irani  couldn't be more  helpful, real Gem - Herbert park Hotel lucky to have a person of her  calibre. Also Thank you Nives.

213,Marie Ryan,"When my husband and I visit Dublin, Herbert Park is a firm favourite for us. From checking in, to the bedrooms with their beautiful snow white bed linen. We love the view out to Herbert Park, where we take regular walks. The lounge is pretty and relaxing for some food or a glass of wine or both. Overall we always enjoy our stay at this gorgeous hotel. I would totally recommend it.",4,2021,11,09
213,"Warm, Inviting, and Excellent Service","I visited Dublin from America for the first time and immediately felt safe and welcome. I was greeted warmly by Irani at reception and knew I was in the right place. The check in process was smooth. I then enjoyed a full Irish breakfast at the bistro before settling in. My room was bright, clean, and spacious. I received excellent service from everyone I encountered, from Siva in the bistro to Egla the GM. The location was phenomenal, right in the heart of all the action, but quiet and secure. I will no doubt return to the Herbert Park Hotel when I visit Dublin again.",5,2021,11,09

From check in to check out the reception staff were utterly charming! They cared so much about us having a most memorable occasion and we certainly had that! I can wholeheartedly thank the staff and indeed the management while organising our stay - Egle, Joanna and Amy were such a pleasure to deal with. I look forward to staying again! ",5,2021,11,06

The concierge met with our group and explained our accommodations, we celebrated with a welcome toast and were issued our room passes. Dining was very good and breakfasts as well.

All the staff were friendly and very helpful.
Room service was great and available quickly throughout the day or night. Table service in the restaurant or lobby area was fast efficient and orderly, staff couldnt be more helpful.
I recommend the hotel for families with kids as there are lots of places and activities close by or within a short taxi ride.",5,2021,10,28

213,View of brick wall,"Stayed in Studio Apatment with Sofa Bed.
Room was clean and large. Very nice room.
Very disappointed that we were in a basement apartment with a view of a brick wall.
I feel this should be mentioned at time of booking.  On the bright side it was quiet.
Matress was firm/hard.
Bathtub was very tall which made it difficult to get into and out of.
Staff were very polite and helpful.
Hint:  Order your own taxi",4,2021,10,27

213,Perfect for a night to attend The Ideal Home Show,"First time using the hotel. Ideally located near the RDS. Got a delightful room overlooking Herbert Park where you can take a stroll.

They welcomed us and provided us with helpful and important information to make our stay the best! I would highly recommend them for your visit to Dublin!",5,2021,10,25
213,Valued member of staff,Our stay in the Herbert Park was enhanced by Irani who was working at the front desk.We needed a taxi promptly and when it was proving very diificult to order one Irani used her personal taxi app to secure one for us. By doing so she ensured that we were punctual for a family get together. Irani's attention to detail is excellent. She is a great asset to the hotel.,5,2021,10,25
213,Excellent Staff,We spent the weekend at Herbert Park Hotel and from the moment of check in through to check out we were very well looked after. Irani at reception was very helpful to give us all the information we needed throughout our stay and even some very efficient follow up after we had left something behind. Hotel is in a great location with lots to explore on the doorstep.,5,2021,10,25

213,Welcome restored!,"From check-in to check-out, I couldn’t fault the customer service and the welcome! We were visiting the hotel for the first time in many years and were pleasantly surprised by the ambiance and the welcome. Our stay co-i coded with a rugby match in the Aviva - a short walk away. We were lucky enough to receive a complimentary upgrade; our room had everything we needed and the walk-in shower was such a treat! A special mention and shout out to Irani on the reception desk. With front-line staff of her calibre and attention to detail, the hotel is being superbly represented. Having a drink in the foyer was a relaxing experience as there was ample space and social distancing, while still being able to absorb the atmosphere. Very happy to recommend staying at the Herbert Park Hotel.",5,2021,10,25
213,Overnight stay,"Secure parking was beneath the hotel and allowed easy access to reception via a lift. Covid regulations were in place and well signed.

213,Expensive,"Beware if you book from booking.com, as they will allow for any changes to your booking, like upgrading to a different room, or changing the room spec. We were then chided for not being more careful booking the room we wanted.
Other than that, we had good experiences with the front desk/reception folks. We did not eat at the hotel as there are plenty of good places to eat very nearby. ",3,2021,10,23
213,Excellent stay in Herbert Park,This is a brilliant hotel in a brilliant location. Large comfortable rooms well appointed. Friendly staff and excellent common areas downstairs where you can meet friends and enjoy a drink or afternoon tea. Highly recommended.,5,2021,10,22
213,Birthday surprise stay,My daughter organised a surprise stay for my husband and I to celebrate my birthday. The staff were very helpful and worked eagerly with my daughter to arrange balloons and bubbles in the room. Additionally after we checked in they delivered a plate of small cakes which included a birthday wish and a card. On checkout I was asked if a had a good birthday and stay - very switched on and professional staff.  The room was also of a very good standard with a great view over the park.,5,2021,10,20
213,Recent stay at the Herbert Park Hotel,"Had an excellent stay at this hotel . Iriana at front desk was most helpful  and friendly with the arrangements .

Over all a very pleasant stay.

Tom & Julie O'Malley",5,2021,10,20
213,Lunch at the Herbert Park,"We had a family celebration lunch at the Herbert Park. The food was very good and the service of the team of Oisif, Nick and Delia was excellent.

213,A grumpy presence is a neighbor’s benefit ! (i.e. Rolly’s),"A hotel in line with the intended expectations, with friendly and professional staff. An advice for future clients: if you go to the bar, listen carefully and unconditionally obey to the orders of the maturest person in charge there who reminded me, as age and inflexibility the former Habsburg emperor Franz Josef who declared WWI! Being several family members at a table we asked him about the availability of a preferred meal of my twins grand sons. He conditioned his answer by asking us to move to another table, what we would have done if the meal would have had been available. He sticked to not answer before we move so, finally we moved to the Rolly’s restaurant in the neighborhood!",4,2021,10,07
213,Exeptional,"This was our first stay at the Herbert Park and the initial choice was its location.
The guestroom overlooking Ballsbridge was spectacular.
The overall service and friendliness in both Front Office and Lounge are to be commended.
Confratulations to Egle, General Manager and to,Irani, Rupa and the entire FO team!",5,2021,10,07

213,A great post-Covid return,The Herbert Park Hotel has a great location and is also an oasis of calm. The staff are all very welcoming and professional -  a special mention for Irani at Reception.  A room with a view over the park is a big treat. We look forward to our next visit to Dublin.,5,2021,10,06
213,Great to be back at the Herbert Park,"It's great to be back in my home from home when I'm in Dublin. Despite Covid restrictions my stay was enjoyable and restful. The downside of Covid regulations meant my bedroom was not freshened up each day - my Mum trained me well to make my own bed, but one of the treats of being away is having the bed dressed and the room freshened up each day. It did not take from my enjoyment at being back at the Herbert Park.",5,2021,10,05
213,Excellent mini break,"Location ideal, staff superb Room was spotless. We also availed of Room service and had dinner in the restaurant. We enjoyed all the food ,including breakfast immensely.

I enjoyed a quick visit to the market in the park on Sunday morning.",5,2021,10,05
213,Ms,"Just wanted to say what a lovely hotel this is and Rebecca the bar manager was absolutely lovely. Would definitely recommend this hotel, enjoyed it thoroughly. Fab location for a walk in Herbert park too.",5,2021,10,04
213,Great hotel,We stayed as a family of 5 in 2 rooms. They were really nice with a view of the park. Great coffee in the room. We had a few drinks in the lounge then dinner in the restaurant. Food was great and service was fantastic. Would definitely return. Great location too.,5,2021,10,04
213,"Great hotel, professionally run with an excellent staff","We recently stayed at Herbert Park Hotel for over one month because of house  renovations. We chose the hotel for its excellent location - beside Herbert Park in Ballsbridge - and its reputation for quality. We were not disappointed in any way during our stay. 

The recently renovated Signature King Rooms are spacious and well appointed with bright, modern bathrooms. The Park Residence Studios are ideal for those who wish to enjoy the facilities of a quality 4 star hotel with the added benefit of self catering facilities. 

In our experience, this hotel differentiates itself from others in this price bracket by a really excellent staff in all departments of the hotel. We felt that we got to know some of them quite well during our stay and each team member was helpful, friendly and professional. From the management team (Egle & Joanna) down, they appear to be well trained despite several of them being only recently hired post Covid lockdown. 

Special mention goes to Nick in the restaurant, who always went above and beyond in providing first class service. Sarah, Ronan and Nives were all great too.  The bar and housekeeping staff were also very good (unfortunately some of their names now escape me). 

At Front Desk, Rupa, Kamile and Irani were always welcoming and attentive. You only had to ask once for something to be done and it would be - without delay. 

We would definitely stay here again and look forward to visiting for a meal soon. Herbert Park Hotel is also walking distance to several very good restaurants in the neighbourhood (Rolys, Mulberry Garden, Al Bocshetto, The Lobster Pot, Kites).",5,2021,10,03
213,Great service from Irani,"Delighted to see the Herbert Park getting back to business as the pandemic (hopefully) recedes.  Stayed there in September - comfortable room, early check-in, and great service, particularly from Irani on front desk.",5,2021,10,03
213,Wonderful,"The Herbert Park Hotel is a perfectly appointed hotel with attentive staff, spacious rooms a fine restaurant and bar it is located alongside Herbert Park and the high end residential area of Ballbridge. Numerous pubs and fine dining are just steps away",5,2021,10,02
213,fathers and sons,This was a long awaited trip for my best friend and his son to spend a weekend in Dublin with me and my son. Herbert Park Hotel was an ideal location in Ballsbridge and proved to be the best 5* hotel with incredible staff and friendliness. I can't recommend this hotel higher.,5,2021,10,01
213,Fabulous weekend,Thankyou so much to Egle and all her team @ Herbert park Hotel for making our weekend special! Our room was stunning with views all our Dublin !

213,5 day stay,"Nice spacious rooms. Comfortable beds and good in room facilities in the apartment suites. 

Gym is small with no window/ natural light and one of very few machines was not working. 

My room was ground floor with outdoor balcony area but you couldn’t access it as it’s blocked by a glass panel which is unfortunate and seems unnecessary. 

It’s about 20/25 min walk to the centre.",3,2021,09,30
213,"Top class staff, excellent location and comfortable room. ","Fantastic stay in this centrally located hotel. The staff were friendly and attentive from check in to check out, particularly those at the front desk!  The room was spotless and the bed was so comfortable.

213,Lovely hotel,"Great room (upgrade), lovely staff. Breakfast was disappointing, no homemade bread and the fruit salad was v poor. It used to be wonderful. All Covid-related I assume. Otherwise fab hotel. Staff are excellent.",5,2021,09,25
213,Nice 2 day staycation,"We had a 2 night stay for our 25th silver anniversary. We were on a staycation special so we got a room upgrade overlooking the beautiful Herbert Park. 
The hotel was very clean, the staff very polite and pleasant. Breakfast was decent and atypical for a four star hotel.
Big shout out to a wonderful lady on the front desk, Rapu - she really made us welcome when we arrived and also went out of her way and asked us how our stay was and wished us well when we were leaving.
The hotel is close to the embassies and to the Aviva stadium. It is about a 30min walk into Dublin City centre - taxis are around €10-€12 if you don’t fancy the walk.
Will stay again.",4,2021,09,23
213,Wonderful service,"Very nice hotel, great breakfast!  Staff is very friendly and helpful, especially Irani at the front desk and Rebecca in the restaurant.  I feel I made two new friends!  Breakfast buffet, eggs, bacon, cereal, etc.",5,2021,09,19
213,A must stay,"This wasn't our first visit to the Herbert Park Hotel and we will definitely be staying again.  The location is so central and in a beautiful area, with Herbert Park on the doorstep for a lovely stroll.  The city centre is within walking distance and beside the hotel there is a convenience store, chemist, pubs and restaurants. We stayed for4 nights, 2 adults and 2 teenagers in adjoining rooms.  The rooms were spacious and spotlessly clean.  At the time of our stay Covid restrictions were in place so we had breakfast in our room each morning and this was a nice treat.  We had dinner in the hotel 3 of the nights and the food was very nice and the staff very pleasant.  Irani and Rupa on reception were so helpful to us and we would like to thank them especially.  We look forward to our next stay.",5,2021,09,16
213,Great Hotel,"I always stay at the Herbert Park Hotel - it's in a great location with walking distance if the city centre- Ballsbridge itself is a very exclusive suburb with wonderful amenities- there are lovely high quality cafes and restaurants to choose from in addition to the hotel restaurant which serves great food also - the rooms at the Herbert Park Hotel are very clean and many have views over the park which is very beautiful and right beside the hotel - Irani and Rupa at reception were most welcoming, friendly and helpful as indeed were all the staff- I can't recommend this hotel highly enough",5,2021,09,13
213,Great Customer Service,Perfect Stay!  Irani on reception upgraded us to an executive room which was a lovely surprise. She was very helpful and attentive as were all the staff. Extremely clean and great food. Would definately stay here again.,5,2021,09,12
213,Great experience! Will Stay At Herbert Park Hotel Again.,"We traveled to Dublin to drop off our daughter at University College Dublin (UCD). The hotel staff was friendly and very helpful. The room was very clean. The restaurant food was delicious. The neighborhood is safe and the park setting was really terrific. We walked in the park each day. This will be our ""go-to"" place to stay on our next trip back to Dublin.",5,2021,09,12
213,My Home Base in Dublin,"I've stayed at the Herbert Park Hotel several times now. The staff couldn't be lovelier, and very professional as well. Every request I've made has been handled immediately and with a smile. The rooms are spacious, and incredibly quiet. The mattresses, duvets and pillows are comfortable, which I don't usually find with hotels. I really appreciate having air conditioning/heating in the room so I can choose what temperature I want. The breakfast is delicious, but the lunch and dinner food isn't anything to write home about. It's lovely having the park right next to the hotel if you'd like to go for a stroll. The most convenient hotel to stay at if you're going to the US Embassy. It's also a nice walk or quick bus ride into central Dublin, yet far enough away to have a lovely, relaxed feel to the neighborhood with lots of restaurants and shops. Parking (with a daily charge)",5,2021,09,12
213,Going home,"The perfect base for visiting Dublin, or in transit. The tranquility of a beautiful park, beside fine dining establishments - Roly's and the hotel dining room are just two.
Easy access to the city centre and all that Dublin has to offer.
Incredibly helpful staff.",5,2021,09,10
213,A Pleasant Hotel to Spend a couple of Nights,"The room and especially the bathroom were fantastic.
We were taking an early ferry and having a  parking space and a quick drive to the ferry was great!
But I want to compliment the reception staff and especially Irani who manged to move us to the room that she said was the best in the hotel.
All the reception staff were friendly and helpful.",5,2021,09,10
213,Service and quality makes this hotel stand out,Recently stayed at the Herbert Park Hotel and were impressed with the the friendliness of the staff as well as the cleanliness and quality of the rooms.

My daughter and her family reside within walking distance thus making this an ideal place to stay when visiting.",5,2021,09,09
213,Wonderful Hotel in a great location,We stayed at the Herbert Park Hotel for nearly two weeks. It’s a wonderful hotel full of very friendly and efficient staff. The food is perfect - well priced and yummy. Their fish and chips are honestly the best and I love fish and chips!! Don’t worry they have healthier options too like the superfood salad. It’s right beside Herbert Park and our room (one of the new addition rooms with a gorgeous bathroom) overlooked that oasis of calm in Ballsbridge. You could walk into the city center or hop on a bus. It’s just perfect base to explore Dublin.,5,2021,09,08
213,Wonderful staff,"We regularly lunch in the Herbert Park Hotel and it is always a pleasant experience.  One of my family is wheelchair bound and staff cannot be kinder or more courteous.

I especially want to call attention to Rebecca and Siva who were very attentive during our visits to the restaurant. We liked the comfortable and private seating on the outdoor patio.",5,2021,09,02
213,Great service,I went for a meal and coffee with my friend there and the service was great. The food and the coffee was delicious. Thanks Delia for all your attentions there were beyond my expectations. For sure we'll be back.,5,2021,09,02
213,Highly recommend Herbert park hotel,"Have stayed on two recent occasions in Herbert park & both have been fantastic. The hotel is in a central location and the underground parking is an added bonus. The hotel is clean & fresh with brilliant staff, particularly Irani at reception, she is so warm, friendly & accommodating and such an asset to the Herbert park hotel.

We particularly liked the Park and all of the amenities it had to offer. We would have liked to see some benches or seating outside the Hotel itself.,4,2021,09,01
213,The hotel in Herbert Park,What a fantastic location beside this wonderful park. Sunny days and even rainy days it is a calm haven to relax in. Whilst a visit to city may get you all fired up the location of the Herbert Park hotel is an amazing oasis to return to. But please don’t tell everyone! 😎,5,2021,08,29

We have been staying for many years and always can’t wait to go back .",5,2021,08,27
213,Excellent Customer Service,"We come to the Herbert Park hotel every year for our Dublin trip. With the addition of the Residences, we now have the freedom of an own kitchen area, living space and working desk.
The apartments are finished to a very high standard and when you have an issue, the staff is at hand with a quick and solution-oriented approach. 
Especially Rupa and Anton helped us when we had an issue with our luggage and needed a fast resolution. Also in the restaurant, you will be looked after by friendly and well-trained staff.

213,Better for business travel than romantic break,"We stayed in the Herbert Park for a night in August. The hotel was lovely & clean and check in was efficient & pleasant. We were given a nice room with a beautiful view of the park. It's definitely more a business hotel though, lack of ambiance in the lobby & restaurant which could easily be improved by some background music & a few candles. We didn't feel like lingering in any of the public spaces there. Food was on the whole quite good, despite being given out of date menus which meant my salad nicoise unexpectedly came with salmon (which I don't really like) despite menu saying tuna. Issue was eventually resolved though & staff were pleasant. ",4,2021,08,24
213,Comfortable hotel. Great location for our needs at RDS horse show. Great service.,"Hope to stay again in the future. Comfortable beds, quiet room, good air conditioning, good service. Nice food.

Our room was so lovely overlooking the RDS! It was so clean and fresh and kitted out with lovely coffee and water! I really had no issue at all with our stay, the location is amazing!",5,2021,08,23
213,Enjoyable Staycation ,"Arrived at hotel to be checked in by Rupi whom was so welcoming and professional. Our stay was just excellent and as other reviews here would suggest, their customer service is outstanding. Unfortunately, I can't remember everyone's names but in all departments! It's a credit to your hotel. Sarah in the foyer bar area was excellent while we had food on 2 occasions.. It made our stay that but special. The location of this hotel is beautiful right beside Herbert Park and Ballsbridge while close to the city also. 
The only fault I had was that the hot breakfast buffet was cold on all of our 3 mornings a little disappointing and poor selection of fresh breads but the service of the staff in the dining area made up for this. Would definitely stay again. ",5,2021,08,23
213,love this place,"Beautiful hotel and apartment/studio in Park Residence overlooking the gorgeous park . I have stayed a few times and its always without fault , bathrooms/shower is superb , the bed is cosy and clean and as the room overlooks the trees in the park it feels so spacious and bright during the day .

213,Amazing stay at an Amazing Hotel,"Just enjoyed a long weekend stay at HERBERT PARK HOTEL.

The stay was first class (as usual)

Received the usual warm welcome from Irani and Adam at reception and the checkin was a simple and smooth process.

Our 5th floor Parkview room was simply stunning and we would thoroughly recommend to anyone making a booking.

During our stay any requests or queries were dealt with in a very efficient manner and nothing was any problem.

Rupa made the checkout process flawless and hassle free!

The staff are doing an excellent job in very difficult circumstances and are complying with all the COVID restrictions with a minimum of fuss and with minimal effect to guests.

Egle and her team are doing a fantastic job at the Herbert Park and are a credit to the hospitality industry which is dealing with challenging times but hopefully we are all emerging towards normality and better times ahead!

So congratulations to all👍👍👍

Brilliant hotel in a beautiful setting ,what more could you ask for👍👍👍👍

Been going now for 20 odd years haven’t had a bad stay yet👍

Would thoroughly recommend you stay at Herbert Park if heading to Dublin!!!

Very friendly staff from start to finish, Irani greeted us, warm and friendly, nothing was too much for her to do to make our stay as comfortable as possible.  Due to Covid we had magnificent breakfasts delivered to our room each morning, whatever we chose and at our time.  Will definitely be back",5,2021,08,12
213,Comfortable stay at an exceptional hotel,I enjoy coming back to stay at Herbert park. The staff are wonderful and Irani is always pleasant at check in. They are helpful and insure I have a very comfortable stay every time I'm there. The rooms are kept to a exceptional standard and the food was delicious. When I am in Dublin I wouldn't choose any other hotel!,5,2021,08,11
213,Great to be back,Like visiting a dear friend when we arrived the welcome was prefect.During our stay  the service was exceptional but always delivered in a safe way. Before leaving we enjoyed a walk in Herbert Park to cap off a most prefect few days ,5,2021,08,11
213,Fabulous Hotel,"We have stayed in this hotel on a few occasions and we cannot recommend this fabulous hotel highly enough for so many reasons! Amazing location nestled in a beautiful park! Excellent accommodation.. rooms are very clean and comfortable. Delicious warm breakfast delivered to the room! Restaurant food is fabulous as is the service. However above all we are so impressed by the staff in this hotel. Irani and  Rupa ( Reception) are so welcoming, warm  and accommodating. Victoria ( Reservations ) is extremely helpful and looks after myself and my husband so well ! It will always be our first hotel of choice when visiting Dublin!",5,2021,08,10
213,Well managed quality hotel,"My wife and I came to Ireland on 6 weeks driving tour. We booked Herbart Park Residences, self-catering units, attached to the hotel. We were looking for a suitable place not far from Dublin ferry port for our first and last week’s stay. On arrival we were greeted by a very friendly receptionist, Irani.  Check in formalities were quick and we were given a set of key cards for our room, overlooking Herbert Park on the 5th floor. We found the fully air-conditioned room and the bathroom, was very neat, clean and well fitted and well maintained. There was a small electric induction cooker, Microwave oven, Dish Washer, Washing Machine, Expresso coffee machine and a Fridge. I was a bit surprised not seeing any facilities for ironing.  Cutlery and utensils were adequate for two of us. All appliances were of good quality and we noticed owners had given plenty of attention to detail. However, for a self-catering unit I felt they should have fitted a cooker hood to take the cooking smell and the fumes away. This was evident as the whole corridor was smelling on the first evening as someone had cooked fish in their room. There was a smart TV mounted on the wall and plenty of UK style flat 3 pin sockets to charge various gadgets. Bathroom had good quality amenities and fittings. The deep and full-sized bath tub also had a hand-held shower and a rain shower. On the first day we noticed the rain shower was not working and the ever so friendly manager, Mr.Rommel promptly arranged for it to be fixed. It turned out there was a blockage which was removed. Although the shower was working well I feel the pressure could be better. Another thing I noticed was the absence of a grab rail to help us get in and out of the deep tub. I noticed that one has to be very careful (especially if you are not very tall or young) not to slip, when you get out from the wet and slippery tub. I feel a grab rail can be fixed between the towel rail and the door frame to solve this issue. WiFi connection was good. I was told they have a fully fitted gym but didn’t get a chance to check it out.  This is a privately owned, modern and well managed hotel with 230 rooms built in 1996 and extended more recently. 50 or so Self-catering units are part of more recent addition. They have parking facilities in front of the hotel and also underground. There is a café and restaurant at ground level. Looking at the room service menu I was a bit disappointed as there ware not many options for Vegetarians or Vegans. During our stay we also came across Rupa and Kamil both very friendly and helpful staff at the reception. On the whole we were very happy with our stay and any criticism is only intended to be of help to the management. I will have no hesitation in recommending this place to any of my friends. We look forward to our return towards the end our tour.",5,2021,08,10
213,Excellent Stay,"After a bit of a hiccup on out last stay…our faith in Herbert Park has been restored! Thoroughly enjoyed our stay from start to finish. We were checked in by the most pleasant and efficient Irani. She also helped with some questions that we had later. Had a nice lunch in the bar where the staff were helpful and efficient.
Our room was lovely and we had a lovely relaxing stay. However, I do miss my breakfast in the dining room, not at all the same having it in the room. Booked in again on 22 August.",5,2021,08,10
213,Excellent,"We had a lovely experience in your hotel.  Look forward to returning in the very near future

213,Assumpta’s Birthday,"Finally back in The Herbert Park after an absence of 8 months. Felt like a visit to family that we haven’t seen in too long. We love this hotel. The service is 2nd to none and the location is ideal. Ballsbridge is a great area with the beautiful Herbert Park on the doorstep along with great restaurants and bars. 
What makes a visit to this hotel really special is the staff. It was great to again see Nieves, Sarah, Rupa and Irani. Lovely people who look after us very well. Thanks a lot. I’d recommend this hotel and area as a perfect location.",5,2021,08,06
213,It made our day!,"After having a negative experience in different hotel in Dublin we phoned Herbert Park Hotel last minute hoping to find a room there. We spoke to Irani who promised to give us a great room. Indeed, moving to Hebert Park Hotel was the best decision we made while in Dublin. 
It is a very clean and modern hotel in one of Dublin's best areas. Overall,  we had a great stay in Dublin, and Irani has the most courteous staff and we owe it it to her.",5,2021,08,05
213,All rooms do not have a view of the park!!,"Stayed here for one night in a family room. The room was very disappointing. The size and beds were perfect, however on reading and why I booked this hotel was the rooms were advertised as overlooking the park with large windows. Our room looked into a wall with air-conditioning unit buzzing all night long.

Dinner was good. Breakfast was a disaster, served in your bedroom, we were 3, with a tiny table plus food was lukewarm.",3,2021,08,04
213,Superb Dublin base,"Recommended by Dublin friend for 4 night visit and couldn’t have been happier with the experience. 
Stayed in one of the studio residences. Beautifully designed and prepared room. Very secure and quiet. Excellent Siemens appliances and attention to detail including detergent, washing capsules, soaps and shampoos ….
The location is perfect, far enough out of Dublin CBD to escape riffraff but close to many pubs, cafes, etc and of course the delightful Herbert Park, an absolute oasis of greenery, community space and charm. Felt very safe at all times and will definitely revisit. Shout out to the charming Irani who smoothed the check in/out process and made us feel genuinely at home.",4,2021,08,03
213,Lovely & quite and great location,"Had a lovely stay last week and we were taken care of by Irani who was super helpful and friendly. Lovely decor. Outside dinning. Had to have breakfast in our rooms which was a pity but a novelty at the same time. Lovely park views from our room too.

213,Excellent from the moment we arrived😊,"I couldn’t  be happier with the experience myself and my daughter had at the hotel. From check in with Irani everything was perfect and everyone was so friendly, helpful and welcoming (Egle, Ioana), We were in an executive room with the most stunning views of Herbert Park. The style and decor of the room was beautiful, and as for the free standing bathtub, it was so big I could have slept in it! The quality of food was also excellent and I loved that breakfast was served in the room, it made for a lovely start to the day. Thank you Herbert Park for a wonderful stay. We’ll be back!",5,2021,07,28

213,A midweek break,"The hotel was absolutely perfect for out 4 day stay. 
We wish Egle the newly appointed  General Nanager all the best. She is outstanding. We have admired her work ethic over the last number  years and it is lovely to see her being promoted. Vishcal at the restraunt was most helpful. He went out of his way to facilitate us. 
Herbert park is a wonderful hotel. I Highly recommend it. . ",5,2021,07,25
213,Herbert Park,"Had a super time staying at the Herbert Park Residence. Beautiful accommodation in fantastic location.
Staff are very friendly and helpful.
We opted for apartments as still had to have breakfast in room with current government restrictions. This was a good move. Apartments are beautiful, finished to a very high standard. They are very well equipped. Only thing we missed was a toaster.
It’s a lovely stroll into the city centre. The park next to the hotel is lovely to sit in and relax. Nice biz around the area.
We would definitely stay again.",5,2021,07,25

213,Recommend Highly,"Lovely rooms, great staff, new outdoor area for food overlooking the park that I really like. Great place to stay when I am in Dublin for business.

213,"Great hotel, excellent food, poorly trained staff","Amazing hotel, reception staff were lovely, bar staff were very badly trained and left us sitting outisde without taking our order for 30 minutes. Also maitre d' insisted on trying to sit dinner guests on top of each other despite being in a practically empty room and everyone asking for additional social distancing. The food however, was absolutely fantastic. The rooms were lovely. ",4,2021,07,23
213,City Staycation,After eighteen months of lockdown we had a glorious three nights in the Herbert park. We left the hotel feeling rejuvenated. Our king size bedroom overlooked the beautiful park.

213,3 week stay,"Excellent !     I stayed in the Park Residence . It was lovely , clean , spacious with a great view of the Park. It had everything I needed , with a great walk in shower .  The Housekeeping ladies were so nice and helpful . I had run out of Bottled water and coffee , I asked reception and it was with me in a few minutes . All the staff were great , only tiny little moan would be with a couple of the bar staff . On a couple of occasions I just fancied a quick drink on the terrace , just for half an hour . It was a bit of a drama the bar manager said you have 30 minutes which was fine , same again next time I tried and there wasn't a single person out there . Apart from that very small thing it was a great stay . Irani on reception was especially nice and kind . Would definitely stay again .",5,2021,07,20
213,Excellent,"Irani was superb and sorted everything for me. The hotel is wonderfully located, is very reasonable and can only be recimmended.

213,Fantastic hotel in a fantastic location  with fantastic and welcoming staff,"The greatest compliment that one can pay to any hotel or business is the fact that we return and stay at the hotel each time that we are in the area of the hotel.    In this case it’s the Herbert Park Hotel in Ballsbridge, not alone of its location but most importantly  the high standards at every level achieved by the management and staff.   
This time we booked the hotel with a very professional and efficient receptionist called Irani, when we arrived a receptionist that we had not seen before greeted us by name.   The hotel has what is a very effective covid protocol in place where we all felt safe and protected as much as possible - we had breakfast in the room.  The staff went to great lengths to ensure that we had everything that would be possible to have in their restaurant.   Then at checkout we were greeted and thanked once again for our stay by Irani, the very pleasant receptionist that made our booking.    Well done to The management and staff and thanks to Irani.",5,2021,07,18
213,Great hotel and break away to relax,"We thoroughly enjoyed our 2 night break away at The Herbert Park, receptionist (Rupa) was very welcoming as were all other staff we interacted with. The Hotel was very well presented and felt they had applied Covid precautions well for all. Our room was excellent, we had one evening meal in the hotel which was very good (lamb chops, yum), whilst breakfast was served in our  room and was of good quality we would have preferred to eat in the breakfast room area, I’m sure if the hotel looked into this and made some changes, staggering guest timing etc guests who wished to use this would be very happy. Otherwise we once again enjoyed our stay at The Herbert Perk Hotel and will be back again.",5,2021,07,18

Staff super friendly. Booking made over the phone. Reservation staff was very nice and accommodating. Thank you ,5,2021,07,18
213,Wonderful - Will Return.,"Wow - this is a great Hotel and receives 5 Star’s from us. It is ideal for families being on the edge of Herbert Park and other Dublin gardens, which has great kids play area, and is safe. Great also for walks along the beautiful Dodder River. The staff are amazing and super helpful. Egle in particular went above and beyond her duty call. We also sampled the dinner food here and were mightily pleased and satisfied. Breakfast was also great and obviously was not sitting in a food warmer and had been cooked fresh. The location is very central for shopping, Aviva Stadium, RDS, and great also if you are into Property Rubber necking.

This Hotel was very well Managed and very Clean and has a continental feel about it.
Being only a 25minute walk or 5 min taxi to Dublin City Centre it is very Handy to all the main Attractions and your Car will be safe and secure.

P.S. The Hotel was very well prepared for COVID-19 as there was lots of room to Social Distance which made us feel very Safe.",5,2021,07,14
213,5 Star Staycation,"We are just back from a tremendous stay at The Herbert Park Hotel. From the moment we arrived the professionalism and friendliness was A1.
Couldn't recommend this hotel enough-cleanliness/food/C19 protocols-the whole package. Too many brilliant staff from management to front desk/bar/cleaning to single out any one. Well done to all.Will return.
Derek + Deirdre (Cork)",5,2021,07,14

213,Patrick Counihan,"I cannot fault my stay but due to COVID factors & as per all hotels I travel to, the atmosphere of a busy hotel is lost (through no fault of your own)
A particular shout out to the dining staff who went out of their way to setup an outdoor park view arrangement for me.
Finally, scrambled eggs for breakfast were as good as the Shelbourne (& that's a very high standard)",4,2021,07,12
213,All fine,"Fine, I have stayed many times. Without people in the lobby it was less friendly though I assume this was to adhere to COVID rules. Not having a breakfast in cafeteria was also disappointing although breakfast across the road was a lot cheaper! ",5,2021,07,11
213,Anniversary break,A beautiful hotel in a lovely location.. We had a lovely clean bright room overlooking herbert Park... The hotel itself is beautifully decorated and very quiet we will definitely stay here again and next time we will book directly with the hotel ,5,2021,07,10
213,Great stay,Bar staff are wonderful great place for a drink. rooms are very comfortable compared with other nearby hotels. The outdoor area for eating is extremely pleasant when sunny. they could do with adding some sockets near the bed like almost every other hotel in the world. Whats that about.,5,2021,07,09
213,Another great stay,"Been to Herbert park hotel a few times now and it’s just great, from arrival , room, service, all great, the food is really nice , I recommend the lamb cutlets,, breakfast totally fantastic. The market was in the park last time we stayed worth a look.",5,2021,07,07

The hotel was so clean and our room was really comfortable and nicely decorated. The hotel was a comfortable walking distance for us from the city centre. There was ample parking on site.

Thank you to all the staff for making our stay so special. ",5,2021,07,05
213,Staycation,"Let me kick of by saying I really like the Herbert Park Hotel.Great location, super staff. It's our go to hotel when staying in Dublin. 
I do wish that they would push for a little bit more on the luxury front. Everything is just on the limit of what is absolutely necessary to achieve 4*, no more than that.They could do so much more at virtually little extra cost to lift this hotel beyond bare-bones 4* . Food is typical hotel standard, fine but no more than that. 
Key tip...bring your own hairdryer. I am reliably informed the one in the room is £ shop quality. ",4,2021,07,04

213,So glad to be back!,"Just had a lovely weekend back at the Herbert Park.  It’s been too long but was so glad to see familiar friendly faces.  The hotel is following COVID regulations and has sanitising stations around the premises.  We chose to check in on arrival (you can check in contactless at present) and everything was smooth as usual.  We had booked the Prosecco package which upgraded us to an Executive room with robes, slippers, Prosecco on both nights, chocolates and complimentary water.  Car parking is also included.  

Breakfast is served to the rooms at present, but very efficient friendly service.  Housekeeping serviced the room to the usual high standard.  

The Terrace lounge was very relaxing and we had lunch, drinks and dinner there and were looked after by John.  

So glad to see Eghle and enjoyed the chat and the craic with her.  We were telling her we were so glad to be back as the hotel always makes us feel so welcome.  The beautiful Herbert Park is on the hotels’  doorstep and lovely to walk around- the ducks are a joy to watch.

Would definitely recommend the Herbert Park Hotel.  It is a lovely walk into the city centre and nice to come back and enjoy the facilities that the hotel provides.",5,2021,06,28

We dined in the Terrace restaurant both evenings and the food was absolutely delicious.

213,Hit and Miss,"Recently visited the Herbert Park Hotel as a last minute booking for our wedding anniversary. 

Firstly, we booked the dearest room available as the pictures showed a balcony/terrace area. We were disappointed to find the doors from our room locked and we were advised we couldn’t open them due to health and safety. To be fair, the room description does not state terrace, it’s just visible in the pictures which is slightly misleading so we accepted this. We probably would have went for a cheaper room though had we known this. 

We headed down to the bar for a drink and some lunch. Great service from Siva. Very friendly and helpful. Food was great too. 

Hotel is in a great location in Ballsbridge and we headed out for a walk. 

We had dinner included in our package and were disappointed to find out the restaurant was closed and dinner would be served in the bar area. The tables/chairs/couches in this area and totally unsuitable for a meal. They are fine for a quick snack and lounging with a drink but not comfortable at all for a 3 course dinner.  The tables are way too low and seats not comfortable for eating at them.

We were also only advised at check in that breakfast was room service only - I don’t recall seeing this anywhere during the booking process. 

We had to check out early unexpectedly the next morning so we didn’t end up having breakfast but the lady at reception had an anniversary card written for us which I am assuming would have came with breakfast had we not checked out early - this was a lovely touch from the hotel. 

Lastly, at check out I was advised there was a balance outstanding from our stay. I queried what this was for as we paid the room in advance and settled all bar tabs etc.  The lady at reception did not have the detailed bill to hand but advised it was for drinks in the bar. As I was in a hurry to leave, I paid the balance of €87.50.
I received a receipt by email and replied to query what this balance was for, as I still did not know and it turns out it was a mistake and not a valid charge. It has since been refunded to by card but this would have slipped by had I not queried this a second time.

Well done staff and management you will see us again soon. ,5,2021,06,10
213,Great location,"Stayed over the weekend, room was spacious and spotlessly clean. Staff very friendly and helpful. Can't wait to stay again. Chose hotel for location and as it also had parking.

The reception staff were excellent both on arrival and departure.

213,Excellent hotel,"My husband and 2 children (7&5) stayed here for 2 nights on a family package.

We ended up eating in the hotel 2 nights, the menu and food was fantastic. Also,  The Guinness was just perfect. Very good and healthy children’s menu also. The rooms were spotless and spacious and the staff were more than helpful. Due to Covid breakfast was served to the rooms; no shortcuts taken with this and everything was delivered freshly and there was ample amounts of everything ordered.  The kids loved the ice cream bar in the hotel and the lady there was lovely. Well done Herbert Park Hotel.",5,2021,06,08

213,Great hotel in gorgeous location ,"My fiancée and I stayed here for 1 night and it was a most memorable stay. We booked the Staycation special which was very good value and on arrival we were warmly greeted by the receptionist Ionna. She was very welcoming and courteous and once we arrived at our room, which was an upgrade as per the package, our bottle or prosecco was on ice and the room itself was perfect. It was spacious, clean and overlooking Herbert Park itself, couldn't ask for more. 

We had dinner booked for 8pm and once we arrived we were given the option to wait outside in the terrace for a pre dinner drink. The outdoor terraced area was lovely, clean and well laid out, with great views of the park. We sat inside for our delicious dinner. The menu was varied, with plenty of options to choose from including vegetarian and vegan options. The food was very tasty and to a high standard and I would definitely recommend the lambay crab and avocado sandwich as a starter and Hereford steak as a main. 

As part of the staycation package, our parking was complimentary and we had a lovely relaxed walk in Herbert Park the following morning before checkout. I would also like to thank Siva and Victoria as well as the rest of the staff who looked after us. Highly recommend this hotel for a stay. Great location and quick access to city centre via bus and rail station nearby. ",5,2021,06,08

We went for the” staycation” option when booking and it didn’t disappoint. A room upgrade, Prosecco on arrival and beautiful views over Herbert Park and the mountains beyond. The room was fabulous, recently upgraded and spotlessly clean. Due to COVID restrictions we had to have our evening meal in the foyer. Not a problem as the foyer is very big and has comfy couches to sit back and relax in. The food was very good, in particular the seafood chowder, which my husband said was “the best he had ever eaten”! Breakfast was served in our room, again, not a problem as it allowed for us to relax while soaking up the lovely views. It was so nice to finally get away and we are delighted to have chosen the Herbert Park Hotel! We didn’t want to leave and we will definitely be back!",5,2021,06,07

Everything was completely within Government guidelines.   The restaurant was closed but Rommel organised for a chef to come in especially and provide a lovely lunch for 7 people.  We felt safe and so well looked after.  A day that, under the circumstances, we had expected to be merely functional, turned out to be magical!  And all thanks to you Rommel and your colleagues.

I hadn't booked breakfast but we were offered the option of having breakfast brought to the room.  The next morning it arrived at the time we had asked however by the time it got to the room it was quite cold and the poached eggs were very overcooked and the tea was really stewed but those are the only complaints. The staff that we had contact with throughout our stay were delightful and very friendly.  I know first impressions are very important but so are the final impressions and on check out I was left with the feeling that I would back as once again we were greeted by another smiling face courtesy of Irina.

All Covid restrictions were in place which is always good to see however there was great efficiency in that also and it all flowed very well
We dined in the hotel restaurant with our friends on Saturday night and from start to finish the food, service and choice of wine was excellent in very comfortable surroundings.
Following a great nights sleep we strollled over to the Herbert park markets and enjoyed a short walk and a coffee before heading to town.  Upon our return we were thrilled to be able to completely relax in the front foyer of the hotel and catch up on some reading.    
We just had to walk 150 yards to get to our restaurant for dinner and we were delighted with the location of the Herbert Park.

Check out was seamless and John went the extra mile to bring our luggage from the room to the car. 
Can’t wait for a rugby match and the excuse to book in again.

213,Nice,"We stayed in the park view apartments. The room was so nice and really clean! We had drinks in the bar near reception before going for dinner in the restaurant. The food was amazing. The only bad bit was when we finished our dinner, we went back to the bar to order a cocktail to bring back to our room. We where sitting waiting for 35 mins!! There was only 1 guy working at the bar i think his name was Jack, I heard him ask another member of staff for some help as he was really busy and the response he got was ""not my problem"". That was so rude and unprofessional in my opinion. He was so apologetic to us when he finally got the cocktails made. I didn't understand why no one would help him as there was 4/5 staff members just walking up and down the whole time that could have jumped in to help him. Other than that our stay was nice.",4,2020,12,10

213,A place I can call home.,I stayed at the Hebert Park hotel and Park residence for one month with my father before settling in my dorm room for university. The staff was incredibly nice and polite. The receptionists were very nice and helpful. We actually extended our stay from 3 weeks to 4 weeks because of how much we enjoyed it. Irani helped us with many things as well. The location was perfect; so many nice places at walking distance.  The farmer's market every Sunday was so nice. It was an incredible experience at a wonderful hotel.,5,2020,10,26
213,Excellent Location - good quality hotel,The hotel is in a great location with pubs and restaurants of all types on your doorstep. The rooms are modern and comfortable.

Very pleasant stay. Room very comfy and nice view of the park. Will be back for definite",5,2020,10,04
213,Great value hotel,"Great stay at this Ballsbridge hotel. Wide selection of room types to suit all visitors. Our room and ensuite was spacious and perfectly clean. Reception staff were friendly, knowledgable and always ready to help. The hotel is a reasonable walk from the centre of town but we found the local area catered fo all of our eating & drinking needs with parks and river walks all around.",5,2020,09,30
213,Nice hotel in a lovely location,"Unfortunately we had a long standing booking so we arrived on Friday and Dublin was locked down on Saturday and we left on Sunday as scheduled. The rooms are what you’d expect of a D4 hotel. Because of the COVID situation we were given our breakfast in our bedroom. This was fine and the service was good. Room service was excellent, Marta was very attentive and made sure we were well looked after.",4,2020,09,22
213,COVID Oasis,"The last time I stayed at the Herbert Park Hotel was late March 2020 before the country went into lock-down. So six months on, I was a little dubious about how the hotel would be operating in this new reality. 

I have to say it felt soooo good. I loved every second of my 4 night stay and did not want to leave. The hotel has done a great job of communicating and implementing social distancing and hygiene procedures. Above all, they managed to retain all of their front line staff so it was wonderful to see all their lovely people from Reception - Gerard, Irani and another lady who's name I don't recall - to all the fine food and beverage staff who remembered me and took the time to say hello, especially young Jack. Whenever I sat down to dine in the hotel, a member of their team would always be attending to me within 60 seconds no matter how busy they were.

My Residence apartment was immaculate and the Park views made for a very pleasant awakening every day. So thank you to everyone at the Herbert Park Hotel. It was great to be back and I look forward to staying with you again at the end of October, provided lock-down measures are eased. 

Well done to everyone concerned.",5,2020,09,21
213,Another perfect stay,"I have stayed at the Herbert Park Hotel many times over the last 15 or more years but, as this was a longer than usual trip, I decided to try the Park Residence studios and booked a park view room. 

Even before arrival I felt I was in safe hands as the hotel collected all required information to facilitate contactless check-in in advance. Incidentally, the hotel is participating in the Irish Government/Fáilte Ireland Covid-19 safety charter which definitely helps to reduce some of the anxiety travelling during the current pandemic. 

I was assigned a wonderful studio apartment on the 5th floor overlooking the park, I don't think I have ever enjoyed such a nice view from a Dublin hotel room so I can't recommend the park view rooms highly enough. 

The studio was spacious with a really comfortable bed (would possibly benefit from the addition of a mattress topper), spacious desk, lounge and dining area. For a longer stay I found the studio ideal as there was a small kitchenette so it was easy to pop out to nearby Ballsbridge or Donnybrook and pick up my own food. 

The rooms are super quiet with good aircon and electronically controlled curtains and blinds so it is easy to enjoy excellent sleep quality. 

WiFi was free and fast and there were no annoying login portals. 

The bathroom was also really spacious with a rain shower and great products. 

Service at the Herbert Park Hotel is always absolutely outstanding in my experience, any requests are attended to promptly. The whole team are super engaged with guests. I am always welcomed back by name and it feels like the team are genuinely committed to making sure guests enjoy their stay. I also like how I see some of the same team members here year after year. 

I would absolutely recommend the Park Residence, especially for a longer stay or even for a more independent shorter stay. 

As a Coeliac (gluten allergy) my only piece of developmental feedback is that it would be helpful if allergen information was provided on the room service menu. I can already feel like enough of a nuisance without having to seek out allergen information that should be available in writing. As a result of this not being available I just didn't order any room service. While this won't be relevant for most guests, other food allergy and intolerance sufferers will relate! If the hotel reach out to me on this I'll happily share my suggestions on making the F&B experience more positive for those with food allergies or intolerances.",5,2020,09,18
213,Herbert Park ,"Another great night at the Herbert Park Hotel. View of the park, friendly efficient staff, central location. Highly recommend making this your home from home. Room service was delicious and the hotel is managing the COVID-19 regulations very well. ",5,2020,09,18
213,Fabulous Hotel,"My partner and myself had a lovely stay here. The food was amazing. There was only 2 things that let them down. An opened jam jar was served with breakfast. Also when we opened the drawer in the bed locker,there was an empty bottle of wine in it, obviously from previous guests. Just little things that need attention to detail. We will definitely visit again.",4,2020,09,15
213,My best hotel stay in Dublin.,My best hotel stay in Dublin.  I had a bright and excellently equipped room overlooking Herbert Park.  Covid security measures were very reassuring. Professional &  personable staff.  Excellent choice of dishes for breakfast tray delivered on time to my room.,5,2020,09,15
213,0 facilities hotel,"An overpriced 4 stars (3 would be just fine) with 0 facilities. There is no Gym, no Pool, and no kids area.
It is close to some places like Aviva Stadium, the embassies and Herbert Park.
The room furniture was modern and there is an AC.",2,2020,09,14
213,Still Great,"Back to Herbert Park this weekend for the fourth time and felt so welcome. Staff were extremely focused on customer service, food was fab as always and the socially distanced bar had a lovely buzz. We will definitely be back 
",5,2020,09,14
213,Coming home,"My husband and I have missed staying here over the summer months and when we recently stayed it felt like coming home. We were given a warm welcome from Irani on reception  and Egle the acting general manager. We were also given an upgrade to a lovely room overlooking the park on the fifth floor . The reason we keep coming back to this hotel is  because we enjoy the relaxed atmosphere , the friendly staff ,the proximity to good restaurants,  Dublin City centre and direct access to the Herbert Park .Our recent visit was as always very comfortable and we felt safe in the present circumstances. Breakfast was served in our room and was excellent and our lunch in the Terrace Lounge was delicious . We are looking forward to our next visit.",5,2020,09,13
213,Yet another great experience!,"Returned to the Herbert Park once more and on this occasion we stayed in one of the amazing executive rooms! Beautiful, bright, spacious room with fabulous views of the park. The bathroom was also spacious and stunning and I loved the choice of showering facilities. The staff were top class - friendly, helpful, accommodating and always adhering  to COVID safety regulations. The food was excellent. We savoured dinner in the Terrace Bar with a varied menu and relaxing atmosphere. Our friendly receptionist, Irani checked us out ,again following COVID procedures. We loved our stay, felt so safe and we didn’t want to leave.",5,2020,09,13
213,Highly recommended - for everything you need when choosing a hotel!,"My stay at the Herbert Park Hotel was absolutely 10/10. All the staff were amazing & took care of my every need . I was greeted with a big smile and chat from Irina on arrival and helped with my tonne of luggage by the ever attentive and kind porter. My room was impeccably clean and maintained throughout my stay. The location is perfect for business, families and younger crowds - I saw all types of people in my time there (business stays, meetings, groups, families) - although it often felt like I had the place to myself! I was in the hotel for 2 weeks and always looked forward to coming back at night after work. The room was designed cleverly and spaciously so it felt like home and within days the staff knew my name! Nothing was ever a problem and I felt so relaxed and safe. What struck me the most were the staff and their sincere approach to hospitality - they are proud of their hotel and interested in the guests that come through the doors. The room service was excellent, the menu selection was varied & the apartment well stocked.  I would recommend it to anyone, rest assured they will take care of you! As a Dubliner- it's super close to the city centre yet quiet enough to feel far away. Thank you to all at the HPH, see you soon xxx
P.S. - This hotel is has implemented a covid safe system. There are clearly marked entrances and exits. Sanitising stations and reminder signs everywhere. All staff wear masks or visors and there is enough space throughout to socially distance.

The standards of cleanliness are first class and even with distancing the place has a warm and hospitable feel.

New Parkview rooms on fifth floor are well appointed with excellent bathrooms and decor.
Have stayed in all floors over the years and found the rooms excellent and well appointed.

Breakfast and service great even with restrictions in place.

Whilst the hospitality industry is under pressure the standards here remain A1 and nothing is too much trouble.

Have absolutely no problems in recommending this hotel to anyone and hope to be back soon

213,One of my favourite hotel stays to date,"Just checked out after a 4 night stay at Herbert Park Hotel. It was my first time staying here and I have to say it was absolutely one of the best hotels I've stayed at to date and I do visit alot of hotels. I was given a complimentary upgrade to an executive suite upon booking which I was very happy and surprised about but when I arrived the hotel exceeded all my expectations. On first arrival I was very happy with the procedures in place for covid and found the hotel absolutely impeccable. My room was perfect with everything I needed and more including a  fully stocked mini bar and nespresso coffee machine was a great added luxury. There was a box of chocolates with a lovely note from the hotel , robe and slippers also in my room upon arrival which was a lovely surprise. The room was absolutely spotless and I felt very safe with everything thats going on!  I ordered room service on two of the evenings and the food was absolutely delicious and and it was clear everything was cooked fresh. I was very very  impressed with the food! I was staying alone on this trip as I was sitting professional law exams but I definitely will be returning with my boyfriend soon! The staff at the hotel went above and beyond and I haven't received customer service like it in all my trips to hotels both in Ireland and abroad including to 5 star hotels. I cannot explain how much they made my trip on this stressful occasion studying for final exams. Will definitely be recommending to friends and I will be returning very room. Thank you.

The room was spacious and the addition of a coffee machine was great. Getting extra pods for coffee and milk was no problem.
Due to Covid 19 there was no dining room facility for breakfast, but we could order to our room, we don’t like eating in our hotel room so we just went out for breakfast. The area where the hotel is located is really nice, with lovely walks, restaurants and pubs. Also, the city centre is a nice walk away or easily accessed by taxi. Parking was €24 for the 2 night stay.",4,2020,08,08
213,Birthday Break,"We’re just back from a lovely 4 day break in the Herbert Park which is one of our favourite hotels in Dublin.

We got a complimentary upgrade to an executive room and a very competitive nightly room rate as part of the hotel’s drive to encourage guests to staycation in Dublin.
The hotel dining room is currently closed but breakfast, lunch and dinner are available in the lounge area. 
This hotel also offers beautiful new, fully fitted apartments, overlooking Herbert Park which would be ideal for families and are very competitively priced at the minute.
Looking forward to a return visit.",4,2020,08,08
213,Assumpta’s Birthday,"Just back from another great few days stay at The Herbert Park Hotel. This is a hotel that really knows how to look after guests.

All of the staff are so welcoming and friendly, particularly Jack and Sarah in the lounge and Gerard and Irani in reception.
Ballsbridge is a terrific place for a summer staycation with it’s many great restaurants and Herbert Park on your doorstep. Great deals to be had at the moment with upgrades available.

213,Lovely hotel,I last stayed here just as lockdown started. Delighted it has reopened although this stay was for a funeral. Gorgeous rooms. Staff are cheerful and friendly despite presumably being nervous about their job security. Breakfast can be had downstairs if prebooked but no buffet created logistical problems for servers. I miss the lovely buffet! Hopefully they will iron out the breakfast service and stay open. Great location of course. Fantastic value at the moment.,5,2020,08,06
213,Spend your money elsewhere.,"The rooms are very nice but the hotel overall for what your paying is extremely average. The lounge area is quite nice and spacious but the restaurant is a bit boring, It overlooks a car park and feels more like a work canteen than a nice hotel environment in fact the entire hotel screams “business trip”. I would definitely never book again.",2,2020,08,06
213,Recommend this hotel,"The executive room was big and very clean, the bed was comfortable but the pillows were a bit lumpy.  The ensuite had a shower over the bath which had good power and plenty of hot water. The staff were friendly and helpful especially Irani, requests were dealt with quickly and efficiently.

213,Date nite,Loving this beautiful hotel. I feel so safe. Husband just saying that you can just chill and forget about Covid. We feel in the heart of Dublin but because areas so big we are all very safely spaced. Lunch delish. Room so spacious. Such a lovely welcome also 🙏 staff so friendly and Arani gave us a lovely reception. Egle manager is running a fab spot here.,5,2020,07,24

213,Excellent Hotel,"We have stayed in the Herbert Park on numerous occasions over the years and have posted many positive reviews.  This was our first hotel stay post Covid restrictions and the Herbert Park was the obvious choice.  We are pleased to say that our stay was as good as any previous stay.  Hotel management have put in a lot of effort to keep guests and staff safe but still provide the usual high level of service - friendly and efficient staff, clean and comfortable rooms, great food and good value for money. The Herbert Park Hotel is highly recommended if you are staying in Dublin.",5,2020,07,20

213,Great Stay,"We have just stayed for one night at the Herbert Park Hotel. The hotel was exceptionally clean as was our room which was fab and had obviously recently been re-furbished. Breakfast was fab and was served to the room. The staff were brilliant and even during these strange times we had a really nice night away, we will definitely return. The location is great and the park beside it is beautiful for a stroll through. ",5,2020,07,14

213,Kind staff and beautiful hotel,"Our first trip to Dublin was marred by Covid 19. Upon arrival, we found our one guest in our party could not fly out from the states. The hotel reservations staff removed his room booking completely. From the moment we arrived, we were treated with warmth and hospitality.  We also had to cut our trip short due to travel restrictions from our country South Africa. We were fully reimbursed for the nights we did not stay. The staff were absolutely accommodating with all the last minute changes. We were helped by Irana, Rupa and Giuliano. The hotel is beautiful and the park outside is gorgeous. We enjoyed the restaurant downstairs and the atmosphere in the lounge area.  The hotel is walking distance to a lovely bistro where had breakfast and not far from DublinerBar which has an authentic 'bar' feel. We will need to make anther trip to Ireland to make us for the last one and will definitely be staying at Herberts Park.",5,2020,04,17
213,Excellent staff!,"A home away from home at a time when I needed it most. Thanks so much for having me and bending over backwards to make me feel at home there. 

Views of Herbert Park really made the studio apartment where I stayed. The downstairs lobby was very confortable too. ",5,2020,04,16
213,Very near city centre but benefiting from the serenity of park side location,"I always like to stay here. It is spotlessly clean and the staff are very efficient and caring. It is situated beside a gorgeous park and the neighbourhood is quiet which facilitates a night's sleep. The bedrooms are bright and clean, and the breakfast is delicious. The bus-stop  to town is 5 min walk from the hotel and it is a ten minute bus ride to the city. The hotel is situated in one of the leafiest, most sought after areas in Dublin. The price is also very reasonable, compared to city centre hotels. The relatively fair price combined with the excellent public transport to the city centre, makes this hotel my choice every time I visit our capital city.",5,2020,04,15
213,Business or Leisure you will be so pleased you chose here,"I am a regular visitor at this property , mostly for business but it always feels like I am returning to family... From reception where the welcome is always warm, the little things are always remebered your preferred room, newspaper choice etc. Bernie always on hand to unload bags, luggage, boxes exhibition stands. Restaurant knows your breakfast tea order and the nreakfast buffet is a real winner. As a business we have used the property for in excess of 10 years and we have s een changes but all the time the staff are what gives a property in a great location a 5Star experience.",5,2020,04,14
213,Best hotel to enjoy Dublin,"Having stayed in The Herbert Park hotel many times, I am writing to tell others that this hotel is the best hotel to stay in when visiting Dublin. The location, staff, bedroom & breakfast room are all fabulous. ",5,2020,04,11

213,A home from home!,"I have been staying at The Herbert Park on buisness for over 20 years. Its been a ""home from home"" for me. Have stayed in other Dublin Hotels but for me none match the wekcome that you always get from their wonderfula friendly staf. Great location and rooms in addition make this a must for anyone visitibg Dublin on either Buisneess or pleasure.

213,Welcoming,"Quiet, spacious hotel, right beside Herbert Park and close to lots of Ballsbridge amenities. EV chargers in the carpark are very convenient. Staff are very helpful and friendly.  Excellent restaurant and bar service.",5,2020,04,09
213,Wonderful one night stay,"Check in was a breeze with very friendly staff on reception and the room was great and much larger than I was expecting.  Coffee, tea making facilities and with toiletries available.  The most comfortable bed I've slept in for a while and the room was spotlessly clean.

Had a couple of drinks at the bar and again, very attentive and friendly staff.  Breakfast was amazing with a vast range to choose from.  The sausages were the best ever!  

I wouldn't hesitate to recommend this hotel",5,2020,04,09
213,Cant wait to return,"This hotel was the last place I stayed before the world changed. I stay here regularly and thought I would call out again just what a great place it really is.
The hotel has undertaken some additional works that have added to the overall property and I have no doubt this will prove to be a very attractive location for those looking for short / medium term stays in a brilliant location. 
One thing that will remain a constant feature however will be the amazing people you will come across who work at the Herbert Park Hotel. I am genuinely looking forward to returning to stay at the Herbert Park when the current situation passes and supporting a great property, business and bunch of people who always go the extra mile. At this time it is good to remember the things that we have to look forward to post Covid. A stay at the Herbert Park will be high up on my list!!",5,2020,04,09
213,Regular Business Visitor,"Always helpful front desk and generally great staff here. 
Rooms very clean and plenty big enough rooms. Lovely park right next to the hotel for running and a couple of restaurants within an easy walking distance. 
Only area for improvement would be the gym but I understand that is being reviewed presently.",5,2020,04,09
213,My Dublin Home,"i don't live in Dublin and for many years the Herbert Park has been my Dublin home.  Whether I am there for work, or with the family, we have stayed there more times than I can remember.  There's a reason for that. The location is great, the rooms are generously sized and are always fresh. The team are  genuine and are very good at remembeing me when I show up, knowing the little things like room preferences that I like, or enquiring as to how the family are doing.  Importantly the hotel  rarely jumps on the price hike bandwagon around big events, unlike so many hotels in Dublin City Centre.

I don't normally write TripAdvisor reviews but I think it's important at this time for me to remember and to recognise that value and quality are concepts that sustain. These traits will bring me back to the Herbert Park again when all this Covid-19 stuff is behind us.  I wish Egle and her great team good health and encourage them to have the strength to persevere, and for them to know that there will be better days after this difficult time.",5,2020,04,09
213,Exceptional,"I have stayed at the Herbert Park Hotel many times. This is a great hotel with exceptional staff. Pound for pound it has got to be one of the best if not THE best hotel in Dublin. The staff are warm, friendly and genuine and do their utmost to accommodate guests' requests and assist at every turn. From reception, restaurant, bar and housekeeping service is excellent. Nothing is too much bother for Egle, Laya, Irani, Rupa, Jack and all the staff. The rooms are very comfortable and cosy. Nearby are the Aviva stadium, RDS, Leinster Rugby, Herbert Park and city centre. Staying at the Herbert Park Hotel is like being at home. If you like to feel appreciated during your stay, this is the place for you. I cannot recommend this place highly enough. Thanks to ALL at the Herbert Park Hotel and see you again soon.",5,2020,03,27
213,Wonderful,"I’ve stayed here quite a bit recently and I must complement the staff who make this lovely hotel what it is .
A special thank you to Lara , Gerard and Adam all of whom have been extremely professional and helpful to me during my stay .
The hotel is perfect in every way and I can’t find fault .

Look forward to my next visit .

213,Studio Apartment - Amazing stay,"I stayed at Herbert Park during an unexpected work trip. Since day one, my stay was brilliant. Work arranged for me to stay in one of the hotels residences, a studio apartment. The location is brilliant with easy food near by such as Embassy Grill. The food & drinks at the hotel are also great.

The room included all necessities with A cook top and pans etc. The room has been fitted out well with electric curtains & wall mounted TV. 

Jack & Irani who are staff at the Hotel; made my stay what it was. Without the staff it would have been a great stay. With Jack & Irani, it was a memorable & pleasurable stay which left a lasting impression for me. They are a key reason I will be making a point to stay at Herbert Park next time im in Dublin ! 

Access to the city is easy enough with taxis,Bus or short walk. Landsdowne road station is only 900m away with easy access on the DART to Howth which is a great day out. ",5,2020,03,21
213,Friendly and fabulous,Beautiful hotel really friendly and helpful staff. My spouse was in hospital and they couldn't have been nicer.

RDS very near and a 3 minute drive to St Vincent's hospital. Would highly recommend this hotel.,5,2020,03,21
213,Lovely hotel but Grumpy Night Porter,"Fantastic rooms and location.       
Night porter could have been more accommodating to us in return from two nights out in the city centre. Especially as coronavirus was kicking in and the city was locking down. ",4,2020,03,20
213,"Great hotel, excellent staff, probably the best in Dublin 4","I've stayed in a number of hotels in the Ballsbridge area of Dublin over the past year but this is now my first choice.

213,Very comfortable!,"Stayed here on the 25/26 February a wee bit of business and also pleasure. Over all everywhere was spotless, our room extremely comfortable, full channels , superking bed was great as we have one at home and when we travel I hate to see a small double bed, coffee/ tea and water in the room. Air conditioning also ,so you can control the temp. We finished each day with a night cap in the bar, the young lad o  duty both nights Jack I think his name was, was extremely polite and nothing was a problem for him, great to see a young lad who clearly enjoys his work, very pleasant ! Will diffinetly be back. Great stay and close to the RDS..

213,Seriously good and thoughtful service,"We regularly stay in the Herbert Park hotel when in Dublin, as we like the staff , the venue and we find it a handy place, in the buzz of Ballsbridge and yet beside the peace of Herbert Park.
 Last week I turned up with no bags having booked late, as my wife had an unexpected overnight stay in a Dublin Hospital. The receptionist spotted this and produced a toothbrush and toothpaste for me! It was a very kind thing to do , and typical of the way they work in there.
Thank you",5,2020,02,25

213,Not what I was expecting,"The grounds the lobby all beautiful until check in. My husband and I arrived separate as he was working in Dublin so we had 2 cars of which we were both charged, an extra €24 onto our room rate. Really not happy with this, parking should be covered in your rate that you pay. 
Room was lovely but we booked a double room which was 2 single beds pushed together. Not comfortable, and not what you would expect from a 4 star hotel! I do want to compliment the lovely receptionist, very helpful ",3,2020,02,23

We had breakfast included that was excellent. One of the best breakfast experience in my life. That was 5 star quality with good view looking over green. 

One last thing is that the parking is not free. More or less €13 for a night.",4,2020,02,20
213,Wonderful stay,"I really enjoyed my stay here on both occasions during the Six Nations. The room was wonderful and comfortable and provided extra facilities, which I didn’t need, but it was still very good to have. The food at breakfast was definitely worth waking up early for.

A fine ambassador for Dublin’s fair city!",5,2020,02,04
213,When an upgrade is certainly not an upgrade!!!,"Staff heavily pushed ""a beautiful new room"" to us upon checking in, making it sound like a beautiful upgrade with an additional charge of E30. Taking their word we went with this option only to find out it was an apartment and much less impressive that the room we originally booked. Needless to say we requested back to original booking. This was completed eventually and we stayed in a much nicer room however we most certainly did not need the added pressure as we were rushing to the Aviva for a rugby game nor did we appreciate being taken for fools by staff.
When we advised reception staff of our disappointment on checking out it was practically ignored and staff member was not in the slightest concerned.
We stayed here numerous times through my husband's work for local functions and had no issues however this has been more than disappointing and we will be looking elsewhere for future bookings.",1,2020,02,03
213,Business hotel that is my home away from home,"The staff at Herbert Park Hotel are committed to the ultimate in customer service, making the experience like you never left home.  They are accommodating, considerate of needs and tireless work to de-stress being away from home.  As a seasoned business traveler, it is great to return here because I am confident everything will be top shelf and welcoming.  I have yet to meet a staff member who does not go the extra mile to help and anticipate needs.  Of special note is Irani at reception.

A view, refurbished, clean and quiet. Only to be disappointed I was staying only for one night in this very pleasant location of Dublin 4 (Ballsbridge). Commitment of staff to be professional, sympathetic and committed is to be noted. My check-in late in the afternoon, early evening was made even more smooth thanks to receptionist Irani. Herself and her colleagues were worthy of working there. Well done to them :-)",4,2020,01,27

Well appointed, not at all care-worn (as you might expect) and always good value when we've visited.

My only niggles, and they are not even huge niggles, more equipment in the gym would be nice, and if breakfast could even start at 6.30 am, it would help as i start work at 0700 most days when i'm there.
Looking forward to my next stay.",5,2020,01,14

- Staff attentiveness and helpfulness",4,2020,01,12

They were so excited to come back to the hotel, having not been there in a few years. Two now live in Dublin, but were still excited by the prospect of a Leinster match and staying in the hotel.
Personally, I love the great service I get from all the team there, and it is consistent, even with those that I have not met before. The lounge area is very special, but my girls were holding out for the breakfast, it is their most favorite part of the stay..
The walk around the Park on a dry Sunday morning (or any morning) is very special, and particularly in a busy city. 
My favorite parts are, good value, always comfortable, a great team, very easy to get to, good parking, and so easy to grab a taxi to anywhere in the city (and get back).
We will be back..",5,2020,01,07

213,Beautiful!,Visited here for new year. The rooms are so luxurious and spacious given the good value price and the area is gorgeous. There is a lovely Italian over the road and a number of bars and pubs just a stones throw away. The reception was very kind when checking out. I cannot remember the name but an Asian lady dealt with me and she was so kind to let us keep our luggage safe while we ventured out to dublin on our last day. The reception area is beautiful with a large bar and seating area. The only negative was the drinks selection at the bar seemed a bit limited and the prices were very high costing €13 for two low alcohol drinks. Overall I would without a doubt stay here again if visiting dublin.,5,2020,01,03

213,Christmas.,"Was not first choice as was let down, but not sorry. Nice hotel, good location with great rooms and helpful staff. Poor bar food selection, kin my opinion compared to other bar type food..), and very expensive drink prices. ",3,2019,12,28
213,Pre Christmas treat,"Lovely night spent just before Christmas. Breakfast was lovely with a beautiful view of Herbert park. Car parking service was excellent.  Overall we were delighted with our pre Christmas treat and the Herbert Park Hotel, Dublin ",5,2019,12,27
213,Christmas break,"Third time returning with family for Christmas. Perfect location,great staff and wonderful quality food.Great experience from booking to departure.The restaurant service was professional and friendly throughout our stay.",5,2019,12,27
213,GREAT LOCATION,"Nice staff, friendly check in a bit tight in car park, thought the 12 euro parking charge a bit much especially as the room rate was not cheap ! The young man called Jack who looked after us in the bar was one in a million, a young fellow going places I hope. Nothing too much trouble and a nice friendly personality.",4,2019,12,24
213,Not good value for the price,we chcked in as a couple and they gave us twin room! then we should go back to check in deak and ask for a double bed! There was also smell of smoke in the room. Unfriendly and unattentive ataff. Lifts very old and not good instructions for using the key cards in the lift! ,2,2019,12,23
213,What a pleasant surprise,"I usually stay at the Shelbourne or The Westbury when in Dublin for business but needed to stay near to Ballsbridge so opted for the Herbert Park Hotel. On check in, we were upgraded to the new Private Residences at the Herbert Park Hotel and we were delighted with the experience. Brand new apartment-style rooms set in a private wing, these rooms come with generous shower space, washing machine, dishwasher, coffee machine, fridge, cutlery and crockery. There is a sofa and living area with a big TV as well as a decent size bed next to a huge patio window. I was very pleasantly surprised and will definitely be returning. The Ballsbridge location is just a short taxi into the city centre. Staff, as usual were friendly and efficient and a big thank you goes out to Egle who efficiently expedited all my requests, the two girls at reception Irani and Rupa who were always smiling and could not do enough for us. The bar staff were also very efficient and friendly and it was heart-warming to be 'remembered' by the very courteous Jack from my last visit. The Herbert Park Hotel is a hidden gem in Dublin city centre - close enough to the the City, fantastic new rooms in the Residence wing and located in the leafy 'village' of Ballsbridge so you can go for a run or walk away from the crowds. Highly recommended.",5,2019,12,23
213,Great value for money,"This hotel always offers very good value for money. Friendly and helpful staff, good service, good rooms, good breakfasts and parking. Yes, it’s a bit of a walk into the city centre but overall a very good place to stay in Dublin. Very happy to stay here again. ",4,2019,12,23
213,GOB,"I recently had the occasion to stay at The Herbert Park Hotel.Rupa and Gerard at Reception were exceptionally helpful.They upgraded me to a suite.I had a family member in hospital, so each morning I needed to book another night which they made seamless. 
I can highly recommend this hotel.",5,2019,12,23
213,First Class,I stayed here a few times previously and always experienced very good service but I would think that it has actually improved to a new level . All staff encountered were very efficient and friendly. Breakfast was very good . I have booked again for my next trip to Dublin .,5,2019,12,22
213,so satisfied,"Recently stayed in the Herbert Park for two nights and as per our previous visits had a great experience . I would have no hesitation in recommending the hotel to my friends due to the friendliness of the staff, quality of rooms, service in all departments, quality of food and cleanliness throughout the building.
It is close to city many amenities and a bus stop 50mtrs from the door.
Location could not be better and great value.",5,2019,12,20
213,A home away from home,It is such a pleasure to arrive at the Herbert Park and for the staff to give you such a warm welcome greeting you by name as they remember you from your last visit. Parking is never an issue and location is excellent. ,5,2019,12,19
213,Herbert Park A Nice break away,"We arrived in the afternoon after some Christmas shopping. Friendly face at check-in, no issues and plenty of help with the bags if needed. Very friendly experience, very tasty food for what we had. Would I recommend the hotel....yep, going back early in the new year.",5,2019,12,19
213,Xmas Party Rugby Match 14.12.19,"Excellent Hotel and Facilities - Staff were so friendly and efficient 
The hotel is in a brilliant location - and will definitely re-visit in 2020 - We had a lovely view from the Room - 
Very good value for money",5,2019,12,17
213,Excellent Experience,Located in a prime area close to the Aviva Stadium the hotel was great value in comparison to other city centre hotels. The rooms are recently renovated and are excellent with self-catering facilities. The staff were extremely friendly and welcoming and I will return.,5,2019,12,17
213,Another great stay in this hotel,"I've stayed many times in this great hotel and every time this hotel delivers. A stunning location that offers beautiful views over the park. The breakfast options are extensive and cater for all. The best part of this hotel experience is the staff. Always helpful, friendly and go the extra mile to ensure you've a great stay. The rooms are spacious, spotless , comfy and offer a great nights sleep as there's zero noise pollution.  ",5,2019,12,16
213,My home from home when I’m in the Capital,"I love this Christmas time of year, especially when it involves a trip to the Capital. I get the opportunity to stay at the Herbert Park Hotel, the place I describe as my home from home when I’m in the Capital. It’s seasonal decorations are welcoming, as are the wonderful staff who are so welcoming and friendly throughout the year. First class people in a first class property. ",5,2019,12,14
213,Comfortable,"Was only here one night. Comfortable and spacious room. Well equipped as was the bathroom. Quiet, so a good night's sleep.

Breakfast was good - they even had a separate gf section ( being a coeliac, this is a bonus for me when I stay away 😊)",4,2019,12,12
213,2 day business meeting,"I have just got home following a fabulous two day
Business meeting in the Herbert Park hotel with 20 of my colleagues. The service was outstanding with two fantastic girls at reception -Irani and Rupa. The food and meeting room were superb and we were excellently looked after by Adam and Lana. They are utter professionals and we will return.",5,2019,12,11
213,Another relaxing stay,"We are regular guests at the Herbert Park and always enjoy staying there.  Lovely rooms, clean and comfortable.  Breakfast is first class and the food in the lounge is delicious.  The hotel was busy this weekend but we had no issues with service. The staff are great ambassadors for this hotel.  Gerard checked us in and out and it’s nice to be able to have a bit of humour with staff.  Egle is such a lovely friendly girl and always welcomes us when we visit.  Looking forward to our next visit ",5,2019,12,10
213,Herbert Park Bliss!,"We have stayed at the Herbert Park for the past 4 years now on our annual trip & it’s second to none. Food (Christmas Goose), staff (Ewan & Team) & premises are five star 🌟 - perfectly presented & immaculately clean.
Will be back next year - wouldn’t go anywhere else in Dublin!",5,2019,12,09
213,Disappointing,"Pros:
-Room was small but very nice
-Nesspresso and water in room was a great touch

Cons:
-Heater makes a noise all through the night
-Construction on the second floor started at 7am
-Room is old and in need of remodeling
-false fire alarm at midnight was the icing on the cake

Bottom line:
-I was here for three nights but could not have a night of peaceful sleep.",2,2019,12,06
213,Easy check in,"Great stay at the Herbert park great location in Ballsbridge just a short taxi or bus into Dublin city centre. 
Competitive room rate available.
Was perfect for our night in Dublin away from the kids!
Ellga and her team at reception couldn’t have more helpful in getting our early check in sorted without fuss so we could head into town for a bit of shopping and a few drinks after! 
Lovely park right at the hotel for a walk to clear any cobwebs from night before!
All in all would really recommend this hotel for a stay in Dublin City for shopping/socialising or business.

",5,2019,12,04
213,Consistency is the secret to success.,"I stay at the Herbert Park two or three times per year.
It’s consistent high standards is what makes me return .
Keep up the good work .Breakfast is a dining experience in itself with a superb buffet. Enjoyed an evening meal in the bar of very good quality.  All in all a very pleasant experience with customer service of a very high standard..",5,2019,12,03
213,Amazing stay in Herbert Park hotel apartment,"Recently stayed in one of the apartments with nice view of the park. Everything was perfect, room big and cozy, lots of amenities, and fabulous bathroom. We were so lucky to get beautiful sunset view which was amazing. Breakfast in the morning very good, nothing was missing. Very pleasant check in and check out. Our our departure receptionist Rupa was very nice and professional. She gave a final perfect touch to our stay. We will definitely be back.",5,2019,12,03
213,Afternoon Tea,"We have gone to afternoon tea in most of the Hotels in Dublin. And with out doubt we  Agreed the Afternoon Tea for the price was very poor for what we received. Nothing wrong with the taste but the  quantity and presentation was so poor and at €26.50 was over charged.  (The first hotel we did not need a dogie bag to take home) We spoke to the server and she agreed with us the Afternoon was not worth the price and I asked her to bring to the attention of the Manager.

I attach a photo and I think the photo speaks for its self. A four Star hotel should be ashamed of this afternoon Tea.(Your website photo is nothing like my photo!!!) For a hotel with similar price look at Killiney Castle plus  you get a table cloth on your table.",1,2019,11,25
213,Dublin Night Away,"Stayed in The Herbert Park Hotel last week, hotel is in Ballsbridge with a number of pubs and restaurants close by and short taxi ride into Dublin City Center, public bus service also available. Hotel is lovely with friendly staff, very clean. I had booked a twin room but was disappointed to find the two beds pushed together and sharing a headboard. I was sharing with a work colleague and would have preferred some space between the beds. Bed was very comfy, bottle of water supplied and a nice box of chocolates to apologize for any inconvenience during some renovations, which I discovered next morning when I opened the curtains next morning to scaffolding. As it was a Sunday, no issues but had it been a week day it might have been a different story. Room had everything we needed, iron, ironing board, toiletries, hair dryer and coffee maker and mini bar. Good air conditioning also.
Residents bar was open until 3.30 with  very friendly staff. Our room price was 164 euro with a discount for signing up so came in at 147, breakfast was not included.
Breakfast was 16 euro for continental and 21.50 euro for full Irish . This is where the hotel fell down for me. Breakfast was expensive and was not a good Irish breakfast. Food was quite dried out. The bacon was very fatty smoked streaky, the type you get on the continent, sausages had a strange taste and overall Neither myself nor my friend enjoyed it.
Parking for the night was 12 euro.
Overall cost came to 202 euro for the night and while hotel is lovely I probably would not use again as overall cost was not value for money. If breakfast had been good I probably would have been happier.",4,2019,11,24
213,Second bad stay,We stayed here last night and are leaving having not been able to sleep. The room we were given had a large air conditioning unit outside which was very loud. We rang reception at 1am to ask could it be turned off or what could they do as we needed sleep. They did move us to another room although the noise was just as bad so we spent the night not having much rest. On a previous stay I had left a jacket behind on ringing the hotel afterwards to collect it they informed me it was not there. Beware your belongs in the hotel and don’t leave anything valuable in the room.,1,2019,11,23
213,Excellent location & super staff!,"It’s the second time we have stayed here & not disappointed.
The friendliness of the staff is fantastic and they couldn’t be more helpful.
Great hotel all round.
A softer bed would be more comfortable but that’s just my preference.",5,2019,11,20
213,Enjoyable Stay,"Four of us stayed at this hotel for a 2 night break. We found it very clean and welcoming  with the most friendly and helpful staff. Beds were comfortable and bathroom had enough toiletries, also the coffee machine and pods were always stocked up. As it was 4 of us found it just as cheap to get around in taxis as it was by bus,but the bus stop wasn't far away. Didn't eat at hotel so can't comment on that but did enjoy a few drinks. Would stay again if we returned to Dublin",5,2019,11,16
213,Ideal location for a Drinks Party or a Reception (Best Room in Dublin).......,"Herbert Park hotel is wonderfully located in Dublin 4 with frontal views of Ballsbridge Center and the river while the rear view from the restaurant backs onto Herbert Park and may be the breakfast view in the City.

Post a Funeral on Weds, I hosted a reception there in the Back room which is typically the restaurant and it was excellent. Previously I had hosted another event in the conference / banquet room overlooking the river on Floor 1 but the Restaurant is better, has more light and on a fine day, you have a patio to use. Dealing with the staff (Lara, the Manager on duty who 'managed the event') was  treat. Courteous and efficient while sensitive under sad circumstances. Pro-active is offering menu and drink suggestions also. Staff were brilliant on the day in terms of service and also post event which was 3 - 6 pm found room for us in the lounge. Food menu was excellent and feedback from guests very positive. Pricing was good, no room rental charge and very reasonable. Clear and itemized bill to conclude the event also. Very recommendable for any event.
A classy touch was to throw in free parking for al guests up to 3 hours. Super location.",5,2019,11,16
213,Wk end away,"We recently stayed at this hotel and had a lovely experience. I travelled up on a late train and was greeted by a very pleasant receptionist with a smile . She later helped me with my friend who suffered with her back. Obtaining crushed ice for her and was very thorough,  informative and thoughtful.  
Bfast was.a buffet style but there was a touch of class to it . Honey comb available,  yogurts in beautiful ceramic pot which we were encouraged to recycle . When you asked for Porridge you were also asked would you like it made with water or milk the little things that ment a lot . We dined out so I cant comment on dinner but everything was good to me",5,2019,11,12
213,Excellent,Beautiful hotel. Very quiet and peaceful. So convenient to the RDS for events. Very comfortable room. The Nespresso machine was such a treat in the room! Food was delicious in the restaurant. Enjoyed a walk in the neighbouring park.,5,2019,11,10
213,Leinster Rugby,"Recently spent 2 nights at Herbert Oark Hotel - visiting Irelant to see family, but was also attending Leinster Rugby match

Perfect for events at nearby RDS or Aviva stadium

Lovely area D 4. Lots of local restaurants and pubs - would recommend The Bridge

Room was immaculate. 
Massive comfy bed
Staff very helpful 

Would recommend

Breakfast very expensive!?",4,2019,11,06
213,Bad stay,"Very noisy because of works from 7 am during 2 days.

We took the residence with Park view, the flat is quite cold without any charm. 
Reception is too big and empty.
We  could think it is a business / offices building more than a hotel as it is cold atmosphere. 

No customer service at the check out. No efforts done at all for clients. 

I Will not come back and do not recommand it. 

",1,2019,11,05
213,Wonderful location. Lovely Staff. Great breakfast.,Have stayed here previously on business but this trip was with my wife and children. My son was graduating from College. The Hotel was located perfectly for both the ceremony and the Restaurant that we celebrated in. Great to have the convenience of the car park also. The Staff were welcoming and helpful. The breakfast was first class.Try the egg's benedict. A winner. Thank you to everyone at the Hotel. We will be back.,5,2019,11,04
213,"Clean rooms, helpful staff","I stayed at this hotel while attending a conference at the nearby RDS (which is a 2 minute walk away). I just needed a quiet base of operations where I could get rest after long conference days and I got just that - mostly. There was some random banging/constructions sounds that caused some disturbance for a bit of time in the morning and I would have liked it if the staff had given me a warning about it, but it was a minor oversight. The room did not come equipped with an iron, which was another minor inconvenience.",4,2019,11,01
213,Apartments are fantastic addition to excellent hotel,I stay in the Herbert Park on a regular basis. On my last stay I was upgraded to one of the new apartments.  I had an excellent stay in a beautiful well appointed apartment overlooking the peaceful park.  It would be ideal for short or longer stays. Service in the hotel was excellent as always.,5,2019,10,30
213,Excellent Hotel,"Stayed a few times, the Ballsbridge area is great and the walk to the centre is very pleasant especially through the Donnybrook village area.  The rooms are great, very clean and quite spacious. The rates are always a good price. Recommend.",5,2019,10,28
213,Comfortable hotel in a nice area,"Have stayed here before, and the hotel is clean, comfortable and in a really nice part of town. 

Staff are professional and friendly, they will look after you well. Nearby are some good restaurants and it’s an easy walk to the city centre, through a nice part of town which feels safe at night. 

There is some building work going on at the hotel, but we only stayed at the weekend so didn’t notice any issue with noise outside, it was perfectly quiet and relaxing staff. 

Enjoyed it and will stay here again",4,2019,10,27
213,First Class Hotel in lovely Ballsbridge,"Every week I spend two nights a week in the Ballsbridge area on business and have stayed at pretty much all the hotels within a mile or so radius and I can confidently say the Herbert Park Hotel is my favourite and now my regular stopover.  Very clean and professional hotel with great rooms and amenities and very friendly staff.

On a couple of recent visits I stayed in the new Park Residence apartments and these are awesome.  Totally new with everything you could ever need in the room so if you're planning a longer stay it would definitely be worth the extra to give these a try.",5,2019,10,25
213,Another great night and morning,Another great night at this hotel. Staff brilliant with an amazing breakfast. love this hotel situated in Ballsbridge. Some great bars with lovely walks through the park. Will be back before xmas. Ballsbridge is my favourite area in Dublin with easy access to St Stephens green and shopping area. ,5,2019,10,23
213,A few tips though...,"Lovely staff, delicious room service...
Suggestions though: 
Full length mirror, it’s weird you don’t..
Shampoo AND conditioner - I don’t know any women who use 2 in one, it’s horrible..
Not very sustainable, you should have a shower gel, shampoo and conditioner dispenser that you fill up as opposed to wasting plastic unnecessarily..

Thanks!",4,2019,10,23
213,Rude & Disappointing Service,"This was our final hotel of a great CIE tour & what a dissapointment!   Pretty place but horrible service!   I waited 45 minutes for our suitcases to arrive ( took 5-10 min other hotels).   Room was fine, but we had to leave Early in the morning to catch our plane and the breakfast that they served us was disgraceful. It was basically cornflakes and coffee. It would've been nice if they had just included a scone and a cup of coffee. My girlfriend never got any breakfast served to her. The person at reception was very rude and gave no eye contact!    I've been on many tours, at least eight, and every time I have left early to catch a plane, I've always been given at least one or two boxes of treats to take with me. This was a disgrace. My next trip to Ireland will not include this hotel.",1,2019,10,18
213,Disgraceful,"Absolutely disgusted with this stay. I sit here in bed awake since 8 o clock this morning due to constant hammering on the roof above my head. I don’t know how you expect anyone to relax or sleep with these conditions. When I phoned reception I was told “we are fully booked, I’ll let the duty manager know” and didn’t even get a call back to apologize. I understand that everyone may not want to sleep in on Wednesday but I feel this hotel room shouldn’t be given to people who have come to a hotel to relax with hammering and construction above our heads first thing in the morning. A waste of €205 in my opinion. I have videos but am unable to upload only photos.",1,2019,10,17
213,Exceeded all my expectations,"Location = far away from city center (very quiet neighborhood) - there bus stops 3-5 minutes away that will take you into and through the city

Stuff = super friendly, super helpful, excellent sense of humor

Room = very clean, very nice furniture, very ergonomic and comfortable

Curtains = cover the window completely - light from the sides will not wake you in the morning

I will definitely stays at that hotel again.

Notes:
(1) Book in advance as early as possible.
(2) AC in the room - (A) after you set the desired temperature, it takes some time for the unit to start working ; (B) recommend setting fan speed to 2 bars or even 3 bars ; (C) recommend disabling ""Timer Off"" setting, so the unit continues to work while you are in the room
(3) There are several small restaurants near the hotel
(4) Stuff in the Pavilion Restaurant (for breakfast) is super attentive, polite",5,2019,10,13
213,Most amazing stay,"I'd like to take the time to broadcast to the world as to how nice this hotel is .
But most of all its the friendliness of  the staff that compliment the beautiful rooms, most of all our receptionist Davide was the most professional and courteous with a few minor issues and because of him I will defiantly recommend and positively sing high praises for this hotel ! All the staff and property A++",5,2019,10,12
213,"Lovely, Relaxing Stay","The staff were friendly, informative and helpful.
The room was clean and we loved the decor.
The hotel is slightly out of the way - about a 25 minute walk into the center but there were plenty of bus stops and we found it very easy to navigate our way into the city center.",5,2019,10,07
213,Noisy...,"Generally a nice hotel in a reasonable location. We needed an afternoon nap after a very early flight into Dublin. I asked if we were getting a quiet room and was assured that it was but as soon as we got to the room we could hear drilling etc very close to our room. After a number of calls to reception they finally acknowledged that there was work going on next door but it should finish in a couple of hours. Why not just state the truth from the start and manage expectations. Really disappointed with staff, poor training perhaps. I used to use this place for business trips but haven’t used it since",3,2019,09,24
213,Great Hotel and Service,Beautiful hotel in a tremendous setting.  Very helpful and courteous staff from arriving through to departure.  Breakfast buffet the best I have ever seen.  Room was very well set up and very comfortable.,5,2019,09,22
213,Great service,"Every staff member was helpful and courteous. The breakfast was outstanding and overlooked a beautiful park. The room was clean and well stocked. We only stayed one night, but would have liked to have stayed longer. We were with a touring group so don’t know the cost of the rooms nor about parking nor about location to city stores and points of interest.",5,2019,09,21
213,Lily Cronin,"Fantastic hotel.lovely location on Herbert Park. From checkin everything was amazing. Room was spacious very comfortable and had all essentials  Staff are superb 
 Breakfast is wonderful  and  bar good delicious  Will return💚

..",5,2019,09,18
213,Very Nice Stay,"We actually stayed here at the beginning of our 14 day trip and at the end of our trip.  Both times the Staff were very good.  There were a total of 6 of us with 3 rooms.  All of our rooms were nice and for any items we needed extra pillows etc they were great in getting to u, the rooms were always very clean..  They also went out of their way to help us get vans ordered so we did not have to pay for 2 separate Taxis.   
The Herbert Park was an extra we did not realize when booking, loved to be able to walk around the Park.  One nice thing we came to appreciate that they had Air Conditioning which we have found out is not common in Ireland.  Would defienetly stay there again.",4,2019,09,18
213,Amazing. Lovely friendly staff. The best hotel rooms. Stunning location.,"The receptionist said our room was a new apartment like room just opened, and they were very interested in what we thought of them.  They were beautiful, the way they were thought out, lots of room at the entrance for wardrobe, kitchen facilities with built in microwave etc., a lovely 2 seater couch & table gave you all the amenities of independant living.  The partician between the living room & the bed was cut steel, it left the light through to the living area but still gave privacy to the bedroom.  The bed was luxuriously soft & comfy & dreamy as a hotel bed should be.
The julian balcony allowed the breeze in to the room.  There were electronic black-out blind and curtains.
Our room was looking out over Herbert Park with beautiful old trees, flower beds and paths, it gave a lovely relaxing feeling while staying in a built up part of the city.  You walked out the door of the hotel and your on Ballsbridge with its famous pubs & restaurants and a stones-throw from the Aviva Stadium.",5,2019,09,18
213,No sleep here. Staff on rampage at 6 20 AM,"Booked this place at a cost of 285 Euro. We were woke up at 6 20 by a hotel worker knocking on room next door  to deliver room service. When the door wasent opened he started to shout room service. We had a 5 hour drive ahead of us. Not good enough. When i complained at desk during check out, i was told it was the guests Father who made all the racket. This was complete rubbish of course. I asked them to at least cover our 12 Euro parking fee. They said No. So my advice is stay away from this dump.",1,2019,09,17
213,Very Disappointed!,"I have stayed at this hotel on a few previous occasions and really enjoyed my stay in the very comfortable rooms. This time I booked a deluxe room and was looking forward to my stay. On arrival we were told that the hotel was very busy that weekend and we had been upgraded to one of the new apartments.Firstly the elevators for the apartments are not in the main lobby. What we were allocated was on the 5th floor, it was like a studio apartment (a bedsit) it was well equipped (if that's what you want) with hob, microwave, dishwasher, washing machine/dryer fridge and coffee machine.There was a small dining table and sofa and a nice TV. The decor was quite dark and the only view from the window was another big window of the block across from us, we had to keep the curtains drawn and the lights on as a result. The en suite was fine but had no bath.The bed was comfy but I felt I was sleeping in a kitchen/dining room and it was not nice stepping out of bed onto a hardwood floor. It certainly was not an area that one would sit around in to relax and read/watch TV. and was not what I had booked and in my opinion NOT an upgrade. I was glad I was only staying one night and was out and about most  of the time as it was not a room for relaxing in. The breakfast was very good as usual  and the service and staff in both bar and dining room was excellent. When I mentioned to reception that I was not at all happy with my SO CALLED UPGRADE I was told they they would note my profile not to put me in that room again. Not good enough in my opinion! Very disappointed with my stay. I will now check other options in the area for my next stay.",4,2019,09,17
213,Park Residence,"I stayed here with my mum and sister for a weekend away. On arrival, we were told we had been upgraded to an apartment in the Herbert Residence. The room was brand new, spacious and comfortable. The bathroom was amazing too - the heated tiles were fab. The room would be perfect for someone who wanted to come to Dublin for a few days and have a bit more space. We would recommend the hotel to others.",5,2019,09,16
213,Return Visit,"We stayed here two years ago and enjoyed the executive room, however on this visit the beautiful petite fours delivered daily had been down-graded to one chocolate each per day and the room did not have a park view.  The coffee machine was as good as before the daily newspaper was welcome. Compared to other executive rooms we have stayed in recently this was not as spacious but then again this is Dublin.  As before the staff were welcoming, efficient and friendly. The hotel is very well kept with everything being immaculate. Ballsbridge is a lovely area of Dublin and it’s easy to get to the city centre and to attractions south of Dublin.  We would stay here again but not sure it’s worth paying extra for an executive room.",4,2019,09,11
213,Great Business Hotel,"One of my favourite hotels to stay in Dublin when on business. Ive been staying here almost weekly over the last 2 years and its superb.
Rooms are spacious, spotlessly clean, very comfortable beds, great tea/coffee facilities and brilliant bathrooms with powerful water pressure.
Always plenty of parking. Reception team always very friendly and helpful. Breakfast is always top quality with a wide variety to choose from. Service at breakfast is firat class.
Bar area is relaxed and hood range of food and drinks available.
Having the park on its doorstep is very handy for jogging, walking etc and the gym whilst small is perfect if the weather turns.
Loads of restaurants and bars literally on their doorstep and convenient for city centre travel also.
Management and staff there all very helpful and friendly.
Highly reccomend.",5,2019,08,30
213,Lovely stay,"We had a lovely stay at Herbert park. Very comfortable room with nice touches such as Nespresso machine with selection of coffees and a box of chocolates. Good selection for breakfast. They clear away not long after 1030 deadline so don’t hang about. 
We are in The Bridge pub rather than the restaurant. It’s just on the corner in front of the hotel with nice menu and good atmosphere. Decent alternative",4,2019,08,27
213,"Yet another wonderful stay at Herbert Park Hotel, Dublin - We love it .....","Hotel is situated in Ballsbridge, a lovely suburb of Dublin within very easy reach of Dublin City Centre being a short taxi ride or bus ride away. Bus stop into City just beside hotel outside the US Embassy.  Also regular coach to Dublin Airport. 

My mother & I have stayed here several times and prefer to stay here rather than the city itself as Herbert Park Hotel is lovely, modern, spotlessly clean, comfortable with friendly staff and beautiful outlook over Herbert Park. It has the added bonus of being across the street from the famous Roly's Bistro restaurant.

Breakfast at the hotel is brilliant, well cooked, hot and tasty.  

The rooms at the hotel are clean, well maintained and airy.  The lounge/bar area is stunning, very comfortable with a nice atmosphere, modern in style.   

The staff couldn't be nicer - Gerard (Reception), Genina, Dagmara and Jack in the bar and lounge areas are hardworking, attentive and kind and nothing is too much trouble for them.   

Egle (Assistant Manager) is very efficient, approachable and helpful.

We can't wait to return to this hotel and were very sorry to leave last Sunday.

213,RDS herbert park,"stayed at the herbert park hotel on 22/08/19 
was chosen ahead of other hotels in area ie clayton and intercontinental due to its pictures online and setting on arrival car parking was not easy rooms very dated no stand alone shower in 2019? drilling in room next to ours on either side around 10am was no signs of building works? paid on arrival for stay breakfast and parking to almost be charged by wireless chip
and pin the following morning €48 euro for breakfast again. hotel just feels rather old and overpriced clayton and intercontinental are closer a lot closer to rds arena
gets 1 star for not chargeing us 
€6.50 for room service the only highlight",1,2019,08,25
213,Relaxing in Dublin,"Helpful and friendly staff, trendy hotel, nice rooms, great beds.Breakfast, tasty food excellent service. Lovely location close to Herbert Park. It can be busy at times but there always seemed to be extra staff appearing when required and it all added to a feel good atmosphere in the bar. Crumble is excellent!",5,2019,08,22
213,Clean and Modern Hotel in the Heart of Ballsbridge,"I booked and stayed last Sunday evening. I arrived a little bit early on Sunday afternoon and was pleased to be given the pass to my hotel room before the official ckeck in time of 3pm. On entering the room I discovered that there was a lot of building scaffolding ( iwas aware that these type of works were going on before I made my decison to stay here). As it was Sunday there was no works going on. In truth on Monday morning there was only a minor presence of builders around and I didn,t consider the works to me much of an intrusion on my room. Only when it was approching midday (time to check out) the the lound sounds of drillling etc began to ring out. As the Herbert Park Hotel overlooks the park of the same name to the rear it was great to be able to stroll out of the Hotel and walk around the corner and into the Big Grill Festival (Showcase of BBQ Foods and Craft Beer in Ireland) which was taking place that day. 
  Back in the hotel itself the feel of the place is Very Contemporary. The lobby is big and airy leading to a Bar and Resturant area (all very modern, clean and sleek).
  The only food I consumed there was breakfast which was very tasty ( i wish the savory food there was warmer). It is a pity that this place does not have more in the line of leisure facilities (i.e. the preasence of a swimming pool). Otherwise I am pleased to have stayed here for the one night.",4,2019,08,20
213,Beautiful well maintained hotel,"We stayed in the herbert park hotel while attending the big grill festival,The entrance is very impressive with lots of seating.  
 On arriving at our bedroom the impressiveness remained , clean,roomy,and everything one would need (even an umbrella) 
 Breakfast the next morning did not let us down , large selection (even gluten free)",5,2019,08,19
213,Fabulous,We had such a wonderful time in this fabulous hotel. Unfortunately we had to cancel the previous week due to a family bereavement . Although this was not in the 24hour cancellation period the hotel was extremely accommodating and rescheduled our visit without any cost. The staff could not be more friendly and helpful and the rooms are really lovely and comfortable . The breakfast is second to none. This hotel is truly wonderful and we will definitely be back. Thank you ,5,2019,08,16
213,Stena Line Dublin Horseshow,I had the beautiful opportunity of staying in the ‘Residence’ in the Herbert Park Hotel and I was overwhelmed with the amazing facilities offered within this room within an amazing hotel - I will definitely be back.,5,2019,08,12
213,Excellent stay,"I booked the Herbert Park Hotel via Andrea in group bookings for a group of 19 business colleagues. Andrea was very helpful with the booking and gave me all the information very quickly and made it all very easy for me.
Our stay was excellent and I have only received positive feedback. The rooms are spacious and provide all amenities one expects of a 4 star hotel. The team was also very flexible providing early check in and cancelling a room last minute. Thank you so much and I will certainly keep you in mind for my next stay in Dublin.",5,2019,08,02
213,nice hotel,"1 night stay here on Saturday 20th July. Nice spacious room, clean and well equipped. Staff very friendly at breakfast and check-in/out. Great choice for breakfast. Overnight parking for 21 euro. Nice coffee making facilities in the room.",3,2019,07,23
213,"Lovely hotel, but construction is very noisy at present!","This is a lovely hotel, located next to Herbert Park in Ballsbridge, in a nice and quiet area. The only issue we encountered was the incredibly noisy building work going on, with very loud banging and drilling waking us early one morning when we had been hoping for a lay in after a very late night out. We kept our curtains closed the whole time as there was scaffolding, with workmen on, literally right outside our window. 

Apart from the above, we thought the hotel was great. We booked directly via the website as this offered the best price at the time of booking. Breakfast was fantastic, with smoked salmon, scrambled eggs, bacon, sausages, cooked tomatoes, fried eggs, hash browns (delicious), freshly squeezed orange juice, smoothies, pancakes... the list goes on!

It is relatively easy to reach from the airport. We booked Aircoach bus 702, and the stop we needed was RDS (Ballsbridge). The bus driver was very helpful, getting off with us to retrieve our luggage, then pointing out to us exactly where we needed to go. The locals were very helpful and the taxi drivers offered us a few good pointers. One thing to watch out for is taxi drivers who are not Irish, as we almost got ripped off by one. We knew he was taking us a much longer route back to the hotel one night, and we immediately stopped him and got him to take us the right way returning his meter back to 'start'. It was evident he knew exactly what he was doing, and was just trying to up our fare. One Irish taxi driver told us this happens quite a lot with non Irish drivers. That said, we did on another occasion have a non Irish taxi driver who was perfectly nice and honest. Just something to be a bit wary of is all.",4,2019,07,22
213,"Stunning architecture, great room!","This modern hotel is brilliantly located next to Herbert Park in Ballsbridge with its stunning colonial architecture, and had wonderful airy, contemporary lobbies and dining area.  The room was cute, well appointed, clean and had two slightly small twin beds.

The only issue with this hotel was the vast surrounding scaffolding and building works, which woke us abruptly at 0800 with loud banging etc.

The hotel staff were wonderful and couldn't do enough to compensate, giving us a free breakfast (the best we had in Eire for our entire stay - really delicious), and helping us out in any way they could.

This is clearly a temporary issue, and if you're a corporate person or early riser clearly not an issue.  Great hotel.",4,2019,07,20
213,Nice hotel ,"Really friendly staff, hotel very clean, recently updated we stayed for 3 nights and really enjoyed it ! 
Would go again , a few good bars and bistro s within walking distance ! 15 minute bus or taxi ride into centre of Dublin 
",5,2019,07,19
213,Amazing comfort,Although this hotel was a little further out from the centre of Dublin than I would have liked there is nothing else I can criticise about the Herbert park hotel. The beds were wonderfully comfortable and everything was clean and tidy. Check in did include a 100 euro hold on my card for possible expenses during our stay which I was not expecting but otherwise the staff were friendly and helpful. Lovely place to stay. ,5,2019,07,15
213,Not what it was,"I have stayed here 3-4 times previously and recommended to people also as its in an  excellent location. However stayed last week and was fawlty towers, paid top $ for a room on sat night and put in a room with 2 singles put together after requesting double, room was facing direct into scaffold and zero view. Next night had to move as had kids and specifically asked for a room with no constrtuctin. following morning woken at 7 with drilling outside. Complained at the desk and told there was no construction outside our room!! He verified there was and apologized. Had to move again (3rd time in 3 days) as drilling continued while tried to put kids to sleep in afternoon. Ordered toasted sandwiches that night and was like something would get on aeroplane. Didn't charge for them but we didn't eat them. Would not recommend staying here until construction is over. They didn't mention construction was ongoing when I booked either",3,2019,07,12
213,Miserable construction,"We stayed at Herbert Park for four nights. Our first impression was a nice, quiet hotel away from hustle and bustle of Dublin City Centre. There was a note on the desk along with a box of complimentary(?) chocolates apologizing for some construction during our stay. The staff was friendly and our first two nights were without complaint considering we were up and off the property by around 6:00 AM for tours and didn’t return until late evening. 

The third morning, we were quite unpleasantly awoken at 8:00 AM by what I can only describe as the sound of bowling balls being repeatedly dropped on the ceiling directly above our heads. This went on, along with accompanying grinding, hammering, etc at an unimaginable volume until we left for the day. We also could not open the room darkening curtain because there were construction workers directly on the other side of the window. Charming. We had an identically miserable experience our fourth morning.

Unfortunately I booked our stay months ago before the construction started and the reviews were all glowing. I do believe that this would have been a 4 or 5 star review had the construction not been involved. 

TLDR; If you enjoy sleep and/or privacy during your hotel stay, look elsewhere. ",1,2019,07,12
213,Afternoon Tea at Herbert Park Hotel,"Although website says it's not necessary to book for Afternoon Tea, when I phoned to make general enquiries, I was told I had to book. Disappointed initially that our table didn't have any of the 'spectacular views of the 48 acre Herbert Park' described on the website, we asked could we move and Restaurant Manager Sarah and Joe moved us, and looked after us extremely courteously and efficiently; all staff were welcoming and friendly. We had a lovely afternoon but I hadn't realised (although I now see that's on the website too) that the Hotel charged for car parking - we were legitimately parked in a Disability space as my guest has mobility difficulties. Reception staff noted my horror at being told parking was an extra €9 and kindly reduced that for me. Thanks for all the assistance.",4,2019,07,11
213,unexpected building works,"Disappointed that our bedroom window showed workmen, a large dead plant (poor plant) and debris, with accompanying noise. So we kept the curtains closed throughout. Surely the hotel should have mentioned this when we booked? On the plus side, the coffee machine was a winner.",2,2019,07,10
213,Hotel under renovation,"The hotel is under renovation so expect to see a construction site sight from your side with the corresponding noise in the morning. Alternatively you can get the court side but then you will enjoy the traffic...
Also make sure you select breakfast included while checking in otherwise they will charge you a ridiculous 17€ for a cold buffet. 
Finally the waitress refuse to give us a nice table  by the windows arguing there were occupied. Reality is those tables stayed empty for the 30mm we spent at breakfast i.e. she could not be bothered.
Next stay will be at the next door Intercontinental. 

L’hôtel est en rénovation donc soit vous aurez la vue sur un échafaudage avec le bruit qui va avec le matin. Sinon vue sur la rue mais nous aurez alors le plaisir d’entendre les voitures. 
Prenez l’option petit-déjeuner sinon il vous sera facturé 17€ pour un buffet froid. 
Pire nous avons demandé un table avec vue sur le park mais la serveuse a refusé sous prétexte qu’elles étaient occupées. Au final elles sont restées vides les 30mn de notre petit déjeuner. 
Autant allez à l’Intercontinental qui est juste à côté. ",1,2019,07,10
213,Conference Meeting,"Herbert Park Hotel hosted our recent EMEA meeting. With over 150 guests the hotel catered for all their needs and requirements with excellent efficiency and a smile. The staff were nothing short of superb, the food was excellent and the rooms were all extremely well turned out. Breakfast was top notch each morning and conference facilities were excellent. Will certainly recommend hotel and venue again.",5,2019,07,09
213,Vacation in Dublin ,Excellent hotel next to Herbert Park and close to the US Embassy. About a 20 minute walk to city center. Staff was friendly. The breakfast buffet had a nice variety of foods. Close to some nice restaurants and pubs. Located in the “higher” end of Dublin due to the amount of Embassy’s. ,5,2019,07,09
213,Family gathering,The room smelt of cigarette smoke and was small with building works outside the window. When staff advised of the very strong smell they sprayed air freshener. It’s expensive great location but more for business than family.,2,2019,07,07
213,Very clean,"The breakfast is the best I have ever had at a motel. Fresh squeezed orange juice, great pastries, eggs, sausage, five kinds of fruit, salmon, four kinds of bread, strawberry/banana smoothies and great service !! Wow!",5,2019,07,07
213,On Speck,We have dined at the Herbert Park Hotel during June 2019 this included a late Breakfast and several evening meals. All delicious freshly cooked food. Its a place we like going to due to its spacious Lounge and Dining room its relaxing atmosphere and its ever friendly staff. The selection of Food is wide ranging with Fine Dining and Tasty Lounge Food. We can highly recommend it for leisurely afternoon /evening eating.,4,2019,07,04
213,Poor servive,"Rang the hotel and booked a table. Absolutely no issue, clearly stated we wanted a table in the bar area. Arrived into the hotel, bar was full. One table reserved. In my innocence I presumed it was for us. Told one of the staff that I had made a booking. She continued serving people and let us standing in the middle of the floor. 
Went to another girl who brought us into the restaurant. I told her I had a table booked in the bar. She told me that they don’t reserve tables in the bar and that we couldn’t have the bar menu in the restaurant. I told her that one of the tables in the bar was reserved & she informed me it was for the owner!!!!! She was not a particularly nice girl, in fact she was quite rude. She said who ever took the booking from me didn’t understand what I was looking for. Where is the rule that the customer is always right??? She made absolutely no effort to accommodate us & just walked away. ",1,2019,06,30
213,"Fabulous hotel,","We had a twin room and I have to say the beds were very very comfortable, I did however find a stain on the underside of my duvet cover, but being 1am it was too much hassle to ask for a change. The bathroom was slightly lacking in toiletries, only 1 of each, with a double occupancy room? It's not as though it was a budget hotel! Bar was pricy imo, €9.80 for a g&t! Staff were very friendly and accommodating and proximity to the RDS can't be beaten!",4,2019,06,19
213,High standard once again,"As always this is a well appointed hotel next to the tranquil Herbert Park and yet only a stones throw from the RDS and a 25 minute walk into central Dublin.
The hotel has good dining and the staff are always on hand to make sure everything about your stay goes smoothly.",5,2019,06,17
213,Bon Jovi,"We went to this hotel to watch the Connaught final before going to the concert and we really enjoyed a few drinks and some food , it was a busy spot with lots of people coming and going but nevertheless relaxing , a waiter served our every need with no fuss and extremely polite and we will definitely visit again possibly to stay this time",5,2019,06,17
213,Concert stay over ,"Rooms were very clean and spacious, staff were more than friendly. Rooms had coffee facilities tv and hairdryer, there was secure over night car parking. Hotel excellent for stay over for concerts in the RDS short walk away and bars and food close by.",5,2019,06,17
213,Lovely visit to Herbert Park Hotel,"We had a lovely 2 night stay at the Herbert Park Hotel whilst attending Fleetwood Mac Concert at RDS which was just across the road from hotel.
We had a lovely room. Very clean with nice touches - bottled water and chocolates every day of stay.
There was however some building work going on outside the room.
Staff were sympathetic and included breakfast for us.",4,2019,06,15
213,No response whatsoever ,"I am writing this very reluctantly. I try to avoid bad reviews and try to review for praise alone. Moreover, I am posting this having had no responses to 3 emails to the assistant general manager, the general manager (at 2 email addresses , so one must have got to them) This above all from a hotel such as this very poor. The Herbert Park is a very good hotel, and I would happily have given 5stars if the situation had been different were different but in these circumstances it really lets itself down. My comments are taken from my email. 
I thought I would also cut and paste what is on their website.

We are delighted to advise that we are currently improving the Hotel facilities and there is a possibility of noise in the Hotel during working hours while we complete this work.

This is very misleading. And would recommend you check every time when booking . Whilst there are delighted , you may well not be. I would suggest that if it was a similar experience to that of my wife and I certain rooms should not be let out. I am quite confident the noise limits would exceed that of the Irish HSA.

I have recordings if anyone is interested (about 7 various times of day)

Our story starts on Wednesday late afternoon when we checked in. We had requested on booking, if possible, a quiet room. We were not disappointed. We had 410, bright, roomy and overlooking the park . What we did not realise was that there was building work apparently right by the room . This went on until 19:30. On going down to eat we mentioned this at reception and the duty manager came and apologised profusely. 

We said we could accept this during normal working hours but not at 7:30 in the evening.

What we could not accept is what happened at approx 7:40 the following morning , where had 30 mins of intermittent grinding and sawing and drilling or it sounded like a mix of all three, of which I have 4 separate recordings  and reported this to another duty manager. At 14:00 my wife returned to the room to work . She could not do so she had to leave the room as  it was impossible to work plus make some calls . So she went down to reception with more recordings and worked until 16:00. The noise continued until  16:30 when a storm stopped the work. 
The following morning we were woken at 7:30 by more banging and clanging. We went down to breakfast and returned at about 9 to make a couple of last minute calls and to pack up only to find I could not be in the bathroom because of the level of noise ( more recordings)
I suggest that the noise levels way in excess of those as recommended by the Irish HSA. We checked out and once again discussed this with another duty manager Lara . We were given a discretionary discount of €150. I said that was totally unacceptable. If I was told on checking in that due to excessive noise we will a special rate of €150 we would have said sorry we will not stay . For this not to happen and still to be charged approx €275 it just completely unacceptable. I ask you would you pay that for a room that you could only time in during 19:30 and 07:30.
I know that apparently your colleagues do not know when and where the noise would be but that is entirely irrelevant. 
I do review on trip advisor but I only ever do so to praise (you can check my profile) and I am not making threats as that is a very negative approach but I am so sorely tempted as this was so extreme (I also know we were not the only residents to have the same experience).
We have travelled the world on business and please . We have come to dublin on business every year for the last 42 years and every type of organisation experiences problems , it is the manner in which they are dealt with is a true reflection of the organisation. So far apart from a lot of apologetic staff, this remains totally unacceptable.
When I checked out I told Lara that whilst I felt the offer was derisive  and unacceptable however I have never walked out of a hotel without paying and I was not going to start doing so. 
We won’t complain about the a/c that did not work on the Thursday night. Small concern in the circumstances.
",1,2019,06,15
213,Very Nice Hotel in Ballsbridge,I stayed here several nights at the beginning of my CIE tour of Ireland. It is a very nice hotel in the Ballsbridge neighborhood of Dublin. The room was very clean and comfortable. It is a long but enjoyable walk to the city center of Dublin. I recommend walking from the hotel into the city center and then taking a cab back. It is very easy to get a cab directly across from the main entrance of Trinity College. Herbert Park is right next to the hotel and it is a great place to go for an early morning walk. The breakfast buffet was very good with a lot of variety. I definitely recommend this hotel if you are looking for a place to stay in Dublin.,4,2019,06,10
213,"Spotlessly clean boutique Hotel located in upmarket area, beside beautiful parkland on edge of Dublin city.","This hotel is located on the edge of Dublin city. The prices are cheaper than city centre hotels. It is on a bus route, with very frequent bus service to the city. A walk to city centre might take 30 mins. It is located in a very upmarket area, and it has a very large park on its doorstep. So you are staying near the city, but you think you are in the countryside. The park outside is very beautiful. The hotel itself is spotlessly clean. There is lovely food available all day long in the bar/lounge, or you can sample some of the restaurants in the surrounding area. Some bedrooms have views on to the park, but you pay extra for these. The rooms are quiet, and a good night's sleep is usual.  The staff are also very nice and helpful. Breakfast is delicious. The hotel is located not far from the AVIVA sports stadium and is within walking distance of the DART, light rail which goes to the city centre or out to the seaside, if you fancy. I regularly stay in Dublin and I find this hotel to be the best value for this quality in Dublin. I find city centre hotels are too dear or too noisy.",5,2019,06,10
213,"Construction, drilling and zero compassion","Construction works were taking place with noisy drilling all day, room looked out onto scaffolding and workmen outside the window! No spare rooms available to move to, no compensation offered apart from a box of chocolates upon arrival. I was made to pay an extended room fee due on my checkout day after I had eaten something that made my stomach turn in knots - I was unable to leave the room due to being doubled over with the amount of stomach pain I had - the staff were very unhelpful and did nothing to assist. Not recommended.",1,2019,06,06
213,"Small rooms, VERY noisy due to building work!",The rooms were tiny. Some of our party didn't even have a kettle in. The refurbishments that were happening for a second year in a row were ridiculous. Started before 8am and carried on all day. Rooms had no views all looked out into scaffolding. Our only compensation was free breakfasts. Not really good enough.,1,2019,05,31
213,Great experience,great hotel a little out of the center of the town but very friendly and comfortable. breakfast is really delicious and staff is very friendly. some of the hallways could benefit from some repairs - especially the carpets. The price for a room is quite high and that explains the missing 5th star.,4,2019,05,26
213,Sunday Lunch,I had a very nice Sunday lunch there last week with my family. There is a good choice in the buffet. The staff are very friendly. The restaurant has a nice view over Herbert Park. We'll definitely be returning.,4,2019,05,18
213,Restaurant staff and restaurant manager.,"This review is based on how a situation in the lobby was handled. My family and I, who stayed at the hotel for 4 nights, brought food in to eat, while waiting for our cab to take us to the airport. We sat in the lobby, not restaurant. If you dont allow food, from outside, have it posted somewhere. This young girl working behind the bar came over to us, and basically told us we cannot have outside food in our hotel. If this girl would have approached us nicely and said, ""Hi, guys, im sorry, we generally dont allow outside food in our hotel lobby (which in itself is ridiculous), but just enjoy, and know for next time"", then fine. I get it. 

Instead, she had an attitude right of the bat, which made me get a little defensive. Two managers later, (all of which still had slight attitudes, and we were ""aloud"" to finish our very small amount of food (literally took us 10 minutes to eat. Gee thanks.

The rooms were pretty good (that's the reason there are stars at all, but I will never stay here again, based on the way they handle situations that are this small, and shouldnt be situations in the first place. They attempted to say as well, ""it's a European custom... it's not allowed in 4 star hotels.. blah blah"". I've Stayed in plenty of 5 star hotels, and I guarentee, they would have handled the situation (if it did arise) VERY differently. Maybe it's just a European custom for some to be rude.

The front desk staff was very nice and accommodating, but the restaurant staff, not so much.",2,2019,05,16
213,Perfect for last night in Ireland,"We spent last night of a 10 day trip touring Ireland at this hotel.  It was perfect, very clean, friendly, quiet in spite of construction near by.  We had a relaxing dinner in the lovely large lobby with a beautiful view of the park.  The trip to the airport the next morning took about 20 minutes.",5,2019,05,12
213,Lunch in the lobby,"Huge thanks to the team in the lobby and especially Dagmara for looking after our family and our great aunt so well and for delivering delicious food in a relaxed, warm and friendly environment.  You know us so well and are always so kind and know exactly what she needs!",5,2019,05,12
213,It was only OK !,"Stayed in this hotel last week , the hotel is really nice & check in was pleasant! However I  was awoken early the following morning to drilling & banging from 8am in morning. On check out looking a lot less business like than the day before the guy on reception didnt even ask if I enjoyed my stay! Basic customer service skills missing here!",3,2019,05,10
213,Beautiful hotel,The hotel is located right on a park.  The staff were friendly and efficient.  Well appointed bar with comfortable seats.  The restaurant overlooks the park.  The excellent breakfast buffet can be walked off with a stroll through the park.,5,2019,05,06
213,Excellent hotel,"Had a lovely stay here, the hotel is well located near to the RDS and a short ride from town. The staff were all really friendly and the room was clean and a nice environment to be in. The bar downstairs is also surprisingly nice.",5,2019,05,06
213,Family Unfriendly Hotel,"We have had lots of problems at this Hotel ; The checkin Experience is poor and during our stay there was constant drilling from 8am in the morning; Going to reception when asked when it was going to stop their answer was “September” ????

Room cleaning started at 8 50am and when we said we were busy it was if we were a problem

We had a 4 day old baby with us and bought some coffee and cakes to eat together; The manager decided this was a problem

This hotel is very family unfriendly and don’t book if you expect a good family experience",1,2019,05,03
213,Fantastic hotel!,I stayed here with my sister for two nights and we both loved it! The staff were super friendly and helpful and the room was spacious and clean. We would definitely recommend staying here when visiting Dublin.,5,2019,04,28
213,check in excellent,"we arrived early and greated by a very genuinely welcoming member of staff. beautiful macaroons  
allowed to check in early 
roooms since last time have been spruced up a little  though the pillows and duvet  were very  poor. no   spare pillows.
lovely chocolate left on bedside table and water in room along with lovely bathrobe.
have stayed her lots over the years andalways loved the breakfast and  was i disappointed.
were down early  and not very many in room, shown to table in corner looking out at park through scaffolding,by not so friendly staff member.
went up to help myself from buffet. at first glance lots fof fresh fruit  but when actually saw the fruit  it was not so great.
the irish breakfast used to be lovely with great bacon and what a disappointment.
either very greasy streaky  and beside it very greasy  not sure what
i asked a member of staff if i could have some back bacon  and he went away to kitchen   cam out a couple of minutes later and walked past me.
i then a few minutes later went back up and asked another member of staff,  who was jsut as helpful
eventually  the same very tall memberof staff i asked firstly for the bacon  passed by our table  and i asked  and he siad""yeh  yeh yeh   yeh  its being cooked for you  "" ther was such an attitude with  his look of utter comtempt. 
my husband and myself looked at each other and decided  it would be a long time before we set foot back in the hotel again  as for one night treat we would go for their package that gave bed and breakfast and bottle of bubbly   that this was a very poor way to finish in the hotel.",3,2019,04,23
213,Super location - your home in the centre of Dublin,My wife and I stayed here for the night - we were going to a social event in a nearby location. The visit to Herbert Park Hotel was fantastic from the moment we arrived. There is a secure underground car park with a lift to the lobby. Ioanna greeted us at the reception desk and installed us in a lovely room on the first floor at the front of the building. The room was cold when we arrived but room service responded promptly to resolve the matter. The room was very comfortable - not huge but very well decorated and spotlessly clean. Getting back to the hotel late in the evening we had no difficulty getting back in and up to our rooms. Total silence despite the hotel being quite full. The  breakfast in the morning was varied and generous. All in all a delightful overnight stay. Certainly not the cheapest location but still good value.,5,2019,04,14
213,Perfect place for a Lunch,We booked the restaurant for a lunch for 40 people following a family funeral.  We were very pleased with everything.  The staff were helpful and easy to deal with.  We booked everything with the minimum of hassle.  The restaurant was a lovely quiet place to have such a lunch and in a beautiful setting overlooking Herbert Park.  there was plenty of parking and it was really accessible for people with mobility issues.  The food and service were great and we were able to take our time and reminisce about our relative for hours.  I would really recommend here for such an event - we were delighted we chose the Herbert .  Thanks,4,2019,04,10
213,Very disappointing,"A very disappointing experience.  Reception language skills poor, requested an iron to room twice, it never appeared.  Children running amok in lobby, elevators,  corridors and banging on doors and no signs of staff intervening.  I expected so much more, wont be staying there again. 😔",1,2019,04,06
213,4-star casual dining in a non-stuffy atmosphere,"I'm a regular at the Herbert Park for a pre-match bar food and/or post-match drinks, as it’s so convenient for both the RDS and Aviva. While the bar menu selection is reasonably typical fare, it is always perfectly cooked and beautifully presented. I love the little millionaire square and shot of ice cold water that comes with the coffee! 😊
The comfy couches and pull-up chairs mean that there’s always loads of space for friends to join. Dagmara and her colleagues are efficient in dealing with the crowds, while remaining very friendly and welcoming. Staff seem to have worked there for ages – always a good sign in a vibrant city hotel! I’m already planning my next visit!",5,2019,04,04
213,Great pre-match venue,"The Herbert Park is a great venue for lunch / drinks in the bar before matches or concerts in the Aviva or the RDS. The staff are excellent, particularly Dagmara! The atmosphere is relaxed and casual.",5,2019,03,31
213,Our Ruby Wedding Hotel,The Herbert Hotel was perfect in every way and exceeded our expectations. It is undoubtedly the best hotel we have ever stayed at we will definitely be visiting it again in the future. Every member of staff was very welcoming and the facilities were of the highest standard. Highly recommended. Ian & Jayne Smith,5,2019,03,31
213,Lovely stay a bit outside of the city,"The hotel room was nice and spacious and had ample options for breakfast. Check in was easy and fun (macaroons and whiskey upon arrival!). The hotel is a bit outside of the main downtown area (about 30-45 minute walk) which we also appreciated since it was much quieter. There is plenty around, food and drink, all within a few minutes walk.",5,2019,03,27
213,Good business hotel,"I stayed here for 4 nights due to business. Room was of good size, with comfortable bed. I loved Nespresso machine in the room and had a cup of great coffee every morning. Breakfast was 100% the same every morning, not changing at all, but still quite many choices. Location of the hotel is good, although not very central - at least 30 minutes walk to downtown. There are several restaurants and pubs nearby, which is very convenient. I would stay here for business again.",4,2019,03,24
213,50th Birthday celebrations,"Visited Dublin with friends and stayed here. Friendly helpful staff, good location with restaurants and bars. Comfortable rooms with big beds! Enjoyed the breakfasts! Definitely recommend a visit. Taxi about 10 mins to town and also good bus service.",4,2019,03,19
213,"Very good hotel, great for business","The hotel rooms are big and nicely maintained. The staff is super friendly on all areas I had to deal with them (reception, breakfast, cleaning staff, etc). The breakfast is awesome compared to other hotels I had in Dublin - the buffet is very rich and mega yummie! I was in another hotel for a couple of years but this one is really a recommendation worth!",4,2019,03,19
213,Superb Coffee & Very Good Casual Meeting location in the city,"I recently had to meet up for an early casual meeting in the city on 2 occasions and my colleagues suggested the Herbert Park Hotel.  I hadn’t thought of this venue before but realised that the location, with (expensive) parking, avoided having to go all the way into the city centre, at least if you’re approaching from the south side of the city.

I liked the ambiance of the lobby hospitality area which is vast and affords a reasonable level of privacy most days, which is completely different to my previous experience meeting up before going to the Aviva.

The best way to start the day is with an excellent cup of coffee, which I’m particularly fussy about.  The coffee served in the lobby is absolutely superb.  My Americano was served in properly heated cups (so rare), together with a glass of iced water along with a petit four and all served on a small silver tray.  Somebody in the Herbert Park understands coffee!

The waitress looking after us was very attentive and professional but I would have loved to see her smile occasionally while dealing with customers.

A proper coffee experience and although it costs €4.50 - it’s worth ever cent.",5,2019,03,04
213,PERFECT FOR BUSINESS,"I had a good experience during my stay at the Herbert Park Hotel. My room is small but clean. Nothing special for the design but everything is in the right place. The hotel is based in Ballsbridge, very close to the RDS Arena. The location is really good for moving around the city.

At the reception, Mr. Davide will support you and satisfy your requests to the fullest.",4,2019,03,01
213,Dirty Sheets,"I have been a regular guest at this hotel over for 18 years - great location, beside Herbert Park and close to town. In all of those years, I only had two complaints - poor food one evening and I was refused entry on another occasion to the public restroom with toddler in hand having stayed in the hotel for two nights previously. On a recent stay in December 2018, we had to be relocated to an alternative room as the triple room booked had a window-leak issue. I had no problem as we were all exhausted and we needed to get some shut-eye.  Unfortunately, to my horror, I found an alien hair between the sheets just as I was tucking the children into bed. I further investigated the bedlinen by pulling down the sheets and noticed alot of soiling at the footrest position on the bed. As it was quite late, I deferred the complaint to morning time at checkout when I discreetly mentioned it to the receptionist. She summoned the Duty Manager who expressed complete surprise and shock and requested if we were ever returning to make contact! Three weeks later, we stayed again at the Herbert Park Hotel and as instructed I emailed the Duty Manager to notify him of our planned stay. In my email, I requested to ensure that the bedlinen was spotless on this occasion which I should not have to do! I also had expected some token of apology for the state of the bedlinen on our previous visit. To my disappointment, there was nothing more than the management ensuring that the bedlinen and rooms were spotless and that was all! When I say spotless, the bedlinen was so fresh that it smelled of fresh air. This room was in such striking contrast to our earlier stay and there is no doubt in my mind that the bedlinen on my previous visit was dirty. This hotel is getting tired. Rooms need to be refreshed and the management needs to learn how to value their long term guests.  It is very clear that housekeeping has become sloppy and corners are being cut to save costs.  To add to insult, I was made feel very belittled when I asked if the Duty Manager had received our email and if some token of apology was being offered, in kind or gesture. I was met with a blank look as if to say the Duty Manager had never acknowledged my complaint in the first instance. Really appalling customer service. There are other better run hotels in the area. This hotel has become too expensive for very little offering!",1,2019,02,25
213,"Predominantly a business hotel , but still warm and welcoming","This hotel is aimed at business users , it is adjacent to the RDS conference centre , during an event the prices are high , too high for the ordinary traveller .
 But when there is not an event at the conference centre the prices return to more normal , in fact competitive for a 4 star hotel in Dublin and in reality it is both warm and welcoming .  

There High standard in room quality and cleanliness and a Nespresso machine in every room , nice touch . 

Food is excellent , you expect good and you actually get very good . 

One downside to the four start rating is the Gym is poorly equipped , they should close it or upgrade it , so plan for your exercise outdoors.  

I have now stayed here multiple tines , not been disappointed , the staff are both friendly and very knowledgeable about the surrounding area for travel and restaurant options  
",5,2019,02,25
213,3 travelers,"Very comfortable and clean hotel with gracious staff.  The location was near bus transportation to down town and near the dart .  Restaurants nearby and the park itself was great.  The room had fridge and excellent security.  You could only use the elevator with your room key to go up but could exit via elevator anytime.  (the stairs were limited to emergency use as an alarm would sound) Initially I thought that odd, the no stairs, but for security purposes, very effective.  I left a hand written note that the beds were fine, there wasn't a in room card to let service staff know they did not need to straighten or change bedding.  My personal note worked.  Very clean and the bathroom was great, with a counter that provided plenty of room for our personal care items.  Loved the convenient transportation options near by.",5,2019,02,22
213,Usual high standard,"Just spent the past weekend at Herbert park
Usual high standard of service for this top hotel
Staff first class helpful and friendly
Will be even better when the extension is completed
Hits the mark every time!!!

213,Terrible Customer Service with Booking,"I booked this hotel for a business trip, then needed to cancel for personal reasons well in advance - over a month.  When I tried to cancel, they wouldn't let me speak to anyone and said I would need to pay over $1000 for a service they weren't providing because the ticket was non-refundable.  I booked through Priceline so I had no idea.  I feel I got scammed and that other travelers should be warned about this prior to booking here.",1,2019,02,13
213,Solid hotel for business travel,"The executive room was comfortable, with solid, albeit old furnishings.  This gives it more character than a standard international business hotel, but one has to set expectations re: fit and finish.  

North American travelers will appreciate the presence of a socket adapter and surge protector in room--a nice touch.

The hotel gym is minimal with only a couple of machines.  

Breakfast is adequate but nothing to write home about, especially for the price.",4,2019,02,09
213,Very nice stay,"I stayed here last weekend and have to say my room was lovely. The only thing I missed was the lack of normal plugs apart from two beside the desk, a full length mirror and an iron. We had dinner in the evening in the lobby and it was lovely but quite pricey. Breakfast was disappointing, as most of the food was cold. Overall, its a nice hotel but still room for slight improvements.",4,2019,02,05
213,Ideal Location,"Recently stayed in the Herbert Park and had a really enjoyable stay. Large spacious room, lovely breakfast & a special mention to Dominic on reception, keep up the good work! The highlight of this stay was it's location, lovely restaurants & bars nearby and everything is walking distance! I would return.",4,2019,01,29
213,Very comfortable stay,"Easy check in. Well appointed, very comfortable room. Superb breakfast. Great location. Friendly staff. Great location to get to everywhere and has parking on sight. Definitely recommend and is now my go to hotel in Dublin.",5,2019,01,28
213,Christmas Party Sleepover,Room was lovely. Bed was divine. Stayed over with work colleagues as party was elsewhere.Reasonablt priced as triple room.Didnt have breakfast so can't comment. Did have lunch which was delish but over priced but hey it is 4star so expected that. Staff very friendly. Parking is a pain to find not easy on such a busy part of Dublin. Definitely would stay again.lovely treat.,4,2019,01,12
213,Generally OK - but not of the standard I would expect,"Room was perfectly clean and as would be expected. Comfortable bed and nice cotton. Gym equipment was old and in the case of the running machine, broken. And EUR20 for a cold Irish Breakfast from the buffet? C'mon.",2,2019,01,09
213,Happiness in the Herbert Park,"For the past 3 years my partner and I have travelled to Dublin in the busy Christmas period and each time we stay at the Herbert Park. Not only is the location second to none, but the service by Ewan and his staff is professional, helpful and flawless.
We would not hesitate to recommend the Herbert Park to anyone visiting Dublin, both for business or pleasure - it caters perfectly to both.
The breakfast buffet is superior to any other I have seen and the facilities are also premium.
The room itself is spotless, contemporary and has all of the conveniences you would require when staying away from home.
We will be back this year!",5,2019,01,08
213,Great New Years Eve at Herbert Park,My family and I stayed st the Herbert Park on New Years Eve 2018/19. We would find it hard to say anything negative about our stay. Reception staff were extremely helpful and friendly (thanks Dominic). Our rooms were clean and very comfortable. We chose to walk in to the city centre and it took about 35 minutes. Breakfast on New Year’s Day was very good too. The choice of fresh fruit was great!! Thank you for a lovely visit! Highly recommend. ❤️,5,2019,01,04
213,What a great spot to stay,Absolutely lovely weekend at the Herbert Park Hotel with our family. Topped by watching a terrific game of Rugby walking distance from Hotel. Incredibly easy to catch #4 bus into city centre. Staff helpful and friendly and rooms comfy. Will be back and thanks for a great visit.,5,2019,01,02
213,Lobby Food and Service,"Having visited a number of top hotels around Dublin centre over Xmas 2018, Herbert Park in Ballsbridge has a very good functioning lobby for food throughout the day. Everything that was served up was well cooked, hot and well presented. The service was excellent especially Dogmara, shout out to you, who was most welcoming and ensured that everything was done right. Thank you. Herbert Park beat hands down The Westbury, The Radisson in Stillorgan and please never go to the Royal Marine in Dun Laoighaire more like a nursing home serving food that would not be dished up to your dog, (if you have one)",4,2019,01,01
213,Home to Dublin for Christmas,"Most years I visit my family in Dublin for Christmas or New Year. I live in Australia so its a long trip, I’ve been staying at the Herbert Park Hotel since 2002 an its very familiar and feels like home away from home. The hotel is very well laid out and is always spic and span. The rooms are very well equipped and up to date with decorating and furniture. This year I stayed in a park view executive room which is very spacious with bathrobes, espresso machine and daily newspaper. The food is great in restaurant and room service. Staff are outstanding, very professional and friendly. Location is wonderful with Herbert Park right there and a short walk to Sandymount strand. Buses, taxi’s stop right outside and its a lovely 40 min walk to Grafton Street. There are great pubs across the road (Crowes,Mary Mac etc) as well a grocery shop and restaurants. If you want a bright, modern and family friendly hotel just outside the hustle and bustle of the city then Herbert park is the best! Great job to mamangement and staff! BR (Melbourne, Aus)",5,2019,01,01
213,"Brilliant Place, Brilliant People","I have stayed in this hotel on a number of occasions both for business and with my young family. It is not just my favourite hotel but a favourite for the whole family.  Needless to say the property itself is located in a lovely area and is of a very high standard finish but it is the staff that make this hotel a truly great place to stay. From the Manager to the front desk, bar and restaurant staff to the room staff, everyone goes out of their way to make you feel that they genuinely appreciate your business and that you are very welcome at the hotel. This is a hotel that understands that all of the small things make the big things happen. I cannot recommend it highly enough.",5,2018,12,26
213,"Nice hotel, great location",Stayed here for one night with my wife for a Rugby match. Perfect location within walking distance of the Aviva stadium. Staff were very friendly and helpful. The hotel was spotless and the room was very comfortable. Only drawback was the ridiculously priced restaurant and the bar seems to be plonked into the lobby and didn't look very comfortable or inviting. We avoided both ,4,2018,12,17
213,Christmas overnight stay,"Stayed here last night , the hotel was immaculate, my only criticism is there are no tea making facilities in the room there is a coffee machine but what about your visitors that only drink tea, and also  my husband smokes but he couldn't find his lighter and we asked a couple of staff for a match or lighter but they were of no help what's so ever maybe you could have complmentry matches for your visitors just an idea just to save any embarrassment. ",4,2018,12,16
213,Enjoyable stay,"One downside - there are building works going on at the moment at the back of the hotel. It won't disturb your sleep unless you are sleeping during the day. My opinion is that we should have been told in advance and it is cold comfort to be offered  a box of chocolates thanking us for our understanding, when it is too late to do anything about it. That said - they managed to move us which was very obliging of them. Prices are definitely very high but probably typical for Dublin.
On the positive side this hotel offers a real personal touch. When we arrived the entire ground floor and restaurant had been taken over by a Christmas party. Nonetheless the staff found a way of providing a [very good] meal and a quick turn around to allow us to keep an appointment. Outstanding, friendly, obliging and unflappable are the best words for the treatment that we received. Similarly the reception and bar staff were great. The rooms are well maintained and very clean. The location is superb - for the city centre (5-10 minute taxi ride, or 30 minute walk) - or anywhere in the south eastern suburbs. The park next door is a joy for walking or exercising. Breakfast is superb offering a very wide choice of fresh and cooked food.",4,2018,12,15
213,Perfection in a hotel!!,"I have visited this hotel on a number of occasions, for different reasons. .Most friendly and helpful receptionist ever, so lovely and great first impression of hotel. 
The restaurant staff were just lovely and the food was amazing
I was very pleased with my stay, and although short and sweet this time, I have every intention on returning every time I go to Dublin.",5,2018,12,12
213,Hygiene of waiters,"HI. Recentley I have visited your restaurant to have a breakfast with a friend of mine. The buffet set up and the food was fabulous. However,  my friend and I had a problem with the hygiene of some of your waiters which we could smell from a far. They stunk of cigarettes which wasn't very pleasant. Also I wish that the dining room area had some music to add some ambiance . This is the first hotel that I visited didn't have any music on . I do travel extensively and I stay in 5 or 4 star hotels on regular basis .",4,2018,12,11
213,Wonderful trip as usual,"My husband and I have just spent 3 nights in this hotel and we’ve had yet another wonderful stay. We’ve stayed in numerous hotels in the city 4/5star but from check-in to check out Egle’s (hope I’ve spent it correctly!) staff and colleagues make it a unique experience. They have a subtle yet friendly approach and always make us feel valued, particularly from Siva and his team in the breakfast room.  This hotel is convenient to town is immaculate and friendly and we would highly recommend it.",5,2018,12,10
213,The Heart of Dublin,"I recently spent 4 days at the Herbert Park Hotel in the Ballsbridge area of Dublin.  This was a business trip and the hotel was in the perfect location for access to our meetings and briefings. Upon our early arrival overnight from Miami, we were greeted by Davide at the front desk who found us a room so we could shower, change and nap.  This was an unexpected surprise and so welcomed.  From that moment forward, every experience - from the large, spacious rooms to the amazing breakfast was first-rate.  Whether a leisure traveler or business trip, this is the right spot for all!  Way to go Herbert Park and team!",5,2018,12,09
213,Fully Recommend!,"High quality hotel set in ideal location. Very welcoming staff, relaxing foyer and lovely evening bar area with quality snacks and meals. The breakfast was the best we’ve ever had!! Rooms were clean and comfortable. Can’t wait to visit again, thank you for a wonderful weekend.",5,2018,12,06
213,Reception,We were greeted by a lovely receptionist called Davide who was extremely helpful and polite. I had to change our booking details earlier in the day and he put me at my ease straight away forwarding on the necessary forms and was very helpful upon our arrival.,5,2018,12,02
213,Avoid the bar,"I had a cosmopolitan that cost €14 and had almost no alcohol in it. No drink mat, no napkin, no bowl of nuts, nothing - cocktails are the same price as the Westbury which is a much much nicer hotel - but not half as good - complete rip-off  - wouldn’t visit the bar again.",1,2018,12,01
213,Good location,"The location is good, abutting the park, and certainly walkable to many restaurants and the center.
The lobby is attractive, and the rooms are adequate and clean. The staff is very nice.  They are doing construction next door plus the hotel was also doing construction which starts early and is extremely annoying...that the hotel “chooses” not to disclose this to their guests is telling.
For a four star they do not provide slippers or robes, they did not provide us with a full set of towels...only one hand towel. The bathtub/shower combination is too high and a safety hazard.",3,2018,11,29
213,Great experience,wonderful..friendly and helpful staff.  They let us into our room early to accommodate our flight!  They also provided us with free coffee when machine pods got jammed.  And they came up almost immediately when we had a question about heat control.,5,2018,11,28
213,Heart of Ballsbridge ,"It’s been a few years since I’ve stayed at the Herbert Park Hotel - but it’s good to see that standards have been maintained! It’s clean and well kept, my room (though a tad small) showed no signs of wear and tear and was well stocked with complimentary tea and coffee. It also had a minibar. The shower was great with sensitive heat controls and the bed was comfortable. Well placed and convenient for the enclave of restaurants as well as the many embassies, the park, river walk to Donnybrook and both the RDS and Aviva. ",4,2018,11,27
213,Dominic made the stay great,"Greeted by Dominic and he was extremely pleasant and informative. Will come again as long as he is here. Room was clean and well appointed. Location is good but not downtown, so the stay is quiet. Thanks.",5,2018,11,27
213,A business hotel I’d gladly return to with my wife,"Attended a conference here. Conference food (salad starter and Thai red curry) really good. Waiting staff brilliant, good sense of humour, happy to fetch Guinness for us from the bar instead of wine.
Rooms very comfortable, had one overlooking the park. Underground parking on site.
Buffet breakfast nice.
Definitely recommend ",5,2018,11,10
213,Excellent hotel,"To us it has been the best Dublin Hotel experience ever with a very friendly and welcoming reception through Dominic. We were offered a very beautiful and quiet room.Within half an hour's walk, we were in the City Centre, there was also a bus line nearby.",5,2018,11,09
213,Beautiful Hotel,"Recently started a tour of Ireland at the Herbert Park Hotel.  They were magnificent!  Couldn't do enough to make our stay comfortable.  My room was spacious, comfortable and spotlessly clean!  Beautiful park to walk in adjoining the Hotel!",5,2018,11,07
213,Excellent stay,"We had a really nice stay at Herbert Park Hotel in early November 2018. We felt very welcome upon arrival and the room was lovely, big and clean. Lobby and bar is great too. Big breakfast buffet with lots to select from. Check in and check out was both done by Dominic who’s very helpful and welcoming. 

Journey into the city centre is quick with bus stops close by and three frequent routes that goes into central Dublin. Buses don’t run very late, but during the hours they do it’s easy to get in and out of the city centre.

Great stay and I can only recommend.",5,2018,11,06
213,Would definitely return,"This hotel is a great find. Good location in ballsbridge  near bars and restaurants. Rooms are spacious and comfortable. We booked an indulgence package. What really made the difference for us was the Prosecco and canapés, the breakfast in the room up til 12 next morning and a late checkout.  Staff are friendly and helpful. Only thing missing for me was bathrobes!",4,2018,11,06
213,Great Hotel ,Another Great Stay.... Great location... Easy Parking (€12 per night I think that’s fine) Very high standard of Service and Cleanliness (Spotless) Very Professional Front Office Staff. Maintanence works do start early (Drilling and Hammering) I understand works need to be done but should not Start before 10am however got me up for a very nice Breakfast this morning ( Breakfast finishes to early 10am !!! Try 10.30) Will most definitely stay again.,5,2018,11,05
213,Definitely worth a visit!,"This hotel has a lot of wonderful attributes... from its palatial lobby to its excellent breakfast buffet to its very clean rooms to its convenient underground parking.  We also have to give a plug for one of the most pleasant and helpful desk clerks that we have experienced in awhile... Gerald Kenny!

If you are planning to attend an event at Aviva Stadium, I would strongly consider this hotel.  It took about 5 minutes to walk to the stadium one morning.  The same can be said for a host of national embassies, such as the USA.  There is also a nice clustering of excellent restaurants & pubs, as well as a grocery store, coffee shop, etc., just across the street, which doesn't require driving or walking too far for those conveniences.

It is a very quiet, comfortable hotel in a largely residential-feeling neighborhood, unlike other Dublin hotels located in the urban center.  I was surprised that it only took about 20-30 minutes to get to the hotel from the airport.  But to get to the city center, visitors will have to take taxi or city bus (our taxi from St. Patrick's Cathedral cost about US$20.)

We did walk every day to Merrion Square to catch a Green Hop-On-Hop-Off bus, which was the closest location.  That took about 15-20 minutes.  We figured it was twice that amount of time to reach the Liffey and Temple Bar area.

All in all, we would definitely stay at this hotel again.  Its multiple amenities outweigh its ""relatively"" far distance to the city center.  But visitors need to accept that they will have a bit of a hike if they choose not to take a taxi.",5,2018,11,04
213,Great Hotel to stay in.,"Just back from a wonderful stay at the Herbert Park Hotel. It is expensive but a nice way to treat yourself. I got it at a great price due to Booking.com. The room was very comfortable and quiet, just the way I like it. I had one dinner in the restaurant which was very tasty but a little pricey. Service was top notch. Would recommend this hotel if you want to treat yourself.",5,2018,10,29
213,"First hotel on our trip to Ireland, and the best.","While we waited for our room to be ready we took a walk in the beautful park right behind our hotel. The room was very nice, large room comfortable bed and very clean. We went to a pub around the corner for dinner and enjoyed watching the game on large screen TV.
The food was excellent.  The breakfast the next day was wonderful! So much food.. Loved the silver tea pot on the table. This was the best breakfast we had in our whole ten days! I waz glad we stayed here two nights.",5,2018,10,26
213,Beautiful hotel but not during renovation,"Painting,hammering,drilling starts at 9 if they are doing renovations. Our last morning of a 12 day trip and I thought I could catch up on my sleep. Nope.  If the hotel wants to be of the five stars,it shouldn’t rent rooms next to or on same wing as painters and the paint smell.  I understand that upkeep and refurbishing needs to be done but do it so it doesn’t intrude on your paying customers",3,2018,10,25
213,Think for the desk manager,"
We have traveled many countries but the attitute of desk manager is the worst ever. She doesn t know how to behave customers and is prejudiced.

Moreover, the hotel is located near the center of Dublin, the staff is friendly. They love their job.",1,2018,10,24
213,Fantastic Hotel,"I have stayed in this hotel twice recently. A fantastic hotel to stay in. Front desk staff were lovely and the room was great too. Comfy bed. Breakfast in the morning was of a fantastic standard too.

Will gladly stay in this hotel again.",5,2018,10,22
213,Highly recommended!,"Everything about the hotel was exceptional, especially the staff who were so accommodating.  I was not feeling up to par after a long flight from the states and the staff did their best to make me comfortable while I waited for our room to be ready.  Special kudos to our wonderful waiter Romee, who worked with he chef to create a special dish for me for dinner, which was delicious.  Be sure to take in the adjoining park for a nice morning walk and the small farmer's market at the entrance on the weekend.",5,2018,10,18
213,A great hotel,I stayed at Herbert Park Hotel for a weekend and thoroughly enjoyed my visit. The room on 5th floor was spacious and clean. The quality of my bed was excellent - and I travel almost weekly and am very difficult to please at this regard. Breakfast was also good with plenty of choice.,5,2018,10,09
213,So Impressed!,"Loved everything about this place. The front desk staff was so helpful AND so much fun! Everything appeared to be new. The location is kind of on the edge of the action but to us that was a plus. Several options available, including bus to get anywhere we wanted to go.",5,2018,10,05
213,We will be back,"My husband and I stayed at the Herbert Park for 2 nights . We had never stayed here before as we always stay at the Clayton in Ballsbridge . The location of the hotel is excellent. We were able to walk to The Bord Gais Theatre,about 25 minutes and also into the city (we like walking) We ate in Rolys Café which is just around the corner.Parking was very easy at the hotel and the reception staff were very friendly. Our room was on the 4th floor ,very spacious, spotlessly clean but for an upmarket hotel such as this I felt it was a little dated. We had a wonderful nights sleep, the bed was very comfortable and our room was so quite . The air conditioning was very easy to regulate and our room stayed nice and cool throughout the night which I find is often not the case in a lot of hotels.
Breakfast...... I think 33€ for 2 continental breakfasts is too expensive, so it was around the corner for breakfast on the second morning. 
All in all we did enjoy our stay at the Herbert Park and we will be back.",4,2018,10,03
213,Terrific Stay,"The Herbert Park focuses on outstanding service and it shows.  We arrived from the States very early in the morning.  The front desk was very welcoming, even though our check in time was not until afternoon.  They offered coffee and a private area (conference room) with couches where we could rest.  They got us into our room at 10 am.  Our room was comfortable, the buffet breakfast excellent, and the hotel location perfect, with good pubs and restaurants within the neighborhood.  I highly recommend the Herbert Park Hotel.",5,2018,10,01
213,Enterprise Ireland,"Were invited to a forum in Dublin, we stayed here and were pleased with the whole experience.  The staff went out of their way to make us feel cared for. We had one night to make our own arrangements, because of the good experience we decided to stay another night, so worth the bit extra in cost to stay where we felt comfortable.",4,2018,09,30
213,Expensive but a very good location.  Comfortable rooms but beds a bit too hard.  Fire alarm / evacuation poorly handled.,"Herbert Park was more upmarket than most of our five other stays in Ireland, but the bed was probably the most firm and least comfortable of all.  We opted out of the 21Euro a head breakfast, having just paid 10Euro each at the previous four star hotel. Up to date and clean, modern hotel with a good location.  There was a fire alarm activation which ruined our night - not the fault of the hotel.  However the event was very poorly handled with minimum communication and quite a high level of confusion.  The hotel has a PA system but at no time was it used in the hour when we all milled around in the lobby and outside in our nightclothes.  There was every effort to avoid communicating with guests as presumably the hotel had trained nobody to handle and be up front in such circumstances.  The 12Euro car park fee was graciously waived by the hotel as a result - slightly parsimonious and if we go back to Dublin we will probably choose elsewhere.
Also we had specialist  medical equipment to plug in overnight and there are no standard sockets on the bed side of the rooms.  We therefore had to leave a long trailing lead over the bedroom floor, which we could and did trip over.  Next night we stayed in a Premier Inn at 1/3 the price and the basic room was comfortable and had twelve accessible three-pin electrical sockets!",4,2018,09,25
213,CONSTRUCTION,"When i called to make my reservation, I was told that my room would overlook the park. As soon as i checked in i herd noise of construction and i could see scaffolding outside my window. I called the front desk and they told me that they are cpmpleting some improvement works. There was no option to move room.

Next day the work started early",2,2018,09,24
213,First trip to Ireland,"What an amazing place! So beautiful! The staff is fabulous! There are great pubs within walking distance. A beautiful park right behind the hotel. There is a huge breakfast buffet every morning, a lunch menu and dinner menu, a huge space with couches to just sit and visit or eat or read. Great place!",5,2018,09,23
213,Fantastic hotel,"Love this hotel. The rooms are great, quite spacious with a comfortable bed. It has a nice feel. The staff are really helpful, and friendly. Definitely recommend it. Its not in the very centre of the city but not far from it.",5,2018,09,18
213,One night stay was fine,"My sister and were joining a Brendan tour of Ireland but choose to arrive a day early to give us a day to explore Dublin and have some alone time.  The Clayton Ballsbridge was the hotel the tour was starting was fully booked so our travel agent booked us here for one night as it was within walking distance to the Clayton Ballsbridge.

It’s a very nice, modern hotel.  The front desk personnel were very friendly and gave great recommendations on where to eat, drink, etc.  

The room was very nice, clean and comfortable.  Adequate toiletries, though finding the blow dryer was a challenge 😀!  There is a restaurant and bar and while we did not eat there we did have a few drinks at the bar.  The bartender was so nice, we felt very welcome.

My only complaint, this hotel is not close to Temple Bar or the City Centre, we had to take taxi’s to get to where the heart of Dublin, its kind of on the outskirts as I would put.  We were there only 1 night, but it was a fine stay.  I would stay again if necessity called for it, but would prefer to be closer to Central Dublin.",4,2018,09,16
213,Nice stay,"Me and my partner travelled to Dublin on 24 Aug for the World Meeting of Families WMOF2018  and to see Pope Francis. I chose the Herbert Park hotel as it was conveniently located opposite the RDS where the WMOF2018 registration and talks where being held and because the hotel had good reviews. I am not keen on small B&B's rather i prefer larger establishments so the Herbert Park ticked all the boxes. It looked  was modern, stylish and sophisticated.

Positives: the hotel itself was was really conveniently placed for us as we were attending the WMOF2018. The overall look of the hotel is impressive it is slick, modern and the lobby area is neat and tidy  with a business class feel. The breakfast has a good selection of hot and cold items. There is a buffet style hot section where you select your own bacon, eggs (fried or scrambled) sausages, black pudding and mushrooms. There is also a selection of bread, cereals, danish, and pancakes. There is also a menu if you wish to have your eggs poached, or as an omelette or eggs benedict. We really enjoyed breakfast and didn't have a bad word to say other than that they could have had an extra toaster for the bread. 

Negatives: this is not the cheapest hotel in Dublin.. We paid £700 pound for a 3 night stay. We were looking forward to a nice view of the park as it is mentioned alot on the website however we got a room which was located in a square and we have scaffolding again the window as construction work was underway. We felt a bit cheated for the price we paid as we expected nice views. I think we we had not have been there for WMOF2018 and too preoccupied with events and excited about seeing Pope Francis we would have complained.. I certainly would have not paid the cost of the room under other circumstances for what we recieved. The free box of chocolates was a nice touch but didn't go half the way to make up for the room allocation and construction work. The hotel did not mention the construction work at time of booking nor was it mentioned on checking in which was disappointing as room rates should have been lowered....

The rooms themselves are comfortable.. Although they still could be made a bit more stylish. The annoying thing is lack of plug sockets next to the bed as there was none which made charging your phone annoying....

One downside to the hotels location is that there is not many places to eat or drink near the hotel.

Although the hotel is a great location for access to RDS and Aviva stadium it is a bit too far out of Dublin centre to walk to the major abstractions. This is not too much of an issue as you can hop on the number  7 or 4 bus which is located outside the US embassy. Be warned though you have to have the correct change for the bus as notes are not accepted. The fair is €2.80. Or you can pick up a 3 day bus pass or daily bus pass from the air port bus information desk. The bus ride is only 10mins and the buses run every 10 mins or so so you never wait too long.

To get to Dublin city from the airport by bus you can get the 474 from the airport to O'Connell Street and then jump on the 4 or 7 bus to herbert park. Ask for the RDS stop.

Overall the hotel is a nice little hotel if you dont want to be located in the hustle and bustle of the city centre. ",3,2018,09,02
213,"Nice hotel , far from city center ","It’s a nice quite hotel , walking steps from Herbert Park which is excellent for morning run , little bit far from city center and touristic attractions , food is ok not the best in town but ok , free WIFI

213,An outstanding stay!,"We recently spent three nights at this top class hotel and could not recommend it high enough. From the reception staff on our arrival of Dominic and Gerard the entire team at the hotel could not do enough to make our stay a pleasant one
The food in the bar is of the highest quality so well done to the chef while the terrace staff are welcoming ,friendly and very knowledgeable re the menu. Our evening server Dharman was particularly pleasant and friendly. The cleanliness of the hotel is of an exceptional quality and the hotel is ideally situated to tour Dublin City Centre. Over the course of our stay we had occasion to visit some of Dublin's iconic hotels but none could surpass the staff of the Herbert Park for the service they provide. We will return and well done!

213,Great Hotel,"Lovely hotel great location , staff really made our short stay very enjoyable.
Dominic on reception was extremely helpful and such a nice guy, made us laugh, with his jokes. The rooms are all very well furnished and very clean, great coffee machine .",5,2018,08,27
213,Great hotel,"Lovely rooms, fairly spacious. Slightly in need of some style and decorating updates. Really friendly staff. Good location (was near to office). Comfy beds, clean bathrooms. Need iron in room, and hairdryer was faulty. ",5,2018,08,27
213,Wonderful location in Dublin,"The hotel was located next to a beautiful park so it was very convenient for anyone wishing to indulge in a little exercise. The staff were extremely gracious, well informed & helpful. I particularly enjoyed the front desk personnel: Arijan, Davide & Dominic. Within a short walk you could find a variety of locales in which to eat or get on one of the local on/off buses. Beds were comfortable & the showers hot. A very pleasant stay.",5,2018,08,26
213,Very luxurius,"Enjoyed spending two nights here.  The hotel staff was very helpful dealing with a bus load of tourists.  The place was air conditioned which was pleasant considering Ireland hadn't had rain for over 40 days.  They also helped by doing some laundry for us, so we could continue wearing summer clothes, even though we had packed warmer wear.",5,2018,08,22
213,LOVELY FOOD,"Had a very nice afternoon meal in Terrace Lounge lately.  food was very nice and nicely presented.  Staff were helpful.  Pleasant surroundings and plenty of space.  We had soups, open sandwiches and desserts, all of which were very tasty.",4,2018,08,21
213,Amazing Hotel....,"My Husband & I stayed here & were hugely impressed by this hotel, very clean & modern, very friendly & helpful staff especially at reception and very helpful regarding restaurants in the area. Rooms have air conditioning. Another lovely touch was chocolates left in our room as they are carrying out renovations which was next to our room but thankfully didn't bother us as it was the weekend. Will definitely stay here again & would highly recommend",5,2018,08,19
213,A good average hotel,"We found the Hotel very pleasant and were surprised to find that there were only 3 Irish people on staff out of 90. However, all the staff were extremely helpful, friendly and professional. We had a problem with noise in our room, which is above the air conditioning plant, and after 2 nights we couldn't take it any more and they gave us another room, which was beautifully quiet.I want to mention their dining room",4,2018,08,17
213,Great Hotel great location,"Stayed for 2 nights really enjoyed our stay. Friendly staff, excellent breakfast,room fantastic. Our second time staying and looking forward to our next visit.",5,2018,08,17
213,Lovely hotel and fantastic location,"My daughter (9) and I stayed overnight and must say the hotel was great. Good standard of rooms, parking, great location but for us the best thing was the staff. They were so helpful on check in, in the restaurant and on any help we needed. Lovely breakfast, better than other hotels with the same grade. Will be back for sure.",5,2018,08,13
213,"Good Stay, Amazing Breakfast","Stayed here in July, cant really fault anything, the room was looking out onto a scaffold, but that didnt bother us, we didnt travel to look out a window. Aircon in the room was great, staff very polite and friendly, had a really good nights sleep. 
Breakfast was top notch, great selection of everything.",5,2018,08,13
213,Wonderful hotel and staff,"My daughter and I spent a total of 5 nights in Herbert Park hotel in early August. The rooms were fresh and comfortable and the bathroom was clean. I am one of those annoying holiday makers who always finds grime around the toilet bowl and mould in the sink. Seriously, it's amazing how often this happens! I went to Centre Parks not long ago, which is a 5 star luxury resort, and I had to ask them to clean the bathroom properly. There was dried toothpaste on the sink and black grime on the floor. I stay in quite a lot of hotels and I have become used to asking for the bathroom to be cleaned.

Not so at The Herbert. The bathroom was immaculate. They obviously have a very strict cleaning regime. It was reassuringly spotless. So too was the room: clean carpet, crisp white sheets and dust-free furniture. As for the biggest test - the television  remote - it looked brand new. No sticky grime or dirt. Phew.

The only issue I could find in the room was the curtains. They could've done with a good clean - though this was only an issue in the second room I stayed in (220).

I cannot write this review without mentioning the absolutely wonderful staff at The Herbert. Right from the start, Dominic on reception was the height of professionalism. I am yet to meet a better front desk attendant, in any hotel I have visited. Nothing was too much trouble and everything was done with care, consideration and...yes...charm. He certainly won my little daughter over! She couldn't wait to see her new best friend every morning! 

A special mention must also go to Davide, who was genuinely concerned when I lost my tablet, and even enquired later to make sure I had found it. Again, he was incredibly professional and offered the kind of service you would expect at a 5* hotel. Wonderful. 

I honestly feel as though I should be mentioning every staff member by name, they were that good. I didn't get the manager's name, but again, she was very charming and helpful and seemed to genuinely care about her guests (we had a large wedding party, and several of us commented on this). All-in-all it was a wonderful stay at a fabulous hotel. You gave us a traditional Irish welcome, which will be hard to beat!",5,2018,08,12
213,Everything was excellent.,"Huge spacious foyer, rooms were clean and spacious.Direct access to Herbert park which is adjacent to hotel.Clean spacious restaurant looking out at the park.Excellent employees. Computers available for use. The best breakfast hands down, we adored the Swedish Pan-cakes the most.Great access to post-office, restaurants(shout out to Sanuk-A great value and great Thai food.) Down-town was also very close to this hotel,we walked to every-thing.",5,2018,08,11
213,Great stay,We stayed here on Monday 6th August room 126. From the moment we checked in we had a lovely stay. Staff very friendly. Only criticism was bacon at breakfast was hard and inedible. Special mention to John who works nights very friendly affable guy who was very friendly to my wife and me when we came back from a family get together at all hours of the morning he deserves a special mention. Thank you to all for a lovely stay we will be back regularly. Mike and Mary.,5,2018,08,08
213,Good location; be aware of construction work ,"Stayed two night. Decent room and bathroom. Buffet breakfast was of a good standard and at €15.50 for continental and €19.50 for the full Irish, both were expensive. 
No mention when checking-in that there was major construction on site with the addition of a major extension. It only bothered us when we returned the second day in the late afternoon when there was a lot of jackhammer activity. God help anyone trying to get a late sleep in the mornings!
Hotel ranked very good with 4/5 but the lack of upfront transparency with the construction work showed a certain arrogance on behalf of hotel management. There were no visible notices indicating construction works or apologizing for any inconvenience caused. The final score reflects these shortcoming. ",3,2018,08,07
213,Beautiful,"The rooms were great and clean. The staff was the gem of this hotel. We arrived the first night in Dublin and did not have luggage for 4 days. They were extremely helpful in giving us directions on where to shop. We spent our first night of our vacation there. We accidently left our iPad, we called never thinking it would be found. Sure enough they called us back and it was in the room. We had already pre booked the hotel for our last night there. When we arrived and checked in, the first thing the gentleman said was, were have your property.",5,2018,08,06
213,Average Hotel,"Positives- Hotel is in the heart of Ballsbridge- great location to the Aviva Stadium and some great pubs /restaurants in and around.  
Reception and lounge area spacious and comfortable
Staff very helpful
Rooms clean

Negatives- Rooms need some TLC- Air con doesn't work properly( requested maintenance to fix- which didn't happen)- Had to request a change of room- the smell of smoke was too overpowering-  Huge construction work going on - never told about this and our view was a building site. 

Overall disappointing- this was a birthday present and family weekend away that you want to make sure is special- small things i know- but you would expect from a 4* establishment that the basic standards are met.",3,2018,08,05
213,Excellent Stay,"Herbert Park is a great location. I have stayed here many times in the past few months and found the quality and service to be consistently excellent throughout all of my stays. 
It is located in the heart of Ballsbridge with secure underground car parking. 
I would definitely recommend it",5,2018,08,01

213,Wonderful Hotel overlooking Herbert Park,"From the moment I checked in to the time I departed, the hotel and staff (in particular Dominic at the front desk) was welcoming and helpful. I would not hesitate to recommend this hotel to anyone. It was modern, clean, good facilities and within easy reach of the city centre by foot, bus or taxi. At the time of my stay, there is construction next door but the hotel left a note and a box of chocolates by way of an apology. However, there was no work being done over the weekend.",5,2018,07,31
213,Excellent stay,"Herbert Park is in a great location for sightseeing in Dublin. Some lovely restaurants in the surrounding streets. On a main access route into Dublin so hailing a taxi is no problem. 
The hotel itself is modern, clean and rooms are well appointed. Staff are very professional and very helpful. Dominic was a very nice, genuine and extremely helpful member of staff who couldn’t do enough! Thank you, I will recommend and stay here again any time I am in Dublin!",5,2018,07,27
213,Beautiful hotel on the edge of a lovely park,"We stayed for a week at the Herbert Park Hotel at the end of June/beginning of July 2018. We were very pleased that the management made our room available to us before check-in time as we were just coming off a 2-week commercial tour of Ireland. We were very alarmed at the construction noises. Upon speaking to the front desk about perhaps changing rooms, we were informed that the construction changed daily and another room might be fine today and worse tomorrow. So, we sucked it up, hoped for the best and it worked out fine. We were never awoken by the construction and things were blissfully quiet over the weekend.

We found our time at Herbert Park very pleasant. The breakfast was consistently good and it was possible to order eggs specially prepared which my husband did daily. The staff at the front desk were always friendly and helpful and the housekeeping staff worked around our schedule. We ate in the bar a couple of times and I agree with other reviewers, the staff was not as welcoming as others in the hotel.

We liked the location of the hotel, not only because of its proximity to the lovely green space but because an ATM and several restaurants and bars were within a short walk. We took cabs when we needed to get to other parts of Dublin and they were easy to hail nearby.

If we're ever in Dublin again, we'd definitely stay at the Herbert Park Hotel.",4,2018,07,25
213,Most Hospitable,"We stayed overnight July 2018 as we were taking a tour the next day for a couple of weeks.  The Hotel held one of our suitcases in store as we decided to travel lighter. At the end of the tour we returned for a couple of nights and collected the bag. Absolutely no problem there.
Modern Hotel. The rooms are most pleasant, spacious and with all amenities (though we hated the shower in bath).  The staff are warm, friendly & most helpful.  Great breakfast and the bar menu is excellent (didn't try the restaurant).  The Guiness is great :-)
The hotel is set within a park - no traffic, quiet and restful, although nearby there is an award winning restaurant and easy access to the Hop-onHop-off bus.
14 Euro taxi ride to town centre, though public transport is nearby.
Would always stay there again if we were in Dublin.  Thank you Herbert Park.",5,2018,07,24
213,Sure it'll be grand after the builders leave,"We stayed here for a few days to plan our city centre wedding, so we'd hoped to save some money to stay just a little bit away from town.  Well, the car park was very expensive and the traffic was mostly horrific in any direction.  The canal was being dredged so one night there was a horrid smell in the room... not the hotel's fault and I haven't marked them down for that.  I have marked the hotel down for not advising us of ongoing building works.  We arrived around 3pm and when we got to our room there was the extreme noise of concrete / iron beam drilling.  We stayed mid may, at that time it started around of just before 9, I expect it likely went on until 5.  Comfy, clean room, bathrooms a little tired and below par (we never take basic room).  Breakfast was very good, largely self service.  Nice enough park to have a short stroll thorough after.  I wouldn't revisit but neither would I tell anyone not to visit.  Lobby bar was cold and unwelcoming though, staff at the time had very little knowledge of bar work or fairly common drinks orders.  Complimentary nibbles though!",4,2018,07,22
213,Construction works a disaster! ,"We booked this as one night stay, attracted by it’s location and reasonable (enough) price!

First impressions were ample car park spaces, contemporary reception area. The bar was quite nice, the food looked good although we did not sample as we had other reservations elsewhere. Beware thought if booking and looking for an actual restaurant experience, the restaurant seemed to be just an area off the bar which in itself is an extension of the open plan lobby. 

Our room was clean, above average size for a decent hotel, bathroom quite small but sufficient none the less. Decor a little dated but all the modern amenities, safe, mini bar etc.

The room itself was adjacent to massive scaffolding which is in place due to a large renovation the hotel is currently undergoing, a fact we were never advised of neither on booking nor check in. The scaffolding so close to our third floor window that the curtains had to remain drawn for the duration of our stay to guarantee privacy. A small box of a Butlers chocolate and a generic note of apology were little consolation for the rather loud noise which began around 8.30 on a Saturday morning (hammering, electric sawing etc). This made it impossible for us to have our anticipated “lie on” post a busy week at work and night out on the town the previous night.

We complained at checkout, politely but firmly. The receptionist apologized, stating that works did not normally take place on a weekend. We countered that it was besides the point and of little consolation to us, we should have been informed of the possibility at time of booking/check in nonethless. Being honest, had we known prior to check in, we probably would have cancelled our booking and made alternative arrangements. We were offered complimentary validation of carpark ticket as consolation which we accepted. We didn’t taken things further given an already irate guest next to us shouting at the top of his voice over his inconvenience to another staff member, we did at least appreciate that it wasn’t actually the fault of the staff at this level. That said, if we had paid anymore for the room, I probably would have been just as irate (but never as rude).

Anyhow, I wouldn’t rule out another visit, once the building works are complete!! ",2,2018,07,21
213,Hotel Stay While with CIE Tour,Great location. Very clean rooms with comfortable beds. Staff is very friendly and accommodating. Breakfast is excellent. Rooms have AC and internet. There is a beautiful park directly behind the hotel where we have walked after dinner.,5,2018,07,20
213,Excellent business venue,"Very well looked after for our business meeting and great attention to detail especially from the catering staff and meetings staff. 
A very pleasant hotel stay and no complaints. Nice big room. 
One thing, I asked for an 04:30 taxi to the airport. The taxi was a big minivan. On arrival the driver refused to take a credit card and so I had to use an airport ATM and pay to use it. This is not the fault of the hotel, but did it impact my overall experience and make me wonder why the hotel books this taxi company? Yes.
Nevertheless nice hotel and highly recommended ",4,2018,07,19
213,Fabulous yet again,My wife and I with close friends spent a fabulous weekend in the Herbert Park. I have stayed there on quite a number of occasions and always had a great time. The hotel is beautiful stylish and maintained to a faultless standard. The staff are amazing. This visit proved to be no exception. Tip: the breakfast is a delight. The location is wonderful.,5,2018,07,18
213,Excellent as always,"Staying in the Herbert Park for business quite regularly, each stay is flawless. From being pleasantly ""welcomed back"" at the very friendly reception, the spotless rooms, the lounge to have a quick bite to eat to the high quality breakfast in the morning. Situated in a great area, with quite some bars and various choices of restaurants. Next to the beautiful Herbert Park and close enough to the city center. Favorite place to stay for me in Dublin.",5,2018,07,16
213,Beautiful Hotel in central location ,"I stayed 3 nights in the Herbert Park Hotel whilst attending a conference in the RDS. The room was very clean and spacious. I had breakfast included and there was a great selection of food including a cooked breakfast, cereals, pancakes and fruit.  Wi-Fi was available in the room. Room was cleaned daily. It is a 2 mile walk from The Herbert Park Hotel to Grafton Street. Public transport is also easily accessible. The hotel staff were very friendly and approachable and I really enjoyed my stay. I hope I can stay there again in the future! I would recommend this hotel for RDS and Aviva Stadium events. ",5,2018,07,14
213,"Stylish, modern hotel in a great location!","We loved this hotel from the moment we walked in the entrance. The lobby is very spacious, bright and airy and modern in style. Our room was gorgeous! A large, corner room (117) with huge dual aspect windows and a view over the park. The bed was very comfortable, we found the pillows a bit hard but that is the only negative I have to say! There is construction going on next door to the hotel but we knew about this in advance and asked for a room away from the construction. If you are in the hotel during the day you will hear it. However, if like us you are out exploring Dublin during the day then it won't affect your stay and as the hotel is next to the park it is lovely and quiet at night (no road noise). Breakfast was delicious and excellent quality. The staff were all friendly and very helpful. Ballsbridge is a lovely, leafy area of Dublin, just a short bus ride away from the centre. Also you can catch the Air Coach from the airport and after a 30 minute ride it drops you off very close to the hotel (ask for the RDS stop). There are plenty of local restaurants too, we liked The Bridge and Al Boschett. Can't recommended this hotel enough and would definitely come back!",5,2018,07,13
213,Why has this hotel got such great reviews?,"The best thing about this hotel is the location. We were staying there as we were attending the Billy Joel concert at the Aviva stadium. Unfortunately we did not know that there were 2 other concerts in the area that weekend. I had read the reviews and being forewarned asked my sister who arrived before me to check that our room did not overlook the building work. The lady she spoke to said it did but the room would be changed. When I arrived & we reached our room the only view was scaffolding & builders. I went down & spoke to reception who had no knowledge of the request to change rooms & said that it didn't matter as the other rooms available did not overlook the park only apartments. We stayed where we were as a park view was what my sister wanted. They did leave us a free box of chocolates in the room as compensation. However we were not impressed. A little more effort and more substantial compensation would have been appreciated. The room was only okay. The bed wasn't particularly comfortable and as previous reviews said there were insufficient towels and the toiletries were basic for a 4 star hotel. The breakfast was expensive but a good variety. On the Saturday evening of the concert we tried to get a meal at the hotel. It was exceptionally busy and even as guests we couldn't get a table as we hadn't booked and trying to get a seat in the hotel lobby from where we could order food was almost impossible. We managed to find a free table eventually but when I got the attention of the only one waiter/manager running around he very rudely told me to sit down and wait. There was obviously not enough staff on even at the bar. I appreciate it was a busy weekend but for guests new to the hotel and the area they could have at least given us some indication of how busy it would get. The Friday night before the hotel restaurant and lobby was ""dead"" and we didn't stay for  drink as there was no atmosphere. I found the reception staff unhelpful except for Dominic who gave us excellent directions on how to get to the Aviva and remembered us the next morning and asked if we got there okay and put our bags away for us before we travelled. You need more staff like this young man. The manager in charge of the breakfast/restaurant was not the most helpful/polite of gentlemen. I felt as if we were being rushed through breakfast as he was waiting for us to pay and he was very unfriendly. He is also the same gentleman who rude to us the night before when we enquired about getting food. I wouldn't rush back to this hotel at these prices and it is really only 3 star.",3,2018,07,12
213,Delightful hotel ,"I was in Dublin for several days and after two pretty miserable nights at the ballsbridge hotel spent my last night here, just wished I’d stayed all 3 nights here...

Friendly staff, clean, new and very comfortable. The only thing missing was that it was a bit too “corporate” but I’d take it! In comparison made the ballsbridge hotel look awful and was actually cheaper than the outdated ballsbridge hotel. 

",5,2018,07,10
213,Great One Day stay before Cruise,"Stay here for one day before cruise. It is clean and comfortable. Breakfast was delicious. We had a good rest after a long flight from Toronto. We didn't able to make the Nespresso machine to work, it brew only the hot water. We were on the 2nd floor, but noise level is acceptable. We took a cab to the Guinness Storehouse and only cost us 13 e. ",4,2018,07,06
213,Absolutely Beautiful!,"Upon arrival we were greeted with shots of Whiskey!  The staff was very friendly and things were in walking distance.  The most amazing this about this hotel was how tour buses have to enter.... the entrance is very narrow and buses must go in reverse to enter.. I realize this is not a review so much on the hotel; however, I was just absolutely amazed at how our Driver, Jerry got us there!

The hotel's food was absolutely impeccable and we had 2 night's there and each night it was quite and serene.  This is not a party hotel (thank God) as we were jet lagged from the horrific United Flights over; however, walking into Herbert Park was wonderful!

If you're staying in Dublin and want quality - this is a great choice!",5,2018,07,06
213,Warm Irish hospitality,We stayed in the Herbert Park Hotel two of the twelve nights we were in Ireland and Northern Ireland. It was one of the two best hotels in which we stayed during our visit. It is located conveniently in the city with comfortable accommodations. We would recommend this hotel highly in spite of the construction work going on. They did their best for the construction work to not interfere with our comfort.,5,2018,07,05
213,Unexpected Surprise,"We have stayed on several occasions at the Herbert Park, but upon our arrival this time Davide and the team had a surprise in store...namely an upgrade to the fabulous Park View Suite!
Situated on the top floor with great views and an immediate sense of luxury. Spread across several rooms, including a bathroom large enough to require guided tours, with all the latest gadgetry. The hotel itself is only a twenty minute walk from the sites of Dublin, with good facilities and staff who go out of their way to be friendly and helpful.
We would have been re-booking this venue for our next business trip even without the upgrade but I must say we could get used to the delights of the Park View Suite.
As if by magic the sun also shined for all of our trip!
Many thanks to all the team at the Herbert Park and we will see you again.

213,Ballsbridge perfection,"This was a perfect location for us to begin our holidays.  Minutes from st stephen's green and the heart of dublin, but in the herbert park neighbourhood of Ballsbridge. The iconic Bridge Pub is just out the back door of the hotel and then just across Merrion Road is a good string of pubs and restaurants, an apothecary, banks, and everything else you'd need.  the hotel is clean and modern with many tv displays in the bar and lounge where we watched the world cup.  If there was one minus, it is the construction going on next door.  It's temporary for sure so we did not deduct from an otherwise ""excellent"" rating.   We will certainly be back here to stay.",5,2018,07,03
213,Very good hotel : Great Location,"Excellent hotel in a great location. Herbert Park is a very nice part of Dublin 4.

Check in was very quick and the reception staff were very friendly and helpful.

Room was perfect, good wifi and everything you would need in a hotel room.

Really good - Recommended",4,2018,07,02
213,Work BBQ,"We had our annual work BBQ in the hotel last night and we were so well looked after by all the staff at the hotel , terrific food and lots of it and staff were amazing. Lovely venue for a night out in the city .",5,2018,06,30
213,The Killers. RDS Arena. Perfect Venue for the stadium! ,"We stayed here for 2 nights end of June 2018. The hotel is primarily used by business men & women and in fact an award for winning a business award award hangs proudly on the wall. 

There are unfortunately building works going on directly beside the hotel and this proved to be completely disruptive during our stay. We paid for a late check out but on both days we were woken up early with hammering & banging. On morning one I called down at 07.50. Day 2 it seemed to start around 9.30 and lasted until we couldn’t take the noise anymore and left our room early. Despite paying the €25 for late check out. 

The situation was however sweetened by the deputy manager who was absolutely apologetic throughout my complaining and offered to buy us lunch. Which we took. The food at the hotel was lovely and of great standard. We had breakfast both days, lunch one day and dinner on our first night. The bar staff were brilliant! Very attentive and waiting times were managed perfectly. The rooms are clean and of a great standard. There’s no slippers in the room and the hair shampoo offered is a 2:1. So if you’ve thick hair, pack a conditioner. We did have to call for extra towels, as there wasn’t enough in the room. But once we called we had the towels. The hotel has been rated as average due to the level of noise and disruption. But if this wasn’t a consideration I would have rated higher. ",3,2018,06,29
213,"Excellent service, excellent food, tip top everything",Attended business conference here and was very impressed with professionism and excellent servise provided. Staff were lovely and so helpful. Facilites excellent and lovely comfortable ambiance in hotel. We moved to ground floor room at back of hotel with herbert park as backdrop. Bar-b-q on decking and beautiful selection for starters and desert. A very enjoyable evening in an excellent hotel,5,2018,06,29
213,Faulty Towers!!!!!!,"We stayed here when we went to the RDS arena. The venue is across the road from the arena which it’s location is the only thing going for it.

First of all the guy on reception was rude on arrival!!! Not a great start. 

When we were in the room, we called down to ask for extra towels and conditioner as there was only shampoo in the room! They brought towels up but no conditioner so I was told they would come back with some, after about 20mins I had to call reception again and was then told there was none..... if they had only said that to begin with!!!

The next morning we were awoken by banging at 07:50. We called down to reception and was told this was coming from outside. However it sounds like it was in our room. The wall it was coming through wasn’t an outside wall. Therefore defo somewhere in the hotel. This then stopped and we went for breakfast. 

We decided to take a nap before our flight and had late checkout. However when we went back to the room there was constant drilling!!!!! When we called again,they said it was again coming from outside! About 5 mins late we called back and asked if there was a schedule etc so we know when this would stop. We were told by someone else that there isn’t a set time schedule for work being done in the hotel but it’s not till after 10am!!! So which is it outside or in the hotel!!!  I have taken recordings of the noise which I wish I could post. It was that loud that even when we turned the TV up full we still couldn’t hear the TV!!!

If there is work going on that should be specified at the time of booking. No one seemed to care that we needed to sleep as we had a night time flight back home and were working early the next day. ",1,2018,06,27
213,Great wee spot,Stayed here last weekend with my little girl when attending Taylor Swift concert. Hotel seems lovely although we didnt really spend much time in it. Room was lovely and really spacious. View wasnt great as it was overlooking scaffolding due to ongoing work but we were left a box of chocolates in our room which made up for it. I thought it was a bit pricey for one night room only but then again most hotels bump prices up when there is a concert on nearby plus we booked last minute as we won the concert tickets. Cant comment on the food as we didnt eat here. Parking is available but it was an extra €12 on top of hotel room price. My little girl left her teddy behind she had from birth but the hotel located it and posted it out to us and deducted the postage from my card which i didnt care about as we were glad to have the teddy returned. Staff were friendly and very welcoming and made our stay very pleasant.,3,2018,06,24
213,Great Stay,We stayed here for 3 nights.  Wonderful and clean hotel.  Comfortable room and good breakfast.  Right next to a beautiful park in a very quiet and nice neighborhood.  It was a little far to the main part of the city but we liked how it wasn't right in the middle of it all.,5,2018,06,20
213,Great stay,"Just spent a very relaxing night in the Herbert Park Hotel.We had originally booked another hotel in Dublin but changed the booking when we found this one online and it was a good decision,the Herbert Park is spotlessly clean,quiet,calm and spacious.Its beside a park and in the centre of Ballsbridge with all its bars and restaurants.I will definitely return and would recommend this hotel to anyone who travels to Dublin and wants a tranquil oasis just 10 minutes from the centre of the city",4,2018,06,20
213,Great stay,"We only stayed one night but found everything to be very good, couldn't fault anything, room very good & breakfast excellent. Only booked 2 days before on their own website and got special offer 20% discount which worked out very good price including breakfast and comparable to our usual hotel. Will definitely stay here again",4,2018,06,20
213,Stay at Herbert Park Hitel,It turned out good. Our room was on lower floor overlooking scaffolding with machinery and noise. I spoke to the desk personnel. He was great about changing our room as I was with my roommate and she was ill. She would not have any rest at all if we had not been able to change room. He was kind to change us. He was from Dubrovnik. I do not remember his name. Many Thanks to him. It was a lovely hotel.,4,2018,06,20
213,First trip to Dublin,"Nice older hotel located adjacent to picturesque walking Herbert Park and a 10 min cab ride to downtown.  Several good dining options in or near the hotel. Hotel staff provided very good service. 
Be sure to identify the next door construction noise during the work week and they will try to acomodate . 
Would return to this hotel.",4,2018,06,20
213,Birthday lunch for 61 guests,"We had an excellent lunch time celebration on the 2nd June 2018 at the Herbert Park Hotel. 61 adults and 6 children, they had the children's menu, and the hot and cold buffet was lovely, with nice choices of hot and cold food. A very full and tasty dessert buffet also. The house wine white and red served on the terrace and with the meal was very good. Excellent service The children all played in view from the dining terrace in the Herbert Park, good fun. ",5,2018,06,20
213,Fair but overall disappointing,"I don’t often write negative reviews but I must say for the price we paid for one night’s accommodation, this was an overall disappointing experience. The hotel rooms are quite dated and not really the quality I expected from the photos presented by the hotel. Surprised that breakfast was not included in the room rate, nor was car parking - which was €12 per night. It would be a simple gesture to waive this for hotel guests - this is not a city centre hotel. The night-time room service menu (after 10pm) was very limited, and although there are sandwiches, our request to have it toasted was met with a flat ‘no’! The shower pressure was very low and bathroom towels were not great quality, very cheap toiletries provided. It advertises a fitness centre but it is basic and has no free weights. The gate to access the hotel from Herbert Park shuts in the evening but this isn’t well sign-posted and when we got to the shut gate we had no idea how to access the hotel - a sign or map would be helpful. On the plus side - location is great if you need to be in that area (around RDS / Donnybrook Stadium). Staff were pleasant and accommodating. Overall I probably wouldn’t return for the price that we paid.",3,2018,06,18
213,.....always perfect !!!,"I stay here quite regularly due to business; the hotel is fantastic and whilst the location, amenities, cleanliness, rooms and food are all great...:it’s the welcoming staff ( front desk team in particular ) who go above and beyond to make each stay perfect ! 

Thank you Herbert Park team, the only time I don’t stay with you when I’m in Dublin is when you are fully booked....other hotels in the area don’t come anywhere close to your standards or guest experience !!!

Recommendations

Make sure to book early as this hotel books up quickly during the year

Get a room overlooking or towards the park...although all rooms are gorgeous, those overlooking Herbert Park are lovely !

Breakfast is really tasty, book it at check in !

213,"Tired room, inhospitable front staff, stay somewhere else","I came here for a conference.  I had some unforeseen flight delays (as if I could control that) and contacted the hotel.  They refused to work with me and insisted on charging me for the missed night - because it was within their ""VERY STRICT"" 24 hour cancelation policy.  I was told that I could contact the sales manager when I got to the hotel the next day.

The next day I arrived too late to speak with the manager, so attempted the following day.  The assistant manager that I spoke with must have some sort of military background because she can be seen lording over the staff like an ornery communist dictator just waiting for someone to step out of line so that she may get some enjoyment out of correcting their errant behavior.  She is definitely in the wrong profession as she lacks any semblance of ""hospitality"" in the way she speaks to the customer or in the way she carries herself.

This non-hospitable, assistant manager told me again that they have a very strict 24 hour cancelation policy.  And, since I had booked via Expedia, I was not really her customer as I had a contract with Expedia not her hotel (of course Expedia told me that the hotel refused to make any concessions in the booking and that I would have to work with them).  Therefore because I was not her customer she was not required to do anything for me.  If I had booked directly with her and made it so that she didn't have to pay Expedia 60 EUR per night for my booking - she would be more inclined to treat me like a customer.  REALLY?  Well, I was not the one that forced you to put your inventory onto Expedia to sell it.  That was their business decision - and they can remove the inventory at any time.

I also had an issue where I put the ""Do Not Disturb"" sign on my door as I had left my personal things lying out.  I came back to find that they had come in anyway and cleaned my room.  When I called down the this same ""assistant manager"" was on staff and called back to tell me that they had done nothing wrong as the sign had said ""service my room"" according to her cleaner - so clearly I was lying.  First off - who in their right mind has a single sign that says ""clean my room"" on one side and ""do not disturb"" on the other.  Those things fall off all the time and or random people could come by and simply flip the sign around.  Either way, the completely non-responsible attitude of the staff here is the opposite of what anyone would expect in the lodging industry.

Outside of the horrible front desk staff and management - the gentlemen that runs the breakfast at the restaurant should be made the hotel manager.  He was the only one on staff that I saw trying to provide a high level of service and consistently went above and beyond.

In regards to the property.  The rooms are very tired.  Carpet throughout is old, frayed, stained or faded.  Beds are extremely hard and the whole place needs to be refreshed.  This hotel feels like it was once a great place to stay - but no one in my 5 person group would ever stay at this location again (and none of them had the absurd interactions with the manager that I did).

Stay somewhere else.",2,2018,06,13
213,Comfortable stay ,"Lovely modern hotel in a nice location, we stayed here for 2 nights in May and quite enjoyed the hotel. 
We arrived at the hotel at about 3.30pm and there were 8 of staying here with separate rooms, all the rooms were ready apart from ours! Which we thought it was very horrid for a room not be ready at that time of the day. Luckily the manager came out and got a room for us.
The staff are very friendly and welcoming, the lobby area was quite pleasant to sit and a paper or have a drink/food. 
Its a shame they don’t have outside sitting as the weather was quite nice and we could not sit outside for a drink.
The room was very nice an big with a good view from the third floor, the bathroom supplies were quite sparse and could do with a review. 

We only booked the room and no breakfast but we did try the breakfast and it was quite poor in service and quality! We were a party of 8 people and we all came down for breakfast in the lobby area and it took so long for everything to arrive and when it did it was quite poor. 
Overall we enjoyed our stay and would stay here again but with better breakfast. ",4,2018,06,10
213,Bland and ordinary with construction directly adjacent to one side of hotel,"Our flight was late and it was nearly midnight when we arrived. The cold, sterile lobby was deserted, as was the bar at the end of the cavernous ground floor. The desk clerk managed to grunt in greeting. The window of our room looked out at multiple levels of scaffolding that began about six feet away. The room was comfortable and adequate but had no personality and was a little rough around the edges with worn carpet and dinged wood. Lovely, efficient staff in the bar. The neighborhood is quite nice but it is a 30 euro cab fare from the airport. This hotel was definitely not worth what we paid for it.",3,2018,06,02
213,"Nice hotel, great location.","Within walking distance to nice restaurants; welcoming and spacious lobby; appropriate for business meetings.  Room was clean. Breakfast buffet is excellent, accommodate special requests. No iron nor ironing board in the room, but you may request one.",4,2018,06,02
213,"Unhelpful staff, somewhat old rooms","Location is great, although the rooms could use some renovation, hotel is aging, and you can get much better deals in the area.
I got a room that was facing the building's huge air conditioning machine, that was obviously noise. Asked the hotel staff for a room change, their response was, that i should not worry it won't be that loud after 11PM (guess what, it was until 2AM). Unacceptable!!
Poor isolation on the windows (thus the noise), so little bugs/spiders could come back and forth there...",2,2018,06,02
213,Class Hotel in a lovely corner of Dublin,"Ballsbridge is a very nice part of Dublin, there’s plenty of good restaurants, pleasant pubs, green parks and a lot of working offices. Finding a hotel in the locality that’s comfortable, quiet, relaxing, while having all the facilities (sufficient parking, great breakfast, inviting bar) that matter is never easy. This hotel is a mini oasis on the edge of tranquil public park in the heart of busy Ballsbridge. Book with them directly on their online website for best rates. The Dart train station is a 15 min walk away which on a rainy Dublin day is perhaps 5 mins more than ideal. But apart from that there’s little wrong with this hotel. ",4,2018,05,31
213,Be aware about current construction ,"There is the construction in progress. Drilling exactly in your head! Noise is very loud. Unfortunately hotel staff don’t inform clients beforehand. Don’t book this hotel, ask when they finish this terrible construction first! Otherwise you will be disappointed very much...",1,2018,05,30
213,Excellent,Stayed here for a brief Family gathering and enjoyed our time at this excellently located hotel in the Embassy area of Dublin 4. The hotel is modern and well appointed and has a very friendly and engaging staff. A particular word of thanks to Dharam and Sameer who looked after us so well in the lobby lounge. We will return again soon.,5,2018,05,29
213,CONSTRUCTION !!!!!!!!!!,"We stayed as a family on a trip to Ireland and this hotel was a real let down. 
 
Construction started on the first day at 8.30am waking us. Before I spoke to the reception I checked the website and there was no information about the construction works. Not pleased that we weren’t informed of the works which would have given us the option to chose elsewhere.",1,2018,05,29
213,Construction noise,"Beautiful hotel but with constant noice. I accompanied my husband on a business trip, but had work of my own to finish during the day. The drilling start at 20 and didn't finish until 4. It was impossible to work or stay in the room. Fortunately the park next door is a gem. Beautiful mini lake, walking path and waterfowl. It even had a food truck rodeo on Sunday afternoon. I would stay at this hotel just to be near this park. ",3,2018,05,28
213,"FABULOUS HOTEL in DUBLIN, one of the BEST","The hotel is located in Dublin 4 area, some 10-15 min from the city center, close to the US Embassy, a very lovely park behind it, some great pubs and small shops in the vicinity. It is a family run business and one of the best in Dublin. The rooms are very big, very nice and sunny, beds and pillows great, you can get a perfect night's sleep. Breakfast is fabulous. Staff is very kind and helpfull. Ideal for business travel or leisure. Hotel also good for conferences and events. Definitely recomend. Definitely will go back here again.",5,2018,05,28
213,"DHARAM, The coolest bartender in All of Dublin ",I first met the coolest bartender in all of Dublin in April of 2016 when I stayed at the herbert park hotel in April of 2016. He was so memorable that when I returned in may of 2018 I could not contain my excitement to be reunited with this lovely man. His level of service is superb. His personality is unparalleled with anything I have ever experienced before from a bartender. The level of service he provides incredible. If anyone ever has a negative thing to say about his service they are lying. I love this man. ,5,2018,05,26
213,One of the best Hotel to stay,"I stayed in the hotel for 4 days and my experience was great. It had wonderful service in the bar and the morning breakfast was the best out of all the places I have stayed. So if you want to stay and enjoy 1 of the best hotels and enjoy a great breakfast,stay at this hotel.",5,2018,05,26
213,Great experience in Herber Park ,I stayed for 4 nights in this hotel and my experience there was fantastic. The food was really good and also the room was amazing. The best thing of this hotel is the staff specially the bartenders Dharam and Samir. They were best giving us a great service and were super professional. I would love to come back again just to see them. ,5,2018,05,26
213,Best of all the hotels our group stayed at,"We were on a CIE customized tour of Ireland and stayed at half a dozen hotels rated 4 star or better.  IMHO, Herbert Park Hotel was heads and tails above all the other hotels.  It had a very comfortable bed and pillows, excellent breakfast and well appreciated and complimentary extras such as a cappuccino machine, bottled water, and even more TV channels to name a few.

Other supposedly four star hotels in Ireland couldn't even get the heat to work while showers were cold and the bed mattresses were concave.  This hotel saved the tour for me!",5,2018,05,26
213,Extremely disappointing stay,"I checked into this hotel yesterday with six work colleagues and to say our experience was disappointing would be an understatement. After a long day of work, we decided that dinner and drinks in the hotel would be convenient. Dinner was nice, but the service was terrible. When we tried to order drinks after dinner, we got the attention of a waiter he signalled and said to us one minute, after waiting at least ten to fifteen minutes, we decided to go to the bar to order the drinks, where again we were ignored as the barman was showing other people at the bar something on his phone. We gave up and went to bed, here it was difficult to get to sleep with the noise coming from the air conditioning unit. At 6.45am this morning work started outside the room and we were unable to open the curtains as workmen were on the scaffolding outside our window. When I mentioned this at check out this morning and asked why we were not informed about the construction when we checked in, the receptionist told me that he was not here when I checked in, that the construction had nothing to do with the hotel and he did not know what was happening with the construction. I strongly disagree with his response as this directly affected our party as guests of the hotel, at the very least we should have been made aware of the work that was going on. I feel it is the responsibility of the hotel management to find out what is taking place in relation to the construction and inform guests. The receptionist also told me that we were not the only guests that were complaining, and the complaint would be passed on to the group in charge of the work. I assume as way of an apology he provided the parking complimentary, I assume this as he never actually apologised he just said, “I will not charge for the parking, that is all I can do”. We had just paid a bill of €970 for a very unimpressive Monday night in a hotel that in my opinion and the opinion of my colleagues is well below the 4-star standard it claims to be. This hotel, for the price was a serious let down.",1,2018,05,22
213,Excellent Dublin Hotel,"Greeted by Manager on our bus on arrival as well as Manager personally made sure we knew staff was at our service, which was not done at two other hotels I stayed at.  Room was excellent as was dinner and breakfasts.  Pubs and restaurants nearby.  Nice neighborhood to walk around.  Assistance was provided by staff in arranging to post some of my possessions to the staff which had to be done once I had left for home.  I so appreciated the assistance by young staff member who made sure my possessions were sent safely and in a timely manner  and arrived at my home in a timely manner.  I would stay at the hotel again if I visited Dublin, and I would strongly recommend to others to stay at  the hotel as well.  Excellent customer service.",5,2018,05,19
213,Good hotel,"Great hotel, friendly staff, not so friendly bar/coffee bar staff (who were not Irish), excellent breakfast, nice room with a view of the park, good amenities. 
Not good construction work going on right next door. Insane drilling noise meant I couldn't stay in my room and work.  
Complained and was offered another room and given chocolates. Nice touch but am amazed they would put guests on that side of the hotel without informing them of the inconvenience they may experience. 
Otherwise, it's a great place to stay. ",4,2018,05,19
213,Disappointing!!,"Paid a ridiculous amount of money for the room, but as work were paying thought I’d stay here! Wouldn’t recommend it!! Air handling units outside room banging noise out all night and the bar staff were rude and ignorant! More interested in flirting with other guests than serving us. Wish I’d booked the Premier Inn! Avoid!",1,2018,05,16
213,Scaffolding with 6.30am wake up,"I booked a room at this hotel last week, I wasn’t informed that we were given a room that would be overlooking scaffolding, works started at 6.30am waking us. When we got out of bed and opened our curtains there were around 4 builders on a level with our room on the third floor around 5-10 meters away. Not pleased that we weren’t informed of the works which would have given us the option to chose elsewhere.",1,2018,05,16

Central  location and access to the nearby park  a real bonus. Airport buses stop nearby.
Room comfortable and very clean. Breakfast very good and lots of choice.",5,2018,05,10
213,Dublin tour,"This ranked at the top of the four hotels in which we stayed in Ireland.  The welcome for our tour included meal times, instructions for the hotel, and a sample beverage!  The decor was modern and attractive, and was spotlessly clean (we even saw the staff brushing the cushions of the couches in the lobby lounge).  Traveling as a group of 3 women, we'd experience both great and cramped triple rooms---this was the biggest and most comfortable of them all.  The beds were amazing and the amenities were first class.  The breakfast buffet had the widest selection we'd encountered.  Would definitely return.",5,2018,05,09

213,Excellent Sunday Roast in style.,I booked here for the Sunday Roast in the Pavillon Restaurant. As it was a sunny and hot afternoon they had opened the windows in the restaurant so you had the feeling of sitting in the park. The food is of great quality and the portions are big.

Upon arrival I spoke with the general manager Egle, who gave us a tour of the venue and its facilities. Straight away we knew we were dealing with a professional.  Egle,along with her excellent staff, helped us manage the hundreds of foreign visitors we had attending and also extended the hotels hospitality to our staff throughout the week.

213,The staff are the real gems!,"I booked Herbert Park Hotel through trip advisor's reviews. The downside is, it is about a 10 min taxi ride to town depending on traffic.
The bright side is, you get away from the hustle and bustle of the city as this hotel is located in a lovely neighbourhood of Ballsbridge next to the Herbert Park. Perfect for an evening stroll amidst the row of blooming cherry blossoms! The front desk staff by the name of Davide is ever so helpful. He made recommendations on the available tours and booked me on the Cliffs of Moher tour by Wild Rover plus all the taxi rides to town and the airport.  Nothing is too much trouble even though he was very busy. The Polish housekeeper who cleaned my room 323 needs special mention for her thoughtfulness. She hangs up my towels neatly and places a paper coaster over my teacup so dust wouldn't settle in. Clearly, these little things set a good hotel apart from the rest. I was truly pleased! I do hope to stay there again upon my next visit.

213,Very comfortable stay in good location,"This is a well-run hotel just outside the city centre, a very pleasant 20 minute walk would take you to St Stephen's Green. Buses and taxis are easily available also.
We had 2 separate bookings covering our 3-night stay and the receptionist Arijan was really kind and helpful, he found us a lovely room on the second floor, so that we did not have to move after 2 nights. The beds are good: firm yet soft enough to ensure comfort.  Very nice firm pillows. The room lighting was also good and there was a handy multi-socket unit on the desk for charging mobile phones etc with a thoughtfully provided converter for non-Irish/British electrical devices.  The bathroom had nice towels and plenty of space to put out our toiletries. There was no shaving mirror but the lighting was good. The showerhead was fixed to the wall, normally a drawback for me, but the water pressure was good. There was a Nespresso coffee machine and you can use the hot water to make tea if coffee is not your thing. 

Breakfast was excellent, except for the tea, which could have had more flavour. There was a plentiful choice of fruit, cereals, yoghurt, cheese etc. The hot breakfast looked good too. The dining room is lovely, there is a beautiful view out to the tree-lined public park which adjoins the hotel.",4,2018,04,30
213,Short holiday ,"Excellent hotel, clean and functional, one of the best ever visited. Friendly personnel, excellent breakfast, very good location. Multilanguage reception personnel, smiling and trying to help. What can I say more? For me and my family it was the perfect place to stay in Dublin. ",5,2018,04,30
213,Very little sleep,"Stayed for 2 nights. The first night, perfect. The 2nd night our neighbours in room 123 came in about 3am. They were very loud, drunk and chatting loudly. Despite trying to quiten them but knocking on their door twice, i then called reception. Despite a visit from the night porter they didn’t stop until they fell asleep about 1-2 hours later. I didn’t get back to sleep. Disappointed with the hotel and also the other guests. Can you. It be quiet when you come in from a night out. If you don’t sleep well give this hotel a miss!",1,2018,04,28
213,Anniversary celebration ,"Arrived to a very warm welcome from front of house.
Staff were very helpful and polite.
Food - Breakfast  is a must. Huge selection. 
Room - Spacious clean and comfortable.
All in all, a thoroughly enjoyable stay, we will be going back.
Ideal location too. ",5,2018,04,27
213,Mediocre.,"Ok rooms, comfy beds. Nice location. Broken hairdryer, broken coffee machine, no iron. Offered breakfast at check In, found out in the morning breakfast only started at 7 (a bit late for a hotel with business guests?) I was leaving around that time so asked for breakfast to be removed from the bill as I wouldn't eat it, they refused and still charged. ",3,2018,04,26
213,Nice hotel,Right by all the Embassies.  See a lot of business people in bar area.  Herbert Park abuts hotel and offered nice paved walking trails  by a pond.   The food was great. Staff was excellent. Many were foreign born.  Front desk made reservations for us at local eateries.  A few pubs within walking distance.  City Center was a hike but doable.  There was construction going on so impossible to nap during the day but very quiet after 5pm.,5,2018,04,25
213,Enjoyable stay,"I would recommend you check out where to park or how access hotel carpark before you set out if travelling by car. The hallways are a little dated but the room was clean, contemporary and comfortable. I really enjoy the coffee machine. Breakfast was good but made all the better by the attentive staff. In fact I would say the staff all round were very helpful and polite. I would recommend this hotel. ",4,2018,04,24
213,"tired hotel, nice staff","the hotel is a bit tired. My room was next to aircondition exhaust and therefore noisy. Staff is really nice, I especially liked Croatian guy at the reception. Breakfast very good. Rooms need refurbishment.",3,2018,04,24
213,Great hotel.,"My experience at the Herbert Park Hotel was excellent.  Traveled to Dublin for pleasure and found the hotel staff and rooms to be a true pleasure.  The breakfast was excellent.  The location was nice, close enough to walk to many sites.",5,2018,04,23
213,Great hotel and will return,"My husband, two young kids and I stayed here for one night last weekend. We booked adjoining rooms which were very clean and modern. The kids (aged 7 and 9) were delighted with their room - as were we! I chose this hotel because of its proximity to the RDS and Roly’s Restaurant but I had also had a great stay here previously. The reception staff were very polite and helpful throughout our stay. We were very happy with the room amenities. We ordered room service for dinner for the sake of the kids after a long car journey. The food was great. The Manager on a Duty at breakfast was especially nice to our kids and made a real effort so credit to her. Will definitely return again.",5,2018,04,22
213,Comfortable spacious and welcoming,"Couldn’t fault this hotel. We had booked 3 rooms at another 4 star hotel in Dublin which did not meet our expectations. We managed to book The Herbert Park Hotel last minute  on line. When we arrived we were greeted b6 Dominic who went out of his way to help us. We enjoyed a very late lunch at the hotel and our rooms were spacious and comfy. 

Other reviews state breakfast was expensive but ours was included in the price and was of a very high standard. Everything you could possibly want and attentive staff without being overwhelming.

This place knocks spots off the hotel we had booked in Dublin and I’d stay again. It would be even better if there was a swimming pool. 

Highly recommended and my thanks to the staff.",5,2018,04,20
213,Herbert Park Hotel,"First hotel we stayed at in Ireland. There for three nights and met up with a CIE Tour. Rooms were very clean and front desk was awesome. Breakfast was fantastic but a bit pricey. Great little pubs across the street, Starbucks around the corner. Really enjoyed the stay.",4,2018,04,20
213,It was fine,"With the price of the room, I would have expected parking and breakfast but parking was €12 and breakfast was €15-29. Location was good for the RDS. Seating for bar food wasn’t great for eating, but chairs and couches with low tables so you were crouched over trying to eat. ",3,2018,04,18
213,More than expected,"I booked this hotel last year based solely on its location to the RDS (across the road) as we were attending with our son. I wanted the convenience of a hotel within walking distance. I got a good room rate for a triple room and figured it'd be grand for the night. When we arrived I was very pleasantly surprised by how nice the hotel was. Extremely friendly staff, nice decor, room was spotless. The nespresso machine in the room was a nice touch. We had also booked a table for dinner that night and the food was incredible. If I was to ever stay in that part of Dublin again I would without hesitation book the Herbert park hotel again.  ",5,2018,04,18
213,Brilliant,"Couldn't fault here. Would definitely stay again. Hotel was immaculate and good value for money.
Staff were very friendly and helpful. Was upgraded to executive suite and enjoyed jacuzzi bath. I would highly recommend.",5,2018,04,17
213,Great hotel and super friendly service,"Loved the hotel.  New and modern. Comfy king bed with super white and soft sheets. Staff was super friendly and attentive. It is located in a very nice residential area with some restaurants.  It is not located within walking distance to Dublin ‘s main sites, but the cab ride was not expensive",5,2018,04,16
213,Great stay,Hotel is very nice. Rooms are clean and comfortable. Looks modern and new. Walking distance to many restaurants. Bar and restaurant available. Best part of the stay was the breakfast buffet. So many good things to eat and the staff really takes care of you. ,4,2018,04,14
213,Wonderful Hotel and Personnel,"We were in Ireland for two weeks and stayed in many hotels but this was the BEST ONE!!  The accommodations were excellent, the personnel were friendly and helpful, and the food was great.  But the best part of the visit is the personnel.  Very, very helpful and friendly.  Will help you with any problem or anything you would like to do.  Being our first visit to Ireland, we weren't sure where to go, but this hotel's personnel were excellent!!  Highly recommended !!  ",5,2018,04,12
213,Good value hotel within close proximity of city centre,"Very pleased with our stay at Herbert Park Hotel. I booked over the phone as I wanted a room near my elderly parents and to stay in a quieter part of the hotel. The reception team couldn't have been more helpful in meeting this request and this helpfulness from the staff continued during our stay.

My room was very clean and comfortable, whilst the coffee machine in the room was put to good use. The bathroom was modern and the shower fairly powerful.

There was plenty of choice on the menu at breakfast time and the restaurant staff were friendly and attentive.

The hotel is located in Ballsbridge, outside of the city centre but access to the city was easy and fairly low cost. It took 5-10 minutes by taxi and cost us 10-12 Euros, whilst the number 4 and number 7 buses stop almost outside the hotel. There are also bars and restaurants within an easy walk; three of which we tried during our stay and could recommend.",5,2018,04,11
213,Comfortable Stay,The staff appeared to take great strides to make sure we were comfortable which was greatly appreciated.  Convenient location with plenty of eating establishments nearby.  Beds were comfortable and rooms had ample space.  There is a construction project ongoing and it got irritatingly noisy later in the morning.,4,2018,04,10
213,Top notch staff!,Breakfast was delicious. The wait staff was remarkable. The hotel was spotless. What a wonderful beginning to our tour with CIE throughout Ireland. Thank you Herbert Park Hotel. Hope to visit you again!,5,2018,04,08
213,Excellent as always,I would highly recommend this beautiful hotel. The staff are very helpful and there are never any issues checking in or out. The place is extremely clean and very comfortable. The breakfast has everything you could ask for.,5,2018,04,05
213,Fantastic Hotel,"We booked this hotel for a family gathering. Hotel was fantastic sorting out the bookings for each party with different arrival dates. The rooms are lovely, the breakfast and food in the restaurant is fantastic.  The staff cannot do enough for you and are so friendly. Will definitely return, highly recommend this hotel.",5,2018,04,04
213,2 nights away,Had the most wonderful stay in the Herbert Park with my sister.  Breakfast buffet was amazing.  Ate both nights in the restaurant - mouth-watering . Staff so professional  friendly and helpful . Again can't wait to go back!,5,2018,04,03
213,Stay comfortable in residential and green part of Dublin.,This was my second stay at Herbert Park Hotel and I booked now a double room. The beds were fantastic to sleep in and I liked the bad tube. The breakfast is great especially with the parkview. I would like to visit this hotel again in the future.,5,2018,04,03
213,Upmarket comfort,"Weekend away with partner, too far out of town to walk repeatedly but plenty of taxis . Situated near avenue of shops , bars and restaurants so no need to travel to far . Definitely more business than holiday hotel . Park behind is small but beautiful. We felt it was expensive for  breakfast ( 20 euro)",4,2018,04,03
213,Good Hotel when you're not in the construction site,"We booked 3 month in advance and upon arrival we were given rooms that were right in the middle of a construction site with no view at all (dark!) ... after a while the friendly staff managed to move us ... everything else is really good, but watch out for those rooms!",4,2018,04,03
213,Quick Survey,"My review is positive. I enjoyed my stay at the Herbert Park Hotel. The staff is friendly and helpful. I could not use my debit card at the check-in, so I had to cross the street to get the money in cash (point of improvement)",4,2018,04,03
213,Expectations not hit...,"Lovely staff, and well presented welcoming area. Big let downs were the room - we had a kingsize bed, but the frame was filled with two double bed mattresses which was very uncomfortable, our view was of scaffolding, and next door had an argument go on for hours in the night and no one from the hotel stopped it! Very expensive for what it actually is. Staff were ever so good though!",2,2018,04,02
213,Weekend of fun ,"Easter weekend and 2 nights away with hubby to Dublin. Arrived early and checked into room immediately without having to wait even though we were very early. Room was lovely and the hotel very classy inside. Walking distance for lunch and the obligatory pint of Guinness in the Bridge pub then taxi down to 3Arena for the Sam Smith Concert. Easy to get home and walked on the Sunday to the AViva for Leinster V Saracens match. 
Hotel so close for these big events and surrounding area with park lovely for a walk. Fantastic weekend & the breakfast menu amazing!!! 
Top Class. ",5,2018,04,02
213,Excellent hotel,Our stay at the Herbert this weekend was perfect. Nothing was too much trouble for any of the staff we encountered during our stay. Especially impressed with the fact that our room was freshly serviced each day to the same standard as when we arrived. Ideally situated 20 minute walk from centre of Dublin. ,5,2018,04,02
213,Great for business stay,"Very clean hotel with good restaurant, lounge & room service. Nice location next to park and many pubs, restaurants and cafes close by. Good value and quiet, but hotel showing age a bit. Some remodeling noise during weekdays.",4,2018,04,01
213,Rugby weekend,"We went for the Ireland-Scotland 6Nations game. Despite the busyness, the staff were professional & helpful - cupcakes & whiskey just added to whole experience! We hadnt booked a table for dinner but Dominic at reception sorted us out with a booking at a nearby restaurant(Bellucci’s also definitely worth a visit with great food & friendly staff). Clean rooms, comfy beds, friendly staff- definitely recommend this hotel. ",5,2018,04,01
213,So lovely ,"Stayed here last night with my husband. Lovely and clean,friendly and helpful staff. Good tv stations,the bed was huge and so so comfortable. And the best part was the Nespresso machine in the room!!!! Bliss ☺️😍",5,2018,04,01
213,Ireland tour,"was a very good experience everyone was so nice and the rooms were clean and compfortable , will recommend to friends, located in a nice area for walking, shopping. food was very good also. Was a great experience",5,2018,03,29
213,Beautiful,This hotel was very nice.. The rooms were nice with a great view. Everybody that worked for the hotel was very pleasant and always willing to help you if you needed anything. I would recommend this hotel if you are in the area..,5,2018,03,28
213,Spectacular afternoon tea!,"We were looking for a great location to host afternoon tea for 8. On a beautiful day we were able to stroll into Herbert Park before and after our afternoon which turned out to be a feast of savoury and sweet treats.
One of our group had taken her Mum to afternoon tea recently in a different Dublin hotel and said that the Herbert Park offering was far superior!
We were so well looked after, we'll definitely be back next time we want to be spoilt!",5,2018,03,26
213,Still setting the standard,"I stayed in the Herbert Park four times in the last two weeks, and each stay was flawless, as usual. From being pleasantly ""welcomed back"" at reception, through the swift check-in to the spotless room, this hotel knows how to minimise the hassle and maximise the ease. Restaurant and room service prompt, check-out easy.  Reassuring to know the hotel and staff still have their finger very sensitively on the pulse.",5,2018,03,26
213,Impressed,"Beautiful rooms with all the conveniences you would expect in a five star hotel. The staff was very accommodating, friendly and helpful. I had a malfunctioning coffee maker and it was replaced or fixed almost immediately. Being my first trip to Ireland, I inquired about the differences in Irish whiskies and Lara took the time to school me on what to look for and expect in the many unique Irish whiskies available. The only meals taken were the breakfast buffet, which was expansive, something for everyone, and all high quality and fresh.",5,2018,03,25
213,Great Hotel ,"Another great weekend break at this Hotel. Relaxing atmosphere, check in is quick and staff throughout very attentive . Rooms are spacious and spotless. Breakfast has a good and varied selection .  Large park adjacent to Hotel for relaxing walks. ",5,2018,03,25
213,Quality Property!!  Super Service!,"This property is a great quality hotel.  While it may be a little off the beaten path, it is still very convenient to downtown Dublin.  We walked to the downtown area every day of our stay and the walk is easy and fast!  Also, within 5 minutes of the property are several great restaurants and Irish Pubs!  The staff was also friendly and helpful.  The breakfast buffet, which was included in our rate was first class!  We loved the property and will recommend to others!",5,2018,03,25
213,Another nice stay,Very good hotel with excellent friendly and engaging staff. Location is perfect with ample parking. Always receive nice touches like little gifts for my kids that show the hotel and staff care more than other hotels. One of the nicest breakfast in Dublin ,4,2018,03,24
213,Herbert park hotel,"Let’s start with the positives: the receptionist was friendly and was able to gives us a change of room when asked. Negatives: construction, a couple of the waitresses weren’t as friendly and the hotel is a little far from the city. ",3,2018,03,24
213,Good Hotel and friendly staff,Very comfortable hotel. Would prefer if there was a walk in shower instead of bath which is not suitable for a person with a disability. It is also a little bit far out from the city centre. Dinner and breakfast were very good,4,2018,03,23
213,Top Class,"Have been a regular guest at the Herbert park hotel and the hotel and its staff, particularly reception staff have never left me down and have been consistently excellent. Rooms are of high quality with air con, comfortable beds and sky sports. Will continue to stay in this hotel while in Dublin.",5,2018,03,23
213,Great Experience Yet Again,"We have chosen to stay at Herbert Park Hotel once again while visiting Dublin. We wanted to avoid the craziness of the St Patrick’s weekend in the central hotels. Everything was exceptional! My partner and I were greeted with a smile, shamrock cupcake and a shot of fine whiskey. Even if we were here for a different occasion it was a pleasant touch. All the staff members were friendly and efficient. Pity we do not come to Dublin more often. Highly recommended.",5,2018,03,22
213,First choice for a Dublin hotel,"Stayed one night earlier this week en route to the airport.  When we need to stay overnight in Dublin  we always choose the Herbert Park  as it is always as expected - good rooms, good food, friendly staff, great location and reasonable prices.  We have stayed in other hotels when the Herbert Park was full and have not found any to match even when paying a lot more. We would highly recommend the Herbert park to anyone visiting Dublin.",5,2018,03,22
213,Luxurious hotel with an upmarket ring to it,"Stayed here for two nights attending a company conference. 

Place has a luxurious appeal to it. My room was spacious and beautiful, overlooking the adjacent park. The hotel is well situated outside of the very busy streets. Breakfast is abundant, bathroom and bed very much OK. Service was great.
 
Why only 4 out of 5? Well some very minor points; pipes were a bit noisy every now and then, price was substantial though not excessive (but that may be due to being in Dublin). 

So all in all a very good experience. Would revisit when in the neighborhood. ",4,2018,03,21
213,Spot on for the Rugby,"Stayed for 2 nights for the Ireland v Scotland rugby match. We landed in Dublin mid morning and used the AirCoach to get to Ballsbridge. The 702 picks you up outside the terminal and stops about 5 mins walk from the hotel. Easily the cheapest way to get from the airport.

We arrived shortly after 10am but were able to check in to both rooms as they were ready. Very comfortable rooms, decent sized bathroom and much to my wifes annoyance (and my delight!) Sky Sports on the TVs!

The bar downstairs is nice, the service is decent and the drinks prices when compared with the rest of Dublin aren't too bad. The food in the bar is very food to and fairly priced. 

For the rugby the hotel is ideally situated, you can see the Aviva from the front door and it's about a 10 minute walk, Across the road are Crowes and Mary Macs/Paddy Cullens which are well known rugby pubs and worth visiting. The hotel itself was showing the game and had several bars open as well as a carvery which was clearly a well rehearsed scenario as it worked perfectly.

Breakfast is also very good. Full Cooked breakfast and continental options available. Service again excellent.

Got the AirCoach back to the airport, if you do use, be aware that for the return journey, you need to flag the bus down otherwise it won't stop.",5,2018,03,21
213,Very good hotel to stay,"Little pricey, but worth it. Breakfast is really good, rooms are spacious enough with good furnishing and facilities. Good wifi, good bathroom as well. adjacent to Herbert park. Location is very good with many good restaurents nearby",4,2018,03,21
213,"Very good hotel, probably top 10%","Generally a positive experience, would stay here again.  Good room and amenities, but the mattress was stiff.  The showerhead in our bathroom was partially broken.

Pretty good location, not very central but 10 minutes walk from the DART station (Landsdowne).

Best thing about the hotel:  the front desk staff.  Always willing to help, great service.  Arijen in particular was awesome to us.

There was one unpleasant incident.  First morning, we weren't sure how to check in to the breakfast area and stood there in front of the clerk in charge of admittance, eyeballing her.  She did not appear to be interested in talking to us or helping us, so we went in and filled our plates.  Fifteen minutes later, she rushed in, got our room number, and told us the breakfast wasn't included with our reservation.  Umm, maybe this is something she could have told us at the entrance to avoid an embarrassment of having to abandon our plates?

It's just as well though, because we found a much better breakfast option at The Greenery a five minute walk away.  (Walk through the park, keep left of the stadium and cross a major road).  Go there for a solid start to your morning.",4,2018,03,20
213,Very nice hotel nd great location,Really lovely hotel. Excellent service nd impeccable staff. Foyer/restaurants were really cold. Heating needed in the snow. Rooms v comfy. Power shower a dream. Loved it. Nice quiet location was v handy for town. ,4,2018,03,19
213,great place to stay,Ideal location. Car park very easy to find and reasonable at 12 euros per day. Room very comfortable. A separate shower would be better rather than a shower curtain over a bath. Nespresso machine a nice touch,5,2018,03,19
213,Our Ireland vacation,The Herbert park hotel went above and beyond for our stay when we were in Ireland! The hotel staff was courteous and always helpful with a smile on their faces. Everything was up to date and all the amenities were top notch!!,5,2018,03,19
213,Honeymoon starting in Dublin,For our honeymoon we are taking a 12 day odessay around Ireland. Our first stop was at Herbert Park Hotel. We loved the hotel. It's very nice with a wonderful staff. We enjoyed the traditional Irish breakfast. But we really loved being treated with a shot of Irish Whiskey. The stay was very enjoyable.,5,2018,03,18
213,"good position, good service",Very well positioned. I liked the room: big bed and free  Nespresso are good details. Breakfast quite complete and not so fat. little  fitness room: only 4 machines but enough. I didn't experienced the dinner. good  hotel.,4,2018,03,17
213,Bad cancellation policy.,"I was travelling for a business meeting to Dubin for 7 days but my visa got stuck because of some paper work. I have requested the hotel to allow me cancel the booking and they reverted saying, yes you can cancel but you have to pay for 7 days and even they didn't offered an option to change the dates. I have asked my all colleagues who have received the visa to look for better hotel which have a better policies and understanding of customer issues.",1,2018,03,14
213,A bit of affordable luxury,"The herbert Park is cetainly not the cheapest hotel you will find, but represents good value in termsof the overall experience.  Staff are very polite and attentive, the rooms a large and spotless, the beds super confortable and the food of a very high standard.  I often stay for business (so not always paying the bill!) and would very much recommend the Herbert Park.  I plan to stay with with my wife one day when we make a trip to Dublin.",5,2018,03,14
213,Rugby Weekend ,"My husband and I were lucky enough to get tickets to the Ireland/Scotland rugby match in the Aviva at the weekend and, as it turned out, lucky enough to spend time in this hotel. The pre and post match atmosphere was really great. Efficient and friendly staff made us feel incredibly welcome and despite the busy and buzzing reception area we didn’t have to wait more than a few minutes to be served our drinks and delicious post match meal. Highly recommend a visit. ",5,2018,03,11
213,A quiet room just what I requested,"I came to Ireland for the first time to attend a meeting in Dublin centre. For this short trip over unsociable hours I requested a quiet room  and got just what I requested, restful. Clean. All the staff were spontaneously helpful and I felt welcomed in a brief time that passed too quickly. I would definitely wish to stay again.",5,2018,03,11
213,Ticks all the boxes,Perfect location for a visit to the city. The rooms are very comfortable with all the things you would expect from a top class hotel.The reception staff were very attentive and allowed us an extra hour to 1pm for check out without a charge which was much appreciated.Breakfast very tasty with a good selection on offer.,5,2018,03,11
213,christmas shopping trip,"stayed here for 1 night before christmas for a shopping trip. Found everything about the hotel to be of a high standard . The bedroom was very good and well equiped and the staff helpful, couldnt complain about a thing",4,2018,03,06
213,Excellent Service and Accomodation,"I was stuck in Dublin during the recent snow storm and the great staff and services levels at Herbert Park Hotel made my stay relatively painless.

213,Lovely Hotel,"Clean hotel with pleasant, courteous staff, only drawback is that I found the lobby and dining area in the lobby area cold in the winter.  The bedrooms however are lovely and cosy.   The breakfast room is looking out on lovely Herbert Park. 

I would recommend this hotel.",4,2018,03,01
213,Always a great stay,"The location of the hotel, the cleanliness of the rooms and the friendliness of the staff makes this a really enjoyable place to stay. I could only highly  recommend this hotel for business or a weekend in Dublin",4,2018,02,27
213,Great hotel,"Great hotel, we stayed here to go to a rugby game in the aviva. Perfect location, friendly and helpful staff. Would stay again. A little pricey for one night but with the game on , beds were in high demand. A  bit dissapointed we had to pay €12 euro to park our car, thought as guests we should have had parking included in the price of our room.",4,2018,02,26
213,Excellent stay,The staff in the hotel are second to none they couldn't be more helpful.......my guests love the hotel and we return each year for the rugby. breakfast was lovely. See you again in 2019 for another fab weekend. thank you very much ,5,2018,02,26
213,Great Location,"The Herbert Park Hotel is in a lovely Ballsbridge location. There are quite a few great restaurants and pubs close by, in addition it is right on Herbert Park, a lovely Heritage Park location. Easy to go straight out for a walk, jog or peaceful relaxation. Another advantage is that it is in walking distance to shopping, business and sporting events. ",5,2018,02,25
213,Comfortable stay,"We had a business conference at the hotel. The rooms were large and the bed comfortable. The bar well furnished and the lounge area very cozy. The hotel is convenient to reach the stadium, a bit further away from the Temple Bar area.",4,2018,02,24
213,Social,"Very happy with the accommodation and the service. The staff were extremely pleasant, approachable and helpful. The views of Herbert Park from the hotel are an oasis in the middle of this bustling city. Breakfast provided a wonderful choice of options that set us up for the day. We will be recommending your hotel to our friends and also recommending the tremendous range of restaurants surrounding the hotel. The hotel was particularly busy during our stay but the general service provided was not impaired in any way and the staff were wonderful.",5,2018,02,23

213,Issue resolved for this weekend Thank you Herbert Park,Following a phone call with the right person I am pleased to say that the hotel have refunded our rooms  for this weekend following a death in the family. Please ignore reviews about this. Gutted that we will not be coming to Dublin as love the city and hotels and obviously missing the rugby!,5,2018,02,22

213,Superb hotel.,"Great location, lovely room, great food. It is a great hotel so close to the centre of Dublin but in a beautiful suburb with a really lovely park adjacent to hotel and a number of great pubs and restaurants on its doorstep. But the staff make the hotel what it is, so friendly, efficient and helpful . The Herbert Park is a haven of tranquility in a beautiful bustling city",3,2018,02,20

213,Rugby match break,"Lovely stay great staff.  It is just a pity that Saturday night was almost double the price of Sunday night due to the Rugby match. This Hotel is very close to the RDS and Aviva Stadium , As I said earlier price hiking I do not like. ",4,2018,02,13
213,super location,"Nice room, great and helpful staff. If you are heading to anything in the Aviva, RDS or a nice bite in Rolly's this is the place to stay. parking is extra and there is building going on at one side of the building so make sure you ask for the quiet side!",5,2018,02,12
213,Very spacious high quality hotel in lovely part of Dublin.,This is the second time my wife and I stayed here when down for a rugby match in the Aviva. This hotel really does a great job catering for guests and rugby fans prior to and after the match. It has such a large spacious foyer where they set up mini bar and food stations to cater for everyone. No queuing or pushing or shoving. Great set up. We checked in with Iaonna who got us into our room quietly and efficiently. The room was spacious and very comfortable on 2nd floor. Bar service is quick and efficient and the food was tasty and just the job before a match. Breakfast was a varied selection and very high quality. Overall great hotel and will definitely stay again.,5,2018,02,12
213,Great hotel,"I held a week function at the hotel and the staff went above and beyond to ensure it ran smoothly. Would highly recommend this hotel for business or holiday.

All staff were excellent, our room was spotless and evening meal was first class. Overall our all too brief stay was  excellent value for money and we cant get to get back again soon. ",5,2018,02,06
213,Enjoyed a lovely relaxed couples weekend in this hotel,Room service was very good and staff were lovely. It's in a great location and rooms were nice and clean. My only criticism is that the lounge food was a little expensive for what it was. Burgers were €19 but were nothing special. ,4,2018,02,05
213,Pavilion Restaurant ,Cannot find a listing for the restaurant in the hotel with a nice view on Herbert Park. Well worth going to the staff are very professional (thank you Siva and Isabel) and attentive. Food well served and quite delicious.,4,2018,02,03

213,Fine,"I stayed 3 nights for business. I appreciated the room to move, the reliable wifi, and the convenience of the location. I didn't have a view from my room. Although some aspects a little dated, everything worked and was comfortable and the room was quiet. I appreciated the good breakfast. The people were friendly. I would recommend to add reference on the home page to the availability of a gym. It was small and not so fancy yet served the purpose just fine.",4,2018,02,02
213,"great location , great staff","The staff is the best we've ever known - warm and personable. Our comfort and happiness seemed to be the priority, specially front desk Dominic, Arian, Marjan . 
The breakfast was excellent

The rooms were spacious, very clean and very comfortable. 

I would highly recommend this hotel.",5,2018,02,01
213,Relaxing stay at the Herbert Park Hotel,"Regular visitors to this hotel, this was another enjoyable stay. It's a pleasant 20 minute stroll to St Stephen's Green and Grafton St area or a 5-10 minute taxi ride away and the beautiful park is right on the doorstep. The hotel is very clean and comfortable with a minimalist feel. ",4,2018,01,31
213,In on the Park,"Great location, the hotel is at an entrance to the historic park. Convenient for an enclave of good restaurants and a pleasant 25 minute walk to the city centre (buses and the DART are close). Check in was friendly and efficient and the room was good value which included a supply of tea and coffee as well as bathroom amenities.

Nice lobby/lounge area in which to relax and/or watch the world go by!

Check-out was equally friendly and efficient.",5,2018,01,31
213,Great location,"Staff could make more of an effort in welcoming the guests. Noise outside room from air/con extractions.

The premises is extremely well presented and comfortable. 

The fitness room advertises weight available however this is not the case and very poorly equipped",3,2018,01,29
213,Luxury accommodations in a great location,"I was very happy with the excellent accommodations at the Herbert Park Hotel.  The staff was very friendly and efficient, the bed was extremely comfortable, the room was clean and up to date, and the complimentary breakfast was fabulous.  I will definitely stay here again next time I'm in Dublin.",5,2018,01,29
213,Girls Break,Nice hotel in a great location. Very friendly staff on check in and check out. The car park is small with very tight spaces-beware! Our room was clean with a nespresso machine. Bathroom a bit small but fine for what we needed. ,4,2018,01,29
213,Great hotel with excellent service ,"Stayed here two days on business, great room service menu, clean and excellent staff- special mention to Davide on reception. I would recommend this. Although a standard business hotel it does not feel dated and is well maintained. The restaurant offers excellent food- would recommend the mushroom risotto !
",4,2018,01,28
213,This hotel deserves it's Certificate of Excellence,"We stayed for one night recently (January 2018) and couldn't fault any aspect of our visit. The location is perfect not only for access to any part of the south of the city suburbs, but also for the city centre (walking distance only if you are fit and a regular walker). There is also a large and beautiful park into which the hotel has it's own access - perfect for walking or jogging. 
The first impression is how bright and airy the public areas are. The staff are outstanding in terms of attention, friendliness and professionalism no matter whether they were in reception, bar or breakfast. The room was large (Standard Twin) and spotlessly clean ... the bathroom must have been recently renovated because it was very clean and fresh looking. The bar had a good buzz and service was prompt and friendly. Parking is provided at a reasonable price (12 Euros overnight). Breakfast is superb, not only because it is in a bright dining room overlooking the park, but also because of the multiple choices offered in a very modern healthy buffet equivalent to  everything that is offered in the better hotels around Europe - from our own experience.",5,2018,01,28
213,"Great breakfast buffet, service","The devil is in the details: and Herbert Park Hotel got a few details right in ways that made my stay truly enjoyable.

First, the breakfast buffet: it’s great to start each day off with good coffee or tea and good food. This one offers a bit of Irish food (picked herring, anyone?) and a lot of “continental comfort food”—a range of fruits and breads and meats, and all beautifully done.

In the room, my primary simple comforts were a universal charger on an extension cord. Though I always bring multiple chargers, I sometimes find in older hotel building there’s not enough outlets, or the outlets are nowhere near the bed. This let me charge all my batteries and read my phone or work on my laptop in bed, which is a small but meaningful comfort.

The next “detail” I really appreciate is a shower that’s easy to figure out. Around the world I have struggled with showers, trying to figure out how to get the right temperature and direct the water to the right spout. Not here: easy peasy!

Additionally, let me praise the staff: from the concierges to the bar staff, the Herbert Park Hotel employees went out of their way to make my stay gracious and enjoyable. They truly “go the extra mile”. Each time I asked for anything, they extended even more. Thanks so much for taking the time and making my stay so pleasant. I will return.",5,2018,01,28
213,Business Trip Perfect,Everything perfect . Great breakfast . each time I come at Herbert it is really perfect.I hihly recommend to stay there. the rooms are very comfortable and the lobby lounge perfect for a drink or business meeting,5,2018,01,27
213,Ok Hotel,"Now more expensive than before, the location being an issue for downtown, think about it twice before booking
Otherwise it is ok overall, good food, good bed, the corridors are quite loud though, if you have a light sleep, you may not sleep so well",4,2018,01,26
213,Friendly staff and lovely room,"Stayed 3 nights for business. The service was fabulous and the staff were super friendly and helpful. The room was spacious, clean and well equipped. Would definitely stay again.  Breakfast was also delicious!",5,2018,01,25
213,Excellent Busines hotel near to the exhibiton centre,"The staff and service at the hotel is exceptional.  They always make us feel really welcome. A delicious breakfast, with lots of choices. The hotel is situated very close to the exhibition centre.  A beautiful park behind the hotel is a great spot for a morning jog. ",5,2018,01,25
213,fabulous breakfast and lovely staff,"perfect location for the RDS shows, very smart, clean and well looked after hotel. Friendly cheerful staff going the extra mile (eg holiday the doors open so we can leg it in from the rain!). superb breakfast - really good choice, nice and fresh - wish i had more time to eat it! rooms spacious and beds comfortable. posh coffee machine but i would have like to see a sachet of hot chocolate and some biscuits. good shower. only issue for us was noise from other guest as it is used as a business hotel, and the reps on a jolly brigade are in... next time i would ask for a room away from groups if possible ",4,2018,01,25
213,Perfect,"Stayed few days for business. Great location, great rooms and lovely team. Tje service you get from Dharam at the lobby bar is off the charts!!

People are very friendly, room service is great and you can easily get a cab to city center and be there in 10 mins.",5,2018,01,24
213,Great Hotel,"Everything was great, with one small exception ~ we arrived on an overnight flight and were exhausted upon arrival. The hotel was gracious in allowing us to check-in early, but ~ construction and jack hammers right outside our window didn’t allow for much needed sleep. Thank goodness for the fabulous Nespresso coffee system in the room!",5,2018,01,24
213,Home in Dublin,"For me, the Herbert Park Hotel is home in Dublin. Great service, value for money, efficient and friendly staff, and convenient location. I have tried 5 other hotels in Dublin and this is still the best. I only go somewhere else when it is not available. ",5,2018,01,24
213,"Beautiful Hotel, great staff and delicious food with a couple of minor adjustment PERFECTION.","I am a graduate of Shannon College of Hotel Management and have worked and stayed in some of the most beautiful 5 star hotels in Ireland, UK and US. I have to say this certainly felt like a 5 star hotel.

When comparing this hotel versus other 4 star hotels it stands above in terms of quality of service and high standard of food and presentation. 

The staff were very friendly and efficient. Most specifically the front desk and their bellmen. 

The food in the restaurant was amazing and the mocktail and drinks were beautifully presented. 

Only a couple of small gripes. Firstly at dinner it took longer than it should have it taken (Sitting for 10 minutes before we were greeted)  for one of the waiters to come see us for a simple drinks order and they had passed us a number of times spending time chatting with other guests instead of taking our drinks order. Once our order was taken the service was efficient and timely and the food was simply delicious. One of the staff although efficient did not smile once throughout the whole evening and could have been a bit friendlier.  

I booked a twin room. The beds were only a couple of inches apart and the room was rather small. However the room was immaculately clean, beautifully decorated and well equipped with accessories and toiletries. 

No iron in the room and the iron provided after requesting from front desk was leaking badly. As it was quite late I didnt bother to call for a replacement. 

Breakfast was spectacular. A beautiful white linen set up on the tables and a vast array of food options and really attentive staff. 

This set me up perfectly for the days business. 

So overall this is a great hotel, in a great location in Dublin. 

I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone looking for superior service, food and location. ",5,2018,01,23
213,One night in Dublin,Clean and nice hotel with a good full english breakfast buffet with possibility to order omelettes and large variaty of fruit and yoghurt. Complimentary water and Nespresso brewer at in the spacious room is very good. Nice and serviceminded staff. ,4,2018,01,23
213,Very good central Dublin hotel,"A great modern hotel, my room had a lovely view of the park, and everything I could have needed ( the electrical adaptor was a great help). Every member of staff was friendly and helpful. Lively bar in the evening. ",4,2018,01,23
213,"Best Breakfast seat in Dublin, overlooking Herbert Park...","We stayed in the Herbert Park Hotel last week, the location is fantastic - walking distance to town, across the road from a couple of nice pubs with some super restaurants within walking distance too. Value is apparent, competitive room rate, affordable drinks and food. Best of all is the breakfast room which overlooks the Park. Even on a rainy weekday in January, it was pretty, on a Summer morning with the garden in bloom and the windows open, it must be fantastic.
Nice Staff, Silva in the Restaurant at Breakfast Room and Aine Hughes in Banqueting were fantastic. Goof value, great location and the best Breakfast in the City",5,2018,01,22
213,Great stay as many times before!,"Extremely friendly and helpful staff, very clean room, good bed quality, very silent air condition, silent outside, Nespresso machine in the room, missed slippers, but they would be available, adapters in the room!",5,2018,01,18
213,Favorite Dublin Hotel,"Good location, good rooms, friendly efficient staff, wonderful ambiance, good lobby food and wonderful breakfasts - why go anywhere else? We are repeat visitors to this hotel, but we also occasionally stay at a couple of other leading Dublin hotels, mostly because of location - airport etc., but this is our favorite by far.",5,2018,01,17
213,Jan 2018,"Lovely venue, great value for money as there were 10 of us travelling for business. Great location for what we needed and within walking distance to shops, restaurants and the DART. Lovely staff, great food and great service. ",5,2018,01,16
213,Excellent,"Really enjoyed our trip - everything went well, staff very friendly, room very comfortable, food excellent. Would definitely stay here again. (Why do they make me pad out this review with extra characters?)",5,2018,01,15
213,Imelda & Pat,"We are regular visitors to Dublin both on business and socially. We frequently stay in the Herbert Park hotel and will continue to do so. The staff are friendlt, the food is excellent and the rooms are of exceptional standard. ",4,2018,01,15
213,Cork visitor,"Value, location and quality is unbeatable.
Staff so discreet and helpful. Even local b&b’s are not as reasonable price wise. Only down side is paying for parking - I think that was not always the case and it is an extra cost . ",5,2018,01,15
213,Marathon100,Great service. Hotel is in a nice area. Staff is excellent and very friendly. Top service orientation. A real benchmark.Quality of breakfast and catering during the meeting was very good. The hotelroom is quiet.,5,2018,01,13
213,Roundtable event at Herbert Park Hotel,"My company held a meeting Herbert Park Hotel today, and I have to say that the team exceeded expectations.

The meeting was due to place internally, but due to increased interest we had to relocate.

The Herbert Park team were helpful, both before the event and after.

Perfectly set-up room according to specs. handed over.

Would consider them in the future.",5,2018,01,12
213,Well worth the visit,"We spent the New Years eve weekend at the hotel and were very impressed with everything,  The cleanliness of the rooms and premise, the helpfulness of the staff and the overall great environment.  

Dublin over New Years eve is a crazy town but this hotel is situated just outside the craziness in a very quiet area which has everything one needs.  Great local restaurants and pubs.  

Even though it appears to cater to business travelers, it was a perfect romantic  getaway hotel.",5,2018,01,11
213,Visiting Dublin,"The Herbert Park Hotel is very good located. The staff is nice and helpful. The breakfast is good and has gluten-free alternatives as well as full Irish. It would be nice to have showers instead of bathtubs. However, the coffee maschine in the room is a lovely treat and it is a plus. Comuting by bus to downtown takes less than 15 minutes. There are also good restaurants in walking distance. The weather was not so inviting, but we had a little walk on the park, which is lovely.",4,2018,01,10
213,Great ,Great hotel. ..really handy for aviva stadium and surrounding areas . ..room clean. .staff very attentive. ..car parking on site is a bonus. .. no negatives whatsoever. .will definitely use again when we are next in the area ...thank you ,5,2018,01,08
213,Nice rooms with excellent breakfast,"Spend a long WE in Dublin. The hotel is very nice, the rooms are nice and clean. The breakfast is excellent in choice and quality, completed by the view on Herbert Park.
Quite location a bit away from city center but with good access via public transportation (stop <500m away).
A few very nice Pubs and excellent Restaurants in close proximity.",4,2018,01,08
213,Comfortable and enjoyable stay,"Very comfortable and enjoyable stay. Upgraded our room as it was an anniversary stay coinciding with business in the EDS. Appreciated this touch. Bar quite expensive, more expensive than the mini bar which I didn't expect however the mini bar was very convenient. Room was clean Nx spacious with a lovely view of Herbert Park. Receptionists on both check in and check out were excellent very friendly and helpful. Only major gripe is that we had to pay 24 euro for parking for two nights, I understand that perhaps they want to deter patrons from parking there who are not staying but it should be free for those who are spending the night. ",4,2018,01,08
213,One minor fault,"The hotel was beautiful although very quiet, which is probably normal for this time of year. My only fault was the bathroom only had a bath with a shower curtain, for such a modern hotel the bathroom could do with some updating. ",4,2018,01,07
213,Simply the Best,"We are well acquainted with the Herbert Park over the years but it never loses its appeal. The prospect of a Dublin trip staying in the Herbert Park whets the appetite and quickens the pulse as much now as it did 15 years ago. Ideally situated in the heart of Ballsbridge, it is a relaxing environment but is on the doorstep of such a very vibrant nightlife - definitely the best of both worlds. Check in is always professional and friendly and the rooms are well appointed modern and clean with good TVs . I love the quiet ambience of the bar which is an ideal starting and ending point for a Ballsbridge night out. Big and airy with attentive but discreet staff and a relaxing atmosphere. To sum it all up I’d say it’s the hotel we are always either glad to have stayed in or sorry we didn’t choose. Bravo Herbert Park we will be back soon! . ",5,2018,01,06
213,Absolutely love the Herbert Park Hotel,"Firstly I love the location you can walk around the park behind the hotel which is in a nice neighborhood so you are safe. It is close to coffee shops , a pharmacy, a convience store and plenty of nice restaurants. Also around the corner from the hotel you can get a bus to Dublin for shopping which is only a few stops away.. The Staff at the Herbert Park are extremely helpful with calling you a taxi or helping with any queries you may have.. ",5,2018,01,06
213,A Perfect End,"We finished our two-week long holiday at Herbert Park and it was a comfortable end to a great vacation. The proximity to all that Dublin has to offer as well as the near pubs, restaurants and parks was wonderful. All the front desk personnel offered amiable conversations as they helped us with questions and accommodations.",5,2018,01,05
213,Great Service!,"Traveled from the states and stayed at the Herbert Park Hotel to celebrate a friend's 50th bday. The stay here only topped off a spectacular time. A special shout out to Dhorom, who was incredibly accommodating and whipped up some lattes after the bar was closed. The rest of the staff was friendly, helpful and even my single room was spacious! Would highly recommend this hotel.",5,2018,01,04
213,Top Quality Hotel,I stayed in the Herbert Park on new years eve it a good quality hotel its safe clean with great staff handy car park and 40 min walk from O'Connell's bridge. The breakfast is served in the restaurant overlooking the Park. It is convenient for city center R.D.S. Aviva Stadium Bord gais theatre.,5,2018,01,03
213,Excellent location and staff,Everything was great during my 1 week stay. The staff and room service were excellent and the printer available at the ground floor was very helpful to complete my tasks as it is my first time in the country and I had several documents and forms to print. The only thing that was not so good was a little bit of fresh paint smell in the room that I believe was coming from the recently painted doors inside the room. But nothing that diminishes the overall performance of the stay.,5,2018,01,03
213,Great location,Great location in Dublin - easy access to the city centre. Lovely park beside it for walks.  Good choice for breakfast. My only fault would be that the single rooms aren’t quite as comfortable as their double rooms,4,2018,01,03
213,New Year Break,"Very enjoyable visit between Christmas & New Years Day. Room very comfortable & warm. Particularily found be very comfotrable. Did not eat in restaurant but found bar staff very attentive.
Excellant location & easy to park. Minor irritation in having to have parking ticket verified each morning or when leaving hotel. ",5,2018,01,03
213,New Year,Another pleasant stay in the Herbert Park The complimentary glass of bubbly was much appreciated A great location to the City Centre Breakfast is superb with great attention to detail and dietary needs catered for We will be back,5,2018,01,02
213,Excellent hotel,Excellent hotel rooms spacious and clean. Was in a great location and was nice a quiet. Staff were friendly and helpful. Can't fault the hotel on anything and would stay there again if I was travelling to dublin,5,2018,01,02
213,Lovely but pricey,"We were on a family trip to Ireland (two adults and an 8 year old) when we had to head into Dublin unexpectedly as we lost the bag containing our passports.  So our budget was scrapped because we just need to find a room in the city for two nights which proved to be fairly difficult in Dublin in the summer.

We ended up paying 194 euros per night, including taxes, which was well over our budget however, the hotel was beautiful.  I was especially in love with the bathroom.  Parking was an additional 12 euros per night.

We did eat a late night meal in the hotel lobby lounge - I found my meal quite good however, my husband didn't care for his.  There were also quite a few restaurants within walking distance of the hotel.

While in Dublin, we took the CityScape hop-on-hop-off bus as they had a stop very near to the hotel (stop #15 - on Merrion Road).  Note that this tour does not operate in the winter

Overall, a lovely stay even if expensive..",5,2018,01,01
213,Very Good,"Frequent visitors to the Herbert Park Hotel and always had a most enjoyable stay. Staff. brilliant,efficant and very friendly. Very central location and adjacent to the Herbert Park where you can enjoy lovely walks.",4,2018,01,01
213,Comfortable & pleasant stay on the edge of the park,"We recently spent 6 nights at the Herbert Park Hotel over Christmas 2017 and had a very pleasant stay. We spent most of each day with family who live in Ballsbridge, so Herbert Park Hotel was ideal. We have stayed at four other hotels in the vicinity but Herbert Park Hotel is by far the best we have stayed at for visiting in Ballsbridge.The room was comfortable & well appointed with comfy beds. The breakfast buffet had an array of fresh dishes to choose from and each evening I would look forward to breakfast the next morning, not only due to the good choice available but also the lovely setting overlooking Herbert Park. All in all, a lovely stay. Thank you to all staff on duty during our stay.",4,2018,01,01
213,Herbert Park Review,A beautiful hotel about 5 minutes by car from Grafton Street and about 10 minutes from Dundrum Shopping Centre. There are lovely restaurants within walking distance which we always avail of as Breakfast is expensive and is generally not included in the rate.,5,2018,01,01
213,Very noisy rooms,Very noisy rooms got no sleep on 3 day stay better hotels for 1/2 the price in Dublin lounge area can be cold and drafty.  Staff all very helpful and nothing to much trouble.  Just very expensive price to pay when you get no sleep ,3,2018,01,01
213,Excellent hotel - but hot breakfast needs to be better !,"Hotel is in an Excellent location in a nice part of the City overlooking a lovely park; check-in staff very efficient and helpful; room was really nice; food in the lobby really good albeit the service a bit slow and considering the prices, one would expect that a baileys coffee would be served hot (not warm). My only suggestion is that the 'hot' breakfast be re-assessed - for just under €40 for two, it should be top-class !. The bacon was terrible (and we had breakfast at 8:30am so not like we were at the back-end of the service) and a number of the large plates need to be replaced as they are badly marked. Otherwise, a really nice stay and would definitely return but next time will go round the corner to Roly's for breakfast.",4,2018,01,01
213,nice place,"Hotel was nice, though rooms need a little updating.
Reception staff were very pleasant and welcoming, as were dining room staff.
Bit of a wait when going for drinks in the evening but the staff were all very friendly",4,2018,01,01
213,Do not choose this hotel at Christmas,"This is a really lovely hotel. The rooms are fabulous, the service is faultless. The breakfast was very posh, overlooking Herbert Park in central Dublin. It was alos reasonably priced. Unfortunately, I chose to stay there with family on Christmas Day for dinner and an overnight stay. Really, it could have been any day of the year. There was absolutely no Christmas atmosphere, no Christmas music, and from the minute we sat down to our Christmas lunch we were repeatedly reminded that the bar would be closing at 8pm. If the owner of this hotel feels so anti Christmas why doesnt he/she just close the hotel instead of misleading people that there might actually be a Christmas experience to be had.",3,2017,12,31
213,Excellent hotel,"I thought that this was a Spotless hotel, excellent service and quiet location. Extensive bar food menu and high quality food. It has a very convenient location. There are shops, pubs, pharmacy and hairdresser nearby. Would highly recommend the hotel having stayed there several times. ",5,2017,12,31
213,Very Good,"We have stayed here at Herbert Park several times previously. Location, efficiency, friendliness of staff and cleanliness are always first class. Everything works as It should do . Staff are very attentive. 
One small negative: Bathrooms can be a bit on the small size .

213,Recent visit,Relaxed visit made possible by great welcome & team of friendly professionals. Clean environment. Central location. Good room size comfortable bed. Spacious hotel lobby & lounge. Adjacent to Park overlooked by dining area.,5,2017,12,31

213,Good value hotel in Dublin,"Modern hotel, clean and spacious room. Beds are very comfortable.
Not in the center of Dublin. We had to pay for parking (12 euros for one night). Parking is covered and secured but other hotels in the area offer a free car park.
Personel helpful.

213,5 star service,We had a wonderful stay at the Herbert Park Hotel and would highly recommend to anyone. The service and location were excellent. Perfect for a visit to Dublin in the heart of Ballsbridge. Thanks to all!,5,2017,12,30
213,Good as usual,I always stay here when I have to stay in Dublin. The location is excellent with good restaurants in walking distance. Also having the park nearby is good for unwinding after meetings. The staff are friendly and helpful.,4,2017,12,30
213,Lovely hotel,"Lovely hotel, very nice room, good location, great staff, the park and playground is a nice bonus but the cooked breakfast was disappointing; streaky rashers, cold sausages, hash browns were like rubber.",4,2017,12,30
213,The Herbert Park fit the bill !,"The Herbert Park offered comfort, excellent service and good food. Only slight reservation was the temperature in the bar/lounge area was a little low given the cold weather. Perhaps the fact that doors to the area open regularly to allow the outside world in compromised the heating a little. We enjoyed our stay and look forward to a return.  ",5,2017,12,29
213,christmas eve lunch - lovely!,"Family of 6 had christmas eve buffet lunch.  Selection was fabulous and quality very good, particularly the roast goose.  Staff very friendly and all round a lovely afternoon.
Would definitely go again for lunch.  Hope they do buffet again.",5,2017,12,29
213,Academic celebration overnight stay.,"This was a great stay, the only downside was the sounding of the fire alarm in the early am. This appeared to be somewhat poorly co-ordinated as there seemed to be mixed messages delivered to the residents. We did however get a complimentary breakfast. ",4,2017,12,29
213,Good hospitality,Good hospitality from staff. Breakfast is good. Room cleanliness is good. Room is bit costly. Location is near to my business place. Park outside hotel is beautiful to see in the morning after woke up.,4,2017,12,29
213,Excellent Accommodations,We spent our last night in Ireland at the Herbert Park Hotel and were very impressed by the luxurious accommodations and quality customer service. The Herbert Park Hotel is located in an upscale neighborhood near international embassies. It appears to be a safe area to walk and explore. I would gladly return and recommend this hotel to friends and family.,5,2017,12,28
213,General Observations,As previously stated we were disappointed that the bar closed at 8pm on 25th December. The hotel itself was very nice and we were delighted with our rooms and with the helpfulness of your staff who were very efficient and polite. The breakfast was very good and the Christmas lunch menu was average and it did not feel like it was Christmas Day. The staff were friendly and always helpful and we enjoyed walking around the park after breakfast.,4,2017,12,28
213,Great hotel in a great location,"The Herbert Park is a very good hotel that is ideally located for access to the city, Aviva Stadium, RDS and the lovely Hebert Park beside the hotel. The check in was very quick and friendly, the room we had was very comfortable with a king size bed that came with good pillows. The bathroom was as expected, clean with a good shower. Unlike many other hotels the TV had a reasonably wide range of TV and radio channels. A coffee machine was an added touch. We had lunch in the bar, the menu would satisfy most tastes, the food was tasty and good value for what we had. An issue with a fire alarm in the morning took some of the gloss of our stay. However on check out the staff were very apologetic about what had happened and offered a full explanation as well as making a deduction to the bill. Overall I would have no problem recommending the Herbert Park Hotel and will be back.",4,2017,12,28
213,Lovely hotel with very friendly & helpful service,We stayed at the Herbert Park Hotel over Christmas and it was a great break.  The location is excellent as you are beside Herbert Park but it is also walking distance into the City Centre yet not on top of the night life.  The service provided was very good and the rooms were very clean. The lounge area is quite big for family / friends getting together.,5,2017,12,27
213,Quality time hotel.,"I had a perfect stay. The staff is very friendly and helpfull. The restaurant where the breakfast is served does have a beautiful view of the park. I had also a very nice Christmas lunch. 
The only thing I did not like so much was the airco in the room especially during this period of the year. Would be nice if this could be turned off. ",5,2017,12,26
213,1st Class,My wife and I stayed at the Herbert Park Hotel for two nights.  We were delighted with the room and the accommodations.  The room was nice sized.

213,.Excellent Hotel. Very Convienient,"Frequently use the Herbert Park on business. Great hotel. Excellent staff who always remembers you name. Rooms very clean and recently upgraded. Breakfast great. Lobby area is looking good for Christmas. love the Nutcrackers. Although I will always rate it a 5, the lobby area is a bit too much like an airport check in terminal. However staff and location more than compensates for this",5,2017,12,21
213,Great hotel,Although expensive the quality of service is excellent in every respect. Hotel is located in a lovely area. There is an excellent spacious and modern lounge to enjoy a quiet drink at the end of a busy day. Rooms are excellent and great food too. ,5,2017,12,20
213,Weekend stay,Excellent location  nice walks in the park close to bus routes not too difficult  to get a taxi even though it was a concert night. Staff were very friendly throughout the hotel.

213,Excellent location,"The service is one of the best I have experienced on a visit to Dublin. Whenever I am due to go to Dublin the Herbert is always checked first for a vacancy.
The room was spacious clean and fresh.
The location is one of the best in Dublin a short bus ride to the centre. The grounds are peaceful and relaxed you could easily forget you were in a city.
I liked the location the best I am a tea drinker and would sooner a kettle than the coffee maker to brew tea.
",5,2017,12,18
213,Very enjoyable again.,"Lovely weekend in Dublin made all the more enjoyable by our stay at the Herbert Park Hotel.

213,Birthday Treat @ Herbert Park Hotel,"Very nice Hotel. Excellent staff, room perfect. Parking very good. Only bone of contention was dinner menu, dull & uninspiring. Loved the surroundings & took excellent walk in nearby Herbert Park after breakfast. Would readily recommend",4,2017,12,17
213,brilent," stayed at this hotel again and my experience was the same as my last visit well kept  warm welcome  room was perfect  and hotel is well centered to everything ie pubs restaurants bus etc  and lovley location",5,2017,12,17
213,Luxury stay amazing price,Stayed at Herbert Park many years ago revisit was worth it. Modern hotel taxi ride from main shopping 10 euros  if weather had been warmer could easily have walked to shops and eating places.  Will definetly be returning again ,5,2017,12,17
213,Great hotel,Everything was very good in the hotel. The room was very tidy and clean. The breakfast was amazing. In addition to the food that was available at night in the restaurant at the lobby. The staff were very welcoming and helped whenever i has a question. ,5,2017,12,17

213,High class hotel in a great location ,"I will start with my favorite: Nespresso machine in the room. That's for me the great touch.

The hotel looks really nice; the rooms are specious and nicely decorated. Everything was very clean. The lobby, the bar and the restaurant were beautiful too. It was nice hanging out at the bar.

They also know how to look after their guests. The staff does a great job.

Nonetheless if you like jogging the vicinity of the park makes this hotel the best starting point.

In conclusion a great place for staying while visiting Dublin.",5,2017,12,12

Happy to return anytime. Great location. Lovely bright rooms. nice breakfast. Top staff.
Herbert Park always a joy to walk in any time of year.",5,2017,12,11
213,Comfort in an excellent location....,"I stayed here on a short business trip to Dublin.

The hotel is in a great location in Ballsbridge, just off Merrion Road and beside Herbert Park & the RDS showground. It's (just about) within walking distance of the City Centre (2 miles from Temple Bar).

I had a single room, which wasn't huge, but was warm & comfortable and had everything I needed. The bed was a small double rather than a single which was good.

I didn't eat in the restaurant at night, but the breakfast was great, well prepared and presented and plenty of it. And if there's a nicer view to have with your breakfast in Dublin than Herbert Park on a sunny winter's morning I've yet to see it. 

The staff were efficient and helpful whenever I needed them.

The underground carpark costs €12 overnight for hotel guests which is about average for Dublin city centre.",5,2017,12,11
213,Very pleasant experience,Wonderful location - really pleasant experience. We had a room overlooking the park. Wonderful breakfast choice. Staff exceptionally courteous and helpful. All good! We will certainly return when in Dublin.,4,2017,12,11
213,Nice first visit to Dublin made special by such a good hotel,"Nice and clean hotel with good size rooms. Busy bar and great breakfast. Walking distance from city center, a pity that the taxis do not always come to the hotel to pick you up. Very service minded, Multi-lingual and friendly staff.
",4,2017,12,11
213,A winter visit,"Overall I like this hotel, stay very regularly. Very clean, great location, good beds. I didnt like looking over the car park and over front reception as being near Christmas it was very busy  and I woke a few times at night as people exited the hotel. However as it was Christmas time it was excusable. I would and willbe returning as the hotel is very well run.",4,2017,12,10
213,great,"I did enjoy all the experience . the location was great. The personal service very good and the food just yummy: please do try the Christmas pudding -a fabulous desert at the hotel restaurant. the park near by- great view :)
 ",5,2017,12,10
213,Non competent staff,"It was not possible to be offered with a brekfast before 7 am. 
Non competent staff in the reception. They even didn't know how to print an invoice.
After a few days I still didn't receive a right document which was promised to me during check out.
Very noisy heating. ",3,2017,12,09
213,Business trip,"Very helpfull staff, great location for me, (near The Oval), but the room was bit small. Not sufficient variety of food during breakfast, for example not enough vegetables. Hotel is a good choice for one night during business trip.",4,2017,12,09
213,Great hotel...poor staff & service,"Great hotel, location and quality of rooms is second to none. Unfortunately staff and service is poor. They are highly imposing for you to leave a tip at every opportunity. Staff have poor english and not friendly.",3,2017,12,08
213,Really comfortable hotel in Dublin,"This is a beautiful property where to stay in Dublin. I was there for a conference held in a nearby hall (The Royal Dublin Society), so, location was almost everything when making the choice. But, I got so much more! great breakfast, nicely appointed room, with the cutest amenities, comfortable bed and immaculate bathroom. The hotel has an old time flavor, it is quiet and elegant. Staff is very professional and attentive. I totally recommend this hotel.",4,2017,12,06
213,Interesting business hotel,"This hotel is located somewhat out of the centre, requiring to take a taxi to the business district. It offers nice rooms and the possibility to enjoy a light lunch. Unfortunately I had to leave at 5 am for the airport, so I did not have the opportunity to find out how their breakfast is.",4,2017,12,06
213,very satisfying stay,Once again Herbert Park Hotel lived up to our expectations. On arrival the reception staff could not be more helpful and welcomed us back. We were allocated a beautiful room overlooking the adjoining Herbert Park. This is a lovely amenity and must be visited during your stay. While we did not eat in the hotel on this occasion we always found the food to be of excellent quality. We were given a complementary glass of champagne in the very comfortable lounge area and server by bar staff with lovely personalities. The location of the hotel allows one to easily  access the cities amenities and we used bus and taxi to visit city center.  Had an excellent sleep in the very comfortable bed and the the fact that there was no external noise was really appreciated. We have recommended the hotel to many of our friends and they always have been very satisfied. ,5,2017,12,06
213,Weekend,"Great Hotel always a pleasure and look forward to returning as soon as i can afford it.
Staff were great.
The only issue i would have with the entire stay would be I could not find an ironing facility in the room. Maybe this is a facility I simply was not aware of.",5,2017,12,06
213,Always a winner,Stayed here for an overnight last week having visited on a number of prior occasions. The hotel is ideally situated in Ballsbridge with pubs and restaurants close by. Friendly staff and a good standard of accommodation is on offer at a good price point. A slight issue with noisy AC but I have no doubt that we will return soon.  ,4,2017,12,06
213,Great weekend break hotel in nice area,"Lovely hotel and very friendly staff.  We really enjoyed our stay in the Herbert park hotel . This is our 2nd visit and we like 
to be out of the hussle of the city centre. Good 
choice of bars and restaurants nearby. Excellent safe area with easy bus access to the city centre.
",5,2017,12,06
213,Wonderfully undertstated - Perfect!,"I have stayed here many times in the past and always enjoy my stay.  The hotel is conveniently located near family, has parking underground, and is not far from city centre.  The decor was a little spartan in the past, but has been updated with more carpet, room dividers, and seating which makes the lobby much more appealing.  In comparison to the other hotels in the area, it is much better value for money and much more sedate and private.   It really is a hidden gem although seems to be getting much more popular!  The rooms are of a good standard, clean, and have nespresso capsule makers which I really liked.  Overall, small improvements could be made in regard to mattress toppers/pillow topped mattresses for beds (quite firm and springy), more toiletries, and cheaper cocktails (over 12 euro for mojito that was all ice) to compete more effectively with nearby hotels and restaurants.  All in all a good stay and will be back!",4,2017,12,05
213,"Good hotel, great location, excellent staff","I stayed here with friends for a weekend. Hotel is well located, on the aircoach route for anyone travelling to/from the airport, really handy! It’s a short taxi ride into town from the hotel which is very convenient for shopping and going out. We arrived early the day of our booking and landed at the hotel hoping to be able to drop our bags and head into town until we could check in that afternoon! However, the reception staff were unbelievably accommodating and let us check in right away which was much appreciated after an early start! We were also offered cupcakes as a welcome (to celebrate the Ireland/Argentina rugby match), which was a lovely touch! Room was spacious and clean, beds comfortable, loved the Nespresso machine and USB charging points! Some of the decor could do with a little modernising but overall I would stay here again happily!!",4,2017,12,04
213,Lovely hotel,"Great location, lovely hotel and very friendly staff. The location is Ballsbridge is ideal for all of the pubs, restaurants and amenities nearby. Rooms are very comfortable. The staff are very friendly and helpful also. ",5,2017,12,04
213,Room on arrival / Breakfast experience,"Unfriendly staff 
Poor customer service 
Poor Room facilities and amenities on arrival after requesting and paying for an upgrade . 
Terrible breakfast experience 
On check out we were charged for bar items for which we never consumed during our stay . ",1,2017,12,04
213,Super experience,"excellent location, friendly staff, easy access to all amenities, we have been coming to the hotel for many years and look forward to returning again in the near future.We would also strongly recommend to our friends ",5,2017,12,04
213,Great Service,Great location helpful and friendly staff. Very plesant stay. I would highly recommend. They had a fire alarm issue and they dealt with it in a professional manner. The good access to the city with good transport links.,5,2017,12,04
213,Very good overall,"Excellent facilities and cleanliness. Rooms are spotless and comfortable. Like the nespresso machines in the room. Breakfast is quite good. Parking is a bit annoying, particularly as Google maps directs you to the side hotel entrance where there is no parking and you then have to go out and get on to anglesea road. This was my first time driving to the hotel so I found this irritating as I needed to check in in a rush so that I could leave again to attend a meeting.",4,2017,12,04
213,BEST HOTEL IN DUBLIN,The Herbert Park has maintained the highest standards through out the 10 years we have visited Dublin. It is the most peaceful and helpful hotel we have visited in Europe. Everything they do is done with just the perfect balance of efficiency and helpfulness. The bagel breakfast in the lounge to so well presented that it worth the trip in itself. ,5,2017,12,04
213,Satisfied,"Rooms and hotel itself were very great quality - clean and nice. The staff was very helpful and polite. We had no issues staying there and the location was very, very convenient. 

I give it 4 stars, because there was no spa or sports facilities and for the price someone might expect :) 

I think target customers are business people - they had conference rooms and restaurant looked nice. 

The location was great - close to the city centre, but in a relatively quiet area. Right next to RDS and good restaurants in the area around the hotel. 

One great thing - right next to the hotel is the oldest Irish rugby pub, where I enjoyed few pints of local brew :) 

Overall, I am happy for choosing this hotel and would go again in case I need to visit RDS again :) 

",4,2017,12,04
213,Good location,"Stayed for quick Dublin trip in early December. Hotel is a great location, handy for town and south dublin. Car park is a little tight, but plenty of spaces. Hotel is an odd shape, which doesnt lend much to space on ground floor, but functional. Rooms are spacious and very clean.",4,2017,12,04
213,Old fashioned,I found the hotel quite old fashioned in decor and quite behind times.  The location was good a short taxi ride to down & the staff were helpful.  The room could of been cleaner as I found the coffee cups were dirty.,3,2017,12,03
213,Herbert,"Hotel staff are excellent nothing is too much trouble 
Hotel cleanliness excellent especially bedrooms 
Nice rooms very clean and comfortable and spacious 
Will stay again 
Parking is a little tight underground ",4,2017,12,03

213,Excellent as always,"Best hotel in Dublin for value, efficiency and friendliness. Seamless check-in and check-out. The experience across the board was notable for staff friendliness and can- do attitude. Looking forward to next stay.",5,2017,12,02
213,Ideal for the rugby,"Located within a short walk to the Aviva stadium and a longer walk to downtown Dublin.
All staff were friendly and helpful. We were able to sit down in lobby area until after 3am without any hassle.
Breakfast adequate although I have to say I missed baked beans with my cooked breakfast! One of those things which are usually there and missed when not! 
The room -202- I had was large and comfortable and had nice touches such as an espresso machine. The view from room was not one to write home about as overlooked building site. May be worthwhile asking if hotel has rooms overlooking Herbert Park. 
Nice friendly hotel ideal for a weekend stop-over especially if going to Aviva stadium.",5,2017,12,02
213,City break,Return visit to Herbert Park. Always stay here in my visit to Dublin. Staff are excellent and so welcoming each time I stay. David on reception and Jan in the restaurant are wonderful. Highly recommend ,5,2017,12,01

The room was clean and comfortable. the location was perfect for Aviva, city centre (bus stop 2 mins walk and takes 5 mins to Grafton st Eur2.80 ) I would highly recommend and I cant wait to stay again in the near future.",5,2017,12,01
213,Weekend Break,"Stayed here with my wife for 2 nights at the end of November. Very good hotel, large, clean rooms and very good breakfast. Only downside was we were located beside the lift, and were woken by some loud guests getting out of them late on the Friday night.",4,2017,12,01
213,nice room - poor breakfast for the money!,Stayed 2 nights.  After a mix up with my booking my check in experience was not great - no feeling of warmth or of being welcomed.  Lovely spacious room  with a good temperature control. The breakfast quality was average - expected better for the price.  Sandwiches at lunchtime weren't much better.  Great checkout experience though.  ,3,2017,12,01
213,Excellent as always,"Excellent stay as always. I stay on a regular basis due to work and it never disappoints. The breakfast is fantastic, the room very clean and the bed very comfortable. Staff friendly and remember me. Superb location. ",5,2017,12,01
213,Wonderful experience - 50th Birthday Celebration,"We have had a wonderful time at this hotel. I booked the Indulgence package as a 50th birthday treat for my husband.

Upon arrival, there was a great buzz in Reception, which was beautifully decorated for Christmas. The staff were extremely courteous, and wished my husband a happy birthday - and upgraded us to an Executive Suite. He was thrilled. The room is big, with a jacuzzi in the bathroom. Everything is spotless- and there are lovely bathrobes and slippers.

We enjoyed prosecco and canapés downstairs - and we are looking forward to breakfast in bed tomorrow.

The location is great - so central. We were able to walk to the restaurant we booked in less than two minutes (we booked Rolys - which was superb), and had a choice of great bars close by.

We will definitely be back - and would highly recommend this hotel for a special celebration. ",5,2017,11,29

213,Not a bad hotel,"Service needs to be improved upon slightly.  The lobby is pristine, however, I didn't get that clean hotel smell from the rooms even though the room looked very clean.  The location is great - especially if you are going to a rugby match or want to be a little away from the city.",3,2017,11,28
213,Perfect stay,Very comfortable bed and room very tidy and warm. Bathroom spotless and everything that we needed there. Breakfast was great and a lovely variety. Staff very helpful and courteous. Hotel in great location for shopping and rugby match. ,5,2017,11,28

213,Argentia Rugby Match,I must say that the food was fabulous.  I have never seen such a selection of food for the breakfast.  The staff were very friendly and could not do enough for you.  Excellent location for the match but even for the shopping in the city centre.,4,2017,11,27
213,Exceptional stay,"This no fuss hotel its simply one of the best for business travellers. The welcome is always genuine and everything it says on the tin they do and works. Extremely clean and comfortable rooms, staff are always warm, friendly and caring. Location is marvellous, safe, convenient and easy to get to and from. I would highly recommend this property and congratulate the wonderful team there who run such a well oiled machine and care for their guests so well.",5,2017,11,27
213,Wonderful trip,"My first trip to Dublin was just perfect. I chose The Herbert Park due to its location being close to my conference venue. I am so glad I did. I cannot praise the staff enough for their friendly, efficient and perfect service and attention to detail. I loved everything about the hotel: the room was comfortable spacious and spotlessly clean; the bed provided an excellent sleep quality and the food in the restaurant was of excellent quality. I hope to return one day to Dublin and will certainly choose the Herbert. Thank you everyone!

",5,2017,11,27
213,"Very nice place, both interior and exterior are neat and fresh.","Describe the service you experienced – absolutely helpful and polite personnel. Special thanks and congratulations to Egle, Siva and Ioawa, perfect job. 
Tell us how you liked the room – very nice, nothing but good, thank you.
Talk about the location & amenities – just perfect, if you like to walk around. Not too far from the down town about 20 - 30 minute walk. Several grocery stores close to the hotel, several bars, restaurants and pizza place that works till very late. Several numbers of buses that can take you downtown if you are not a very walking person. 
Say what you liked best – very helpful front desk/ reception personnel. 
Say what you liked least – nothing that I’d remember.",5,2017,11,26
213,It's alright,"The room is mediocre, I came to Dublin for a weekend for a family occasion and really only needed a comfy bed. I assumed by the price that it would be half decent but I am really disappointed! Carpets also look like they need to be replaced so at least fix that or provide slippers. Pretty gross. 

Food was also not fantastic, but at least there are loads of places nearby to eat.",3,2017,11,26
213,Couldn’t be more helpful,"There are times when I’m loathe to recommend gems that I enjoy staying in as I sometime feel these reviews contribute to increase prices and demand. 
This time I am honor bound to give a glowing review. I arrived with a broken leg and everything that could be done to make my stay more comfortable was done. I got a bigger room  than I had booked, extra duvets were supplied immediately and with a smile. This is a top class hotel across all categories. ",5,2017,11,26
213,Close to city centre & next to nice park,"Very nice hotel next to the park. Distance to city centre is less than 10 minutes. Rooms are ok, but works are ongoing to extend the hotel and I got awake every morning early because of the works. I would not recommend to visit it during the works, but as soon as works are finished I will try it again.",3,2017,11,25
213,Dublin for Business,"Very good hotel, good location, you must try it . I was here for business and I chose this hotel since it is very close to the officies I had to visit but it has been anyway an optimun solution and I'm sure, when I'll come back to Dublin even for holiday, I'll come here",5,2017,11,24
213,An oasis in city,"Quiet, relaxing place to stay whilst on a business trip to Dublin.  Staff in particular are most welcoming and top class.   Nice location with plenty of options for getting in a walk in please t surroundings I the evening.   ",4,2017,11,23
213,November in Dublin,Perfect - from start to finish - we have stayed in this hotel on many occasions and have always found the staff and facilities to be excellent - this stay lived up to the very high standard that we have come to expect.,5,2017,11,22
213,The Staff at this hotel are the best,"Ms Anna (Irish spelling) Mr Dominic, Mr Eli..(do not remember the spelling of the name) at the reception.  All was brilliant for my 9 days stay. The food was great, with big portions that I am not used too coming from Switzerland :-) ",5,2017,11,22

213,Peter,Great place to be while in Dublin. The room are warm and staff are welcoming the breakfast was really continental and well done. The staff were ready to get me any assistance needed including an iron box that i was in need of. I recommend the facility to anyone travelling to Dublin.  ,5,2017,11,21
213,"Lovely hotel, great location","We stayed here for a week during a conference that one of us attended, while the other had some vacation time. The staff were great - they remembered us and were friendly and efficient, even under pressure. We had an issue with a noisy room which was quickly resolved. Our room was clean and comfortable with good beds and a TV that worked. ",5,2017,11,21
213,Good hotel for business,"Overall nively located close to RDS
Nice bed and confortable furnitures
Friendly staff, special thanks to Elmas.
Food is.... average. Breakfast is correct with lots of choice. Try to avoid the single tables at the window in the morning as these are really dark early in the morning in the winter season.",4,2017,11,21
213,Great stay,"Fantastic hotel, great service, friendly staff.  Excellent location next to Herbert Park in Ballsbridge so away from the hustle of the city but at the same time close enough to walk into city if feeling energetic.  Would definitely stay again when visiting Dublin",5,2017,11,21
213,A Breakfast fit for a King!,"Very nice place and well located. We walked into the town mall and it took us around 30 - 35 minutes, an easy walk. Plenty of taxi's around if you prefer not to walk. If you're staying for a game very close to the arena probably a 10 minutes walk.
 The rooms are a good size, very comfortable and are the beds. Bathroom was good not too small. 
The breakfast was all freshly made food with lots of choices, everything you could amagine excellent!
All the staff were excellent no complaints would definitely come back.",5,2017,11,20
213,Lovely hotel in great location,"There seemed to be a lot of noise from other rooms and the corridor, on a few occasions we heard sma phone ringing in a different room, another occasion there was someone speaking on the phone, not sure if it was housekeeping staff but there was frequent noise from outside our room. ",5,2017,11,20
213,Supurb hotel in fabulous location,"Excellent as we have come to expect. Despite the hotel being extremely busy due it being a rugby weekend, the quality of the service and the attention to detail never faltered. Clearly the training which staff received was excellent.",5,2017,11,20
213,Short but Sweet Stay,"From the moment we arrived ,we were looked after by the excellent staff.  The car park attended was very helpful in guiding us to an available parking spot (busy weekend for parking with the rugby match!) . Check in  and check out was completed in a matter of minutes and our queries managed without hesitation, by the friendly staff on reception. Our room was comfortable and spotlessly clean. Food was delicious.  We  really enjoyed our visit to the Herbert Park hotel and will return!! :)",5,2017,11,20
213,Herbert Park Stay,Generally an excellent hotel. I was slightly taken aback when bar staff refused to make cocktails because they were too busy.  Overall the hotel is really clean with modern fresh bedrooms and generally friendly staff. The underground car park is a bit tight for space. Breakfast is excellent in a bright and spacious breakfast room with very attentive staff.,4,2017,11,20
213,Executive Luxury,"Fantastic location right in the heart of Ballsbridge. Our room was spacious, clean and comfortable with stunning views overlooking Herbert Park. This created a relaxed and calm atmosphere which is very unique for a busy City centre property.  Food, staff and location were all top class and I will be returning again. ",5,2017,11,20
213,Very nice hotel!,"We enjoyed our stay at the Herbert Park Hotel, staff were very helpful when we needed to ask something and room was very comfortable.  Our only issue was it seemed to be a fair distance from many things, but a few taxi rides took care of that.",4,2017,11,19
213,"Nice and quiet, but still so close to it all.","Herbert Park Hotel is only about 20 minutes walk from downtown Dublin. I stayed there last Easter and I was quite happy with the location. Most of my friends who go to Dublin (and we Icelanders go there often) stay somewhere downtown - and by downtown I mean literally as close to the famous Temple Bar as they can. But the also frequently complain about noice and no privacy. I did not have to worry about that at Herbert Park Hotel. The lobby is grand, and the bar / restaurant area is excellent. I had dinner at the hotel restaurant 2 nights out of 5 - preferring to eat there than downtown. The room we got was big, with view to the river and the staff was very professional and nice. The nice stroll down town added to the pleasure of staying at the hotel - most of all I liked being a little bit away from the noice of downtown Dublin.",4,2017,11,19
213,Very nice and modern and convenient location,"I stayed here while attending a conference at the Royal Dublin Society (RDS) conference center which is only a five minute walk away. Not only does that make it super convenient, but there are several pubs, restaurants, coffee/bakery and ""fast casual"" salad places also on the same block and across the street. The bus stops are very close by. It can't get any easier than that. 

My room was a good sized room with a king-sized bed. It was an end unit facing the street (see the photos). I took advantage of the Nespresso in the room. There were plenty of hangers in the closet, which is not the usual case in my experience. At one point it seemed that the heat stopped running so I called and after a staff member came to check the thermostat, they restarted it and it worked after that.

Food at the Herbert Park was pretty good. I had an excellent lamb shepherd's pie, fish and chips, and afternoon tea with scones and finger sandwiches in the Terrace Lounge, which always seemed to be busy. They make a good mocha too.  Breakfast is in the Pavilion Restaurant overlooking Herbert Park, offering a peaceful start to the day. I only wish breakfast didn't end at 10 am (I am not a morning person!).  The breakfast buffet is good but I'm probably spoiled by the breakfast buffets at hotels in Asia. They offer the usual western options including scrambled eggs but they make them more runny/wet than I like; however they will make an omelet for you if you request. I would rate them higher on breakfast if they had an actual omelet bar.

I wish I'd had more time there, to take some walks and enjoy the park and enjoy more of Dublin. Just have to come back some day!",5,2017,11,18
213,Calm and comfort,"An enjoyable and restful stay of 3-days that helped me quite a lot to prepare and participate in the fast and packed schedule of a global forum. I had the opportunity to make small talks and meetings with work associates in the spaced and quiet environment of the hotel bar and dinning area. Very well designed, managed and serviced almost all day.",5,2017,11,17
213,Nick&Lynn Rugby weekend,"Great Hotel and Great staff.
Ideal location for sightseeing Dublin but Excellent for attending the Rugby International venue at the Aviva stadium, 10 minutes walk on the flat!
All the staff were more than helpful and efficient without being intrusive, a good balance! staff
The room was spotless and housekeeping staff helpful and friendly too!
Breakfast at the Herbert Park was something else with beautiful views over Herbert Park.
Looking forward to our next visit.

213,Great business hotel,"I stayed for 5 nights during a business stay and the hotel was clean, comfortable and food was good.  Great location for the RDS .. although on rugby weekends the lobby became a bit of scrum !.. and someone kindly signed for a lot of drink using my room number !",4,2017,11,14
213,Lovely stay in a great location,"We stayed here on a Sunday night as we were going to dinner and a show. The location is great, and especially at Christmas time - the hotel looks beautiful. Check in took about a minute (brilliant!). The room was classic in design, clean, and well equiped. Buffet breakfast was nice in the morning, we probably came down a little too late though. Next time I would pay the extra €5 and order from the a la carte breakfast menu.
The staff are really friendly and helpful. Checkout was also a breeze. 
There's a gorgeous park Herbert Park right beside the hotel which is lovely for a stroll after breakfast. 
One negative was the shower - the nozzle kind of sprayed water everywhere and the shower curtain was constantly getting stuck to me. But a pretty minor thing!
Overall a lovely stay and we will 100% be back",4,2017,11,14
213,NS,"This was my look-see trip to understand communities in Dublin 2, Dublin 4 and communities in the DART route.  Walking access to DART, good restaurants in the area and access to Herbert Park made this a great location.. In some days the room rate was too pricey.",5,2017,11,13
213,Business Venue with Personalised service,"Herbert Park continues to be our ""go to"" property for business in Dublin. The facilities and location are sufficiently flexible to work for a number of group requirements.

The staff couldn’t be more friendly or helpful. ",5,2017,11,13
213,Pre match warm up!,"Called in to the Herbert Park prior to attending the a rugby match in the nearby Aviva stadium. The hotel was modern, clean and contemporary. Plenty of room to sit and stand through from the bar to the lobby. A variety of bars available so no long queues. All the staff were welcoming, polite and efficient, we even availed of the complementary cupcakes and whiskey! Can't recommend it highly enough!",5,2017,11,12
213,Wonderful hotel,Beautiful hotel in Dublin near the RDS and beside the lovely Herbert Park. Very comfortable room. Beautiful breakfast available. Excellent customer service.

after very well. The location is perfect for business,rooms always very clean and regularly 
upgraded. I would highly recommend this Hotel.",5,2017,11,12
213,Best Caesar Salad Ever !,From the moment I entered the lobby the gentleman at reception was courteous / friendly / efficient. I had a lovely Caesar salad and a glass of Sauvignon Blanc.. probably could have been a little more chilled. The Nespresso coffee in the bedroom was superb.,4,2017,11,12
213,Fantastic hotel,"We travelled to Dublin for a show at the Rds ,the hotel is right on the door step so no need for a car,the hotel is fantastic  and the food very nice,we have stayed in many hotels and I would rate this as one of the top hotels in the UK.will will be going back for a family break before Christmas work permitting,can't recommend this hotel enough.",5,2017,11,12

I would recommend this hotel for business or leisure trips.
Definitely will stay again.",5,2017,11,10
213,Very pleasant stay,"While on a business trip I spent 3 weeks at the Herbert park hotel. Everything was clean, the room was big enough, WIFI signal was very good, they even had a travellers power socket which was very convenient.

Breakfast had everything I wanted. The only thing I thought could improve is the Vegan options in the restaurant. The chef did make me a nice salade.  

The hotel is located next to the Aviva statium and station Landsdowne road. Very handy when you want to travel by train. Besides that, there are several restaurants and bars nearby. Also had a nice morning run in the park. Gym is pretty small but has all the essentials. 

Crew did remember by breakfast preferences which made me feel welcome.",5,2017,11,08

I was on a business trip and the location was perfect for me. It is a few minutes from the city center though, but surrounded by restaurants and shops. Overall excellent quality.",5,2017,11,08
213,Great Weekend ,"Once again a very enjoyable stay at this Hotel. Rooms are clean, spacious and very comfortable. Underground car parking is very convenient and staff at check in are very helpful.

",5,2017,11,07
213,Matt review,"Excellent all around, staff was spectacular. 

My only issue is with hotel's paying for parking which this hotel does.  I personally think all hotels should have free parking but other than that this place was top notch",5,2017,11,07
213,"Great location, incredibly helpful staff","A short taxi ride out of Dublin the Herbert Park exceeded my expectations. From enabling an early check-in to ordering taxi's and generally enhancing all aspects of the Dublin experience the staff at the Hotel were fab. The rooms are large and comfortable, the lounge relaxed and attentive. Great Hotel, great location, will definitely staf there again.",5,2017,11,07

Brilliant location and great staff always very well looked after love staying at Herbert park 😍",5,2017,11,06
213,Perhaps a bit too corporate for me …,"Perhaps a bit too corporate for me … Although perfectly clean and welcoming, I would have enjoyed a bit more local personality (interior, decoration, design, people). I lacked a more ‘real’ impression of Dublin in the hotel.",3,2017,11,06
213,Herbert Park Hotel - Lovely Hotel,"Twin room - beds are too close to each other! 
Breakfast at €19 is pricey - there is a lot of variety but only so much one person can eat for breakfast.  
Hotel staff were helpful and friendly. 
I used the gym which was good.  
Hotel is in a great location. ",4,2017,11,06
213,Pleasantly surprised ,Was very impressed with this hotel. The staff were very professional and friendly. The rooms were beautifully decorated and so comfortable. Very reasonable. Parking wasn’t included which was disappointing but at €12 it wasn’t a big issue. The lobby bar was buzzing and staff very attentive. Will definitely come back for my next girls get together.,5,2017,11,05
213,Excellent hotel in Dublin,"Have stayed here many times now and have always thoroughly enjoyed my stay. Secure underground car park very reasonably priced for hotel guests. Rooms bright, modern, spacious and quiet. Bathrooms are lovely. Bus stop right outside meaning you're at Grafton Street in 10 minutest or a lovely 30 minute stroll. RDS, Aviva Stadium but more importantly great restaurants like Rolys or The French Paradox are right outside the hotel. Staff are excellent..very friendly and helpful. Wouldn't stay any where else if I'm being honest.",5,2017,11,05
213,Hassle free and convenient,"Immediately on arrival it was very evident that all hotel staff are well focused on greeting their guests with a friendly smile.

Lots of good local fair to sample within walking distance.",5,2017,11,05

Service was excellent , Rooms were comfortable at a reasonable price . 
The staff : Jan, Candy Dharam   made my stay enjoyable .",5,2017,11,04
213,"Great food, but cold surroundings","Beautiful hotel and staff, but the restaurant was so cold as the radiators were switched off. Food was stunning, but surroundings were very cold. Restaurant only got up to temperature when we were finished eating. Also the first hotel I was ever in where someone else snoring in another room woke us both up.",4,2017,11,04
213,High standards,"Herbert Part Hotel is always a good choice both for business and leisure. It si located close to the beautiful Herbert Park and it is only a few minutes by walk from the city center. Very high standards for rooms, restaurant and services.",4,2017,11,03
213,nice hotel but pricey in certain aspects,"very nice clean, modern hotel with excellent location at the heart of Ballsbridge in Dublin city. Staff were exceptionally friendly, always greeting guests. Expensive parking and breakfast were a let down, other than that, couldn't fault it",4,2017,11,02
213,Marathon stay at the Herbert Park,We booked this hotel due to its location next door to the RDS and the Dublin Marathon expo.  Hotel is very modern and clean as are the rooms.  You can walk into Dublin city centre in under 30 mins or hop on one of the many buses which pass outside the hotel.  The Aviva stadium is a 5 minute walk away. The hotel is also right beside Herbert Park which is nice for a walk around after breakfast.  Hotel staff were all very friendly and helpful. Only downside is you have to pay to park your car in the hotel grounds - 12 euros per night - but this seems to be the norm in Dublin.,5,2017,11,02

213,Over priced,"Hotel is clean & very modern but Very expensive considering breakfast was not included & parking comes at additional cost.And with it being a four star hotel, a basic thing like the TV had little or no reception at night time, other than that the room was comfortable & clean ",4,2017,10,30
213,Easy Decision to Stay at the Herbert Park Hotel,"Very fast check in and check out. Excellent dining experience as well as the availability of the gym.
I wish there was in FULL SIZE blow dryer in every room.  I was very happy to have the bottled water in my room.",5,2017,10,30
213,Nice but sparse,"Lovely location room was great but the reception area was the closest thing to a railway station I ever experiences. Masses of space, acres of it with little to interrupt the eye. To the left was good but to the right was soul-less with no thought put into filling it to make it feel comfortable.  As an entrance, it disappoints and the feeling of cold marble defines the rest of te hotel. It needs rugs and art, couches, lamps and warmer colours. ",4,2017,10,30
213,Great time in Dublin,"Had a great time. Hotel, rooms, and restaurant were great, had exceptional staff in all areas. Great location, within walking distance to some great pubs, would recommend to anyone traveling in or around Dublin ",5,2017,10,29

213,Recommended,"Stayed for a quick business trip, very satisfied with hotel (safe and secure) and staff was friendly. Location is a small drive from downtown but the fact you have onsite parking makes up for that. Dinner at the hotel restaurant was great (fish and chips) and the breakfast spread was impressive for what I have seen throughout Europe.",5,2017,10,28
213,Excellent,I always stay at Herbert Park when I am on a business trip. Very friendly and helpful staff. Clean and quiet rooms. Good quality food. Nespresso machine in the room. Improvement could be: German TV channel.,5,2017,10,28
213,A cut above the rest.,This is a lovely hotel in a great location with the nicest staff you could encounter.  It is within walking distance of the City Centre and superbly located for a rugby trip and RDS events.  I can happily recommend a stay here. ,5,2017,10,28
213,Classy yet cozy,"This was my last stop from a 10 day tour through Ireland.  We stayed at several hotels but this one was the best!  Large lobby to sit and read - atmosphere was cozy but also very classy.  Staff was professional, courteous and friendly.  My second morning at breakfast, Jerry, brought me over my soy cappuccino without me having to order it!  I felt like royalty!  Spacious, well lit with plenty of closet space and the bathroom was stunning, even the shower pressure was impressive.  House keeping staff were so sweet (they caught me trying to sneak a towel from the cart and just smiled and asked if I needed anything else)
Bravo!",5,2017,10,27
213,5 Star Stay,"Just returned from a 2 night stay at the Herbert Park Hotel - It was top class from value, location, cark park, all staff, food, room, and overall atmosphere!

213,Adjacent to a noisy building site,"Very disappointing. One side of the hotel overlooks a noisy building site. As soon as I got to my room and heard the noise, I called reception to ask if they had other rooms available. They promised to call straight back so I held off unpacking. 15 minutes later they still hadn't called so I called them again. Answer: ""Sorry, nothing we can do. It would have been better if you had not booked a single room, because we have more double rooms on the other side of the hotel so we might have been able to move you."" Gee, thanks.

I would not recommend this hotel, at least until the building work is finished (by the looks of things, several months yet).",2,2017,10,24
213,Couple,Hotel was nice and staff were very helpful . Food in the hotel was a bit pricey and wasnt a great selection so we choose to eat in a pub in the area which was lovely (crowes) .

We can think of nothing that was below a superior rating as the room was spacious, immaculate, well-appointed; the breakfast was truly impressive with every possible selection expertly prepared; and the helpfulness and friendliness of the Staff was most impressive.

213,Lovely hotel,We spent a weekend in The Herbert for my brothers birthday and had a brilliant time . The staff were excellent and could not have been any more helpful especially Davide who gave us a upgrade to a very nice room. So thankyou Davide and the rest of the staff for a very enjoyable stay. Would definitely recommend this hotel ,4,2017,10,19
213,Comfortable hotel and good location but no charm,Decent amenities and friendly staff; facilities are ok; no charm as modern and large by European standards; good location. It is average rating as the price is not low either. I have not compared with other Dublin hotels but I have extensively travelled the world over.,4,2017,10,18
213,Good value in Ballsbridge,"A good choice for business or travel, located midway between downtown & University College Dublin, & close to the embassies and large arenas. Our room (for 3) was a sufficiently large, spotlessly clean, & comfortable. There is a nice breakfast buffet available which we took advantage of on days when we had early meetings, a comfortable lounge that serves drinks and food as well. It's about a 15-20 minute walk to central Dublin, and a map of the many tourist attractions there was available. We were surprised that they had no maps of the local Ballsbridge and/or larger Dublin area, or transit maps, nor any idea where we might get one. The staff was friendly and helpful in giving directions or getting us taxis to get to specific places not on the map, but being able to get that info without relying on them, or expensive data plans or spotty wifi would have been great!",4,2017,10,17
213,Great location and very comfortable,"We arrived at 2 a.m. from the Dublin Airport after a flight delay. The night manager was helpful and friendly. The accommodations were very comfortable. We had booked a pre-tour hotel stay luckily so we had a couple of hours sleep before embarking on our only bus tour. We were able to walk the 4 blocks to catch the tour bus. The room was nice and dark, the breakfast was excellent.  We spent a total of 3 nights here.",4,2017,10,16
213,a regular visitor,"Excellent location, friendly staff who always have a great welcome for us. Car parking facilities are very useful particularly on match days in RDS and Aviva. The ambience and attention to detail ensures you will always return.",5,2017,10,16
213,Short leisure stay for Anniversary party,Excellent location for D4/city centre area.  3rd stay here as nothing I could never find anything to complain about this hotel.  There is a lovely park adjacent (Herbery Park of course!) if you want a short strool after a long journey.  Lots nearby pubs and restaurants (which get very busy at peak times). I'd probably rate as 4.5 if that were an option. The finishings are not luxury but all clean and well supplied & fitted.,4,2017,10,16
213,Lovely hotel,"Stayed for two nights for work. Lovely hotel with great staff. Ate at hotel both nights as restaurants nearby all fully booked. Food was really good and we all enjoyed. Quite expensive 19€ for a burger and chips. Same for a Thai curry. 
Breakfast delicious. Really high quality. 
Excellent service. 
Avoid rom 431. It has a generator right outside and it droned away all night. I told the staff and they moved me with no fuss or bother to room 411 which was lovely. My friends were both on 5th floor and enjoyed their jacuzzi baths. Jammy things. 
",4,2017,10,15
213,Fab Dublin,"As always the Herbert park was the fab choice for a weekend in Dublin, fantastic room and fabulous staff with the top Dublin breakfast . We love the Herbert park and can't wait for our next stay. The young lady at reception (Ionia I think ) a lovely Romanian member of staff who made our stay a fantastic experience.Thank you.",5,2017,10,15
213,Dublin 2017,Nice hotel/location. Breakfast nice but hot food cold unfortunately every day. All other items very good. Only other issue was lack of suffient towels. One hand towel for 2 people seems skimpy.  Other than these somewhat minor issues everything else great. ,4,2017,10,15
213,Great Time,Great stay and a beautifuul location which is nearby some great local restaurants and only a 10 minute cab ride from Temple Bar and Trinity University.  We will be back!  This is a great option if you are traveling to Dublin for a rugby match as well as the stadium is nearby.,5,2017,10,13
213,Great hotel,"Great place to stay, friendly staff, comfy bed, very clean, central location and good food. I cannot reccommend it enough. The lobby is ideal for  alate night drink while sitting on comy sofas and breakfast is delicious with good variety of foods.",5,2017,10,13

My room was spotless and the nespresso machine in the room was a welcome surprise. The staff was polite and professional and went the extra mile when I left a gift in the lobby when I was checking out. I'll definitely stay here on my next visit to Dublin,5,2017,10,11

213,"Quiet, Clean, Comfortable","Spent six nights here while on business in Dublin. The hotel is modern with clean, quiet, comfortable rooms. My room included a US adapter which was a nice touch. The hotel is a little off the main tourist area so it might be a bit of a walk to get to locations such as Guiness Storehouse, but, in general, it's about a 15-20 minute walk to most of the sites. The staff was friendly and very helpful. The terrace lounge was fantastic and not a bad value considering how expensive just about everything is in the city.",5,2017,10,10
213,The Rubgy,"

Great location, great ambiance but reckon prices changed on the night seem ed excessive compared with other properties in the Dublin 4 area. Given the price, additional fees for parking leaves a slightly sour taste.

",4,2017,10,10
213,"Nice, friendly, practical hotel by the park","Staying at Herbert Park was a very good experience - rooms quiet and comfortable for great sleep (always a plus for me!), next to the park, easy facilities for meetings, not too difficult to walk to town and situated around several restaurants nearby. 
Really convenient and nice. ",5,2017,10,09
213,great hotel,"great hotel in a great location. The staff however make it excellent. Very friendly and helpful. I would have no problem recommending this hotel which is very well run and exceptionally clean and comfortable
",5,2017,10,09
213,Great hotel,"I have been staying at this hotel for a long number of years! I stay regularly in Dublin and I find this is the best hotel for me. Every time I go there I find it is my home away from home. The staff from the front desk to the foyer and the restaurant are always very attentive and friendly. They know what I have for breakfast every morning without having to ask!. The hotel is in a great location close to great restaurants and pubs! A highlight for me is the proximity to the Herbert Park which is a great amenity to have on the door step of the hotel, particularly on summer evenings. A great hotel, with great staff and well worth a visit. I keep going back there!",5,2017,10,09
213,Business trip,"This hotel is perfectly located right next to Herbert Park which provides an opportunity to walk either before or after work.

213,An exctllent stay,"Me and my wife were staying for a combination of first wedding anniversary and show at the RDS. The hotel is located perfectly for the RDS. The staff were briliant from arriving,bery friendly and helpful. The hotel and rooms looked lovely and were clean. The only thing was the room was very warm, there was ac tho amd it was quiet so didnt disturb us. And my wife didnt like the pillows. But very minor complaints and more down to personal preferance. I thpught the pillows were nice! All in all great place, would stay again and recommend very highly.",5,2017,10,09
213,Good location - but expensive,"Hotel is in a great location, is clean and staff are friendly. Breakfast room is beautiful with lovely views onto Herbert Park. The room I had was very small (a single bed) and, in my view, significantly overpriced - even parking was extra - Dublin will begin to suffer soon if hotels continue to charge these outrageous prices",3,2017,10,08
213,Comfortable Hotel in Ballsbridge,"Hotel with a nice lobby area and rooms that are big and comfortable.  Free Wifi all over so no need to try and remember the codes.  All staff are very courteous and professional.  My only spoiler is the 07:00 breakfast and pity it does not start sooner, even room service is not before 07:00 (but then you have a €6.50 tray charge slapped on).  Nevertheless making up for the late breakfast opening is the combo of Spanish and Brazilian ladies at breakfast duty.  Very helpful smiling and cheerful, nice way to start the day - Gracias y Obrigado.  You know who you are so go tell your management !",4,2017,10,08
213,Bring your own hairdryer,"They have hairdryers that need to charge - work for 2 seconds n then start charging again 🙄 
The hotel was lively and the location is perfect as we just strolled into the city centre which took about 20-25mins - staff very friendly n room spotless ",3,2017,10,08
213,Well run hotel,Well run hotel friendly staff. A little on the expensive side but worth the money. It is a good 20 minute walk to the centre of Doublin but if you do like a walk it is very easy and you go through the best part of Doublin. ,5,2017,10,07
213,Excellent,"Excellent treatment from everyone! Dharam, Arne and Jane take care of everything perfectly. Lovely place.

The location is good and the quality of the breaksfast is amazing.

Will come back here in the future.",5,2017,10,07
213,Break with family,Really enjoyed our short stay at the hotel.  The room the service and breakfast were all great.   Hotel in a good location for visiting the city. Great restaurants close by ie Rolys for example which is one of our favorites.   We would definitely visit again.  ,4,2017,10,07
213,Great Hotel in Ballsbridge,"Great hotel, only issue was the room was small however typical for most  hotel rooms in large cities. Arrived early after international flight. Staff assigned us a room quickly so we could rest. Nice bar after a long day of sightseeing.",5,2017,10,06
213,Top rate,"Rooms were beautiful. You are welcomed with a shot of Baileys Irish Cream! Very clean. Staff was very nice and helpful. We had to leave prior to the 6:30 breakfast, however, the staff made sure we ate before we left. Coffee, juice, cereal, fruit, muffins and cookies. One of the nicer 4 stars in Dublin. ",5,2017,10,06
213,Very nice location outside of downtown Dublin,"Very nice place, very efficient check in - that included a shot of whisky!  Made it all very nice.  Everyone was very nice - from the front desk to the bellhop.  all helpful and friendly.  The hotel is outside of the the ""downtown"" Dublin area.  There are still plenty of places to visit and eat, but getting into downtown is a bit of an effort.  the hop-on-hop off bus is about a mile and a half away.  
But thought the hotel was great and provided a beautiful room ( with air conditioning) ",5,2017,10,06
213,Excellent,The hotel was modern and the service was excellent. The room I had served all my expectations and was excellent.

213,One night wonder,"I stayed at the Herbert Park Hotel in Ballsbridge on Saturday last with my wife. 

I'm familiar with running events at the hotel and was confident that it was worth the price. We were greeted by friendly staff on arrival and even offered an upgrade to a larger room on the 5th floor when we mentioned were were there to escape from our children and just needed a rest.

The room was as good as I have seen in Dublin, boasting quality furnishings, a large bed, lightly stocked minibar, decent wardrobe and a super tree filled view over this posh part of Dublin.

We did however have noisy neighbours, staying on the same floor, who woke us up at 4:45. Not the hotel's fault..and just goes to show that some people have no manners or respect for other guests. 

We reported the disturbance on check-out and were offered apologies and a validated car park ticket (€12.00 value) as compensation. We were expecting a little empathy, and were delighted with the free parking. 

Overall, this is a beautiful hotel, with experienced and professional staff and the promise of a luxury experience in one of the nicest parts of Dublin.",4,2017,10,03
213,Herbert Park Hotel in Dublin,"The service was excellent. When we arrived, the porters were there to take our luggage in and brought them to our rooms.

213,An oasis of calm in the bustling city that is Dublin.,"The Herbert Park Hotel is a little oasis of calm in the bustling city that is Dublin. Located in Ballsbridge it is only short walk to the City centre, the main shopping areas and many attractions. Ballsbridge has plenty of lovely bars and restaurants on the doorstep. The hotel is well maintained and al the staff are courteous and helpful. The variety at the sumptuous breakfast is awesome. Hope to be back for more soon  ",5,2017,10,02
213,Good and Quite hotels near beautiful Herbert Park,This hotel is just near the beautiful Herbert Park so it's very convenient and nice to walk through the park everyday. Breakfast is above average. Room is big as expected and clean. Very nice experience,4,2017,10,02
213,No complaints thanks to one particular member of staff who was very helpful,"Ask for any available offers for that night,  when they are quiet they can put on offers which are very good value for money.  We got breakfast, car parking and a bottle of Prosecco  thrown in for very little extra cost",4,2017,10,02
213,Thanks again,"As always great staff thanks for the excellent service

213,Lovely clean hotel. Would stay again.,"Lovely hotel, clean and modern rooms and very friendly staff. I liked this Hotel because of the cleanliness of the bathroom and clean bedrooms. Nice eating area and very convenient to RDS. The parking was reasonably priced and I was able to stay all day even after I had checked out. I travelled here whilst working in Ballsbridge and will definitely stay here again.",5,2017,10,01
213,Nice hotel with one current drawback,"This is a very nice Dublin Hotel, a nice walk from the city centre, but beware that construction work is taking place a the neighboring lot for a considerable time and they do start quite early in the morning eg. 7.30. Even inside the hotel the noise is heard during the day. But if you are out - nothing to worry about.....",4,2017,10,01
213,Lovely bright hotel,"Lovely bright clean hotel. Great staff, very friendly and helpful.  Nice lobby area to sit in. Lovely walks in the park near by. Rooms clean and bed comfortable. 
Breakfast,  good choice and great view of Herbert Park. ",5,2017,10,01
213,Good location and great quality,"Been to Dublin may times but would always recommend Herbert Park as place to stay.
Good and enjoyable walk to town centre is part of the fun but local eateries are great too.
Dublin in the sun( have I been lucky so often or am I too used to Welsh rain?) is unbeatable and the strangers uniformly kind and often amusing. Reputation of the Irish wit and charm are well -founded.",5,2017,10,01
213,Great hotel friendly staff,Very nice hotel helpful staff. Dharam and Samu in the bar and restaurant made our stay and dinning experience very good. Located in a good area of Dublin close to the city centre. Local restaurants and bars her good as well.,5,2017,09,30
213,No flexibility,"Hotel was chosen by recommendation because of an event there.
The event was cancelled - room rate (prepaid) was not refundable.
Other hotels in such a situation show more flexibility and concession in such a situation.
Finally they could sell the room twice.
Poor reaction!!!",2,2017,09,30
213,Excellent staff and an enjoyable pre- AND post-match venue,"As we were going to the Leinster match we dropped in for a pre-match drink and the staff and atmosphere was so enjoyable we headed back afterwards for some bar food. The menu was good and food was all enjoyed but the stand out points were the staff, particularly Dharam who was friendly, helpful and a pleasure to meet - truly understands customer service and was charming with it!

We particularly liked how the coffee was served with caramel slices which were gorgeous and the presentation was delightful too. Great location for the match and for Ballsbridge area which was jumping that night. 
A good hotel is certainly made great by excellent staff though!",5,2017,09,30
213,Great Hotel,"The personnel was very kind. Hotel and guest room clean. I had no issues during my stay. The location is beautiful, outside the hotel there is the bus stop for city centre. I recommend it for business trips.",4,2017,09,30

213,"My first choice for a business meeting, a drink, and a quick bite to eat","The hotel lobby lounge is lovely - bright, stylish, and relaxing.

I also really appreciate the staff. Dharam and Romee are great! They are always friendly and always remember me and my drink of choice. I travel to Dublin often and usually have at least one business meeting at the hotel while I am in town. I'd recommend ordering a coffee as the way it is presented is very special and comes with a delicious treat.",5,2017,09,29
213,Gem near city center,Great hotel in upscale area near city center (walk or take bus).  Rooms are convenient. Lobby restaurant has very good food.  Dharma and Samu (evening) and Agla (breakfast host) were outstanding.  All staff are friendly and helpful.  This is our fourth stay at this hotel.,5,2017,09,29
213,Excellent staff ,I really appreciated that you approach of the staff… Nothing was too much effort… I particularly appreciated the way in which Domnic (from  Croatia) at the front desk went out of his way to connect and offer a top class service. Well worth using when in Dublin City ,5,2017,09,29
213,Great hotel near American embassy,A gine hotel near the American Embassy but requires a long walk to city center. Not many restaurants near by. Hotel food very good quality. Staff friendly and helpful. Our room had no view but a wall. ,4,2017,09,29
213,Excellent hotel service,"The hotel could be anonyous, one among many other but its crew makes all the difference. Very nice teams in morning - going the extra miles for ensuring the customer feels as close as possible from home; very efficient team at reception and at the bar  - Dominic, Eglea, Siva, Romec and Dhavan to name a few.

Very good evening crew as well for later diner, again going the extra mile to ensure customer gets food or drink.",5,2017,09,28
213,Lovely hotel,Ladies and I adore this hotel so we decided to meet up for coffee here this morning. The presentation of their cofee is just beautiful and don't even mention the caramel slice that comes with it. Delish! I don't normally leave reviews but today I must give a shout out to Jan at the lounge area for looking after 20 of us ladies this morning. We've noticed she was by herself but managed to look after us. Thanks Jan. Would definitely be back ,5,2017,09,28
213,Great Place for a Business Meeting & a Bite,"The Herbert Park Lobby lounge is a great place for a business meeting, for locals and visitors alike. Modern, open and very comfortable , excellent food & coffee, and superior service (Dharma and Siva provided the customary outstanding service on my last visit). It has become my meeting place of choice when in Dublin, and I highly recommend it to anyone with business in Dublin as a first choice to impress yourself and those you are meeting with. I've never experienced the hotel as a guest, but I have to assume that the rooms and service for guests of the hotel are as good.",5,2017,09,28
213,Short visit to Dublin,"I had to visit Dublin for the HMI conference at the RDS venue. Herbert Park Hotel was a 3 min walk from there and therefore the right choice. I came in a day before and had a perfect stay at the hotel. Staff is friendly, rooms are great and especially the bed was very comfortable. When you walk out of the hotel you can walk direct into the herbert park which is nice on a sunny day. Visiting the city by taxi is very easy. Taxi and Uber are constantly around bringing you for €10,00 to the temple bar area where you can find nice bars and restaurants. When visiting Dublin I would definetely stay at the Herbert Park Hotel again.",5,2017,09,28
213,Excellent hotel,Hotel in very good location for my business appointments. Spotlessly clean and from General Manager through to all the extremely professional and friendly. The restaurant and bar area are very comfortable with beautiful views to the very pleasant park next to the hotel. ,5,2017,09,28

213,"Couldn’t be bothered, glad I did!","I arrived in Dublin to be greeted by foul rain after a rather annoying flight on RyanAir (shock horror). Checked in. Very warm welcome at reception... I have a Polish name... he spoke to me in Polish! Unfortunately I’m from Middlesbrough and don’t speak Polish but extra points for trying! 

Did the usual business prep and then dragged myself downstairs for a bite to eat. Really wasn’t in the mood at all. Then I met Dharam. I think he read me like a book! He said “sorry we’re closed”. He must have known I love sarcasm because that made me laugh! Then he offered me whatever menu I wanted, but looked and me and basically said “let me get you a burger”. 

He was great... 2 Guinness’s later, fed and feeling much better... I don’t mind telling you I thoroughly recommend this place! Very good indeed! 

Thanks Dharam! And the Guinness was indeed better in Ireland ",5,2017,09,27

213,"Trip of a life time to see this beautiful country. People are friendly, welcoming,lots of good sites. Highly recommend!","The Herbert Park Hotel 4 in Ballsbridge Dublin was excellent. Great price for a luxury hotel. Good food, top service, clean, tasteful,  and  within easy walking distance of the city. Outstanding service from Iona at the the front desk.  She far exceeded her job by making our stay comfortable, gave helpful suggestions, and even got us last min. tickets to Riverdance!  I felt like we had been friends for years.",5,2017,09,27
213,Fabulous breakfast,"Great location,great food,great staff. Ground floor is in good repair however upstairs is shabby. The wallpaper need replacing. I was in a single room which I found quite small and certainly didn't reflect the price I was charged ! Children running and laughing in the hall at 4am........",4,2017,09,27
213,Great Service by Dharam,"Great hotel, excellent service overall.  Dharam working in the lounge was top notch.  Very attentive and friendly, as were all the wait staff.  I like the added personal touch of this hotel.  Clean, efficient and great service.",5,2017,09,26

213,EXCELLENT  AND STAFF EXCELLENT,"i  have been staying with you for the past seventeen years and find your staff most courteous and friendly.  the waiter in the restaurant who has been there for nine years and eggla i would especially like to mention as they have been most helpful over the years. the only issue i have is i never get a special rate even. though people who book later than me always get the hotel cheaper. and a better rate than i do.    i have complained about this a few times before and find even though i am loyal to your hotel and wont stay any where else the loyalty isn,t extended to me.   but for everything else food, staff, cleanliness i would give excellent on each. ",5,2017,09,26
213,Great AGAIN,"Great service, food, location a little gem with great food and service. We had a team dinner for 20+ with lovely service, really good food and choices. We really enjoy the ambience and they make darn good cocktails too!!  See you next year. ",5,2017,09,26
213,"Excellent location, price is good, one suggestion is to put in a better fitness room if possible , but location is great","Excellent location , price was good, staff friendly and professional, one comment is hotel may consider investing in a fitness suite which is larger than the current . Also look at an awards per stay . Thankyou",5,2017,09,26
213,would highly recommend,"The hotel is in a great location , Its a 10 min walk from the RDS. Rooms were very nice and the meal that we had on the final night was very good. I forgot my suitcase and the staff were very helpful too ",5,2017,09,26
213,Nice hotel with spacious rooms but average staff,"The Hotel rooms are comfortable and spacious, good Wifi. Large bar, adequate breakfast selection.
The only thing that could be improved is tthe Service-orientation of the staff. They do their Job but nothing more and not very actively.",4,2017,09,26
213,Great Staff,"I regularly stay in the Herbert Park Hotel when visiting Dublin on Business. Without exception I receive a warm welcome from all the staff, they are extremely accommodating and nothing is too much trouble. Having travelled extensively with business  in my opinion money can't buy this type of service. 
Thanks to all the hard working staff at the Herbert park Hotel.",5,2017,09,26
213,Herbert Park Stay,"For the price of the room, it was large, but otherwise underwhelming.  The decor was drab, the amenities where not best in class, and the room was not very inspired.  No bathrobes, the vanity was far too small, the toiletries were not very nice.  There was the sound of water dripping inside the toilet or tub at night.  I had to shut the bathroom door in order to sleep properly.  The walls aren't very sound proof.  I could hear people opening/closing their door in the middle of the night.  ",4,2017,09,25
213,weekend trip,"very enjoyable stay.On arriving my husband and I were pleasantly surprised,our room was upgraded to the penthouse suite.We were attending a concert at the 3 arena and this made it a very special weekend to remember ,Thank you ",5,2017,09,25
213,Great Hotel,Nothing to complain . Staff are exceptional. Location is perfect you are in the city but the outlook from the hotel  is perfect overlooking the Herbert Park you could be in the country. Bus service into the centre of the city just a short walk.,5,2017,09,25
213,Dublin is very friendly place.,"I've spent a very nice stay at the Herbert Park Hotel in Dublin. The Hotel is situated in a quiet part of town, traffic to the center is simple and fast. The Hotel has very good cuisine. The staff is friendly. The room was clean, well furnished, but sleep on the betting floor brings a problem with the engines from the air conditioning. I was awakened every morning at 6:00. This is annoying.",4,2017,09,25
213,Basic in Ballsbridge,Hotel has convenient location in Ballsbridge. Friendly staff. Good wifi.Tiny rooms...single bed and no desk ! Difficult to work unless you don't mind working on your bed.Also problems with morning taxi's. Good for leisure...would hesitate for business.,3,2017,09,25
213,Three day stay in Dublin,"The hotel is pretty, with a nice breakfast and helpful staff. Located in a peaceful and beautiful environment close to the Herbert Park. The distance to the City Center is the only negative, as by bus it needs 25-40 minutes travel - depending on the traffic.",4,2017,09,25
213,What does this mean?,There was one issue during our stay. Close to our meeting room workers were making a lot of noice outside the building which means that speakers were sometimes hard to understand... So organize the works outside seminar periods should be great                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             ,4,2017,09,25
213,Single Room Standard,"The single rooms in this hotel are of two standards, though this is not explained well on their website, and they both cost the same.  One is very basic, with minimum space and facilities, while the other is similar to their Standard Double Room, but for a single bed.  We were booked in for 6 nights (and expected the higher specification room), and were very unhappy to find the room small and lacking facilities.  Fortunately we did manage to get a better, comparable room for the second and subsequent nights.  Someone else had to suffer !",4,2017,09,24
213,Dublin,"First timer in Ireland. Hotel was slightly outside Dublin but was on bus route and even walkable (15 minutes). I didn't eat at the hotel but there were plenty of fabulous food establishments within and easy walk. The was also a Catholic Church within an airport say 10 minute walk.

",5,2017,09,24
213,Amazing! ,We spent 2 nights here prior to a bus tour. This hotel was fantastic! I've stayed in several places in Dublin and this was the nicest. The staff was friendly and welcoming. The rooms were spacious and clean. The location is slightly outside of the city center but there is a bus station close by and taxis are reasonable. We took a taxi from the northern city center and it was 13 euros. The breakfast was also delicious. We had a lot of variety and great fresh fruit. We will definitely be back. The price was slightly above what I usually spend but worth every cent!,5,2017,09,24
213,EXCELLENT  PLACE TO STAY,"super hotel. great staff. great location and price. lovely atmosphere around hotel. would highly recommend.great food. could do with long mirrors in main bedroom but wouldn't  fault it on that.
me and my family had a great time and on waiting list to go back in November.",5,2017,09,24
213,Great Ballsbride Hotel,"Great hotel, clean, large rooms and very helpful staff.  Located near the US Embassy in the Ballsbrige area with many restaurants within walking distance. Location is also convenient to all coach transportation networks.",5,2017,09,24
213,excellent,"Fine hotel with a great value for money, great location near city center, friendley staff, good and clean rooms with a fine bed, nice bar in the lobby, good for business meetings. I recommend this hotel",5,2017,09,23
213,great experiance every time,"as long as your people stay as friendly and helpful as they have been and are every time I have stayed there, and you keep the accommodations as nice as they currently are, I don't think I will ever stay anywhere else when visiting Dublin. You have and run a GREAT hotel. ",5,2017,09,23
213,Good choice for Ballsbridge,"We had a 3 night stay at the Herbert Park Hotel in early September. We originally booked for 2 nights and extended for an extra day. 

The hotel is a super location in Ballsbridge, across from the RDS, close to town and also numerous bars and restaurants in the area. 

We didn't have breakfast in our rate. It was a bit too expensive at €19 per person. 

There is secure car parking at €12 per day. Day parking is available across the road at the RDS for €7 but they don't allow overnight parking. 

Our double room was nice, if not a little dated. The bed was comfortable and while there aren't as many power points as modern hotels, there was a multi-charging power board which was handy. 

The staff were all very friendly and helpful. The hotel has a more of a business feel to it but overall, a very good stay in a great part of Ballsbridge.",4,2017,09,23
213,good hotel,"Hotel was lovely. Staff were very friendly and accommodating, especially the cleaning staff they are a credit to the hotel. Car park/ breakfast very expensive at least one should be included in price . Double room consisted of two single beds put together, matteresses were two different heights made for an uncomfortable sleep which was unfortunate. Gym needs an upgrade. Aside from the latter the hotel was lovely would stay again .",4,2017,09,21
213,Happy Times at the Herbert Park,"After a thorough examination of hotel options in Dublin, I booked a conference for 80 people from 30 countries with approximately 60 rooms accommodation, meeting rooms, lunches and evening meals , for 3 days, for mid September 2017. I am delighted to report that the hotel excelled in every way in their delivery of facilities, food, beverages and service.  All guests attending were full of praise for the event, confiming how pleased they were with the quality and standards of the accommodation, the breakfasts, the range of food for lunches and dinner, and most of all, the standards of service delivered by the staff at the hotel. The staff displayed a high level of friendliness and were always on hand to deliver service with a smile in a thoroughly professional manner. Taking into account that the guests were from a total of 30 countries and were well experienced in relation to hotels throughout the world, it was pleasing to hear their notable compliments in relation to the high level of standards and service delivered by the Herbert Park Hotel. Add to this the competitive rates that were made available to us, in summary, this conference was hugely successful. If I ever need to stay at a hotel in Dublin 4 district, or indeed to organise a conference in the future, I will have no hesitation in returning to the Herbert Park Hotel. Well done to the Management and staff at all levels for making ours a memorable experience! I'll be back.",5,2017,09,20
213,Anniversary visit,"We stayed at the Herbert Park for our anniversary. On arrival we were pleasantly informed we had been upgraded for our anniversary - a nice surprise. Breakfast was excellent on both mornings with a great selection of food and great service. Staff for the duration of our stay were very pleasant and helpful. 

My only possible negative from our lovely stay was the price of the parking in the hotel. I felt it was a bit steep for residents. 

However, the stay was very enjoyable and we would definitely stay again and recommend to others.",5,2017,09,19
213,Try it!,"Our holiday was booked through Irish tourism. Every hotel, every B&B. 

Our first night in Dublin was spent at the Herbert. What a great start!

The rooms were large. The lobby beautiful. Located next to Herbert Park a nice place to stroll. And the breakfast buffet delicious ",5,2017,09,19
213,Satisfied customer,Excellent service and very good overall experience. Great location with a beautiful park on the door step. Staff really friendly and helpful. Dinner and Breakfast quality and service excellent. Really friendly and helpful staff. The only issue was that accommodation price was on the high side.,3,2017,09,18
213,Good Hotel in Dublin,I Stayed for 7 nights at the Herbert Park Hotel in Dublin formally Durys Hotel. It is in an nice area with good pubs and restaurants near at hand and only about 15 mins walk from down town Dublin. My room was clean and comfortable the breakfast buffet was very good with a wide choice of both hot and cold dishes. The bar was a pleasant place to have an nightcap and the staff were warm and friendly. I would stay there again when I next visit Dublin.,4,2017,09,18
213,Super place to host an event,I cannot praise Mirka and her team enough for the work and first-class planning and execution that went into our recent events in The Herbert Park hotel. We hosted 70 people in the afternoon and 150 people in the evening. All the team is incredibly friendly and professional and I admire how they changed the floor plan of the room midway through the day for two different events. The food and drink served was of the highest quality and excellent value. A superb venue in Dublin. Please do not hesitate to get in touch if you need further details.,5,2017,09,18
213,Weekend break.,"The hotel is centrally located convenient to all services.Very bright cheerful  & spotless accommodation with efficient , polite and helpful stall throughout  the hotel .Would highly recommend it to my friends & family.",5,2017,09,18
213,Two day Stay,"A modern upscale hotel located in a residential area. A pleasant 15 minute walk to the centre of town. Spacious room with a good view of the area. Friendly, helpful and efficient staff. An excellent choice,",5,2017,09,18
213,Great hotel,"I had a good stay here. Clean, spacious rooms. Nice breakfast. Terrific staff. They also have free wifi available throughout the hotel, including the rooms. Would recommend it, as long as it's commutable to where you need to be.",5,2017,09,18
213,Shower in bath,"Nice hotel, great location, friendly staff but surprised to find shower was in the bath in an ""Executive"" room. And if you must have a bath, make it a normal size: way too narrow for normal person. That said, everything else was great.",3,2017,09,18
213,Wonderful!,"The room was very nice and comfortable, the breakfast very good, the staff was really very kind and helpful. The overall accommodation was pretty and stylish. I definitely would go back again sometime.",4,2017,09,18
213,Fun in Dublin,We were part of a tour group so I don't know what rate we paid.  Extremely clean hotel and nice and quiet for a good nights' sleep.  Near a bus route which would have been much cheaper to use than a taxi to get to the center of town.,5,2017,09,16
213,Superb,"Stayed here as a very good location on Dublin's south side. Great underground parking so convenient. We were made feel very welcome at reception. The room was so comfortable, stiff cotton sheets and a nespresso machine. What more could we want. Will be back. ",5,2017,09,16
213,Lovely hotel,Lovely hotel. Great location. Booked a room without breakfast but would have liked one at the price of the room. Excellent location for the RDS with really good parking. Very comfortable bed. With a great sized room ,5,2017,09,15
213,Good business hotel,"Chosen for its location. Room and Hotel was good. However, extremely expensive compared in relation to the room and general appearance of the hotel. Breakfast (not special) was at additional cost and just to park your car was at additional cost to the already expensive room. Bathroom needed basic maintenance (as example)",4,2017,09,15
213,Excellent Hotel and Amazing Staff,"I had an amazing stay at the Herbert Park Hotel. I found the staff to be most welcoming and friendly especially Martha who was responsible for my floor. She was very attentive and a pleasure to talk to as were all of the staff. The room was impeccable. Loved my fresh coffee in my room every morning!! Def a plus in my eyes!!
Thanks again!! I will be back!!",5,2017,09,14
213,I will come back,Very nice staff! It is a good sign that they are still working there after you come back for the 5th year. Overall a great place to stay. Nice location with the park next to the hotel. Good infrastructure. Small but good gym. ,5,2017,09,14
213,excellent,"An overall good experience.  I had a clean room.  The hotel has very friendly, helpful staff.  It is an  excellent location for the RDS.  Parking is very good.   Also the proximity to the city centre is a major plus.",5,2017,09,14
213,Wonderful hotel!,"Wonderful hotel! I would stay here again as my first choice and recommend it to my friends. Staff was very professional and helpful. Location was great, within walking distance of restaurants and transportation.",5,2017,09,14
213,Nice hotel,"The staffs of Herbert Park Hotel are friendly and nice. Herbert Part Hotel is next to Part, it is a great place to take rest after work. I would recommend my friends to stay at this Hotel and the breakfast is so delicious. ",5,2017,09,13
213,Visit,"Good location, local area nice , hotel VG overall. The building work next door can affect you weekdays with early starts.

Park next door very nice for a stroll also walk round the canal to see other bits of Dublin",4,2017,09,13
213,"An excellent hotel, my first choice every time !","As a regular business guest at this hotel, the staff, the room, the food, cleanliness, facilities, car park and the check in / out process really can't be beaten. 

Each and every member of staff from reception, to restaurant/bar to housekeeping are so friendly, welcoming  and professional - rooms are great and good value too.

My only complaint is that the hotel books up quickly during the week and sometimes at short notice rooms are sold out (although they always try their best to fit me in) and I'm forced to go elsewhere...but Herbert Park is always my first choice.

",5,2017,09,10
213,Not a business hotel,Hotel provided the lowest wifi speeds or no coverage depending on the floor or room. Cheaper hotels offer better service. Despite the Hotel claiming to have remedied the issue a lot of our delegation experienced slow or no speed connections,1,2017,09,09
213,Vey Good but not Great,"Herbert Park was as good as I remember it all of 11 years ago but let down by the variable quality of the food in the Terrace Lounge variable - the Chowder was fine, the Baked Salmon good, the Shepherd's Pie fair and the Battered Cod poor - the batter too thick and overpowering the fish which was not as white and moist as I had expected.",4,2017,09,09
213,Birthday celebrations,"Wonderful hotel, very helpful staff and lovely rooms. Only about 15 euros for a taxi into the centre, would definitely return again! Gerrard on reception was extremely helpful and polite! All in all a wonderful trip with excellent service ",5,2017,09,09
213,Exceptional,"I do a lot of travelling and stay in many hotels. I now find myself benchmarking all others against the Herbert Park. Where it excels most of all, is in the quality of staff, who are exceptional. They are friendly and helpful and always make you feel welcome. This is now my hotel of choice when I visit Dublin. The hotel should be very proud of the staff they have working for them.",5,2017,09,08
213,A Rare 5 Star Rating,"I don't know that I've ever given a hotel a 5 Star Rating but Herbert Park Hotel deserves 6 Stars! 

This is a well situated hotel with very pleasant outdoor surroundings and close to the convention center. The hotel is spacious and clean -- you get a good feeling when you drive up and enter the lobby.

The front desk service was excellent and even though my room was not available (I arrived mid-morning) it didn't take long for them to accommodate me. Meanwhile, their restaurant is excellent. 

My room is spacious and clean and the bed very comfortable. Slept well! 

I've enjoyed lunch twice while staying here -- while yesterday the French onion soup was not ""the real thing"" (and rather disappointing) today the Goat Cheese Salad was outstanding! Also, the Americano coffee is excellent and that's something I'd rarely say. 

Wait staff -- polite, energetic and immediately attentive.",5,2017,09,08
213,Great Hotel in a very lovely location,"You can't often go wrong picking a hotel near the US Embassy and this is no exception.  The staff were always friendly and attempted to be helpful.  They could have been a little more knowledgeable about the bus system, but they tried.  The room was exceptionally clean and set up beautifully.  The hotel is quiet in a quiet area.  Bus service is close and several very good restaurants are within a block - Rolly's is a must.  We stayed 5 days and slept better than ever.  They set us up with fresh bottles of water daily and the Nespresso machine was wonderful and restocked daily.  ",5,2017,09,06
213,Lovely spot,"Lovely hotel, great location and parking outside the door.  Staff were friendly and the rooms were spotless. Walking distance to RDS and a number of nice bars and restaurants. Lovely park right on the doorstep. ",4,2017,09,06
213,"Quiet and comfortable, top-notch housekeeping","We had one of the executive rooms on 5th floor. It was quiet, spacious and the housekeeping was flawlessly good, with total attention to detail. The shower had decent water pressure although we only got to try out the jacuzzi bath just the once: it was fun! There's plenty of storage space for belongings and a safe for small valuables (will just fit a smallish laptop). The bed was maybe a little firmer than I'd prefer, but it was still very comfortable. Big windows gave a view out over the rooftops to Bray Head and the mountains.

The lounge bar was very good, too, but we found the level of service a bit patchy depending on who you got. I don't normally like millionaire's shortbread, but the tiny slivers served up with a pot of tea were the best I've ever tasted, with a creamy caramel layer that just oozed out at every bite. Yum! 

Staff were friendly and helpful. In fact, the only thing I wish Reception did routinely was to tell new guests how to use the lifts. They're the sort where you need to insert your room card in order to make them work. I struggled with it at first, and ended up helping some other guests who'd not quite worked it out either.

The Ballsbridge location is leafy and green - and of course there's a large park right next door. There are plenty of good places to eat & drink nearby. Try a raspberry scone from Roly's for breakfast - they are huge and absolutely delicious. 

It's about a 25-30 min walk in to the city centre, or there are loads of buses nearby which will take approx 10 mins. You are even within a short walk of Dublin Bay via the charming little green at Sandymount, and the Dart trains will take you further along the coast for some spectacular views - try Dún Laoghaire, Bray or Greystones.",5,2017,09,06
213,Great Hotel,"The Herbert park is a great Hotel with excellent food and very helpful Friendly staff, however I would prefer if room rates included Car parking as you think your getting a reasonable deal online until all the extras are added on and then the price becomes not so good, I recommend all hotels do this and then everyone knows what their getting its only a little thing but its annoying, if your paying over 200 euro for a room parking should be included.",4,2017,09,06
213,"Nice location, helpful staff","Overall a very pleasant stay. Nice hot shower! Clean and
modern. The surrounding area had some nice pubs/cafes. Good storage facility also to leave our belongings while out. Room service was a little pricey though ",4,2017,09,04
213,Weekend trip,"Excellent location in Ballbridge, quiet yet conveinent to City. Fantastic breakfast, everything you could want. Rooms were spacious and clean and all staff were very friendly and polite. Will stay again on our next trip.
",5,2017,09,04
213,Peaceful accommodations short walk from center of Dublin,"Lovely, quiet, comfortable Hotel just outside of the City Center.  Rooms are clean and spacious.  Great Nespresso coffee machines in each room make an excellent coffee. A nice breakfast is included overlooking Herbert Park, in a relaxing dining room.  Lots of restaurants just outside the Hotel's front door and it is a 15-20 minute walk to the center of Dublin. Very friendly and helpful staff.  They can also schedule a taxi for you for a fixed rate of 28 Euros total and up to 4 people can fit in the cab.",5,2017,09,04
213,"Great hotel, excellent location","This hotel was included in our CIE bus tour. It is quiet, with a great location, comfortable beds, convenient to pubs, restaurants, parks, post office and has friendly staff and a wonderful breakfast buffet.",5,2017,09,04
213,They think of everyone!,"This place is so lovely! Very nice accommodations, with every convenience considered (plug adapters in room, complimentary Nespresso machine, etc). Staff are very helpful and friendly! Very comfortable stay. ",5,2017,09,04
213,recent visit,My stay was very enjoyable. The location was very convenient. The staff were very friendly and efficient. My room very comfortable but sound proofing from adjoining rooms needs an upgrade. The first floor main corridor décor could do with a revamp.,4,2017,09,04
213,One of the best experiences with a hotel I've had.,This hotel was one of the cleanest and friendliest that i stayed in while visiting Ireland. If I could I would have stayed there more. They really did an above and beyond level in everything. If I know anyone going to Dublin i'm sugesting they stay at Herbert Park Hotel for as long as they are in Dublin. If I get the chance I will definitely book with you again.,5,2017,09,03
213,Beautiful hotel friendly staff,"Immaculate hotel lovely decor and absolutely spotless, didn't eat here but had a drink at the bar and the bar staff on the night were just so polite and friendly they really made our stay here, lovely experience overall",5,2017,09,03
213,Herbert Park Hotel Never Disappoints,"The hotel is well placed for a Quiet stay although you are 5 minutes taxis ride to the centre of Dublin.
The staff are very Helpful and Courteous and having the Park right next door a bonus.
The Hotel and rooms are clean and tidy having stayed with my Mum and Sister.
My Husband and I have stayed 4 or 5 times before and have never been disappointed.
My only recommendation would be to include Breakfast in the Price.",5,2017,09,03
213,Curiosity Satisfied...l,"My wife and I have walked past this hotel many times, wondering what it was like.  Especially as it is in our favourite part of Dublin.  

I got to stay myself for one night as part of a business trip.  I was very, very impressed.  The hotel is sparkling clean, staff are very, very helpful, the breakfast was great.  We had always assumed because of its location, it might be a noisy hotel.  But absolutely not.  I was in an inward facing room and suffered from no traffic noise at all.  The true test of any hotel is how comfortable the bed is, and how good is the shower.  Both were excellent.  

And yet, step outside the door and you are in the hustle and bustle of Ballsbridge.  The accessibility of the hotel is perfect.  

So, should I go back?  Certainly - in fact I have asked to be put on their distribution list for  special offers.",5,2017,09,03
213,Derek palmer review,Great hotel and great location.Great bar lobby area.Rooms ok/clean but could do with updating i.e. new flooring. Room was 130 with no breakfast so a little pricey when you add on 39 euro for two breakfasts as well.Overall a good experience and would recommend the hotel in future.,4,2017,09,02
213,Pleasant,"A fine hotel with comfortable rooms and great service by a friendly and informed staff. Lobby bar is bright , spacious and cheery. Located in a beautiful park. I have always enjoyed my stay at the Herbert Park",5,2017,09,02
213,stay at herbert park,Generally very good but a noisy air conditioning unit spoilt our night... I'm sure you could find a hotel with equal value around the same location. Don't think I would stay there again unless I was sure there wasn't a big air unit belting outside.... ridiculous situation in this day and age. ..,2,2017,09,02
213,Dublin,"Manager was delightful and professional. 
My roommate did not have her luggage for 4 days into our CIE tour of Ireland. Hotel charge of $2.50 plus tax should have been deferred   Otherwise Hebert Park Hotel and staff were perfect. Lounge waiters were Fun and Entertaining. ",5,2017,08,31
213,5 Star,I found the staff very helpful I thought the location was great also the surrounding park was very peaceful I full enjoyed the restaurant for Breakfast and the dinner was outstanding. The hotel is location is a very safe area I was traveling alone and felt very safe going ut by myself.,5,2017,08,30
213,Dublin,"Great from the start. Easy to get to the hotel by bus from airport. Fantastic breakfast area over looking park.
Nice, clean and spacious. Would think you are in a 5 star hotel with this place.

You cannot go wrong.",5,2017,08,30
213,Very good hotel. Rooms slightly dated,Rooms were good but slightly dated. Staff were very friendly and accommodating. I would return and recommend the hotel. Easy to get a bus to and from airport and then into dublin. The Park was also nice. ,4,2017,08,29
213,We will be back,"Nice hotel located near a fantastic park ideal to go with children. 
Maybe a bit far of the center but the place is very quiet.
Exquisite treatment of hotel staff.
The Nespresso in the room is a great idea.
Thanks for all. 
King regards.
",5,2017,08,29
213,Quiet & Efficient,"I highly recommend Herbert Park Hotel for its pleasant calm environment near an urban park & housing complex just a short bus ride away from the noisy city centre. We stayed one night at there in Dublin after 3 days & nights travelling in the stunning west coast of Ireland. Herbert's staff are very efficient and the underground parking is a great advantage over other hotels of the same category. I will definitely stay there again on future trips to Dublin.

213,Family holiday,Fantastic stay for us with our small baby. Location is perfect...within a stone's throw of Ballsbridge main thoroughfare. The staff were very friendly and most helpful and the room was a great size and decorated to a high standard. It is slightly on the expensive side however. Would definitely stay again. ,5,2017,08,29
213,Fantastic Stay in Ballsbridge,"Thank you so much for such an AMAZING stay on my first trip to Ireland - it was a pleasure calling the Herbert Park Hotel my ""home away from home.""  From the courteous staff, to the spacious room, to the fabulous breakfast spread - there wasn't an element of hospitality that didn't go untouched!

I want to give special thank yous & my appreciation to Gerad (who is a world of knowledge and really assisted with guiding us around to some of the local areas), Arijan, Lara (she's the leader of the pack - always superior service with a smile), Dominic, Davide, Julie, & Siva (who greeted us for breakfast each morning in the restaurant when we arrived).

Thank you all again for everything you have done during our stay - we will most definitely be staying with you the next time we come back to Dublin!   ",5,2017,08,29
213,Terrific Hotel,We stay here four or five times a year on average. It is located in a beautiful part of Dublin and within a five to seven minute taxi ride from Grafton St. Luxury at affordable prices. Staff are extremely helpful...just ask and it will arrive!! There is a lovely welcoming and relaxing atmosphere throughout.,5,2017,08,28
213,"Lovely venue for morning coffee, lunch or whatever.","I was invited here last week by a colleague for a simple morning coffee and I have to say that I was really very impressed. The lounge area was large but not cold or impersonal. The staff were warm and friendly and the whole operation exuded class. I asked for a cappuccino. This was no bang-the-cup-on-a table affair but was elegantly presented on a small oblong silver tray with a small glass of water and some chocolate squares, all of excellent quality. Very imaginative catering practice I have to say. I will be back sometime soon.....",5,2017,08,28
213,Great Hotel,"I have stayed here several times. I love this hotel! Rooms, staff and food are all excellent for a very fair price.  Great location on Herbert Park. Would highly recommend this place for business or pleasure.",5,2017,08,28

213,RDS Horse Show,"We stayed here again this year for the RDS Horse Show and we were not disappointed. It was lovely to be welcomed back with a shot of whiskey and a horse show cupcake. It's the small things that make the difference. The hotel was obviously super busy, but also super clean. Our room was fabulous and spacious. The food and drink couldn't have been better. Looking forward to next year already.",5,2017,08,27

213,Another great weekend!,"As always, my wife and I enjoyed our stay at the Herbert Park hotel - it's where we always stay when visiting Dublin. The location is superb - adjacent to the park, short walk to Aviva, RDS, Dart station, ample choice of good restaurants nearby) All rooms have a modern but cosy feel, and are always immaculate on arrival. The lounge area is a great place to relax in the evening, and the staff  make you feel that you are part of the family!  ",5,2017,08,23
213,Beautiful hotel in beautiful location,"I booked this hotel for a last minute business trip. Delighted with my choice. Friendly and helpful staff. Clean spacious and modern room.
Relaxing environment, beautiful location (right beside Herbert Park)",5,2017,08,23
213,Nice hotel,"Very nice clean hotel.  However everyone had a nescafe coffee machine in their rooms and since I had a single room I did not get one. I was only given a hot water pot with instant coffee.  Kinda disappointing but nothing major, I still had a wonderful stay at a great location. ",4,2017,08,23
213,Better than most hotels in Dublin!,Give this hotel a try. Wonderful food and service and 10 mins from city centre by taxi. Book the best room you can afford and include breakfast as it's one of the best I've had ! Service was perfect and discrete. ,5,2017,08,23
213,Lovely Staff,"I booked my reservation through Authentic Ireland travel from the U.S and the stay at the Herbert Park Hotel was wonderful once I figured out that I needed to use the room key card to operate the lights ;-). I am just leaving Dublin today, after being in the country for a 10 day 'holiday' and will definitely leave having fond memories of this hotel.

When I arrived on 8/14/17, the staff greeted me very friendly and helped explain how to get around. When my phone charger (i bought the US/Ireland adapter)  wasn't charging, someone at the front desk at 3am offered aid in helping me sort out the issue. I travelled solo and with a bit of anxiety as it was my first time leaving the country as well as suffering from anxiety in itself. The staff helped me through all my mishaps in Dublin and were so comforting. When I arrived, my phone wouldn't receive service. I couldn't text, message, access the internet, or call. Which led to me not even being able to navigate the streets well without my phone in access. My adapter would't work, and through the entire time, the staff was extremely comforting, even offering to come up to my room or help make phone calls to sort out the issue with my phone. 

Verizon from the US assured me that my phone would work over here but when I arrived in Dublin it did not at all.  I wasn't able to connect to Verizon support and the Verizon number for Ireland wasn't working. The staff were very accommodating, helpful, and comforting. They helped me navigate to find another phone store to purchase an Irish SIM card and took the time to explain the directions very clearly for me so I could find the location and see about sorting out the problem. I ended up buying an adapter from the front desk which was helpful to have two-one for charger and one for flat iron through the process. Their adapter worked in every place I stayed. I also ended up getting an Irish SIM card from Meteor, a store on Grafton St. which they suggested. The trip would have felt ruined if it weren't for the gracious staff in the hotel of Herbert Park. I owe the staff a tremendous bit of gratitude and will always remember their wonderful hospitality. Ioda or Iona and Robert I believe were the two that really assisted me. I appologize if I butcheredt heir names. I was trying to recall their names. Ioda (Iona?) also assisted me on getting a taxi and showing me Here, another wonderful app for getting around as Google Maps was a bit tricky when walking around (I finally had service after getting the SIM card). 

Please consider booking through this hotel. They truly saved my trip and the hospitality alone is worth the journey here. 

P.S The breakfast buffet was lovely. 

THANK YOU AGAIN FOR HELPING THIS HELPLESS, VERY OVERWHELMED AMERICAN.",5,2017,08,23
213,Ms Tam Condon,"Visiting Dublin with my partner each year we have decided to only stay at this establishment. The staff, management, rooms, restaurant & every aspect of this hotel are second to none. Heading back in December this year, we are booking our stay in advance.",5,2017,08,23
213,One night stay,Had a lovely one night stay at the Herbert Park. The room was amazing as we were upgraded to a suite. Love it staff...great atmosphere...beautiful hotel and the location is great also. Didn't have breakfast but will do the next time.,5,2017,08,22
213,Our stay at Herbert Park,Booked Herbert Park from Australia. We were not familiar with the Ballsbridge area but found that the Herbert Park was in a convenient location for buses into central Dublin. Loved our stay and found the staff to be most helpful. Would recommend the Herbert Park. ,4,2017,08,21
213,Brilliant,"had a brilliant stay, staff are very helpful and friendly, the room was very spacious, bright, clean and finished  to a high standard, we stay in a double room a king size bed which was super comfy and we dine in the restaurant which has some fine food, overall really enjoyed our stay at the Herbert Park Hotel  ",5,2017,08,21
213,First Visit To Herbert Park,"Have just returned from a one night stay in the Herbert Park Hotel. The bedrooms are large, modern and well-appointed, however, we found the bed and pillows to be very hard and did not get a good night's sleep. We joined relatives for Dinner and had booked a table for 6 people in the hotel restaurant  on the evening of our arrival. The meal was excellent, the service faultless, the food and presentation of the highest quality and it seemed a shame that the restaurant was virtually empty on a Saturday evening.  Breakfast the following morning was fine, however, I do think that a 4* hotel should not require its guests to stand in a queue to operate a toaster and then charge 16 Euros per person for continental breakfast which should have been included as part of the overnight package. That said this hotel offers spacious modern facilities, very friendly and helpful staff and we would return especially if they invested in softer mattress and pillows.

213,Lovely stay! ,"We stayed here for the Bank Holiday weekend. 
Staff very friendly and accommodating. 
Our room was clean & spacious. 
We had prosecco & canapés included which were lovely. 
Breakfast the next morning was a buffet of cereals, fresh fruits, yogurt and also a cooked breakfast too. 

The hotel is in an ideal location for those who may be going to a rugby game at the near by RDS or the Aviva Stadium. 

It is a 2 minute walk to the The Bridge 1859  (pub).",5,2017,08,19
213,Welcoming and good location,"Exceptionally warm and friendly staff, couldn't do enough for us. Excellent location, right in the heart of Ballsbridge, very near some fabulous bars and restaurants and only a short distance (via bus or taxi) from the city centre. Nice location, very safe area of Dublin and a stones throw from the Aviva Staduim and the RDS, very handy if an event is on. Only downsides were minor such as coffee machine not working (very coffee dependant!) and stained carpet. Also woken early by construction work that hadn't been warned about, which could have been easily avoided. On saying that, the rooms are big and spacious and beds are exceptionally comfortable and the bar and Terrace food is delicious and reasonably priced. ",4,2017,08,18
213,Nice hotel but awful beds...,"The hotel location was good and although a bit out of the city center it's only a 30 min walk. Hotel ameneties are heavily over prices (food, mini bar, drinks etc.) Rooms were nice and the daily cleaning staff did a very good job however the beds and pillows were very hard and not comfortable at all - all in all 3 sleepless nights..",3,2017,08,18
213,Efficient & Friendly,"Stayed at the Herbert Park Hotel Dublin for three nights at the end of our two week self drive holiday of Ireland. It is a nice hotel with efficient and friendly staff. Our room was well appointed with a nice sized bathroom containing vanity, toilet and combination bath with shower head and curtain. To large singles combined to make up the king bed. A small table and two occasional chairs plus a desk area with additional chair completed the furnishings. Room contained a nespresso machine with a variety of coffee pods and tea bags. There is currently a building project underway (August 2017) immediately next door so the day time construction noise is pretty constant. Breakfast selection was very good and we also purchased a snack meal in the open cafe area one evening. Location is about a 45 minute walk from the main city centre which suited us but could be a bit too far for some.",4,2017,08,17
213,excellent hotel to stay for a visit to Dublin,"Everything was perfect: nice room, friendly staff. Good breakfast.
The restaurant (i.e. not the lobby snack and bar) is truely outstanding!
We had three lovely dinners there, including a fabulous grilled lobster plate.",5,2017,08,17

Look forward to our next visit! ",5,2017,08,16
213,Business and leisure,"Lovely hotel and location ideal. Staff were more than helpful and very friendly. I did book a sinle room but was surprised how small it was! Was a little disappointed by food with selection of sea food and vegetarian dishes.
I would have enjoyed reading the paper when having breakfast as most hotels have one complimentary at reception. All in all a lovely visit.",4,2017,08,16
213,Our stay,"Fabulous decor and surroundings - Friendly staff both inside and outside staff - Brilliant on the security end felt safe - Excellent Breakfast & food.
After the hustle & bustle coming back to the Herbert Park Hotel was so calming and relaxing.
We have never been disappointed over the last 4-5 years.",5,2017,08,16
213,Dublin horse show week,Excellent clean and friendly hotel let down by the breakfast. The toaster was smoking and either dod not cook or burmt the toast. Food was cool and the bacon and eggs were underdone. Such a shame for such a beautiful hotel,3,2017,08,16
213,Horse show,Stayed hete for dublin horse show. Perfect location for it. Very friendly staff in hotel reception and bar area. Food was amaxing in bar and best breakfast ever. Rooms very comfy. Will definately stay again.,5,2017,08,16
213,Nice hotel - good location.,We stayed for one night in Aug - good rate as it was a Sunday evening. Nice atmosphere in the hotel and all staff we came across were pleasant. We had room only so cannot comment on food. Drinks in the bar expensive but this was in line with any other 4* Dublin hotel prices. ,4,2017,08,16
213,Relaxing venue,"Home from home. 
Staff very pleasant. I remember them from year to year and vice versa. Quietness of lounge is appealing for relaxation. Location close to park ideal for a fresh air wander before a relaxing cocktail. ",5,2017,08,14
213,Dublin horse show,Very clean friendly hotel ideally situated for the horse show. Our room had a large generator outside our window which kept us awake for 2 night until the hotel moved us to another room. I felt that we should have been offered a meal even a bottle of wine as a good will gesture as we have been staying at this hotel for severely years for the horse show.,5,2017,08,14
213,Beautiful Hotel,"Best Irish Coffee in Dublin, thanks Jan! The lobby staff were attentive and kind. Overall, staff and hotel was lovely! The hotel located next to the park was beautiful. We were well taken care of and the room was very comfortable. ",4,2017,08,14
213,very friendly staff in an excellent location,"very friendly staff, great location with very good restaurants and pubs nearby, just a short taxi ride for the city but far enough away to have the quietness and comfort, never think you in a city when you stay here, bus 200 metres down the road and taxis outside the door, perfect ",5,2017,08,14
213,Excellent,Stayed at the Herbert Park Hotel this year for the Dublin Horse Show.  It was my first time staying here and I really enjoyed my stay.  The breakfast every morning was excellent with a fabulous array to choose from.  I would have no problem in recommending this Hotel to friends or family and plan to rebook for next year again!,5,2017,08,14
213,Place to stay for RDS Horse Show,A wonderful hotel adjacent to the RDS horse show.  Food is great and reasonably priced in the very relaxing bar.  Staff very friendly.   I have stayed at this hotel 10 years and will continue to do so. If,5,2017,08,14
213,Excellent hotel,This hotel is perfect for Dublin Horse Show and any other event in Ballsbridge. The staff are some of the best anywhere! It is spacious and comfortably contemporary rather than austere. The rooms are well appointed but the beds could be softer. We enjoyed our stay as always. ,4,2017,08,14
213,Irish weekend,"Big hotel but lacks character. Its good, has good facilities, better for business trips really. Its a taxi ride to anywhere, but this isn't really a problem and fairly inexpensive, Quiet hotel, decent sound-proofing, overlooks park (if lucky) or river, which is being ""refurbished"".... and the builders start early (July 2017)... close to AVIVA stadium (short walk). comfortable, Nespresso coffee machines in rooms. Good sized rooms. Cannot really fault it - except a bit pricey, so has breakfast around the corner which was very good value. The staff were all very helpful and friendly... in fact we found everyone in Dublin to be friendly and helpful.... we were lucky enough to have very good weather,",4,2017,08,13
213,Our stay at The Herbert Park Hotel,"From the moment the door was opened for us at this beautiful hotel we had a great time, our room was kept immaculate every day and bottled water supplied every day..The staff in the bar and restaurant where courteous and helpful.. we where early risers as we where staying because of the Horse Show, so was able to talk to some cleaners again the staff where courteous and a credit to the hotel.. The front of house staff where very polite and informative, making sure we had everything we needed. When booking in we where given cupcakes and a small shot of Bailey's, such a nice gesture I thought... The concierge was very helpful and knowledgeable... Overall the perfect Hotel...You most certainly get what you pay for here... We have stayed here a few times before and most definitely will be back. Obviously we have a manager here at this hotel who certainly keeps his/her finger on the pulse with an excellent team of people behind him/her.....What I must say also is all the staff here have a lovely smile on their face, which says a lot... Keep up the good work and service...",5,2017,08,13
213,Dublin show,We enjoy staying at the Herbert Park but we only want 2 nights which from 2018 will no longer be offered  so will not be able  to stay there next year  as there is a minimum of 3 nights. Shame but we will not book again.,4,2017,08,12
213,Highly recommend,"Just had 2 nights in this lovely hotel for the RDS show. Hotel was spotless, service was excellent. The food was good and the staff could not have been any more helpful and friendly. The only slight down is the fact you get charged for parking your car.......as a resident I don't think car parking charges should apply. That was the only flaw in an otherwise perfect stay.",5,2017,08,12
213,My stay,"I would thoroughly recommend this hotel - the staff were exceptionally pleasant and helpful.  Choice of food was excellent, service was quick and food was piping hot.  The only downside was that I felt the car parking charges were much too high for residents.",5,2017,08,12
213,Location for aviva,"Stayed here for the Liverpool football match in the aviva.Great experience great location room clean and tidy, great shower and lovely breakfast.Had late dinner in the bar area lovely fish and chips and seafood chowder and wheaten bread all in all good stay.",4,2017,08,11
213,Afternoon tea.,"This hotel is situated to Herbert Park.   This park is pleasant to walk around with a lake and plenty of room to play in.   We visited the hotel for afternoon tea.   The tea itself was enjoyable and reasonably priced but the disappointment came when we left.   We had to pay for our car parking - a hefty EUR3 per hour, or part thereof.   That means that a leisurely afternoon tea is going to cost EUR6 in car parking.",3,2017,08,11
213,A great find.,"This is a gem of a hotel near the American embassy. It is quiet, unpretentious, clean, crisp, and effortless. Everything is ergonomicically friendly. Great oasis in a bustling metropolis. The nearby bistro Roly's was superb for any meal. We ate four meals there.",5,2017,08,11
213,My Review,Everything was perfect. We enjoyed the friendly reception of cake and welcoming drink. All the staff were very friendly and helpful. We will definitely be back. We have no complaints. keep up the good work.,5,2017,08,11
213,Mostly good!,"We stayed here on Monday. Check in was friendly and professional, and our executive room was clean, bright, spacious and super comfortable.

We were heading on to Galway the next day so we didn't want to venture far and decided on drinks at the hotel bar. There was a nice selection of beer, however cocktails are seriously overpriced for the standard they come. I ordered a raspberry mojito was was nearly €14 with barely any raspberry muddled through it and just tasted of rum and soda. You can get drinks far better and much cheaper in the city. 

We also realised there was no music playing, which made for a really strange atmosphere as there wasn't many people in the lounge so we could all hear each other's conversations.

The decision was head to head over to The Bridge bar across the road and it was great. Good drinks and good fun :)

Came back and we ordered a room service beef lasagne which was served really hot and tasted great. The night porter was really helpful that night.

Although the Herbert served its purpose for us as a stop off point. I wouldn't really recommend it to couples. Although I would to families and business user. ",4,2017,08,11
213,First class hotel,First class experience each year when we visit - location is fantastic for rds and there is always a very pleasing atmosphere about it whilst being treated like we are 'special guests' of the hotel! Food is excellent as well and staff so welcoming.,5,2017,08,11
213,Excellent location and service !,This hotel was perfect for our stay - 20 mins walk from the city centre and 10 mins from the Aviva stadium - it was also overlooking Herbert Park which was nice for a wander in the morning. The staff were all really friendly and helpful and the facilities immaculate - could not fault it at all and we will be back !!,5,2017,08,10
213,Great place,"The facility was lovely and the staff were very friendly and helpful. It was also in a very nice part of town, not downtown but on the outskirts in a safe neighborhood. I would definitely stay here again if given the opportunity. ",5,2017,08,10
213,A fab stay!,"We had a great stay here from the moment we checked in until checkout. The reception staff were so friendly and literally couldn't do enough for us. We were early for check in but they still found us a room despite ours not being ready. It was no problem to order taxis or store our bags after departure... nothing was a bother! Breakfast was fab with a great variety of buffett and cooked to order breakfasts! Breakfast was served with a great view of Herbert park... very scenic. Beds were really comfortable and the rooms had everything you would need. The hotel is in a great location... only minutes walk from Aviva and a 5 minute drive to city centre. There are plenty of restaurants and pubs nearby, yet it is a quieter area. Couldn't fault anything about it and will definitely be back in the  future!",5,2017,08,10
213,"Location, Rooms & Staff all 5 star","Excellent hotel - location, staff and rooms all top class- a little pricey but that's Dublin! Would recommend this hotel and will be back again! Staff extremely helpful & friendly - check in & check out was seamless. Room was modern and clean. ",5,2017,08,10
213,Very welcoming and friendly hotel in a fantastic location ,"We stayed just one night, Tues 8th Aug, and despite a very busy hotel for the Horse Shoe next door, all of the staff were incredibly welcoming and friendly. My husband and 5 year old daughter had a wonderful breakfast and were looked after very well. Then Lara and Egle at the front desk made our day with wonderful homemade cupcakes! I can certainly recommend how close it is to both Ballsbridge pubs (1 min) and the City (we walked in 20mins). Great visit.",5,2017,08,10
213,Fabulous,"Just spent 3 nights at this wonderful hotel and had 2 adjoining rooms for 3 adults and a child.  It's leaning more towards a 5* in my opinion.  Great location with easy bus service to City. The hotel is beautifully bright and spacious as you enter, and overlooks a lovely terrace.  The attention to detail was superb, beds were just so comfortable, 6ft bed in one room and 2 decent single beds in the other room. The staff were fantastic, service excellent, great breakfast with fabulous variety of fruit, cheeses and everything you could want.  We ate lunch and had dinner on 2 evenings, the food was wonderful.  Really great stay and would be delighted to return.  I recommend this hotel highly.",5,2017,08,09
213,Great Hotel and very comfortable stay,"We stayed in the hotel for just the one night.
The hotel is well situated close to the city centre. 
We stay in the Standard King room which is was a decent size with a large bed and over all very comfortable.
The staff were very friendly and efficient. Check in and Check out were very quick.
Over all we enjoyed our stay and would not hesitate to book again.",5,2017,08,09
213,Excellent room but poor greeting,"Everything was perfect except one tiny thing! On arrival the woman checking us in could hardly crack a smile and was not polite or cheerful talking to us, it put a downer on the buzz of finally arriving!
There was no 'How are you all' or 'How was your trip here?', I've stayed in 2 star hotels who ask these questions with a smile, they really go a long way to making you feel welcome at the hotel.
However, I have to compliment the bar staff, they couldn't have been more helpful and nicer. They're the reason this review is 5 stars!

213,Superb service,"We arrived and needed a quick check in as we were running late for a wedding, the person behind the check in desk was the most efficient I've ever seen!

All in all an excellent stay and one that will be repeated .",5,2017,08,08

I would stay here again. ",5,2017,08,07
213,Modern friendly hotel with great service ,"I was in Dublin for almost a month for business and decided to stay at the Herbert because of it's convenient location. To be honest at first I was a bit concerned before arriving because some of the reviews were mediocre.   But I have to say I truly enjoyed my stay, it's a great hotel especially for a long stay.  When you spend this much time at a hotel you really get to know what they do well and what can be improved.  First the many positives about this hotel:
-excellent and friendly service. This hotel's service staff to include those at check in and the restaurant were simply outstanding. Helpful and knowledgeable about the city and sites to see.
- excellent location far from the maddening crowds.  A bit out of the crowded parts of the city but only a 20-25 minute walk to all the main tourist spots. Also adjacent to a beautiful park.
- convenient informal lobby dining, set up with comfy sofas and chairs, perfect for the business traveler dining alone or with colleagues.
-modern and spotless dining areas and room
-excellent restaurants all within a five minutes walk

Now for some areas for improvement and there were only a few that I saw:
- a makeup mirror in the bathroom 
-a little more variety for the hot breakfast, while there was always plenty of food I would suggest switching out the McDonald's style potatoes for real home fries
-more guest umbrellas.

The bottom line I would highly recommend this hotel, the employees take pride in this hotel and it shows!

213,Excellent experience,"Polished, professional, clean, and good customer service.  I highly recommend a stay here if one is in Dublin on business.  The location was a little far from the tourist locations,  The breakfast buffet was excellent.  The meeting rooms were a bit small for our group of 40.  ",5,2017,08,07
213,Trip to Dublin,Lovely Hotel and very helpful staff. We enjoyed our stay very much. the views over the  park are beautiful and it is lovely to walk around. We will definitely stay at the Herbert Park Hotel again when we visit Dublin on our next trip.,5,2017,08,07
213,Short Stay,"Ideal location, close to parks, excellent restaurants and a 30 minute walk to Grafton St.
A real find, superb rooms, professional staff, my only gripe that because of the BH w/e is was a little pricey.",5,2017,08,07
213,Another Greta Stay," have been staying at the HP for 15 years or more . It is the best Hotel I have stayed in Dublin . Service , Quality of food never changes . First Class all the time .
I would have no hesitation in recommending the Herbert Park for a stay in Dublin 

",5,2017,08,07
213,Really nice hotel ,"Staying in this hotel for 2 nights,we were attending a match in The Aviva. Location is perfect for the stadium.
Staff were very friendly & helpful.
On our first night we did get woke by the fire alarm.
Rooms are extremely comfortable,other than the fire alarm we all slept great.
Didn't have any meals in the hotel so I can't comment on the food.
Lovely park nearby to go for a stroll.",5,2017,08,06
213,Average 4 start hotel,"The hotel included what you expect from a 4 star hotel. Nevertheless, the hair dryer could be improved significantly. Also, construction works nearby limited the view and created noise. Breakfast was very basic. ",3,2017,08,06
213,Herbert park,"The Herbert park hotel is a beautiful and relaxing hotel just outside the heart of Dublin City
It has very professional staff both front of house and behind the scenes 
The only grievance I would have is the cleaning staff came in to our room at 8:50 while myself and partner were asleep this took us by shock as we were away for a couples night. ",4,2017,08,06
213,Poor service in breakfast room - 2* Quality Breakfast,"Service on breakfast room is totally non existent despite there being numerous young inexperienced servers and a manager on the entrance to restaurant. On both mornings of our stay Breakfast was poor - fruit bowl was empty, milk container for cereals was empty and there was no bread out for toast.",3,2017,08,06
213,"Welcoming Hotel, lovely stay","We had a lovely time staying at this hotel. The staff were wonderful, very attentive and helpful. The hotel itself was well equipped -We particularly liked the coffee machine in Our room! -And clean and tidy throughout.",5,2017,08,06
213,Great experience,Great hotel great staff great experience. The breakfast included many options. I didnt eat lunch and dinner at the hotel so i cabt review the meals. The staff was friendly and helpful and it's the most important for me. I truly suggest the hotel to everyone !!,5,2017,08,06
213,Very good,"Nothing to say in particular apart from the fact that I spent 3 great nights at the hotel. The staff was professionnal, friendly and available for any enquiry, the bedroom was perfectly clean and comfortable.",4,2017,08,05
213,Wife's 50th,"Travelled to Dublin for my wife's 50th birthday so wanted to stay somewhere special to treat her , I chose the Herbert park hotel as it's views and rooms looked fantastic, how wrong I was ! 
The room we were given was lovely it was very clean then I looked out the window at a massive crane and a huge building site , the Monday morning was a great wake up call at 7.30 with the noise of drills and heavy plant machinery ,on trying to leave the hotel there was a power cut so with cases me and my wife had to track down 4 floors of stairs 9 flights in total , then we couldn't check out properly as there was no power , I paid everything cash on this trip so I didn't get no surprises on my card , got nothing on my card or from the mini bar ,
But the next day when back in the U.K. I checked my bank and the hotel had taken €31.55 from my account for mini bar items ???? I've rang the hotel and complained still waiting for a refund . Don't think the Herbert park will be getting a 2nd visit from me for one they had my contact details why didn't they ring me to say they were going 
to charge my card and to clarify that me or my wife hadn't used 
the mini bar , do not like things being charged from my bank without my permission for something I've never had isn't this fraud ? ",3,2017,08,05
213,Happy trip,"Visited this hotel on a work trip I would definitely go again. Food was devine, had bed breakfast and evening meal, drinks on the pricey side, service extremely good. Only downside for me is that as I was in a single room so had no coffee or tea making facilities as the room was to small, they did state that I could ring reception and they would send a pot of tea/coffee to my room, I did not take them up on this but did miss not being able to make some whenever I wanted. Would I stay again a resounding yes, in fact I am in discussions with my husband about a trip for the two of us and if I can find a deal then we will stay at this hotel",4,2017,08,05
213,Very Good Experience!,"Modern hotel with comforts, facilities, very good restaurant & very good breakfast. Good location  not far from the city centre, close to Lansdowne Road Aviva Stadium. Very kind and helpful staff. Next to the Hotel there's the lovely Herbert Park.",4,2017,08,04
213,Stay at Herbert Park July 2017,I cannot recommend this hotel highly enough.  Everything was outstanding.  Staff very friendly and attentive and couldnt do enough for us. Good location in a nice area.  Rooms fantastic and really clean.  Can't fault a single thing.  The park is only a stroll out of the door and is lovely for an early morning walk.,5,2017,08,03
213,First of two reviews...,"We have not even stayed yet in the Herbert Park Hotel and I must give a thumbs up for the reservation staff, especially Karen.  My hubs proposed to me in Herbert Park in 1978 when we were just 21 years old. We met when I was 15 and he was 16, Herbert Park was our 'courting' park.  So to stay in Herbert Park hotel for a couple of nights 39 years ago, 4 kids and 2 baby grandchildren later means so much to us. I rang just now to reservations (Karen) and I was complicating the booking with special requests, she was so kind and understanding.  She rang me back a short while ago with everything in place.  That is good service but more importantly, I had a slight problem and she gave me the solution.  That is the ethos of customer relations, excellent service.  I will have my second review after the weekend, having actually stayed and hopefully enjoyed the food.  #Romancestillalive",5,2017,08,03
213,Excellent hotel,"We stayed at Herbert Park Hotel for three nights at the end of our tour in Ireland. We enjoyed the stay. You can walk to the center of Dublin, or you can take a bus, which stops nearby. The staff was very friendly and helpful.",5,2017,08,03
213,My stay,I so enjoyed my stay. The room was clean and had all that things that I needed. The breakfast was excellent and I so please to have a continental breakfast available on the day I needed to leave early. The bar had excellent food and wine was superior. ,5,2017,08,02

213,Pleasant stay,"Very friendly staff.  Clean room.  Very comfortable bed and I loved the complimentary coffee and tea in room.  The location is about a mile and a half from the centra, city which was about a 25-30 minute walk each way.  ",4,2017,07,31
213,a few days in Dublin near the beautiful park,"I spent a few days here visiting family. The hotel is beside a wonderful park so its like being in the countryside, even though you are really close to the centre of Dublin. The food is delicious and the staff are very nice and helpful. The rooms are spotlessly clean.",5,2017,07,31
213,Business Meeting including overnight,"We recently used the Herbert Park Hotel for a business meeting which also included an overnight stay.  The meeting room facilities are excellent, the staff were very professional and helpful.

213,Good overall experience,"Everything was great. The only issue I had was when I called to the restaurant, I asked what was gluten free on the menu and he had a bit of trouble telling me. When I asked a few specific things, I feel he got a bit annoyed and said ""look just tell me what you want and I'll let you know if it's gluten free"" with attitude. I wasn't prepared to order right at that moment and I felt that reaction was a little bit rude. ",4,2017,07,28
213,Great stay,"This hotel is ideally located, just outside the city centre. The food is wonderful and atmosphere is always in the lounge area is exciting, always such a buzz around. The staff are so friendly and so helpful. 
Will for sure be back. ",5,2017,07,26
213,Amazing,"Great Hotel.  So when we booked U2 was in town.  Hotel prices were outrageous in the middle of the city and after some research Ballsbridge area kept popping up.

When we go back to Dublin this will be our go too!",5,2017,07,26
213,Just the right place! ,"We recently stayed at the Herbert Park Hotel for vacation. The hotel is lovely, modern, very clean, and easily found. By far, the best thing about this place is the staff. They were unbelievably attentive and accommodating. We did not sleep on our over night flight and they immediately got our rooms ready early so we could nap. The concierge service at the front desk helped our group with all of our tourist needs and sent us off with a wave and a smile! The morning breakfast was a lovely mix of fresh food with fruit and hot dishes to take care of every preference. The honey was particularly great. The hotel is on a park and it is just perfect for a quick walk to cure the jet lag. We can't wait to go back! ",4,2017,07,26
213,amazing staff,"we picked this hotel for both its price and location. we were glad also that it was really good.
all of staff are amazing and helpful, clean property and also 35 mn walk from city center.
it had amazing coffee shops literally close to it (java cafe 3 mn walk and rolly's 2 mn walk), also nice restaurants like the girl and the goose (3 mn walk as well)

213,Almost perfect.,"Great location for Dublin and a fair price for a 4*. Let down by the wardrobes being too small for a seven night stay.

Highly recommend!",5,2017,07,24
213,Great staff ,"I've often stayed at this hotel and always found it exemplary. On this occasion, we merely called in for a drink , which is not really a reason for a review, however the service and cordiality was wonderful and thus warrants this review. In the past we have been extremely well attended to by Siva but his absence was more than made up for by Dharam and Brian. Again well done Herbert Park, great service as usual.",5,2017,07,24
213,Very comfortable and nice area,The hotel was very very nice. The personnel was very friendly and the room was cosy. The best thing is that the hotel is in a very nice area. Everything needed you can find in the room. The beds are extremely comfortable.,5,2017,07,24

213,Great hotell!,"We stayed here when we visit Dublin to watch U2. The hotel was very nice and the staff was very friendly and helpful. The breakfast was excellent. I would not have any problems with booking another stay at Herbert Park Hotel. Also there are nice pubs and small restaurants near by, perfect for a cold ale before bedtime.",5,2017,07,24
213,Overpriced,"Stayed at the hotel in the past and always thought it was excellent and well priced.
Just returned from a weekend and really feel annoyed that we had to pay well over the average prices because of the U2 concert and hotels charging increases rates.",3,2017,07,24
213,The best hotel in Dublin,"This is the best hotel by far that we stayed in. The hotel restaurant was amazing!! I had the best steak and French Onion soup of my life. The breakfast was wonderful and they had the best white pudding that we have experienced. 
The rooms were clean and the staff was friendly. We had a five star experience. ",5,2017,07,24
213,Suzanne,"A wonderful clean hotel with a park located outside the hotel.  The amenities were very good.  Breakfast was at a cost, but well worth the fees.  The hotel staff was wonderful, especially during breakfast.  The hotel has lots of little cafe shops within walking distance.  The hotel is located a distance away from the general bus pick up area.  Taxi's are available with very cordial drivers eager to know where you come from.  Very safe neighborhood.  I recommend this property with an excellent rating!! ",5,2017,07,23
213,Vacation,"This is a delightful Hotel in Dublin.  We enjoyed all the nearby Pubs and parks.  The Hotel is comfortable, very clean and the staff goes out of their way to help in any way.  Herbert Park is right out the door and a great place to walk.  ",5,2017,07,23

The hotel is adjoining a huge public park that we enjoyed walking in the morning and late afternoon.
All staff are genuinely friendly and helpful from front desk to the house keeping team. 
The hotel is on direct route to most of the places and it wouldn’t need more than one change to go to any other place in Dublin.
Good and reasonably-priced Restaurants, coffee shops and groceries are within stone throw away from the hotel. 
Nespresso coffee machine in the room with varieties of coffee or tea, much better than the kettle. 
Family-friendly and optimally located",5,2017,07,22

213,A very pleasant hotel,"I only stayed here for one night but found the hotel to be extremely comfortable. Huge rooms, friendly staff and good value for money. I would recommend thesis a base for exploring Dublin. I suppose it helped that one of my favourite restaurants was right around the corner!",5,2017,07,20
213,Mixed feelings,"After a very long day of travel from the states we arrived at Herbert Park at 11:30pm so ready for a shower and a good night sleep. I booked us a room over a month prior with special notations of late arrival. When we went to check in we were told that they sold our room!!! Subsequently we were being ""walked"" to another hotel! That meant waiting for a cab and being transferred to a downtown hotel...another hour at least.
I must say that the desk and hotel staff did everything they could to make us happy. They opened the kitchen and cooked us a complimentary  dinner while we waited and 
were extremely attentive. We returned the next day to check into our room at the Herbert Park and meet family; we were met with a bottle of champagne and a platter of delicious pastries and treats. The staff did exactly what they needed to do to turn a disaster into a pleasant stay. Cudos to the staff and their hospitality!",4,2017,07,19
213,CIE Irish Odyssey,"Wonderful check in experience and customer service!  Great location, excellent accommodations and services.  Loved the Irish Whisky and Bailey's offering at check-in for ""the parents!""  Food was excellent",5,2017,07,19
213,sleep,"the building site kicked off quite early just below my room, i appreciate in a city centre hotel, residual noise is always going to be an issue, but i think being woken at 06:55 is asking a little too much. Apart from that, great location, staff and facilities all excellent. ",5,2017,07,19
213,Weekend stay,"Have stayed at your hotel many times. It's very clean, friendly and location is not too far out of Dublin centre. The food also I would highly recommend in bar and restaurant. Overall our experience has never been disappointing ",5,2017,07,18

213,Lovely friendly hotel stay,"We had a wonderful stay at the Herbert Park, with its main drawback (for me) being its location - although it is a walkable distance away, it's probably about 30 minutes from Grafton Street. Otherwise the room was clean and the staff were incredibly friendly and helpful, especially Lara at reception. ",4,2017,07,18
213,Wonderful time,The facilities were excellent and the staff was friendly and efficient. We felt welcomed from the time we arrived until we checked out.The location was convenient for touring the city as we began our tour of Ireland.,5,2017,07,18

213,Too expansive for no service,Standard Quality Hotel for 235EUR .... What is the reason to offer a standard business Hotel for a price of a lux hotel. If I want to sleep and to eat a Hamburger and drink a beer I do not want to pay such kind of high price. ,1,2017,07,17
213,One Star Too Many,"I travel a lot and stay in a lot of hotels that carry 4 stars. Unfortunately, in my opinion, Herbert Park is 3 at most. When I moved into my room- there was silicone falling off in pieces above the mirror in the bathroom, the wooden panel that covered the bottom of the tub was splitting and paint was chipping, the pillows smelled, in one of the hallways the wall phone was hanging by the wires, etc. I was moved immediately to a different room- which was little better, but still faced the same issues. 

I do have to give some credit to the staff, however- everyone was friendly and the cleaning staff was superb. 

All rooms need a face lift, or a star needs to go. ",2,2017,07,17
213,"Clean, quiet jotwl","We stayed at this hotel on the advise of a friend who lives in Dublin. We found it clean, quiet and upscale. The rooms were large and the housekeeping services were excellent. We had one snack/drink/dessert in the bar and the service was extremely slow but perhaps it was just an off night. Front desk staff was helpful. This hotel is a bit of a walk/cab ride from some of the Dublin action but if you are looking for cleanliness and space, this is a great option. There are fun restaurants and bars nearby and a wonderful park. ",4,2017,07,16
213,Lovely Hotel,"A beautiful, very comfortable hotel very nicely located in Dublin. Easy walking to restaurants, shops, bus stops, etc.  The food was excellent, especially loved the breakfast buffet each morning.  Staff was friendly and very helpful.",5,2017,07,16
213,"Excellent location, excellent hotel","Everyone very helpful, rooms clean and neat, couldn't be better.  Only minor thing was I thought breakfast at hotel a bit overpriced for what we wanted (a light breakfast).  There are several nearby options for this though if you want light breakfast.  Would definitely stay at Herbert Park again.",5,2017,07,16
213,Off Menu Veg food,"Being a vegetarian there were less choices. However, when I requested an Off menu vegetarian food, the Chef made me nice  vegetarian Fried rice.
The choices of breakfast are also very good.  Friendly staff at the front office and the restaurant. 
Ideal places for business travelers . Walkable to a variety of places. Nice park at the backyard. Free Highspeed Wifi keeps me well connnected.",5,2017,07,16
213,Excellent staff,"My husband and I are regular visitors to the Herbert Park hotel.I have reviewed the hotel positively on several occasions,based on location,value,comfort and friendly staff.....On this visit,I want to pay tribute to foyer bar/restaurant staff....Sameer and Dharam,who over many visits have proven to be at all times professional and courteous but also go that extra mile which is warm and friendly...couldn't praise the staff highly enough!!",5,2017,07,14
213,A fabulous place!,"Lovely room. Excellent location. Very friendly and efficient staff. Breakfast superb. Enjoyed having the
park land beside the hotel where we had a stroll after dinner.  One minor improvement might be to have digital TV in the room to give wider choice of TV channels.",5,2017,07,14
213,First Class,"Had the pleasure of staying in The Herbert Park this week, following my relocation to Dublin with work. I have to say it is a fantastic hotel, with lovely staff, food and the bedroom exceeded my expectations.  My stay in The Herbert Park made the move to Dublin easier, so thank you for that. ",5,2017,07,14
213,Excellent hotel in a brilliant location,"Having stayed here before on business it was a natural choice to stay here again. Breakfast offering is great, the rooms are lovely (I even received a free upgrade to an executive room overlooking Herbert Park). The staff are always happy to help and I can say with certainty that it makes for a great overall experience being in the Ballsbridge area with a good offering of bars and restaurants nearby.",5,2017,07,14

Also get the breakfast in the morning, everything is fresh and really good.",5,2017,07,13
213,July 2017,"Our family of 4 traveled for vacation from the States. Rooms were very good size for European hotel rooms, unfortunately we needed two rooms but this was not a large inconvenience as our children are 17 and 13. The staff was extremely helpful and made checking in and out very efficient. Car parking was very close. Only downside was the distance to downtown, 25-30 min walk to the nearest Hop-On/Hop Off Bus stop (we managed this several times but would have preferred to be a little closer). However, taxi service and local buses are very close. Hotel appears to be more intended as a business clientele vs families but was not a hindrance. We noticed that other tour companies were present during our stay. Overall experience was very good.",5,2017,07,13
213,Business Trip,"Perfect location, nice clean room, friendly efficient staff. Easy check in and check out, upon check in they took my bag to the room as I had a meeting to go to. Nice breakfast very accommodating ideal hotel for my needs    ",5,2017,07,13
213,Business trip,I had a wonderfull stay in the herbert park hotel for 2 weeks. Especially dharam and samer were the perfect hosts in the hotel bar were i enjoyed a drink every evening. They can make really nice cocktails ,5,2017,07,12

213,Food and service fantastic,"We had our tea this evening in the Terrace Lounge area of the Herbert Park and the food and the surroundings were beautiful! Two people had the tagliatelle, one had Caesar salad, one had soup and toasted sandwich and I had baked salmon with chive mash - everything was just gorgeous! Having said that, what made the evening even better was the service we received from Dharam! He was friendly, helpful and a joy to talk to! We always enjoy the food in the Herbert Park, but we will especially be looking forward to our next visit in the hopes of once again having the pleasure of meeting Him! Thank you Dharam, for making our visit so enjoyable!",5,2017,07,10
213,GOOD,"The Food was very continental and there was no attempt to provide Food to the largest population segment in the World Asia and China and the Middle East. The Kitchen was ill equipped for turning up even basic food say rice and lentils or curried veggies. The bangladeshi cook Paritosh served Thai condiments and passed it as Indian curry. Asians are big spenders so take care of them and the vegetarians. Second, kindly drop the Euro 6.50 service charge for sending anything to Rooms",4,2017,07,10
213,Lovely Stay,Herbert Park is a wonderful property that combines great service at reasonable prices in a fantastic location. We thoroughly enjoyed the friendly staff and their ability to accommodate our early arrival. ,4,2017,07,10
213,Nice Location,"While my room needed a bit of decor refrshening, the staff and property still provided a pleasant stay. My initial room was a bit too loud and a staff member seamlessly and kindly offered another room with less noise. Finally, the location offers a few eateries away from the hectic city center area which was quiet e joy.",4,2017,07,10
213,Solid Hotel,"This is a good hotel. Good parking, good rooms, good experience. The lobby is impressive, the hallways impressive and the rooms more than decent. There is no disappointment to be expected with this stainless steel hotel.",4,2017,07,10

213,Great hotel,"Recently went to a concert, 3 mile walking distance from Croke Park but next door to the Aviva.  Hotel was spotless and staff were very friendly.  Would need sat nav to find the hotel.  We never ate in the hotel but the bar looked lovely",5,2017,07,10
213,Great place,I loved everything about the hotel. Great place to stay. I did not know anything about Ireland or Dublin prior to the trip and the staff was very informative and helpful with all of my questions. If I return to Dublin I would stay in this hotel. ,5,2017,07,10
213,Peaceful night's sleep in lovely room interrupted by drilling from building site,"The room I stayed in a few days ago was really lovely but I was disappointed to be woken by the noise of drilling from a building site that my room was situated beside before 8 am.

What was more disappointing was the staff's reaction when I complained upon check-out. They showed absolutely no sympathy and said that I could have had my room changed if I had asked. How was I to know that I was going to be woken by drilling? It was dark when I checked in so I did not notice the building site. It also made me think as to why they put someone in a room beside a building site if there are other rooms available??",3,2017,07,09
213,Saturday night stay,"First time staying here, but know this hotel as a class establishment for years.
Staff were very friendly and helpful.
Service was very good.
Breakfast was good quality.
We stayed in 206/208. The rooms were a good size, air conditioned and very clean.
Shower was good.
A few extra toiletries would have been nice.
Towels a good quality.
A little out of city centre, but easy to get there.
I would stay again.",5,2017,07,09
213,Never be complacent,"No matter where you go, who you see, what you do or where you stay there is always room for improvement. Even excellent service can still go that one step forward, and then again usw. This hotel is no exception.",4,2017,07,08
213,Please wait till I Spend the night,Very helpful and knowledgeable staff. I will write my review after we spend the night. I have not spent the night yet so cannot write any more except to say that it has been pleasant during the few hours we've been in Dublin,5,2017,07,07
213,stay,"was only in the hotel for one night, which probably actually totalled only 8 hours! Short and sweet but served its purpose. Nice clean room and very comfortable bed. very helpful and friendly staff. had to leave early in the morning so was unable to sample the breakfast ",5,2017,07,07
213,Nice hotel in a calm area,"The room was spacious, clean and had a luxurious feel. I really appreciated that the room was air conditioned. Service was professional albeit a bit inpersonal. The hotel felt very 'business' and as more casual travelers we felt a bit out of place. We only stayed for one night, but overall it was a good experience. It's located outside the city centre and perhaps not ideal for a night on the town, but I can imagine it is excellent for business travelers.",4,2017,07,06
213,Perfect location in Dublin,"The room, the facilities, & the location are as always superb but above all the staff at the Herbert Park Hotel bring me back time after time. The location is perfect for my business trips being right in the heart of Ballsbridge, Dublin.",5,2017,07,06
213,What a great find!,"After trawling websites for a hotel that was still pretty central, offered quality but wasn't the cost of a hotel to the Maldives, we were so lucky to find this hotel. About a 40 minute walk from town and 30 from the beach, in a really beautiful part of Dublin, with great restaurants nearby, we loved everything about the hotel. The staff were all fantastic. Genuinely friendly but exceptionally professional as well. We were especially impressed with Dharam who really stood out looking after a busy bar but still providing us with perfect service and going out of his way to make our specially requested drinks. 
The bat food was great, unfortunately we tried to fit so much into our long weekend week didn't make the restaurant. Luckily the beds were so comfy we caught up on much needed sleep in the big airy rooms. 
We will definitely be back to this gem of a hotel. Thank you all for helping our much needed break in our favourite city every thing and more. ",5,2017,07,05
213,Enjoyable 7 Night Stay,"I very much enjoyed staying at the Herbert Park Hotel. I was in town for a conference at the RDS and then a few days of vacation. It was perfect, not just for it's proximity to the RDS, but the hotel itself and the surrounding area was great. My room was perfectly fine. It was not huge or notably fancy, but it had all that I needed. The room was very quiet and the bed very comfortable. As a matter of fact I slept for 12 hours the second night getting over jet lag and I don't think I've slept for 12 hours for maybe 12 years.

The food was very good. I had all of my breakfasts there and a couple of dinners and they were delicious. The staff was very friendly and helpful. There is a very small gym in the hotel that, according to the sign-in sheet, I was the only one using during my stay. 

The hotel is in the affluent neighborhood of Ballsbridge. It's right up against Herbert Park which is a very relaxing area to walk around in. The first day I was there I meandered and spent a fair amount of time watching locals play tag Rugby.

There are some good food options in the neighborhood outside of what the hotel offers. For a wonderful meal out I highly recommend The Lobster Pot, only about 300 feet from the hotel. The fresh, local seafood was superb and the owners and waitstaff are fantastic. Highly recommend.",5,2017,07,05
213,Short break in Dublin,"We had the most wonderful time in this gorgeous hotel. Nothing was too much trouble. Josef was particularly helpful in the bar and Lara on the reception desk. We will def be back. Breakfast had everything anyone could want. Many thanks.

213,Luxury stay,Our favourite hotel in Dublin. Immediately impressed when we were offered a free upgrade as we had stayed several times before. Very helpful staff sorted our various queries. Breakfast was slightly disappointing compared to before but we were down just before 10.,4,2017,07,04
213,One of the best,"Brilliant location for a lovely hotel. We booked out of another hotel because of a bad experienced and the Herbert Park made the trouble worthwhile. It really saved our trip, which otherwise could have been a disaster. ",5,2017,07,04

213,Nice hotel in a quiet area,"Not too far from the city centre, very helpful staff, single room was definitely on the smaller side with no chair and no tea/coffee facilities. There are lots of eating and drinking places close by, but for the price, the room should have been bigger I think.",4,2017,07,03
213,Business Trip,"My stay was excellent as always. I've stayed here on numerous occasions and I'll be back. The hotel location, the service level, the helpful staff all ensure that your stay is an enjoyable one. Check-in and check-out is always swift.

213,Very good,I stayed here a couple of nights after a less than successful Airbnb experience. I found the hotel very clean and comfortable. The staff were very helpful and it is an easy 25 min walk into the centre of Dublin or you can catch the regular bus almost at the door. One of the airport buses also goes past. I didn't eat breakfast at the hotel but had a late supper one night and the food was good.,5,2017,07,03
213,Excellent time!,"We enjoyed an overnight trip to Dublin staying in the wonderful Herbert Park hotel. Location, service, rooms and general facilities were all top notch. The facility to leave the car in the underground parking on our departure day until 6pm was particularly valued. Would happily go again :)",5,2017,07,02
213,Short Notice Weekend Stay,Last minute trip to Dublin. Delighted to be able to again stay in the Herbert Park Hotel. Beautiful setting on Herbert Park itself & so central to city centre Dublin also. The staff were most welcoming & friendly & our room was spotlessly clean. Plenty of nice restaurants close by. One of our favourite hotels in Dublin. ,4,2017,07,02
213,Lovely Herbert Park Hotel,"The hotel is in Ballsbridge, which is a very nice neighbourhood, close to many good restaurants and pubs.  The hotel is very welcoming.  Lara on the front desk was so helpful.   Our room was spacious, clean and pretty.  It had a comfortable king bed,  coffee maker, safe, USB charger/plug adapter and minibar.  The restaurant/breakfast room is very attractive. Good service at breakfast and a reasonable assortment to choose from.  It is situated next to beautiful Herbert Park.   A cab to the airport is 40 E cab and it is about a 10 E cab to Trinity College.",5,2017,07,01
213,Lovely hotel,"We stayed 3 nights and we're very comfortable. Only a 25-30 min walk to Dublin city centre. If you prefer, the bus system is friendly and close by. The hotel restaurant is very good but there are pubs and restaurants nearby as well. We liked the Bridge Pub and Rolls restaurant.",5,2017,07,01
213,Phil Collins concert stay,Stayed here the night before Concert at Aviva. Modern but atmospheric overlooking the park. Some nice restaurants within a few minutes walk. Great location for Aviva Stadium. Would definately stay again ,5,2017,06,30
213,Overnight stay to attend concert at RDS,"I chose this hotel because we were attending a concert at the RDS Arena and the hotel is within walking distance.  We enjoyed our stay and I would definitely stay here again.  I loved the breakfast - if I lived in Dublin I would go there just for that.  Special mention must be given to Dominic who was working at the check-in desk. Extremely professional, friendly and was an absolute pleasure to deal with.  ",5,2017,06,30
213,Experience at Herbert Park hotel,"All aspects of hotel excellent.Wonderful location,within walking distance of Dublin centre,restaurants etc.Car park secure,Staff incredibly helpful and friendly.Will certainly stay there again.Foyer area very relaxing ,lovely decor,very neat and tidy but not fussy,Buffet breakfast was plentiful and varied and well presented.Bar staff attentive but not intrusive,with table service.Room was spacious clean neat and tidy.There was adequate information in the room and the air conditioning system was simple to operate.",5,2017,06,29

I would definitely recommend this hotel it's well located for anyone attending events in the Aviva or RDS ,4,2017,06,29
213,"Nice hotel, but creedy - Razors and Foam cost money,","Everything is OK, room, breakfast, meal in restaurant, location
At the same time when I find out that I forgot th razor and foam receptionist did not offer razor kit komplimentary. I was offered to buy huge bottel of foam - like one in regular store. I did travel with hand luggade only and I did fine unreasonable and not firendly for ecology enviroment  to buy huge bottel of foam for one shave and than throw it to gagbage. Hotel cost for razor was 1 Euro. It was additional shhet of papre to print the bill for it, again hot enviroment friendly and looks stupid. So overall impression was not so good due to this hostel style hotel behavior.So that why I eveluate this potential excellent hotel as an average.",3,2017,06,29
213,Birthday getaway,From the moment we arrived the staff treated us with the utmost courtesy. I have a mobility problem and the staff went out of their way to be helpful. Our room was upgraded which was a pleasant surprise as I was there to celebrate a milestone birthday. The room was excellent and added to the enjoyment of our stay. We have stayed here on several occasions and have found the location ideal. The park in which the hotel sits is a huge asset for an evening stroll and is a great backdrop for the dining room which has glass from floor to ceiling the entire length of the wall. The city centre is within reasonably walking distance( I had the benefit of my mobility scooter). The food and service were of the highest standard. The only problem was I had to leave when my time was up. I have no reservations about recommending this hotel to anyone.,5,2017,06,28
213,Wonderful Stay,"This hotel was a wonderful welcome after 9 days in other various hotels.  The room was bright and fresh and the bathroom well lit with great amenities.  For those that like air conditioning...it worked beautifully and cool and comfortable our whole stay.  The staff was very friendly and helpful.  I cannot thank them enough for helping us navigate public transportation, the way to the stadium and more.  A very relaxing end to our vacation.",5,2017,06,28

213,Long weekend in Dublin Herbert Park Hotel,"We had a very nice stay for 4 days (3 nights) in the Herbert Park Hotel.
This Hotel was exactly what we expected for.It was calm and clean with a customer friendly personnel.
It is only about 15 minutes by bus from the city center.
",5,2017,06,27
213,LOVED this hotel,"I stayed here as part of a CIE tour, and out of the 6 hotels we stayed at, this one probably was my favorite. Considering it was the very first one, I find that impressive. Our visit started with a shot of whiskey as soon as we checked in -- a first for me in travel. Even though we were early, the staff got us into our rooms as quick as they could. What I was most impressed with, though, was the attentiveness of the wait staff. I ate lunch once and breakfast twice, in addition to having a drink in the bar, and I always felt VERY cared for. ",5,2017,06,27
213,Excelent hotel,"Very good rooms, they are bigs, confortables, cleans. Big bathroom, good service and nice situation. Walking to the center is like 15-20 minutes. Restaurants near, residential zone, and near of a big park.",4,2017,06,27
213,Disappointed ,"Had lunch with family and friends on Sunday 25th June. Lunch @€30 for three courses was ok . But having left about €500 for lunch and pre lunch drinks each of four car drivers was then charged an average of €10 each for parking. There may have been notices in the car park, but none in the hotel. On this basis I regarded this as a ripoff and advised reception accordingly. I also let them know I would be commenting negatively on Tripadvisor and giving an unfavourable rating. ",1,2017,06,27
213,"Beautiful hotel, perfect all around","I cannot put into words how great the staff were for our stay. We stayed only one night for a concert in the Aviva (a 5 minute walk away). I particularly dealt with Dominic, Davide, and Eugenija who could not do more to make our stay better. Thank you! ",5,2017,06,27
213,Concert trip,Great venue for attending aviva  or RDS and a very classy hotel but a bit over priced however. Great tea and coffee in room but a wee biscuit would have been nice. Staff were exceptional and very pleasant. ,4,2017,06,27
213,Very clean and good location,"Good location, friendly staff. Lovely room.
Not much information in the room about the local area etc.
No swimming pool and a little pricey for drinks (but comparable to most hotels in the area I should think)",4,2017,06,27
213,Outstanding serivce and great facilities.,"Outstanding hotel with friendly, accommodating, helpful staff members. The actual facility is clean, located in a safe area, has free wi-fi, parking, breakfast provided with certain room rates, computers and printers available if needed, nice workout facilities, can walk Herbert Park (our room had a gorgeous view of Herbert Park), and a bar with food service available. The hotel is easily accessible to city center and great for day trips out of Dublin.",5,2017,06,26

213,"Relaxing, warm and friendly staff","My husband and I stayed here for one night this weekend  to attend a gig in the Aviva stadium....just a short stroll away.  Our room was spacious, spotlessly clean and had a nepresso machine to boot.  We had dinner in the bright and airy bar and it was very tasty.  A buffet breakfast the folliowing day catered for all tastes.  We found the staff very warm and friendly and nothing was any bother to them.  Would highly recommend the hotel. There is a beautiful park on its doorsteps to walk off the big brekkie!  Looking forward to coming back",4,2017,06,26
213,"Great location, stylish hotel ","Stayed at the hotel last night as my sister and I were attending a concert in the Aviva. Disappointed there was no afternoon tea on offer - had been really looking forward to it! However, we spent a lovely afternoon in the relaxed and elegant Terrace Lounge where we enjoyed dinner and a lovely wine - the banana brownie was a hilight! The bedroom was spacious and faultless with a nespresso machine, bottled water and a well stocked mini bar. All staff friendly and efficient. Perfect spot for Aviva gigs (less than 10 min walk) but price reflects the location - €249 for room only. Overall an impressive and stylish hotel. Really enjoyed our stay!",4,2017,06,26
213,"Excellent hotel, close to RDS & Aviva stadium. ","Stayed here with my wife last night after Phil Collins gig. It is only a 10 minute dander from the Aviva Stadium Podium & Lansdown Lane entrances & is just round the corner from the RDS. 

We found the rooms to be clean, well appointed & the bed very comfortable. The Nespresso coffee machine is a nice touch too. 

After the concert the hotel bar filled quickly, but there were plenty of staff on hand & all were most helpful & friendly. 

There is onsite parking, incl underground, charged at €12 per night. Other day/hourly rates also apply. 

Didn't dine here as there are plenty of hostelries nearby. Bar prices are a bit steep but I guess that just Dublin costs though. ",4,2017,06,26
213,Superb hotel and location,"The Herbert Park hotel is located in the most ideal location to explore Dublin's main attractions. The hotel itself is modern, comfortable with excellent staff. This hotel is on a par with many five star hotels and is moderately priced.",5,2017,06,26
213,RDS location PERFECT,We booked here due to the doorstep location for the RDS. Couldn't fault the location for the venue. Hotel is beautiful reception area however rooms could do with upgrading. At nearly €200 a night I would have expected higher standards. ,3,2017,06,25
213,Restless stay,Poor attitude of staff. Not very helpfull. Hotel room was clean but was in room 233 and the noise from the air con unit was unreal all night. Got no sleep. Location was ok but confusing as to the entrance for parking.,3,2017,06,24
213,A Great place To Stay In Did blin,"The Hoyle msnagement and staff are eager to make you feel like you're staying with family. They are sensitive to guest's needs and expectations. We did not expect the highest level of service for the very competitive price we paid, and were pleasantly surprised to get it. THIS IS A MUST IF YOU ARE STSYING IN DUBLIN

",5,2017,06,23
213,Good Business Hotel near the Stadium,"We chose the Herbert Park because of it's proximity to Dún Laoghaire and our cruise ship. It is also near Aviva Stadium and RDS, multipurpose stadium. We arrived from an early flight and were prepared to store our bags and wait to check in. They were very accommodating and gave us a room immediately. Our room was spacious and clean. Even though there was a World Cup qualifier going on and there were fans, we were not put out in any way. The hotel is adjacent to Herbert Park, which is a pretty park for a stroll and near a few good restaurants and pubs. The breakfast at the hotel was OK but I feel a bit overpriced. That is minor to the overall experience.",4,2017,06,23
213,Paper Wedding Anniversary ,"Hotel was a touch of class, friendly staff and very welcoming. The bedroom is clean and comfortable and the hotel hosts a modest gym. With a room overlooking the attached park would put anyone in good form. The highlight however, was definitely the restaurant. Every forkful from beginning to end was incredible, every bite delivered a tasteful of pure goodness. The waiter was professional, warm and welcoming. Not to mention the very thoughtful 'Happy Anniversary' plate of mini deserts courtesy of the very talented chef and the cheerful waiter who made sure to pass on the happy occasion. ",5,2017,06,23
213,Great location,"Great location if attending the RDS. The rooms were comfortable and clean but could do with updating. Staff were friendly and helpful, especially Dominic at the reception desk. The park is literally on your doorstep and is very pleasant.",4,2017,06,23
213,Disappointed,Noise from construction site! Glass of wine nearly 10 euros! Rip off! Check in staff pre authorise your credit card for a lot more than your room cost in case you spend in hotel. Never experienced this before. Left my charger in room and was told I had to give them my credit for postage ( prob 85 cent) after leaving a lot of money there between my two groups. . ,3,2017,06,23
213,Fantastic,Great spacious room bed was really comfy. Staff were very helpful and friendly location was perfect as we were going to a concert in the aviva. Few nice bars across the road will definitely stay again,5,2017,06,22
213,"Great hotel, comfortable, very friendly","Great hotel, comfortable, very friendly, very good and rich breakfast, nice park great for running or relaxing, spacy rooms with all you need for a stay.

213,Great Location,"We stayed at the Herbert Park whilst attending a concert at the Aviva stadium, it is the perfect location for others wishing to do the same as it is a 10 minute walk. There is also parking at the hotel which saves any further trouble when arriving in Dublin on a busy day. 
The room was very comfortable.
To note; super shower and great hair dryer...always a plus!",5,2017,06,21
213,OK hotel. Not so good service,The hotel is OK but the service is not so good at all. The location is good but not central and it is definitely over priced. I have been to ask for a receipt of my stay but it has still been impossible to get them to solve my issue.,2,2017,06,20

213,excellent hotel in a quiet neighborhoods.,The hotel is located in a quiet neighborhoods next to a big park.  The room is spacious and easily fit our family of four (two kids).

The breakfast is standard but the service is excellent.  All the staff are nice and helpful.  Had a wonderful stay!,5,2017,06,19
213,"Quiet Location, Helpful Staff","The staff was extremely helpful even arranging transportation for us before we arrived.  They can us useful advice about what to see and where to eat.

Please keep up the good work best regards Alpha 1 Endurance Events,5,2017,06,19
213,The next time again Herbert Park Hotel,"The hotel is quiet and located very nicely. Can be easily reached by bus and train (also by bus from airport). The staff was wonderful! - I found, that the hotel prices in Dublin are generally extremely high, if one compares these with other EU countries.  ",5,2017,06,19
213,Great Hotel for a work trip,"THis hotel was great to stay in while I was in Dublin working. It was a great location from the office and had a wide range of places to drink and eat nearby.
The food in the Hotel was really good. I had the Chicken wings from the bar/terrace menu and it was delicious.
The bed was nice and comfy and the shower was powerful - two main things i look for in a hotel",5,2017,06,19
213,Enjoyable stay,"Everything was perfect, thank you. It would have been perfect if the doors were open accessing  the side terrace bordering Herbert Park, from the breakfast /dining room on such a sunny day. However all in all, we enjoyed our stay.",5,2017,06,19
213,MK Review,"All good, would prefer shower not bath/shower, staff very friendly, we wanted food when we came back from concert but couldn't get even a sandwich . Got room service and sandwich was not good. Room nice and spacious, great location so hope to return.Excellent service in bar area. Car park spaces are a little tight.............................................................................................",5,2017,06,19
213,CONCERT VISIT,"Hotel was fab - only issue was price of food.  Very expensive so venture outside for food other than that great stay. Plenty of bars and restaurants right on your doorstep and walking distance to Aviva. Will definitely use again for concerts.
",5,2017,06,19
213,Fantastic place to stay,"I have just recently had occasion to stay at this hotel and I have to say it was a pleasure. The staff are so friendly and helpful and the rooms are amazing. My room overlooked the Herbert Park and it was lovely to see and hear the sounds of the park, while I was working from my room.
The food is also very good and a good selection to choose from the menu.
It's proximity to Dublin city is ideal and it had ample parking.
I would recommend this hotel to anyone on business, or just visiting Dublin .

213,Herbert Park Stay 12th to 16th June 2017,"Friendly and helpful staff, clean and decent sized rooms with expected amenities of a quality hotel, , decent choice of food and beverage, Perhaps it would be good to change the lounge menu more frequently, but overall a very pleasant stay",5,2017,06,18
213,"nice hotel, great location for RDS, but pricy","lovely hotel for a special occasion, more than we required. great location for RDS. Room comfottablr, temperature control great, room coffee machine a great gadget butI didnt like the coffee! Bar meals pricy, breakfast best value at fifteen euro (prebooked rate), staffhelpful, not especially  friendly but dont if that is what other guests expect. ",3,2017,06,18
213,Pleasant as ever accept food,"I have stayed many times with you and love the place. I had two food issues though. I ordered fish and chips for lunch. It was ok at best. The fish was soggy, there was a ramackan of mushy peas that was just dried up and chips were hard, my view, it was under the light maybe from a previous order. Then for breakfast the continental buffet was beautiful but again the cooked breakfast was cold, sausages and bacon hard and cool, hash browns which should be crispy were soggy and broken. I would suggest pre cooking too much is a dangerous strategy as quality is compromised. ",4,2017,06,17
213,Love this hotel but next time I'll try and and avoid the fan outside room 106 :),"Love this hotel but next time I'll try and and avoid the fan outside room 106 :)

213,GOOD HOTEL FOR BUSINESS TRIP,"Just returned from a 1 night stay at Herbert Park for a Business Trip. This was my second visit to the hotel and I would recommend it for a business stay. It is not always the cheapest hotel in the area, however you get what you pay for. Rooms are modern and clean, hotel staff are friendly and the hotel is in a good location.     ",4,2017,06,16
213,Nice business hotel,"Nice business hotel, perfectly located in Ballsbridge, close to the city centre and the Stadium. Small, but clean and nice rooms, the breakfast is okay and the bar is very comfortable. The staff is really friendly and helpful.",4,2017,06,16
213,Beautiful hotel!,"Rooms were beautiful and very quiet, and the staff was helpful and friendly.  It was a bit of a walk to get to the city center, but there are pubs close by and a great bar and comfortable lounge in the hotel.  Our only complaint was that the bed was a little flat. However the front desk remedied that quickly by having a duvet added for a nice cozy sleep the next night!!  We enjoyed our stay immensely!!  Keep in mind that they charge €8 per night for parking and breakfast is €15 per person/day.  This was our last stop after a lot of traditional Irish breakfasts, so we did not eat breakfast at the hotel.",5,2017,06,16
213,Perfect,"Location perfect, room perfect, staff perfect.  Not central so quiet nights sleep.  Early check was a bonus as well as we didn't expect the room to be ready.  Definitely will stay again and highly recommend to anyone visiting Dublin but wants a quieter hotel.  Landsdowne Road train station a 5 minute walk and 4 Euro return ticket which was great.",5,2017,06,15
213,Amazing Everything !!!!,"I stayed in Dublin Ireland for a total of 10 day.  What a beautiful city,  This hotel was just gorgeous and quite lovey and modern.  The quality of the staff, food, service, room, and décor was second to none. The waitresses were impeccable and quite efficient.  One waiter in particular was a Croatian gentlemen. Very nice young man.   I had a burger and it was absolutely scrumptious.  Well seasoned and needed no other condiment. Breakfast in the morning was fresh and very good. I just loved this newly decorated and modern hotel.  Great price !!!!!!  Thank you for making my stay truly wonderful.",5,2017,06,13
213,Disappointing stay !,I asked if we could check in early but got no communication from hotel. So we arrived at 4 to be told it would be 40 mins before room was ready but we would be told when it was ready. We had to ask again and didn't get keys until 6.15.  My daughter had flown from US that morning and needed sleep. Food and drinks very expensive. ,2,2017,06,13
213,Conference,"Held a three day conference at the Herbert Park for 40 delegates from across Europe. The Staff at the Herbert Park were simply amazing throughout the 3 days, nothing was too much trouble and they were happy to accommodate change requests. The food was great quality and there was plenty of it. 

A BBQ was held on one of the days and this was a great success with delegates commented on quality of food. Service of staff throughout the hotel was superb.",5,2017,06,13
213,Very nice,"This is a very nice, well run hotel. We stayed as part of a tour group and weren't expecting perfection but were pleasantly surprised. Beautiful facility, very good, very well run restaurant and lounge. One night it was busy due to a rugby tournament, but the staff handled the crowd perfectly.   I was worried we were too far from the Dublin city center, but a bus 1/2 block away takes you right to Trinity College. 3 blocks away is the Dart train that lets you explore neighboring towns. We spent the morning in Dalkey!  The hotel is next to pretty Herbert Park. And there are several pubs & restaurants right across the street. We only had 2 nights but managed to check out Bridge 1859, Crowes Pub and Al Boschetto (great Italian/wonderful staff). ""Only"" 4 stars cuz I wished it was downtown. ",4,2017,06,13
213,In room television,I think there should be a movie selection on the television. I found the program selection to be lacking. There can  be an additional charge to the room bill if there was a movie selection and maybe more US programming.,5,2017,06,13
213,Excellent Location Beautiful hotel,Hotel is in a perfect location in a lovely area. Close to the Aviva stadium and baggot street. Beautiful lobby and rooms. Easy check in and check out and very friendly and helpful staff. Will definitely stay here again. ,5,2017,06,13
213,Family Stay,"Overall a very pleasant stay, for the use of a room thought it was quite expensive. Didn't think enough milk in room for coffee and tea with machine. All reception staff were first class, couldn't have been more helpful. Location for the main purpose of our trip to see the football was perfect.",4,2017,06,13
213,Excellent hotel,I loved this hotel. It is modern comfortable and spotless. The staff are very friendly and efficient. Breakfast was excellent.

213,one day at the Herbert Park Hotel,"My stay was short, but very comfortable, clean and the staff were helpful.  Checkout is at 12, which is great. The breakfast buffets were amazing. I loved the freshness and the healthyness of the products. For instance, choice honey, honeycombe, fruit, bread gluten free etc. The garden looked very appealing. It rained so never walked in it. Area is very quiet. Rooms are spacious. ",5,2017,06,11
213,Great Hotel,This hotel is in a great location and the staff is incredible. Egle was working the front desk and spent 20 minutes with me telling me where to go and helping me get tickets for a sporting event I wanted to attend. Everything about the hotel is great and the people that work here live up to the great reputation of Ireland hospitality!,5,2017,06,11
213,Good location,Good location but I had problems with the air conditioning in the room during the night. Had to turn it off eventually and didn't sleep well at all. Not really good enough considering the price paid for rooms in this establishment!,3,2017,06,10
213,Great!,"Herbert Park was our stay when visiting Dublin for business. The hotel is not really central situated but Dublin is not that big. The rooms where good equipt with all accessories you need.

Breakfast was Nice and had a high quality",4,2017,06,09
213,Hosted business seminar,"Great place, clean, well appointed rooms.  Nice setting next to Herbert Park to enjoy a walk. Central location makes it easy to get around. Staff was very helpful and we all found the food very good. 

We hosted a group of about 25 people for an educational seminar.

213,Great spot for parents visit,Had my parents visiting me for 4 nights. They were really happy with the hotel. It is about 30min by foot to central parts of the city. The location of the hotel is beautiful and calm. I would recommend the stay for others as well.  ,4,2017,06,09

213,Surprise In Ireland!,"Stayed at this hotel for the last leg of our CIE Tour. The surprise was no Irish accents. I am not sure where the staff was from but nonetheless they were all very hospitable and accommodating. It was a very nice way to end our tour. The location was on the outskirts of Dublin. In order to get anywhere, you need transport which the staff were ready to call for you.",5,2017,06,07
213,Enjoyed very much,"Just stayed one night but it was pleasent and would definitely stay there again. The only thing that was annoying there was no full length mirror in the room we had but that's only nit picking. Lovely food and very friendly staff. We arrived early and didn't expect to have our room ready, we just wanted to dump our bags so we could go off shopping. Had some lunch which was lovely and same with deserts. YUM!! Will stay here again!",5,2017,06,07
213,Great stay!,"Really enjoyed my stay in Herbert Park. The room was large, bright, comfortable and modern. Special mention should also be given to the staff who were incredibly helpful, informative and just friendly for our entire stay. Couldnt rate them highly enough.",5,2017,06,07

Brilliant cafes., walks and cocktail bar called the bridge close by 

",4,2017,06,07
213,Cannot find fault with this hotel,"Stayed here for four nights while attending a conference at Trinity College.  It is a couple of kilometres from the city centre but if you catch the bus like a local it is very easy to get around at low cost.  The hotel itself is clean, comfortable, and modern, and located beside a beautiful park.  There are shops, restaurants and at least one pub across the road.",5,2017,06,06
213,Nice Hotel,"I recommend this hotel, rooms are quite comfortable, though not big, breakfast is excellent, as is service.  Good location for meetings nearby at RDS for example. Nearby convenient bus routes to airport and city centre.",5,2017,06,06
213,A very fine hotel,"I have been a guest at the Herbert Park many times in recent years and find it has consistently high standards throughout. I find I can rely on the Hotel to deliver a good service, good food and a good nights sleep. This Hotel must be one of Dublin's best. ",5,2017,06,06
213,Nice business trip and stay at the Herbert Part Hotel,"The hotel is nice and everything what is expected from a 4 star hotel is there. It can turn out to be pricey at the end if you are staying there for 5 nights - be prepared to pay about 1000 euro. 
The rooms are clean and well-maintained, the breakfast was good. The omelette was a bit soggy and the bacon was not crispy. They are very frugal on cheese. Only two small elevators service the whole building - it was very packed and crowded in the morning. ",4,2017,06,06
213,Top Class Hotel in the perfect Location,"Best Hotel in this area of Dublin .Secure parking .Excellent selection of bars & restaurants on your door step. Comfortable clean rooms .Only negative for me is the cost and quality of the pre cooked breakfast.,so whenever I stay I book room only .
",5,2017,06,06
213,Good hotel,"The hotel room was very nice, the breakfast service was excellent and the staff was friendly. The hotel also has a gym, although I did not have time to use this during my stay this was appreciated. The hotel is loacted in a beautiful part of Dublin with a very nice park right outside.
The only downside was the price for staying, which is why I would be hesitant to recommend it.",4,2017,06,06
213,Excellent hotel service and close enough to major attractions,"The hotel is next to Herbert Park and Royal Dublin Society--with a very nice environment, amenities, restaurant. Staff are very helpful in taxi and restaurant reservations and with check-out billing process. The reservation staff was also very helpful and responsive. Just a little far from City Center but that is just a short taxi ride away (walkable from the Trinity College/Grafton Street area). ",4,2017,06,05
213,Excellent Hotel ,"I have a very pleasant stay in this hotel. In the room I got everything I needed. It really convenient to have a Nespresso machine in the room with everything you need for an excellent cup of coffee or tee. The machine is refilled with fresh water every day. I really appreciate this service. Fresh mineral water was provided every day as well. 
Very carefully cleaned bath make me feel very comfortable. The room is big enough and comfortable. 
Very friendly and helpful staff. The food there is also excellent. I enjoyed my breakfast and lunch every day. 
It is also convenient to take the public transport to get to downtown.   ",5,2017,06,05
213,Nice hotel in a nice location,"The hotel is situated in a very nice neighborhood next to beautiful Herbert Park and in close proximity to several restaurants and pubs. The RDS is just across the street, so very convenient if you are attending an event there. The city center is a good 20-25 minute walk or a short bus ride. The rooms are large, comfortable and clean, although slightly outdated. Free wi-fi available everywhere. Excellent breakfast with tons of choices. The staff was very friendly and helpful. I would stay there again",4,2017,06,05
213,Lovely place,"Staff were very friendly and always helpful. Very professional as well. The hotel is clean and our room was perfect. Had a great night's sleep. Ordered some room service on Saturday night which was quick and again the staff was very helpful.
The only thing I was surprised about, there was no baked beans with the cooked breakfast #shocked",5,2017,06,05
213,"Great location, great food in Ballsbridge","Very nicely situated in Ballsbridge with plenty of amenities and access to public transport.

213,Fabulous Standard,"Just stayed one night in  the Herbert Park Hotel and it was 5* all the way. Great location, great price, more than great breakfast and everybody was so helpful especially the reception crew. First time here but a definite return visit going to be planned for longer. Totally recommended ",5,2017,06,04

213,Not even an apology,"Good, comfy mattress, good quality sheets
Lots of space in the wardrobe
And
Hair on the bathroom floor (lots of it)
Bathrobe used by a former guest (traces of fluid so obvious at the neckline)
Hairdryers with the motion sensor, not working well
Very slow service at breakfast, had to ask for coffee 3 times and in fact the receipt was earlier than the order...
Food at the restaurant very good however service not trained - kind and friendly but with hardly any knowledge 

The biggest surprise for me was - when I called reception to explain what I have found in the room, there was not a word of apology, service was improved as the bathroom was clean in the evening but nobody even admitted there was something wrong or substandard.",3,2017,06,04
213,Stay away from restaurant!,"I met some colleagues here for dinner with the plan to have some cocktails then sit down to eat.  Arrived at the bar and there were 3 or 4 of us.  1 bartender who didn't even look like he wanted to be there.  Gave me a glass of warm soda - no ice!  Then another fellow showed up to help.  2nd guy didn't know anything on the cocktail menu and had to ask the bartender who got even more annoyed.  This should have been the first clue.

Dinner - I ordered steak - med rare closer to rare side.  Came out medium.  I looked over at my colleagues steak and found out she had mushrooms, none on mine!  Rest of the dinner was so so, flavors were bland.  Then came tea and I asked for some milk.  Forgot to bring it but never came back to check on us - so went to the bar (same bartender) told him I wanted to some milk - went to the bathroom and still no milk!  I had to back to the bar and ask a 2nd time.

Not a top tier place.  Funny thing is, I think that's what most people thought too as the restaurant had 1 or 2 other guest for dinner.",1,2017,06,04
213,No complaints,Pretty hotel with friendly service and a very nice breakfast every day in the dining room looking out at the park. It is very convenient to the Royal Dublin Society. There are some very good gastro pubs and restaurants within a few blocks.  On a nice day the walk to the city centre is very pleasant. ,5,2017,06,03
213,very good,"Very nice rooms and very pleasant employees. The only problem was with miscommunication, because I was told when I arrived to the hotel that everything is already paid. I had to talk to the Atradius team, who then explained to the receptionist that I have to pay for the hotel on my own. ",4,2017,06,03
213,Russell lamont,"The staff in hotel were very good and excellent in the bar . Our bed room was clean , quiet , spacious  and had a great view over Dublin.

213,An experience with a little let down,The breakfast was cold on the Saturday morning which was disappointing and then when I asked for a cappuccino I was informed that I would have to pay extra and that was after us paying €530 for bed and breakfast for two nights. I was also disappointed that having paid that amount of money we also had to pay €24 to park the car. I think this is a shame when you charge so much money for the stay in the hotel. Apart from that the hotel was very good and staff were lovely.,3,2017,05,31
213,Herbert park hotel stay,"Herbert Park stay, over all good. But the underground parking lot is badly design and expensive. Park outside the hotel instead. Over all my stay was good and the stay friendly and helpful. God location, Herbert Park is location right beside the hotel ad is nice for a walk, ponds, ducks etc. ",4,2017,05,31
213,Great Location for our Charity golf game,"My husband and I stayed here as we were attending a charity golf match in Powerscourt.

213,consistently smart hotel in a great location,"Have stayed a few times over the years, with children and without.  The hotel is very smart and comfortable.  The staff are really pleasant and helpful.  It's good value if you can get an offer.  The bedrooms always seem to have a huge bedroom and the bathrooms are of a high standard.  The walk into Dublin city centre is through lovely, leafy avenues but you don't need to go into the centre for good bars, shops and restaurants. Nearby Baggott Street has a great selection of these.",5,2017,05,30
213,Excellent Choice,"Beautiful Room with stunning views. Breakfast was perfect with an excellent choice and lovely views of the park.
Staff were just right, attentive but not interfering. Fast check in and no problems incurred. Got an upgrade so that was a faboulous bonus. ",5,2017,05,30
213,"Amazing staff, great for business/group bookings","I booked over 20 rooms in the Herbert Park for a 3-4 day business trip to Dublin.  The staff were very professional.  They treated my guests as good as I treated them.  They were able to accommodate us all for dinner although we gave them very short notice and had less than an hour to order the food, eat the appetizers and main course. They also helped pass on messages/letters to my clients when needed. The buffet lunch we organized in the hotel was perfect and the room was very suitable especially given the amount of natural light it had.",5,2017,05,30
213,Top hotel," Excellent hotel. Immaculate inside  and out. Dominic greeted us and Davide helped us check out. They could not have been more helpful  and with a pleasant manner.  Bar staff are also excellent. Service with a smile. Our room was pristine and the housekeeping staff all greet you with a smile and good morning. Top place in Dublin to stay for me. ",5,2017,05,30
213,Too Expensive,"We stayed on night , in Dublin for a Rugby game. The hotel had increased it's rate as a large crowd was expected. Add to that the charge for car parking !!   We were late booking and couldn't get any other hotel , so you had us by the balls. ",3,2017,05,29
213,Spaciousness ,"Location ideal for RDS and Aviva In lovely setting with Herbert Park presenting as ideal for a quiet stroll Hotel itself exudes "" space"" Room most comfortable with lovely view on 3rd floor overlooking Dublin and Aviva Staff could not be more helpful Underground parking with need I say it spacious car parking spaces reasonably priced View over Herbert Park at breakfast is a delight to behold ",5,2017,05,29
213,Pro 12 final,Everything great except pillows and duvet.... they definitely need to be upgraded. Well stocked mini bar and clean rooms clean. Perfect location if your going to Aviva stadium. 5 mins taxi into town or 20 mins walk.,4,2017,05,29
213,"A great surprise, wonderful experience","I arrived to the hotel only to join my husband who was in a conference there. My expectations were low but our experience was great. We slept at the hotel (my husband, my three years old daughter and me) for three days. The room was very comfortable and large enough for all beds.
The room include free coffee, tea, complementary mineral water (4 bottles a day) and a minibar which is basically a very convenient refrigerator that we used for some food that we bought in the nearby supermarket.
Breakfast is perfect, delicious and extremely reach.
The hotel reside near the Herbert park which is beautiful.

We had a nice view of the town from our room and enjoyed the buffet breakfasts.  Very easy walk to pubs and restaurants.,5,2017,05,28
213,Pricey but great location and service.,"Well located in the Ballsbridge area of Dublin. Walking distance to Ciry center for those who like long walks. Bus and Dart lines are close by. Many good restaurant options outside on Merrion Street and 10 to 15 minutes walk towards city center. Staff is friendly and attentive. Room is spacious, clean and modern. Easy parking underground. Herbert park behind the hotel provides a relaxing venue for strolling away from pedestrian and auto traffic. Pricey, but to be fair there was a major international Rugby game at the RDS opposite during my stay.",4,2017,05,28
213,70thBirthday,"Excellent hotel. Good food and great location. Buses, pubs and restaurants within walking distance. Highly recommend. Staff is very attentive and the breakfast is a nice variety.

213,Back Again,"Another very pleasant stay at the Herbert Park, staff are as helpful and pleasant as ever, location is great and if coming from out of town car parking is easy, lounge food is of a good standard as are the breakfasts overlooking the beautiful Herbert Park. But most of all is the general relaxing feel of the hotel, a great place to chill out in the city.",5,2017,05,28
213,Excellent,"Maybe advise if upgrade is available on arrival as we would have been happy to pay extra for appropriate upgrade. Room with bathrobes and bigger bathroom would have been nice. Thank you for asking for our opinion. Keep up the good work.

213,Great time and great service,We stayed here at the beginning and end of our epic wedding in Ireland Lara was really exceptional and made us feel at home.  10 Eurocab ride at us at the heart of Dublin    The Bridge next door is also worth a visit owned by an Irish International Rugby player.  We will be back and recommend to friends and family,5,2017,05,27
213,Excellent Hotel,"Greeted by competent friendly staff, who were very helpful. Our room was spacious and clean with a lovely view of the Park.

213,Herbert Park the best hotel in Dublin,"I've stayed at many hotels in Dublin over the last 9 months on my weekly business trips to the city and the Herbert Park by far is my favourite. The hotel staff are some of the friendliest and most helpful I've ever encountered and I cannot recommend the hotel highly enough - lovely rooms, great food a home from home.",5,2017,05,26
213,Trip to Irland,"We were invited to a birthday party, and because we stayed  already twice in your hotel we decided to come back to your hotel. Also we needed a room with a bathroom for handicapped. We would have preferred a walk in shower. Why do waste so much water in Ireland? Why walking into a bath if a shower can be so much easier and less dangerous? Look at the age of your clients. I will come back. ",5,2017,05,25
213,Excellent hotel!,I very much enjoyed our study here. The staff was wonderful and very helpful while there. They arranged our taxi leaving and was a very smooth checkout process. I'd return again. The breakfast was delicious as well.,4,2017,05,25

Room was very clean and comfortable! 
I also enjoyed walking in the Herbert Park every  morning, which was really refreshing.
I'll use this hotel again, when I visit Dublin again.",5,2017,05,24
213,Nice location between UCD and city center,"I chose this hotel because of its location in-between the UCD (I was attending a conference there) and the city center. The hotel is located in an area with several dining options, not too far from public transport, and adjacent to a nice park. The hotel itself was very nice, room clean, breakfast good and staff very friendly and helpful.",4,2017,05,24
213,Great!,"Nice spacious rooms, massive bed, good room cleaning service every day, helpful staff, just at the edge of a a lovely park. Location within a longish walk into town or UCD which was my destination for the time I was there as I was there for a conference. So the location worked adequately for me for both daytime and night time. Very friendly staff indeed, as indeed were all the Irish people I met.Very comfortable stay.  Airbus, which goes to the airport also stopped and picked up 2 mins from the hotel - ideal.  ",4,2017,05,24
213,My Review,"I arrivaled this hotel business. The service is good, but there should have some disposable slippers and disposable combs in the room which will be more convinent for clients. The price of the hotel is a little higher and the room is too narrow. The scenary arround the hotel is goog, espically the park. On the whole, I like this hotel.",4,2017,05,22
213,Fine hotel in a nice area,"As during my last stays this is an optimal choice when you are in Dublin : a little bit outside and low traffic noise during night. Close to the city to be there in short time.
Fine for the money we paid.",5,2017,05,22
213,Exceptional hotel,"The staff were excellent even when dealing with a room full of youngsters following first communion. Nothing was too much trouble, and we would love to return as soon as possible. We had travelled from South Wales ",5,2017,05,22
213,Overnight stay,"My Experience at Herbert Park Hotel was excellent and will stay again when in Dublin. We were attending an awards ceremony at another location , so taxi was ordered promptly and there was no delay . Easy parking facility, Staff service was very good , room was very comfortable & spacious .
An enjoyable stay was had .",5,2017,05,22
213,Rugby Trip,"Great place to stay for the Leinster Match in the RDS.  The location was great will be back for definite.

Parking was easily found.",5,2017,05,22
213,A great place to stay in Dublin,We stay at the Herbert Park Hotel many times each year. Enjoying our visits for both Business and pleasure there is always a wonderful welcome and quick check-in.

213,weekend away,Booked herbert park as need a central hotel as a base - proved to be an excellent choice and certainly a place we will come back to if visiting again - pleasant staff and facilities all very clean - location is very good and Herbert park itself to the rear of the hotel is a nice place to walk on a sunday morning,4,2017,05,22
213,Beautiful area,The hotel is beside a nice park and the lobby is beautiful. Rooms are nice but on the smaller side. Beds were very comfortable. Easy buses to get downtown. Staff were super friendly and helpful. Enjoyed our stay,4,2017,05,22
213,Dublin stay,"The hotel was clean and staff friendly. The food in the hotel was just ok. Had breakfast sent via room service and the scrambled eggs were not edible. Cold toast and fatty meats. The restaurant was never open during what we'd consider normal times, 10am and noon. We were told to eat on a couch in the lobby lounging area. Weird. Aside from that, the stay was fine. Maybe one of the best places to stay around Dublin, I don't really know. But for the five days we stayed there, it worked.",3,2017,05,22
213,Lovely Hotel,"Booked this hotel due to its excellent location beside the RDS Arena, we really enjoyed our stay, beautiful hotel, very, friendly staff, got a complementary upgrade to an executive room which was also beautiful. Would highly recommend it. ",5,2017,05,21
213,Not up to scratch,"not great quality hotel overall, the foyer is the most modern part of the hotel and the website makes this hotel look more glam and modern than it is, breakfast awful (dont get the scrambelled eggs), not very professional front of house staff. not very well sound proofed. I stayed for one week as I was here from london from work. I wouldnt say this hotel had the same level of comfort as other hotels (4 star) that I have stayed in Dublin",2,2017,05,21
213,Nice stay in Dublin,"Hotel has easy check in, most amenities, and a beautiful park adjacent to the property. The full Irish breakfast option at breakfast was a bit lacking but still very good. Only missing amenity was an iron in the room. But overall great hotel experience. ",5,2017,05,21
213,Good Stay,"I have short but good moments in the hotel. The view of my room was not interesting but the Herbert Park was so beautiful.
In my opinion If you provide slippers in the rooms is better.

213,Excellent hotel in a nice location close to city centre,"I have stayed in the Herbert Park many times on business and never disappointed.  The friendliness of staff and great service are as good if not better than anywhere else in Dublin while the excellent standard of accommodation doesn't quite match the Shelbourne or Merrion, at considerably less than half the price of the city's finest it is exceptionally good value.",5,2017,05,13

",5,2017,05,12
213,Lovely hotel with fantastic friendly staff,I found this hotel to be fantastic.  I can;t say enough about the staff and how friendly they all were without exception from check in to check out.  The only 1 tiny little first world problem I had was that instead of the double room with king size bed we got a triple room with 3 single beds (2 pushed together as a double) and I would have preferred the king bed but as I say thats a first world problem and wasn;t really a big deal just a personnal preference.   Also the room was a quite hot but they do have air conditioning and it was extremely warm in dublin when we stayed.  ,5,2017,05,12
213,Fantastic Hotel,"A Fantastic Hotel. The staff are brilliant, the rooms are spacious and modern. The Breakfast is second to none, I could not recommend the highly enough. Thanks to all the staff who make my stay enjoyable every time. ",5,2017,05,12

213,Excellent,"Very nice, luxurous place to stay. Next to park, which is good for breaks during business meetings. It's about 45 minutes walk to the city center. So, if that's your main purpose of your stay, I would recommend to look for a place closer to the centre. ",5,2017,05,11
213,Super stay,"Beautiful hotel in great location. Decor perfect. Rooms spacious and very good service. 
A group of us were celebrating my birthday and all got early check ins as requested. My husband and I were upgraded which was lovely overlooking the Park.

213,"Great service, very clean","Stayed here for a week in May. I aerobes early, around 9a, and while I waited for my room, I worked in the cafe in the lobby. Wonderful service and the food was tasty. When my room was ready at 10a, everything was so clean. The decor is current and in good condition. Oh, and the bed was amazing. If I hadn't been jet lagged I would've slept for days.",5,2017,05,08
213,Excellent hotel,"This is a superb hotel and is beautifully decorated with fantastic modern art. The staff are extremely welcoming and helpful. There is a natural flow to their enthusiasm rather than the usual pro forma patter. 
A wonderful breakfast finished off a splendid evening. I wholeheartedly recommend this hotel to locals and to visitors. Enjoy.",5,2017,05,08
213,Family Trip,"We were satisfied with our stay, our room was clean, the staff was friendly and helpful. The Hotel was easily located and the location was also convenient for our stay in Dublin. The only issue we had was the need to pay for parking, although the price of parking was affordable...",4,2017,05,08
213,One night stay,Bright and airy interior. Very friendly and helpful staff. Reasonably priced compared to others in the area. Very much enjoyed our stay. Good location. Difficult to navigate getting in to car park and had to pay €12 to park as a guest.,4,2017,05,08
213,Exceeded expectations,"I stayed for 2  nights this week on a business trip.  I had stayed there a few years back but was not minded to return.
It exceeded my expectation.  Lovely room and quiet - which I asked for.  Good bar and food.  Sufficient toiletries and face flannels - one thing I can't cope with being left without.  Nice staff.  Great location.
There are only 2 minor comments - my room had a dearth of power points.  I had to unplug a lamp on the other side of the room to charge my laptop and wait until that was done to charge my phone.
On one night I ate in I had fish and chips - and I asked for vinegar.  After a few minutes I was presented with a tin sauce boat full of balsamico - not even Italians would try and put balsamic vinegar on their chips.  So I asked for ordinary vinegar and another sauce boat was presented but will distilled vinegar, usually used for pickling, instead of malt vinegar.  Just put a bottle of Sarsons vinegar on the table with the salt - don't lose the run of yourself - it's Ireland.
I would return without a doubt.  And I got a good deal too.
One last thing - brilliant free wifi everywhere in the hotel.",4,2017,05,07
213,Wonderful!,"My Gran and I had a lovely stay here - incredibly hospitable, friendly and helpful staff, clean facilities, and yummy bar food. Big plus for location - just a quick walk to the nearest rail station, and less than a five minute walk to multiple pubs and restaurants, a tiny grocer, and a pharmacy! 10/10 would stay here again. ",5,2017,05,07
213,"Great location, fantastic staff and clean comfortable rooms","I recently visited Dublin with my girlfriend for a quick weekend break. I usually deal with the bookings but this was a present for my birthday and she didn't let me down!

A big thank you to Davide at reception who was very knowledgeable and friendly upon arrival and on checkout. We wanted to visit the zoo (new baby elephant born only 1 month ago) and he kindly pointed out which bus we should take and from where. He also showed us some good spots for dining, drinking etc within dublin centre and gave us a map to take away. This proved to be very useful!

To arrive from the airport to the hotel is so easy. We caught the air coach from terminal 1 and it dropped us off 1 min walk from the hotel. The hotel itself is located a little out of the centre - about 30 minute walk which was really nice as we walked off the main road and past all of the embassy buildings. The location itself is a nice setting - off the main road and right next to Herbert Park.

Our room was great - clean, spacious and very airy. We had a corner room against the park side and the windows spread the whole way around two corners of the room so it was a pleasure to wake up in the morning and open the curtains whilst using the in room nespresso machine to make a hot cup of coffee.

We didn't utilise the breakfast at the hotel although it looked very good. We did try a cafe (1 min walk) called Rolys Cafe which I would highly recommend for breakfast... for €9 you can get a full irish breakfast with coffee and all the ingredients were high quality and a very nice ambience.

Overall I couldn't fault the hotel and had a very pleasant stay. Thanks again to Davide and the team for making life easy.

213,"Decent hotel, a bit old, but clean... and the forkdropper's dilemma","I was torn between writing a short negative review about a stupid (there is no better word) thing that I witnessed and a balanced review that I typically intend to write. Eventually, the latter won, and I hope it can be still helpful to some + also that hotel staff can read it and take steps to prevent that sort of stupidity from happening.
So, first, the pros: 
Location is relatively good, especially if you visit some business in the area. A number of pubs and shops around and relatively easy to get there. I'd say this is a good hotel for business visit, and not for sightseeing - a bit harder to get to the city center from there unless you get taxi, or hop on the train (I have not tried, but it looks relatively close). 
Mind you it is in South Dublin and getting there from the airport via taxi takes a while (45mins-1.5h in heavy traffic). Take the tunnel (10 EUR) and toll (2.5EUR or so) if possible. Ask the taxi driver though as sometimes going 'normal' way even touching the city center may be actually faster (on the way from the airport I took the tunnel/toll, and on the way back taxi driver took a 'normal' route after we got stuck trying to get to the toll+tunnel).
The hotel is a bit old, but quite clean and was a decent place to go back to at night. The receptionist staff was polite and extremely fast for both check-in and check out. I am a big fan of ppl doing it quickly and it was a pleasant experience.
The breakfast was all right. A bit of everything from a mix of Irish, English, continental breakfast + flapjacks were very tasty and fruit platters offered good sweet melon and pineapple, so all in all good. As far as I can tell, everything in the room worked perfectly. Quite a few TV channels, mainly Irish and English.
The cons: The hotel doesn't serve food after 10. Only some sandwiches and chips, so was a bit disappointed as I was starving and could only get a warm meal after I came back from the office at night. This is also where I witnessed the aforementioned stupid situation. I ordered the sandwich with a salad, the guy brought it to the room and while walking in he dropped the fork. Obviously, I noticed that and was expecting him to pick it up and go and bring me a new one. To my 'surprise' the guy just picked it up from the floor and put it on my plate. And right in front of me. Holy cow... In my books this is a firable offence. It's not about whether it is a big deal or not, but the fact the guy who is supposed to serve food doesn't even care about it is appalling, Let alone the fact I am a customer and he ruins the hotel's brand right in front of my eyes. All the good impression I got from the receptionist evaporated that instant. How can someone expose himself in such way on a professional level - this doesn't fit in my head! After my immediate reaction ('Are you kidding me?' You dropped it on the floor!!!') he said some vague 'sorry' and went out. He came back a bit later and offered me a different set. Let me say that at this stage I didn't trust him  at all and didn't touch the salad and only ate the sandwich. I was thinking of calling the manager, but eventually was too tired to follow-up and went to sleep. 
One such individual can ruin other people's work in no time. I really hope the hotel staff can look into it and at least ensure that other guests can be spared similar experiences.",2,2017,05,05
213,A Terrific Location for a Dublin Stay,"My husband and I stayed at the Herbert Park Hotel for four nights toward the end of April 2017. From the warm welcome when we checked in until we checked out, we thoroughly enjoyed our stay. The location has lots of pubs and restaurants close by and is an easy walk to city center.

Do not provide your phone number or e-mail address to the hotel when you check in. Within a day of checking in at the Herbert, all 8 members of our party started receiving spam/scam phone calls and e-mails. It is very clear that they sold our information off to a third party with no awareness as to where the information was going.",3,2017,05,03

213,Very disappointing ,"We went to celebrate a colleagues 40th birthday after a lovely lunch at Kites Chinese restaurant close by. I ordered a bottle of Tattinger champagne for obvious reasons. 40 minutes later we were told there was none because of confirmations the previous day. Are they serving champagne to young people?

They did have vintage Tattinger at more than twice the price as an alternative! I ordered a bottle of Chablis instead.

Management approached us to apologise but failed to recognised that if they had told us earlier we would have gone to The French Paradox five minutes away.

So the question is can staff/management not organise stock control or else once ordered walk to at least three locations within 200 yards to buy a bottle?

What a poor experience and a complete lack of initiative by management.",1,2017,04,27
213,Lovely Location,"Stayed for two nights, usually stay in the centre of Dublin when visiting but opted for a quieter break.  Very comfortable hotel in a really nice area had a lovely walk from the hotel into the centre.
Really could not fault the hotel my room was really comfortable, not much of a view as it overlooked apartments but I booked late and a lot of the rooms overlook the park so next time I would ask for one of those.  Nice Nespresso machine in the room and a comfortable sitting area where I could relax and enjoy a coffee.
Staff were really friendly, did not eat in the hotel as I was surrounded by an abundance of restaurants, cafes and bars which is a major plus to this hotel.  Had no problem spending a couple of days here just wish it could have been a couple more.
Will definitely be back.",4,2017,04,27
213,recommend,"Would highly recommend this hotel it is a little pricey .,the mini bar is expensive the prices are over the top,  the staff are wonderful and very pleasant,and the food is to die for  just loved my stay , I found the price of our room a little high and did not include breakfast, but overall very enjoyable 😉",5,2017,04,27
213,Excellent,"This hotel is top-notch when it comes to comfort, helpful and friendly staff, and excellent amenities all around. The bed and pillows were very comfortable.  Very clean and comfortable room. A charger was provided for electronic devices.  The breakfast buffet was very nice.  My only issue was a mildewy-smelling shower curtain, but that was promptly replaced.",5,2017,04,26
213,Beautiful Hotel.,"We enjoyed our stay at the Herbert Park and will definitely stay there again,. Breakfast was excellent and the Room Beautiful with a view over Herbert Park.  We also had a meal  and drinks in the Bar which was very good.",5,2017,04,26
213,Excellent,"Stayed one night for rugby game at Aviva. Excellent location , relaxed environment, quiet, large room. Parking,Good value overall.Staff were friendly and helpful. Like the restaurant overlooking the park. A little disappointed with the eggs Benedict  at breakfast, poor standard.",4,2017,04,25
213,Weekend away,"Herbert Park proved to be a very pleasant experience. Very clean an inviting, very organized and helpful staff. It adjoins a lovely park, ideal for a jog or a nice stroll. I guess the only negative aspect was the double bed, really two bed pushed together creating a hard raised rib in the middle, not conducive to cuddling! A small thing I suppose, except .........",5,2017,04,25
213,Very pleasant stay,"I have stayed at the Herbert Park Hotel a number of times and enjoy my stay each time.
Excellent hotel, great location, easy to access.  The hotel is close to a number of lovely restaurants and to excellent shopping facilities.",5,2017,04,24
213,Reunion week=end,"I found the hotel excellent if a little more expensive than I usually pay. Then again it was very comfortable and quiet. The cleanliness of both the bedroom and the en-suite was first rate. The staff were helpful and friendly.
If I have a quibble, it is that the shower gel and shampoo bottles were rather stingy for two people.

213,Just what we wanted!,"We were in Dublin for a 50 year reunion of College Graduates.  We needed somewhere safe, quiet in South Dublin (which I know well) with secure car parking: taxis are much better than driving in Dublin.  We were offered a ""Fabulous Package"" which included fizzy wine, free parking and bed and breakfast: great value!  Room was very good and bed very comfortable, breakfast excellent and all the staff superb. The Park with cherry blossom in flower is behind the Hotel and the Anglesea Rd area is the best place in Dublin to stay.  Hope to stay again for next reunion, but perfect for anyone who wants to go to the Aviva for Rugby.",5,2017,04,24
213,Great location and friendly staff,I've stayed at the Herbert Park many times while working in Dublin and find it a very reliable hotel in a location which works very well from a business and social point of view.

213,Great location and an affordable price,"Very handy to dublin centre, affordable price and friendly staff. Didn't try to the food but if the standard of accommodation is anything to go by I think it would worth a try.  Great value for money especially the location ",4,2017,04,24
213,Our favorite Dublin Hotel,"We have always enjoyed the experience of staying at this great hotel. The staff are always friendly and helpful the bar area is spacious and comfortable with great bar food. Rooms are big and very well appointed (bed a little hard for me). parking is easy with a good overnight rate. With Herbert Park on the doorstep, its lovely to take a stroll after breakfast. All the comforts equal to any Hotel in Dublin.",5,2017,04,24
213,Great Location,Stayed for 2 nights to attend a christening. The location is great with bars and restaurants very close to the hotel. The negatives were the cost of parking and breakfast on top of a quite expensive room. Room service was prompt and the food was excellent.  TV reception was poor. The room was very clean and the firm bed suited me but not my wife.,4,2017,04,24
213,"Three star hotel, five star staff","Incredibly friendly and helpful staff, easy access to public transit, good restaurants and pubs only a stone's throw away. Nespresso machine in room was wonderful. Beautiful park!

15 Euro for a very limited continental breakfast is outrageous. A two minute walk to a bistro around the corner will give you a better breakfast for half the price.
Bed was very hard and uncomfortable.
Bathroom light was a harsh fluorescent bulb that was noisy and flashed a lot.

Small issues, really, but NOT issues I would expect in a four star hotel. Got the room at a discounted rate on a booking site, and I would probably not book for full price.",4,2017,04,23
213,Great place,"Very nice

213,Excellent hotel!,"My friend and I stayed here for four days and had a very comfortable and enjoyable experience. The room was very well kept, the staff was EXTREMELY helpful in suggesting different sites to see/food to try/booking a taxi, etc. The hotel itself was very clean, and I liked that they had a small gym. My one concern was that breakfast was never included in the lobby. There is a small restaurant (expensive) where you can buy food. ",5,2017,04,20
213,Lovely Hotel Lovely Staff,Did my first solo trip to Ireland and stayed at the Herbert Park hotel the accommodations were lovely and the staff super helpful! I would recommend it to anyone. They helped book tours and told me the best places to visit and eat while there.,5,2017,04,19

213,Relaxed comfortable stay,"We were attending an event in the RDS and decided to stay in the hotel. From the moment we arrived in everyone was extremely helpful and polite. Dominic at the reception put a smile on our faces on check in, we felt welcome.

213,Ex hotel at the Park.,"I have stayed at Herbert Park Hotel a number of times because the location is most suitable for me. I have become very fond of the place, excellent rooms, friendly efficient staff, many of whom are there a number of years. Location of the hotel partically in the wonderful Herbert Park is a real bonus...with playgrounds, tennis courts, bowling, pitches and fabulous street food available on Sunday's. 
We would have preferred a choice of pillow but in fairness we didn't request one. 
Breakfast buffet was very good. We enjoyed our stay. ",5,2017,04,17
213,Hotel Stay,"Lovely peaceful hotel. Rooms are very clean and relaxing. Very quiet , beds are very good.

The staff are very polite friendly without being too much. loved the decor. A real treat definitely be back. ,5,2017,04,16
213,Ten out of Ten,"We are staying in the Herbert Park Hotel at the moment and had such an excellent experience in the restaurant tonight that we felt compelled to write a review. We invited some friends over for a drink and decided at the last minute to have dinner.  The table was sorted out immediately, the meal was excellent and the service was five star.  The Manager was attentive, friendly and highly professional. Whether you live in Dublin or are just visiting, this really is a gem / a real find.",5,2017,04,15
213,Good experience,"Greeted with a Bailey's welcoming drink, first time ever in all the hotels we have been to.   Very curtious and helpful staff.  Heating and A/C that actually works.  Only ate breakfast in dinning room, good variety and friendly staff.  A little expensive but compared to an IBIS but good value.",5,2017,04,15
213,Awesome service and atmosphere.,Awesome!!!!  Great start to our Ireland Island tour! The wee folks for the game was a treat too! Filled the lobby with shouts and laughter. It was great to meet the welcome staff Loved the spirit of staff too.,5,2017,04,14
213,Very nice hotel,My self and my partner stayed here for a concert in the 3arena. The hotel and staff are very nice and I couldn't fault anything only the hotel rooms are very dated spotlessly clean but dated. I would recommend this hotel as it's located in a very nice part of Dublin and the room itself was a very reasonable price. 4* but just about.,4,2017,04,14
213,Great Find!!,Booked this hotel for 3 nights with work. First time staying here and I have to say it was fantastic. Beautiful hotel and the staff was so friendly and helpful. Will definitely stay again. Great location and food in the hotel was really good. ,5,2017,04,14
213,Great Hotel,"I liked this hotel as it was in walking distance of City Center but was not in the middle of it.  It is a bit of a walk but I preferred it.  It was next to a nice little park and had some great places nearby.  Everyday they left us each a bottle of water which was GREAT!!!  The gym is extremely small but there is a rowing machine, treadmill, elliptical and bike and a place to fill your water bottle.",5,2017,04,13
213,Night away,Excellent location. Extremely professional and friendly staff. Rooms very clean. Great selection of freshly prepared food for breakfast. Would love to return again. 🔜 easy to get taxi to Dublin City Centre and easy to walk in too. ,5,2017,04,13
213,What you'd expect,"Standard Business Hotel. Food average but everything else great. Never had any issues here and would keep coming back. 24hr Room Service, staff helpful, amazingly comfortable King Beds! I'd recommend booking your own taxis in advance.",4,2017,04,13
213,Nice surprise,"We had to travel on short notice and our preferred Dublin hotels were already fully booked. While HPH was not our first choice we enjoyed our stay. The Hotel.com room only offer was very compelling... We had a concern over the ""corporate"" feel of the hotel, but we should not have worried. The hotel as a whole is very clean and while the room furniture could do with bit of a refresh, it was clean comfortable and those Nespresso machines are great. The wi-fi is good in the rooms as well as anywhere else. We found the staff efficient and non obstructive and at most cases very pleasant. Let me put it this way: the hotel does the core basics very well. Food wise we have tried only the breakfast (cooked), which was good enough for us to return every morning. There was even option for how you like your bacon pre-cooked: crispy (my choice) or less so (husband & child) ... Soy milk at the ready for those pesky soy cappuccinos.  To be frank one minor point would be that I would recommend the management would consider incl the pice of the cappuccino/latte in the breakfast  .. being charged EUR3 extra for that is a bit silly in my books, having said that I paid it all the same. Also, grab a coffee at launch and sample the caramel bites... simply wonderful.  

Taxi to the city is EUR10. The hotel backs up on a lovely park - great for nice walk or a jog. Plenty of good restaurants if you wish to stay locally. Overall, at the right price you will not be wishing for more if you were to chose HPH. I hope they maintain & built on the achieved. 

",5,2017,04,12
213,Great Hotel in Dublin!!,I loved this place.  It was classy and thoughtful.  The staff was friendly and helpful.  It was about a five minute drive/ can ride from the city center.  Clean and fresh room and bathroom.  It was reasonably priced.  They even had charge adapters in the room.  I would certainly stay here again.  Highly recommended. ,5,2017,04,12
213,Weekend break,"We have stayed before and have always been impressed by the standard of the hotel and rooms and were got a very good deal.
The location is great with plenty of bars and restaurants on your doorstep and a 10/15 walk into St Stephens Green.

213,Excellent!,"We stayed in Herbert Park Hotel for one night and everything was just great. We got upgraded for free to an executive suite. Staff was very friendly and nice, room was very cozy and beautiful. Loved it!",5,2017,04,12
213,A night stay after a concert,Very nice hotel lobby to sit and have dinner or relax. Food was delicious and room was spacious with a very big bed. However the room was far too hot and the temperature couldn't not be adjusted to a lower temperature. Shower/bath was quite basic and small. Staff were friendly and helpful. However it was a bit overpriced.,4,2017,04,11
213,Dublin Hotel,"Beautiful accommodations. Friendly, attentive staff. Wonderful breakfast was included in our stay. Herbert Park is right next door. Great for a stroll. Love the Nepresso machine in our room! There are a few bars/restaurants within a 5-minute walk with good food.",5,2017,04,11
213,Nice Hotel - Great Location,"I've had '4 Star' stays at this hotel and I've had '2 Star' stays at this hotel. The difference??? Make sure you know what 'size' room you're booking. Using the same booking code I've had full-sized rooms with excellent accommodations and I've also ended up in a room barely big enough to fit the bed and the overall inability to move around and store luggage, etc...

The hotel is in an excellent location. The breakfast and other food is high quality. 

",4,2017,04,11
213,Short stay at the Herbert Park,We have stayed here many times before and as always it was excellent. We love the Fabulous package. Breakfast was excellent and I had honey straight from the hive for the first time ever. Never tire of the Herbert Park.,5,2017,04,11
213,Excellent 5 star hotel,"This is a 5 star hotel. The room is very clean, big, and modern. I hardly heard noise inside my room that allowed me to sleep well.

213,Excellent Customer service!,Beautiful hotel decorated to high standard as is the customer service! Rooms were high quality and food was delicious! Staff were extremely attentive and helpful! Really enjoyed my stay! Highly recommend!!,5,2017,04,10
213,Conference hotel,"Attended a 2 day conference recently.

Arrived early from the airport and at 9am the reception staff were looking for a cleaned and ready room. After coffee and muffins in the lounge area a room was ready by 10.15. Most hotels would give a 'check in from 3pm' line, but these guys were the best.

Standard rooms were modern, spacious and comfortable, with en suite shower over bath, trouser press, room safe and free wifi

Breakfast was a choice of cooked hot, or continental with a wide buffet choice.  Conference lunches were served in the main restaurant, buffet again with good choices.

Coffee break hot drinks and nibbles were good too.

Taxi to the centre of Dublin is about 8-10 Euro, and a taxi to the airport is 30-40 Euro depending on traffic",4,2017,04,10
213,Lovely short weekend stay in Dublin,"This hotel has a good price/value range and is good located.

213,Pleasant stay at excellent location,"Good size rooms, excellent location, free car parking, very clean, good service. very accessible for Ballsbridge & south city centre, lovely park beside hotel, large relaxing lobby, would recommend the bar area is screened off from the entranc/check in area  - bit expensive",5,2017,04,10
213,Ireland v England Six Nations,"Lovely staff on reception when we arrived. Confusion over our bookings, but all sorted by the staff. 
The rooms were good, and quite roomy. Very clean also and had everything we needed for the two hours that we spent in them! 
My only complaint was that on the last night, after the rugby, we returned to the hotel just before midnight, and were all hungry. The restaurant was closed, but we were told we could order food from room service. Well, no-one wanted to miss out on the craic downstairs in the lounge bar! We asked for the number of a pizza delivery company.  My son was told by the gentleman on night reception that we couldn't eat pizza in the lobby - ""not one slice!' My husband and son remonstrated with him when the pizza arrived, and he stood in front of them with his arms outstretched, like Jesus at Bethsaida, blocking their passage with the food to the lounge. But whereas Jesus shared 5 loaves and 2 fish with a cast of 5000, this Grumpy Gateman would not let us be fed, nor share our offerings with the poor defeated English fans! I was rather incensed! My husband and son took the four pizzas to our room and then told us to follow. Having paid 320Euro for each room for that night, I was determined to eat our pizza in the lobby! So I brought the four pizzas down in my cabin bag! I ate one slice of pizza in defiance in the lobby, and then got too scared of the Grumpy Gateman and went back upstairs! So he was a bit of a buzz kill, but we still enjoyed the weekend. Tom Hiddleston has nothing to fear!",3,2017,04,08
213,3 day Conference at Herbert,"A good experience overall. It was my first time in Dublin and Herbert Hotel made this a memorable one. I found the hotel to be well rounded, perfectly located and well suitable for business events. The in room service, and hospitality was great. ",4,2017,04,08
213,Business stay,"Stayed here for 2 nights on a business trip and was really impressed with the great attitude and helpfulness of the staff. They were all lovely.  The rooms were large, light and comfortable. Had breakfast in the hotel and at €20 euros do feel there could have been a better selection but it was pretty average for a hotel. There are lots of nice pubs and places to eat around the hotel and it's situated next to a nice park. Would stay here again.",4,2017,04,08
213,Two nice nights in Dublin,"Was in Dublin for business earlier this week and returned to the Herbert Park Hotel.    Was my 3rd visit and just like the prior two it was very nice.    The staff is consistently friendly and helpful, the rooms are clean and spacious.    I don't spend much time in the room, but it is well appointed and I always sleep well.    It is my only choice when I come to Dublin",5,2017,04,07
213,Pavilion restaurant - Beware the fixed-price expensive lunch!,"Had lunch for 2 today at the Pavilion Restaurant.  We only each wanted a main course. Waitress misunderstood & brought us 2 starters instead (mine was excellent).  Then the boss came over & said our main courses were coming. We said we didn't want them but he said the starters were on the house because of the mixup. Main courses came, tasted good (neither of us really wanted them but we ate them.)

They offered us desserts - which we couldn't eat having wanted one course & already been served two! The boss explained that the meal was a fixed price for 2 courses. Ended up paying €25 each for what would have been 2 main courses. Nice food, but lesson learned.  Disappointed in their inflexibility.",3,2017,04,07

213,Good place,It's nice hotel to stay but pricy. However one slight problem I had the room was beside next room bathroom. So I woke up with the noise which was disturbing. Rest is all good. Food is good too but their scramble eggs are not good.,3,2017,04,03
213,"Really comfortable room, Great staff","Single room - so not huge, but very clean, quiet and comfortable. Bathroom was lovely. Staff were all fantastic - helpful and friendly.

213,Top Class Hotel Experience - A Mother & Son Trip to Dublin.,"Most enjoyable visit to the Herbert Part Hotel. My son and I travelled from the south west. We were in Dublin for the Feis-Ceoil at the RDS so the Herbert Park Hotel was an ideal location to stay. The Rooms were keenly priced and similar to many hotels in the area and much more affordable than some primary branded hotels around Dublin. The Hotel experience was truly magnificent and far superior to our experience in other Hotels. The staff act as a team and you can tell the ethos focus is on customer service with a personal touch There was absolutely no issue what so ever with any aspect our stay at the Herbert Park Hotel. We arrived on Sat Apr 1st and stayed overnight. The ambiance was fresh & clean, very-relaxing and the staff were wonderful and accommodating on any requirement – they were very welcoming and very hospitable and engaging. Exceptional Staff customer service for a Hotel. The food was gorgeous and the ambiance at the restaurant was superb also. Really enjoyed the Sunday Breakfast spread too. Set us up for the day. The Room was lovely and we were fortunate to have a panoramic view of Herbert Park. The Leinster Rugby Game added an atmosphere and the crowd in the Hotel Lobby were in great form and well behaved.

213,"A great hotel with excellent, friendly staff.","We stayed at the Herbert Park Hotel as a base for a weekend away  - part of which was to watch a rugby game at the Aviva stadium. The location for that is perfect - just a 10 minute walk.
We arrived mid morning, and were delighted that the 4 rooms we had booked were all available, and we could move in straight away. A nice touch was the tot of Baileys or whiskey, and home made cupcakes we were offered!
As well as being convenient for the rugby, the hotel is located next to a nice park, and there are several restaurants nearby, and some great pubs with a good friendly atmosphere - and music, 
The hotel public areas and rooms were spotless, and all facilities were top notch. All the hotel staff were helpful and friendly - we will definitely book in to Herbert Park again next time we go to Dublin.",5,2017,04,03
213,Very good in every way,Convenient. Clean. Helpful staff. Address and location could be clearer on website - better map and use of postcode. Good breakfast including croissants and fresh honey. Appears to be very popular which is good sign. Bed linen could be better quality.,5,2017,04,03
213,Contented Foodie,Enjoyed breakfast the most - there were rollmops herring with pickled gherkins and smoked salmon. Pastries were kept warm and crispy. Love the Nespresso machine in the room. 1 min walk to Lobster Pot!,4,2017,04,02
213,Amazing Hotel,"Have to say this is an amazing hotel, great rooms, could do with updating a little, but huge beds... friendly staff and amazing food in restaurant.. Opted for the Sirlion Steak, utterly devine with french fires and peppercorn sauce to die for",5,2017,04,01
213,Herbert Park Stay,"The hotel was convenient and we've used it before.  The stay was great, beds are comfortable, and they have a good shower.  We accidentally left a whole bunch of stuff, including some money in the room.  They called me to tell me that this was left before I even realized I had forgotten it.  Well done HPH.
",5,2017,04,01
213,Stay with Herbert,"I love the friendliness of the staff and their willingness to go the extra mile, particularly the reception and front desk staff.  The hotel is within walking distance to the centre of Dublin and other areas such as Ranelagh and Donnybrook with their excellent restaurants to say nothing of the park behind the hotel.  The rooms are always clean and cared for.  An excellent hotel for a few days business or leisure. ",4,2017,03,31
213,herbert park stay march 2017,"hotel room , staff , location all great . Ideal for business stays in the south Dublin area ,rugby weekends and events in the RDS. Evening parking in the area is plus all so . Good pubs and eating places near by.",4,2017,03,31
213,Lovely hotel but a pity about the single beds,Really friendly staff and lovely atmosphere in the hotel. Having the park beside it is a great bonus if you have some down time. Unfortunately I got a room with three single beds and single duvets. I stay in a lot of hotels and didn't think anywhere other than travel lodges still had rooms like this! Not exactly worth the money because of this and a bad nights sleep.,4,2017,03,31
213,Great package,"Herbert Park is a great location when travelling from the South East. The service is professional, and subtle, always excellent and understated. Great rooms, from the standard up to excellent suites. Great service and nothing is ever a problem. And if there ever is a problem, it is addressed immediately. ",4,2017,03,30

213,Convenient location,"Great location for most business or tourist attractions, main bus routes, rail,walking distance to most sites makes this hotel ideal. Breakfast is average if you don't mind hot food lying in hot plates for long periods. Freshly cooked for the money your paying should be the norm. My room 212 though lovely had constant water noise through the night, very annoying. Manager take note.",4,2017,03,29
213,Overnight Stay.,"We stayed here for one night. Staff in all areas from reception to servers and bar staff in the terrace bar  were very friendly and helpful. Special mention for the young man who checked us in ..it was his first day on the job He was very polite and had a lovely manner. The room was very good and clean. Very comfortable bed. Breakfast was amazing, though way too much food. We could have shared one- and you could order  it on room service until 4 am. Location was perfect for us as we were attending Ireland V Wales soccer match at Aviva stadium. ",5,2017,03,29
213,Hotel stay,"Business trip, excellent location. Staff very friendly.  Poor departure as tried to charge me for drinks not only I didn't have but I had not even booked in the hotel, staff were rude at times when dealing with this concern.  Food was expensive.  ",3,2017,03,29
213,Great hotel with wonderful staff,"Really enjoyed our stay here, location was amazing as we were going to watch Ireland v Wales at the Aviva Stadium.

Thank you ",5,2017,03,29
213,My favorite business hotel in Dublin,Everything about this hotel is just right for the business traveler in Dublin.  I have also stayed here with my family too.  The rooms are quiet and comfortable.  The breakfast is great.  Lobby service is excellent if you want to meet clients for a drink and an informal meeting.  The food is also very good in the restaurants.  And it is a nice walk into the city centre if you want to experience the lovely south city.,5,2017,03,28
213,Herbert Park Hotel,The staff was very helpful with recommendations around the city. The hotel was very clean and the food was excellent. I had a very enjoyable stay due to the location and warm welcoming help of the staff. ,5,2017,03,28
213,Grand Slam on tour,We received a very pleasant welcome at reception and from that moment on all of the staff were fantastic - they could not have been more friendly and efficient. The hotel was very high spec and we will return one day.,5,2017,03,28
213,Great location ,Used the hotel through work. It was wonderful. The staff were friendly. The rooms were huge and spacious and my view was great. The breakfast in the morning was delicious and had a great selection for veggies like myself. Checkout was midday which was refreshing from the usual 10/11 am. Fab location for the local area and rds. Only a few euro to the cart centre in bus or taxi. Would come back again ,5,2017,03,27
213,"Excellent accommodations, with superior customer service","The customer service that I received from David and Dominic at the front desk certainly exceeded my expectations. 
They were friendly, knowledgeable, and very helpful with a shipping issue of mine, and they followed up with me diligently.
Your hotel is lovely, but I will return mostly due to those 2 gentlemen.
Thank you!",5,2017,03,27
213,Dublin Delight,This hotel was excellent. Clean & tidy rooms with great facilities and pleasant staff. The dining room looking over Herbert Park was particularly nice. I would recommend a stay here anytime and a perfect location if you are going to the Aviva or RDS. ,5,2017,03,27
213,First rate experience,"The Herbert Park is not a ""grand"" or ""splendid"" hotel -- but it is a truly wonderful place in which to stay. It's clean-lined, has a modern elegance and gracefulness, and a range of amenities (including free internet access). The rooms are really comfortable, scrupulously clean and very well maintained. Our bed was vast and welcoming each evening. The staff are amazing: Lara, Ioana and Dominic at the front desk were more like friends and personal assistants than front desk staff. They gave advice, were tolerant of endless questions, made bookings and called cabs for us -- and were always smiling! And, most importantly, warm and considerate. Much the same applies to Dharam and Peter at the bar. The hotel is also very well located, within walking distance ( 5 to 6 minutes) of at least ten restaurants/bars and -- importantly -- it backs onto Herbert Park, which is s wonderful place through which to walk and relax. We'd stay at the Herbert whenever in Dublin.",5,2017,03,27
213,Would highly recommend!!!,"Incredible spacious rooms, ours had a view of the park. We loved the small touches, magazines on the table, a small box of butlers chocolates beside the bed, fruit basket on arrival, a nespresso coffee machine in the room. The room was so quiet, not a sound to be heard from another room. When we opened the windows, we could hear the birds singing in the park. They had blackout blinds which were controlled by a switch, and even though the location is so central, you still feel like you're in the countryside. The staff were so accommodating, willing to go above and beyond to make our stay perfect. Breakfast was fantastic too, full of variety. We will definitely be back. Would highly recommend this place. ",5,2017,03,27
213,Very pleasant stay!,"Friendly and helpful staff! Clean, comfortable and quite large rooms. Warm welcome, great food (breakfast/lunch), appropriate pricing. Decided to stay at this particular hotel when attending a workshop at the same location. All in all, very satisfied!",5,2017,03,27
213,Fantastic hotel - would certainly stay again and reccomend,"Super hotel, very comfortable - one of the best I've stayed at. Comfortable bed and bath, all spotless and quiet. Sad I could only stay for one night! Would have loved to make more use of the lovely room.",5,2017,03,27
213,Great hotel in Dublin,"This was our first stop in Ireland. Great hotel, great staff, great good. You will not be disappointed. Great location. Near the soccer stadium. Right by the American Embassy. Comfy bed, nice bathroom accommodations.",5,2017,03,27
213,Herbert Park visit,Had an overnight in Herbert Park hotel last week.  It was excellent.  Staff were super nice and the room was perfect.  Ordered breakfast to the room.  While it arrived on time it was a bit cold but mostly very good. Would recommend this hotel if visiting Dublin as an excellent Base. ,4,2017,03,26
213,Great ,Very nice place. Good helpful staff. Easy access to the RDS aswell. We'd definitely recommend it. Food in the restaurant is very nice and the waiters and waitresses are very helpful. Overall the Herbert Park Hotel is a very good place to visit,5,2017,03,26
213,Enjoyable visit on business,"I found the room very spacious, spotlessly clean, and quiet. The bed was to my taste, medium firm and extremely comfortable. Breakfast gave a good choice. All the staff I spoke to were well mannered aand could not have been more helpful.",5,2017,03,25
213,Expectations met and exceeded,"I was in Dublin for a short business stay and the HP Hotel was conveniently located.  While there is strong competition in the area, I couldn't be happier with my choice.  It was very clean, super friendly staff, good food, nice social bar and coffee site....good value for the price paid.",5,2017,03,24
213,Hidden Gem,"Recently we were completing our tour of the Republic of Ireland and wanted to extend our tour by several days to explore Dublin but wanted to be able to take advantage of the Dublin Hop on Hop Off tour bus and hopeful that we could find a location close enough but be away from all the noise and traffic.  The Herbert Park Hotel exceeded those needs.  Less than a block away to city bus service which will take you to Merron Square which you can catch the Hop on Hop Off bus on it's fourth stop which is National Museum and Wilde Memorial.  We were clueless but we the approached front desk and spoke with Davide and he was more than gracious to provide us with the information we needed and it was a smooth transition to and from the hotel. He also was kind enough to provide us the change we would need to catch the city bus because you need exact change which was is 2 euros both directions. Thank you Davide for also calling to make arrangements for our taxi service to the airport. We also had the opportunity to speak with Tara at the front desk.  Thank you Tara for your assistance. This hotel is spotless, rooms are clean, beds comfortable they really pay attention to details.  We also had the opportunity to have breakfast and you won't be disappointed by the selection of buffet style, thank you Candy for your attention and concern that we had everything that we needed and you can't find a quietier atmosphere while you look out on Herbert Park and watch individuals walking their dogs and dogs playing, Truly a great ending to our fairytale trip to the Republic of Ireland.  Thanks to all!",5,2017,03,24
213,Pre Rugby meal,"We had a light meal here a few weeks back before the Leinster -v- Scarlets rugby match in the RDS. The atmosphere was great, the price was very reasonable, and the staff - our watress was Dagmara - we're very helpful. In fact when asked they even suggested something that would be ready in time for us to make the kick-off. Hightly recommended.",5,2017,03,23
213,St Patricks weekend celebrations and England v Ireland Rugby,"First time my wife and I have stayed at the Herbert Park but it wont be the last. A good mile and a half  from the manic hustle and bustle of Temple Bar or Grafton St but for us it was perfectly situated in a quiet road bordering a lovely park ... and barely 15mins walk to the Aviva Stadium.  Modern but attractive light and airy hotel with all amenities you might want for a short stay. The room we had was impeccably clean, smart and surprisingly spacious. Breakfast catered for all tastes and appetites. We had one dinner in the hotel restaurant which was excellent. Best of all was the consistently warm and delightful service from the moment we arrived to the moment we left. Not a false note over three days and nights. All in all a very good experience.",5,2017,03,23
213,The perfect Dublin staycation venue,"We had the pleasure of spending the Paddy's Day and Ire v Eng six nations weekend based out of The Herbert Park Hotel.  From the moment we arrived at the hotel and were warmly greeted by the reception staff, until we we're similarly warmly thanked for our custom upon departure 48 hrs later, a great time was had.  The hotel, its Ballsbridge situation on the park and its staff are very relaxed in style and the open plan design of the entrance foyer, leading through to the bar area with an array of comfortable seating, is a delightful space to spend time just being, or socialising with friends and other guests.  The rooms are very comfortable, spotless and highly functional.  Give it a try, you'll find it ideal in all aspects.",5,2017,03,23
213,St Patrick's weekend,My daughter and I had a great experience in the Park View Suite. Egle and Dominic were very warm upon our arrival early Friday morning. We would stay again for sure. We enjoyed breakfast and lunch at the property.,5,2017,03,22
213,Appalling night sleep,"Stayed at the Herbert Park hotel in March.  Tiny single room but last one left on booking.com.  Reception area nice but guys running the bar were very slow and not very attentive which was embarrassing when entertaining guests.   

Main problem with my stay was the sleep quality.  Woken at 3:30am with what sounded like a particularly loud pump clearing water.  It wasn't the air con as that was already switched off.  If that wasn't bad enough, my room on the first floor was clearly directly beneath the bathroom area of the room above as I found out when the person staying in that room decided to have a shower at 5:30 in the morning.  

I mentioned this to reception when I checked out saying I was none too pleased to get such an awful night's sleep. The said ""to make up well offer you a front facing room next time you come back""...  not sure that's going to be any time soon..

Book elsewhere. There's cheaper and better and a hotel who gets the concept of customer service.

213,Hebert Park hotel last stop on vacation!,"Accommodations were great!  About a 15 minute walk to Book of Kells and other historical locations. Staff very friendly and helpful.  Restaraunt was clean,  bright,  and spacious with a nice morning buffet. ",5,2017,03,22
213,Herbert Park Hotel,"This was my favorite hotel during my recent CIE tour.  Everone was very friendly and helpful.  Lara at the front desk is awesome and went above and beyond to deal with a lost travel voucher.  I would definitely recommend the Herbert Park.
",5,2017,03,22
213,wonderful staff great location nice rooms,"Staff was the best ever.  Went to various cities in Ireland; however, I think the staff at Herbert  Park was the best of all the hotels we stayed at. I was with a tour group and decided to stay a few more days in Dublin.  I decided to stay at the Herbert and don't regret it at all.  Highly recommend!    ",5,2017,03,22
213,Paddy's Day weekend at The Herbert Park Hotel,"We arrived on March 16 to be greeted by the Asst. General Manager who welcomed us with a shamrock cup cake and a shot of Irish whisky .

213,Outstanding- will definatley be back!!!!,"We stayed here during the 6 nations Ireland v England and were so well looked after.

From the moment we walked in we were so warmly welcomed by the fabulous Lara who made our stay perfect.

The rooms were exceptional, bright, clean and comfortable.

All services easily charged to the room with no errors at the end.

We added breakfast, and wow what a spread. the Monday morning the filling of the hot food for the buffet was slow but this can be forgiven as the staff had been working their socks off all weekend!

The hotel was packed during the rugby so if not a rugby fan then best to avoid although as guests of the hotel we never went without.

Taxis, Maps, local info can always be sourced from the reception.

room cost was more than I would usually spend but for the luxury would go back in a heartbeat!!!",5,2017,03,20
213,6 Nations weekend,"Excellent hotel, superb location. The staff were very helpful arranging transport from the hotel into the centre of Dublin.

213,Hanekom short stay,I was booked into hotel by Ireland Enterprises whom hosted an investment conference in Irish Agriculture. The stay was unfortunately short  - but what impressed though was the fast effective service and the first class facilities of the hotel. The ambience is catching and the location central and convenient. ,4,2017,03,19
213,A big thank you,"Thank you to the staff on duty Saturday night / Sunday morning, my husband was taken poorly in the early hours and I needed the hotels emergency assistance, they called an ambulance and stayed with us while waiting with nothing too much trouble. Thankfully all is good, but we truly appreciate all the help we received.",5,2017,03,19
213,Dreadful,"We met friends staying in the hotel after the Ireland vs England rugby match. The bar staff were not interested in customer service.  I understand it was late and non residents could not be served but the dismissive attitude was dreadful. I often come to Dublin and if this is how they treat clients I will never stay in this hotel nor recommend others. First impressions are key, a great disappointment.",1,2017,03,18
213,Very good hotel and staff,I stayed in the Herbert Park Hotel in January and again in March 2017.

213,Rugby!,"I booked the Herbert for myself and Friends so we could stay in Dublin to watch the rugby. I found the staff to be helpful and friendly, but not in that sycophantic, sucking up  kind of why which is often the case in the more expensive hotels. The rooms were of a high standard and when we returned there was a small tray of hand mad made chocolates and macarons waiting for us. be warned however drinks are not even approaching a reasonable price, two 16 year old bushmills €36.00!",5,2017,03,12

More importantly staff was wonderful, after one day we were treated like gold!  Dhoram was especially attentive even remembering what bottle of wine we liked!

Also helpful staff for getting around and not having to be ""tourist"" tours but just learn the city how we like--by walking and taxi to different spots.  If you like to walk, a great nature area behind and nice walk to shopping and great pubs!

Also when we had a 5 am wake up we had breakfast waiting on silver tray and taxi all called and made it absolutely a great place to stay.",5,2017,03,01

PROS: 
- It is walking distance to downtown (unless you don't like walking at all)
- We had a big room with lots of natural light
- Decoration is beautiful, in the rooms and the rest of the hotel: elegant and simple, so relaxing...
- The room had complimentary bottled water every day and Nespresso coffee machine with enough coffee capsules, also complimentary, so good!
- Wifi is free in the rooms and the rest of the hotel.
- Breakfast has not a huge offer but it is great quality: you can chose several hot dishes that will be cooked just for you, they have a delicious strawberry smoothy, they have pure non-processed honey (delicatessen), smoked salmon...
- You can have also breakfast in your room (6,5€ service delivery charge)
- We also enjoyed the room service for dinner and it was very fast and good.
- The staff were helpful and kind.
CONS
- Parking is not free of charge. We didn't care because we didn't have a car, but it may be important for some customers.

213,An OK hotel if you can't find anything more central,"We booked the Herbert Park as part of a weekend away. The hotel is not located in the centre of Dublin but is a 15 minute bus/car ride away form town. The public areas are new and very airy. The rooms however are drab and identikit, standard hotel style. Our room was clean and functional. Not somewhere I would stay again by choice as we spent so much time on buses or taxis and if you are not a rugby fan then avoid it on days when there is a big match on as it gets very busy in the public areas.",3,2017,02,27
213,Great People,"Always a great experience at this hotel, believe me these are great people.

213,Amazing staff!!,"One thing that captured my attention is the amazing staff at this hotel, truly the level of customer service is outstanding. Ieona on reception in particular, couldn't do enough to make sure I had a pleasant stay. 

Room is well sized and comfortable. I liked the Nespresso machine - once I got it working as it wasn't the easiest despite the instructions however the coffee was lovely and well needed after an early flight. I slept right through Storm Doris and didn't hear a thing. 

Dinner was interesting, I ordered a lite meal but the portions was still quite big! I ordered the lasagne and personally didn't enjoy it as there was too much going on with added vegetables. Breakfast on the other land was lovely, good selection and you can also order fresh items such as eggs benedict included within the Irish breakfast rate.

Hotel is within a few minutes walk of the RDS and there's a walkway that takes you directly there. ",5,2017,02,26

213,Car parking an issue,"This hotel is lovely, although actually getting to it requires a bit of detective work as the entrance is very narrow - I had to drive around the block a second time before I found it. Then I discovered that I had parked out the front, but those spaces are not for the hotel!!! In fairness, one of the porters accompanied me as I went from the front of the hotel to the car park.

Lovely room and really fabulous breakfast. However, streaky rashers was an unexpected economy and although I checked out in person, and paid my bill, including parking, the receptionist failed to validate my car parking ticket.

I was really, really   annoyed when I got to the barrier, to discover that I needed to go back to reception ",3,2017,02,24

213,Excellent bar lunch,"We had a really excellent family bar lunch here- the service was excellent and careful. A very good menu selection. Great bread and soup which was not too rich or creamy. Main courses looked excellent. The desserts were very generous. The only quibble is the hotel's car parking charges which are outrageous, and a real deterrent. The food is not cheap- it makes for a very expensive visit if you pay between 9 &12 Euro on top.",4,2017,02,20
213,very professional staff,"Every single employee was very polite and professional. 
I had a room temperature issue, in which i couldn't get the temperature down with the airco or open window, but the staff had that fixed in less than 2 hours.
It's possible to order anything on or off the menu (within reason), without an added charge over the normal breakfast price.
There were taxis waiting outside the hotel, the lounge was spotless, the restaurant was spotless and the staff was polite. ",5,2017,02,20

213,"Nice hotel, great staff","Generally enjoy staying here, but reservation and check in process needs improving. Despite being a reat customer I get asked for all the same details each time with a promise that they are now recorded. After a long journey it can be very frustrating. Other than that the hotel delivers a great product",4,2017,02,13
213,"Lovely hotel, location great","Excellent hotel, handy car-park but you have to pay for it,  location is really good for Bord Gáis Energy Theatre,  Lobby is a good size as they do not have a closed door bar, TV's scattered around for games, relaxing.  Stayed a few times over the years and always a good high standard.  No complaints ever.  ",5,2017,02,13
213,Matte Finish on my Turtle Shell,"Accommodations were above average in almost every respect.

213,Weekend in the Herbert Park  ,Great weekend at the Herbert Park Hotel. Staff and hotel accommodation brilliant. Prosecco in the room included in the deal. Lovely rooms great views over the park. Great breakfast. Walking distance to Dublin city centre or nearby taxis available    Never disappoints. ,5,2017,02,12
213,Average Experience,"No ironing equipment available in the rooms. The breakfast had all the typical foods available but eggs on both days were not fully cooked and mushrooms were from a tin not fresh, just observations but at €19.50 for a breakfast I did expect fresh high quality foods to be served. All the staff were great :)",3,2017,02,12
213,"Overall excellent, but not great for veggies.","This is a very pleasant and friendly hotel. Good sized room with a full sized bath - a rarity these days. The espresso machine in the room is a brilliant and much appreciated addition.

My only niggle is the vegetarian menu. Goat's cheese brulée starter was fine, but the only main choice was risotto, which was uninteresting and stodgy. Cater properly for us vegetablists and you'll tick every box!",4,2017,02,12
213,Excellent service and friendly staff as always!,Fantastic hotel overlooking the Herbert Park. Very high standard in every department and staff are as professional friendly and helpful as you will encounter anywhere! Underground car parking a bonus.,5,2017,02,10

Down town a 20 min taxi trip so all round lots to do .,5,2017,02,10
213,Trying to be better,"I have stayed here frequently, and recently I have asked why I do. This recent stay was by far not up to previous standards. The staff seem to be trying to hard to be friendly and professional. It doesn't feel authentic. Also this time round the breakfast buffet wasn't ready, service was mediocre, with very little interaction from the staff. They just don't seem to pay attention to what is going on around them. The hotel is trying to be a 5 star, but it feels like a 3. ",3,2017,02,10
213,Great hotel!,"Delicious food, beautiful view...cozy atmosphere. Everyone seems really happy to be working there, they were all very welcoming, kind and gentle. My luggage was missing at the airport so the reception team helped me a lot with this, they even lend me a phone charger. Hope to come back soon!!! ",5,2017,02,09
213,Reception Staff,"The reception staff at check in (Friday night) were far superior to the check out staff (Sunday morning)
The check out staff were extremely slow and not particularly pleasant. They could learn to interact with people while processing the departure. ",4,2017,02,07
213,Great location near Royal Dublin Society and bus lines,"The hotel was very close to the Royal Dublin Society, the reason we were visiting the area. There were several restaurants nearby (Thai, Indian, pizza, Subway, pubs). Additionally, it was just a couple blocks to the bus stops that go downtown to the museums.

The staff at the front desk was very helpful with maps and directions (thanks to Davide, in particular!).",5,2017,02,07

213,Great Business Hotel Spot in Ballsbridge,"Arriving to Herbert Park was heavenly after a long international flight. The check-in was easy and clear. I loved the front desk staff throughout my stay, very delightful! They booked a taxi a few times for me and gave excellent advice for dining nearby. 

The room it self was large and very accommodating for myself. Complete with a mini fridge and hairdryer. Other hotels in Dublin and Ireland I have had problems stepping in and out of the shower as they are more raised, but the Herbert Park bathtub was a great height to not have to worry too much. Though I had business literature and other stuff around the room, the cleaning crew kept my space very clean and I was thankful for their consistency to keeping my stuff organized. 

The bar is nice size, with great light during the day. And the breakfast was delightful! Definitely worth the extra fee, it's a huge buffet with anything you could imagine, loved that they had smoothies each day. 

Nice restaurants around, whatever your budget or time frame. Plus a quick cab ride to Dublin City Center. Or if you want a quick (ish) lunch the restaurant in the hotel had lovely options as well. 

Overall an awesome staff and great location and stay. Hope to return soon!",4,2017,02,06
213,helpful staff,"The hotel staff, especially Joann, was very helpful and patient(!) helping us to choose the best public transportation option to different day trip destinations around the country.

213,MrDev,"Very good hotel. Friendly staff, very clean/modern rooms and breakfast variety was excellent. The location is great as it is on the outskirt of the main city centre but not too far.

213,"Great location, staff and service but ...","I stayed in this hotel last Friday taking both a twin and double room.  The double was an upgrade to an executive room which was hugely appreciated.  The only difference that we could see was that we were on the corner of the building with a great view out over Herbert Park - otherwise standard.

The Herbert Park is in an ideal location in Ballsbridge and perfect for both business and leisure visitor.  With a large choice of pubs and restaurants within walking distance this is one of the best spots in the city.  Service by the staff was excellent and overall we were very happy with out visit.

Our only 'but' was that the room we stayed like the others are getting tired and a program of refurbishment seems overdue.  Also we found the corner room with its large amount of windows quite drafty and kept looking to see if a window was open.  

Overall - this would not put me off staying here because I love the location.  The nearly Herbert Park if a beautiful public space.

Would recommend but please .. time to invest.",4,2017,01,30

213,Nice stay in Dublin!,"The public areas of the hotel have all been updated and are great, especially the lobby bar and the main dining room which has a wonderful view of the park.  The rooms look dated and could use a refresh, but they are quite and comfortable with a lot of space.",4,2017,01,27
213,"Excellent staff, great location, comfortable room","The stay was exceptional, from the efficient and helpful front desk staff to the comfortable and well-equipped room to the delicious breakfast buffet.  The location is convenient to city center via short taxi, easy bus access or an invigorating walk.",5,2017,01,27
213,short stay,"a nice, quire modern hotel with a comfortable bed, spacious rooms, good breakfast in a restaurant with a beautiful wiev of the park and a friendly staff... All that is needed for short stay and they have it.",4,2017,01,27
213,Do not accept a room at rear of hotel,"I like this hotel, the staff are friendly, the service is good and the overall condition of hotel is excellent. I have travelled here several times. On this occasion I was placed at the rear of the hotel where a building is being demolished less than 10 feet from the hotel - noise was a major problem. I would still stay here but make sure you get a room at front or you will be disappointed- rooms are not cheap and they should either discount the rooms or at least advise their guests so we have a choice. Enjoy the snapshot from my bedroom window and imagine the noise.",2,2017,01,27
213,Felt spolit!,"This is a lovely hotel with a calming atmosphere, helpful and friendly staff, spotless spacious and comfortable rooms.  Food was good value for money although drinks are expensive. Would definitely want to stay here again when next in Dublin.",5,2017,01,27
213,Superb,"I used to stay in this hotel on regular basis few years back when on business trips in Dublin. Return was a delight. Rooms are refurbished, clean and spacious. Staff couldn't be more helpful and the food was top class! Gym is quiet small but it has all the basics. Location is perfect with Herbert Park on the door step. Marijan the doorman loves his job. Looking forward to staying here again. ",5,2017,01,26
213,PaulaLevins ,"It's a fabulous hotel. I was staying for a shopping trip with my daughter, we got a quiet, clean spacious room with a beautiful view over the Herbert Park. In the morning I made a cup of espresso coffee and sat to watch the swans in the pond from my room. Staff were very helpful, especially Reception team. Great breakfast, secure parking, great Bar food. Exactly what we were looking for. We will be back.",5,2017,01,26
213,very underwhelming,"Booked an executive room, the room was smaller than most standard hotel rooms.
The only difference was a jacuzzi bath and bath robes. 
Plumbing noises throughout the night also.
Breakfast in bed was a positive of the stay.",1,2017,01,25
213,A bit older style of hotel ,"It's a very nice and clean room. It feels a bit old fashioned. Good size room and the option of eating in the restaurant or at the bar.
The food in the restaurant is good, and very friendly staff.
I really miss a good gym, but there is one nearby. The fitness room isn't great.",4,2017,01,25
213,Stressful Event,"Although the hotel itself is beautiful and conveniently located planning an event I held here was a nightmare. When a confusion arose with my booking prior to my event the staff were unapologetic and unhelpful. On the day of the event small requests such as more cups for tea & coffee seemed like the biggest request in the world, the staff were not attentive and I spent most of my event chasing the staff to clear up food and drink on the refreshments table which was constantly a mess or ask for more tea and coffee which despite me continually asking took an age to replenish. The staff overall made the event a stressful and frustrating one.",2,2017,01,25
213,Enjoyed dinner here...,"Had a lovely dinner here with my colleagues, really great service and the food is absolutely fantastic and really enjoyable. It would have been lovely to have some background music in the food/bar area, nothing too much - maybe some classical music. A really lovely experience, would recommend it.",4,2017,01,24
213,Another Enterprise Ireland visit to purchase clothing and woollens from Ireland,"A good vsit to Dublin whereby we were able, again, to purchase Irish clothing for marketing in Germany.
The open restaurant seating was not quite claen in the area we were sitting - ford rest in the upholstery.",5,2017,01,24
213,Cosy Stay!,As always it was a most enjoyable stay with the best Hotel Breakfast we have experienced. The Staff looked after us in a quiet efficient manner with nothing too much trouble. It was a walk in the park!,5,2017,01,23
213,Failing in the basics...,"The room was clean and tidy and I could smell fresh-ish paint (good sign!).  However, the mattress was really hard, the duvet heavy/leaden and my pillow was a cheap foam one.  All topped off by air conditioning that only pumped out hot air. ",2,2017,01,23
213,William,We have stayed at the Herbert Park in the past and have always found it to be of a very good standard. Rooms comfortable and well equipped . Breakfast always good and all hotel staff are more than helpful. Good place to stay in Dublin.,4,2017,01,23
213,Great hotel ...,"We have stayed at the Herbert Park a few times before and it is consistently good. The rooms are pleasant and the breakfast is very good.  The bar is comfortable and lovely for a coffee, aperitif or night cap.  Ballsbridge is a lovely area, there are lots of restaurants close to the hotel and it is just round the corner from the Aviva Stadium if you're in Dublin for the rugby. We take the short bus ride into the centre of Dublin but you could walk if you're feeling energetic! ",5,2017,01,22
213,Fabulous,"Everyone was so helpful and caring

The Parkview Suite is special and want it every time I come to Dublin which will be very often

I have travelled around the world and I have very high standards and The Herbert Park Hotel exceeds my expectations

213,Best located next to a Park,"Nice room, a bit too expensive, breakfast ok, Nespresso machine in the room and easy to handle. Negative: tv channel only local and no French or german tv channels available. Gym average but overall a good Hotel",5,2017,01,20
213,Herbert Park Hotel,The staff at this hotel was very helpful and friendly.  The room was clean and spacious. The Herbert Park Hotel is conveniently located close to the city center. And a short walk to the DART. Plenty of restaurants and pubs nearby,5,2017,01,19
213,Business Trip,"A very good option for business trips due to the location near the RDS. Good meeting facilities. The only ""bad"" thing is the next door demolition works taking place which of course has nothing to do with the hotel itself",4,2017,01,19
213,Much imprved since last visit,"Addition of a Nespresso machine in the room is excellent.  It seemed odd not to have coffee/tea available in the room previously.  Staff are friendly and welcoming.  Breakfast is good, though coffee not great.  Bar food limited menu, and quality can vary.  Lovely atmosphere.",5,2017,01,19
213,"Great hotel, fantastic team.",One of my favourites when visiting Ireland. The place is great and the recent addition of Nespresso coffee machines to all rooms make the place even better. We missed our man Gerrard this time around but a special mention must go to Lara and the team who were exceptional from start to finish as we had a couple of issues with our booking on this occasion. We will return soon.,5,2017,01,18
213,Excellent location,Ideally located to attend BT Young Scientist competition. Friendly and professional staff. Great choice of food. Nespresso machine in room is a welcome addition. Great WiFi throughout hotel. Nothing negative to report.,5,2017,01,18
213,Business,"Room was clean, and a good size.  All the staff were very helpful and friendly.

Only negative was that there was only one electric socket in the room that was easy to access. Not great for charging lots of devices at the same time.",4,2017,01,18
213,Excellent customer service,"Like coming back home.  Familiar and welcoming. This hotel stands out because of its wonderful customer service.  Comfortable, bright, spacious rooms, excellent room service food, and parking on site. Wishing walking distance of very good local restaurants.",5,2017,01,18
213,Herbert Park Hotel,"Herbert Park Hotel, is located in the Ballsbridge neighborhood.  Very convenient location, with Pub's and restruants close by.  The US Embassy is steps away.  Good breakfast.  You can easily walk to CBD Dublin.  There are 3 sports stadiums walking distance for Rugby, Hurling, Soccer.",5,2017,01,18
213,Classy hotel in a fine location,"I recently stayed in Herbert Park Hotel on a business trip and found it to be classy without being over the top. Breakfast was very nice, the atmosphere in the hotel and around it was good, and the room was very comfortable. I would highly recommend.",5,2017,01,16
213,A well-appointed and well-run hotel in Dublin's nicest neighbourhood,"This is the sort of well-appointed hotel you expect in a capital city.  It is small enough to feel intimate and large enough to have all the amenities that a business traveller or holiday-maker would want.  The staff are polite, engaging and well-trained. The Park itself is lovely and just behind the hotel.  I'll stay there again and again.  ",5,2017,01,16
213,Love hotel. First time I had kids stay with me. They too loved hotel and the staff were so thoughtful to them.,"From once we arrived until we checked out the staff took care of all my questions and needs. They were excellent with kids, especially at breakfast. Reception staff were very friendly and helpful. They were very helpful with information on funderland and even went on line to find out best deals on tickets to buy. ",5,2017,01,15
213,Good hotel in Excellent location - Just dont forget the Tea Drinkers!,"Everything was good. Fantastic location and extremely pleasant and efficient staff.
 My only suggestion would be to revert to providing a kettle for us tea drinkers without having to ask for it.  I know that you supply a very modern coffee maker, but the water from that just isn't hot enough for tea.,  Plus also give us ( tea-drinkers) a decent sized mug or cup.
",5,2017,01,15
213,The ever fabulous Herbert Park Hotel,"My husband and I are regular weekend visitors to this brilliant hotel and have just enjoyed another fabulous 2 nights. Everything about this hotel oozes style; from the efficient, smooth check-in experience to the friendliness of the staff to the clean, bright luxury rooms ensures that your leisure trip is stressless and enjoyable. Breakfasts here are right up there for quality and choice and the dining room is a bright, airy space overlooking the delightful Herbert Park with its beautiful walkways, lake and gardens. The bar food offers good choice and is served almost at any time throughout the day. This weekend we decided to have our evening meal in the hotel's  main restaurant  and found this to be as good as any of the top eateries anywhere in Ballsbridge or the city centre. Our food was delicious; top quality and well presented and the  service was so good.  We will definitely be dining here again.  Herbert Park is one of our favourite hotels and definitely when we are staying in a Dublin. We can't fault it.",5,2017,01,15
213,Excellent,"I have been using the hotel regularly for the last 9 months and the staff and hotel have been excellent.  If you stay anywhere as long as I have there will be the odd occasion when something is not quite right, light bulb blows etc (all thought this happens rarely). At the Herbert you only have to mention it and the staff respond immediately without making a fuss.  Business run on the quality of their staff and it is a pleasure to stay at this hotel.",5,2017,01,13
213,Expensive !,"I'm often coming to Dublin for work. in 2017, the hotel has increased their room rate by 20 euros. Breakfast is good enough but expensive and if you want a hot chocolate for your breakfast, you need to pay extras ! They give you only tea or coffee, if you have children I suggest you to go somewhere else.
I ordered food from outside, restaurant forgot to bring knife and forks. So I asked the reception if i can take knife and fork from the restaurant. Guess what ? They are charging this 6.50 Euros !! For only Knife and fork ! How can we accept this in a 4 stars hotel ? This is clearly unacceptable !
They are claiming this is the hotel policy ! Staff is professional and nice but because of that kind of hotel policy, I prefer to book somewhere else....
I ordered a burger in the room : the waiter told me the chef is french... Well i'm french and I don't understand how a french chef can cook such burger! It was oily, fatty, and not tasty at all. 
Hotel managers : I'm happy to discuss further with you directly, you should review your hotel policy because paying 6.50 eur for a knife and a fork, this is the first I am seeing that! and I have done a lot of hotels all around the world... regarding the burger, you should try eat before giving to your clients!

Only positive point : beds are comfortable and big! cheers!",3,2017,01,12

213,"Nice rooms, wouldn't be mad about the bar food.","The rooms are pleasant, clean and comfortable.
Reception staff are attentive and helpful.
In my opinion the bar staff and food wouldn't be to the same standard as the rest of the hotel. 

To be honest, I think it was a little too expensive for the stay when breakfast wasn't even included in the deal we booked. 

Would stay here again if the price was less.",3,2017,01,07
213,Business stay,"My two night visit  was onerall good. However, I had to cancel my Visa Card that day and despite Company booking, chequebook and passport hotel policy applied- Visa or cash only? it was a late check in.

213,Friendly staff,"The hotel was very quiet as its early January. The staff were very friendly. 
We asked for main courses at 5pm. We did'nt want sandwiches. The waiter said hot food did not start to 6pm but said he would ask the chef.
He came back to say we could order. We both had salmon. It was very nice. It was roughly 18 euros each.
Very nice hotel. I would go back.",4,2017,01,05
213,good location,"decent sized room, probably in need of an update, shower is poor and air con not working when we stayed, also parking is 12 per night, adds up! walking distance of some great bars and restaurants, hailo is a godsend for taxi bookings.

213,DC,"Only people to eat in restaurant, eggs benedict very ordinary and not worth ordering, staff friendly, clean and good location for shopping or bars and restaurants. Manager was mean with money when an issue arose but was friendly and polite. Stayed in a suite and very basic compared to others I have styed in, no lounge or additional space and bathroom very small, suppose the Hotel is older than others that I have stayed in. Best part is its location if you like that part of Dublin.",4,2017,01,04

213,Great Business Hotel,"Excellent business hotel conveniently located. Very comfortable, rooms nicely appointed, excellent service. I especially appreciated the in-room espresso machine (make sure to ask for a room that has one if that's important to you as these are new and not sure every room currently has one).

213,An excellent hotel in the heart of Dublin,"The Herbert Park Hotel has an awkward entrance gate for tour buses, but that's about the only negative thing about it.  The hotel is in the fashionable Ballsbridge area of the city and walking distance from the high street which abounds in pubs, souvenir shops, fashion and designer shops, restaurants and cafes.  The rooms are well appointed with crisp linen and plush towels.  The traditional Irish hospitality comes to the fore with a welcome drink for tourist bus passengers and a reception with a glass of wine and light savory snacks/nuts.  
Well worth booking into and enjoying the luxury of Irish charm and hospitality.",5,2016,12,30

The staff as the cherry on top - a delight particularly Egle - attentive to the end. Thanks for keeping our memories great. ",5,2016,12,30
213,Lovely Hotel in Beautiful Surroundings,"We stayed in the Herbert Park Hotel on the 28th December to get away from the hustle and bustle of Christmas. We booked the Dinner, Bed & Breakfast deal and it was just my wife and I. 
The hotel is spotless. It has a lovely bar area which serves lunch and light dinner. We had the cup of soup with sandwich combo and it hit the spot. After we went for a walk in Herbert Park which you can enter from the hotel grounds.
We had dinner in the restaurant and again it was high quality. The service was excellent and the wait staff very knowledgable about the food and wine.

Organised for us by the wonderfully-named Apple ( who could not have been more efficient and friendly, and who greeted us on arrival and checked a few times during the meal that we were being looked after), everything went well. A perfectly-located table – we did have a two-month-old baby in tow, so that was important; excellent food & wine and a tremendous level of service from Goran, for whom, in spite of being extremely busy, nothing was too much trouble.

 Overall then, a great start to the Christmas festivities. Thanks Apple and Goran.",5,2016,12,25

213,Great retreat ,"I recently stayed 2 nights with my husband and children aged 7 and 10.  From reception to departure all staff were lovely and efficient. The food was excellent with kids menu keeping children very happy. The interconnecting rooms were comfortable and gave my husband and myself some welcome space. Herbert Park itself, next to hotel) is beautiful and has a play ground (across the road). It was great to have the city centre a cab ride (€15) away and to retreat to the hotel when the kids needed a break.",5,2016,12,21

213,Great Stay ,"Just spent a couple of nights at the Herbert Park in Ballsbridge. 
Excellent hotel, high end accommodations with a reasonable price tag and ample parking which is great. Excellent location, really accessible to the city center and many great bars and restaurants on the doorstep. The hotel also has a great lounge for meeting friends and relaxing. Lunch is particularly good there. On our recent visit staff were so friendly. ",5,2016,12,19
213,Best Business Hotels in Dublin,"The Herbert Park is an excellent business hotel.  The rooms are very high quality, comfortable and quiet.  There is no sound from outside or the corridor.

213,Pavilion Restaurant Worth Visiting,"As a local Dubliner, I've never actually stayed at the hotel, however I've eaten in the Pavilion Restaurant in the hotel a number of times. Each time the food has been flawless and the service exemplary.

I recently had business lunch with colleagues (of varying ages, backgrounds, tastes, etc.) in the run-up to Xmas and I honestly couldn't fault the menu choice, price, service or food quality. I had the poached pear starter and risotto for mains. Delicious. 

Highly recommend if you're in the D4 area.",4,2016,12,19
213,Perfect,Everything about this hotel is great. It's like my home from home in Dublin. This is my 5th time staying in this hotel. Rooms are very spacious and well laid out. My favourity feature is the brunch. Don't need to get up early for breakfast!,5,2016,12,19

213,herbert park,Ok hotel but could get better in the area for the price. House keeping is not doing its job properly as I had a number of problems with my room such as tv not working and phone not working. Irish breakfastw as also extremely expensive at €19.50 per person and the standard was very average,3,2016,12,16
213,Improvements,"Although I am rating to 4 (very good) I see some points for improvement:
- Gym area - add more material such as free weight, TRX, etc. for functional training
- Espress during breakfast to expensive.
Regards,",4,2016,12,16
213,Nice Overnight Experience,"I was recommended this hotel by my business colleagues and it works really well.

The hotel staff are really friendly and helpful and the check in, bar and breakfast experiences were really good.

I only had breakfast there so can only comment on this meal and it really was quite good.

From a location perspective, its not ""downtown"" and close to the sports stadiums. There are a few bars and restaurants in walking distance, and the park besides the hotel looks pretty nice... 

I would stay there again next time I'm in Dublin.",5,2016,12,16
213,Quite Hotel and good for couples,"Good and quite Hotel. Ideal place for couples who seek quitness and away for the downtown traffic for sure. You really can enjoy early morning walk in the Herbert Park which right next to the Hotel and some great walking & chatting time with your companions. You need 20 minutes or so by Taxi to reach the downtown in traffic time.

213,User friendly,Top notch very relaxing  good value parking well secured will return early 2017 Edward on reception  an excellent ambassador  for Herbert park  what ever salary he is on now please increase thank u Colm and Clare Kilkenny and wexford,5,2016,12,15
213,Nice business hotel,"Well appointed, good size rooms. (Although the new air conditioning appeared unable to give out any heat!). Pleasant bar and lounge areas. Well situated for good restaurants and pubs within walking distance. Efficient service at check-in and check-out. A good choice for the business traveller to Dublin",4,2016,12,15
213,Herbert,Need to improve on all that I have complained about. I will stay here again if their is a change. This hotel does not currently represent it star status. The corridors have a terrible musky smell. Having said the above the staff were very attentive ,3,2016,12,15
213,Excellent Hotel,Lovely Hotel with very friendly staff. The location is ideal in the heart of Ballsbridge with plenty of good restaurants within walking distance. The rooms are very clean and the beds are large and comfortable ,5,2016,12,14
213,Most Comfortable stay,"I just love it here, the staff are lovely and contribute to the relaxing  atmosphere in the hotel and I enjoy taking in a lovely walk in the park to make it a  really relaxing stay. The room/bed is very clean and comfortable. The hotel is also lovely and quite. The shower's level of pressure was blissful.  
My only issue is the price of a full Irish breakfast of  €20.00, this is way too expensive! However, thank god DonnyBrook Fair is close by and I recommend their fresh baked goods and their sausage rolls are so tasty, coffee is good too!",5,2016,12,14
213,Ripped off,Biggest disappointment was being charged €15:70 the following day for drinks which we didn't have. Very sneaky way of getting money from customers and it made me seriously review if I would ever stay again or recommend it,3,2016,12,13
213,night in dublin,"   We had very pleasant overnight stay,Have stayed often at the Herbert Park,Its location ,staff and quality all combine to make it an ideal base for when in Dublin. We ate at the hotel restaurant ,food was good but the dining room was a narrow space beside the bar and main lobby ",5,2016,12,13
213,Excellent,"Oveall had a wonderful experience in staying at Herbert Park.  Except for the late nite food options for romm service, everything else was top notch.  The hotel was clean and the staff were wonderful/helpful. Im a stickler for clean and comfy rooms and the one i stayed was wondeful in these regards. ",5,2016,12,12
213,Great Location but pricey on the food.,"Received a voucher from a friend my husband and I stayed for the 2 nights. The location is fantastic great restaurants and pubs right on the door step as is local transport.  
Hotel is very spacious, staff are friendly.  The only fault I had was we had dinner there on one night as our voucher had excess and needed to be used due to the date expiration.  We expected to experience a nice intimate meal as it was a la carte.  Unfortunately the restaurant was approx 6 tables to the side of the bar counter of which there was no divide between us and the lobby.  We could have had the bar food for a fraction of the price only 10ft away from where we sat.  The prices were way off the mark, we ate for a lot less the previous night at Rolys and it was fabulous and intimate.  Definitely will return but not to dine.",5,2016,12,12
213,Friendly Staff & Great Location,"Great hotel in an excellent location!  We had two separate bookings for the two nights but the excellent friendly staff, ensured we were allocated the same room for the two nights so we wouldn't need to move.  This was greatly appreciated considering it was a particularly busy ""Irish rugby match” weekend and the hotel was full.  The room was comfortable, the Nespresso machine a nice  addition in the room!  We will be back!  :)",5,2016,12,12
213,Poor value for money.,The location is ideal.  The room rates were reasonably priced but the Food & Beverages we felt were  grossly overpriced. I felt our stay was poor value for money and the charge for parking was Over the top. ,3,2016,12,12
213,Solo travelling,"Fabulous hotel, friendly staff. Half hour walk to city centre. Car park facilities. Mini bar. Good hair dryer in room. Comfy bed. Powerful showers. Missed breakfast but lunch was lovely. Would definitely stay again. ",4,2016,12,12
213,Exemplary service from all members of staff,"Each visit to the Herbert Park is flawless. The check in experience is genuinely pleasant, as is the check out. The staff seem to take a personal interest in every guest and their needs. Rooms are comfortably furnished with a new state of the art air conditioning system and Nespresso machines with instructions and a range of coffee pods. The detail is to their credit, as even the cups were Nespresso with take away Nespresso cups in the room also. We had a concert to attend that evening and the business area in the foyer was available to print our tickets. It was all so hassle free and relaxing, I would return over and over for the experience. The setting, decor, staff and grounds all make this an outstanding choice regardless of your reason to visit. Sometimes 'just because' is enough!",5,2016,12,12
213,Excellent stay,Great location.  Lovely modern bar and reception. Room.was spacious. Bed was very comfortable. Would definitely recommend this hotel. Great Christmas feel. Staff were very friendly and attentive. Will be back ,5,2016,12,12
213,Neil and Una Armstrong,"What a wonderful experience.  Staff very polite at all times.  Food excellent.  Hotel warm and inviting, but yet, very secure.  Everything was answered with a ""Certainly, that's not a problem"".  The Breakfast delivered to our room was lovely, and it was nice to know that we did not have to rush out.  In fact, we packed our one night's stay, into two fantastic days sightseeing Dublin as ""real tourists"".  One of our best short breaks in a long time.",5,2016,12,12
213,Fantastic Experience,"Stayed many times in the Herbert Park Hotel,last time on 8th December.i have stayed in a lot of Irish hotels ,but I have to say that Herbert Park Hotel is one of my favourites. Situated in a quiet cul de sac inBallsbridge,overlooking the famous Herbert Park,with its lovely walks and beautiful lake. The hotel is amazing,giving a feeling of warmth and comfort as you enter. Decor is lovely. All the staff very friendly and so helpful. An upgrade was very much appreciated. Bedroom added to the peace and warmth.  Food was excellent, prescecco with canapés was a lovely surprise.great bar food and a first class breakfast. 10minutes taxi ride,good bus service or a lovely walk to Grafton St. I would highly recommend this beautiful hotel.",5,2016,12,11
213,"Great service, friendly staff",The room I stayed in was clean and spacious. The bed was advertised as a single but it felt more like a double. The location was ideal to meet the purpose of my visit and the staff were very friendly and offered helpful advice.,5,2016,12,11
213,Hidden Gem,Good business hotel with lovely and responsive front office staff.  Great location and reasonably priced hotel rooms make this a no brainer.  Would benefit from a full service business centre capable of printing and scanning documents but free hi speed wifi makes up in part for this deficiency.,4,2016,12,11
213,Dec 8th 2016,"A one night stay B&B was excellent. Great hotel in a great location. Really good staff. Got an upgrade without asking. Very efficient and charming. Thank you, we will be back! Room 411 overlooks Herbert Park. Only downside a lady in adjoining room (door locked)had a cough but that's not the fault of the hotel!Temp in room was set at 24c but it felt stuffy so we turned it down.Staff are very professional without being in  your face.Yes a very Good hotel I must say.",4,2016,12,10
213,Tired rooms and no irons!,"Ok, it's a small gripe but the rooms were a little tired and old looking. I did however hear that the other floors were under refurbishment so hopefully if you visit you will get plusher rooms. The breakfast was very good although the hot buffet was not that inspiring/ but they did make things to order. The thing that really got me annoyed is having to ask for an ironing table and iron. This is a hotel frequented by business people and an iron to increase those folded shirts is a vital requirement. Every time I asked for one the housekeeping took it away and I resorted to storing it in the cupboard but they still took it away! 

Just get an iron and ironing table installed in every room for gods sake!

The hotel is near to a great range of hotels in the locality so you'll be spoilt for choice. I recommend The Goose and the Girl (situated in between two pubs) - great food and excellent service. ",3,2016,12,10
213,excellent stay,"Parking a huge bonus.. Hotel is central , spacious and breakfast is always good and wholesome. Rooms are comfortable and in terms of Dublin location, it is good value for money paid. I will be back again. I just like its calmness",5,2016,12,09
213,Another excellent stay and experience at the Herbert Park,"I use this hotel regularly when staying in Dublin on business or leisure.
Parking, Check-In, Rooms, Food, Service and Location are all excellent however it's the staff who are the key reason I return.
Nothing is too much trouble and no matter if it's the Reception, Room Service, Bar or Restaurant....everyone is friendly, professional and goes the extra mile to make sure guests have a good experience at the hotel.
The rooms are clean, well furnished and quiet-location great for D4 and the fact that you can park literally outside the main entrance is very convienent too.

",5,2016,12,09
213,Good value for money,"This hotel has a great service due their staff. Very well located in the city, with options for dining close by.  I have returned every year. Good breakfast included. They could improve the gym but the herbert park on the side give the opportunity for a good outside walk.",5,2016,12,08
213,December Stay,"Business Trip and travelling on my own - comfortable stay but the room was very small, only one plug which was not in use considering I needed phone charged, hair dryer in the morning -  disappointing considering the cost.",3,2016,12,08
213,"Close to the city, good value for the premium location",We've stayed there a few times - a bit corporate but very good standards and service. Like the new trend in good Irish hotels that good grade Irish Pale Ale (IPA - craft beer) is on offer. Friendly staff.,5,2016,12,07
213,Ripped off!,"Confirmed booking on booking.com and was charged twice for room, even though was booked under same name and mobile number, hotel insisted on charging us for two rooms.  Also have to pay for parking. Twelve Euro per night.  Hotel reception said they knew it was the same person double booking and pretended to be apologetic but still charged me for an extra room!",1,2016,12,07
213,Beautiful hotel close to the city centre,"Herbert Park is a brilliant area to stay if you are going to Dublin. The neighbour hood is upmarket and the park next door is lovely for a stroll. The rooms were comfortable. Although we didn't order food at the hotel, the drink prices were reasonable.",4,2016,12,07
213,Lovey stay,We had a very enjoyable stay in The Herbert Park Hotel.The staff were ever so friendly and helpful .The hotel was clean and our room was kept to a very high standard .Where our room was situated ensured that we got plenty of uninterulrupted sleep.Our breakfast menu had a wide range with plenty of fresh fruit and a full honeycomb.,5,2016,12,06
213,Very good hotel and will use again,"Good car parking (not free), friendly staff and nice atmosphere in the main lobby area. In perfect location for us. Room was a triple with plenty of space and ticked all our boxes. Free wifi was also welcomed. Didn't eat in hotel as too many nice places in the surrounding areas.",5,2016,12,06
213,Outstanding,"Lovely friendly hotel. Good food, lovely friendly staff especially the head bar man Dhavam.
Good quality rooms bar and restaurant. Great location. Easy access only 5 min taxi journey to the city centre.",5,2016,12,05
213,Review,"Stayed here with a group of friends for a reunion. Very friendly and helpful staff.
Facilities could be improved by having clothes iron in room.
Room dark and insufficient lighting even with all lights on.",4,2016,12,05
213,A good spot,"A good hotel with good staff. I was there on a flying visit so unfortunately I didn't get to try the leisure facilities or the restaurant at all. However the room was good, the staff were friendly and the location is good with available parking. My only bug bear was that the TV was crap with zero channels working.",4,2016,12,05
213,Overnight in Dublin,Booked this hotel on short notice for a family get together . The location is excellent . From check in to check out we found the staff helpful and friendly. Our room was very comfortable - and very quiet . ,4,2016,12,05
213,Ideal location ten mins from three arena,Parking little expensive €12 a night and not included in price when booking! Bar was also expensive we weren't tempted to have more than one drink but I suppose we were in the capital! Everything else was perfect ,4,2016,12,05
213,Fairytale location,"A great hotel situated in a beautiful area: a romantic garden with a pond, long alleys shadowed by all sort of trees , the perfect view for the restaurant of the hotel. The rooms are very spacious, bright , comfortable and spotless. I surely enjoyed the gourmet breakfast and the elegant atmosphere. All in all, one of the most agreeable hotel experiences!",5,2016,12,05
213,Lovely Christmas visit,"Very pleased with our trip to the Herbert Park, ticked all the boxes.  The room was spotless and bed very comfortable.  I also appreciated the free wifi.  I did not eat in the hotel so cannot comment on the food.  ",5,2016,12,05
213,Basic business hotel,Nothing special. One of the many business hotels in the world. OK if office is near by. Otherwise there are better choices in Dublin. Front desk gives the feeling that you are disturbing their days when you approach,3,2016,12,04
213," Christmas family get together in the restaurant","Lovely hotel, great food in the restaurant, table overlooked the park, plenty of space for children to move in and out. Our waiter Goran was very attentive. Will return there next Christmas for our family gathering.",5,2016,12,04
213,Good Location terrible hotel,"I frequently travel to Dublin for work and have stayed at a wide range of hotels from the Hilton to the Gibson. This is by far the worse hotel I have stayed at in Dublin. Room was ridiculously small, TV did not work, whole room looked dated and just terrible, breakfast was ATROCIOUS, so yeah that's pretty much my 2 cents on the Herbert Park.

The only good thing I can think of is 1, the housekeeping staff were very good and also very nice and friendly, they did a good job. 2. You are given a bottle of water in your room. That is about it.",1,2016,12,03
213,My stay,Fab hotel - great location - helpful staff - perfect setup for a business meeting - u found the WiFi in the hotel very quick - the service was efficient - the food was good - taxi pick up efficient - no complaints ,5,2016,12,03

Very beautiful Christmas decoration of halls and lobbies, even in the basement. 
Highly recommend this place)",5,2016,12,02
213,Great staff and service!,"I enjoyed my afternoon tea in the hotel's lobby today after a walk in the park. Staff were very friendly and service was extraordinary I must say.  One of the waitresses Hana was very lovely and friendly and she kindly looked after me throughout my stay there. Although the place looked busy for lunch she always had a smile on and checked on all the other tables and assisted them very quickly. 

I raccomend this place at any time of the day! Will be coming back shortly. ",5,2016,12,01
213,Business Overnight,This hotel is well located for RDS or Aviva Stadium.  It is comfortable with very friendly and efficent staff. Rooms a very nice with strong shower (in bath with curtin) Only disappointment is that there wasnt a breakfast option before 7am so I didnt get to sample the food service. Seemed to be plenty of parking and there is a good selection of bars and restauants in the area.,4,2016,12,01
213,Leisure,Dharam was most friendly serving our drinks in lounge . Had asked for quiet room but we had workmen working on corridor early in the morning and we could hear the heating system which was located somewhere outside our bedroom window . Bed was comfy enough but pillows were hard . Bathroom is small and a bit dated but very clean . It suited for a one night stay . Glad to have tea and coffee making facility in room ,4,2016,12,01
213,Perfect restaurant service ,"We spent a pleasant evening in great ambience with superb food and wine. Specially thanks for outstanding service of Goran in the restaurant !!!  Steak was perfect, range of wines amazing.
I recommend this place for everyone 👍",5,2016,11,30
213,Pat Hogan,"Very nice stay would visit again nice rooms off a great park, very convenient for Rugby Matches. Good breakfast although i was in a hurry.. Charged phone and called taxi so great follow up. Bedroom and bed exceptionally comfortable ",5,2016,11,30
213,Dublin as usual...,"... when there is an event going on in Dublin, Hotel prices rise for no reason.
But this time it was even topped while paying a 195 EUR for a room, without breakfast, and then even having the cheek to ask for 12 EUR overnight parking. Any guest of any hotel should have free parking. I sincerely hope that the Irish Government will soon put a hold on the rip off permanently happening when it happens to happen that there is an event on when you attempt to visit your capital city.
Having said that, the hotel is lovely though, placed in a beautiful surrounding, especially in the Spring and Summer. The rooms are quite nice, maybe a bit basic, and the bathrooms could do with a bit renovating.",4,2016,11,30
213,Fanatastic rugby,"We had a great night at the Herbert Park, we were there for the rugby with friends . The staff are very friendly and professional, the service was excellent. Great atmosphere in the hotel. Rooms are very clean and have everything you would need. Great location for the rugby.",4,2016,11,30
213,Fabulous as always,"We have stayed at the Herbert Park more than 10 times and have always had a great experience but this time we were upgraded to the Pembroke suite room 516 which is amazing, we have had upgrades in the past to superior rooms but the Pembroke Suite is on another level, with separate living room, 2 bathrooms and outdoor roof terrace.",5,2016,11,30
213,Average,"Average is the word I would best use to describe my stay in this hotel. Location is
Good if you need to be in the halls ridge area. I was attending a rugby math group in the Avila and found it a very convient location ",3,2016,11,30
213,Excellent,"Recently stayed in the Herbert Park Hotel again.  The staff are so friendly and helpful.  The location is perfect, a short stroll into the city for some shopping.  I will definitely be staying here again.",5,2016,11,29
213,I would highly recommend this hotel,"I recently stayed at this Hotel for the Ire rugby game & could not recommend it high enough. Superb staff, excellent facilities & great location. There was great atmosphere around the hotel before & after the game 🏈🍀 I'll be back for sure!  ",5,2016,11,29
213,Nice spot,"I stayed here mainly as it was the most suitable hotel near a venue where I was studying. The rooms were clean and comfortable, the staff friendly. Really nice position next to the park. Some lovely pubs and restaurants nearby. Breakfast was superb",4,2016,11,29
213,Another Wonderful Getaway in the Herbert Park,"We come to Dublin to take a break from the kids every now and then, and the Herbert Park is always our choice for accommodation in Dublin.  We stayed recently for a rugby weekend, and the atmosphere was fantastic in the lobby and bar after the match.  The Hotel is walking distance from the Aviva so it's very convenient.  And we also walked into the city centre another day.  The rooms are modern and comfortable, just what you need to relax. The staff are very welcoming and nothing is a problem.... it's so easy.  Well done, and we'll see you again in 2017",5,2016,11,29
213,The best hotel for a rugby week-end,"High quality modern rooms; great facilities; staff who know what they are doing and care about doing a good job.  Best of all; the great atmosphere of Ballsbridge is right outside, but the rooms are quiet.",5,2016,11,28
213,Great hotel in brilliant location,Stylish comfortable hotel in Ballsbridge. Really liked the Nespresso machine in the room! Hotel is only about a 20 minute walk to lively Merrion Row and about 30 minutes walk from Grafton Street. Highly recommended.,5,2016,11,28
213,Charming and affordable,"Lovely hotel in good location to access various places in Dublin, including the LUAS and trains.

The menu has a good choice of 4-5 dishes for each course, so between the 6 of us we tasted 4 different dishes form each course and all were very tasty and nicely presented.

213,Experience not to be missed,"My recent first visit to the Herbert Park Hotel was a fantastic experience from start to finish.  From the Porter from Drogheda (cant remember his name!) who got into my car with me on arrival (12.30 am) to direct me to the Hotel Car Park (as a one-way system) to the considerate & professional Cleaning Staff to the exceptional & outstanding Receptionist Lara Neilan I can honestly say that I have NEVER encountered such customer service in any hotel that I have visited. So much so that I am booking to go back in January.  Apart altogether from the excellent Customer Service this Hotel comes very highly recommended due to its location, spacious rooms and cleanliness throughout.  The staff are this hotels most valuable asset and they are the people who made my say so enjoyable",5,2016,11,22
213,Irish Odyssey,"by Genie-The Herbert Hotel exceeded my expectations. I would highly recommend this hotel. Friendly staff, exceptional service, and lovely grounds! Great location with many eateries and interesting places within walking distance of the hotel. The breakfast buffets were unbelievable with just about anything you would want to start off your day. Such a variety of breakfast foods. The scrambled eggs were not runny and the bacon was crispy. Excellent coffee and the staff were very friendly as well as very professional. ",5,2016,11,21
213,Overnight stay,"This is a really lovely hotel which is decorated beautifully. However, there were a couple of things which put a dampner on our stay. 
First of all, we checked with reception around 8pm if there was any availability in the restaurant for dinner and the lady at reception assured us that there was and told us to head to the restaurant. When we got to the restaurant there seemed to be only 3 tables laid out around the side of the bar for dinner service as the main eating area was being set up for breakfast.  Only one of these tables was occupied yet we were told by the waitress that there was no availability for us which I couldn't understand. We then decided to go to the room and order room service as we were starving. After an hour our food still hadn't arrived so we tried to phone room service back to see what was taking so long but there was no answer. We then tried to ring reception but the phone was engaged so my partner went down to reception and noticed that the phone was off the hook! Another 30 minutes later and our food FINALLY arrived! I couldnt fault the food at all.  We ordered burgers and some desserts and they were very nice but we were very disappointed with the wait! 
Then came time to sleep and we noticed an extremely annoying noise in the room. We thought it was the air conditioning but no matter how much we changed the settings and even turned it off the noise wouldn't stop and kept me up half of the night. 
The bedsheets in our room were also ripped at each side and the quilt was hanging out of them. 
Aside from these issues, our room was very spacious and the bed was comfortable and the coffee machine was a lovely touch. ",3,2016,11,21
213,Rugby weekend,Excellent hotel and staff. Car park should be free to residents. Bedroom good and bed very comfy. Nespresso machine in bedroom.  Close to excellent eateries and easy to find by car if car park is a little more difficult to locate. ,5,2016,11,21
213,Visit to Dublin to watch Ireland play the All Blacks,"Great hotel in a great location. Very friendly and efficient staff. Clean bright room that had everything we needed for a great stay.

213,Elbe Made The Difference,"This hotel is a breath of fresh air. The building was modern and in great condition with a lovely ambiance. The breakfast was magnificent. The rooms clean, comfy and functional - wifi was free. The key, however to success is always the staff who were extremely attentive and helpful, especially Elbe on ""front"" of house. That's what makes the difference and why I would choose to come back to HP before any other hotel in Dublin. If it's good enough for Only Murs to meet his girlfriend in....",4,2016,11,21
213,An amazing hotel with wonderful staff,"I will definitely keep coming back to this hotel - everything was perfect, not just for me but for the 5 other guests I booked 5 other rooms for.

",5,2016,11,21
213,Business stay,"Stayed recently for business as I was working across the road and the location was perfect.  Pleasant stay, though they could do with updating their TV network, have stayed a lot before and the same problem of poor TV signal due to old cable seem to be an issue. ",4,2016,11,21
213,met the high expectations made from my previous stay,"was my second stay at the Herbert Park which is a great location for Dublin 4 offices... as per first visit lovely/attentive/friendly people, surprisingly broad range at quality breakfast, quiet rooms, great local eateries, helpful with local knowledge and getting taxis for work ... really good all round experience",5,2016,11,21

213,Location is one thing  but it's the staff!,Our company uses the Herbert Park hotel for a number of years and it is a testament to the team from sales to front desk to housekeeping to bar and restaurant that we continue to do so with such confidence . Location gives the hotel a special feel with the beautiful park on the doorstep if you want a breath of fresh air or a moment of head space and you will be so well cared for from the moment you check in and will enjoy the great bar food selection even at the busiest times. It's my go to hotel in Dublin for work and personal travel.,5,2016,11,20

213,"Hotel Good, Evening Restaurant Great.","There are a bunch of other restaurants very nearby which may deter some people from dining in the hotel restaurant - don't do this. I had an outstanding meal this evening after a very tiring day and was hugely surprised and pleased.

The waiting staff are incredibly friendly, really quick and helpful with suggestions. I had a Chicken Cutlet dish to start and a Chicken Supreme dish for main (I was in a chicken mood obviously!) and both were superb. The quality of the food was excellent, served in an eye catching way and delivered on taste.

Avoided dessert (more to do with the waist line than the selection) but there looked like quite a few things I would chose on the menu. The wine list included some very good wines from Italy, France etc. as well as some New World numbers - disappointingly no sweet wine or wines from Germany but this is a minor.

This isn't your ordinary hotel restaurant and I would HIGHLY recommending giving it a shot. Hotel is actually very nice, modern and clean although nothing out of this world.",4,2016,11,16
213,Fantastic stay - phenomenal staff,The staff is one of the best I've ever worked with - courteous and knowledgeable. Went above and beyond. The room was fantastic and very clean (important on any trip) and extremely comfortable. Plan to stay here again. ,5,2016,11,16

213,Family celebration saved,"After having the stress of being let down late on Friday afternoon by the owner of an apartment we had booked months previously for a family celebration, we were able to relocate to the Herbert Park Hotel and found it an oasis of calm and efficiency. We arrived about 15 minutes after making the reservation on line and the check-in went very smoothly. We needed two rooms and were allocated two on the same floor.  Everything about the hotel was excellent and it saved our weekend celebrations. This was our first stay and it certainly will not be our last.",5,2016,11,16

Nice area. Good location. Will definitely stay again. ",5,2016,11,15
213,?,"As advised, the cooked  breakfast was poor and the bread selection showed no imagination. The evening meal the previous evening was excellent, so it appears to me that the breakfast team need more leadership and training/supervision.The other parts of the hotel are fine and we had no complaints, but a breakfast is important as it can be the last thing people experience before they leave the hotel.",3,2016,11,15
213,Weekend away in Dublin,"very nice hotel, was there on a match weekend which drove prices up. Everything was luxurious and well kept. Close to the city and Dun Laoghaire. Staff were very friendly;y and helpful. Pool or Jacuzzi would be nice but UCD is close by which has one.",4,2016,11,15

213,Great Hotel,"Very comfortable hotel, beautiful location beside the park, very helpful staff. always stay here when we are in Dublin which can be on average ten nights a year. Very good value on a Sunday night. Recent policy that  requires a two or three night stay when major events are on in the city is disappointing for me as a regular guest...",5,2016,11,15
213,Beautiful hotel in a great location,"We wanted to be outside the main part of the City yet close enough to get there fast. Herbert Park was ideal. Lovely hotel, lovely park. We walked around Herbert Park the first morning to ease the kinks out of the flight from California. Very peaceful and relaxing. I had the full Irish a couple of mornings and it was excellent. The buffet is the way to go. Fish pie one night from room service and it was also excellent. Highly recommended. ",5,2016,11,15
213,Not what it used to be,"Not a terrible hotel but looking a bit tired needs updating. Entering room was a bit ""oh..."" instead of ""yeah"". Carpets worn and room generally uninspiring. Bed was really uncomfortable, hard pillows and could feel springs in mattress. Bed advertised as King size, but it was two singles pushed together and zip lined, so had dip in the middle. Parking 12 euros for guests, not what I'd expect for a 4* hotel or room price. Breakfast wasn't included either so went elsewhere. Overall very disappointing. Wouldn't go back unless heard it had major revamp.",2,2016,11,14
213,Great hotel,Stayed overnight to watch the Ireland v Canada match at the Aviva. Great match. Great overnight stay. The hotel is in a perfect location for the stadium and the lovely area of Ballsbridge. A nice walk into the city centre too if you fancy stretching your legs after breakfast. Rooms lovely.

A very relaxing and friendly atmosphere throughout the hotel and any staff members we met were exceptional, Looking forward to the next stay.",5,2016,11,14
213,Nice Hotel but expensive,"Clean nice hotel in a great location to Aviva and RDS. Breakfast is until 10am weekdays and 10:30am at the weekend. My experience was food was not replenished after 9:15am at the buffet so it was not at pleasant as it could have been. No eggs, bread for toast or mushrooms just left overs in the trays, expected more.",4,2016,11,14
213,great place to say,"We chose the hotel for location and proximity to Aviva stadium,  staff were excellent and overall our stay was very enjoyable.  We ate in the bag and the food was excellent,  we had our 8 year old son with us and the staff were brilliant to him,    I would recommend this hotel.  ",5,2016,11,14

213,Weekend visit to Dublin - great stay,We made a flying weekend visit to Dublin to see old friends and were thoroughly impressed with out hotel choice.  Excellent room and within walking distance of Aviva and RDS stadia.  A good selection places to eat nearby and the metro a short walk if you didn't want the very pleasant walk into Dublin.  As with all good hotels in Dublin nowadays you are paying a full capital price for your stay.  No comments about the food as we didn't eat in the hotel.,5,2016,11,12
213,Great place to stay. ,We have stayed here on numerous occasions and it is a great hotel. Rooms were coming comfortable and clean. The restaurant is excellent and desserts are fantastic. A great choice at breakfast. Friendly staff. ,5,2016,11,12

213,Excellent,"Great location beside the beautiful Herbert  Park , the Aviva and  the RDS , while within walking distance of the city centre. The seafront is easily accessible for walkers and runners. While the food in the Herbert Park is excellent, Girl and the Goose just across the road is a wonderful alternative. Parking is plentiful and reasonable. As repeat guests we always feel valued and appreciated. The Herbert Park is the perfect choice for  luxurious and tranquil accomodation in Dublin.
",5,2016,11,11
213,Disappointing upgrade,The hotel disappointed us because we had paid extra for an upgraded room and were greatly disappointed.  Our upgrade only included 2 chocolates at night.  My complaint at the desk was not responded to.  The size of our room and the view were exactly as non upgraded rooms.  We did get 2 pieces of chocolate each evening.,2,2016,11,11
213,Weekend treat,"Room rate was expensive and staff not prepared to negotiate upgrade despite information regarding the special weekend and hotel not busy 
Restaurant staff very helpful and room staff equally so 
We have stayed at this hotel many times and felt that returning guests should be upgraded considering how expensive the weekend rate per room is.  ",4,2016,11,11
213,Excellent Hotel,"Lovely hotel, clean comfortable room, good food, friendly staff.

213,Marathon Hotel,"Excellent location, friendly staff. As a travelling marathon runner I was able to avail of a late checkout (4pm) this was very much appreciated, however it did come at a price.
The location could not have been better for the marathon. The staff accommodate my family by giving us an extra bed at very late notice (i.e. on arrival). Couldn't fault the staff or the hotel. ",4,2016,11,11
213,Herbert Park Hotel,"Herbert Park Hotel is a place I'd love to go back to. Very comfortable, great atmosphere, clean rooms, courteous staff and great food.  I stayed at other places while on my vacation to Ireland but this was one of my favorites!",5,2016,11,11
213,Recommendation for an overnight Dublin stop so gave it a try,And it was a very good hotel. We were with a baby and we're upgraded to an end of corridor room which was great. Only thing that was not very good was the fact our cot was not ready in the room and then my husband had to set it up as housekeeping couldn't do it - plus the mattress was slightly stained. It's not really a traditional hotel for families so I can understand how these things were slightly overlooked so it was not a big deal or us. Would return!,4,2016,11,11
213,Home away from home .,"We love going to this hotel , it's so welcoming and a fab place to stay. From the minute you walk through the door to the time you leave you feel very well looked after . Will be back again before Christmas.",5,2016,11,11

The hotel was busy but we were well looked after and the location was perfect for our needs. I would highly recommend this hotel. My only issue is that we didn't have parking included in our room price and that was quite expensive so try to book a rate with breakfast and parking included.",5,2016,11,11
213,business trip,"Really comfortable stay, staff were great also! and breakfasts were amazing!  The hotel was also in a good location, and even though my stay was business related, was able to get in and out of town, and to and from the office very easily. ",5,2016,11,11
213,Room for early risers,This was my fifth visit to this hotel so obviously I like it but unfortunately our room was directly above the delivery entrance - I actually thought it was road works starting very early but no the linen van depositing metal baskets - then the other deliveries arrived - avoid room 133 unless you like to waken very early.,4,2016,11,11
213,Great hotel,"Great hotel ... excellent location . Staff very professional ,  helpful & friendly . Very comfortable room & well equipped..
Great breakfast  with excellent pleasant service....very efficient check in /out .. easy access to car park . ",5,2016,11,10
213,A wonderful first stay in Ireland,The Herbert Park Hotel was very pleasant in Dublin. It is centrally located and the hotel has a sumptuous breakfast buffet! The employees were all very gracious. The Park behind the hotel was exceedingly pleasant to walk in. There are many wonderful restaurants within walking distance. We lucked upon The Lobster Pot  just a short distance from Herbert Park. It was delicious and had great ambiance as did this hotel.,5,2016,11,10
213,Great Hotel. Friendly Staff,We always meet up with friends of ours at rugby internationals and always stay at the Herbert Park Hotel. Excellent hotel and great staff. The front desk staff are lovely and always look after us. Great atmosphere on rugby days!!! Look forward to the next visit!!,5,2016,11,10
213,Great place to stay in Dublin.,"We were treated royally at Herbert Park. I would recommend this hotel to anyone wanting a very special home away from home. Since we were part of a tour group, I do not know the cost per night, but the tour cost was very reasonable and worth every penny of it. ",5,2016,11,09
213,Great Stay!,"Enjoyed my stay very much, location is very convenient for the RDS.  Would definitely stay here again.  Staff was friendly and helpful, convenient to church on Sunday.  Meals were great too.  Single room was roomy!",5,2016,11,09
213,By Eileen Nov 5th,I would stay in this Hotel again as the amenitjies are good but I would eat somewhere else as the price at the Hotel restaurant is very expensive .  Two toasted specials a coffee and a tea priced at 29 euros.,3,2016,11,09
213,Beautiful hotel in Dublin,"Lovely hotel with very friendly helpful staff close to Aviva stadium. Possible to walk into town (about 20-30 min) or take the bus. Lovely rooms. Peaceful place to stay. Rooms were nicely presented. Restaurant adequate, but nicer food options available very close by.",5,2016,11,09
213,Wonderful experience,"The rooms were wonderful. The staff was exceptional.  Every time we needed anything they were there.  Proactive, and great attitude.  Loved the staff!  Great location.

213,brilliant,beautiful hotel we would definitely recommend it to anyone who is willing to stay in balsbridge .the staff are so nice and friendly the room is absolutely beautiful and comfortable and cosy.i really enjoyed my stay ,5,2016,11,09
213,Would Return Again,"Great place to stay, locations is great and close to public transport into the city centre. Located in a very nice area of Dublin, quite a few restaurants and pubs near by but not so many that it's rowdy. I went with a group of friends and we enjoyed our time at the hotel, staff were great and gave us some good advice about places to go and see! Would definitely return.   ",4,2016,11,09
213,Nice Hotel,"Great Location. Price was right and we were able to get an early check-in as we had just arrived from the United States. We did not have any meals at the hotel, but I assume it is ok. Again the location is great. Walking distance to everywhere. The staff were excellent. ",5,2016,11,09
213,Good Location Quiet,"Very satisfactory good location Nice hotel, very friendly staff, good atmosphere , lovely view of park from breakfast area, great breakfast. Staff very helpful at breakfast time. I can recommend the hotel, I would definitely stay here again.. ",5,2016,11,09
213,Dissapointed,"The in room coffee nespresso machine makes small cups of coffee with an inadequate supply of the pods along with the milk  and the tea it makes is appalling. The cooked breakfast was warm, getting dry and hard, the sausages were inedible.",3,2016,11,09
213,Great place to stay,I especially like the room service food and hours of operations. It made my adjustment to the timezone easier. Check in and out was great. Room was quite large (Executive Suite) and close to restaurants and chemist.,5,2016,11,09
213,Perfect Stay,Had a very nice one night stay.   Was made to feel welcome and all my needs were addressed.    Look forward to my next visit very much and would bring my family there should we visit Dublin as a family.   Thank you for making it such a pleasant experience,5,2016,11,09
213,great place,"we had a wonderful week end. The staff was extremely friendly and professional. The room we stayed in was very comfortable and spotlessly clean.. And the food and drinks i the restaurant were also excellent, The staff made us feel welcome. I recommend this hotel for a break in Dublin",5,2016,11,09
213,Fantastic hotel central to all things Dublin,"I enjoyed this hotel. The breakfast was wonderful, the rooms clean and peaceful, the staff very helpful. It was easy to get about town and overall we had a lovely time.I highly recommend this hotel. The wifi was also fast and efficient. ",5,2016,11,09
213,very nice,All over Ireland the beds are hard and the pillows worse.  I also like to have a top sheet; sorry.  That's what we Americans are used to.  The service desk was wonderful and helpful when asking questions.,5,2016,11,09
213,"Convenient, classy, and comfortable",Great staff. very helpful with an early check-in. Hotel has boutique-feel in quiet neighborhood setting but close to Dublin attractions. Would choose the Herbert Park again! Walkable to on-off bus for overview of the city and transportation to sites. Nice dining at hotel and nearby.,5,2016,11,09
213,Comfortable hotel in fine location,"This a pleasant hotel in a beautiful hotel.  Lovely neighborhood for walking,adjacent to Herbert Park.  Easy access to City Center and public transportation.  Pricey, but fairly typical for Dublin hotels. ",4,2016,11,09
213,Truly a hotel resort,"The variety for BF can be enhanced to incuse Asian and Mediterranean cuisines. Currently it is quite limited a few English breakfast kind. 
The room iron table is rather useless, a conventional one would be more useful.Toiletres should include tooth paste/brush and shaving kits .
",4,2016,11,09
213,Herbert Oasis,"I've been staying at this hotel regularly since 2002 & have always found it to be excellent. It works for me on all levels - location, staff, quality of rooms & service. In scores of visits I have never been disappointed...my default Dublin hotel. 

Neil Martin ",5,2016,11,09
213,Herbert Park Hotel Heaven,"Best location, top quality, very helpful staff. Excellent service, fantastic rooms, beautiful Herbert Park just outside, a must for a leisurely walk . Very well served by local bars & restaurants. Taxi rank just outside & the delights of Dublin City on your door step.",4,2016,11,09
213,Nice and clean hotel nearby centre,"We stayed in the hotel because it is in the neighbourhood from Google office. It is a nice hotel with friendly staff and clean rooms.
To go to the centre you have to walk 20 minutes, or you can take the bus.
It was a short stay and we enjoyed our stay. Also the breakfast was very good. ",4,2016,11,09
213,Wendy Nolan,"Overall a very nice hotel but unfortunately the crazy prices they charge, 240 euro for room only, and also the prices for food and drink in bar would put me off returning to this hotel. Better deals in hotels nearby.",4,2016,11,09
213,Business trip,"Perfectly good hotel in a good location for both my work office in Southern Dublin, and the city centre, with both walking distance. Really great selection at breakfast, and room service menu has a nice selection. Only critique is the bed was rock hard and I felt like I had slept on the floor. ",4,2016,11,09
213,Good location,"Comfortable rooms, ample parking (although this is not free), good night's sleep here 
Staff are friendly and obliging, good location in the nice ballsbridge with easy access to the city centre but also to blackrock, dun laoghaire, bray etc ",4,2016,11,09
213,"Charges 5 star, delivers 3 (ish)"," Was attending a board meet here an dyhe location was ideal. On arrival I had cause to complain about room cleanliness, stains of a dubious nature on the furniture etc. The room was changed for an uograde, but no help offered to move. The conference lunches were of poor quality. Tiny portions. Soggy bread sandwiches, highly chilled with cheap fillings. Coffee, water and refreshments were overpriced and the coffee undrinkable, being weak. This property looks like a 5 star wannabe with serious budget issues, driven by a finance team who are trying to make everry saving possible and care not a fig about quality. On insisting this matter was brought to the managers attemtion I was met with defensiveness, its good enough for everyone else (thus telling me I don't know what I'm talking about). At least the chef had the grace to look embarrassed. I was then rold one of my staff had lied to me when he had been asked to sort lunch out with hotel. The management claimed they would have sorted it and he told me they said, that's the lunch. I know who I trust. Bar staff are very pleasant and efficient, but even the location does not justifybthe pricing. Couple of days later I stayed in a 5 star in central London that was better value all round. ",2,2016,11,09
213,Always a warm welcome,"This is my preferred hotel in Dublin, by far. Professionalism in everything they do, resulting in a great customer experience, delivered consistently over the years. The hotel is well situated, the rooms are spacious and quiet and above all, the team is fantastic. ",5,2016,11,09
213,Great hotel,"Very comfortable, friendly staff.  Very clean.  Rooms very secure.  Location great no need for own 
Transport.   I have stayed here many times and would still recommend it to my friends.  I love the fact that it is beside Herbert Park and so it is easy to spend time in a beautiful setting and enjoy a pleasant walk.",5,2016,11,09
213,A break!,"We were looking forward to our stay in this hotel, we were not very demanding, just wanted a  nice friendly, clean hotel in a good location! We met a some grumpy members of staff with a serious need of people skills!! There one saving grace was the staff in the dining room, they were lovely!",2,2016,11,09
213,Business Trip,"An excellent hotel with very high standards. Very clean, very comfortable. Staff helpful, food good and location is very nice located by Herbert Park. It is a very good experience starting in this hotel which I have done a number of times",5,2016,11,09
213,Very pleasant,"A pleasant and peaceful base from which to visit the capital. Best night's sleep for some time! We really enjoyed our stay, in particular the staff were friendly and very helpful. Will very probably stay here again.",5,2016,11,09
213,Five Star Experience,"This is a  lovely comfortable hotel in great location. Ideal for leisure or business travellers, whether your stay is one or two nights or longer. The rooms are spacious and very comfortable.   The staff are friendly and go out of their way to make guests comfortable.  On site parking is hugely convenient.  
We would recommend it as a great base to visit Dublin.

",5,2016,11,09
213,Top Class Property,"So good in many way, never fails on quality or service great staff.
Always a great destination with many pubs and restaurants on your doorstep, we used public transport to get around and it works very well.",5,2016,11,09
213,Very good,"
Hotel is located in a nice area, where next to a beautiful park. Hotel was close to the stadium, where he was held in our conference. Hotel responsive, friendly staff, tasty food. Nice room, clean facility. Definitely I recommend to their friends if they will go to Dublin.",5,2016,11,09
213,Work Trip to Dublin,"Herbert Park was a great modern hotel. Rooms were big and location perfect for us with restaurants, parks and public transport close by. I was working at a conference that was held in the venue across the road and this was the perfect location for us.",4,2016,11,09
213,Wonderful,"They were wonderful from the moment we arrived to when we left.  My dad is in a wheelchair, and they helped him at every possible opportunity. 

Room's were lovely; warm with every convenience you would need.  Very comfortable beds.
Excellent service for a very reasonable price. ",5,2016,11,09
213,Family stay,Great staff with a can do attitude. Location is perfect with Herbert Park on your doorstep. Always stay here when visiting Dublin. The food is good and breakfast has improved drastically over the past year.,5,2016,11,09
213,A great single night in Dublin,"We stayed at the Herbert Park for the first time for only one night on our way to the Wexford Festival and to work engagements in the following week. I had had meetings and lunches at the hotel in the past and remembered the hotel which is convenient on the south side of Dublin for an easy exit but also within good touching distance of the City Centre. The reception was excellent, the service very good, the hotel smart modern and bright but very comfortable, food was extremely good and the bed, room and its facilities spacious and clean. The hotel is next to the park bearing its name which is worth a walk if you have more time than we did.",5,2016,11,08
213,Excellent hotel close to RDS,"I stayed here as part of a work trip and enjoyed the hotel and breakfast. I cant comment on whether the price of the rooms are good value as i didnt pay for my room; but my experience of the hotel was very good. The room is a good size and well furnished with a very comfortable bed, and i got a good nights sleep here. My room didnt have much of a view as it overlooked other buildings. Everything was very clean and in good condition. Breakfast was included and offered a great selection of fresh, healthy and cooked food options and the staff were generally very helpful and attentive although one of my colleagues was unimpressed by 1 member of staff that was disrespectful to him, but the duty manger was able to resolve the issue quickly and discretely.
the hotel bar is a nice place to drink and relax and i can recommend this hotel especially if you are attending RDS as its only a 5 minute walk away. I ate at the Baan Thai restaurant over the road - where the food was excellent and there are a number of good pubs and other restaurants within a 5 minute walk from the hotel.",4,2016,11,08
213,Extremely disappointing,"Breakfast is very very poor, quality of food is bad, toast is a cheap bread. Overall, I was disgusted with this place. Floor staff are ignorant and have no social skills, not even a smile. We have went here three times and it's the same every time. 
We won't be returning.",1,2016,11,06
213,Comfortable and close to downtown Dublin,"My wife and stayed in the Herbert Park Hotel for our 10 year wedding anniversary trip to Ireland, coordinated through CIE Tours.  This hotel was comfortable and fairly close to downtown Dublin ... a short cab ride or about a 30 min walk.  There are a few pubs and restaurants close to the hotel, so going downtown is not necessary for everything.  One of the best attributes of this hotel is that it's adjacent to Herbert Park, which is a quiet and very serene oasis in the city.

The room we stayed in was spacious, quiet, relaxing and very comfortable.  The view out the window was not great, but we weren't there to sit in the hotel room and stare out the window anyway.  The breakfast each morning was delicious and had something for everyone.  Being able to sit in the dining room, looking out at Herbert Park, planning the day ahead was a great way to start the day.  Also, sitting in the lounge at the end of the day for a drink was peaceful.

The staff at the hotel was friendly, helpful and extremely accommodating. They were always willing to offer assistance and provide tips for adventures around Dublin and throughout Ireland.  In fact, one instance of this was being told about Smithwick's Ale.  One staff member explained that this is the oldest beer in Ireland and her love of it came from her father and that it was brewed close to her family home.  She said we should try to experience it if possible.  Based on her stories, we stopped in Kilkenny to tour the Smithwick's Brewery and sample their ales.  From that point forward, Smithwick's pints were a part of most of our meals for the rest of our journey around Ireland.

We are currently determining how and when we can tour Ireland again.  If we can make this happen, a return stay at the Herbert Park Hotel will be a part of those plans.",5,2016,11,05
213,Great little hotel in a nice area,We arrived early in the morning after an overnight flight.  They were very accommodating and allowed us to check in early.  The hotel is located in a nice safe area with some good restaurants and a nice little park behind the hotel.  We had a wonderful walk and were able to catch a bus or walk to the train station which was maybe a 5-10 minute walk.  Staff was very friendly and the hotel was always clean and tidy.,4,2016,11,02
213,Fine hotel in a fine area,"The area were this hotel is located, is the district of the foreign embassys, so as you can imagine it is quite and fine. The hotel is fine, the rooms very good and clean. We think the price was a bit high, we do not know if this was because of the Dublin marathon that was this weekend. Breakfast was not included (continental costed 15.5€ per person) and was ok, but we got breakfast outside after the first day which was better. We recommend it as the busstop also is very close and handy, but we will check the prices for the next time.",4,2016,11,02
213,Amazing,"We visited Dublin as my husband was racing the marathon. We had originally booked into a B&B, through air B&B. When we arrived at our original accommodation, disappointed would have been an understatement! 
We quickly searched the internet for an alternative. There was 20,000+ runners in the marathon which made a lot of places booked up. I, at this point was getting a little upset. We had been travelling a long time. 
Finally, Herbert park had a room! We quickly got into a taxi and headed over there. 
On arrival. Beautiful, large lobby area, and reception staff polite and helpful. So much so, that when they heard of our story we were given a free upgrade to an executive suite! 
Our room was big! Spotlessly clean.Bed extremely comfortable. Large bathroom. Jacuzzi bath, which was great for when you've run a marathon! And a coffee machine. There was also a mini bar, but was quite expensive. 
The bar and food was rather expensive. We had booked a table in the restaurant  one night, but I would t do that again. The terrace bar meals are better and more value for money. 
Breakfast was amazing. 
The people of Dublin are the most friendliest we have ever met. A beautiful city, beautiful people.
All in all, we had an amazing time at the Herbert park, and would return in a heartbeat. 
They turned our nightmare of a start to an enjoyable experience. 
Thank you. ",5,2016,11,01
213,Superb experience again..!,"Stayed here for a night over the bank holiday weekend (Sunday). Couldn't say enough about the general quality of our experience from the original booking,  to our check out. Excellent hotel, surroundings and the staff could not have been more helpful. We had an elderly relative with limited mobility with us and everybody was so accommodating to us in making sure we had no issues with family  rooms etc.  Thank you and looking forward to our return visit already. ",4,2016,10,31
213,Lovely hotel - a little out of the way,"Our CIE tour started us out in this hotel.  It is bright and modern and the room was extremely comfortable.  The breakfast was fantastic and the neighborhood was quiet with a few nice options for dinner and a beautiful park adjacent.  It's a bit far from the city proper, but our cab fare back to the hotel from the ha'penny bridge was quick and less than 10 EUR so it really wasn't inconvenient.  Would stay there again",4,2016,10,31
213,Absolutely the Best ,"The Best Business Hotel in Dublin. I Was checked-in by Night Manager Andrius. He presented me with city map also ordered me a Taxi to the Airport which cost only €28! 
Night porter Joe made the tastiest Lasagna and served with a glass of Prosecco. 
Keep going guys the same way! 
Another happy guest from Spain. Muchas gracias! ",5,2016,10,29
213,A wonderfully impressive hotel... just a little too far out of town!,"On arrival at the hotel and when we got our room I have to say, I was extremely impressed.

The hotel was light, open and modern but still cosy. Something which many big chain hotels fail to achieve.

The staff were all excellent and the food was perfect.

Sadly, it was just a little too far out of town to walk in each day. However, that may not be an issue for you at all if you don't mind the taxi fare (7 euro) or the walk.

Room rates are also pretty cheap considering the hotels quality.

",4,2016,10,28
213,Oasis of calm,"We arrived really on a Saturday morning. We were attending an event at the RDS. The hotel is literally a couple of hundred yards from the Anglesea Road entrance. The staff did everything they could to get us a room before we went over to the RDS and by 10.30 am we were in a room. We had coffee and toast which was lovely but a little expensive. The room was a generous size and had everything you would expect in a hotel of this standard. It was a little expensive but then so we're other hotels in the area because of the conference. T&e only disappointing feature was the Wi-Fi. While waiting on the foyer for a room we could not use the Wi-Fi because you need a room number to sign in. The sign-on procedure is a little old fashioned and cumbersome and the strength in the restaurant at breakfast was terrible. Breakfast was a buffet style and was good although again a little expensive. The hotel runs alongside Herbert Park and this definitely is an oasis of calm.
I would recommend unless you really cannot live without Wi-Fi!",4,2016,10,26
213,CONVENIENCE AND GOOD SERVICE.,"I have been using this hotel for a number of years for work and family events, and the occasional rugby weekend.The  service is always excellent, the location is great with many good pubs and restaurants on its door step.It has safe and convenient on site parking, and prices are  reasonable by Dublin standards.The Park view rooms are bright and comfortable, and i have often woken to the sound of the ducks in the park. Nice hotel.",5,2016,10,24
213,Great revamp for old bakery,"Lovely place to stay, and very helpful staff, might need to save up a little to bring the whole family.
Location great too, easy distance to the Dart for town and the coast, Dun Laoghaire or beyond to Bray.",5,2016,10,24
213,"Nice premises, BUT Expensive & One Extremely Rude Senior Members of Staff!","TIME OF YEAR
We stayed at the Herbert Park Hotel during the Easter Centenary weekend in 2016 as this was one of the few hotels we could find that still had availability.

POSITIVE POINTS
While the hotel building and premises were nice and many of the staff members were friendly the following are the issues that we found with this hotel:

NEGATIVE POINTS
1.  OVERLY EXPENSIVE - Despite it being an extremely busy weekend for staying in Dublin the hotel was certainly more expensive (both accommodation and food/drinks) than other 4* hotels that we had priced at the time and while in a lovely area of Dublin it was a little bit away from the city centre.

2.  UNCOMFORTABLE MATTRESS - The mattress on the bed was extremely firm and while I found it satisfactory my wife found it very uncomfortable so it's worth noting for those who would have issue.

3.  EXTREMELY IGNORANT AND RUDE MANAGER - I had a query on check-out about parking costs which involved a discussion with a manager  Well, it wasn't much of a discussion as the manager persisted in talking over the top of me each time I tried to ask him a question.  Not only that but finally after asking him the question regarding the cost he ended up walking away and refused to answer the question.
After following up with a compliant to the hotel the conclusion was essentially, 1.) I eventually got an answer to my question; 2.) This type of behaviour by a manager was deemed acceptable and there was no attempt of an apology for the behaviour of the manager.

MY CONCLUSION - AVOID THIS HOTEL
So my opinion is, if you wish to avoid a condescending encounter either avoid questioning anything at this hotel or better still avoid this hotel all together as we will be doing in future along with other associates of ours.",1,2016,10,23
213,Lovely afternoon in a hotel Herbert.,"Thank You for lovely afternoon. We were in a hotel for a coffee. Jan was very friendly and helpful, coffee was lovely. Absolutely beautiful exterior & lobby.

All the best for all staff.
Viki & Milos & Frenky",5,2016,10,23
213,Nice Hotel,"We spent 2 night at the Herbert Park Hotel as part of a CIE Tour. The Hotel is near the US Embassy. The bus to Dublin City Center is around the corner and cost 2.70 euro to get into Town. It's a good walk on a nice day into town. The hotel was very nice. The food was good also, great buffet breakfast. We had a cheese plate one night from the bar, it was excellent. All of the staff were first class and we were treated very well.",5,2016,10,23
213,Start of Honeymoon ,"We came here on a tour for our honeymoon! This hotel is beautiful and the staff is very friendly. The rooms are very comfortable. The hotel restaurant is very good. The lady, Laura, at check in was very sweet. Nevin makes a great drink. Looking forward to coming back for another visit. ",5,2016,10,23
213,Excellent Hotel,"Modern feel. Great value for a tour all inclusive.  The rooms were large and well appointed.  Windows overlooking the courtyard/front yard.  Full Irish Breakfast buffet was first rate, plenty of choices and delicious!

Very Nice!",5,2016,10,19
213,"Well run, lovely stay",Absolutely beautiful exterior & lobby. Front desk & all staff very friendly and helpful. The breakfast staff was welcoming and ran very smooth. I found myself comparing other hotels on our 12 stay to their quality service. Spa was lovely for a massage from the friendly Patricia. Wish I could've stayed there all day! This was the best hotel we stayed at the entire time.,5,2016,10,19
213,Something different,"After staying in Temple Bar for a few nights we wanted to try a different area of Dublin. This hotel is modern and is in a very fancy neighborhood with beautiful parks, homes and Embassies. There are a few pubs across the street but we walked 20 minutes to Baggot St. which is full of pubs and restaurants. The room was a basic King and did not face the park. The bed was extremely comfortable and we got a great sleep. We used the Nespresso machine and enjoyed the free waters. The bathroom was big enough with good shower pressure. We did not try the restaurant or lounge. The front desk was very helpful in arranging a taxi to the airport which ends up being over 30euros for the trip.",5,2016,10,17
213,An overnight stay in Dublin,"Stayed in this hotel with my husband and two adult children. We had two adjoining rooms which were adequate, I thought the bathrooms were not up to standard. We ordered room service which came quickly but the quality of the food was average. The one thing I look forward to is a nice relaxing breakfast.The service at breakfast was excellent,very pleasant staff but the quality of the food was poor and disappointing.",3,2016,10,17
213,"Very Welcoming Staff, Good Rates",Excellent off-season rate on Hotels.com and very pleasant room.  There are lots of good restaurants nearby and the transportation to the city center is easy.  The park adjacent is pleasant.  The restaurant is excellent for breakfast. ,5,2016,10,17
213,Great Return Visit,"We recently returned to spend an excellent weekend at the Herbert Park Hotel. It was a busy weekend in the Ballsbridge area but there was no slip in standards across the hotel. Both Gerard and Deacon at the front desk could not do enough for us and Jan our server in the terrace bar maintained this high standard of service. We would highly recommend this hotel as a top class stay in Dublin and we will return.
Derek and Deirdre",5,2016,10,16
213,Flawless,"Too me Egle is the Herbert Park, as during my short stay she was my constant person I interacted with. Checkin, booking my taxi, checked me out. The reason I would be returning is solely because of Egle. Thank you",5,2016,10,12
213,Excellent,"We stayed in the Herbert Park for a weekend in October and had an excellent experience. The location is great and close to everything we wanted (Good restaurants, shopping, Aviva stadium). The room was modern & spacious with great views over the park.  Most importantly we found all the staff to be very friendly and attentive, so a big thank you to everyone. Overall a great place to stay for leisure or business and I would highly recommend to all my friends and family.",5,2016,10,11

213,Good service & serene location,The staff are friendly and attentive.  The room is spacious and well kept. I had a pleasant 2 weeks stay at Herbert Park...I like that the location is not too close the central...it's serene and next to Herbert Park or garden. ,4,2016,10,10
213,"Excellent Hotel, Highly recommended","Stayed for one night. Perfect experience.
The room, the staff, the atmosphere, the location.
Everything was excellent and comes highly recommended.

I met a friend for breakfast in the lounge on Saturday morning and the staff were fantastic, they couldnt have been more helpful, the food was delicious and very good value for money.  Some fabulous serving touches. I couldnt recommend them highly enough from my personal experience.",4,2016,10,10
213,Polished business hotel in a great hotel,"The Herbert Park Hotel is well located, near fashionable Ballsbridge with it's nice bars, restaurants and shops  and businesses (and lots of embassies), and within walking distance of the DART (light rail system), bus services to/from Dublin and airport, and indeed, walking distance of Dublin city (we did it, via some nice pubs).

The staff were very friendly at check-in, and in and around, which is always a good indication, and indeed my pre-arrival communications were handled courteously and swiftly.

Our room was an Executive King which means complimentary newspapers, capsule coffee machine, water and luxury chocolates, and nicely spacious. It was very well appointed with a lovely view of Herbert Park. The newly refurbished air-con system was very appreciated, surprisingly needed in Dublin in Autumn!",5,2016,10,10

213,Great hotel & great food,"I wish I had stayed more than one night because the location and the hotel were great.

We had great service in the lounge area though

The food was just amazing and Goran was both professional and attentive. He is very pleasant and I think he is a credit to the hotel.
Well done guys! I will definitely recommend anyone to consider their wedding reception or even a meal in the restaurant. Make sure you do try the Guiness with the shamrock on top. !!

213,Out of the Ordinary,"The friendly, courteous and efficient staff at The Herbert Park Hotel make every stay here special. The hotel is superbly located - close to the Aviva Stadium and shopping and a stones throw from the RDS. ",5,2016,10,03
213,Gorgeous property in the heart of Dublin!,My husband is a Dubliner and we needed a neutral space among the family to stay as there weren't any options to stay with family. Our brother in law is personal friends with the hotel owner so they were kind enough to give us an amazing rate including B&B and an upgraded room overlooking the park! What a treat! We loved everything about this hotel and will be staying again when we come home from now on. The breakfast was perfect and the lounge and bar area always so friendly and accommodating.  Perfect location for all our family and to walk to town and local restaurants. We will always HIGHLY recommend this location to anyone visiting Dublin! Thank you for a perfect visit! ,5,2016,10,01
213,Work overnight,"Lovely entry lobby and bar, should maybe spend more money where it actually matters - the rooms. It was tired and old in the bathroom, two single beds pushed together but made up as singles and no ironing facility; its 2016. ",3,2016,10,01
213,Good business hotel in Dublin,"Location is out of center of Dublin, although remains easily accessible via taxi, bus or even leisurely stroll. I now always choose this hotel as it is close for office and because it is great value for its amenities and service - this is now my 8th stay. The front desk team are always very helpful, the hotel is close to a plethora of local pubs and restaurants of all genres, it has nice park that can walk or run in mornings and rooms are comfortable in home country style (not the usual cookie cutter large hotel approach) and breakfast is good quality with many choices.",4,2016,10,01
213,Pleasant stay,"My clients booked me into this hotel and I was very pleased.  It had a very pleasant atmosphere.  It looked like there was a lovely bar and restaurant there, although I didn't sample these.  I happily recommend.

",5,2016,09,30
213,A bit dated,A beautiful location with huge lobby. The rooms are dated however. Beds are comfortable but pillows flat. Breakfast basic. Nothing special. Hard to find the right temperature in the room. Paint peeling in parts of the washroom. Would pick a different Hotel when I return to Dublin,3,2016,09,30
213,Room 501 noise from generator terrible,I was allocated Room 501 - it is obviously near to a generator or other equipment making considerable  noise ?? noise was present until 11.30pm and recommenced at 4am - Reception said there was no other Room available and that I had been upgraded ?? -  I got no sleep so a terrible experience in a beautifully located Hotel,1,2016,09,30
213,Peacefull,"Visited on a business trip and this hotel offers a calm and peaceful stay. It's a little way from the centre of town but local bars and restaurants are very good. Hotel bar is open very late, but drinks are a bit pricey.
Staff are all polite and friendly, rooms well appointed with a great Nestpresso machine. I would happily stay again.",4,2016,09,29
213,Very Nice Hotel!,"We stayed here for two nights as part of a tour of Ireland.  The hotel is very nice, in the lines of a boutique hotel.  The rooms were larger than we expected and well appointed.  The room had a mini-fridge, safe, iron and ironing board.  Its location is a little out of the way from downtown Dublin but, this is nice in that it was quiet and not crowded.  We would recommend this hotel to freinds.",4,2016,09,29
213,Business Trip,Well located hotel. the service is very friendly. I had a very nice room overlooking the park. The hotel lobby is very inviting and it also has a great bar. It has several meeting rooms from my view ideal for business and leisure. ,5,2016,09,29
213,business trip,"the hotel was lovely, really helpful staff ,after a busy day it was nice to come back to a welcoming hotel. The coffee machine in the room was a nice extra and the food was better than expected. will stay here again when back in Dublin",4,2016,09,29
213,Value with great location,"Next door to RDS great breakfast spacious quite room . Next door to Kites , Rolys safe classy area. Near Aviva . Sandymount strand and within 20 min walk to city centre. Beautiful park on doorstep herbert . What more can you ask for!",5,2016,09,28
213,Ireland tour," This was our first night in Ireland and the accommodations were wonderful. The bed was excellent. It was close to everything we needed to get to. The staff was outstanding. The breakfast was great as well as the dinner. We would definitely return ",5,2016,09,28
213,Our stay,"Lovely hotel, friendly and efficient staff( especially the very friendly and helpful receptionist)great location, bathroom could do with a little TLC. Starting to look a bit worn. Overall, would stay again. ",5,2016,09,28
213,1000 Times Better than Bewleys,Great location for the RDS and Dublin. Great surrounding restaurants. Staff were very accommodating and the hotel itself was clean and comfortable. The food was seriously a good surprise. I had room service twice and it was excellent. We took 19 staff for dinner. Food and presentation was of an extremely high standard. Overall a really good experience. ,4,2016,09,28
213,Very good value,"I stayed for one night on business. The rooms are large, light and very well appointed. The linen is of good quality and everything is well maintained. 
A minor complaint is that the stock of tea and coffee is limited; it's a small thing, but doesn't cost much to fix.
The common areas are good, if a little bit soulless. The staff are all very warm, helpful and positive.
One great bonus is having a lovely park right on the doorstep. ",4,2016,09,28
213,Excellent stay in a great location,"Great location for a weekend in Dublin. Very pleasant staff and lovely atmosphere in the bar. Very comfortable, spacious room with top quality coffee machine in the room! Car park a little pricey for residents at €12.",5,2016,09,26
213,Excellent accommodations.,Rooms were beautiful and well appointed.  Staff was more than friendly and helpful.  Food was delicious. Locations was perfect and we were pleased that C.I.E. Tours had selected this hotel as part of our tour package.,5,2016,09,26
213,Quiet location but great hotel.,"This hotel is about a twenty minute stroll from Ballsbridge to the city centre, but this has the advantage of nightly quiet which aids a good nights sleep. It is extremely clean and the rooms are of good size. The bar area is good for a pre dinner drink and the breakfast is very varied and of good quality. All in all an easy recommendation.",5,2016,09,26
213,Excellent value in well run friendly hotel,"I was very impressed by the friendliness and helpfulness of staff. Our waiting staff were particularly friendly but the desk staff and porters were also faultless. Generous portions of bar food....it was a very busy weekend in Dublin and this was good value and an excellent location. Room was grand, the coffee machine was a nice touch though as we had a small baby a kettle would have been useful. I'm sure if we had asked it would have been provided as the cot we requested was there - along with blankets suitable for a baby (many hotels are not aware that infants need blankets with little holes in them for safety!) The waiting staff were particularly charming and good fun (though discreet also). I imagine if you were travelling alone the bar would be a welcoming spot also, staff made conversation though there were also lots of small groups on this occasion. The bar was very nicely designed - very inviting. We are familiar with the area  and this is an excellent location, beside a park,  the RDS, Aviva, small shops, restaurants, walkable to the beach and on a frequent bus route that will have you in town in five minutes. This hotel is better value than others nearby and not so nearby but is comparable in quality (and has the best service I have seen in a long time- the staff seem to find joy in their work- somebody is doing a very good job managing them!)",5,2016,09,26
213,Ireland 2016,"Not sure that we got a good price for an extra night we added on. Seemed high!
Would have been helpful to have more information on buses as we got off at the wrong stops twice, although we thought we had the right information.",5,2016,09,26
213,Good Location,"I would stay here again ONLY for its location. If you are planning to stay here, make sure you carry your own TV & iron box 😂😂 The stay here doesn't come cheap but the hotel does not believe in living up to the tariff. ",3,2016,09,25
213,Pleasant stay. Very helpfull staff,Our stay was very pleasant. The staff tried to accomodate all our wishes during our stay. Both the rooms as the staff and the selection of foods was according to what we expected. I would certainly recommend the Herbert Park.,4,2016,09,25
213,One of the better hotels,"Really couldn't find fault, comfortable beds, quiet and had a great sleep. Location was perfect for what we wanted. Food was great. Staff friendly and the place was spotless, will gladly stay here again.",5,2016,09,24

213,"great rooms, but not very clean.",what to say about this one? it reminds me of a place for old people. the breakfast buffet was good but like very often there are two problems here. the scambled eggs look and taste like yellow pudding (I you don't want to know how this is actually made in the kitchen) and the bacon is usually burned or dry like a piece of leather. same in this hotel. my bathroom was not cleaned properly.,3,2016,09,23
213,fantastc,"Really lovely helpful friendly staff. Great room service .beautiful park behind hotel, walking easy right into city centre great location. Highly recommend it and will definitely stay there again in back in beautiful Dublin.",5,2016,09,23
213,Disappointed,"I stayed for 2 nights room only and found the cost expensive!  €455 Staff are friendly on arrival. Was charged an extra 150€ for a coffee spillage. The money was debited from my account without any prior knowledge or authorisation.  I requested a copy of receipt for the cost of cleaning carpet I have yet to receive same. 
Very poor communication and practices ",3,2016,09,22
213,a good stay,"I was at a meeting at the DSC very close to the hotel and so the location was perfect.  It had a couple of pubs close by where we could have a nice time at night and a walking distance to the center of Dublin (40 min walk), we love to walk so we had a chance to move around.  The hotel is clean, with good space and the rooms are confortable",4,2016,09,21
213,Excellent Hotel and Staff!,We stayed 2 nights at the Herbert Park Hotel.  It is beautiful and top-notch. Great location.  Goran took excellent care of us while we were there.  I HIGHLY recommend this hotel.  Be sure to ask for Goran!,5,2016,09,21
213,Herbert Park Dublin,"I am a regular visitor to the Herbert  Park Hotel and on this most recent trip,was not surprised to find the staff were as always,friendly,efficient and professional.A well made cocktail and supper in the bar was excellent...Hard to beat this hotel for location,price and friendly staff.",5,2016,09,21
213,Great Place in Dublin,"We were on the home stretch of our vacation and were recommended the Herbert Park. As we had stayed elsewhere at the beginning of our trip, at first the Herbert seemed further out and less convenient; but, once we got our bearings, it was just what we needed and there were plenty of ways to get where we needed to go. The hotel is clean, friendly and I would recommend it if you are looking for a nice hotel in Dublin.",4,2016,09,20
213,calm and professional business hotel,"I spent 3 nights on business. The room was relatively spacious, a bottle of water, Nespresso machine and free WLAN. Although it is not far from the city centre it was very quiet in the room.
Breakfast buffet with good choice.
If you get hungry you'll find an indian, thai and a burger grill right round the corner - they are not a bargain, though. You might as well just stay in the hotel and enjoy the food there - prices are more or less the same.",4,2016,09,20
213,Lunch ,"We held a two day conference meeting at the hotel, and broke off for lunch in the dining room both days. Dragmora and Jan took care of us and the service was extremely efficient. We ordered 15 mins before leaving the conference room and the food was on the table when we arrived. It was just what we wanted. ",5,2016,09,19
213,Great experience,We stayed at this hotel for 2 nights.Had a wonderful experience with staff.Amenities good.Lot of restaurants around.quiet elite surroundings.Breakfast was also good..Helpful n courteous staff.Ambience was great.,5,2016,09,19

We will be booking next year and also be telling our friends about this hotel ",5,2016,09,19
213,Not happy.,Though the cost of my room and that of my senior colleage's suite could both have been charged to the company credit card used to secure both reservations the hotel insisted I pay for my room and that of my already departed colleague as well on my personal cedit card. This soon maxed out my card shortly afterwards and created issues for me later in the day. Not great!!,3,2016,09,19
213,One night stay,"Lovely hotel, great staff and nice food. The rooms were very clean and of a reasonable size. We would definitely use this hotel again in the future. The hotel is only 30 minutes walk from the main city centre if you don't want to get a taxi. The staff in the hotel bar were exceptionally friendly and made us feel very welcome.",5,2016,09,19

i also like the mini coffee bar in the room very much.  :-)
i pay 180 eruo per night. single room, maybe somehow too small.",5,2016,09,18
213,Your ordinary business hotel,Good sized rooms offering everything a business hotel usually offers (plus a nespresso coffee machine). There is free wifi and breakfast is good. Location is not that good though as it is far from the city center and the touristic areas and you need a taxi unless you are willng to walk for at least 25 minutes. Apart from that everything else is ok.,4,2016,09,18
213,Disappointed with room facilities and amenities,Chose the Herbert Park Hotel for proximity to office. Aircon broken for entire stay. Shaver socket also broken since the last time i stayed in room 410. No real attempt made to rectify either issue. Bathroom amenities are very poor. Fourth stay this year and I will likely chose Intercon next time as you get more value for money and better service.,3,2016,09,18
213,Great Place,I had low expectations when this hotel was recommended based on being across the street from my client. I was pleasantly surprised. The hotel is great. The restaurant and its staff are great. I will return. ,5,2016,09,17
213,Nice hotel with helpful staff,"Herbert Park Hotel was more directed toward business travelers than others in which we stayed on our CIE tour of Ireland, but it was just as pleasant, attractive and comfortable as hoped for, and the staff was extremely efficient, helpful and friendly.  Our room was comfortable, clean and well appointed, and the breakfast was the wonderful ""Full Irish"" bountiful buffet that we quickly became accustomed to during our travels in Ireland.  The adjoining Herbert Park was lovely!",5,2016,09,17
213,"Nice hotel, great staff","We found the hotel to be very nice and the staff were very friendly and helpful.  Gerard at the front desk in particular helped us several times, arranging taxis, answering questions and giving directions.  The breakfast buffet was very nice and had good choices, they even had a honeycomb of honey for topping pancakes.  The hotel is about a 25-30 minute walk to Dublin or a quick taxi ride.  Herbert Park was also an enjoyable walk much like our state's Metro parks.  Overall a nice stay.",4,2016,09,17
213,Short stay,"Great service from the reception staff when checking in and checking out. The rooms were a little dated but were very clean. Good selection at breakfast, and good service at the bar. Didn't use any of the other facilities.",4,2016,09,17
213,Nice hotel,"Partner was staying due to an event at the RDC so in terms of his needs it was spot on.. Right next door. In terms of getting into central Dublin there is 2 regular bus services which run outside and it takes about 15 mins. Taxis are also plentiful and cheap. The airport bus also stood outside and the hotel offer a great taxi rate for your return trip to the airport. 
The hotel itself is clean and comfortable. Rooms are furnished nicely and the bed is comfy. Great shower too. ",3,2016,09,17
213,"Nice Hotel, great location.","Nice hotel, good location. Clean areas  and friendly staff. A good breakfast but don't be late as its cleaned down promptly. Check in and check out service was very good and Breakfast service staff were cheerful and efficient. ",4,2016,09,16
213,Home comfort in the perfect location,"As always my stay at Herbert Park is a pleasure. The staff whether at Reception, the dining room or throughout the property make my stay pleasant and enjoyable. The rooms are always perfect, love the addition of the Nespresso machine. Breakfast is grand - I particularly like the choice of fruit which is always wonderful. Everything about my stay is excellent, I cannot find any fault. Love a stroll in Herbert Park on a fine day.",5,2016,09,16
213,Conference,"We held a day long meeting at the Herbert Park Hotel.
The hotel is very pleasing on the eye and comfortable.  Adam and James were most helpful with all our needs for the meeting. Adam made sure we had our wifi connection and made sure refreshments were on time and organised. James went out of his way to help in any way he could",4,2016,09,14
213,Quick City Break,"Stayed here on a spur of the moment trip to Dublin, to attend an event in the RDS. The proximity to the RDS is excellent. It's also within walking distance of the city centre, if you want to venture further afield.

The room itself is gorgeous, with a complimentary Nespresso Machine, with was a very nice, unexpected touch. There is also a mini bar in the room - didn't touch this though. The airconditioning in the room was great - not something you need too  often in Ireland!

We only had breakfast in the hotel, this was delicious, if a little overpriced. We did have one drink in the bar, and found it to be a very relaxed atmosphere.

Be careful when driving in though, Google Maps brought us around to the side of the hotel - the entrance to the carpark is on the Anglesea Road, and if you go the wrong way, it's a long detour to get back around.",4,2016,09,14
213,Wonderful stay,We had a wonderful stay in the Herbert Park - the staff were exceptionally nice.  We will be back again!  The restaurant and breakfast was very good.  The room was spacious and spotless.  We would recommend this hotel.,5,2016,09,14
213,Great location and friendly staff,"Very nice location within pleasant walk of many parts of Dublin, and next to lovely Herbert  Park.  Very friendly staff. And good price. Only comment would be to advise guests re the plug in points, which are on the side of the USB input slots, took us a few minutes to find!! Otherwise perfect thank you",5,2016,09,14
213,Classy Joint!,"A nice place to be - the staff really do engage and are helpful and friendly, one and all. Understated, stylish rooms and a pleasant foyer area. Didn't eat there so can't comment on the food. Definitely recommended. ",5,2016,09,13
213,Herbert Park Hotel stay,The property was clean and orderly.  They have a wonderful seat/greet area centrally located and convenient to the bar area.  The food served at the buffet was very good and appealing.  The room was kept clean and orderly.  The halls were quiet during the evenings.  Taxi service was very convenient and quick to respond.,5,2016,09,13
213,OVER PRICED AND LACKING ANY ATMOSPHERE,"We booked this hotel for its location -as there are several good local restaurants, parks and pubs and only 25 minutes walk in to city centre . The hotel is clean, but decor overly minimalist bordering on being spartan. Given it is meant to be a 4 star hotel one would expect more than one small bar of soap, 1 shampoo/conditioner & 1 --especially for a couple! There was an expresso machine in the room, which made barely drinkable coffee but of course useless for tea, as water just luke warm. When we requested a kettle we were told by a reception (""Michael"") that ""4 star hotels don't bother with kettles.....and anyway you can request hot water from the kitchen""......I feel that this response was both incorrect and facetious, as we have stayed in many  other 4 & 5 star hotel and been provided with a kettle when we have requested one.......requesting hot water from the kitchen is hardly convenient or appropriate whenever you feel like a decent cup of tea! Be careful not to run out of toiletries towels early on Sunday morning as I was told that housekeeping staff do not start work until 0930 hours!

Most of the staff do seem try their best but have virtually no or very limited knowledge of the local area or its facilities. 

I would strongly recommend an excellent cafe/fGrill/fish and chip shop across the road however called the Embassy Grill which has been there for over 50 years ----delightfully helpful and engaging staff ------ amazing fish and chips!

Overall we feel that this hotel is over priced and lacks any kind of atmosphere.
",3,2016,09,13
213,Herbert Park Hotel is TOP !,"For our last night in Ireland, we booked the Fabulous Package in the Herbert Park Hotel : Service (free parking !), food and room were excellent. Emptying the bottle of prosecco we got offered was a very nice way to end our holiday.",5,2016,09,13
213,Disappointed,I was very disappointed.  Too expensive for value. Very far outside of town. The booking agency said it was within walking distance of central attractions in Dublin. It was not. The airporter dropped us off so very far from the hotel. We were exhausted dragging suitcases . Why is there not a direct drop off as we were told?,1,2016,09,12
213,Perfect weekend break,First visit and will definitely return. Excellent hotel in great location - various restaurants /bars surrounding without the biz of the city centre. Staff all extremely friendly with nothing too much trouble. Rooms excellent particularly if you can view over Herbert park. Breakfast excellent - particularly the fresh honey - but you need to sort the scrambled eggs ... Def worth a visit,5,2016,09,12
213,car park setback.," very enjoyable stay in the Herbert Park . the whole ambiance of the hotel was uplifting . However, as I was reversing my car from parking space in car park, I hit a pillar and damaged my wing mirror and slightly dented the door !   Undoubtly , this will cost much more to repair  than my hotel costs!",5,2016,09,12
213,a pleasure to stay at the herbert,"We had a brilliant stay in the Herbert. Everything is 5 star. The room was unbelievable, we stayed in the Park View Suite. Thanks for a memorable weekend. We were attending the races in Leopardstown and the whole weekend for first class",5,2016,09,12
213,Great Hotel - pity about the food!,"I have stayed here numerous times for both business and pleasure and the location and quality of the hotel is top class - particularly the newly renovated rooms. However the breakfast quality is poor -particularly the meats. The sausage and bacon are of a very cheap standard and not befitting the prospect of a ""Full Irish""! The lobby could do with some background music too - particularly at night time in the bar area. Only trying to be objectively critical - that's all. Would certainly recommend it though.",4,2016,09,12
213,Good option ,"I just spent two very comfortable nights at Herbert Park Hotel, well appointed rooms with excellent shower, nepresso machine with supplied pods, two free bottles of water per night. Bed was very conducive to a goods night sleep. Prices at in-house restaurant are very fair, food quality is excellent, breakfast buffet is very good.  The staff is also very courteous and efficient, I would definitely stay here again!

Easy access to American Embassy, shops, park, pubs and fine dining. 
I would highly recommend trying the smoked fish and chips at the Embassy grill a short walk from hotel, not fancy, but outstanding.",5,2016,09,11

Herbert Park is on your doorstep so you can stroll through the park over to Donnybrook ",4,2016,09,10
213,Very successful customer conference,"My company selected the Herbert Park Hotel for a customer conference event after reviewing several hotels in the area. We are extremely satisfied with our choice.

The staff were efficient, friendly, and extremely helpful. Everything that happened ""behind the scenes"" of the conference ran like clockwork.

The facilities were excellent and while we brought a lot of equipment with us as part of the conference, the hotel was more than capable of providing adequate facilities for all that we required.

We struggled with the air-conditioning in one of the rooms but it certainly did not ruin the event.

Our customers were highly impressed with the venue and we would certainly recommend the Herbert Park Hotel for business events and we will be back again.

Overall, a very efficient and professional service.",5,2016,09,09
213,"Herbert Park Hotel, Dublin","An all around excellent experience. Would highly recommend this hotel. Usually hotels are either professional or friendly but not both. At the Herbert Park Hotel, you get the best of both worlds in a  great location.",5,2016,09,09

213,Herbert Park,"All was great ! Are looking forward booking it again ! 😊
The only disappointment was - the polystyrene pillows ! Must change it to the goose feathers especially for the executive rooms that's the only quite disappointing thing because the good sleep in the hotel bed is a very important thing ! 😊",5,2016,09,07
213,Ireland,"Spent the last night of our 8 day coach tour here.  Very modern, clean hotel.  Nice area, but a distance from City and sights.  Found the elevators good as you must use your room key to access your floor, nice security feature.",5,2016,09,07
213,worst nights stay in a 4* hotel in years,"I had the worst nights sleep in a 4* hotel in years, cant believe they offer guests a room that is flanked by buzzing air conditioning units the buzz all night ! & only supply cheap foam pillows, but spend money on an expensive Nespresso coffee maker in the room !",1,2016,09,07
213,Dublin gem,"I loved this hotel. Beautiful hotel in Dublin. Staff was exceptional! Room was great as was the food and drinks. If I make it back to Dublin I know I'll be staying there! The hotel is a few blocks from the heart of Dublin, but easy walkable. ",5,2016,09,06
213,"Great location, friendly and helpful staff.","The hotel is everything one would expect from a four star rating and I had a very pleasant stay. Breakfast is overpriced at about €17 for a continental breakfast and only a €2 difference between that and a full Irish, but that's the case in many hotels now. ",4,2016,09,06
213,Watch out,"Difficult to work with.  Booked 3 nights - then plans changed and had to leave next morning. At checkout, Hotel refused to cancel third night without charging for third night.

213,Very enjoyable stay,"Excellent hotel, very modern & comfortable. Pleasant & very accommodating staff, spotless rooms, air conditioning, tasty breakfast.

213,Good conference atmosphere,The whole hotel was well equipped to manage the conference. There was a good combination between offered rooms and food during this period. The park beside helped to stay fit during the visit but this is always a mater of how the weather is.,4,2016,09,05
213,Overpriced!,Overpriced hotel selling rooms that  are not worth the money. Staff clearly not bothered! They are busy enough so it's a take it or leave it attitude which is fine but I will certainly never be back or recommending,1,2016,09,05

The food was excellent and the Nespresso machine at the room a very nice topic to feel at home. Room WiFi can be improve in regards of admin and login process.  ,5,2016,09,05
213,Excellent hotel!,"This hotel is excellent. Very clean, the staff is friendly, the food is tasty (especially the breakfast buffet!), the A/C works great, and the check in and out process is fast and easy. My only request is an easy way to get a bucket of ice. I'm an American and I know lots of ice is very much an American thing, but if they had an ice machine, that would put this hotel over the top since basically no hotel in Europe has an ice machine.",5,2016,09,04

213,Great location and very comfortable,The hotel is in a great location - right next to a beautiful park with a direct bus line to the city centre close by. Pubs and restaurants nearby are of good quality too. The room and facilities are very comfortable and the staff super helpful.,5,2016,09,04
213,"William Crellin, Jr.","all was good, several nights were priced at ~ 250 euro.  I felt that was excessive, 150 euros is more in line with other nice Dublin hotels.  Room was clean & quiet, staff was always cordial & helpful.  The location is great, close to the DART, easy taxi access, lots of pubs nearby",4,2016,09,04
213,Very business focused,"It did the job as we were only here for one night but for €185 a night excluding breakfast for a tiny single room which had scrapes all down the wall and skirting boards damaged I was not that impressed

Anyway it was comfortable and quiet so that helped, overall a bland hotel with nothing setting it aside From other similar venues",3,2016,09,04
213,Everything was good,The only place we have stayed in Ireland to have a coffee machine in the room and it was very good (this is a typical thing in the states) the mini fridge was also nice and seems to be a Rare thing in hotels in ireland. the rooms where clean and the staff was helpful. ,5,2016,09,03
213,Very nice hotel,"We stayed here at the start of our Ireland vacation. Jet lagged after flying LA to Dublin, we were happy to have king sized bed, bathroom much larger than most NYC hotels, nice staff.  Hotel is next to American embassy in an upscale area.  About 1.5 miles to city center,front desk was helpful with bus instructions.  We walked back from town and easy walk.  Good pubs and low key restaurants near hotel. Nespresso machine in room.
We did not take breakfast option , but instead stopped at corner spot that is open until 1030p offering B,L,D and coffee, pastry takeaway.",5,2016,09,03
213,One of Dublins best,"I have stayed at this Hotel many times and always find the same excellent service

Extra bonus to the staff .they're very cooperative and trustfuly. 
Fantastic park and garden.
Definitely you will enjoy your time. 
I really recommend this hotel. 
",5,2016,09,01
213,Perfect Location,"We stayed here while in Dublin for the weekend, it was perfectly situated a few miles from the city among nice restaurants and cool bars. Only a 5-10 minute taxi ride to the city (€8)

Really comfy beds and super clean. The staff were really friendly and very helpful.",4,2016,08,31
213,Excellent Hotel !,"I stayed in this hotel because it was close to my work location.  The staff was extremely helpful, be it providing directions or delivering an iron to my room.  It was walking distance to downtown but has a close bus stop as well.  Food options in and around the hotel were great.  ",5,2016,08,30
213,Margaret,"I was a member of a business group on a company night out. We all agreed that the staff were Vvery friendly, courteous and helpful. Also bed s very comfortable, so had a good night's sleep. Ticked all my boxes.",4,2016,08,30
213,Great Hotel - Beds are Poor,"This was my third (and last) stay at the Herbert Park hotel. Each time I have stayed my double/king sized bed has actually been two smaller mattresses pushed together with a single sheet over the two. In the case of my first visit it was two single beds pushed together with two single sheets and two single duvets. While the idea sounds fine, waking in the middle of the night in the crack between the two mattresses isn't. Part of this is my fault - I should have let the hotel know at the time but as it was for business and only one night I didn't feel there was much point. It's really not something I'd expect of a hotel of this calibre - everything else about the hotel is great. Staff are lovely, rooms are spotless (as are the beds) and location is ok for getting to Dublin City Centre (about a ten minute taxi ride to Stephen's Green). The only thing stopping me from staying here again are the pushed together beds - if it wasn't for that I'd be back in a heartbeat.",3,2016,08,30
213,Amazing staff,"Herbert Park hotel is ideally located and provides an excellent base to see the sights of Dublin, go shopping and just chill out in beautiful surroundings. The staff are amazing and they provide an excellent customer service. Staff in the restaurant were very attentive remembering us from our previous visit. As we were celebrating our anniversary they produced a beautiful desert with a candle and message written in chocolate wishing us a happy anniversary. A very special touch and very much appreciated so thank you Goran we had a great time.",5,2016,08,29
213,Satisfied,Everything we needed - for a meeting with 30 people - was there and worked perfectly. The staff was very friendly and helpful and quick when anything was needed. There was nothing to complain about. Would use the facility again.,5,2016,08,29
213,Very enjoyable trip,"i was in Dublin on business, working predominately around Ballsbridge so I thought I'd stay at the Hetbett Park.  It was slightly pricy - but it was August! - however food, comfort, staff etc were first class",5,2016,08,29
213,Great Dublin hotel!,"A great hotel overall! I loved my room, and all the facilities. Cool restaurant (although a little bit inferior to other luxury hotels) and a great bar. My room had a complimentary nespresso machine, which was great!
The location is nice, and you can either grab a taxi or a bus (the stop is around the corner to get to the center of the city).
Be careful if you are arriving by coach or larger vehicle, since the street in front of thew hotel apparently has a ""weight restriction"", which the staff failed to mention in advance...
Other than that a good experience.",3,2016,08,29
213,Decent business stay a bit too expensive,"The hotel is not very design, but the location is nice, staff is friendly. And it's clean and decent. Didn't try any of the facilities of food. It could use a bit of renovation. It's a bit expensive for what it is. It's nice for running and it's close to the center. 
",3,2016,08,28
213,Lovely stay!,"Hard to find any flaws really. Perfect stay. I especially enjoy the huge bed and the breakfast is really good too, Staff is very nice and professional, more than willing to assist in any way possible. Swift check-in/out, and a lovely park nearby.",5,2016,08,28
213,"Very nice hotel, very clean!","We enjoyed s very nice king bed room with city view after a long travel day.  Beds were very comfortable and got good night's sleep.

Ate dinner in Taste restaurant in the lobby.  Food very good, service a bit slow.  15 minutes to get s Guinness on a slow night.

Breakfast was excellent!

Desk staff very nice and helpful.

American travelers will need converter for electrical appliances (230volt).  Free wifi, fast!  USB chargers on desk.

Can't comment on value as we were part of a tour group.

",4,2016,08,28
213,"Great location, friendly staff and good food.","Modern, bright and clean hotel with easy access into city as the hotel is on a main bus route. Breakfast/restaurant has a bright airy feel as it is looking out onto Herbert Park. Underground carpark with reasonable rates. High quality food nicely presented. Altogether a very satisfactory experience, would definitely book this hotel again. However as usual a lone traveller is penalised by having to pay for two people!!!!",5,2016,08,28
213,Nice Hotel,"Stayed here for two nights in July.  
Check-in / out were shift.  Efficient and friendly staff.
Very clean and Comfortable rooms.
Had a lovely coffee machine in bedroom which my husband was delighted with.

The location of this hotel is good for business or leisure trips.
They are a number of good bars and restaurants right on the door step.
And only a short walk into the city centre.  However if you don't fancy walking there is a bus stop just down the street and plenty of taxis passing. 
A taxi for two to St Stephens Green cost us just €7 one evening - so I found this to be very good value.  
There is also Herbert Park just around the corner should you wish to stretch your legs or  get some fresh air
The bar here is lovely and relaxing with large sofa's and comfortable.  However, it lacks atmosphere.  Lovely cocktail menu.

Can't comment on breakfast as we eat out each morning.
Parking was an additional 12€ per night.
Not cheap to stay but you get what you pay for.
Would stay here again.",4,2016,08,27
213,Excellent stay,Great location - this was about a 2 minute walk from work and about a 20 minute walk from City Centre.  Staff was extremely helpful and kind.  Breakfast was very nice and room was quiet and comfortable.  Highly recommend for business or leisure travel.,5,2016,08,27
213,Smashing,"loved it....especially being upgraded on check in. location was perfect. near to plenty pubs and restaurants plus reasonable walking distance to office (35 to 40 minutes) and city centre (30 minutes). staff typical of a Dublin hotel, just grand ",5,2016,08,26
213,"Functional, clean,good location, terrible coffee","The hotel is in a nice part of town with some bars and restaurants within walking distance, also there is a small supermarket nearby if you want to avoid paying the silly in-room prices for drinks (and they were very silly).  All clean and functional, toiletries in bathroom room were a bit basic and the breakfast coffee was dire and if you wanted something better you had to pay for it.  Odd that in 2016 a hotel cannot bring itself to make a cappuccino for someone without fleecing them for more money.  Staff were helpful but not overly friendly, the usual scattering of slightly surly Eastern Europeans but they got the job done.  If I had to stay there again for business I would, but I probably wouldn't choose it for leisure purposes.  ",3,2016,08,26
213,Nice hotel,"I stayed for business for 5 nights. Breakfast was excellent and the hotel is very close to RDS. Easy to vget to the city center, even by bus or walking (30 min). Very clean and beautiful hotel. The bottled water in the night stand every day a nice detail.",4,2016,08,26
213,Excellent Hotel and very friendly staff,"Excellent Hotel and very friendly staff. I highly recommend this nice Hotel. Location (just 20 minutes walking to the city center), staff, breakfast and services are very good. I was attending a Conference at the Royal Dublin Society, only 5 minutes from the Hotel.",5,2016,08,26
213,Herbert Park Hotel Stay was Excellent,"We arrived around 10 in the morning expecting to have to leave our bags with the desk before heading out for the day. We were thrilled to hear our room was ready. We settled in before going for a walk in the beautiful park right next to the hotel. It's only a short walk to restaurants, pubs and little shops. A longer walk to the city but very doable. Plenty of public transportation available. The staff was absolutely wonderful.",5,2016,08,24
213,Surprising value at Premium location,"We recently stayed overnight at this hotel August 2016, having found a great rate online. The reception staff are polite professional and friendly, as were all other staff we met at the bar, cafe and in the rooms. The lobby and open plan bar cafe are well designed and bright and airy, the rooms are a little older in style but very comfortable, quiet and have air conditioning and a Nespresso machine! I would previously have expected this hotel to be very expensive, and it feels that way, but on the night of our booking any Jury's style hotel was far more per night. I would certainly consider this option first in future. Though it is outside of the city centre, It is close to many local bars and restaurants but this time we opted to eat at the hotel.They offer a la carte at the restaurant and a day and evening menu in the bar area with a good selection. The presentation is fun, the portions are generous and the pricing is good. If you are looking for a hen/stag venue, this is not the place for you, but for a quite and sophisticated option on business or vacation this is perfect.",5,2016,08,24
213,Bland,I chose this place because of its location and ability to park outside beside it. The hotel was clean and tidy but bland and over priced for what it was. 448 Euros for two nights is not great value especially as I had no breakfast or anything to eat at all during the 2 days. ,2,2016,08,24
213,I Love Herbert Park!,"My wife and I always stay at the Herbert Park when visiting Dublin for 2 days or more, and have been doing so for many years now. Aside from the great location, the whole ambiance of the place provides a relaxing and enjoyable experience. All rooms are tastefully decorated and furnished, facilities are first class, staff are extremely friendly.",5,2016,08,24
213,Herbert Park Hotel,"Had a free upgrade to the executive room. Very nice room, but not as modern/new décor as other 4 star hotels (outside of Ireland). Cannot compare with other hotels in Ireland as this was a first trip. Staff are excellent. Room was clean. Price was on the high side, but typical for the area. Location is very convenient to RDS, but tourist sites are further away. Would recommend for business.",5,2016,08,24
213,Peaceful location in Dublin,"The hotel is not part of a chain and really feels like it has its own unique identity. Spotlessly clean and airy with really friendly staff. It is expensive though, priced more like a five than a four star hotel. ",4,2016,08,24
213,/,"the staff is kind and considerate.
the rooms are large and bedding is excellent
The breakfasts  are hearty and excellent.
The hotel is very well placed to visit Dublin.
The value for money is very satisfying for the category of 4-star hotel

",5,2016,08,23
213,One night only,"Very friendly staff, good location,  room service good & food ok but the price for a room was very high & I certainly do not think it was worth the price as it was only a one night stay. We have no idea whether there was a gym or swimming pool.",4,2016,08,23
213,Great Stay in Dublin,"This hotel was great.  It had been recommended by the business we were visiting and it turned out to be a great recommendation.  As a walker, I took advantage of the proximity to the downtown core (20 minutes) and toured the area when not working.  Great service by all of the hotel staff and extremely friendly and accommodating.  ",5,2016,08,22
213,First trip to Dublin,"Our first trip to Dublin was so enjoyable with the additional factor of such a superb hotel. Nothing too much trouble for any of the staff,  convenience comfortable and very clean. Would definitely return. ",4,2016,08,22
213,Lovely stay in Dublin,"This hotel was fantastic. It is modern, well supplied and the staff is on par with the hotel rating. The breakfast was worth waking up. The wifi is fast as far as hotel wifi go. The hotel is about 30 minutes walk from the city center, but is surrounded by some great restaurants and made it easy for us to get on and off the highway. Would stay again.",5,2016,08,21
213,Capital City Visits,"Best hotel I have stayed at in Dublin. Lovely rooms, great staff and very clean. It's a little out of the City but we walked in so can't be that bad. Buses stop just up the road, you require the No4 or 7 to City centre. A few bars and restaurants close by as well. ",5,2016,08,21
213,Friendliness in dublin,"Staff at Herbert Park hotel are extremely friendly & helpful,especially Evelyn in Accommodation & Egle, manager. They looked after us extremely well on our visit. The hotel is excellently located & very clean & served some ",5,2016,08,20
213,Good value. Off peak.,"Stay here periodically. Very good hotel, does what it says on the tin. 
Upgrade and smooth check in and out with Michael on reception.
Would stay here more often but can be really expensive at certain times.",5,2016,08,20
213,Execllent on almost all counts,"Excellent hotel in a great location with very friendly and attentive staff.
Rooms were spotless and well appointed.
The only let down was the breakfast, there was plenty of choice but it was not particularly nice.",4,2016,08,20
213,Hip Herbert,"Great place for a quiet, relaxing break.
Ease of access to Dublin central.
Staff efficient, thorough and courteous.
Breakfast very fresh and wide choice.
Very tasty menu available in the Pavilion restaurant.
",5,2016,08,19
213,not so bad,"quite location,  even if not so close to the center of the city (on foot); Breakfast varied and plentiful. Unfortunately, the view from the room assigned was a wall and satellite dishes. Very spacious lobby with 2 employees at the opening of the front door",4,2016,08,19
213,EXCELLENT HOTEL,"cleanliness and hygiene are maintained to the highest standard.  a serene atmosphere, lots of space, peace.  this hotel is for anyone enjoys quiet time following a day in the city.  the dining area is very beautiful, the food is excellent, and the staff are subtle and mannerly, and human.  high recommended.",5,2016,08,19
213,Return trip,"Return trip
Great hotel and excellent location
Beside Herbert park and lake which are lovely for a walk
Good restaurants nearby

Do suggest that returning visitors would not have to pay for carparking",4,2016,08,19
213,Excellent,"On are arrival we were upgraded to an executive room, We found the staff very nice and helpful especially the young blonde waitress that served us breakfast on the terrace during our stay. All round great stay, will definitely be back.",5,2016,08,19
213,A Well designed hotel,"Very spacious well designed building. A 40 min walk brings you into city centre. The highlight was the fantastic coffee machine in the bedroom. The bar staff were courteous and efficient. 
The staff on the front desk were too brusque and business like . Lacked Irish charm. 
I also feel that hotel carparking is too expensive. 
Continental breakfast was also overpriced. 
Everything else in the hotel was excellent. ",4,2016,08,18
213,First class hotel,"An excellent hotel perfectly located for exploring Dublin but away from the busy city centre.  The staff were most attentive, our room spotless and beautifully furnished.  A wide choice of menus in the Pavillion Restaurant and Terrace Lounge.",5,2016,08,18
213,Unfriendly staff,"Needs to understand customer service to better meet the needs of the customer . The front desk could bbe a little more helpful in providing suggestions and tips and tricks for sight seeing.        
It's a nice hotel but the service could improve",4,2016,08,17
213,Satisfaction,"I was very impressed for the staff, the competence, the kindness. food is great, everybody is very speed to do things. The location is beautiful, there is a wonderful park beside Herbert Park very relaxing and an amazing swan's lake. Enjoy your stay!",5,2016,08,16
213,Very comfortable hotel in a very convenient location,"The Herbert Park Hotel is situated in one of the most fashionable (and expensive) parts of Dublin. The entrance hall is a large 'atrium' that is open-plan and marble floored - it may not be to everyone's taste.
The rooms are very clean and very comfortable. Reception staff were prompt, welcoming and friendly.
Breakfast was very very good, with lots of fresh products served in imaginative ways. waiting staff were friendly and attentive.
Parking is a little expensive at €12 per night and many rooms overlook the kitchen / offices (inevitable in a city centre location) but there is a very pretty park overlooked by the restaurant.",5,2016,08,15
213,Welcome back!,"We are always greeted at the Herbert with a welcome and reference to our last visit and also any specific requirements are always known. Staff are friendly and helpful and the Herbert is like ""home from home"" but better service at the Herbert!!  :-). KC",4,2016,08,15

213,Consistently good. ,"I have stayed in this hotel regularly in the past - but haven't been for some time. It's really very good. Check-in is friendly and efficient. The rooms are excellent, spotless and comfortable. Room service breakfast was excellent and abundant. And I spent some time meeting with a friend in the lobby bar for lunch. The food and service were really good. 

The location is an added bonus and this hotel offers brilliant value for money.  

Will definitely be back. ",5,2016,08,13
213,The Herbert park Hotel is top class,"We adore staying at this hotel , from the second you drive into the under ground car park and enter the hotel you know everything is going to perfect. The service is always amazing , the rooms are beautiful and the Food is so good that we never go out to dinner in Dublin ! You would have to eat in this Hotel . 
They do different packages, we get the overnight indulgence ,this is your room with breakfast until 12 o clock in bed and a 2o clock check out . Also 2 glasses of prosecco and appetizers before dinner . 
Really for Dublin city it's the BEST hotel and we have done the leg work .

213,Fantastic,"I stayed here with my partner for a surprise birthday treat for her . Where do I start ?  Check in was brilliant and informative . I had put in a request for a jacuzzi bath and upon arrival was given the choice of either a park view on the third floor or a jacuzzi  bath on the 5th floor. I took the 5th floor option . The room and bathroom was spotless and we'll appointed . I also had asked for a late check out of 2pm normally this costs 2t euro extra. This was unavailable as the hotel was busy I was however given a 1pm check out at no extra cost. Due to my change of room the room did not have bathrobes or slippers so I contacted reception this was dealt with immediately and they were delivered . We also had a plate of complimentary chocolates delivered to the room and they were lovely . The bathroom was as big as a cabin we once had on a cruise ship . This hotel,  the staff the decor the quality and everything else shines through . If you want a break away with quality in a beautiful location with a beautiful park on the doorstep this is the place I would certainly recommend.  I found there were a score of more than 5 I would certainly give this hotel more . Fantastic is the only word I have to describe the experience here. And all I would say is if you can try and get an executive  room . Well were the small supplement. ",5,2016,08,13

However this is not central Dublin and if you want to see those sights it is a short DART train service into the city centre, the nearest station is next to the Aviva Stadium.  Popular business hotel.",4,2016,08,07
213,Short Stay in Dublin,"Very nice and modern hotel. Large rooms, helpful staff and a good breakfast. Next to a large park, ideal for walkers and joggers. Some nice pubs and restaurants within walking distance.

The hotel is a little bit out of central Dublin, a 20 to 30 minute walk, though there is a regular city bus (and hop on hop off) stop close by.",4,2016,08,07
213,Great return visit !,"It had been a few years since my friends and I had been to Dublin for the Horse Show, we were thrilled to get rooms again  at The Herbert Park. We loved everything from the moment we arrived ! We arrived early, but that was no problem for the welcoming staff, we were welcomed like old friends, checked in and they took our luggage and arranged for it to be in our rooms on our return later. Each staff member we met ( including the late bar! )was warm and friendly. Our rooms were excellent , clean  and modern, loved the new coffee machines ! We were sorry we could only stay one night but all agreed we wouldn't stay anywhere else ! Hopefully next year we can stay for a few days.",5,2016,08,06
213,Herbert Park - Brilliant Experience,"Our tour group stayed at the Herbert Park Hotel, next to an historic park in Dublin of the same name; it offers a high-class experience and is reasonably priced.  Rooms are spacious and immaculately clean; service is prompt and courteous; and their restaurant served well-prepared gourmet food at dinner.  Breakfast was a tremendous buffet, with abundant varieties of fresh fruit, meats, pastries & breads, as well as eggs and porridge.  Rooms are smartly laid out with up-to-date amenities like adjustable thermostat and USB ports.  Add to the pluses, the staff is cordial and approachable.  Exceptional hotel!",5,2016,08,06

213,"Excellent stay, always consistent in their service","I used to live in Ballsbridge and used the Herbert Park Hotel for work (rooms and lunches) and whenever we had friends over. Now that we moved, there is no other hotel I would stay at! The rooms are clean and bright (park & entrance side of hotel), the staff (reception, lounge, housekeeping, ...) is very friendly and helpful. The location is great, lots of restaurants, the Dart & bus are close by, the hotel is within a 15-20 min walk from the city. I really recommend staying there, it is a relaxing place.",5,2016,07,31
213,Nice Hotel in a Nice Area,"Large, quiet, clean, comfortable rooms and located on the perimeter of City Center, it was easy to get out of town for my activities to the South.  The staff were friendly and the breakfast was great.  I will definitely stay here again.",5,2016,07,30

213,Stayed here for Dublin Horse Show,"My husband, baby and I stayed here for Dublin Horse Show week. The room was spacious and clean, and they had kindly put a travel cot in for us. There was a mini bar, tv, hairdryer and iron available to use. The bed was very comfy, and the shower was incredibly powerful! The only problem we found was that the shower curtain wasn't enough to stop water going on the bathroom floor!
The staff were all very friendly, helpful and attentive. 
Wonderful breakfast too!
Everywhere in Dublin is more expensive during horse show week, however if you are going to go I would really recommend this hotel, it is only a two minute walk to the show ground. ",5,2016,07,26
213,Good business stay,Reception staff was very helpful and responsible. Rooms are clean. They have a great coffe machine with selection of several kinds of coffe. Brekfast is good as well as lunch wich was served at our meeting. Hotel Manager Egle is doing a great job.,5,2016,07,26
213,Great hotel,"Once again I stayed in the Herbert park hotel while visiting the RDS horse show and once again the hotel didn't disappoint - excellent services in beautiful surroundings with great staff,  maybe a little expensive for food and drink but for a short trip location justifies price - looking forward to next year",5,2016,07,25
213,Nice quality hotel,"The Herbert park is an above average hotel in upmarket area, clean spacious rooms with decent en-suite facilities, nice views in restaurant, quite a traditional French style menu, good bar and decent pint of Guinness. Bar was quite expensive. Nespresso machine in room was a nice touch.",4,2016,07,25
213,Exceeded expectations,"The Herbert Park is perfectly located in Ballsbridge, with easy access to the city centre and with a full range of local restaurants, cafes, pubs ,parks etc.
Hotel facilities and rooms were excellent, equipped with Nespresso, wi-fi and charging facility. Front of house staff could not have been more helpful.",5,2016,07,25
213,Efficient elegance in the heart of Dublin,"The ultimate test of any hotel is how it copes when every room is booked and its collateral facilities respond. By these yardsticks, the Herbert Park in Ballsbridge, Dublin deserves full marks. 

Last week my wife and I stayed for several days while the famous Dublin Horse Show was taking place across the road. The hotel was packed with competitors, exhibitors and spectators, many family groups among them. It is ideally located for the annual show (and indeed other events at the nearby Aviva Stadium) with the ease of secure parking not the least of its attractions. 

But despite the full house, the spotlessly clean and comfortable rooms were impeccably serviced every day. Each room now has a Nespresso machine and the updated air conditioning was very welcome as the city enjoyed a rare period of hot summer weather. 

Downstairs the lounge staff were totally attentive, whether efficiently dispensing rounds of drinks or serving food from a pretty diverse menu. (We didn't eat in the main restaurant this time.) 

Breakfast, despite the numbers, presented no problems. The staff quickly seated the guests and provided tea and coffee super-quickly. The cold buffet was of a high standard with a good selection of meats, cheese, freshly cut fruit, juice and bread. 

The hot buffet was equally attractive with kitchen staff constantly replenishing the choice of bacon, sausages, eggs   and puddings to ensure they were fresh and appealing. One criticism though: mushrooms heavily laced with garlic are not really part of the great Irish breakfast. 

The porters, too, were especially efficient, going out to greet guests as they parked and helping manhandle luggage into foyer. 

If you need a relaxing walk or a breath of fresh air, the adjoining Herbert Park has a web of footpaths meandering through trees and water features. And for those who want to eat and drink elsewhere, there are a number of great pubs and restaurants virtually on the hotel doorstep.",5,2016,07,25
213,Thoroughly enjoyable experience,"Return stay at this hotel for three nights (20-23 July) on business and leisure trip. The Herbert Park never disappoints. All the staff are welcoming,friendly and attentive,nothing is too much trouble for them. Room was spacious,well appointed and spotlessly clean. Good varied breakfast-I particularly enjoyed the made to order omelette. The lobby bar is a great place to have a drink and meet up with friends. Another thoroughly enjoyable experience. I highly recommend this hotel.",5,2016,07,24
213,Brilliant!,"Stayed for Dublin Horse Show, great location. Anton was fantastic to me and my friend assisting with car parking. Nazir in the bar was great, remembered my drinks for two day. Nothing was a problem for the staff. Food was fantastic. Definitely will be back.",5,2016,07,24
213,Okay for Business,"Location is nice enough backing on to Herbert Park, its close to the Aviva, some good restaurants and short drive to the main shopping area.  The rooms are good standard in size and state of repair. Breakfast is okay nothing special but good quality. Dinner not so great but plenty of good places within walking distance; id recommend Roly's.  Gym is pretty bad.  Very small and limited you can tell its there just to get the box ticked for an additional star.  Conference area is nice, light and very well maintained. ",4,2016,07,22
213,Two day stay in Dublin,"The Concierge ""Bernie"" was great he arranged for 13 of us to have dinner in a local restaurant, and also told us where we could get religious services on Sunday! Great job indeed! He also helped us in and out with our bags and repeatedly asked if we needed anything!",5,2016,07,20
213,Lovely and welcoming,"Really enjoyed our stay at the Herbert Park Hotel :-) the staff were all welcoming and always on hand if we needed anything. The night porters were brilliant and we felt they couldn't do enough for us.
The room was spotless and serviced each day. 
The hotel reception and bar was very comfy and pristine. It had a lovely luxurious feel and was brilliant value for money :-)",5,2016,07,20
213,"Hotel nice, but made me buy adaptor","The Herbert Park Hotel was nice. It was very clean and business-like. It is situated in the embassy area beside a park, which was lovely. However, every hotel I traveled to in Ireland was able to lend me an adaptor because mine stopped working after Donegal. The Herbert Park Hotel would only sell me an adaptor for my last 2 days in Ireland and for the price of 14 Euros. I later found the same basic adaptor in a shop in downtown Dublin for 6 Euros. For a hotel that appears to cater to business travelers, as well as any traveler, they should have adaptors available to borrow. They encouraged reviews on Trip Advisor and I offered to share this bit of information. Lovely hotel but not traveler-friendly.",3,2016,07,20
213,Wonderful stay,This hotel was lovely.room spacious and tasteful.polite staff.warm and welcoming.food was beautiful.we had room service and breakfast the following morning.chef cooked pancakes with soya milk for our son as he is dairy intolerant.all in all convenient and enjoyable ,5,2016,07,20
213,Loved it here,"Would instantly come back as it was a really fabulous  stay

Beautiful room.  Fabulous comfy bed , I slept so well! 

Breakfast was good too, lots of choice 

Definitely a repeat hotel ",5,2016,07,18
213,Wonderful Walking Neighborhood of Beautiful Old Estates out of Dublin,"Stayed here one night only prior to departure back home. Had to leave VERY early for airport. Hotel staff was aware and had delicious boxed breakfast prepared, which ate in lobby while waiting for transfer. Location of this modern hotel is in Ballsbridge, just SE of Dublin in a lovely treed, upscale residential neighborhood not far from the US Embassy.
Did not eat any other meals here. Understand that can walk into Dublin from here- about 20 min.",4,2016,07,18
213,Nice hotel - well located,"This is a sizeable and well maintained hotel approx 20 minutes walk from the main bar areas of Dublin.

The rooms are small but well kept and the facilities are good. Nice bar, restaurant and good service mean all in all a great place to stay.

Beds are comfortable and breakfast is very very good indeed.",5,2016,07,17
213,Fantastic Stay,We enjoyed our stay here.  We stayed for four nights and all questions and needs were met.  Highly recommend this hotel if you want to get away from the city center but still close enough to everything.  Very quiet was able to get a restful sleep.  The rooms were clean and towels and bedding soft.,5,2016,07,17
213,"Nice hotel, good location, friendly staff","The Herbert park hotel is a really nice hotel, with great rooms, and excellent service. We first got a room which smelled a bit of smoke and got to change rooms without any difficulty. Breakfast was excellent, and staff really friendly! The location is good, the Ballsbridge area is quite calm. Free wifi, good beds!",5,2016,07,13
213,Great stay for 2 nights,"We were in Dublin on a business trip and it was perfectly located for our needs. Stylish hotel and great rooms and amenities. 
Really nice bars and restaurants nearby so we ate out on both nights.  It a little way from the airport but ideal for us.",5,2016,07,13
213,Breakfast ,Just grabbed breakfast here following my hungry thousand yard March from Roly's - lovely surroundings attentive staff and a decent eggs florentine - too much hollandaise though for the one slice of toast (sliced pan) on which it was served. The eggs and ham were good. Needs to be served on something better than sliced own though - sourdough would be a better choice. Coffee was good though and came with a sinful little slice of tiffin,3,2016,07,13
213,Home away from home,"Ah the Herbert Park Hotel! Our home away from home! My wife and I stay here once a month and as soon as we leave we are looking forward to coming back. 
The Herbert Park is a gorgeous , modern, stylish hotel in the heart of beautiful, bustling Ballsbridge and overlooking the ever so relaxing Herbert Park and only minutes away from the centre of Dublin. 
They offer a wide range of value for money packages and the ""Overnight Indulgence"" is our favourite. It suits our needs perfectly with free car parking, breakfast to your room in the morning and late checkout, not to mention free Prosecco!
The food in the Herbert Park is fabulous and reasonably priced but what really makes the place special is the staff. From the moment you arrive to the moment you leave you are made to feel like a VIP. 
I couldn't recommend the Herbert Park highly enough. In fact I have, and anyone I have said it to was not disappointed! You won't be either!",5,2016,07,12
213,Nice hotel in good location ,"Stayed for a single night while attending a function in the city centre. Very good location and we had a very good stay. The staff were friendly, the room nicely furnished and the breakfast was superb.",4,2016,07,11
213,Excellent location . Facilities ok,"Stayed here for Rihanna concert a few weeks back. Very close to Aviva Stadium- within walking distance. Lovely area around Ballsbridge in general with plenty of restaurants and bars. 4-5 star location. I thought the facilities were average enough for a 4 star hotel. No swimming pool and gym was tiny and poorly equipped. The room was decent but again the only thing that I would suggest was of a 4 star quality was the provision of a Nespresso machine which was a nice touch. We ate in the bar and the food was decent but again, nothing spectacular.  
Overall, the location was fantastic but I have to say I was a little disappointed in the quality of the hotel's facilities for the price that we paid. I realise it's an expensive location but I would imagine there is better value to be had elsewhere in Ballsbridge.
Eoin.",3,2016,07,04
213,great location and service,Stayed here for one night only. Location is great as it is not far from the city centre and still in a nice quiet are. Great if you are attending one of the events in RDS. Room was very bright and spacious with big comfy bed. Nespresso coffee machine was a nice touch as I do like to have a good cup of coffee in the morning. Overall it was a very pleasant stay and I definitely would recommend this hotel.,4,2016,07,04
213,Great all round  hotel,"Stayed two nights in standard room july 2106, it may have been a standard room but was pleasantly surprised by the quality of the room, a good size and generous  sitting area with the bonus of a nespresso coffee machine. nice welcome on arrival, and hope to stay again soon!",5,2016,07,04
213,Conference stay at Herbert Park,"Our entire company team stayed at the Herbert Park during a conference where we were exhibiting at the nearby (walking distance) RDS

Well situated in the Ballsbridge area, we selected the Herbery Park as a better value option than the nearby Intercontinental which is fantastic but extremely expensive

The Herbert Park sets within a modern apartment residence, quiet, green, good staff, very nice breakfast, nice bar area

The price value matrix is tricky, Dublin seems very expensive and I say that living in London

But the Herbert Park served our team well, and the staff and facilities were more than adequate

This is a good place to stay in Dublin, particularly for the conference centre nearby

",4,2016,07,03
213,"Great combination of location, accommodations and service","If you are looking for a hotel that is close to, but not in the downtown the Herbert Park Hotel is a great combination. We stayed in 6 hotels during a tour of Ireland, and this was one of the top two.

What made our stay here so good:
- Service from the staff was consistently quite friendly and helpful.
- We had dinner early one evening in the lounge. The food was very tasty and service was excellent. More relaxed than a restaurant.
- The full breakfast buffet in the mornings offered a wide variety and was one of the best of the trip.
- There are several good restaurants within a short walk.
- The rooms were comfortable and well sized.
- All areas were very clean and tidy.
- The elevators require the room key to be used to get to the guest room floors, so that is added security.
- Security was not a concern, as the area is a nice section of the city, with nice residential neighborhoods and quiet streets.
- The hotel is directly adjacent to the eponymous Herbert Park.
- We took several walks through the neighborhoods, over to the grocery, through the park and even up into parts of the central city.

The hotel does not have the fancy exterior and extravagant furnishings shown in reviews of Dublin's 5 star hotels, but we really liked our stay here.",5,2016,06,30
213,Pleasant area,"If you're looking for a  stay in a quiet, leafy, pleasant  area of Dublin I'd recommend this hotel. Good choice of restaurants, pubs etc. nearby  in easy walking distance. Felt very safe. Room   was comfortable, food was good and staff very helpful. i would stay there gain.",4,2016,06,29
213,"Great coffee in the room, nice touch !",I travel to Dublin with business on a regular basis. My first choice of hotel is always the Herbert Park. You always receive a great welcome and all the staff go out of their way to ensure your stay is a pleasurable experience. Recently the hotel have placed coffee makers in the rooms and the coffee is great a really nice touch. Anyone thinking of staying over in Dublin particularly on business I strongly recommend this hotel.,5,2016,06,28
213,Absolutely wonderful experience ,"Amazing place to stay in Dublin.I had wonderful time during my stay . Atmosphere was great, food was delicious and staff very kind and helpful  Duty manager Egle and Adam were very good to us, even recognized with our Name. Which we felt was  very personal. Will go there again if we visit south dublin again. ",5,2016,06,27
213,Excellent service,Every aspect of the service staff have been special during our two day stay at the end of a ten day tour.  All are helpful and friendly.  Had a very good breakfast in the restaurant this morning and will be enjoying a continental breakfast before departing for the airport in the morning.  The front desk made the calls to arrange my taxi to the airport and have been helpful throughout. Elevator and floor security takes room key to access.,5,2016,06,27
213,"Neat, roomy and functional",Spacious rooms - try for a corner.  Wifi seemed more consistent this stay.  Add breakfast to your booking if you can - it is functional and convenient.  Desk staff very helpful. Gym area small with limited equipment so arrive early or find an alternative.  After a couple of stays this place is growing on me - the location works well in my case and the modern spacious rooms are a bright spot. ,3,2016,06,27
213,A quiet place to visit Dublin.,The hotel is new. The atmosphere is nice. Service in lobby and at the front desk are excellent. From the entrance of the hotel it's 50 meters to the beautiful park. A lot of birds and squirls. Near the hotel are some restaurants and pubs.,5,2016,06,26
213,Excellent stay,We stayed here for 1 night. We wanted somewherr close to the aviva stadium as we were going to a concert. Lovely hotel. Room was clean and spacious and bed very comfy. The coffee machine in the room was great. So handy to bars/food. And easy walking distance to the aviva. Lovely place. We will be back.,5,2016,06,22
213,Good rooms,"The staff at the hotel were all friendly and helpful. Reception is huge. The rooms were very good, spacious and in good condition.  Some of the best I have experienced in Dublin. They each have a nice coffee machine. 
The bar area is very comfortable and had a large to watch the football.  
There are some good pubs a cross the road but the city centre is a short taxi ride away. Has the advantage of bent quiet at night. ",4,2016,06,20
213,Very enjoyable as ever,"Stayed one night at the Herbert Park Hotel.   Have stayed here a few times and always find the service to be very good.   Its a good hotel - clean, nice size rooms and excellent staff.  Had bar food which was very good.   Its location is great - lots around the area and quick stroll to the city centre.  
Positives: Location, price, standard of hotel
Negatives: Parking extra cost (no option but to park in hotel), newspaper charged for but none of the Sunday supplements included.",5,2016,06,17
213,Bussiness trip,"Herbert Park Hotel is a very nice place to stay. Room itself perfectly suited with all the things one needs. The only really missing thing on the room was a chair for the table, since I work with a computer a lot.",5,2016,06,17
213,A top stay in Dublin,We recently returned to the Herbert Park Hotel to spend an excellent weekend  there. The check in staff were extremely helpful particularly Inona and we were given a top class room with a plaza view. Darragh in the bar deserves a special mention for his  service and we will return.,5,2016,06,16
213,Excellent Hotel especially for Business Travels,"Excellent service and a variety of superior rooms. Furthermore I can highly recommend the breakfast. Especially for business travellers a very good choice.
I highly enjoyed my stay at the hotel. Thank you all for making my stay perfect.",5,2016,06,13
213,"Good quality hotel, great customer service","Room was relatively large, modern and spotlessly clean. I understand that the hotel recently upgraded the a/c and introduced a nespresso machine - thumbs up on both counts. Breakfast was excellent, with lots of options.
My only criticism was in relation to the telephone line, which was not working and I understand that the hotel is trying to address this problem.
Front of the house staff very helpful and polite, especially Davide.",4,2016,06,12
213,Great Hotel,"We stayed at this hotel for a conference. It is in a perfect location just on the edge of Dublin and is next  to a lovely park.
The staff are very friendly and helpful 
It is within walking distance of the main shopping areas and you can also jump on a hop on hop off bus for sightseeing",5,2016,06,12
213,Organised a conference at hotel,"I organised a two day conference at the Hotel. Central Dublin was too expensive and the Herbert Park Hotel offered excellent value in a delightful area close to the centre of the city. Breakfast and lunch were excellent, conference facilities were all we needed, but the reciting staff were superb, solving the last minute problems like adapters and computer connectors instantly and adjusting coffee times and lunchtimes to suit the conference. The group of 65 were delighted with their stay in Dublin and I was impressed with the hotel, thank you especially to Ioana, Bernie, Angele, (duty manager) and Michael on Reception, good job!",5,2016,06,12
213,In-room Nespresso ,"I did not try the breakfast but the In-room Nespresso machine really did it for me. Perfect location next to convention Centre, friendly staff, quiet, easy access to park for a walk. It does come at a price though... ",5,2016,06,11

Thanks especially to David.",5,2016,06,10

213,Good hotel & great staff,"I was concerned about the location of this hotel -- in Ballsbridge, a bit on the outskirts of the city centre. But if you're OK with public transportation, the No. 4 or No. 7 bus stops a block or two from the hotel (next to the U.S. Embassy) and takes you directly to the city centre in less than 10 minutes. Once there, the city is pretty walkable. For late nights we took a taxi -- about 12-14 euros. The hotel is spotless & the air conditioning is among the best in Europe. The staff was extraordinarily helpful, polite and professional.",5,2016,06,01
213,good service,Very good service.  We arrived at 8 am they sent us to the complimentary breakfast and they were able to track us down and check us in within a half hour.  The service was excellent.  The location is very nice with a few pubs just across the street and a 15-20 minute walk to downtown Dublin.,5,2016,06,01
213,Visiting the Dublin Horse Show at the R.D.A.,"we stay at this hotel every year when we visit the Dublin Horse Show.  It is literally just across the road from the show - 2 minutes walk - which is great for us.  the hotel has always been clean and efficient with helpful staff on reception.  the breakfast is a good choice of hot Irish breakfast or lots of other choices for those preferring fruit, toast, yogurt etc.  would prefer a bit more variation on the evening dinner menu but still good enough for a 2/ 3 night stay.",4,2016,06,01
213,No complaints,I had a business meeting in the Terrace Lounge at this hotel. Nicely laid out and plenty of space between tables - ideal for a meeting. Coffees and speciality teas in the morning. Great service and exactly as ordered. Later had lunch and the chicken panini was the freshest and tastiest I've had in ages. Servers were professional and discrete. Presentation excellent. A mini banoffi with every cup! Delicious. A 4 star hotel with characteristics of a 5 star. ,5,2016,05,31
213,A nice place to stay outside of the fray,"This was a nice place to stay for one night.  The rooms are getting on the tired side and could use some refreshing, but the amenities were lovely.  The front desk staff was very helpful and professional!  A really nice location outside the city center and so the neighborhood is quiet and peaceful!",4,2016,05,31
213,Best nights sleep in days!,"Having to visit Dublin for work I was a little uncertain never having met the Irish in their home land. I should not have worried – I could not fault them!

It was a late booking as I my work had over run. Having worked in the Hotel trade in a previous life the Herbert Park was not known to me – I could not fault them either.

A late arrival – to say the least – and then the best nights sleep I had had for some time. A few quiries next morning arranging my flight and they were more than helpful.

Set in a pleasant location with a couple of “Irish Pubs” and a nice little Italian Restaurant over the road.

Overall a good hotel – my type of hotel!",5,2016,05,30
213,Herbert Park Hotel,"We stayed at the Herbert Park Hotel for 3 nights in May. The 20th thru the 23rd. It was a very pleasant experience. The rooms were lovely, clean and comfortable. The staff could not have been nicer.  Everyone went out of there way to make you welcome. I would definitely recommend this hotel.",5,2016,05,30
213,Nice decor,"The Herbert is a very nice and spotless hotel. I liked the decor and the excellent service. The room was very comfortable with cozy bedding and good climate control . 
Breakfast is full Irish and continental and the food was very good. 
The staff were friendly and helpful.",4,2016,05,29
213,Helpful staff,The staff was particularly friendly and helpful. They coached us on how to use their lobby computers and printer so we could print out our airplane boarding passes for the next day and they also arranged a taxi to the airport for us at a fixed price with the taxi company. Our room was comfortable with a desk and one easy chair. WiFi was good. Bath was small and the pillows were hard - as were all of the pillows during our 10 day trip through Ireland. We had to fetch our own ice by going to the bar in the lobby. Nice hotel. We would stay again.,5,2016,05,28
213,The best Mocha in town! ,Thank you to Dagmara for making two superb mochas for me at my meeting at the Herbert Park earlier this afternoon. And to Laura for a warm and friendly welcome. Check out their lobby coffee bar - it's a great place to meet people for business or pleasure and it beats many of the specialist coffee shops hands down. ,5,2016,05,27
213,A sea of tranquility in the city,"The Herbert Park Hotel was a great choice for accommodation in Dublin city. We were in the city for a family event and wanted somewhere convenient to the city but not chaotic. It is very well located in Ballsbridge, about 10-15 minutes in taxi from the City Centre. It is a beautiful 4 star hotel, with a large airy open foyer, with plenty of light streaming in. The receptionist was efficient and pleasant on arrival. Our room was very spacious with a view out over the Herbert Park, which felt like we were in a country estate and not in the City Centre. Or room had a very handy Nespresso Coffee machine, which was very convenient. The furnishings were modern and bright and cleanliness was perfect. Our room was quite, with no noise from outside corridor. Breakfast in the morning was a delicious event with a buffet on offer with all the usual fare including, fresh fruit, croissants and hot food. We lingered over breakfast as the dining room is beautifully located overlooking the park and even ordered a second pot of tea to enjoy the surroundings. The Herbert Park is a really great location with a very efficient but relaxed atmosphere. When we were leaving we noticed that there were a number of business people having meetings in the foyer lounge area, which seemed to be an established place for such events. In fact I will definitely keep it in mind next time I organise to have a face to face meeting in Dublin. Well worth a visit. Can't wait to go back.",5,2016,05,25
213,Family night away,"Very nice hotel, had a lot of trouble with key cards when operating the lift, then did not work on room door either. Room was very clean but had fans right outside window, very noisy. Breakfast was very disappointing.",3,2016,05,23
213,Service Excellence,"We visited the Hotel for a family get-together to celebrate an 80th Birthday.  Our group of 15 people were looked after wonderfully from start to finish, no request was too much trouble and everyone we dealt with was smiling, courteous and helpful.  Food was excellent, location is superb, they made the day very special.",5,2016,05,23
213,Great property,Breakfast overlooking Herbert Park for the perfect start and ideally located beside the RDS and close to Aviva stadium. Brilliant rooms and the wifi is great. A real quality feel about the place and very friendly staff. Loved the spacious lobby with extensive menu and best afternoon tea. Top marks. ,5,2016,05,22
213,"Fabulous package, fabulous hotel","Booked on a Friday for the following Saturday night to celebrate our wedding anniversary.
""FABULOUS PACKAGE"" included breakfast, parking and a chilled bottle of Prosecco waiting in the room. We ate dinner in the restaurant and the food was really good. Excellent quality and great presentation. The waiter was charming and attentive but not intrusive. The room was spacious and comfortable.",5,2016,05,22
213,Simply the best,"We have been staying at this hotel for many years on our occasional visits to Dublin, it is without doubt one of the most comfortable hotels in the most attractive part of the city, Ballsbridge, where you have the embassies, great restaurants, pubs and right beside the Royal Dublin Show grounds and the Aviva rugby stadium and only a short walk or taxi ride into the Grafton Street shopping area.
The hotel is linked through a Japanese gate to the beautiful tranquil Herbert Park, a haven of peace in the city, popular with walkers and joggers and the park view rooms in the hotel have a wonderful view into this lush parkland.
For us, one of the most attractive features of the hotel, apart from the friendly staff and their always welcoming front of house manager Egle, is the reception foyer area which extends almost the full length of the hotel and is a popular place to meet and to eat and drink, but because of the spacious layout design seems uncrowded and peaceful.
Breakfasts in the dining room overlooking the park are especially enjoyable, lots of room, comfortable, relaxing and great staff providing attention to detail with a wide choice of food. We cannot comment on the restaurant dinner menu since we normally eat out in one of the many good restaurants in the area or more often we choose the delicious foyer food.
Rooms are spacious, clean, with good quality furnishings and quiet, but as mentioned earlier, the park view rooms are particularly attractive.
When in Dublin we would not think of staying anywhere else.
One last comment, we always book directly on the hotel home website, that way we build up credits for upgrades.",5,2016,05,22
213,Great Relaxing Location,"Very nice rooms with very good beds. Excellent breakfast and service. Location was especially good since it was quiet but still close to the city center. Surrounding area had plenty of shops, restaurants and Pubs. Adjacent to very nice park",5,2016,05,19
213,Tea and coffee at last.,"We have stayed in this hotel many times because of its good location, comfortable and quiet rooms , friendly staff and easy parking . What a pleasant surprise we had on our recent visit to find a coffee machine in the room. This is a very welcome addition  and we are looking forward to a return visit but what about some complimentary biscuits too?",5,2016,05,18
213,Everything you want in a hotel,"Very nice hotel. Everything is top notch, rooms clean and well appointed, staff friendly and attentive, lobby bar excellent. Restaurant is very nice. 2 mile walk to downtown, taxis and busses easily accessible. A few Irish Pubs across the street.",5,2016,05,18
213,Excellent,"Excellent service, rooms and staff. Great location for our needs, definitely will be back.
I understand coffee machines have now been installed in every room which was probably the only negative point I could have made.",5,2016,05,17
213,Don't like the seats in the bar,"This is a very impressive hotel close to Ireland's International Rugby Stadium, the Aviva. It also has proximity to RDS

The lobby bar is a great environment but the chairs and seats are so uncomfortable

Wifi is good and there are some nice bars close by

",4,2016,05,15
213,More like a 5 stars hotel,"Have been in Herbert park hotel for around 15 times.
Great atmosphere and services. Elegant and spacious room design.
Delicious full irish breakfast buffet.
Espresso machines recently introduced in the guest rooms.",5,2016,05,13
213,Another gorgeous stay at the Herbert Park,"This is just a wonderful place to stay in Dublin, close enough to the city but far enough away to enjoy tranquility and lovely surroundings.  As always, check in was lovely and we got upgraded without asking - our room was stunning and looked out over the park.  Throughout our stay the staff were really lovely and couldn't do enough to make us feel welcome and looked after.  Breakfast was delicious, served in a lovely room overlooking the park, lots of choice and lovely serving staff.  You can park under the hotel which is rare in Dublin and although normally an additional cost, ours was included in the package we bought.  Overall, we loved it and can't wait to book again.",5,2016,05,12
213,Ok business hotel,"Hotel is clean, staff are friendly but the rooms are so very very hot! I did not sleep due to the heat and did not want to have the air con on all night, Please turn down the heat! Nice location beside the Park and good restaurants close by.",3,2016,05,11
213,Nice hotel in green area,"I've stayed several times in this hotel for business purposes and I have to say I like it a lot. Not far from Dublin center, in green area close to pitoresque park and great breakfast with view to the Herbert park. And also hotel staff is so nice. Perfect location for business conferences and personal stays.",5,2016,05,10
213,Just perfect !,Great location for us. I came from the airport and my friend was coming from Wexford so location was perfect.  Reasonably priced twin room. Only 20 mins walk to city centre. If thats not your intention there are amenities nearby also. Staff extremely friendly. Rooms/bathroom spotless..Will definitely stay here again. ,5,2016,05,08
213,Great staff!,"Herbert Park is fortunate to have a front desk man named Davide to assist guests, such as me!, with problems.  Very comforting to have such kind and willing assistance when visiting in a foreign country.",5,2016,05,08
213,Lovely Hotel in prime location,"The Herbert Hotel is a lovely Hotel. Rooms are nice, staff seemed friendly and the food was very good. The Hotels proximity to Bars and restaurants is appealing as is the proximity to The Aviva Stadium.. There is ample parking space and The Terrace Bar area has a really good atmosphere.. I would highly recommend this Hotel to both tourists and business persons..",4,2016,05,06
213,Nothing Special,"A moderate business hotel with average facilities. No entertainment on site and little to visit nearby. 

Surely business travel doesn't have to be this dull?

Some of the reception staff are pleasant but service was nothing special. My alarm call happened three times, the last in person whilst I was in m the shower. 

Will avoid when I next visit Dublin. ",3,2016,05,06
213,A very pleasant stay,"I have to say I was very impressed with The Herbert Park Hotel.  We had the pleasure of staying there last night and we will definitely be going back again.  From checkin to checkout the visit was seamless and the staff are very helpful and friendly. The room was very comfortable and spacious and we had a very pleasant view over Herbert Park. Breakfast in the room was varied, plentiful and perfectly timed. I would recommend this Hotel without hesitation. ",5,2016,05,01
213,Great Stay,"Had a wonderful stay here while on our 12 day tour of Ireland.  We arrived very early and the hotel staff had a room waiting on us, which was perfect after the long flight the night before.  The rooms are spacious and very comfortable.  The restaurant and bar staff were always quite helpful. We found some great choices for food right across the street from the hotel from fine dining to pub grub. Its about a 20 min walk to the center of Dublin but easy to catch a taxi.  Lastly, we needed extra towels and pillows and the staff immediately brought them to our room.  We couldn't have been happier starting our tour off at this property",5,2016,05,01
213,Good hotel in Dublin,"Good 4 star hotel in Dublin, located at Herbert Park, a nice park just outside the city centre. My room was quite big and clean, quiet, and the staff was friendly and helpful. Not easy to get a taxi quickly, so my suggestion is to book it in advance in case you need not too be late.",3,2016,04,28
213,Disappointing end to weekend break,"The hotel looks the part with nice surroundings, however the distance to Dublin city centre can be costly by taxi as it is a long way to walk.
The weekend turned sour when my daughter accidentally spilled a small cup of coffee onto the carpet. She tried to clean it up as best as she could but had no cleaning products. The hotel has complimentary coffee machines in each room and surely they should be insured for spillages, but apparently not. They took without any authorisation 150 euros from my daughters bank account to pay for the carpet to be cleaned which is extremely excessive. When the hotel were told that the spillage was accidental they showed no interest. 
They have treated my daughter poorly and unfairly which has left her distraught. I would advise people to be wary of this hotel and its attitude. We certainly will not return to this hotel in the future.",1,2016,04,26
213,Family friendly hotel,"We had four kids with us from 4-10 years of age. The staff were excellent from check in to check out. Very friendly and helpful. We ate dinner there one night and the menu was well received by the kids. The buffet breakfast was extremely family friendly (chocolate muffins!) and the service was outstanding. Very enjoyable visit. There was free wifi, good connection and we had several devices connected.",5,2016,04,26
213,Nice hotel,"Nice hotel although single room a bit small, food was great, service first class.
New nespresso machine didn't work and aircon a bit noisy. Hotel a fair walk from the centre of Dublin but on a dry day its pleasant. Nice surrounding - nice park for a walk or a run.",4,2016,04,25
213,"Beautiful setting, very comfortable hotel","We spent 3 nights here to join a tour. The hotel has great service, modern rooms, and a friendly staff. They have a restaurant on site serving 3 meals a day, plus cocktails. There are also srveral good pubs nearby if that is your thing. Cab service at the door, what more could you want.",5,2016,04,24
213,Lovely hotel great business trip,"Stayed here this weekend for a one night stay, with a work trip. Fantastic staff on reception greeted us so nicely on arrival and were helpful with all our questions. Rooms are stunning very comfy and spacious. Nice touch with the nespresso machine, and bottles of water.  Lovely area with lovely bars and restaurants. Hotel bar was lovely for a few relaxing drinks too again with the staff being extremely attentive. Would stay here again on a leisure trip.",5,2016,04,24
213,Average hotel but nice neighborhod,"We had an event at the Royal Dublin Society and booked Herbert Park Hotel.  The rooms are a bit worn, but it is located in a good neighborhood surrounded by restaurants and pubs. It has a 4 star rating but in my opinion was a bit pricey.  If you need to be by the stadium or Royal Dublin Society it is a good choice because both are at your doorstep.",3,2016,04,23
213,great meeting place,"We go there often for both coffee and lunch. Service is always, without exception, friendly and efficient. Menus are good, lots to choose from. Lovely ambiance - always a relaxed feel about the place. Dagmar and Anna on the lobby lounge floor really look after their customers well and with a smile. Happy to recommend without hesitation.",5,2016,04,20
213,Crap service by the Duty Manager at Breeakfast,"I am generally the one to look for positives in any place because the hospitality industry is very challenging and people generally work very hard as well.

But I was surprised on the treatment of was given by the Duty Manager at the breakfast arena. I was staying at the hotel for 2 nights only and it was my first time with them and in Dublin. As I entered the breakfast arena he asked for the room number and pretended not to understand me. Then he didn't even bother to show.me to a table and just moved on to something else. I would have understood if it was crazy busy except that it wasn't.  I had to wait for 20 mins for someone to serve coffee or tea at my table because generally the Duty Manager shows a guest to their table and checks what they want and gets the waiting staff to get it. I thought maybe it was a one off case, only to be proven wrong. Next day same thing repeated again, however this time I saw how he treated other guests. He was addressing them by their names, showing them to their table checking up on them from time to time. 

I feel that.just because I am a woman and non indigenous background I shouldn't be treated like that.

I will not be recommending this place to anyone.",1,2016,04,20
213,Pleasant stay in a beautiful hotel in a peaceful part of Dublin! Lovely park beside it to go for a walk or run in! ,I stayed here for one night I was upgraded to an executive suite for free it was a fabulous room! I had dinner in the A la carte restaurant and it was divine:) Breakfast next morning was also very nice!!! Beautiful park nearby to walk or run in or just people watch or like me watch nature! ,5,2016,04,19
213,Sterile and uninviting..,"Stayed here for a couple of nights recently - was not that impressed to be honest - it is an expensive hotel so I expected more - Reception staff were not particularly welcoming - the room, whilst being clean, was so noisy..a new air con system is in place apparently and the noise of it kept is awake - it sounded like the toilet was filling up constantly.  The view was of an office block across the courtyard - so you had to be pretty careful when dressing etc.  Charging for car parking is a bit mean - and they only give you 15 minutes from activating your card to leave the hotel and car park, so if you want to sort out your car before setting off you are on a timer!  I will not be returning - I felt ripped off for some reason..and breakfast at nearly €20 each really is a rip off.",3,2016,04,19
213,"Great hotel, lovely staff.","Fabulous hotel. The staff are so pleasant and accommodating. Hotel itself is lovely, nice rooms and the food is top class. Where else in Dublin can you eat your breakfast while watching the squirrels playing in the park. I would recommend the hotel to anyone. I will definitely be staying there again.",5,2016,04,15
213,Great business hotel,"Being a regular business visitor to Dublin must recommend Herbert Park. Location is convenient, rooms are spacious, service is kind and attentive, beds are good, and you can sleep with the windows open as the hotel is set off the main road and at the edge of the park. We have stayed at Dylan's, former Four Seasons (now Intercontinental, Marrion etc, but if you are for business in Dublin with no need to impress your business peers then Herbert Park is superb. Right next to Roly""s and Libster Pot restaurants, you will be spoiled with great food. ",5,2016,04,10
213,Holidays,A very nice Hotel. Staff very friendly and rooms very clean and comfortable a very nice park int He area for children and families. Quite close to city of Dublin public transport is a little distance away. But taxis are very prompt. Just be aware some charge more than others. Tourists are fair game,5,2016,04,06
213,Classic Style,"Nice hotel ,overpricing with some items but quality is very good, my boyfriend and i we stayed for 3 days , we made a lot of good friends , staff very attentive and friendly we wanted to thanks the night manager Jess for give us a good time during our stay,  (gone in the morning) also the house keepers who clean our room all days everything is amazing on this hotel highly recommended.",4,2016,04,02
213,Very nice,The hotel itself was lovely. Very clean and spacious. The staff were very helpful throughout and the rooms were perfect. The hotel is situated in quite a nice area of dublin- a little outside the city centre but not too far away. Couldn't ask for more.,5,2016,03,31
213,Restful oasis for the weary business traveller,"I've been staying in the Herbert Park regularly now for the past 3 years and I find the experience to be fantastic.  The Staff are attentive and make a big effort to look after my every need - right down to emptying the mini-bar of the the food items lest I am tempted.  I've found the food to be top class and as I use room service quite a bit, the food is always served piping hot by attentive Staff.

The Bar & Food service is equally good and the Staff always make an extra effort for regular visitors.  Location is good as it is in the heart of Ballsbridge and you can access the city easily.  It also has DIY parking which suits my particular needs.",5,2016,03,31
213,"One night city break, real treat.","I have stayed in the Hebert Park Hotel three times now, all for pleasure and on each occasion for one night. The best thing this hotel has is the staff which is by far the most important factor for any hotel. Second to this is the location in Ballsbridge which is just outside the central business district but close enough to walk home from the city centre. Just outside the hotel are 20+ pubs and restaurants all within 2 mins walk. The hotel is a boutique hotel and not part of a chain which is really nice. The whole feeling of the place is 'understated' and relaxed. They even put me into the same room (409) that I stayed in last time which was a lovely touch. One downside is no swimming pool, real shame. Cost wise it is average. Dublin has got quite expense for hotels, again! There are cheaper hotels nearby but regards quality, the Herbert Park Hotel is great value for what you get. It is now my favourite Dublin hotel.",5,2016,03,28
213,Expensive and poor,We stayed at the hotel over easter and it was poor. We were made to buy a meal on good Friday in order to have a drink nd it was 11 euro for a panini. The food was luke warm and unappealing.  Every other hotel was allowing residents to drink without food. Just a money making exercise. No tea and coffee making facilities in the room just an overpriced mini bar and room service at 4 euro a coffee. Shower was poor and to get in at night you have to prove who you are to a very aggressive security guard - miles out of time. Avoid it like the plague!!!!,1,2016,03,28
213,"Very nice hotel, good location to the sites of Dublin","My Daughter and I spent the night at the Herbert Park hotel while site seeing in Dublin. The hotel staff were nice to talk with but wanted to direct us to the hotel restaurant and not any of the other local establishments, had to ask a few times before the offered any other places.

The hotel is very up to date, clean and fairly easy to get to from the airport. You could walk from the hotel to the core downtown but it would be about 15 minutes. We hopped on a Uber/Taxi and it was about 7 Euros. From the airport taking the Uber/Taxi it was 28.50 euros so about $32 going by today's exchange rates.

All in all very nice hotel with good staff, some nice dining nearby and close enough to all the sites.

Highly recommend. ",4,2016,03,27
213,Comfy stay in Dublin,"A Very nice hotel and nice room we had ..

Had a minor blip that hotel generously covered for us. Nicely located next to the park and nice pubs and cafes and city center not too far away (approx 20-25 min walk). The staff were Very nice and polite staff also. Probably more of a business hotel. Wifi service could be improved though - had to log in each time leaving and coming back to hotel. Minor issue but 2016 you'd expect automatic connection.

All in all though not a lot to fault and a pleasant stay.",4,2016,03,25
213,Uncomfortable ,"Hotel is convenient and ideal location for my business trip. Main problem with the hotel is the extremely uncomfortable bed, pillows and duvets. The bed linen is also a bit dated and hard. 
As a business traveler having a good rest was really the utmost priority.
I am not sure management offers any options for mattresses and bed linen",2,2016,03,25
213,Great place to relax and unwind,Was impressed with the greeting we received where we were welcomed back (not having been there since 2011).  The room was very comfortable however I was disappointed that there was no tea or coffee making facilities which I feel should be basic addition to any room.   Had a drink in the bar and while it was a bit pricey it provides a nice relaxing atmosphere.,4,2016,03,25
213,A relaxing haven,"We stayed in The Herbert Park Hotel for one night and will definitely stay there again on our return to Dublin. 
It Is conveniently situated in Ballsbridge.
It offers comfort, style, friendly staff, well equipped bedrooms, and above all friendly and efficient staff. 
We eat in the dining room for our evening meal and thoroughly enjoyed the relaxing atmosphere there.
Our waiter was very polite,friendly and very efficient and catered for all our needs and requests. We did not get his name but he told us he was from Romania and what a lovely person.
Looking forward to our return",5,2016,03,23
213,Ideal Location for Aviva stadium,"The location for the Aviva was fantastic, and the first time we have stayed at Balls Bridge for a six nations weekend.  The room was clean and spacious.  No tea and coffee facilities was an issue. Good to see cultural diverse Staff who were courteous and helpful.
The increase in price without breakfast was not good value for money, particularly as we thought be had booked bed and breakfast.  Thus we were not inclined to use the bar, or restaurant.  Alternatively we enjoyed Roleys for breakfast and dinner, which was excellent standard.",4,2016,03,21
213,Unreasonable price mark up,"We have stayed at the hotel on several occasions in the past for six nations matches because of its proximity to the Aviva stadium and indeed the ease of getting to the city centre. We were disappointed to note that the cost per room over the rugby weekend was more than double the usual rate and did not include breakfast which was charged as an extra. Indeed if I booked the same room this week I could get DB&B for less than the rate we were charged. The room was comfortable but despite the mark up there are no in-room tea/coffee making facilities. Whilst I accept that some rise in the cost of the room may be justified, the excessive increase I believe is beyond reasonable.
A positive note is that the staff were all friendly and helpful which was some consolation.",3,2016,03,21
213,Rugby Weekend,"Perfectly located a short walk from the Aviva Stadium, this is a modern fairly stylish hotel in the upmarket Ballsbridge area of Dublin.  The hotel was very busy but nevertheless  there was a warm welcome at reception, the check in was prompt and efficient and I was able to park virtually at the front door.  The room was spacious and comfortable with a well equipped bathroom. The main reception/bar area had a burger counter beside large screen TVs and a small bar provided liquid refreshment, adding to a relaxed and comfortable build up to the game as opposed to the scrum in the local bars. In the morning we went for a stroll in Herbet Park which is right on the hotel doorstep and we had an excellent breakfast nearby.  In summary I would use the hotel for events in The Aviva or RDS again without hesitation.  The staff at reception, the bar and generally were particularly impressive stepping up to the plate on what was probably quite a frantic day.  I expected to pay over the standard rate for a 'game day' as I'd left it a bit late, such are the rules of supply and demand and I did so but not in my view excessively.  However prices increased significantly closer to the event date.",4,2016,03,21
213,Poor value for money,"We have stayed in this Hotel on a number of occasions over quite a few years. The location is excellent for the Aviva stadium and the 6 Nations rugby matches. We went last weekend for Ireland v Scotland and were appalled to find that the price per room was virtually double the usual rate at nearly 300 Euro per room per night, with no breakfast. The total bill left us feeling vastly overcharged for what we got. The breakfast we had to pay separately for was excellent in fairness. The room was standard but comfortable, although with a small and somewhat dated bathroom. There are no in room tea/coffee making facilities. Lying in bed we could virtually hear a telephone conversation in the next door room. Downstairs we were disappointed by the disappearance of the rather quirky separate bar of previous years, replaced by a nondescript counter at one end of a long open plan area - not very homely at all. The impression we had is that the hotel is in need of a revamp.  On a more positive note we found the staff friendly and efficient",3,2016,03,20
213,Consistently great service,"We use Herbert Park regularly for work it's one of the few ""work"" venues that is equally comfortable for personal trip. 
Great location and the staff are just super! 
Recommend for both business and pleasure and the park on the doorstep is a great added bonus for such a central venue 
",5,2016,03,16
213,Helpful & Friendly Staff,"The hotel staff team is very international bringing the best of the diverse cultures. The team works really hard to satisfy customers, as was the case with me. The team went above & beyond. Its those little things that count and make it a pleasure to return",4,2016,03,15
213,Rugby stay,Very warm welcome from front of house upon arrival despite large numbers present pre-rugby. Reception managed to secure our (5) rooms promptly despite our early arrival which was greatly appreciated. Parking a bit of a challenge so do get there early to claim an underground spot (tight) or street level. Room as always comfortable with bottled water supplied. Informed at breakfast following morning that it was not included in the original package which was a surprise. Staff proceeded to print out breakfast bills for each room and landed them at our table even before we were finished (depsite my early assurance that this would be taken care of upon check-out). This was most unexpected and did tarnish what was otherwise an enjoyable stay at a superbly located hotel. Check-out went smooth and the staff there could not have been more helpful. I'll keep the rating to 'very good' for now..,4,2016,03,15
213,Comfortable Business Hotel,"Excellent business hotel, centrally located. The rooms are nicely appointed with comfortable beds. The service, including the front desk, room service and restaurant staff is very good - they are friendly, welcoming and helpful. The food is very good - I had a package with breakfast included and the variety and quality of the buffet is very high (there is also a menu to order from). All in all this is my preferred hotel in Dublin especially on a business trip.",5,2016,03,12
213,Excellent choice,We stayed at the Herbert Park Hotel for two nights and found it to be an excellent place to stay. The staff were really helpful and the rooms were modern and spacious. The hotel is in an excellent location for exploring the city.,5,2016,03,11
213,Very Nice Hotel and Location ...,My wife and son stayed two nights. No complaints at all. Lovely hotel and fantastic location. I did read some of the negative reviews and it seems those guests had peculiar issues to themselves. Will be going back for sure.,5,2016,03,08
213,Lovely hotel with very high standards of cleanliness.,"Stayed here for 3 nights recently to visit the Axa Classic Car Show.  The hotel was clean, comfortable and staff very friendly and helpful.   It was the standard of cleanliness that stood out for us, especially the housekeeper that cleaned Room 423, the standards were exceptional and her little touches made all the difference. We got a good price to stay here for the 3 nights but unfortunately rates vary depending on the time of year.  We stayed room only so cannot comment on the breakfast, but our friends have stayed before and highly recommend the breakfast.",5,2016,03,08
213,Great Service - enjoyable short stay,We only stayed for one night as attending an exhibition close by. Rooms we're well appointed and average in size for the price range. Service was very good from some very pleasant staff. Breakfast was very good - again cannot complain -- will stay again.,4,2016,03,07
213,Beware the parking charges!!Sunday free on street parking,"last Sunday I was invited for a family lunch celebration to this hotel.There were 16 adults in the party, of whom there were 5 drivers.On average we enjoyed our lunch over a 3-5 hour period.As I was returning home to Wicklow I left after 3.49 hours.My car-park fee was 14.20€!!!Although I appreciate that premises in a location such as this would charge for parking it is the norm if you are a patron parking isnot charged.I complained to the duty manager who refered me to the general manager and his e-mail address.
I have now taken the opportunity to read reviews of guests who stayed at the hotel.The parking charges came up time and again over the last 12 months.Nothing has changed so contacting the general manager is a waste of my time.For those you patronise this hotel for lunch/dinner etc please park on the street which pay & display",2,2016,03,04
213,Fantastic location/ front of house staff ,From the moment you enter this hotels lobby one feels special. It is full of natural light and feels open and airy. Everyone we spoke to at the desk was fantastic. Great ambassadors for the hotel. Friendly and at the same time knowledgeable. The rooms are lovely. Highly recommended   ,5,2016,02,29
213,The Herbert park hotel. ,"I have stayed at the Herbert park hotel for one month. I have found that everything about this hotel to be above standard. The food, the rooms, the service everything has been first class. The location is also superb with some great restaurants and fantastic pubs within walking distance. It's ideal for the rugby as well!!!! 
Top class top marks to all the staff in the hotel. Well done. If only al hotels were like this!

213,Excellent Hotel with superior service and great food,I can highly recommend this Hotel in Dublin. The rooms are excellent and the service is always perfect. I stayed at several hotels in Dublin but this one is definitely the best. The park and area is also very beautiful. I can also highly recommend the food in the hotel. Thanks Davide and the Team for all your great service.,5,2016,02,25
213,Business and Pleasure while in Dublin,I have been staying in the Herbert Park for many years and never had a problem. The standard has always been very high the food has been excellent rooms very clean and the beds comfortable. The staff have always been very friendly so all I can say is stay at this Hotel and you won't regret it.,5,2016,02,24
213,Wonderful stay,"Just spent the weekend at the Herbert park hotel ballsbridge , had a great stay ,room was lovely only down side was no tea or coffee facilities ,although I have been told they are putting them in , hotel staff were very pleasant espically Michael on the front desk . Meals were lovely and A big thank-you to Paula and Savio who looked after myself and my husband at dining both nights . I would love to go again ,hopefully be back next year .",4,2016,02,22
213,Superb food!,"Visited Herbert Park Hotel for business - a dinner, lecture series and meeting. Genuinely impressed from start to finish; safe and accessible car parking - in the heart of Ballsbridge, a warm welcome and the food was simply sublime. 
A real treasure, will be back to stay!",5,2016,02,21
213,Visit to RTE Ray Darcy show,"We found this a great hotel location excellent parking no problem 
We found this hotel clean friendly and a quiet place to stay. It is always tricky to drive into Dublin from our part of the world and we have a fear of getting lost in the hectic city trafic, but I must say from the Red Cow to Balsbridge no problem, once you follow the canal you are there, that makes the location of the Herbert park hotel ideal for us. The staff are very friendly and helpful . Will definitely  stay there again.",4,2016,02,21
213,Modern Dublin Hotel,"Very clean and comfortable hotel.  Staff were ALL very competent and friendly. It was also nice to be served mostly by Irish staff.  Garage parking was possible.
One could walk into the City but it helps to be fit!!",4,2016,02,21
213,Rugby weekend made special👏,"My sister and I so enjoyed our stay when we attended the recent rugby international..
Our twin room had a park view and being on the end of corridor delightfully quiet .
On our arriival we were warmly greeted and surprised to discover our room was ready even though it was not long past noon ! During our stay we were impressed by the standard of service .. food quality was excellent .  We look forward to returning . 
A great hotel in lovely location. 
Only one facility lacking ...in room kettle ...",5,2016,02,20
213,Nice,Stayed here in November for two nights.lovely room.breakfast very disappointing not that warm and poor quality the following morning we went to a coffee shop next door and it was much better for half the price!! Location top class staff very pleasant.,4,2016,02,20
213,A room with a view,"This hotel is located in Ballsbridge - which is only 20-30 minutes walking distance to Grafton Street and Phoenix Park.
Directly across from US Embassy and close enough to Aviva Stadium.
Nice man in reception - Davide -offered us an upgrade and we landed on the 4th floor with a stunning park view and Wicklow Mountains.
Davide also surprised us with late checkout news - we had time until 2 pm next day!
Our room was spacious enough with king bed and 30"" Samsung TV. Clean bathroom with good water pressure shower !
After good, hot shower we decided to visit THE BAR for a complimentary Prosecco and absolutely amazing plate of mini sandwiches - highly recommended to everyone !
Next morning we had superior quality breakfast in the Pavilion Restaurant offering excellent choice of pastries, juices, cereals, yogurts, fresh fruit, cheeses, cold meats and much more.

Overall excellent - although for 200 euro a night I would expect a little bit more...
Perhaps an iron in the room also a kettle with tea and coffee, shower gel and I think one little soap is not enough for 2 in the room.",4,2016,02,15
213,Good business hotel,"I just stayed at the Herbert Park Hotel again for a business trip. It's a friendly, no-fuss, clean, well organized place - has everything you need and want for a business trip. In my opinion, the hotel is missing a bit of character, style and charme, but not in a very negative way - seems like it's intended to be that way. Service is friendly, prompt, and quick. The room service was quick and food was good, breakfast is standard, nothing extraordinary, but nothing to complain about either.
Don't look for fancy extras, but if you expect the above, this is what you get. Would stay there again for it's convenient location and good value for money!",4,2016,02,11
213,Customer service  ,"My partner & I recently stayed at your hotel & were very happy & impressed by the levels of customer service & efforts made to meet our needs. 
We arrived on a Sunday morning early, having got a transatlantic flight. I predicted we would be tired & did mention we would arrive early on the special comments box. I understand hotels can't always meet these needs due to general check out time being 12 noon. As I thought we were exhausted & so grateful to see our room was ready for our arrival, so we could get straight to bed. 
We spent 2 nights in total, the rooms are a little dated but what matters to us most is cleanliness & they are always cleaned to a very high standard. 
We checked out at 5am on a Tuesday morning to catch a flight, feeling jet lagged & probably not fully awake, we left some very expensive items in our hotel room. It took a few days once home before I realised this. I immediately called the hotel & a very courteous gentleman named Davide assisted me. He located the items & talked me through the steps of returning the items. He kept in touch via email & seemed genuinely caring & happy to help me. I really appreciated all his help & high levels of customer service.
I would like to take this opportunity again to thank Davide & compliment his work ethic. ",4,2016,02,09
213,Lovely hotel but lack the little touches ,"Stayed with daughter in this hotel. 
First impressions fabulous lovely enterence friendly staff.
Hotel was buzzy as there was a ruby match on.
We were given our room which was on the first floor over looking the car park . Was told was a lovely room by Michael we got into the lift. . Presses buttons to the first floor and the lift did not  move. ..We were not told to enter the card to make the lift go up .. A simple thing .
We arrived in the  room and after a long journey all we wanted was a cup  of tea ..
No tea making  facilities in the room.
We unpacked.  Usually in a hotel there are extra  pillows and blankets in the wardrobe. .. again  no extra  pillows ..but the room was lovely and cosy. 

We went to reception to ask 
about tea making facilities in our room. 
Was told a lot of complaints about tea and coffee facilties and this was going to be looked into in the next week .
 Eating at the hotel is very expensive well overpriced.  
Coffee is 4 euro  and you  can walk  across  the road and get a coffee for 2 euro. 
 Breakfast  continental is 15 euro and full irish 20 euro  per person .
 Again lovely hotel comfortable but well overpriced. 
It missed the little  touches like tea and coffee facilties. . 
It's an expensive hotel to stay and would expect the best .
When leaving the hotel we were asked was everything ok .
I mentioned about tea and coffee  facilties I was told it would be sorted within the next week with a vending machine. 
Lovely hotel comfortable, lack the little touches.,very much overpriced. ",3,2016,02,09
213,Will be back,"Love this hotel each time we stay. Staff are great. Good clean rooms. Lovely restaurant menu and great selection for breakfast. Love the location, just a little bit outside the city; yet a short taxi drive in",5,2016,02,07
213,A sunny hotel with a smile to match,"Excellent service   Wonderful breakfast and If you are having a meeting or conference here make sure Adam is on the team! He is OC events and ensure that everything is taken care of including when you phone does not charge 
Room service House keeping Front desk  Bar and Breakfast all good and all served up with a smile    Dublin at its best !",5,2016,02,04
213,Very Disappointing value for Christmas Day Dinner,"Decided to go hear for Christmas day dinner as had been before for Easter, special occasions etc where there has always been a buffet and the food and choice excellent.  However for Christmas day dinner, there was no buffet, just a very small, mean menu.  Our main course of turkey and ham was a not very filled plate with very little veg and NO ROAST POTATOES!!!  Only mashed!  No extra veg was offered.   For the money, which to be fair on Christmas day you expect to pay, you expect plenty of food and choice, good service and a good atmosphere.  There was none of that.  Also, one of party forgot to cancel out two members of the party so we were CHARGED FOR THEM although it didn't make a difference to the seating arrangements.  Not exactly in the Christmas spirit as they were making enough money from the skimpy meal served.  Heard the Glenview Hotel was excellent for Christmas Day - put on a real Christmas wonderland experience for €20 a head less!  Guess where we're going this Christmas!",1,2016,01,25
213,Afternoon tea. ,"Just had a lovely afternoon tea here, until the bill came, charged €4.25 each for a cup of coffee on top of the cost of the afternoon tea, this is not clear on the menu or by the waitress. Then to top that had to pay for parking as afternoon tea doesn't cover the car park. Definitely heading to the shelbourne next time",1,2016,01,23
213,Colm E,"fantastic business hotel , excellent friendly service from great staff , great location in the heart of Dublin adjacent to a wonderful , safe , public space , value for money with great range of eat out options within 1 mile radius . Centre city within 30mins walk and good range of public transport options.",5,2016,01,20
213,Expensive for what we received,"Family gathering though we were split over two tables by the hotel which seemed strange as it could easily have been accommodated at just one table.  Staff were friendly and the food was well presented. Set 3 course lunch was 34 Euros. There was just one other family gathering and our family dining that day and we were seated at long tables to the side of the bar. Round tables, as available in their restaurant, would have made for a much more enjoyable dining experience.",3,2016,01,18
213,Great stay,"This is a very clean and nice hotel. The staff is very helpful and polite and the rooms are nice for the price you pay for. The hotel is just 10 min walk from the Lansdowne Road train station where you can buy a ticket to the city center for 2,20€, this hotel is a little far from the city center but you can still get there fast.",4,2016,01,16
213,Excellent Friendly Service,"Kelly and the rest of the team looked after us superbly. Very friendly, excellent level of service, food was great. Our children reacted very well to being so well looked after - made them behave better than usual!",5,2016,01,14
213,Dinner at the Herbert Park,Had dinner in the Herbert Park this January. Food was very tasty and well presented. The price was a little more than you would expect but it was a very nice meal and location. All the staff i encountered were very pleasant and helpful. The hotel was lovely and it was really nice to have a stroll in the park located beside the hotel. All in all a really nice experience,4,2016,01,13
213,Lovely Place,"I spent 3 nights at the Herbert park hotel , my stay was really enjoyable great food , really nice environment fun work from all the stuff also i liked how fast they can answer your requests , i always woke up early before breakfast but the breakfast and coffee was not out at the time but Jesse from the night shift always was looking after me with a couple of coffee and bagels really nice gentle prices are really affordable and convenient to go anywhere in Dublin",5,2016,01,12
213,This hotel was lovely. The staff was very friendly and helpful. The breakfast buffet was fantastic.,"The hotel was really nice. Central location. We were able to walk to stores and pubs right across the street. The hotel had a great restaurant and bar. Very calm, quiet and relaxing. The lobby was decorated for Christmas. Very enjoyable",5,2016,01,08
213,Excellent Service and prefect stopover fduring bsuiness trips,I normally stay in Herbert Park during my business trips. The benefit is that it is close to office and is surrounded by many local pubs and joints. Each morning the breakfast is amazing and it has never disappointed me (other than getting charged for coffees as black coffee is normally served),5,2016,01,06
213,Excellent Hotel for business trips,"Am a very regular guest at this excellent hotel. The park that is attached to the hotel is stunning for a morning or evening walk. A very good start and end of a busy office day. The hotel facilities are great. Higher end Business traveler style....clean, spacious, well maintained, efficient.

The staff are excellent : very personal and warm welcome at all times and very helpful / friendly.

213,Great Hotel but breakfast expensive ,Stayed here for New Years Eve with cousins. When we arrived got food in the bar was lovely. Got a twin room and they put a fold up bed into it as there was three  of us. Was very comfortable. Room was lovely and big and not too warm like other hotels was just nice. Quiet at night too no noise. Would of been nice if room had tea/coffee facilities it was offered but for an extra charge bit disappointing. Got taxi from the hotel to 3 Arena which was very handy. When we got back after standing for an hour waiting on taxi the bar was still open and very friendly staff who made us hot chocolate. Weren't booked in for breakfast but paid for it. Breakfast was of good quantity but very expensive. Cousins got full continental breakfast at 19euro and something. I got 1 pancake and tea 15 euro something was lovely but mad prices for breakfast. ,5,2016,01,01
213,First impressions are good,"Bedroom exactly as expected, clean, large bed, comfortable and quiet. On;y disappointment was the timing of the restaurants which closed at 9.30 and staff thought that eating in the lobby was as good as eating in the restaurant.
If staying here, beware of limited parking under the hotel and also additional charge of 12 euros.",4,2016,01,01
213,overnight,We are regulars to the herbert park but not anymore.we stayed in room 425 on 28 December and the noise from the ventilation system from the adjacent office block kept us awake all night. This was annoying but the attitude of the reception staff was in deferent to say the least .dissatisfied as we cannot find any other fault.,2,2015,12,30
213,Far from the city center,"This is a nice hotel. The room I stayed was very good, a good size and comfortable. Breakfast is good and staff very helpful. The city center is away and if you need a taxi in rush hours you will have to wait a little bit. If you want to stay in Ballsbridge, the location is good with excellent restaurants near by.",3,2015,12,26
213,Two years experience at Herbert Park Hotel,"I have spent the last two year at Herbert Park Hotel, actually living half of my time here. The time i had was uncomparable in all aspects. The staff very friendly, very good food, great location, big and clean rooms. I certainly recommend to all they wish some relaxing and qualitative time",5,2015,12,16
213,Wow wow wow,"My husband and I stayed here as usual for our Christmas shopping trip  to Dublin as  but have never enjoyed it quite so much! We were treated to a wonderful upgrade, best room we have ever stayed in by far!!  (In any hotel). The reception staff  (Egle and her colleagues) were most helpful and pleasant. Breakfast was excellent and its always lovely to see Siva, an exemplary employee!! Can't wait to return. Thank you so much guys!!",5,2015,12,15
213,"Nice hotel, good matter-of-fact service, small rooms",Hotel premises are nice with a comfort lobby. Service was friendly and practical. Good breakfast. The only grievance concerns the size of my 1 person room. There was no writing desk or chair in the room so only place to do some work in my room was to sit in the bed. Size of the wardrobe was too small as well: I couldn't find place for all of my clothes even I was staying there only for two nights.,3,2015,12,15
213,Ask for a corner room; make sure breakfast included,I was very happy with my room in this hotel - it was a corner room and largish with lots of light and a modern fitout.  The hotel itself was in a convenient spot for my meetings.  On the average side were some patchy wi fi and some less than responsive staff at the breakfast desk when asked about the options available.  Probably a good choice if you have business in the area - and the front desk staff were on the ball - but perhaps best to either make sure breakfast is included or be prepared to pursue external options. The gym is minimalistic but functional if no crowd.,3,2015,12,13
213,"Very nice, but ...","The first thing I have to say is that this is a very nice hotel.  Staff at check in/out and in the bar area are very pleasant and professional.  The rooms are of a good size and comfortable.  The location is excellent - in the heart of Ballsbridge and an easy bus journey or walk into the centre.
My only issue, and it's something I hate, is that there are no tea or coffee making facilities in the room - you have to order via room service.  This is one of the very few hotels that do this - all the others in the area supply tea and coffee making facilities.  
If paying €3-4 to have tea or coffee delivered to your room does not bother you, then stay here. However, it bothers me and as such I will not be staying here again.",3,2015,12,10
213,Great location,"Lovely room, very comfortable beds. Very helpful reception staff, on check in and when we were looking for a taxi on a very busy night.
No proper bar food except soup, salads or sandwiches until 6 pm, very expensive glass of wine, even for a hotel.",4,2015,12,07
213,Excellent Service and Professional hotel,"I stayed for 2 night for a xmas party had a good time.with the managment and restaurant service all them.were really professional specially Lukas & Jesse that help me at night really polite guys and friendly having all my request done with professionalism , insuring  security all the time sharing cultural jokes from texas everything was really effective and professional i will be back next time thanks for all guys ",5,2015,12,06
213,Very good place to stay,"One night business trip, smart model hotel, guest room was large and well appointed. Good location with traditional bars over the road. I'd recommend and will return. Location may not suit everyone as not very central.",4,2015,11,30
213,Overnight for U2,Stayed here overnight when attending the U2 concert at the Point. The hotel location is fantastic and parking is easily accessed and affordable. Check in was fast & friendly. I returned late and had some food in the bar which was excellent. My room was in great condition and spotless with high quality amenities.,5,2015,11,30
213,herbert park hotel,"This hotel is ideally situated near the park. It is very comfortable. Staff are very helpful and friendly. Breakfast is high quality with great variety. Egle on front desk is especially helpful and efficient.

213,Great hotel in Dublin,"Having just returned from a recent stay in this hotel, I can highly recommend it to people that wish to have a break in Dublin in a good quality hotel. The hotel is located close to the city centre but not to close for the hussle and buslle of the town. It is about a 15-20 minute walk or a taxi for four persons about €15 each way. On arrival the hotel staff made our checkin very efficient and allocated us two rooms on the first floor of the hotel. The rooms are a,good size and decorated to a high standard and good quality beds. The down point of the room was that they do not provide tea or coffee facilities in the room but will provide fresh tea/coffee and biscuits to the room for a cost of €3.95, which is reasonable for the service. We did eat in the hotel terrace bar and found the food and drink to be good and at a good price. Breakfast in the morning is a self service Buffett with lots of choice of hot and cold food. The hotel has a underground car park that guests can use for €12 a day which is added bonus in this city. At the evening, we found a bistro called Rolys almost next door which we would recommend as the food was great and service good.

All in all this is a great hotel even being a distance from the city centre and has bars and restaurants close by.",5,2015,11,29
213,Super stay,"Three girlfriends & I had a great stay at the Herbert Park Hotel. We booked the Fabulous package so enjoyed free bubbly in our rooms, which were gorgeous. We had beautiful views of the park, an excellent breakfast & a €10 taxi to city centre so very close by. Really enjoyed it, I'd definitely recommend it",5,2015,11,25
213,Nice hotel...service could be a bit better,"We stayed at the hotel when visiting the RDS for the rugby (which is perfectly located for).  It was a two night stay...the rooms were nice and the beds were really comfortable.  The breakfast was nice but staff were slow to refill and were few and far between on the restaurant floor, I went to the bar in the evening and had two members of staff walk away while I was waiting to be served.  I'd stay again for comfort and convenience.",4,2015,11,23
213,"Overall, very good","Beautiful, luxurious room, very convenient parking, free wifi, lovely food, generally very helpful staff.

The restaurant is particularly nice with floor-to-ceiling glass giving lovely views of the park.

The only real inconvenience I experienced was with the heating - I arrived in the hotel at 8.30 on a very cold night to find that the room was cold. I couldn't figure out the heating controls, contacted reception who first tried to explain it over the phone and said, rather brusquely 'you have to wait for it to heat up'. I waited 20 minutes and rang again, someone came up and changed the setting (incorrectly as it turned out) again telling me to wait and give it time to heat up. Eventually someone from reception came up and, after some confusion and checking the online manual, fixed it. This member of staff was very obliging in the end but I didn't have heat in the room until after 10 and received no apology. Perhaps, as others have suggested, you get better service in the Herbert Park hotel if you appear to be very wealthy....

Overall, this is a really good hotel in an extremely good location. Beware the hidden extras though - no kettle in the room and €5 charge for tea or coffee, extra charge for poached eggs at breakfast or cappuccino, €12 overnight charge for parking.",4,2015,11,22
213,Mixed experiences,"I regularly stay here when in Dublin. It is generally very good, decent rooms, food and service. But my latest visit has been more fraught. When I arrived I was put in a prison like cell which was going to cost euros180 per night. This is because of the Internet booking app. Anyway I complained to the receptionist who was a real jobs worth who wasn't prepared to help and effectively said that all rooms were booked so tough luck! I insisted on talking to a Manager who came to see me within 15 mins. He was great, found a better room and everything was fine.

Tonight I've been playing the eye contact game with lounge service staff for a drink and meal. In the end I had to go to them. 

All in all this is not the service I would expect from a 4 star hotel. All the above was avoidable. They need to understand the basic principles of good and consistent customer service and empower and trust receptionists to make booking decisions. Will try different venue next time when over in January to see if they're any better.

213,An excellent place to stay in Dublin,"We always feel 'at home' at the Herbert Park. the Staff , Breakfast, and the Room Service are all top grade. The location is perfect for town or the South side and the rates are competitive.We have stayed there many times and have never been disappointed..",5,2015,11,17
213,Pretty Good,"From check in to departure the service is friendly and for the RDS stadium the location is beyond perfect.
However it's a bit too much like a business hotel for a weekend break, the bedding is not very high quality and the pillows that awful foam filled hard lump. I always wonder why hotels skimp on such an important item, after all they are in the business of selling sleep!!
In short if I was watching the rugby I would stay here but that's about the only reason. Others in or group were in the old Four Seasons which is now the Intercontinental. Now that is a hotel",3,2015,11,16
213,2015 Web Summit,"This was my second year attending the Web Summit and the second year staying at the Herbert Park. For this event which is massive in Dublin as a show, the Herbert is the Perfect location. You are literally 2 mins walk to the event. The park that is attached to the hotel is stunning for a morning or evening walk. Serenity within chaos :)

The hotel facilities are amazing. Higher end Business traveler style....clean, spacious, well maintained, efficient etc.....

The staff are FANTASTIC !!!!!!...they truly convey the warm, friendly and professional spirit of the Irish....always a smile, always happy to go out of their way to make sure you are well taken care of.

The hotel location for non Summit events is fantastic as well. A very nice 25 min walk into the heart of Dublin (nightlife, bars, historical etc...)

truly enjoyed my stay there in every way.

213,Consistently high standards,"A great hotel with excellent standards; always clean; excellent room standards; beautiful food and in a super location. Staff are always extremely friendly and helpful. Service at the bar can be a bit slow at times but once you're not under time pressure, no better place to relax and chill out !.",5,2015,11,16
213,"Great for location, poor for value. ","A fantastic location in Dublin it has promising initial, modern aesthetics. 

The bar area feels a little open to the elements and seems as though staff are not assigned to a designated area which resulted in our difficulty in getting anyone's attention. When we did, we were quite often forgotten. 

Breakfast service varied on the two days we stayed, with a lack of consistency to the food quality but the restaurant area was warm and comfortable. 

Our room was beautifully clean with a discreet efficient service and although tea and coffee could be requested at any time it was a little disappointing that there was no facilities in the room. 

If overall the hotel could pick up their attention to detail it would be a fantastic place to stay. 

",3,2015,11,16
213,Convenient for RDS,"This was our second visit to this hotel. It is located in the lovely Ballsbridge area of Dublin. Very convenient for the RDS, Aviva stadium and a 20 min walk into the city centre. We were attending a rugby game at the RDS which is about 100 metres away. Rooms are clean and modern. Breakfast is buffet style with a good selection. Staff are friendly and efficient. We would recommend this hotel and look forward to returning in the future.",5,2015,11,15
213,Great Hotel,"I  selected the Herbert Park Hotels ""Fabulous Package"" when booking my room for an overnight break with my wife, and a faboulous package it was indeed.

The hotels location is perfect, right in the heart of Ballsbridge with our restaurant (Rolys) just a quick step away and lots of great pubs around.

The hotels own bar was very nice, the foyer had lots of seating and if we had more time we would have enjoyed more time there.

Right from our arrival till we booked out, all the staff we met were very friendly and welcoming.
Our room was clean bright and comfortable, parking located below the hotel was ideal and we really enjoyed breakfast, which offered plenty of choice.
My only regret was we couldn't stay longer, and I look forward going back.",5,2015,11,13
213,The Herbert Park has upped it's game,"We stay in the Herbert Park Hotel on a regular basis as we like the location. Over the years we felt it had dipped slightly in quality (probably as a result of trying to keep it's head above water during the recession) but recently the hotel has upped it's game.

We stayed in a lovely room on the 5th floor on the fabulous package and had a really nice stay. Breakfast was excellent and the quality of offering had improved since our last visit. I always find the breakfast room too hot but given the fact that it is mostly glazing there may be little the hotel can do about this.

The hotel has been getting revamped recently and I like the overall look and feel. it is modern without feeling too sterile.

I felt we got good value and will be back. Thank you.",5,2015,11,12
213,A little bit Jekyll and Hyde,"Visited Herbert Park recently for a one day meeting on site, then a room for the night.

On arrival the reception area/foyer is attractive, modern and spacious. Went straight to meeting room rather than checking in. 

Meeting room (Lansdowne Suite 1) was also spacious, big projector and screen and hallelujah, a multiplug adaptor smack in the middle of the room (ridiculously uncommon for hotel meeting rooms), decent enough coffee and pastries in the room, still and sparkling water (warm). Wifi was terrible though, we were given a username and password but there are many networks to choose from and none of them worked at all. Ended up tethering to my iPhone for the duration. 
Once checked in however the guest wifi (free) did work, just none of the meeting room connections.

Lunch was pretty good, soup, selection of sandwiches and wraps/etc. with decent variety - enjoyed it.

Checked into the room, was booked through work but was not recognised as being on bill-back, nor had they used the company credit card it was booked with as a pre-auth so I had to pre-auth it again + 50EUR on check in.

Room 335 on 3rd floor, somewhat more dated than the lobby! Room is spacious, but I had no need for a bed bigger than a king size, as well as another somewhere between a single and a double. It did mean three bottles of water though so not complaining too much. Bathroom fine, shower over bath, never a fan of an oldish shower curtain to be honest, would prefer glass screen but clearly not the end of the world.  

Had a view over the air conditioning units etc. out back which wasn't brilliant. Minibar content was mediocre but very cheap for a minibar (see photo). Can't imagine they have had a refurb for a good 10 years or more.
No iron in room but a good old trouser press. Annoying for pressing a shirt, didn't seem to get hot so I went out creased. Couldn't find a guest services book anywhere either - needed it to see if reception could provide an iron/toiletries after airport security removed by more than 100ml of deodorant from my hand luggage. Eventually found it at the bottom of one of the multiple bedside tables (at floor level). There is a massive desk with a number of drawers - just put it there instead! 

Don't remember seeing a kettle either come to think of it. Definitely a hairdryer in there though.

The hotel bar was decent enough, well stocked and service wasn't bad, wasn't too horrifically priced either. Had a drink before we went out, and then on return were drinking until about 2am - decent night service, from about midnight I think. 

All in all I'd stay here again I guess but would want a competitive rate if work wasn't picking up the bill!",3,2015,11,12
213,Beautiful hotel with super service,"We stayed for a couple of days during The Web Summit 2015. Dublin was very busy, but the hotel was an oasis in the chaos. The staff were super friendly and helpful. The reception is beautiful. The rooms were spacious and very clean. I would stay there again.",5,2015,11,10
213,"Great location, very noisy","We stayed in Herbert PArk over Christmas 2014

the Christmasa day lunch was excellent in terms of food and service and overall the lobby food / service was very good

rooms are of a goods standard and well maintained.

super location just outside the city centre but close enough if you want a long walk to town

biggest problem is the level of noise in the hotel. even allowing for holiday activities the level of noise was very high e.g housekeeping slammed around the floors from 8.30 with no regard for guest. we complained to no avail,",3,2015,11,08
213,"Beautiful, convenient hotel",Stayed here for the Back To Our Past conference in October 2015. Shared a twin room with a colleague. All the modern amenities in a well-appointed room. Convenient location for the RDS center and nearby restaurants. Walking distance for the slowest of walkers! Did not get to explore the adjacent park but it looked interesting from the entrance. ,5,2015,11,08
213,Excellent Hotel for a Business Trip to Dublin,"Very nice and clean Hotel, with very gentle and helpful personnel. Actually very nice rooms with a high standard and very comfortable beds. I would immediately choose this hotel again if I have another trip to Dublin.
Only negative item - the hotel is quite expensive but after all worth the price.

Thank you very much for the hosting",5,2015,11,06
213,Great hotel at a good price,"Stayed at this hotel on their 'fabulous package'. Very good value, particularly for this area. From the time we checked in until we left, everything was great. Friendly & efficient check in, very good room & a delicious breakfast the following morning. What struck me mostly about this hotel is that it is evident money is still being spent on it, from the tall vases of fresh flowers at reception, the deep pile rugs & how clean & new it all looks. The park at the rear of the hotel is well worth a visit, especially at this time of year in autumn. Wouldn't hesitate to recommend this hotel & already looking forward to a return visit.",5,2015,11,03
213,Great location,"Stayed here for 1 night while visiting the RDS. The location is great 2 mins. walk to Merrion Road, within 5 mins walk to local restaurants and 3 mins. to the RDS. The room was lovely, very clean and spacious. Tea & coffee facilities are not provided in the room but can be ordered from room service at no extra cost. The staff are very friendly and courteous. We had lunch in the Terrace Lounge and the food was excellent. A great hotel to stay in.",5,2015,11,03
213,"Great Location for Dining, Sports and Access to Central Dublin","We have stayed here 4 times over the last year, 3 times booking interconnected family rooms and have always been very pleased with the accommodation, staff and food.

The hotel is located within easy reach of the Aviva Stadium, the RDS show grounds and is only a couple of miles from central Dublin. Another great boon for families is the close proximity of Herbert Park which has plenty of green space, football pitches, tennis courts and a well equipped play ground for the under 12s. For us one of the other great benefits of the hotel's location is that it is no more than 3 minutes walk from Roly's Bistro, one of Dublin's finest restaurants.

This is a firm favourite with all of us and our 8 year old will not consider staying anywhere else. She simply could not do without her own room and those marvellous continental breakfasts! Looks like we'll be stating here again and again...",4,2015,11,01
213,Great location and enjoyable stay,Stayed just the one night- a business trip. A very pleasant experience. Got a quiet room- just what I wanted. The hotel is nicely located in a good area and only pleasant stroll into the city centre. And the breakfast the next morning was delicious.,4,2015,10,30
213,"Excellent location, great service","I have stayed in the Herbert a number of times and my experience of the service has been great. Staff have been very helful and professional. Great rooms, clean and spacious. Food fantastic. Great location. 
Just one request....kettle in the rooms",5,2015,10,30
213,Customer service.....,"Stayed in the hotel, stayed 50 times in the past, found it great. This time I found the staff rude, inflexible and non engaging. Never again, the most ignorant people I have ever engaged with in my life. I can not think of a reason why I would ever stay in this place ever again. Special mention to the ""friendly"" Lukaz, DM, that is meant to be the Rock of sense. Loop the loop.",1,2015,10,29
213,Average hotel at best,"I recently returned to this hotel for a second time with my fiancé as we had been given a couple of gift vouchers so thought, why not?! However, we were once again underwhelmed. This hotel is in a lovely area and the rooms are clean but for the price it is over rated and it is just totally average. There is nothing wow about it to charge the price they do. The breakfast buffet was very good but we were not approached or offered tea or coffee on the second morning.",3,2015,10,28
213,Top Class Stay,"We stayed in the Herbert Park Hotel over the Oct Bank Holiday weekend 2015 and could not recommend the hotel highly enough. It was a busy weekend but the standards of the hotel did not drop right from check-in, the excellent bar staff and the standards of room service. Food in the lobby is excellent so well done to the chef and it is served with a smile from the staff at all times. The hotel is ideally located for local pubs..a special mention to the excellent Bridge and also the Italian Boschetta with its great atmosphere and also excellent service. All in all the Herbert Park is a hotel we would definitely return to and definitely recommend and it leaves its close ""continental"" neighbour in the shade for service and excellence with a lot less fuss.

213,Short break in Dublin,Very nice hotel. Loads of seating in the lounge area.  Very comfortable bed and delicious breakfast.  What more could you need for a overnight stay in Dublin.  One thing missing in the room though was tea/coffee making facilities which was a shame but wouldn't put me off returning as there was a complimentary bottle Prosecco and a bottle of water for each of us.  They even paid our 12 euro overnight parking.  Thank you Herbert Park,5,2015,10,28
213,Excellent rooms and friendly staff,"Location was excellent, 5 minute walk to exhibition centre & Roly's Bistro is awesome (must book). Friendly staff and excellent rooms. Quiet room and spacious.  45 minute walk to Dublin centre. Lovely park next door.",5,2015,10,26
213,Excellent hotel in great location.,"We booked this hotel the day before we travelled,(22-10-2015), as it had a really good offer for one night , which included bed and breakfast, a bottle of prosecco, and free parking in the hotels own underground car park. Staff were very friendly and helpful, room was excellent with a massive king size bed, and breakfast selection was of a high standard.The hotel adjoins Herbert Park, great for a walk/run, and is right beside the RDS, and a number of really good restaurants and pubs. Really enjoyed the whole experience and will definitely be back.",5,2015,10,24
213,Amazing hotel!,"I stayed here with my boyfriend as for one night before leaving the next day to go to Munich. I was amazed at how lovely the hotel was. Clean, fresh, bright and huge lobby and the rooms were exactly the same! Classic and tasteful decoration and very very clean. I will happily stay in this hotel again and again. If fact I'm back in there for a couple of nights after my Munich trip! Very much looking forward to it.",5,2015,10,24
213,Excellent Service,"This hotel was well appointed, with friendly and efficient service.  In particular, our friendly waiter, John, made us feel very much at home on the first day of our first overseas trip, and he was considerate and very knowledgeable.  We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at the Herbert Park Hotel.  The accommodations were beautiful, as well as the park outside on the grounds.  Would highly recommend staying here, and meeting John!",4,2015,10,23
213,"Nice Location, Greedy Management","I recently managed a trip for 17 US delegates to a workshop in Dublin and we stayed here at the suggestion of our hosts. The hotel is nice, the food is good, the location was convenient for our business. However, I made a mistake in our reservation and management insisted on charging us for extra nights when they were aware through earlier communications we were not using those rooms. We spent nearly 7,000 euro for our entire group yet they could not forgive this small error. Unlike other hotels that can accept mistakes and truly value their customers, the Herbert Park just wants your money. My recommendation is to be very careful if you choose to stay here. I know we'll never go back.",2,2015,10,23
213,Great hotel & great location,"We have stayed at the Herbert Park Hotel recently. From arrival to departure we have had the most pleasurable experience. The hotel is situated in Ballsbridge, which in itself has plenty to offer, bars restaurants and the RDS is across the road. The city centre is a 25 minute walk or a quick taxi ride.
All the staff are very professional, friendly, helpful and a pleasure to deal with. The Foyer/Reception area is spacious & decorated to a high standard. There’s a  lot of seating area to meet up with friends for lunch or a drink.
The bedrooms are spacious, spotless with comfy beds and great views looking out over Herbert Park. Dining experience is both excellent & relaxing, with great menu to choose from. Breakfast is superb with a choice of continental or full menu service, great for a relaxing Sunday morning read of the papers.
So whether sight-seeing,  shopping trip, going to a concert / show, business meeting, or just chilling out, the Herbert Park an ideal hotel for your stay.
We will definitely be back again…
Thank you to all the staff",5,2015,10,21
213,excellent hotel,"stayed last weekend and it was fabulous. Got upgraded to an executive suite, with complimentary bottle of prosecco in the room.  A lovey room overlooking the park which was very comfortable. The breakfast was great, staff were great, good parking facililties all in all I would give 10/10.",5,2015,10,20
213,Nice hotel. Needs renovation!,"The Herbert Park is a nice hotel, conveniently located near the main business district of Dublin, where all tech companies have their offices. The neighborhood is quite lovely and make time to walk around, weather permitting. The rooms are very spacious with a great bed and a very good working desk - key for business travelers like myself. The rooms and specially the bathrooms are in dire need of renovation, starting with the wallpapers, as my pics show. This really offset the hotel's cool amenities like the really good free Wi-Fi.

213,Great accommodation in the Ballsbridge neighborhood with proximity to downtown Dublin and the airport,"Clean, well-run, and highly accommodating hotel in Dublin.  Staff is very friendly.  Book in advance, as it can get quite full.  I've come to rely on this hotel whenever I'm on business to Dublin and look forward to my next stay.  Wi-fi login can be tricky to use.",5,2015,10,19
213,Good Location for Business or Pleasure,"I have stayed here on a few occasions and it never disappoints. Ideal location for both the RDS and The Aviva. Bedrooms are comfortable , Wi-Fi good , bar has a nice atmosphere & overall friendly efficient staff.",4,2015,10,19
213,Weekend Break,"A weekend break to visit family that lived nearby.  Hotel was spacious, spotless with friendly staff.  As said before, only downside was no tea/coffee facilities in your room.  Herbert Park behind the hotel provides pleasant and relaxing stroll.

      ",4,2015,10,18
213,Really great for the RDS or Landsdowne Rd,Stay regularly and never been disappointed . Ideal location for both the RDS and The Aviva. Breakfast pretty good and the bar busy on match days. Found it cheaper recently to book via the hotel itself as opposed to Internet comparison sites.,4,2015,10,17
213,Overall good place,"I've stayed at this hotel twice and it offers pretty nice rooms. The location is about a 20 minute walk from all the attractions and city center. The park next door is a good place for a walk or run.  The staff is very nice. 

Parking at the hotel overnight is about 50 euros, which is ridiculous. The breakfast is ok,  but that's about it. ",4,2015,10,15
213,Staff were wonderful,"We stayed here our first night ever in Ireland.  The hotel is in a great location near a beautiful park, restaurants, pubs.  The staff, especially John, was so willing to share the Irish culture with us.  We could not have asked for a better introduction to beautiful Ireland.",5,2015,10,15
213,excellent hotel in park setting,"Hotel is situated next to beautiful Herbert Park and not far from major shopping and central tourist sites.  Next to U.S. Embassy.  Quiet, clean, large room with good breakfast included.  Next door Kites Chinese restaurant is one of the best.",5,2015,10,15
213,Stay the night or else pay for Wifi,"""Every coffee-shop and bar in Dublin offers free Wifi but not the 4 star Herbert Park Hotel. If you are not staying (even though dining there) you will have to pay by the quarter hour for Wifi. Same goes for parking. I don't know anything about the food or amenities as I didn't linger. In the lounge a club sandwich is €14.50, a burger & chips or fish and chips, €19, and a pot of tea €4.70. But check your emails in the pub down the road and don't bring your car.",2,2015,10,15
213,"Great location, helpful staff!",We very much enjoyed our 3 night stay here. Nice quiet location and yet very convenient to central Dublin by bus which is picked up just around the corner. The hotel is clean and spacious but I really wish there was a kettle with tea and coffee to make in our room ( however we were given a plate of tiny chocolates each evening which was very nice). The staff were always helpful with directions and there are several pubs and restaurants within walking distance as well as convenience stores should you need something.,4,2015,10,14
213,Great value location,"Stayed here last month for the 1st time and was more than pleased.
The weekend in question most of the hotels were charging excessive amounts however the Herbert Park came in approx 30% cheaper than the competition 
The hotel excelled in customer service, cleanliness and value.
An excellent location only 10 minutes from central Dublin.

213,"Lovely hotel, but please provide kettle, teabags and coffee in room","Lovely, quiet hotel in a nice part of the city.  The rooms were very clean and spacious and the staff extremely friendly and helpful.  The minibar was well stocked, and not overly expensive.  My only complaint, and to me its a big one, is the lack of tea and coffee making facilities in the room.  Everything else was spot on, but I missed my complimentary morning cuppa as soon as I got up.",5,2015,10,13
213,I was at the hotel overnight during the Dublin Theatre Festival,"I have stayed in the hotel in the past - on my own and with visiting family from the US.  The hotel is stylish, in a very good neighbourhood in Dublin with good, fast public transport links by bus and commuter train to centre of Dublin less than 3 miles away.
Lovely lounge bar area that serves light food.  I ordered room service continental breakfast - good, hot and prompt. Generous bathrooms, good linens, and courteous staff.",4,2015,10,12
213,"a great experience, time and again!","Being a regular visitor of Herbert Pak Hotel , this short note is to inform business travelers that it is an excellent place to stay , with very friendly staff and a great accomodation. The park next to the hotel is a premium for a nice walk after a busy day.",5,2015,10,12
213,Overnight stay for business,Stayed one night for business in October.  Room was extremely spacious and had everything you could need.  Location is great for the RDS. Staff were friendly and efficient for check in and out.  Great little cafe just around the corner serving delicious breakfast.  Would definitely recommended and stay again.,5,2015,10,11
213,Best hotel in Dublin,"Herbert Park is absolutely my favourite hotel in Dublin.  Excellent, friendly staff and always a warm welcome.  Good for, great breakfast, and very conveniently located.  My 'go to' hotel, and highly recommended...",5,2015,10,11
213,Although it is a 4 star i honestly see it as a 5 star,"I have been in and out of Ireland for the past 4 years and have made sure that I stay in the Herbert park hotel every time I visit.
Staff are the most friendly and helpful people I have seen compared to the rest of the staff I have dealt with around Europe.
 After getting into an accident in Ireland the Herbert park made me feel like home when I got out of the hospital.
I must say if I had the say to judge the rating of stars I would give it a 5 star hotel with my eyes closed.",5,2015,10,11
213,Always again a pleasant experience,"I am regularly staying at the Herbert Park Hotel with my family. We are always coming back here because the international staff is welcoming and the atmosphere is friendly. The hotel is rather well located, right beside the park where we go to play football or go running. The Landsdown DART station is only a few min away to get into town or go south to Bray. Whether bar food, room service or breakfast, the food and service meets our expectations. The rooms are well-sized and quiet. Beds are great. Overall a consistently pleasant experience.",4,2015,10,11
213,Fantastic stay!!!,"My mother and I had a fantastic stay! Before booking the hotel I wanted to ensure that this stay would be special for us. All the public spaces and our room were as nice as would be expected in a highly rated hotel. I booked afternoon tea, requested special table that was organized and prepared without any hassle. Afternoon went as planned and my mother was excited.
The breakfast in the morning had everything you could wish for and I can't say anything bad about this hotel or my stay there. Enjoyed every minute there. Every request was answered. The stuff was very warm and helpful all the time. Only a little comment and observation - I’ve missed tea-making facilities.But overall - very much recommended.",5,2015,10,08
213,Always a very nice experience,"I'm a regular customer of the Herbert Park's. Always a very nice experience, whether rooms, staff, restaurant or location. If I have to find something that needs improving, that would be the TV system which is quite poor (list of channels or quality of reception) and not international customers oriented.",4,2015,10,08
213,Usual consistent high standard,My wife and I stayed at the Herbert Park for one night midweek. As always the reception staff were polite and helpful and we were checked in very promptly and went straight for dinner. The food was excellent and the waiting staff were pleasant and attentive as usual. Our room was spotless and very comfortable.  This is the normal high standard that we have experienced in the Herbert Park Hotel over many years. We stay in Dublin several times a year and always stay here due to its consistent high standard.,5,2015,10,07
213,Great holidays in a lovely hotel,"The Herbert Park hotel and it's staff made our holidays even better.When we arrived it was some confusion with our reservation, but it was dealt quickly and efficient. Front of house was very professional and after small glitch our issue was resolved and we felt very welcome.
Rooms absolutely amazing big and bright with great modern touch.
First evening spend in Herbert Park Hotel restaurant and I should say food was delightful. 
Breakfast buffet was really big and had great choice of food, as I'm not a morning person, found everything what I like.
Would I recommend this hotel? Yes!!! Definitely coming back next year ;)",5,2015,10,07

Breakfast was nice and overall not bad.",3,2015,10,07
213,The Worst Hotel Experience I Ever Hand In My Life,"I'm not one for putting reviews on Tripadvisour (I don't usually have the time) but it someones goes up and above the level of service, they deserve a mention and a well done on your good job so I do put a post.  This is the 1st time I ever had to take time out to do a poor report on a hotel stay, as I hate running a place down.   But I stayed in Herbert Park for 2 nights due to an unfortunate situation and just check out today, the staff are the most rude people you would ever meet, they give Dublin hospitably a bad representation, I can't even get into it, there actions upset me that much.  Along with that the rooms are old dated and smell, for a 4 star hotel I even had to call down and request a bathrobe they told me they'd be at 65e charge to used (Ridiculous) But they did send me up one and there was no charge, so appreciate that.  I left nearly 600 euros after my hotel stay for 2 days and I never got even a thanks.  Never have I ever did this to a business, but do not stay here, its old, dated, smelly, not that very clean, overpriced & the staff attitude is deplorable.  I checked into a neighbouring 5* hotel today for the next week + as I could not put up with the poor customers service standards of this hotel.",1,2015,09,28
213,Does Not Cater to Business Travellers....Package holiday hotel.  Clear stackém high movèm fast package holiday policy.,"The Herbert Park Caters to package holiday tours not business travellers.   Simple.  

The location of the Herbert Park is smack in the middle of Ballsbridge so for Tourist and business travellers the location is smashing.   The rooms are a bit dated, dented and tired but on par with many post crisis Dublin hotels.   The lobby  is large, spacious and generic....all so far would garner this hotel 3 or 4 stars.  

The 2 star rating is due to an unhelpful Desk staff. 

 I decided to combine a work trip with a family city-break.   When I first asked about which day activities I could send my family on while I was at work...they puffed, shrugged their sholders, then directed me to a shelf full of brochures told me to go figure-out for myself. (Photo Included)  I stay at 100+ hotels a year and regularly ask for suggestions from the Concierge or frontdesk.....From Nairobi to London and Mumbai to Moscow,  Staffs are universally kind and helpful.   The staff at Herbert Park,on this occasion, were not..  

The 1 star rating is for the following.  Given my heavy travel,  I prefer to have my meals made to order.  When I went to breakfast, at the Herber Park Hotel,  I was told there is a BUFFET ONLY policy for the restaurant.   I offered to pay buffet prices,  if they would make me a two fresh fried egg with beacon, which they refused.  The wait staff told me, I could only eat from the buffet.    I was welcomed to order `a la carte`  from the lobby bar but I would need to wait 35 minutes until the lobby bar opens. 

 When I raised the buffet only issue with the Day-Manager later, she said that the hotel has to feed 300 people a day so they make no acceptions  for any guest on special dietary request for what ever reason. I asked here if there was exceptions for dietary or religious reasons she said, ""No, buffets works for us.""

I pushed the issue and told the day manager  as a business traveler I have dietary concerns given the number of days a year I travel a year so would prefer not to eat from an open buffet,  she firmly said,""Sir you would be better off staying elsewhere in Dublin you next visit if you want to order breakfast from fresh from a kitchen, as I told you this system works WELL for the hotel. If we allow kitchen from one customer,  once another clients sees it then we would have to do it for all!""     I stopped the conversation after being clearly chasten  and being made to feel 7 years old in a school lunch-line wanting an extra pudding.  

It is  hard to debate after a customer does not come first statement.    

As a business traveler I will choose to go elsewhere in the future and am confident that the hotel I stay  will be more than capable an delivering a black coffee, two eggs over easy and beacon from the kitchen.

HERBERT HOTEL HINT #1: The SPAR down the street was able accommodate make to order egg and beacon request and providing much better customer service.

 I have included a picture of the buffet serving spoon having spent 1 hour a room temperature in its own special clumpy eggy juice, despite the day-managers claims of extremely high cleanliness standards.",1,2015,09,27
213,RobK Kerry ,"The sublime Herbert Park Hotel  has been a favourite of ours for a number of years. 

The hotel is a cool, clean, crisp, calm oasis situated on the edge of the magnificent Herbert Park in Dublin 's leafy Ballsbridge, yet only a short stroll from some excellent restaurants and pubs. The vibrant and bustling city centre is only a short drive away.

The ambience is one of understated, sophisticated elegance. Nothing tacky, no offensive piped music. 

The management and staff are to be commended for the excellent levels of customer care. 
We found all staff to be friendly,  welcoming and professional. 
Rommell, the manager on duty when we checked in , Lara and Egle at the front desk and the delightful Paula Coyle, who was our waitress in the restaurant on our first evening, and subsequently brought coffee and drinks to our room deserve mention. 

Having read some of the disparaging comments left by previous guests, I can only surmise,  that they, unfortunately for all, found themselves in the wrong place, at the wrong time! 

In a perfect world,  all hotels would be like this. ",5,2015,09,23
213,Very clean,"Stayed here over night for business meeting, lovely clean hotel with friendly staff, in a good location with nice surroundings, the breakfast was better than expected. Would recommend this hotel but not the cheapest!",5,2015,09,15
213,Biggest Waste of €400.00 EVER!!,"Arrived on the evening before my sisters wedding. All excited about the forth coming celebrations. NEVER were we asked for any credit card details for room charges.. and I stupidly assumed that they had these on record from time of booking... Door man did not understand the concept of keeping the wedding dress on the luggage trolley.. rolled over it on a number of occasions leaving us to do a DIY cleaning up job on the dress that night...The hotel did not offer tea and coffee making facilities in the room even though the rooms were €200.00 per night each. While the rooms were clean and of a adequate size.. they did not have any bath robes and were certainly not of a 4 star standard. Wifi was a night mare to use.. so we just gave up! We were  charged €4.95 per person service charge for tea and coffee leaving us to pay another €50.00 or there abouts for service charge (Because we did not request the facilities to be in our rooms at time of booking apparently.... one would assume that when paying this kind of money that you would not have to ask) and when the 4 sandwiches were delivered to the room there was another €42.00 charge that we had to pay there and then or the food would have been taken back.(Because our card details were not given at time of check in?? The hotel had these details from time of booking  and we were never asked for them at time of check in anyway) No extra pillows or blankets were available in the rooms (Aparently for hygiene reasons).. the breakfast table that we were put sitting at was not properly set for breakfast and had empty jugs, and used jam and butter containers on the table. This hotel in my mind has a cheek to call itself  4 star and I will certainly not be staying there again. So not only did we pay €400.00 for rooms, we also had another €50.00 or so to pay for service charge. In summary.. The Herbert Park hotel in my mind is not a 4 star hotel.. and the management leave a lot to be desired.. I have stayed in better Travel Lodges",1,2015,09,15
213,Difficult to Like,"I stay in  a lot of hotels for both business and pleasure so have an idea of what is pretty standard for business hotels in various countries.  While the Herbert Park should be a very good place to stay on a business trip it is full of irritations.

I stayed 5 nights at the hotel while in Dublin for some business meetings.  The hotel was chosen by someone else because it is in an area that has restaurants and pubs within walking distance.  We had previously staying at another hotel that while very nice did not have any food or drink that could be reached on foot except that inside the hotel.  

Firstly the good things about the Herbert Park.  The bedroom was large, spotlessly clean and well equipped.  The breakfast is ample and had a very good selection including all the elements of the full Irish breakfast plus the best natural yoghurt I have even eaten.

There is a gym in the basement that is far too small with only 3 cardio machines but the equipment is modern and the gym is clean and well maintained.

That aside there were any number of small things that made my stay unsatisfactory.  Firstly, the wifi is about the clumsiest system it has ever been my misfortune to use.  You have to create a user ID and password and re-enter them each time you go back online.  The wifi is one of the few things in the hotel that is free and I can only assume that they are paranoid about someone stealing some of their free bandwidth.  

There was no kettle in the room to make a cup of coffee.  When asking for one I was told by the receptionist that there were ""no kettles anywhere in the hotel"" but they could always bring coffee to my room for a charge of 4.95 euros.  When I questioned the cost I was told that was for a pot - but it wasn't possible to get just 1 cup.  The coffee when it came was instant which is a pretty poor show for that cost.  

I didn't order a newspaper for the morning because it was not offered at check in.  When I asked about it I was told that someone could go out and buy one for me - at an extra cost.

I needed an adapter for my US electrical gadgets having foolishly forgotten mine.  No problem - we can sell you one for 14 euros - the same gadget I later saw at the airport for <8 euros.  

You want a small meeting room for the day?  No problem - that will be 200 euros - for a room that seated only 6-8 people which is unfortunately the smallest and cheapest meeting room they have.  You want coffee in the meeting room - sorry that isn't included but of course we can supply it at extra charge.  You want fancy coffee at breakfast - we can supply that too but at an extra charge of course.

The final straw was when I checked out without closely examining my credit card receipt and later discovered that the bill had been charged to my card in US$ rather than Euros.  Anyone knows that you never accept a US$ charge in another country because the exchange rate is terrible and there are additional fees added by the company that provides the ""service"".  Shops and restaurants will often offer the alternative currencies but I have never had anyone charge in US$ without asking.  I assume the hotel must get a kick back somewhere along the process or perhaps, to put it in the best light, their receptionists just don't care.  

Overall, I really did not like much about the Herbert Park and recommend not staying there.  I will certainly try never to have to do so again when returning to Dublin on business.",3,2015,09,08
213,Nice hotel in good location,"The Herbert Park is a nice, modern hotel in a great location in Ballsbridge with underground parking. The rooms are bright and modern but inexplicably for a four star hotel, they have no tea/coffee making facilities in the room although there is a small notice advising visitors that they can order beverages in their room for €3.50 per person. My room-only rate was €165 and it was €12 extra for the overnight parking.",4,2015,09,05
213,Lived up to it's 4 stars,"A very nice hotel.  The front desk asked our preference in bed because he saw we were booked for 2 singles.  We ended up with a king!  Because we were coming from the States, we arrived at the hotel late morning and we were able to check in.  So glad because we really needed a nap.  The lounge serves great food and the atmosphere is pleasant.  The staff was so nice and attentive (actually everywhere we went in Ireland, the staff was exceptional).  The hotel is next to the Herbert Park which is a very nice walk.  Quiet and clean.  What a wonderful stay for a few days!",4,2015,09,02
213,Good Value and helpful Staff,"Had a 5 night recent stay and found the hotel a real value and the staff went out of their way to make things work.

Transportation and multiple places to eat and get supplies confirmed I will stay here again 

Even though it is a 10 minute ride to St.Stephens Green or the other side of the Quay I would say the quiet atmosphere and access to amenities more than made up for it",4,2015,09,01
213,Overnight stay in Dublin,"I have stayed in this hotel on several occasions over the last 2 years for events in Dublin City . I have to highly recommend this hotel,the rooms are clean and well appointed with very comfortable beds and free wifi .the location is superb in the heart of South City with a 15 min walk into town or nearby dart services/ buses.  The breakfast is excellent and there is food available all day in the comfortable foyer area. But the best is by far the management and staff in particular the tall blood Lithuanian manageress whose name has slipped me. She recognised and greets return customers and looks after everybody extremely well.",5,2015,09,01
213,"Nice, clean hotel in Dublin","Clean, green environment, quiet hotel in Dublin. The room is well equiped with free wifi, safe box, large desk to work with 2 usb chargers. Bathroom with tub is great.
Missing stuffs : coffee machine and foreign tv channels",4,2015,08,29
213,Central Ballsbridge,Lovely stay in a lovely hotel. Great location in ballsbridge. Worth a trip to Rolys just round the corner and lovely pubs nearby. Disappointed with the lack of tea/coffee facilities in the room...a charge of €4.95 each time...not as expected. €12 for car parking also. Otherwise a great hotel. ,4,2015,08,22
213,Always my favorite in Dublin,"This is always the hotel I stay when I travel in Ireland. Great location and the friendliest, most helpful staff. The rooms are  the best hotel rooms in Dublin city center and a hearty Irish breakfast . Have never been disappointed ! View over the park is spectacular especially when the weather is good ",5,2015,08,22
213,Nicely done and reasonably priced,"The rooms are of a reasonable size, and appear recently refurbished. Little touches, such as sufficient flat storage space, are there, which is nice. Just next to the Ballsbridge village area, so convenient to restaurants, etc. - though a longish walk/short taxi ride to the more famous tourist parts of town. Right on the very nice Herbert Park.",4,2015,08,22
213,One of the best,"Have stayed at this great hotel on numerous occasions before and my most recent visit didn't disappoint either.
Has to be one of the best situated hotels in Dublin with the beautiful  Herbert Park on your doorstep, lively pubs and restaurants in abundance and easy access either by foot or bus into the city centre.
Rooms are very comfortable however slightly disappointed there is no tea & coffee making facilities in the room, additional charge for this! Car parking is also extra @€12 per night so add to your room cost if on a budget.
Fantastic hotel to enjoy everything Dublin has to offer, wouldn't stay anywhere else!",5,2015,08,19
213,Great hotel,"I stayed here recently with my mom and sister. I have to say the room decor was the nicest I've sent in a hotel in a long time. Great furnishings, colourful wall paper and good sized beds.it's also in a great location that you're within walking distance to the city but in a lovely little nieghbourhood with some great bars and restaurants and a park next door.",4,2015,08,17
213,"Smart hotel,a bit soulless close to great choice of restaurants","Stayed for one night in August,on route to Wicklow.
It is about 10 minutes from the centre of Dublin but very , very close to some great restaurants in Ballsbridge.
Parking is easy,although they take €12 for overnight-more and more hotels seem to be adopting this money grabbing ritual.
The foyer is stark,minimalist and not particularly welcoming. Staff were professional and helpful.
The room was comfortable,no tea making facilities though which is another irritating trend in some of the more upmarket hotels. I do not want to have yo through the chore of ordering room service just for a cuppa!
Had a good nights sleep so checked out reasonably happy.
The Hotel is within a 2 minute walk of two very,very good restaurants- Kite's Chinese,one of the best in Ireland and Roly's Bistro- very famous in Dublin",4,2015,08,15
213,"Comfortable, efficient, no frills","Stayed for one night on a business trip to Dublin. Front desk staff were very good and professional - very helpful in checking us in early and throughout when we needed directions, holding luggage etc. Rooms are comfortable with a good size bathroom, but no table and very few sockets to be able charge a phone! No kettle either which was a surprise. Breakfast is a very decent selection of hot and cold food served in a good size dining room with attentive staff. There is a taxi rank just outside. Overall had a very comfortable stay here and if you need to be in this part of Dublin, can highly recommend.",4,2015,08,09
213,Nice hotel in a lovely park ,"The hotel is nice within a lovely park where you can enjoy your breakfast in a quiet and peaceful place. The bed was comfortable and the room was clean even though I would have expected table to put my personal things. And also maybe coffee or tea as complementary according to the standard of the hotel. The wifi was so so. 
For business purpose no desk in the room. Good full breakfast. The team is pro but nothing more. ",3,2015,07,31
213,The Hotel fullfill all our expectations,"It was our first time in Ireland, we were travelling with my wife for tourism trip. The location of the hotel is in a very nice area, very close to big green park where you can walk or make excersices and 12 minutes walking to down town. Our room was a king bed which was perfect, clean, quite and free wifi. Our trip from SouthAmerica took aprox 30hs,so when we arrived to the hotel we were really tired and check in was very fast and bed quality was fantastic for recovering our air
One issue to remark is their dinner restaurant, waiters service was perfect, always close to your needs but not so close to disturb your privacy and the food was fantastic, price was reasonable for the hotel level. I am remarking restaurant quality because from may business traveller experience usually hotels do not have a good restaurant
One additional issue that I like to mention was that we decided to stay one night more and the manager made an special discount for that additional night, saying that they expect that we could come in near future. Usually hotels take advantage of the fact that you do not want to change the hotel for only one night and apply an overcharge on your room fare.
Regarding breakfast I would rather recommend to skip it and go to other places near by, which are good and much cheaper",4,2015,07,29
213,Breakfast is Great!,"Our last night in Dublin we stayed here. Very modern and clean hotel. There isn't much to walk to near by except for a little park. The best part of the hotel was the breakfast! Tons of choices - Milk, juices, smoothies, cereal, muffins, pastries, a nice variety of hot food. Great service and very clean hotel. We arranged a taxi to the airport at the front desk (25 Euro). The receptionist was very helpful and the taxi was on time. ",5,2015,07,28
213,Nice hotel for business trips,"Very good breakfast with everything you could wish for!
Good service at the reception desk. Standard rooms (like in most other business hotels). The price is on the high side compared to other hotels that offer the same quality.",4,2015,07,27
213,Pleasant hotel and pleasant staff,"Had a one nighter here about two weeks ago. Typically I wouldn't stay in Dublin 4 as a lot of the hotels cost more than I like to pay. However, Dublin's hoteliers seem to have got very greedy lately so this luxurious residence even seemed good value on the night in question. €12 to park overnight is a bit extreme. Service in the bars and at breakfast were good (as was the breakfast) and the ambiance in the reception area where I met some customers and did some work the next day was good. I can't really put my finger on it but the whole experience just somehow lacked any spark. I would not rule out going back to check it out again.",4,2015,07,26
213,Excellent hotel,"We stayed in this hotel for one night while up at the ed sheeran concert. The hotel is situated in Ballsbridge. An ideal location if you want to be near the city centre but not in the middle of it. The hotel itself was lovely, very modern and clean. The staff were exceptional. They could not do enough for us. The room was also great. A good size room with a massive bed, bathroom was a normal size. We had a lovely view looking out over the park. The hotel had left a plate of chocolates/ macaroons/ nut in the room for us after we arrived, there was a paper left under the door in the morning as well which is a nice additional touch. I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone looking to stay in Dublin. a taxi into town only cost 13 euros. The only down side to the hotel is that you have to pay for parking but it was only 12 euros for the night. My scoring of the price of the hotel probably is not a fair representation as we stayed on the night of the Ed Sheeran concert when all hotels unfortunately upped their prices however this was still the cheapest hotel when we booked. All in all a great stay in a 4 star hotel that could in my opinion be a  star hotel.",5,2015,07,26
213,Upscale hotel,"Very nice hotel. Definitely an upscale hotel, all the amenities . The showers were great. The hotel bar was very trendy but also had a lobby type area that was very relaxing. I would recommend wearing dress clothes if you plan on eating there. The staff will treat you much nicer if you do as well.",5,2015,07,22
213,Nice business hotel in  the city at a good location,"Nice spacious rooms. 4 star hotel standard.
 Breakfast buffet is good and tasty.
A lot of varieties .
Wifi is ok.
If u need a taxi just let the front desk know. And they will callup a taxi for you.
30euro taxi from airport to the hotel.
Herbert park is just next to the hotel. Beautiful park.

Huge lobby.
Samsung smart tv is the best thing in the hotel. You can connect you phone to the television remotely for video on the tv.",5,2015,07,18
213,Sterile/Hostile - worst hotel of the summer.,"Where do I begin? Snobbish, faceless, soulless, more reminiscent of those Ibiza sprawling eyesore hotel complexes. I thankfully only had one night in the place, I don't think I could have happily stayed longer. I'd got the place cheapish on Booking website, as it was a sort of impromptu event, booked late and I had limited choice of hotels. It truly thinks it's a lot better than it is. Wifi is awful - no tea/coffee to use when working on laptop in the evening before bed ( but they'd get you a cuppa for a fiver, they say on a note beside your bed!). They had veggie food in the restaurant, but it was adequate at best. The only kind thing I can say really was that the air conditioning was a boon on the hottest day of the summer. The staff were the worst aspect, however. Seldom do you see people who genuinely don't give a toss about being welcoming or even remotely helpful. If you dress up like a Kardashian and splash money around, I'm sure you'll like this place and they'll like you. Personally, I hated it on a multitude of levels. I like hotels with personality, where they get to know you and you them. This place has nothing but big rooms and no soul. I've noticed a lot of reviews mention the awful staff - wouldn't you wonder why they don't train them to respect all their customers and not just the ones who look as though they'll get very drunk and drop a lot of show-off money?   ",2,2015,07,18
213,Repeat Business Guest,"As a regular traveller, user and guest of the Herbert Park, I am always blown away by their friendliness of everyone at the hotel, the facilities and exceptional service - I would without question recommend the hotel for business or pleasure ! Breakfast is gorgeous, rooms are always fresh and amazingly clean / that coupled with the most professional and friendly staff makes every stay pleasant. ",5,2015,07,15
213,Beautiful Hotel,We stayed in this hotel for a gig in the 3Arena. We couldn't recommend it enough. The rooms were beautiful and the staff were so helpful and friendly - we will definitely be back. Thank you for a lovely stay (and the breakfast is amazing),5,2015,07,15
213,"Great service, within walking distance of centre","This was our second visit to the Herbert Park Hotel, it was a lovely stay.  We arrived early and our room was promptly prepared with no fuss.  The park nearby is worth an evening stroll.  We stayed in a triple room as we had our daughter and it was a perfect size.  We walked to and from the city centre, nice walk via cafes and of course bars!",5,2015,07,14
213,1 night stay,"My husband and I stayed here Sat 11 July as we were attending a concert in the 3arena. The hotel appealed to us as it offers an overnight indulgence package which features a glass of prosecco and canapés in their Terrace Bar, breakfast to your room and a 2pm checkout. The rooms were clean and comfortable. However the €4.95 charge for tea/coffee to be delivered to your room was outrageous as there were no tea making facilities in the room. There were however complimentary bottles of Ballygowan water by the bedside. We just wanted a quick bite to eat before the concert so we availed of our complimentary prosecco and canapés and enjoyed a main course of beer battered cod and chips which was both sizeable and tasty. Breakfast was delivered to our room the next morning at our requested time. It was average fare. We are frequent visitors to Dublin but we cannot see ourselves returning to this hotel as we prefer a livelier more welcoming establishment and this hotel is clinical, business like and lacks character. It is however a good spot if attending an event in the almost adjacent RDS. Beware however of the €12 overnight parking charge which we avoided in our package but was applicable to other guests.",3,2015,07,13
213,Nice hotel close to centre of Ballsbridge,"We got an executive room weekend package including parking.  The room overall was large with a separate corridor to the extra large bathroom.  However, the bedroom was quite small as a result (for an executive suite).  The corridor doubles as an interconnection to the next room, so it doesn't add to your bedroom space.  The bed was a 6ft superking and was comfortable.  The air-conditioning was noisy but you needed it as the room got very warm.  The package came with chocolates and Prosecco and we were delighted to get a second bottle on the second night. Breakfast was included in our package and the charge for room service was an extra €6.50. 
The lifts look a little worn maintenance wise, but the hotel overall was not shabby.  
The foyer is nice with good area for relaxing, watching TV or ordering food or drinks.  Only used the dining room for breakfast but its a very nice room looking out on Herbert park.  
The other views are not that interesting, you are only looking out at an office block (from the hotel front and our room only.  (I'm sure there are views of Herbert Park from other rooms).  Taxi's are easy to catch into town from here (€7-8). 
Service was good overall.  Reception and foyer area staff were attentive and nice.",4,2015,07,13
213,Nice relaxing stay,"Stayed this week on business, and having stayed in a number of hotels in Ballsbridge, I would say that this is as good as any. Staff friendly and discreet, rooms very nice with good lighting and appropriate furniture for working.. All in all very good. Will stay again..even if the bar is a bit quiet...",4,2015,07,10
213,Well Located Efficient Hotel,"Had the occasion to stay here for a Dublin Concert, Clean, Modern, well run hotel. Located in Dublin 4 which by and large is a very secure safe location. Surrounded within a short walk of a number of well known restaurants and bars.",4,2015,07,08
213,Not worth the money!,"This is a very smart hotel beside the RDS Dublin but it gave me the impression that you were lucky to be staying there, not that they were anxious to provide a service to the customer! 
All but one of the Reception staff was polite but snooty and to stay in this place which is NOT cheap, you pay an extra €12 per day for the privilege of parking your car with them!
One of my party wanted a pint of milk in the evening and for that we were charged €2:70 without room service, i.e. we collected it ourselves from the bar.
A continental breakfast is another €10 each on top.
Most people are out all day sightseeing, so the glamorous front entrance while smart, is not necessary for a comfortable stay. Definitely ""Rip off Ireland"" Hotel.",3,2015,06,30
213,Mr,"Great location, high stadards throughout, well managed.superb breakfast offering,had barfood on both evenings which was of very good quality with prompt efficient service.No hesitation in recommending this fine property.",5,2015,06,30
213,Inflexible and Overpriced!,"When we received a gift of a voucher for this hotel, we were excited so travelled to Dublin this weekend, I had booked through booking.com in case I needed to cancel (young children) so this was my first obstacle at reception, she hesitated to take my €250.00 voucher until she checked with a manager as I booked through booking.com ( a third party ), she eventually said it was ok, then I had requested a cot for my 21mth old and I also asked for a pull out bed for either my 5 yr old or 7yr old, the other would've slept with us, she said she could do this but within 5 mins of going into our room, the front office manager called to say that they could not fit another bed into the room, this had to be a joke, there was no compensation or flexibliliy, I ended up having to ask for quilts to make a bed on the floor for 2 nights! Breakfast is an outrageous price at €19.50 for full irish and €15.50 for continental. And parking is €12.00 per night. This hotel is way overpriced and not one bit flexible. We will not be recommending it as it is not family friendly and its way overprice!",3,2015,06,29

213,"Great location, nice hotel.","The Herbert Park is a nicely appointed hotel. I’ve stayed there a couple times for work, and the service and accommodations are quite nice. 

The continental breakfast is pricey, but above average, and the adjacency to both RDS and Aviva Stadium – as well as the easy walk to the city centre make it convenient and not right downtown (it’s about a mile and a half to the Grafton/Trinity area.) 

Walking in the park has become a highlight of my evenings, and there are plenty of dining options close by. I will return, given the opportunity.

",4,2015,06,17
213,inflexible and over priced,"I am staying at the hotel tonight at a very expensive rate.  it will be my 10th stay there and I have other ones booked.  I called yesterday 20 hours before earliest checkin to cancel.  they would not do it without full charge.  they have won this stay, but will be moving my other bookings away from them.",2,2015,06,17
213,A top class stay in Dublin,"We recently spent a weekend at the Herbert Park Hotel in Dublin. The front of house staff were extremely friendly on arrival and we were given an excellent room on the fifth floor. The cleanliness through the hotel is on a par with any five star hotel we have stayed in both in Ireland and Europe so top marks to accommodation. It was a really busy weekend but at no point the standards in the hotel drop. The bar food is top class and beats more highly rated restaurants in the centre of Dublin with an exceptional terrace bar staff who could not do enough for you. The hotel is within walking distance of many excellent restaurants in Ballsbridge and we will definitely return. Keep up the good work!

213,"Average at best, overcharging at worst.","After the Ireland-Scotland football game at Lansdowne Road on Saturday 13th June 2015, we met friends who were staying here, paid over €200 for average food and drinks over the course of 4 hours, and then they charged us €20 for parking! Staff looked less than happy, reception was not receptive, especially when we asked for any explanation of the €20 parking charge.Lobby is poorly furnished for food service, and noisy. I have not received any response from their Facebook page since I raised this. Overall, a bad experience.",2,2015,06,15
213,Fantastic,Had a great time here. Stayed for a match in the aviva perfect location. Food excellent and rooms fab. We all ate lunch here something for everyone. Great atmosphere in the bar at night. Will definitely stay here again. Staff lovely all in all a great stay,5,2015,06,14
213,Nice Hotel but not outstanding,"We stayed here on 7th June 2015 in an Executive Room on 5th floor which advertised a Jacuzzi Bath and large bathroom. Unfortunately this was not the case, it was a small bathroom with a standard sized bath with 6 jacuzzi jets and the shower head attached overhead. In other 4* hotels we've had a large bathroom with two sinks, large separate shower and large jacuzzi bath...this was nowhere near as good. The furniture and carpets were very dated and the facilities as a whole were clean but nothing had a real wow factor. The hotel is a half hour walk from Dublin city centre (or a 15 min taxi ride which boggles me). The best thing was the breakfast in bed (despite calling us to ask if wanted coffee, then forgetting to brings the coffee). Breakfast was delicious but I don't think we'll be back.",3,2015,06,10
213,Very nice hotel,"Arranged by CIE tours. Beautiful hotel with very nice rooms. Staff were excellent. Walking distance to many restaurants and pubs. Breakfast provided was extensive with both hot and cold selections. Room good size and spotless. In room coffee pot would have been nice addition,",5,2015,06,09
213,Lovely stay,"Just returned from two nights stay in this hotel. We arrived very early and the lady on reception was more than happy to get our room ready for us while we waited in the bar. However we said we were happy to go off and explore Dublin if they could just store our luggage, she did this and even had them delivered to our room. We stayed in an executive room, lovely light and airy with a view over the park. It was very quiet and we had the use of bathrobes and slippers and each morning were left a small box of chocolates, lovely! Tea and coffee was complimentary in an executive room but had to be ordered, for me facilities to make drinks in the room would have been better. We also received a newspaper each morning. We opted to take breakfast in our room, a little pricey at €50 for two but a lovely treat and of a good quality. All in all a very good visit.
",4,2015,06,07
213,Brilliant hotel ,"I stayed last night for meeting today. Receptionist, Elgi was cheerful, helpful and I wish to thank her for upgrading me from single room to large fantastic  double room. Bed very comfortable, bathroom and shower great. Wide choice for breakfast. Regular bus service around the corner to take you into town. Would definitely recommend Herbert Park Hotel ",5,2015,06,04
213,Very good hotel,Very good hotel and very nice location in a beautiful park where to run or walk. Good solution for business. Only the gym machines are really bad and not enough for a 4 stars hotel. In case in the future I have to go in Dublin likely I will book again.,4,2015,05,30
213,Great Hotel,"Great Hotel modern contemporary, the staff were professional , friendly and helpful, the room was very clean especially the bathroom (this is where most hotels fail) perfectly located for us as we were going to the US embassy
Would recommend this Hotel and Amoma.com

213,Nice Stay,This is a very nice hotel that doesn't do anything out of the ordinary but does everything well. It's very close to downtown Dublin easily reached by bus or cheap cab fares. If I go back I would stay there in a heartbeat,5,2015,05,26
213,Getaway weekend,The hotel staff at reception were helpful and gave assistance when booking a meal at a nearby restaurant and also assisted with any other queries re Dublin during the weekend. The room was spacious and the bed was comfortable  - one drawback was the lack of provision for tea/coffee making facilities.,5,2015,05,26
213,One night stay to attend a gig,"The staff are friendly and helpful, the room was very clean. We checked in and out very quickly. It has on site parking which cost €12.00 for one day. It is a perfect location if attending a function at the RDS as it is directly accross the road. It is a short walk to the DART station which will get you into town in a few minutes.",5,2015,05,24
213,Good but not amazing,This hotel is fine if you are on a business trip. Its not really plush or particularly trendy but its clean and comfortable and more luxurious than a typical chain hotel. Rooms are comfortable but little extras that you expect in a better class of hotel like robes and slippers or conditioner. We had some issues with slow service or the wrong food being ordered. I wouldn't rush back here if i was staying in Dublin as there are lots of other places to stay but if i was here again for business it would be fine.,3,2015,05,18
213,"fair hotel, needs some work with the staff","Stayed here with the CIE tours. Our room was clean, but had a little bit of trouble with the bath tub being so deep etc. I usually dont write picky little things such as this but the shower pushed water out everywhere as well.  Not sure why. Bathrooms are really small, but we are used to that sometimes when traveling. Just a heads up for everyone. Did not care for the location of the hotel, kind of out and not near alot of things. The staff were very hit or miss! Some staff were nice, helpful and others acted like they could have cared less if you were there. Seemed some of the male staff were very curt, one word answers etc. However, we did have a very nice lady named Lara,  which she helped us tremendously by calling a restaurant and the main CIE tours to see if they could deliver my camera bag i had left at one of the restaurants. She came thru for us and was very pleasing. One of the male front desk staff told my husband that there was no where around the hotel to get a bite to eat, no restaurants, no pubs. Well, right around the corner from the hotel were three pubs to eat that we found on our own, but it would have been  helpful to have staff know what is available in the area for visitors to eat. I know some of the people in our group called down to get ice at the main desk and had to waited 45 minutes before anyone would attend to them. This is definitely a business hotel.",2,2015,05,15
213,Business Meeting and one night stay,"the hotel is very much a business hotel, it is clean and functional but lacks character.  Check-in was challenging, I had managed to leave my credit cards at home and asked if my wife could pay with her card over the telephone, was advised this was not possible as they had to send a form to be completed which my wife would have to fill in, scan and e-mail back (This was not going to work as we had no way to scan the completed document).  I was told electronic bank transfer was not accepted, leaving the only route to pay being cash, I was short by 4 Euro's - Luckily I was able to borrow the money from a colleague, else I guess I would have sleeping elsewhere that night !  Worst check-in ever, I appreciate I caused the problem but the complete lack of sympathy and support from hotel was not helpful.",3,2015,05,13
213,My Favorite Dublin hotel,"I find this hotel to be one of the best in Dublin. It's got everything - wonderful location in quiet Ballsbridge yet close to city center; excellent breakfasts in a delightful setting; great bar; lovely, spacious guestrooms in which to work or relax. Best of all, the staff are all so helpful and gracious. I had to leave early on the last morning of my stay and I got a lovely continental breakfast tray served in the lounge - a lovely finish to my stay.",4,2015,05,13
213,Outstanding,"Have just stayed 3 nights in the Herbert Park hotel - it was the first trip I have made to Dublin and was looking for a central location - easily accessible by coach from the airport and close to the city centre. The hotel was bright, spacious and modern. The food was excellent and the staff were outstanding. The location perfect for all the activities I had planned.
I would highly recommend this hotel if you are planning a trip to Dublin .",5,2015,05,12
213,Good reliable hotel in great location,Just had another mini break staying in the Herbert Park Hotel. Staff friendly and helpful and rooms always comfortable. Great for nearby eateries (Roly's for example) buzzing bars and the RDS with regular events or you can relax in the Park behind the hotel. On main bus route into City Centre though it only takes around 20 mins to walk if you are up for it! Free Wifi in rooms.,4,2015,05,09
213,Nice hotel but the staff need work......,Stayed here for business and had my Team with me. One of my Team was very ill and was treated appallingly. Paula called and offered to investigate. I haven't heard back. Shame as have stayed here a few times. Can't anymore I'm afraid. Not a four star hotel.,2,2015,05,09
213,Have to pay for parking. Nice Hotel but needs to look into their staff,"Stayed here for one night we had an executive room but our friends we booked in with booked standard rooms and there was no difference in either. The room was still comfortable and extremely spacious. Bathroom facilities not great but you did get bottled water at your bedside.
The staff were very hit or miss! Some staff were so nice and couldn't do enough for you and others were extremely rude and acted as if everything was an ordeal for them (one waitress in particular working in the lunch area beside the hotel lobby), which really left down the hotel and the nice staff that they do have.
The breakfast staff were the exception and made breakfast very enjoyable I wish I had of asked for one waitresses name as she was amazing at making us all feel welcome. 
Lovely breakfast and lunch food served in the hotel, we didn't have dinner so cant comment on that.
A big fault I found was even if your staying in the hotel you have to pay for parking but I think that is getting more typical with Dublin city hotels.",4,2015,05,06
213,Lovely time at Herbert Park,"Had a lovely time at Herbert Park on a family occasion in Dublin.  Very central easy to get to and park. Will be back.  Really enjoyed a morning stroll after breakfast in the Herbert Park which is adjacent to the hotel.  
              
              ",5,2015,05,06
213,"Excellent hotel, helpful staff","We stayed here on St Patrick's day and it was good value considering every other hotel in the city had inflated their prices.
Staff were very helpful, advising us on car hire and offering to store our luggage. They were able to find us a room even though we were very early for check in. 
The room was compact but had everything we needed - bed was comfy, pillows a bit flat but otherwise the room was high quality and the shower was strong.
We ordered coffee in our room - 3.50EURO for two cups and biscuits (although we actually got 5 decent sized cups out of the cafetiere) which was a hangover treat. Wifi was easy to access and fast. 
We walked from the hotel back into the centre of Dublin which took about half an hour strolling which wasn't too bad at all.",5,2015,05,04
213,Good business hotel in great location,"We stayed at the Herbert Park Hotel for 5 days and really enjoyed the hotel.  The only glitch was the bed and pillows were a bit under quality.  The service, staff and location were great.  Visiting the garden was a great break.  Downtown Dublin is only a 20 minute easy walk.  There are several good pubs and restaurants in the area as well.",4,2015,05,01
213,Excellent hotel; excellent location,"I cannot fault this hotel in any way. Excellent location, excellent staff and stunning views of Herbert Park from the breakfast room. This hotel is located very close to the city centre without and only minutes of a walk away from the RDS and Aviva Stadium. Only 5-10 minutes into the centre via taxi and located on the main bus routes. I frequently stay in Dublin and in Ballsbridge in particular. This hotel is by far the best 4 star in the area. Reception area, bar and rooms were all excellent. Great room rates available also.",5,2015,04,28
213,Pleasant,"Stayed for one night in April 2014 - room & bathroom a little outdated but lobby and restaurants nice, bright & clean. Had food in lobby one evening which was very tasty and was served very quickly and efficiently.  Friendly staff both in Reception & Bar. Very bad view from room looking out onto a wall.",4,2015,04,27
213,Elegant not stuffy,"The Herbert Park Hotel in Dublin is located in the embassy section of the city. The lobby is an ambling and comfortable area, with a good bar and a comfortable atmosphere. The rooms are spacious, have a comfortable feel, and are quite well appointed and luxurious. The entire hotel has a good and stylish feel to it, though without stuffy formality. It is formal enough to have class, but informal enough to be comfortable. The night's stay comes with a breakfast buffet that is quite good, and the dining area is a very nice room.

Internet service is among the best of any hotel, with very speedy wi-fi that easy streams. Plus, the price is right - it is free.

The gym is rather pathetic, with four paltry machine adjacent to the parking lot, but given the quality of the hotel in general, I'd say that unless this is really important to you, it shouldn't be a real deficit.

The staff is efficient, courteous, and polite.

Doing work in the room is no problem, between the excellent internet service, a comfortable desk, and good power supply, with a hotel-furnished surge suppressor with five outlets and two USB ports - very thoughtfully arrayed work area.

All in all, a really comfortable and relaxing hotel for business and pleasure trips.",5,2015,04,26
213,Great Hotel!!,"The first impression of this hotel is lovely! The reception & bar areas are really nice, well kept and clean!
The room I had on the 3rd floor was spacious, clean and comfortable. They provide a tv, hairdryer, soap, shower gel, shampoo, moisturiser and a shower cap and there were several towels. The bed was lovely and comfortable although it was 2 single beds pushed together but as I was alone it didn't really matter as I only slept on 1 side anyway! The only let downs in the room were my shower wasn't the greatest (room 319) and there is no tea/coffee making facilities in the rooms although as they provide 24 hour room service I suppose they don't want people making their own tea.
Now for the breakfast.....it was one of the nicest I have ever had! The usual hot stuff you would expect eggs, bacon, black pudding etc... but also with pancakes, poached eggs & omelettes made to order too. The continental side was my favourite though......meats, cheeses, fresh fruits, cereals and even smoked salmon which was delicious! There was also a range of different breads, pastries and croissants to choose from as well as fresh juices, tea & coffee and even fruit smoothies!!
The bar was pleasant and although I didn't eat in here the food did look really good too! The staff were very nice and very helpful and all in all I really liked this hotel!
I was staying here as I was at a show at the RDS which is a 5 minute walk away and there are also several nice bars and restaurant surrounding it too!
Defo recommend this hotel!",5,2015,04,16
213,A good one,"Stayed here just for one night last weekend 
I found the hotel very clean and very central 
The room was very nice spacious clean and bright had a safe and trousers press 
But an clothes iron in the room would be very useful 
The bed was very big and comfortable 
While this was just a quick visit I did not avail of the facilities in the spa or gym 
The hotel was quiet at night the barman on the residents bar made one of the best mojitos I have ever tasted 
I will stay here again in the future 
Ideal hotel to stay in for a good night out in the local bars and restaurants 
10 out of 10 ",5,2015,04,15
213,No facilities in your room!,"I'm amazed this hotel has a 4 star average review. I booked for one night for a business trip. My room was tiny with a 4ft bed, no dressing table and more importantly no tea/coffee making facilities. To get a cup of tea of coffee you had to call room service and pay €3.50. It's the first time I have ever visited a hotel in the world and not had free tea and coffee provided. Breakfast was €15 for continental or €19 for Irish so I opted for continental. When I checked out I complained about the lack of tea/coffee facilities and was simply told that I ""wasn't the first to complain""! 

I am sure there are far nicer, roomier and more accommodating hotels to stay at in Dublin and therefore I don't recommend Herbert Park.",2,2015,04,12
213,Nice clean hotel in good location but the price of breakfast was offputting.,"We stayed in this hotel on Saturday April 4th as part of a family group. The hotel is vey well located, the rooms were spacious and clean however we were disappointed at the lack of tea/coffee making facilities in our rooms. The only other negative was the price being charged for breakfast i.e. €15.50 for a continental breakfast and €19.50 for a full breakfast which I would consider to be too expensive.",4,2015,04,12
213,Good location in Dublin 4,"Nice hotel located in a lovely part of Dublin within a 10 to 15 minute walk of the city. Some nice bars and restaurants in the nearby area and the nearby Herbert Park is a wonderful place to take a walk or run.

We stayed for one night and the rate was decent at €139 including breakfast and parking with a bottle of prosecco included.

Rooms are of a very high quality and the staff in check in were very good.

We went for a drink in the bar before we went out for dinner and when we returned and I have to say that on both occasions the staff were very poor and uninterested. I think it is badly missing a good Irish bar person to focus on customer service. 

Breakfast room is a lovely bright area over looking the park and the staff were very good and the food excellent with the omelette very good.  The one complaint would be that there were no complimentary papers to read while enjoying a leisurely breakfast.

",4,2015,04,10
213,Not a good nights sleep,"Stayed the Herbert Park on Tuesday night 7th April as I do each time I visit Dublin for pleasure and business purposes. Front of house staff as always a pleasure to deal with.
Room spotless and bed very comfortable. I did notice the room very warm when we arrived so I turned the aircon down to 21degrees. We left the hotel for the evening and returned at 11.30pm. Noticed the room was still very warm so I adjusted the temp down to 16 degrees. Even though the temp reading was at 16 degrees both my wife and I concluded that the room was in fact getting warmer. Woke at 2am/ 3am/ 4.30am and 6am because of the heat built up in the room. At that stage I turned off the air con and opened the window which did cool down the room a little. Upon check out I informed the reception of our problem and the answer I got was why didnt I contact housekeepiing. This was a very flimsy answer as ringing housekeeping at those hours is not very practical. Disappointed with how my complaint was dealt with.",3,2015,04,09
213,Modern nice hotel,"Nice clean and modern hotel, a little soulless but the rooms are large and up to date.  Cost to stay was very reasonable in comparison to some of the local hotels.  Overall a nice place to stay with a good breakfast.",4,2015,04,04
213,A great value deal- pricey otherwise,"We stayed at this hotel and got a great value deal. Dinner, bed and breakfast, free car parking and prosecco and canapes on arrival all for 109 pps. this was great value, food was good, rooms very spacious and the hotel location was great too. We had a very enjoyable stay, my only hiccup with this hotel was the prices for food and beverages the next day. 4.70 for a cup of tea is a tad over the top, however, I do appreciate that it is Ballsbridge location and a great hotel. Overall, a great spot made even better with a great value deal.",4,2015,04,03
213,Fabulous hotel,Compliments on all aspects of catering and services provided by this hotel.Prosecco and canapés on arrival was a fabulous touch. Rooms in excellent condition and restaurant food most delicious.Definitely be back.,5,2015,03,31
213,herbert park hotel-dublin  first class establishment,"27/3/15 -29/3/15
Have just been staying at the Herbert Park Hotel, Ballsbridge  Dublin.
We have been staying there now for years and it just can't be beaten.
From the minute you arrive the class shines through.
The attitude of the staff, quality of service and standard of rooms are excellent and never fail to impress.
Always recommend to family and friends alike. The best in Dublin in a beautiful location. Aviva on your doorstep. 
Will be back soon.

213,"Fantastic location, great staff","I stayed here with my 5 sisters-in-law Sat night, to celebrate a Big Birthday.  The staff were very helpful, reserved an area in the Foyer for us and had our Bubbly ready when the Birthday Girl arrived, as this was a surprise for her.  My request for a top sheet and blankets rather than a duvet was dealt with promptly.    Breakfast was the norm for a 4* Hotel, hot and cold buffet, lots of fresh tea and coffee delivered to the table.   The selection of fresh fruit was excellent.",4,2015,03,30
213,Very helpful staff,"I came at 11pm and needed to print 180 pages.  They were most helpful.  Next morning I needed to scan 30 pages and have them email it to me. Then I added another 8 pages later in the day.  They conducted everything I needed, including getting me on the phone with FEDEX who arrived just as I needed them.  I couldn't have asked for better service.",5,2015,03,30
213,Weekend with friends ,"Great service, helpful staff and lovely comfortable rooms. We had beautiful food for dinner and breakfast the next morning. We were late arriving but staff brought us canapés to the room as we had missed them. Prosecco on arrival a lovely treat. Would recommend. ",4,2015,03,29
213,There are better places,The hotel was fine. Breakfast dissapointing. Check in was a bit messy as we were given wrong keys and argue to get our complamentry bottle of wine. My morning newspaper didn't arrive and staff were unhelpful\uninterested when I complained. Never got my paper. Not the worst hotel in Dublin but there are many hotels much better.,2,2015,03,29
213,Weekend with friends,Had a brilliant weekend meeting friends. This hotel is excellent and the staff are so friendly and helpful even allowed us an extension on our free parking. Of course the complimentary bottle of Prosecco helped also as we went for the Fabulous package! Will definitely return!,5,2015,03,27
213,Excellent value,"stayed at this hotel on St. Patrick's night, got a fantastic deal, €129 for B&B. Received a great welcome at reception and then when we proceeded to the room we were greeted by a lovely view. Had drinks in the bar, a little pricy but atmosphere was nice. Hotel is very close to some beautiful restaurants. ",5,2015,03,26
213,Nice hotel.,"This is a nice hotel which is well situated for many events. Its close to the RDS, The Aviva Stadium and not too far from The Three Arena. Its also in a business district so it's a good hotel for business people. Rooms are very clean and comfortable and its surprisingly quiet for a city hotel. Definitely would stay here again. ",4,2015,03,25
213,Great service and location.,"I stayed here for 2 weeks for a work trip, and I was not disappointed at all. The staff were always friendly, the menu selection was great, and the location is excellent.

The rooms are well appointed, and serviced to the highest level. Offering 24 hour room service from a good menu.

Both the bar and restaurant offer excellent facilities, and me and my work colleagues were always treated with the greatest respect.

If you are staying in Dublin, consider this as one of your first choices, and you won't be disappointed.",5,2015,03,23
213,Very comfy,"They have nice big rooms that you can swing three cats in. Lovely deep bath with loads of hot water. The staff were always very helpful and it is nice and close to the Royal Dublin Society. 
Very comfortable after a long day of work. The bed was absolutely luxurious!
",4,2015,03,23
213,very relaxing,"My husband and I stayed here for 2 nights. We went for the Executive room on the 5th floor. this included breakfast and a bottle of Presecco each night. with this package it included tea and coffee on arrival, it also came with overnight parking which we did not need, however a plus point. Our room overlooked the side and we could see into the RDS.
the room was very comfortable and very quiet, the bathroom was a good size and a jacuzzi. We were visiting family and they joined us for a meal on our first night. The food was superb, the service excellent and in fact the whole week-end the service could not have been better. The staff in the dinging room and bar were extremely friendly and really made our stay.",5,2015,03,17
213,This is the only match day hotel to bother with.,"If your going up to Dublin to watch the rugby do not waste your time with either the Clyde Court or Ballsbridge hotel. These establishments are a poorly run joke. 

The Herbert Park hotel hosts a fantastic day on every match day with a professional team and salubrious surroundings. Great bar food and very nicely appointed rooms.",4,2015,03,09
213,Great Hotel in Dublin,"Have stayed here twice in the past 2 months - at the weekend.  The location is lovely, right beside a nice park which perfect for a morning stroll.  The rooms are in great condition, spotless.  The service is very friendly.  I would highly recommend it.",5,2015,03,08
213,Wonderfully clean and good service - very expensive,"We booked a room specifically to be near the Aviva stadium for the 6 Nations Rugby.
Friday night rate was €80 Saturday night rate was €200+ so they know how to hike up a price.
While the location of this hotel is great for the Aviva and RDS, that's about it. They charge you to park your car, €10 each night which is at the discounted rate for guests.
Pros: The rooms are very clean and comfortable. The staff are efficient and polite. Great location for the rugby. Fab blackout curtains.
Cons: Pricey for drinks and food. Breakfast is especially expensive. We ate out. 
The aircon is quite noisy. 
Only bathtowels are supplied per person. There was 1 hand towel. I have never stayed in a hotel with such few towels. Upon mentioning this at checkout, they said, sure just call us we can bring up more towels. Not great when I am already in the one towel! 
Constant water running noise which may have been due to our ensuite or the one next door.
Next time, I would stay in a more reasonably priced hotel.",3,2015,02,16
213,€59.50 for lunch per person!,"I have stayed at this hotel a number of times. Recently we stayed for a rugby match and had the buffet in the restaurant it was €30.00 each, bit steep but the food was good and there was plenty. Yesterday we stayed at the hotel again for a rugby match and decided to go for the buffett again. We didn't look at the menu board as we could see it was the same set up as before. We ate and went to sign the bill, the bill for two lunches only (no drinks) was €119.00. I was disgusted. The Herbert Park basically rips you off on occasion days and does not deserve to be supported!",1,2015,02,15
213,Perfect for Business !,"Excellent business hotel.
You can see that everything has been thought out for business travellers and the result is excellent.
WiFi, Breakfast, Comfy bed..All good.

The plus: Direct in the 4th district next to the RDS, so a great location to walk around and not far from the actual city centre (10 euros with a cab).

Excellent value as well.",5,2015,02,03
213,Always reliable hotel,"We have enjoyed several overnight stays in this hotel. Although we live in south county Dublin we find the location very convenient with easy access to city centre. Rooms are very comfortable, breakfast is superb and staff very professional and friendly. Only downside is restaurant is very poorly supported at night so would advise eating in one of the many local restaurants.",4,2015,02,01
213,I find that this hotel gets better every time,"This is my 5th yearly visit to this business hotel and I see many improvements over the years.
The location is perfect as it is in the vicinity of the convention centers and short walk into the center of the city. There are a number of excellent restaurants in the neighborhood.
The service is tops,  from Reception to housekeeping to the restaurant.
The food is good as well.
I will return in January of 2016 !",5,2015,02,01
213,Nice hotel,"Hotel is not in the center, but only 5 minutes further at the US embassy there is a bus stop which goes to the center, number 7,4 and 8. Rooms in the hotel are spacious and comfortable, the bathroom is quite small but very very clean, definitely a plus. Breakfast is very rich and it is not bad to pay with accommodation. The staff is friendly, they were willing to help but a lot of them are not originally Irish and they not know very well all the details of the city. Although a lot of them do not know, there's a bus card that you can buy for more driving. In the vicinity of the hotel (5min walk) there is a Mercedes dealership (ask at the reception direction) after the salon you'll see a small store, in the shop you can buy a bus ticket for 5 days.",4,2015,01,30
213,Lovely,"Stay here over the weekend.. Check in was great all the staff I had dealings with where lovely.... breakfast has a great selection, it was alway hot which isn't always the way for Buffet Breakfasts.

My room was Fantastic.  Very spacious, clean bright and great view of herbert park. Bed was very comfortable.

I look forward to my return visit. ",5,2015,01,29
213,Impressive!,"I really liked this hotel.  Large, modern rooms, a friendly staff and a nice location are all here.  It's a little far from the city center, but I found the walk very nice.  I ate in the lounge twice and really enjoyed the meals.  My only complaint is the price of a bottle of pop!  I think I paid 2.80 euros to get an 8 oz. bottle. There are some wonderful restaurants and cute pubs in the area.  I was very happy staying here, and I hope to come again!",4,2015,01,25
213,A really good hotel,"I have been visiting the Herbert   Park for many years and it never fails to impress . Great staff, good food ,comfortable bright rooms and a really nice atmosphere throughout the hotel.ThePPP special offers are great value. Looking forward to my next visit!",5,2015,01,25
213,Lovely,Stayed in this hotel last week we book using one of the offers they had on there website. It was a spur of the moment weekend away! Hotel very easy to find staff were so friendly and helpful. The room was spotless and very comfortable. We didnt have dinner here but we did have breakfast which had a vast choice available and service was very good. Secure parking is also a great bonus. All in all had a fantastic little getaway. Will definitely be returning again,4,2015,01,20
213,Too expensive,"The hotel is actually pretty good in a nice area, a bit far away from the city center ( 20-25 minutes walk).

I think i got the smallest room in the Hotel, i did not have even a desk. When being in business trip is a problem. I know from other colleagues staying in the hotel they got way bigger rooms with desk, with the same room rate or less. The room as clean and the bathroom was big enough.

Wi-fi is free and worked pretty good.

People working in the hotel were nice and everything was ok.

What makes it lose points for me:
- Tried to check out one day before, and they told me that i would be charged because it was out of the cancellation period. It is the first time that thing happens to me in hotels of this level.
- Everything is too expensive. 15€ for a breakfast seems expensive, but 4,50€ for a coffee at the terrace seems crazy even knowing that Dublin is an expensive city.
- The air conditioner was very noisy",3,2015,01,20
213,Rugby Weekend,Still fantastic. Wonderful Staff. We arrived a little late but were made to feel so welcome. The bar staff made sure we were comfortable and the eats before we went to the hotel were excellent. Of course our team won again and that always makes the stay so much more fun.,5,2015,01,06
213,great stay,Just home from a marvellous night in the Herbert park. Very relaxing atmosphere and wonderfully helpful staff. We stay here at least 5 times per year and have never been disappointed. Great for events in RDS. Lots of nearby eateries and pleasant walk into central Dublin for shopping.,5,2015,01,05
213,Friendly Modern Hotel next to RDS,"An excellent hotel next to the RDS. The DART station is also just a short walk away. The staff are friendly and helpful. Rooms are very clean with lovely decor. Breakfast was buffet style - only complaint is the standard of the bacon which was more fatty than meat, however, everything else was well cooked and more than adequate. 
Car parking was in a secure underground car park and very reasonable for guests at 10 Euro per night.",4,2015,01,05
213,new years eve break,1 of the best hotels ive stayed in from the moment we checked the room was lovely the staff were very helpful . will be booking another break at the hotel as i really enjoyed my stay could not fault it in anyway,5,2015,01,03
213,"Spent €150 on food, but still had to pay €7.50 for parking","For some unexplained reason, this hotel provides 2 hours complimentary parking if you eat in the restaurant, but not if you eat in the lounge. So you could spend say €40 in the restaurant and get complimentary parking, but spend €150 in the lounge on food for a group, as we did, and have to pay for parking, which comes across as a bit mean, not to mention inconsistent. That said, though we were there a bit over 3 hours, they only charged us for 3 hours.

That aside, the food and service was very good, though the food is quite expensive, e.g. €17.50 for a burger & fries (a lot of hotels seem to charge that bit extra as they have a somewhat captive clientele).",3,2015,01,03
213,Excellent and friendly,"I am staying in Herbert Parh Hotel for almost a year now and i am very satisfied with the service, how friendly and professional the staff is, the quality of the rooms, breakfast and meals (in general). The hotel is located next to the park, so a good opportunity to have a walk or go for jogging. It is not far from the town and surrounded by few good restaurants. A good destination during business trips and times with the family.",5,2014,12,23
213,Perfect location for dining out and shopping,Stayed in the Herbert park hotel 2nd week in Dec as we do every year as well as once during the year and have been doing this for a long time. The problem is we are never made feel that we are returning guests!! We have stayed all over dublin in other hotels but return here more frequently. The rooms are lovely the reception area particularly at christmas time is gorgeous but the lack of pleasantries lets this hotel down badly. Breakfast is just ok but the location of the hotel makes it perfect to dine out in great nearby restaurants. As well as this it is easy to walk to town in about 20 minutes. We probably will return but I would suggest that staff at reception should make an effort to welcome guests who have chosen their hotel to return to and be grateful for that???,4,2014,12,19
213,Very Central,"Stayed here for ease of access to RDS and Bord Gais Energy Theatre.  Don't usually stay in the city.  Clean, friendly and secure parking - a necessity when you are prepared to walk everywhere and don't want to have to worry about moving the car.  The only downside was that the breakfast was extremely expensive.  But easily rectified by going to Roly's Bistro around the corner instead (only place beside it that does breakfast on a Sunday morning).",4,2014,12,18
213,Potentially Best Hotel in Dublin,"After staying in many Hotels in and around Dublin, The Herbert Park is by far the best Hotel to explore Dublin or stay on Business. The staff and management could not do enough during the stay. The restaurant serves great food and the Bar now serves Scottish Caledonian 80/Ale.

Perfect for business and pleasure and you might be lucky enough to even see a few famous people in the lounge.",5,2014,12,18
213,Lovely Hotel,"Have stayed in the Herbert Park on about 4/5 occasions and have always enjoyed it. We normally use it when going to rugby matches in the Aviva and have nearly always manager to get one of their overnight indulgence breaks with free parking and bottle of prosecco.  Rooms are lovely, comfortable and spotlessly clean.  Staff very efficient and most of them friendly. Breakfast is very good, nice buffet selection and lovely freshly squeezed orange juice.  Location is perfect for the Aviva and a nice 15/20 min stroll will bring you into Stephen's green. Would definitely recommend hotel and would stay there again.  Terrace bar staff really nice and friendly, but it does lack atmosphere and drink prices on the high side.",4,2014,12,14
213,Comfortable stay in a great location,"I stayed at the Herbert Park Hotel for 4 nights as I was working in the RDS across the road.  Very comfortable, ideal location for business this side of the city.  The room was very comfortable and bedroom and bathroom were spotless.  I had a lovely view of Herbert Park.  A good breakfast to start the day, again with lovely views of the park. I had light bar food one evening which was brought swiftly, presented nicely and was very tasty.  The receptionists were welcoming and helpful.  
For the purpose of this business trip, the location was just perfect.  I would also come back again with my husband and family to stay.",5,2014,12,10
213,Very comfortable.,"I have no hesitation in recommending this contemporary very comfortable hotel which is in a very convenient location.
Restful rooms, very comfortable beds, nice food and delightful staff. If I had any criticism it would be that the bathrooms are somewhat compact.",4,2014,12,08
213,"Good location , simple breakfast ","It's a little bit old hotel but clean and comfortable.
Breakfast is good but charging for breakfast is a bit too much.
Lots of noise from air conditioner 
Wifi connection also a bit confusing but it works fine once you understand how it works. It is price worthy.
",3,2014,12,04
213,Would recommend,"I would totally recommend the Herbert Park for a stay in Dublin. The rooms are very comfortable breakfast super location great and excellent staff.The rates on line are very competitive. 
I left clothes behind and they did everything to return them to me.",5,2014,12,03
213,Super hotel,"Brilliant hotel; clean, neat rooms with v comfortable bed. We've stayed here twice and the first time, our room overlooked the park but the second time, the view wasn't so good! Although there are no tea/coffee-making facilities, room service will provided tea/coffee v quickly for a small charge.  I would definitely recommend the hotel for it's friendly staff & great rooms. ",5,2014,12,02
213,Brilliant !,"Only stayed one night in this hotel but it was lovely.
Very nice room with a good view. The bed was extremely comfortable. No problem sleeping.
We enjoyed the breakfast. Nice choice. and variety.
Service was good and the staff very pleasant and helpful.
Overall very good.",5,2014,12,01
213,My go to hotel in Dublin,"The only hotel that I ever stay in when I'm in Dublin. So welcoming. Nothing is too much trouble. Incredibly clean and comfortable. Fantastic location, waking distance of great restaurants and public transport. Can't wait to stay again soon!",5,2014,11,30
213,Far away from Airport/Centre - Bad Checkout Service,"I stayed in the Herbert Park Hotel for one night since I had business in Dublin the next day.

The taxi ride to the hotel was expensive since the hotel is in the south side of the city (30min in the taxi) and I am sure I was robbed since the taxi driver had the meter marking 27 euros...turned it off and then one again and it marked 38 euros and said it was the toll for the tunnel and the bags (versus 23,5 Euros that I paid the next day... rip off). So be careful with Taxis in Dublin.... some taxi drivers might not be very honest.

The hotel itself is a bit impersonal, very large and you just feel a bit lost but safe. You need to swipe your card to use the elevators which made me feel safer. The area is nice and is very close to pubs and restaurants where you can get food.

My only bad experience was related to the checkout where I was told the room was already paid for (which contradicted my reservation notes) and the checkout person refused to give me the receipt even when asked. I've now checked my credit card statement and obviously, it was charged. But I have no receipt to prove it.

Overall - not a bad experience but if you are in town for business this hotel is a bit far from most locations and far from the airport (Dublin traffic in the mornings/evenings to/from the airport is a nightmare)",4,2014,11,11
213,Fantastic hotel with excellent service,"We visited this hotel for a family occasion and were delighted with our choice. The Hotel is well located with lots of things around it and is within easy reach of the city centre by bus or taxi.

The rooms are very comfortable and cleaned to a very high standard. The most standout thing about the whole trip was the service provided by all the staff. From check in, in the bar and the restaurant the service was excellent and nothing was too much trouble. As it was our Wedding Anniversary we treated ourselves to a package with wine in the room and a meal in the restaurant and both were excellent. 

Overall I would recommend this hotel for business or leisure.",5,2014,11,10
213,Just Ok,"Stayed for business and remained for the weekend for pleasure.  The positives are that it is a modern hotel that is in great condition and the rooms are extremely well appointed.  The location is not ideal for accessing the center of Dublin so you end up with many 10 Euro taxi rides.  The service is not unpleasant but certainly not warm, welcoming, or helpful.  ",3,2014,11,08
213,First & Last stay -very disappointing!,"I stay on business in Dublin 25-30 nights per year and this was my first booking at the Herbert Park and how disappointing it was. 24 hours + before arrival I attempted to change my booking to a date later that week and was told it would cost the full cancellation -VERY inflexible particularly on a quiet week night -I have never come across this with any other Dublin hotels Ive stayed in.During my stay I found the staff unwelcoming, unfriendly and most unhelpful -I was presented with my bill both in the lounge bar and at breakfast before I had even eaten??  Found a large hair in my scrambled egg at breakfast -the waitress took it away and said I wouldnt be charged -At check out I was charged full price for breakfast with no apology whatsoever.  Bedrooms -well appointed but pillows hard and uncomfortable and a complicated log-in system for the WIFI.  Food OK, car park (hotels own underground) a complete rip-off even by Dublins standards (10 Euro). No atmosphere or warmth in this hotel, a large grey intimidating foyer/lounge bar. My least favourite place to stay in Dublin. Such a pity as the location and facilities are super and this hotel has so much more potential.",1,2014,11,03
213,"Nice, but on the edge of town","This hotel is on the edge of town. Our tour drove us where we needed to go. The shower/tubs are very high throughout Ireland. Be careful getting in and out. The floors, in the bathrooms, are all slick. The food in the restaurant is good.",4,2014,11,02
213,Nice hotel - Staff at reception could smile a little,"I stayed here recently for the second time on a part business, part leisure trip with family. Hotel looks lovely, if lacking warmth. I guess it is primarily a business hotel so this may be why it lacks atmosphere. 

Rooms are large and comfortable. I don't like that they charge €3.50 for tea/coffee in the room though...leaves a bit of a sour taste. We ate food in the lounge which was good. Breakfast however is much over-priced at over €15 pp for continental and over €19 for full Irish! The staff in the lounge were particularly lovely...very helpful and friendly. The guys at reception were however abrupt and a little cold eventhough they are efficient. A smile and a little warmth would go a long way! €10 for guests to park did not go down well and should be free in my opinion.

Being next to the lovely Herbert park is a big plus for family.",3,2014,10,31
213,Nice modern hotel,"I was on a business trip in the second half of october, and stayed here for 3 days. Nice large room, clean and  minimally decorated with a English flavour.I liked it and everything you need was in there (minus toothpaste/shaving kit/night dress: I am not sure if this is standard norm in Europe, but I was lucky at many palces).
If you stay with young children, the public park is next to the hotel and this is a big plus. I would certainly stay here again, when I come to Dublin. On the negative (very few): this is modern hotel and not very atmosphereic. Choice of food is limited to European; people from Asia may find this bit challenging. There is also a nice irish bar just outside the hotel for those who like ""irish bars"". i also noted an Indian restaurant named Ravi's Kitchen very clsoe to this hotel on the opposite side of the road",4,2014,10,30
213,Weekend package,"Stayed here for a weekend in October. Very nice hotel and staff were excellent, very courteous and helpful. We had a lovely room on the third floor. I was a little disappointed when I realised we did not have tea/coffee making facilities. There was a great selection of fruit and cereal for breakfast, however the rashers & sausages etc could have been hotter (they were actually hotter the third morning we were there).  We really enjoyed our stay and again I have to compliment the staff. Well done.",4,2014,10,30
213,Was okay?,"Booked the Hotel as I wanted to stay in a quiet area of Dublin; couldnt moan, got in very early so thank you! However, as you came off the elevator, there was a smell that you could only relate to being old; I understand that you have a lot of business people coming through the hotel, but it does make you want to walk in the other direction.
Going to the business people part; there maybe alot of people that come through your hotel that are business people, but instead of asking people for their credit cards to purchase items, please remember that not everyone believes in credit cards! Maybe ask, 'would you like to add breakfast onto your stay with us?'
Rooms were very comfortable, your Housekeeping Team does a very good job in keeping the rooms clean!",4,2014,10,29
213,Would expect more from 4 Star Hotel,"Booked a triple room (requested 3 single beds) our room had a double and a single and could not be changed. The room was large and comfortable it was located at the back of Hotel.  Our package included a bottle of  wine for both nights of our stay. but no bottle opener provided we had to ring reception when we wanted bottle opened.  The Hotel lacked attention to detail you would expect in a 4 star Hotel, no tea/coffee making facilities, you could order tea/coffee and biscuits for €3.60 for 1 or 2 people the tray was delivered with 1 cellophane wrapped biscuit per person.  There were 2 wine glasses and on the second day we were given 1 hand towel, there was no iron in the room.   We seemed to be always ringing reception for something.  Breakfast was good lots of fruit,  cereals etc. the hot food was ok, the Breakfast Staff were very attentive.",3,2014,10,28
213,My favourite Dublin hotel,"This great location is second only to the wonderful personal service I receive whenever I stay at  the Herbert Park.  I am always greeted with a warm smile and welcome.  Domatalia and Egle in particular, are always attentive and helpful, however each and every staff member helps to make my stay comfortable and enjoyable.  The amenities are excellent with top class wifi (a must for business).",5,2014,10,28
213,Functional but good be better,"Location is good when you are in Dublin for business and there are a few good options for breakfast/ dinner walking distance
Unfortunately, even though my room was clean, the carpet was aged and smelled so it was very annoying at night to sleep around such carpet. They should clean them properly or change them.
Service is ok : not particularly friendly, just neutral",3,2014,10,24
213,Above average with minor kinks,"I enjoyed my stay at the Herbert Park hotel, however had a few issues. On arrival, our rooms were not ready (waited for over an hour - there was a lady who had waited for over 3 hours!). 
They do not offer coffee in the rooms :-(
But apart from all this, the rooms are immaculate & the food is great. Restaurant staff are very friendly, while the guys in the front desk could do with a smile :-)",3,2014,10,21
213,Functional yet lacking friendliness and comfort,"Herbert Park Hotel

Check in was very much a lacklustre affair. Got the job done I guess, but did not leave me inspired to be there.

The room itself is clean but very basic. OK for business people, or monks who feel guilty if experiencing any pleasure whatsoever. Bed and pillows may suit people with back problems. 

Bathroom amenities are minimal and cheap (sorry!), but I did like the water temp and pressure. Also, shower curtains...

I ate dinner at the empty restaurant. Was informed that I could only sit in the restaurant if ordering from the restaurant menu. If I wanted the lounge menu, well, I had to sit on the adjacent table in the equally empty lounge. That's the process, so deal with it. Food quality (beef stir fry) was stodgy.

The location is near a few nice pubs and a couple of restaurants that are very local, and not many tourists. You can get a bus into the main city area fairly easily, so this makes the hotel a good option if you can't get one in the thick of the city area.

(I actually walked back from trinity/temple bar and took some great photos at the canal on my way)

Breakfast: Pretty good selection of continental fare. I liked the muesli offering but was not impressed with the boxes of supermarket cereal. No eggs or cooked stuff on the continental side. Plenty of fresh juice and a smoothie. Hotel breakfast is important, and this one did pretty well. Only drawback is that decent coffee is an extra charge. Espresso, like wifi should be universally free in hotels. 

Overall - I found this hotel functional but missing the friendly warmth and nice touches that other hotels can offer. 

**please don't forget to give me a helpful vote if you liked this review!",3,2014,10,21
213,LOCATION,"What is worth mentioning about this hotel, is its great location, next to Herbert Park. The room was OK, not spacious neither tiny and breakfast was more than satisfactory. However, I got a very bad impression when I asked for a power adaptor . They could only SELL one at the price of 17 euros, which was a rip off! Other than that, an ok hotel, nothing to remember about it.",4,2014,10,16
213,Don't book a single room !,"Looked forward to staying here as it looks great from the outside and is central to where I need to go for work. Very disappointed. Was given a tiny room. No space , no table, plug point on the opposite side of the room as the mirror- makes blow drying your hair challenging ! Air conditioning hummed all night. Ordered room service, the waiter offered to put it on my table- but wait- I don't even have a table !! Over priced for what it was. Plenty of good b&b s in the area that offer better facilities for a lot less. Unfortunately they were booked out on this occasion. Can't see myself staying here again.",2,2014,10,15
213,A Pain in the Neck (literally),"I have never encountered a 4-star hotel that used rectangles of hard foam and called them pillows.  I rang down requesting a feather pillow and was told that there were none.  When I asked why, I was told that some people may be allergic to them.  That struck me as a little lame, like when hotels become environmentally conscious when it means they don't have to wash your towels or sheets.
The other weird thing was that there were no clocks in the room.
Perhaps some people are allergic to those too.",3,2014,10,12
213,Herbert park,"We recently stayed for one night at this hotel.Great location with plenty of restaurants and pubs nearby,right beside the RDS  and near the Aviva stadium.Car park was €10 extra .Check in was quick and courteous,standard room with all the mod cons you would expect,the bed was extremely comfortable , that said wallpaper and some of the furniture could do with some updating.We would stay again and recommend to friends.",4,2014,10,11
213,dowdy and average,"I've stayed here quite often and never written a review.  I now realise it's because the place is so instantly forgettable!  It could be a shred office block, an airport waiting area or a closed hotel....there is no atmosphere at all!!
Rooms ok, good space, clean and comfortable BUT there is always electrical noise wherever you stay in the hotel.  An airconditioning unit hum or something.  In summer, it renders sleep near impossible.  It is worse at the back of the hotel, but even the front...is not good.",2,2014,10,10
213,Superb Hotel,"We stayed for three weeks in September as we had a parent in a nearby hospital. This is a superb hotel and our experience was positive from beginning to end. All the staff were always so helpful, friendly and professional. I particularly want to compliment Egle and the front office staff who facilitated us in extending our stay on many occasions. Bedrooms in the hotel were quiet and spotlessly clean with very comfortable beds. Breakfast in the bright and airy dining room was of the highest standard. Location is excellent overlooking the beautiful Herbert Park and the hotel is very safe and secure.",5,2014,10,07
213,Excellent,Stayed there for a night absolutely superb service the food was very good and the bedrooms are top class and the receptionist is extremely helpful with any problems you may have during the stay. Derfinately recommend staying here if looking for a good city hotel!!!!,5,2014,10,05
213,wonderful experience,Our family started  our CIE Taste of Ireland tour a day early to allow us more time to enjoy Dublin. Staying at the Herbert Park added much to the experience. Everyone went out of their way to accommodate us and were unbelievably pleasant and friendly. We will definitely recommend the Herbert Park to others and hope to return in the future.,5,2014,10,05
213,Great stay at the Herbert Park Hotel,"Stayed 2 nights here on a recent C.I.E. tour.  This is a beautiful, modern hotel with very efficient and friendly staff.  It is situated adjacent to Herbert Park which is an excellent place to take a relaxing walk.  Breakfasts were very good as was a late night snack in the lounge.",5,2014,10,02
213,Beauty is only skin deep...terrible service,"I stayed here for two nights on business. The hotel looks great and the rooms are fine. The service is atrocious. On the first night a waiter mixed up our drinks order, tried to say it was our fault, then spilt a glass of wine all over me. Next night, I was locked out of my room and refused entry until I paid for the breakfast bill of someone that I had been seen eating breakfast with that morning. He is a colleague of mine, but our bookings were made completely separately. They should have taken up the issue with my colleague rather than having the audacity to deny me entry to my prepaid room. If you want to impress a date, then show them this place but DO NOT stay here. Service in Dublin is generally top notch. People are usually very kind, down to earth and fun. This hotel is a rude, pretentious, money sucking, corporate sleeping factory. There are many hotels nearby with similar prices and facilities and much better service. Avoid.",1,2014,10,01
213,Good standard,"I stayed in this hotel for one night in September 2014.

The hotel is a good standard and the rooms are very clean.

My only complaint is that they charge an additional €5 for eggs benedict, even though the breakfast is supposed to be included! Its a very unusual position to adopt, given that an ommlette is free!",3,2014,09,27
213,My favourite Dublin hotel,"Where to start...friendly, helpful, professional staff, good food and spotless decor. Central + good taxi and bus connections. The Manageress, Egla, deserves particular mention for exceptional customer care.",5,2014,09,26
213,Great for business trips,"Was here for 2 weeks last year on business and had a very comfortable stay. Check-in was fast and easy breezy, room was spotless and breakfast was always lovely with a view of Herbert Park.

Would highly recommend for business trips!",5,2014,09,25
213,Gorgeous hotel..,"Stayed with my boyfriend last week..We loved it..hotel is gorgeous and spotlessly clean and staff were great, very polite and attentuve. Food was really lovely too. Few bars cafes etc just across the street, perfect for a quiet romantic trip away which is what we wanted.  Would defs stay again......",5,2014,09,13
213,Perfect Business Trip Venue,"Not the cheapest in town but you would need to pay considerably more elsewhere to enjoy similar facilities. Spotlessly clean, ample meeting space, very friendly staff everywhere.
Food is excellent and competitive by local restaurant standards. I cannot stay every trip but I wish I could....",4,2014,09,12
213,Excellent hotel,Stayed here for a weekend in September very nice hotel with friendly staff. Rooms are very spacious with everything you need. Only 10 minutes into the city centre and costing only 10 euro in a taxi. Had food in the bar on the night we got there which was lovely. We did not have breakfast as we could not justify paying 20 euro for breakfast however there is a gorgeous cafe around the corner called Rolys bistro which serves the best breakfast iv ever had the food is amazing! The only thing I would say is that our room was by the lift so we were woken up in the early hours of the morning with loud guests! However overall a very good hotel would defiantly stay there again.,4,2014,09,11
213,Excellent Hotel,"We stayed in Herbert Park Hotel last weekend while attending an event in RDS.   Great location.   Very comfortable bed, room spotlessly clean.  Breakfast was lovely, great choice.  Staff could not have been nicer, extremely helpful and very pleasant.  Would highly recommend.",5,2014,09,09
213,Very nice hotel 10 minutes from Downtown Dublin,"This use an unexpected gem! A beautiful, quiet, friendly, hotel with AC and good access to restaurants and activities in Dublin. About 25 minutes from the airport, and located on Herbert Park. The rooms were very nice, and the breakfast buffet awesome!",5,2014,09,09
213,Herbert Park Hotel,"We stayed at the Herbert Park and it was fantastic. The lobby is beautifully decorated and very inviting.. Our room was very clean , no noise with a beautiful view of a park out the window. Very close to pubs , shopping and the staff was great.",5,2014,09,09
213,Good Choice,"We stayed here for just one night while on a CIE tour. Our room was clean and adequately roomy, and the air conditioner worked great. The lobby felt a little ""stiff"" though - not very homelike and welcoming. We did not eat any meals at the hotel, so I can't comment on that. Overall, it was a decent place to sleep if the price is right.",4,2014,09,06
213,"Ideal location, Clean & Safe","I stayed here overnight due to its close proximity to the US Embassy. Food was tasty & service prompt. Lobby spacious, airy & modern. Rooms were basic and bathroom very dated. Nothing spectacular, more functional. Staff friendly. Convenient, would stay again based on location. ",3,2014,09,05
213,really nice hotel,"really nice hotel, breakfast is expensive at 20 euro a head, no coffee making facilities in the room, tea and coffee is €3.50.good location for Dublin city center, overnight parking is 10euro/

Rooms are well kept bright and clean",4,2014,09,03
213,Working hair dryer a luxury not provided,"We stayed here in mid August for two nights.  Hotel is very modern and spotlessly clean. It is about a 10-15 minute taxi ride to the City Center however we like the Ballsbridge location as it is very close to family. There is parking directly under the hotel which is very convenient, however the entrance to the parking lot is a little hard to find - directions regarding this on the hotel web site could save you some time and frustration.  The hotel lobby feels a bit like an office building lobby, very minimalist.  The bedroom was very modern and the bed comfortable.  The bathroom was well appointed however whenever someone took a shower in the bath-shower combo, no matter how you arranged the shower curtain the bathroom floor got flooded.  Our main issue with the hotel was the lack of a working hairdryer.  Such a small item to create such grief! I have long hair.  The first morning I tried to use the hairdryer.  It was located in a drawer (hardwired into the back of the drawer) and you had to (according to the directions in the hotel pamphlet with such things as where the gym was, restaurants etc) keep moving the dryer for it to work as well as keep your hand in contact with certain parts of the dryer. Yes, even the hotel felt you need an instruction manual on the hairdryer.  The only place I found the instructions in our room was in the general hotel information manual, certainly not with the hairdryer itself.  Anyway, even with all these beautiful instructions, our hairdryer would not work.  It would go for ten seconds and then cut out.  I would then shake it and move it about for another 15 seconds when it would start up again for another 10 seconds.  Being what I thought was a pretty reasonable person, I thought ""no big deal"". I called reception and told the gentleman there the situation and asked for a hairdryer to be delivered to the room.  The answer was a simple ""No.""  He refused to believe his wonderful piece of technology was not working.  Even if it had been working and perhaps I was elderly and had arthritis and could not operate his marvel of technology, he apparently had no hairdryer to deliver to the room.  Believe me, I asked.  My husband ended up getting dressed, leaving the hotel and going to a family member's home to borrow a hairdryer.  While I dried my hair, my husband went to breakfast in Rolly's Bistro, a 1 minute walk from the hotel.  He was just too angry with how we were treated to actually go to the hotel restaurant.  Rolly's does a fabulous full Irish breakfast at a very low price so I would really recommend it.  I missed breakfast the first day but the second day enjoyed my Rolly's breakfast.  I do not want to be unfair to the hotel.  It is clean and modern in a good location close to the City center.  It is also very inexpensive compared to the Four Seasons down the road where we normally stay.  We stayed at the Herbert Park this time for the first time as we thought we would literally be only sleeping there, it was closer to our families residences and it was not worth paying the Four Seasons Premium for a quick two night stay.  Had it not been for the hairdryer situation (which even if theirs had worked would have been horrible to use) I would probably be writing a review saying it was clean, in a good location but impersonal.  I think the hotel needs to focus a lot more on how ""little"" things like a hairdryer totally mess up their guests schedules and feeling of comfort.",3,2014,09,02
213,dissappointed,expected this hotel to be nicer & more luxurious. food was expensive(breakfast was €19pp plus an extra €6.50pp to have it delivered to the room). the atmosphere in the hotel  was very cold & impersonal. the location was great it was very central to everything & the park was lovely for a stroll.,2,2014,09,02
213,Amazing impression of Dublin,"My partner booked this hotel for us for 2 nights as a Birthday surprise. Beautiful hotel, great location. Staff were very welcoming and helpful. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay and I would definitely recommend this hotel. One thing I would recommend to anyone travelling into the city centre via taxi from the hotel is to avoid rush hour, a 5/10 minute drive took us over 35 minutes with the meter ticking but that's just a tip.",5,2014,08,31
213,Bedroom let it down,Stayed at this hotel recently. The reception area and bar are very well decorated and all the staff were more than pleasant. Have to admit I was disappointed with the size of the bedroom which was located on the fifth floor at the back of the hotel and was obviously overdue for redecorating. The fan in the bathroom wasn't working either. Overall a fine hotel in a very convenient location which was very well maintained and decorated in the public areas but the bedroom let it down. Didn't have breakfast in the hotel so can't comment on it.,3,2014,08,31
213,"Wonderful hotel, a gem!","A beautiful hotel in a great location! We stayed for two nights, the room was spotlessly clean, spacious and bright with a lovely view of the park and a glimpse of the Dublin mountains. It got extremely warm at night despite the air conditioning but other than that was very comfortable.The bar is lovely and relaxing with great food at a reasonable price. All the staff were extremely friendly and helpful, particularly at reception. It looses a point because of difficulty with booking the rooms. We had to make two separate online bookings for the two days to accommodate the planned arrival of other members of our party on the second day of our stay as several attempts to make the reservation by phone failed and for the €10 a night parking fee. Overall though it was great value and a fantastic stay!",4,2014,08,29
213,"Nice hotel, great location","Stayed here for one night, for an outing to the theatre. It always seemed out of the price range of most average hotels in the area. But at 115 Euro it could not be passed. This is a very good hotel,  rooms are really nice. Great furnishings and very quiet. Lovely views over Ballsbridge and Herbert Park.

Check in was hassle free, with friendly staff. There's an underground car park, for 10 Euro per night.

There is not kettle in the room, you can order tea or coffee for two for 3.50. There's a mini bar aswell with to be expected sky high prices.

If we got the hotel at this price we'd stay again. The bar and restaurant area was very quiet, late Friday evening and only around five people there. It seems deserted, which might explain the good value.

Despite that this is a very good hotel, with great staff and a real feeling of comfort.",4,2014,08,28
213,Great Value and Great location,"We had another over night in Dublin last week and stayed at the Herbert Park. A king size double bed in a large well appointed room for 135 euros INCLUDING a comp bottle of Preseco ( usually 35 euros) full Irish breakfast and the free overnight parking (usually about 10 euros)

Great value and a good service. The modern contemporary design is a little cold but overall an excellent property set in the beautiful Herbert Park.  Always make sure you book on a package which is great value to include the parking and breakfast!!",4,2014,08,28
213,Keep coming back,"This was my third stay and once again it was great. The hotel staff were friendly and efficient. We asked for extra bedding for a cot and it arrived within 5 mins. Rooms, as always were clean and spacious. We had a package this time which included free parking. This is the only down side to the hotel ie you have to pay for overnight parking.  The location is very handy. The bus takes you into town in 10 mins. The park next door is great, especially when the weather is good. Breakfast had a great variety of hot and cold food.  A great hotel as always.",5,2014,08,26
213,NOT FOR FAMILIES!!,"I had a bad experience from this hotel before I even stayed there. We have two children, (2+4) and I booked a triple room and a roll out bed for my 2 year old. The hotel wanted €30 extra per night for the roll out. I have stayed in many hotels and have NEVER paid extra for a roll out bed. They then suggested that they would give me a interconnecting room at a extra cost of €130 per night! I just booked the triple online and no extra bed and we would sorted something out. Arrived and they had give me a Double room with a roll out bed and called it a triple! Not going to bore you with the details but we got no satisfaction from the desk or from the manager. Our room was €145 per night. No breakfast. You have to pay €10 per night for parking. There is NO tea or coffee in your room. We had a family reunion for the two days and I had rand the evening before to TRY and book a table for food and drinks for 10 adults and 5 children. They receptionist said that she'd check and ring back. They didn't ring until after linch the following day by which time we booked else where. Very disappointed with the whole experience. We always stay in a different hotel in Dublin and looks like we will be heading back the next visit where families ARE welcome and you don't have to pay for every little option. Also found out that my Brother in law paid €90 for same room without roll out. Won't be back.",3,2014,08,25
213,Keep us coming back,"This was my 4th stay at the Herbert Park & I just love it. Perfect location close to dundrum and city centre for shopping. Ive stopped checking other hotels rates as Herbert park has everything. Great parking, clean spacious well appointed rooms with wifi. Its luxury at affordable prices. The park next door is such a wonderful facility and parkview rooms are so lovely. Special mention to Saddam & Sunita who looked after us very well and were so kind to our children and Egle who looked after us at checkout and helped us book our next trip. ",5,2014,08,24
213,great spot but missed the kettle!,"This was the perfect hotel for a reunion with college girlfriends - great location, comfy rooms, beautiful foyer, pleasant staff. All we missed was the kettle for the early morning cuppa...
(Foyer bar coffee was really good quality and delicious, something it is getting harder to find).",4,2014,08,22
213,New favourite place to stay in Dublin!,"Superb location, wonderful breakfast, great Saturday packages including free parking and a bottle of Prosecco, friendly staff especially Egle, lovely atmosphere, iphone charger in room, all in all clean and comfortable. Only one teeny weeny niggle, no tea and coffee facility in room.",5,2014,08,21
213,Very poor lunch,"Had lunch here recently and it was really poor.  I had the ""Herbert Park Special"" which is described as half a sandwich, bowl of soup and a side salad. 

When it arrived, I had to check if I was in fact in a pub in rural Ireland in 1975.  The half sandwich was two thick slices of white bread, from one of those Toast sliced pans,  There was a small amount of tuna mayonnaise.  The bread was actually dry on the outside.  

The soup was luke warm and completely over-salted and the side salad was fine.  My daughter had a bowl of chips and couldn't eat them for the amount of salt.  She tried to rub off the salt with her serviette but it was a futile exercise.

Our waitress did not seem happy in her job, scowling where smiling might have been more appropriate!  I did tell her that I wasn't happy with the food and I emailed the hotel afterwards and the reply was obviously the standard cut and paste reply that is sent to all customers who provide feedback.

A pot of tea is a staggering €4.70 in the Herbert Park Hotel,  If they're pitching themselves in that price range, they need to seriously address the quality of their food offering.",1,2014,08,21
213,RDS experience every year,We stay for the 5 days of the horse show each year and find the hotel very convenient for this purpose.  We have stayed 7 years running now and find the staff very accommodating.  When they are really busy you can be waiting for food a little more than regularly but you nearly expect that when so many people are around.  We normally allow for extra time but also know if we are in a hurry we won't eat in the hotel!  I find the hotel very relaxing and we have never had a bad experience there.,4,2014,08,19
213,Great Practical Hotel,"I have been staying at this hotel for many years now and find it's overall service to be excellent. The front staff recognise me on arrival and are always very courteous. The parking is adequate and meets my needs. The location of the hotel is perfect from a business perspective and avoids the rip-off costs of the main central Dublin hotels.
I especially like the quality of the breakfast. Don't change that. It is a great feature of the hotel.",4,2014,08,19
213,Very Good,"Stayed here on 3 days business recently with my partner. The hotel was in a perfect location for us for work. The first thing I noticed was how clean the place is kept from the lobby right through to the bedrooms.
We had a few drinks in the bar on 2 nights and there was a nice atmosphere with friendly staff. A particular mention for Fabio who managed to organise us some very tasty sandwiches around midnight one night as we had a late night working. Very happy!
Our bedroom was very clean and a decent size. It was lovely to come back in the evening to it as tidy as the day we checked in!
My only complaint was being woken on the 3rd morning by hammering before 9am. We had requested a quiet room as we needed rest after the long days work. We mentioned it on check out and the lady was very apologetic. Otherwise we were very happy.",4,2014,08,18
213,Overcharged and Refused to refund!!Stay away from them!!,"The day we checked out of the Herbert Park there was no power. There were no lights, the car park was in darkness and none of the lifts were working. When we went to check out I was told they would process the payment and forward me on the receipt, however I had wanted to pay the full amount in cash. The receptionist and I added the bill on a good old fashioned calculator and I paid her in full....there was no discussion of an outstanding balance, as we had included the room, the meal, car parking and the late checkout fee  I also know I paid in full as she gave me my change .

I was shocked therefore when I checked my credit card statement a couple of days later to see I had been charged an additional 50euros. It is my own stupidity that I didn't ask for a written note confirming the cash payment, however I was confident the issue would be resolved. Instead the hotel has been completely unhelpful, the front desk manager told me because their floats were balanced it was not their fault, when I suggested someone had pocketed it and charged my credit card she insisted they trust their staff. However I find it a HUGE coincidence that when the next day I asked to speak to the girl that had taken my money I was told she no longer worked there. The previous day had been her last day!!! 

The Operations manager just talked over me when I tried to explain and when I asked her to let me finish she hung up on me. The general manager has refused to take my calls, not answered any of my messages or acknowledged my emails.

I am 100% certain I paid the balance in full so I know without any doubt that the hotel has stolen 50 euros from me. Not only that but the way they've handled the whole situation and their complete lack of respect for their customers is reason enough that I'd say don't touch this hotel with a barge pole.",1,2014,08,17
213,excellent city hotel in up market area,"Herbert park offered us a great nights sleep uninterrupted by taxi or bus noise usually associated with city hotels.Room and bathroom very modern and seemed to have been recently redecorated.Full marks also for the very  comfortable bed.
Another plus point in my book is the ability to open the window providing nice ventilation which was no problem as we were 100m from any road with traffic.
City centre is a 20 min walk but plentyful taxi around €10 and buses every 20 min for less money
.Hotel rate was very reasonable and you can give the hotel breakfast a miss and have breakfast at Roly's (80m) which we consider a real Dublin experience with wonderful breakfast menu - we wouldn't go anywhere else !",4,2014,08,13
213,great hotel,"Just home from our annual stay at the Herbert Park Hotel for the Royal Dublin Horse Show, and once again we wernt disappointed. The staff are realky helpfull and friendly and go above what you would expect, a friend was left with no room and was exhausted the amazing duty manageress (I dont think she sleeps, shes always there!) Put an extra bed into our room for her to stay (obviously she had to pay a small surcharge, which was absolutely fine) but they really didnt need to go to the troubke they did ,amazing customer service.
housekeeping 5 out of 5, breakfast 5 out of 5m, location couldn't have been ang nearer for us.
needless to say I have akready booked for next year!,
if your looking for a hotel in Balsbridge look no further.",5,2014,08,12
213,good  fresh friendly,Good value friendly staff very nice comfortable room  food freshly cooked with good service I will return hear and it is very close to the RDS for all it events the area is very nice with a very well kept park  on site,4,2014,08,10
213,Excellent hotel away from the city centre,"Wonderful room with A/C and USB ports, friendly staff, quiet neighborhood and next to Herbert Park for evening walks, but just a 20 minute walk to St. Stephen's Green.  A great value for the quality of this hotel.  You'll pay much more staying in the city centre, and the quality will not be anywhere near the quality at the Herbert Park.",5,2014,08,09
213,A great hotel with good transport into the centre of Dublin,"We stayed at the hotel for a combination of business and pleasure. The staff were friendly and helpful. We had a very nice room with a nice outlook.

The bar and restaurant was very good and the breakfast service first rate.

Only one failure was the there were no tea/coffee making facilities in the room. Room service available 24 hours provided teas and coffees but I like to be able to make a cup in the room.

Very convenient for public transport into the centre of Dublin and the Air Coach from the airport stops 20 yards away.",5,2014,08,06
213,One night stay is very good,We stayed overnight here as we couldn't get any other reasonably priced hotel in Dublin on this night. It was a good location in Ballsbridge with the Dart railway just 5 mins walk from hotel. Very easy to access from city centre and approx €10 using a taxi. the room was nice and spacious. We had no breakfast included so cannot comment on the food. Room was 115 for the night.,4,2014,08,05
213,Close  and convenient to everything,Stayed here with the kids while in Dublin. Rooms were very clean and lobby was immaculate. It's in Dublin but not in the hustle and bustle of the city. Breakfast was great and had a large variety. We checked out early because we had to get to the airport. The car picked us up at 7. They had coffee and breakfast waiting for us. The staff very friendly and accommodating. They went out of their way to please their guests. Would stay there again.,5,2014,07,29
213,Great hotel in a beautiful part of Dublin!,"We wanted to bring our children to Dublin for a couple of days, so I started to check out hotels that my husband and I would often stay at.  Unfortunately many of these hotels could not accommodate our family, as we required a room with facilities to cater for my husband and I and 3 small children.  I came across the Herbert Park hotel on trip-advisor and saw that they offered a family package that provided 2 interconnecting rooms at a very reasonable rate.  However, there are many mixed reviews about this hotel and I was sure if I had made the right choice! However after staying two nights I can definitely say I will be back!! The hotel was immaculately clean, and it found the staff to be very helpful.  Ballsbridge itself is beautiful with Herbert park on your doorstep it made for a really enjoyable stay.  We travelled into the city by taxi which cost around 10 euro walking time to St Stephens Green is about 15 mins.  We will definitely stay here again.",5,2014,07,28
213,A very well appointed modern hotel with many facilities in a quiet part of dublin,"Set in a quiet park of Dublin and next to Herbert Park is an excellent hotel for business or pleasure. It is a modern hotel will the usual facilities of a 4/5 star hotel. The staff are helpful and friendly. The rooms a very good and all have free wifi . There is a formal restaurant and a good bar selection of foods(that are more substantial than many but also with good range of salads. The wine list is short but fairly priced and they also do ""high teas"". The breakfast spr4ead is very wide and includes food fruit/cheeses and cold meats up to a full Irish cooked breakfast.
They are also able to order UK papers to arrive when you wake up- not always the case in Dublin.t. 
The town centre is c10 minutes by cab or c35 minutes on foot.
If you are flying in a cab (ask for via the tunnel) takes about 15-30 mins depending upon traffic and costs around 25 euros. There are also buses.
There are several restaurants within 5 minutes walk with a good range from up market to cheaper.",4,2014,07,25
213,"Clean, close, comfortable and great breakfast.","The Herbert Park Hotel was the first place I stayed on my visit to Ireland.  It is across from the American Embassy, so the hotel is accustomed to executive travel.  It is clean, beautifully decorated, the rooms are modernly accommodating and comfortable.  The service was lovely and the breakfast buffet was my favorite of the trip.  It is close to everywhere you want to visit in Dublin.  I highly recommend this location.",5,2014,07,24
213,Fabulous hotel,"This hotel is very well located in a beautiful part of Dublin.
The breakfast is fantastic next to a garden and the service of all of the staff is excellent;
especially the help we received at the front desk.  It is a new
hotel with beautiful sorroundings.  The rooms are airconditioned which was a plus.",4,2014,07,22
213,Great first impression of Ireland.,Spent my birthday at the Herbert Park hotel.  It was our first hotel stay on our journey through Ireland and it gave us a great first impression.  The staff were very accommodating and took care of all of us coming in from several tour buses.  It was in a great location and he base.,5,2014,07,18
213,"Very nice hotel, very convenient location","I stayed here on business twice in the last month and it is a very nice hotel and ideally located for the business I was doing. The rooms are clean, bright and modern and are well equipped. The complementary wifi is very fast. The staff are friendly and efficient and I would definitely stay here again. The one complaint I have is the price of the breakfast when you are on a room-only rate. €15.50 for 2 weetabix, some fruit and a coffee. Not sure what it would have cost if I had been interested in some bacon and eggs!",4,2014,07,16
213,Very good in-room experience,"The rooms are excellent. A large and comfortable king-size bed with heavyweight cotton linen. Powerful air conditioning. A good selection of TV channels. USB charging ports on the desk. Fast and free wifi. A nice bathroom with a good choice of toiletries and a powerful shower. 

Both my daughters used the bar, which was reasonably priced, and one had lunch which she said was excellent. In my opinion €20 is a lot for breakfast so we went to the excellent Roly's bakery and bistro just around the corner. 

There is underground parking, which is reasonably priced at €10/night. 

Location is good - reasonably close to the city (€12 taxi) but with a selection of bars and places to eat in the immediate vicinity or within walking distance.",4,2014,07,15
213,Old Friend,"The Herbert Park Hotel, Ballsbridge, Dublin is a Hotel I have been going to for years both as a business Hotel and as a destination Hotel. Most people who travel to Dublin do so looking for the hustle and bustle of Dublin City Centre but the Ballsbridge area offers a sanctuary of peace and quiet but close enough to the City Centre to be easy to get to if that's your thing. Sitting adjacent to the oasis of Herbert Park, the Hotel is a genuine 4 star hotel whose staff leave no stone unturned in their quest to make your stay as pleasurable and effortless as possible.
Within thirty seconds of leaving the door of the hotel, you have a choice of good restaurants, ranging from Chinese to French and Italian to the excellent Roly's Bistro and some excellent genuine pubs.
What more do you require to have a good weekend break but a great hotel and good nightlife for couples.
Sorry my break ended today but will look forward returning later this year for another escape.",4,2014,07,13
213,Faultless service in a top class hotel!,"My two daughters and I has the pleasure of staying in the Herbert Park Hotel last week and could not find one negative aspect of our holiday. We were warmly greeted at reception by a very pleasant manager and this set the tone for our entire stay. Our bedroom was so comfortable and although there was an extra bed set up for us, there was no extra charge for this which was most impressive. We did not have dinner in the hotel as we had planned to meet up with friends in another Ballsbridge restaurant. We did however order 3 continental breakfasts in bed. Although we couldn't manage to finish everything, we were told that we were only being charged for 2 people as we had ordered very little! On the contrary, there was enough for 4 on our trays! Delicious hot chocolate, perfectly brewed tea, fruit salad, fresh orange juice, yoghurt, muesli, scrumptious croissants, pain au chocolates, Danishes, the list goes on.... And this was continental! So glad we didn't go for the works as we had to go back to bed for a snooze afterwards! And the lovely lady who brought the trays to our room kindly offered to supply fresh tea and toast if we needed it. I honestly could not fault this hotel, from the friendly, helpful service to the amazing value for money. We will definitely be back. Thank you to all the staff for making us feel so welcome.",5,2014,07,13
213,Very good hotel,We stay here approx 3-4 times per year... Just back from couple of days stay.. As good as ever.. Excellent service.. Staff very helpful especially reception staff..would recommend fully...very safe area of Dublin and near lively park and places to eat and drink...,5,2014,07,12
213,"Lovely, quiet setting","I stayed at this hotel while participating at an event at the RDS facility. The hotel is modern in style and the staff were friendly and helpful. I stayed with another woman and we had requested 2 single beds. The beds were pushed together, but I was able to pull them apart. The room was adequate in size and the bathroom was small, but adequate. As other reviewers have said, there is no coffee service in the room. The breakfast buffet was wonderful and the dining room large and very pleasant. We only had one dinner at the hotel because eating off small low tables in the lobby was not comfortable for me.",4,2014,07,08
213,What no restaurant!,"We stayed four nights at this hotel June 2014 mainly to attend an event at the RDS which is just around the corner. This is a modern hotel in the middle of a small complex of office/apartment buildings. On our first evening we went to the restaurant only to find it closed. The bar area was crammed with people mostly eating meals at low tables. There were a couple of staff running (literally) around the tables taking orders. When we eventually gained the attention of a waitress we asked her why the restaurant was closed. She replied that it is always closed in the evening as guests prefer to eat in the bar.  We had the misfortune to find seats close to an abandoned plate of uneaten salmon steak which gave off a strong fishy aroma.  After suffering the smell for half an hour we had to ask a waiter to clear the plate.   The lack of tea/coffee making in the room is a nuisance though room service  is quick and efficient. The buffet breakfast was overall good but on some mornings the bacon was very fatty and sometimes we had to wait for a table to become available.We asked if it would be possible to have a late check out as our flight was not until Sunday evening but we were told that the hotel was full and so it wasn't possible.Room was large, clean and comfortable, though the view was of the parking area. Overall o.k. but we thought expensive considering limited facilities.",3,2014,07,03
213,Good overall,"The Herbert Park is well situated, close to the US embassy, RDS and Dublin's CBD. For those travelling here on business the location is excellent for those requiring short transit times to business located on the Southside of Dublin. The IFSC is a short taxi ride. The staff are friendly, helpful. Despite being centrally located, it is not directly situated on a main thoroughfare, so in terms of sleep, there was not ambient noise whatsoever.

WiFi access is included in the rate and is fast, reliable, easily supporting streaming services such as iTunes and Netflix without problems.

Breakfast options are competitively priced and the continental option provides a good array of choices.

The gym on site is small, offering cardio options such as treadmill, elliptical, rowing and stationary bike. There are no free weights, though there is a cabled unit with pullup bar.",4,2014,06,26
213,Francisco,"I have stayed at Herbert Park Hotel between 13th and 23rd June 2014 in Pembroke Suite, 516.

The service is superb, the staff, especially at the reception, is amazingly very helpful, kind, friendly and efficient, food is very good and inexpensive.  

2 issues that let me down, there was no tea and coffee facilities in the bedroom as room service is not opened all night and although Hotel states tea and coffee is free 3.50 euros extra have to be paid for room service. Also the air conditioning in the bedroom by the window was not working, complaints were maid but the maintenance staff never managed to repair it during our 10 day stay.

If it wasn't for those two issues I would have rated it as EXCELLENT however this does not mean I'm not coming back.",4,2014,06,25
213,Food v good,Family dinner here- really very nice food- the soup was piping and delicious- lovely bread. Had a main course salad- tasty. The only let down was a fruit salad that was mainly apple and overpriced at €8.50. Good coffee. Service v good- all details perfect!,4,2014,06,14
213,Very Pleasant ,"It's been a couple of years since I stayed here.  Standards certainly have been maintained.  Very comfortable rooms and bathrooms.  Staff are very efficient and pleasant.  Wish they had tea/coffee facility in the room. I need my coffee when I wake up! Had queried this before?  In conclusion, a very fine hotel. But I really don't like the open plan lobby/ bar which makes me feel uncomfortable as a woman on my own. So it has to be room service. For that reason & no coffee facility not inclined to revisit. 
",4,2014,06,13
213,Quiet and convenient!,"Pleasant setting on the edge of a Victorian park; this modern hotel offers most things for the discerning guest. The only exception being lack of spa faciliies and a 'no tea and coffee' policy in the rooms! Good breakfast, spacious modern room, small gym in the basement. It was expensive at €165 per night b&b.",4,2014,06,04
213,Great for an event in the RDS,"A lovely lobby and lounge area. The receptionist was not the friendliest nor the most helpful when we asked where we could park. From sat nav directions, we had arrived at the front of the hotel and wondered how to get round to the side for parking. Parking is chargeable by the way. The rooms were spacious and clean. No tea/coffee making facilities; again chargeable if wanting some delivered to you room. Breakfast was not included either, so pricey for the room only. Very convenient if going to an event in the RDS and a quaint park beside the hotel.",4,2014,06,03
213,Reasonable for Dublin,"This is a nice hotel. Reasonably priced. Nice, spacious rooms, air conditioned. Lovely bar area and staff are friendly. Parking is extra but not too dear. Wifi is free. Easy to get into city centre by foot from here, about 20mins, but loads of fab restaurants and nice bars in the immediate vicinity.",4,2014,06,02
213,a pretty reliable place to stay,"Herbert Park is convenient for RDS - and thus for Leinster Rugby - a modern hotel, it rooms all seem to be equally pleasant and well-appointed. the staff are friendly and supportive - and the food fine.

There are local cafes and restaurants - it is on the airport coah route and there are frequent buses if you use them. the public areas are spacious and comfortable - the bar is welcoming (it is Dublin after all!).

the Balls Bridge is nearby - bu that hotel is closer to landowne Road- and more likely to be a venue for rugby crowds - somehow icould neot imagine Hebert Park being taken over as a fanzone in the saem way.

a good, relaxing vissit - save for ther rugby Leinster are awkward at home!",4,2014,06,01
213,No coffee or tea in the room ???What???,"Gorgeous, spotless hotel.  Very modern, too modern, actually. But after a long day of touring, upon check-in, we couldn't wait to get a cup of hot tea and relax before dinner. When I didn't see tea service in the room, I went to the front desk to ask if it was provided in the lobby somewhere. Oh yes, right down the hall, I was told. A friendly chap came towards me and asked if he could help.  Yes, please, where is the tea service ?  Well, I can get that for you right away, it is 7 euros a cup !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! We were on a tour for the past 9 days and this was the very first hotel that offered no tea, coffee or water in the room. Nothing. No one was happy about this.
I missed all the other hotels that were more weary- traveler friendly and cozy.",3,2014,05,30
213,Poor value for money,"Stayed here for five days with my wife and two small children in May, we have been using this hotel for family reunions for years but no more. The price of the rooms would put this hotel for me in the strong 4/5 star category but it's really only a three star. I found the following to be strongly negative points for the hotel. 1) the parking - they charge 10 euros a day, even though over the weekend the whole area is free for parking, also with a baby and a four year old, it's not really feasible to park away from the hotel. Also if your a tourist/out of town chances are you are using a car and need a car as the hotel is out of town a bit. 2) I asked for help on arrival and departure with the bags - none came. 3)The bedroom size was ok, although the layout was for a disabled person. 4)The bed mattress was terrible it was rock hard and seemed to a cheap one and also the pillows were cheap. For me you can tell a lot from the  mattress and pillows in a four star/plus hotel, after two days I had pains in my back and neck. 5)There was no coffee/tea facilities in the room but you could order for three euro fifty cent coffee or tea from room service. This is fair enough but when I ordered it the tea turned out to be weak and the coffee was poor. 6)In the lounge area, the hotel is charging nearly 10 euros for two cups of tea! This hotel is not downtown Dublin or in my opinion has a right to be ripping people off to this level, these prices rival top locations in New York or Paris !
7) The 20 euro charge for breakfast is high also and we avoided using it.
8) I asked for a late check out , they said they would charge me 25 euros for 2pm or 50 euros for 4 pm, first time I have heard this.
Staff are generally friendly and helpful and a plus point for the hotel and outside of the bags point above they  can't be held responsible for the actions/policies of management. It seems it's being run to save money where ever possible and squeeze the customer for every euro/dollar. Won't be coming back!",2,2014,05,29
213,A quite place in the city,"The hotel is located adjacent to Herbert Park which offers numerous advantages. First, the breakfast room overlooks the park and is a wonderful way to start the day looking out over the quiet green lawns in Dublin. Second, the park is quite large (32 acres) and thus a wonderful facility for walks right on the doorstep. Finally, the hotel is set back from the main road so is quiet. Although the hotel is not central it is sufficiently close to the city centre to offer guests a quiet refuge. Staff were very pleasant and helpful and the rooms well decorated and appointed. The marks for location reflect the fact is was within walking distance of my client's offices and adjacent to the park. For those seeking a city break it would be a three or four",4,2014,05,28
213,Decent for a business trip,"This hotel is decent for business but I wouldn't stay if you're a traveller/tourist.  Rooms were adequate, nothing special. Staff - some were friendly, others not so much.  I was using one of the computers in the lobby and asked for help, and the response was quite curt and terse. We needed a charger for our cell phone and they wanted to charge us 14 Euro for one - considering it was likely one left behind, I don't think so.  We bought an adaptor on Grafton Street for 4 Euro instead.  Breakfast was excellent but they didn't advertise that it was included, which was a let-down.",4,2014,05,28
213,Top spot,"We Stayed here a few weeks ago, this is a good Hotel it's so clean and modern,and it's in a great location, Ballsbridge is a lovely area of Dublin,there's a few pubs and many good restaurants nearby, although we eat in the Terrace lounge and it was really delicious and the staff were great.  Bus stop nearby if you need to go into Dublin or to walk it takes about 30 mins. Easy enough to get to 02 Arena if you ask taxi driver to drop you at Ringsend then just walk over bridge to O2 is the quickest and best way.  Breakfast is nice plenty of choice. I have stayed in this Hotel quite a few times and I've never been disappointed.",5,2014,05,25
213,An excellent place to stay in Dublin,I stayed at this Hotel for 3 weeks during a business trip to Dublin. The location of the hotel is ideal as its walking distance from great restaurants and the Herbert Park provides an ideal place to relax and unwind.The food was good and the staff were warm and welcoming.,4,2014,05,25
213,A 3 star Hotel pretending to be a 4 star.,"My experience here was not good. On arriving at check in the Receptionist took four telephone calls while checking me in. Personal service is not their thing. I felt like I was an inconvenience! The room was very nice and very clean but lacked simple things like tea making facilities. They charge €3.50 for a cup of tea and for one who drinks a lot of tea it works out expensive and the quality of the €3.50 tea is very poor! You'll need to be very savvy to work the TV! The internet log in process is tedious and complicated. And breakfast? Well, Mayhem is the best word I can use. You get ""greeted"" by a gruff woman who tells you to ""sit over there!"" and wait until a table becomes available (but I could see several empty tables). Had to wait ten minutes. I asked for poached eggs but could not eat them when they eventually arrived as, for some reason, they are served on soggy white bread and I have a gluten intolerance. Overall this Hotel leaves a lot to be desired. I asked to see a Manager to discuss my points but none was available. There are many far better Hotels in the Ballsbridge area for a lot less money. Really, The Herbbert Park Hotel is not worth it!",2,2014,05,21
213,View was terrible.,"The room we had was for 3 adults.  Not very large and our view was of a roof, nothing else.
It was a long walk from our coach to the lobby and had to wait for someone to hold the gate while ourt driver backed up.
The staff were nice and helpful and breakfast very good.",3,2014,05,20
213,Staff a let down...,"Living close to the Hotel we arranged to meet with friends as we did same last year. The experience last year was good, the restaurant was excellent food and service...But how things have changed within a year...We decided to have bar meal as we already had lunch at work earlier..so we waited, waited waited to order refreshments, I waved my arm to attract the waitress attention, think she had blinkers on as she was more concerned waht was happening at front desk. Eventually gor her attention, pity she had a scowl on her face!! Ayhow got refreshments then ordered bar food..again we waited..waited waited...when food arrived it was warm..not hot..but in fairness the sea bass was lovely. We were going to book our friends in for a treat next month now we changed our mind and will look elsewhere after this poor performance from Herbert Park . Its really went down in a year, not same attention to customers .The staff we had were poor but the change over was better but nothing what it was like in 2013 .Sad to write this review.",3,2014,05,18
213,Great city hotel in the garden of the Herbert Park,"Stayed for one night.  I had forgotten what a lovely hotel it is. I believe that I had gotten a great rate, super value for the quality in comparison to the city centre hotels.  I am really delighted with the value.  The hotel backs on to the park and was delightful in the sunshine. Rooms are well appointed they may be a tiny bit worn but really well maintained. The hotel is just a ""short hop"" on the very regular service to town.  I can't rate this hotel highly enough",5,2014,05,18
213,People make the difference.,"This is a well appointed hotel (ideally located near Aviva Stadium and the wonderful RDS)modern and clean  with a welcoming ambience. Bedrooms are a good size and comfortable. What makes this hotel so very special is its' staff. Egla and her front of house team are excellent at what they do. Even at her busiest, Egla is always smiling, totally professional and nothing is too much trouble for her or her colleagues. They set this hotel apart from its competition.",5,2014,05,17
213,Great Hotel in Ballsbridge,Enjoying a wonderful pint of Guinness in the bar before the Lenister v Ulster Pro12 semi final. You should drop in when in the area. Many thanks Egla and all the staff for making us so welcome. We will be back with you for a week in August. Can't wait. ,5,2014,05,17
213,Great business hotel,"We were here on St. Patrick's weekend and since we booked a little late, we missed out on hotels close to the center. For a holiday like St Paddy's, this hotel is a little bit out of the way. We mostly took the bus but used cabs as well for very early appointments and so it was not convenient. We enjoyed the hotel though; it was clean, had a luxurious feel and they have toiletries that you won't usually find in other hotels. The room and the bed were of very good size. The complimentary WiFi works well in the room. We did not try the breakfast nor the restaurant so I can not comment about that. I am glad that there were good restaurant to choose from within a block from the hotel. Since it is in a quiet location, you will have no trouble sleeping at night. This is the kind of hotel that I would choose when travelling for business; however I would consider being closer to city center for other purposes.",5,2014,05,14
213,Gluten Free in Dublin,"We stayed at the Herbert Park Hotel in Dublin for three nights,   last week,   the hotel is
convenient to the city and was very clean and nice,   
anyone who travels from the US to Ireland knows that you arrive very early in the morning,
we got to the hotel about 7am Irish time,        I had requested an early check in and was told
we would get it,  if available,        this is a huge bonus,   the first thing a visitor from the US
needs in Ireland is a rest from the flight,   as it is overnight,       we got a room, (only one ready
at that time) and were sleeping by 8am.        It is not guaranteed but they will give it,  if they
have one ready.                We had dinner in the bar area each night,   I enjoyed delicious gluten free
food,   it is very easy to eat Gluten Free in Ireland and almost all restaurants cater to it and
understand it very well.             Parking will cost you ten euro a night,  the location is good,  with
bars and restaurants in walking distance",4,2014,05,13
213,Not worth the money,"
I stayed here for 4 nights while visiting Dublin. 
Should be a 3.5 star. 

Ladies!!-->no hair dyer, and no plugs in the bathroom. 

No coffee or tea in the room. You can purchase in the hotel. I decided to walk across the street to Insomina to get a real coffee. If I had to pay for it might as well be good. 
Not a problem to get outside I just found it odd that coffee wasn't complementary as most hotels with this rating would offer it. 

The rooms need a facelift. Wall paper peeling, couches have stains. 
Again, not an issue if price and rating reflected that. 

There are a few bars located on the main street and obviously that is convenient. There's a few hotels on that street so that bars tend to have international patrons which for me was nice as I was traveling on my own. 

Considering how the weather is so off and on in Dublin ( Ireland as a whole) my chances of walking from the hotel to the city centre was limited. The upside is that there is a bus you can take (# 4 or 7) just outside the hotel that I took. (Approx €2.40 per trip).  Had I known this I probably would have picked a hotel closer to the city centre or in Hanover Quay. 

Reception was ok. 
I needed something printed and they printed it for me at no charge. 

Called taxis for me when needed.

213,Pretty durn good,"The Herbert Park is a good, 4-star, business oriented hotel.  If you have business in this area, I do recommend it.  As it is a bit off the main streets, it is quiet.  Rooms are large and well appointed.

On checking in, I did have a bit of a wrangle over mini-bar frigo, which was not working.  Two technical inspections pronounced that it was working, but ""just slow to cool"".  I felt like I was in a Monty Python sketch about the dead parrot.  The next day I put my foot down, they swapped it out, and all was well.  But I did feel yanked about over an obvious issue.

Also, when I checked in, they ran my credit card in US dollars, rather than asking whether I preferred local currency (Euro) or the dollar.  I did not discover this until I checked out.  I did not want a dollar billing and was miffed that I was not given the choice.  You have been warned.

The room was comfortable, clean, and quiet.  The Internet was great.  TV was not -- few channels, and no BBC World News.

Laundry charges: Man's shirt on a hanger: €7; folded: €8; underwear: €4.50; pair of socks: €3.50.

The resto is good, but brekkie has its quirks.  The yogurt, La Fermiere, is the best I have had anywhere, and comes in an attractive ceramic pot.  Take it with you.  Chef ensures that at least half the bacon is crispy.  They serve blood sausage!  Yum!  But, the coffee comes in a metal pot and is cold in no time.  The buffet scrambled eggs are too runny for me and the other eggs, also served buffet style, are too well done.  Dang nab it, I like a runny yolk but you'll not find it there.

The neighborhood is rich in restaurant choices within a three minute walk (well, five, if the traffic lights do not favour you).  I had only good meals whilst there.",4,2014,04,20
213,Should be 5 Star !!,"Myself and my husband stayed here last night, We arrived late around 11 o clock we found the receptionist really friendly and left a great impression , our room was fantastic flatscreen tv ,king bed everything was very clean and modern we wanted a cup of tea or coffee which wasn't in the room ,there was a notice stating tea,coffee and biscuits would be served to the room for a €3.50 charge , however we choose to go to the bar to have our coffee and see some of the hotel, again staff were courteous and friendly. We went for the Easter package which cost €135.00 for 1 night this included carparking, breakfast a bottle of wine and also late check out.  I did have to phone reception for a wine opener but again staff were very prompt to come to the room. Breakfast had a great choice and we had a lovely table overlooking the park, our reason for coming to the Herbert was to be near the RDS and the staff were fantastic we were able to leave our car there at no extra charge for the day .The park on the grounds of the hotel are very romantic, there is a beautiful lake with swans and ducks and we really enjoyed our walk there this morning. The staff really make this place everyone was so nice and really welcoming we will be def return. There was a minor and a very minor negative our air con didn't work in the room and it was extremely warm this was room 229, however this wouldnt put me off returning really looking forward to returning again. Keep up the Good work.",5,2014,04,12
213,Trip down memory lane,"My American boyfriend and I recently stayed in the Herbert Park. It has special memories for us as it was where we fatted on his first visit to Dublin in 2008. It was as good as we had remembered. We found the front of house staff to he very friendly, welcoming and knowledgable and it was a pleasure dealing with them. We stayed during the Munster v Leinster match and there was a great atmosphere in the hotel that evening. Our rate did not include breakfast so we ate elsewhere in the mornings. Out from was spotless with a very large king size bed, I did find the pillows a little hard and uncomfortable but other than that I couldn't fault anything. We will be returning again in the near future. The location is excellent and even though it is in the heart of bustling Ballsbridge our room was very quiet. Long live the Herbert Park Hotel 😊",4,2014,04,10
213,"Very nice hotel, fantastic location","Stayed here for Munster v Leinster; literally 10 mins walk to the Aviva.  The hotel itself is beautiful.  Lovely friendly welcome at reception.  Room was very nice; huge comfortable bed.  We had an awful view from our room, but I imagine the view from the other side is lovely - looking in to the park.

We ate at the bar in the evening; food was very nice.  Breakfast was a little disappointing.  As a vegetarian, there wasn't much choice for me.  The mushrooms had been boiled and left a little soggy.  No fried potatoes or hash browns.  No beans.  So for me, it was egg, soggy mushrooms and tomato.  However, the buffet table had gorgeous fresh fruit and pastries.

Overall a great stay and I would definitely return.",4,2014,04,07
213,Home from home,"This is our favourite hotel in Dublin and we have stayed here many times. The location suits us, near the park, close to good restaurants and bars and the R.D.S. and Aviva stadium. It is just a short bus or taxi  journey into  the centre of Dublin or a pleasant fifteen to twenty minute walk .  
The rooms are comfortable ,well equipped and quiet and some have lovely views over Herbert Park .There are no tea and coffee making facilities in the rooms but you can get some delivered to your room for a small charge.However it would be nice to be able to make a drink in the room .For us that would be the icing on the cake.
The lobby/bar area has a mixture of comfortable settees and chairs and is a good place to relax with a drink or to have a  bar snack or coffee etc.There is usually a great atmosphere here on days when there is an event or a rugby match nearby.
We have always found the reception and bar staff welcoming and friendly and we will continue to stay here when we visit Dublin.",4,2014,04,05
213,Rude staff!!,"Stayed here for St. Patricks wknd. Found the hotel to be nice and the rooms comfortable but the staff were so obnoxious, unhelpful and down right rude. The reception staff need to be thought some manners and how to smile. As
For paying for parking , ridiculous. The night porter and night manager who were probably having a difficult night considering the wknd that was in it but really need to learn not to take there humour or issues out on other guests.. I will not stay here again ever. ",1,2014,04,04
213,Staff lack training,"Stayed here for 2 nights last week, overall a pleasant place  to stay but restaurant staff are woefully undertrained, they show you to a table for breakfast and you would be lucky if they asked you if you wanted tea or coffee, certainly no one asks if you would like anything off the menu, fried breakfast is laid out in a buffet and very average, (scrambled egg grey). Lots of fruit for breakfast though which is nice. Bread offer very average.  Lounge staff seem more clued in and on the ball.  On check out the receptionist took a call and delayed us, even though he had a colleague beside him who could have taken it, one of my pet hates when you are being served by someone and they answer the phone and have a conversation!!!  Only one step up from Bewleys but at a much steeper price.",3,2014,04,02
213,No Tea & Coffee facilities in the room!,"An overnight stay. Good hotel, nice location, staff were friendly. Bedroom was good all very clean, big bed. Was looking forward to a cuppa when I got to my room after a long day of travelling but there was none, why? This is bog standard in any hotel, even in a B&B, it is a shame they want to charge you for the privilege of having a cuppa in your room, all a bit irish to be asking people to pay for it! Shame.",3,2014,03,31
213,Yawn !!,"Stayed one night B&B in an executive room,staff were nice,everything else was average and bland,with the exception of the aircon in the room ( which didn't work ) and the price,would expect a little better from a fourstar.Realistically a threestar with pretensions.",3,2014,03,30
213,Electric Run overnight stay,"We stayed in the HP on Saturday night as we were taking part in the Electric Run in the RDS.  Our room was beautiful as was the hotel.  Service and food in the bar the afternoon we arrived was brilliant - the girls serving were lovely and very attentive.  Nothing was too much trouble.  There were families, couples and singletons everywhere and everyone seemed just as happy as the others.  
Breakfast was really lovely, although it was included in our overnight accommodation so not sure how much it usually costs.  Finally a hotel that knows how to make poached eggs!!!  And our view of the park topped off a perfect breakfast.  We arrived about 9:30am but I did notice that the staff still welcomed latecomers after 10am, which I thought was only right in such a good hotel.  The staff throughout were welcoming and helpful.  
As an added extra the shower was great, which is so badly lacking in some hotels.  There are so many great restaurants on the doorstep too so unless you really want to go into Dublin you don't have to.
I will definitely stay here again if I get the chance.",5,2014,03,27
213,Superior Room but no tea/coffee making facilities,"The room was spacious, bed massive, dressing gowns lovely and the jets in the bath looked like they would be fab even though we didn't use them. Just the right distance from the centre, a short taxi journey way.

Only bad thing about the room was that there was no tea/coffee making facilities!!",4,2014,03,25
213,Excellent service,"The Herbert Park just keeps getting better. Though I have stayed here before it still impresses me, where many hotels have lowered standards this was obviously never a consideration with the management of the Herbert Park. To sum it up - Great location, handy parking,  great staff and beautiful rooms. Highly recommended.",5,2014,03,18
213,Best bed ever!,"Spent 2 nights here with my husband whilst attending a 2 day event in Dublin. Hotel was lovely, very nice clean & classic decor. The room (408) was spotless, loved the independently operated air conditioning & the shower had loads of hot water with plenty of pressure. The highlight for me was the queen sized bed - so much room, it was like having a bed all to myself! Also the wifi speed was brilliant. 
Small downside was no tea/coffee facilities in room - it was available for approx £3.50 (inc delivery) but tbh, I like to make my own & not have to make myself presentable for strangers in the morning. 
Also whilst the location is perfect for attending anything in the RDS/Aviva/Ballsbridge area it doesn't suit for the city centre or The O2. I booked knowing the location but for anyone unsure it's worth considering. Minimal dealings with staff but what we had was perfect, we were allowed to check in a little earlier around 1pm & this was much appreciated. ",4,2014,03,17
213,c2c concert,"Great location to o2, hotel was clean and comfortable. Staff were friendly and courteous. Breakfast was a bit pricey at 19.95 per head, other than that we enjoyed our stay, we will definitely stay again!",4,2014,03,17
213,Second stay (rugby Weekend ),"This was my second stay at this Hotel and it was equally as good as the previous visit.
The room was absolutely spotless and well maintained.#

The hotel was exceptionally busy as there was a Six Nations Rugby match at the Aviva Stadium just five minutes away but an excellent level of service was maintained especially by the very attentive and charming reception staff.

The choice and quality of food at breakfast was really good and the Restaurant staff were very polite and efficient

.The Hotel is ideally located, just a short distance from the city with transport links close by.

My only gripe is that there are not any Tea/Coffee making facilities in the rooms.",5,2014,03,10
213,Good breakfast & fine location,For rugby the location is perfect. Quiet park behind hotel & city centre a 25 minute walk. Taxi travel always available. Good service & rooms ok not fantastic. Great breakfast in a quiet breakfast area. Bar service works well allowing you to relax in a group while you are served what you ordered. Staff friendly & helpful. Restaurant food on site good & other restaurants and bars within walking distance. ,4,2014,03,09
213,a pleasant surprise,"We were looking for a hotel in the Ballsbridge area and came across a name we didn't know. The hotel is modern and beautiful situated in Herbert Park. The rooms are smart and comfortable. Excellent snacks and meals are served in the lounge until late at night.  The staff is very friendly and efficient. All-in-all the hotel exceeded our expectations.  There was one minor snag getting there - Google Maps gave us a route to the back entrance on Ballsbridge Terrace when the main entrance is via Anglesea Road. No hint of this on the hotel website! Fortunately I had time to do some research with Google Streetview.  Once there, parking was no problem - an exception in traffic-bound Dublin.",5,2014,03,07
213,Great place to stay ,Have stayed at the Herbert Park on a number of occasions. Staff are always friendly and very helpful.   Good food and comfortable rooms. Great location with good restaurants bars and the RDS all within minutes. Also very handy for the Aviva stadium. ,5,2014,03,02
213,Feb stay,"I regularly stay in the Herbert Park on business. The hotel is well located close to the centre of town, within walking distance of a lot of amenities such as RDS, Aviva and good restaurants and pubs. Service is good and the food in the hotel is very nice. The rooms are spacious and well appointed with all the normal offerings one would expect in a business hotel. My only personal quibble is that the bed is a little hard for my liking. Overall though it's a fine hotel and my first choice when travelling to Dublin.",4,2014,03,01
213,Very good!,This hotel is in a fabulous location. The rooms were very clean and very spacious also. The food in the restaurant was beautiful and also had very good choice of food on the menu. I would highly recommend this hotel for a great night to stay in Dublin.,4,2014,02,22
213,"Very nice hotel, great location","A short walk from Lansdowne Road and about twenty minutes into central Dublin.  Very pleasant, efficient staff, nice rooms, near nice pubs too.  Room service meals excellent.  Only downside, no tea/coffee facilities in room which was a little limiting.",4,2014,02,13
213,Great location,"Comfortable, large clean rooms, most attentive staff, well located for the town centre and the Aviva stadium. Could do with tea and coffee making facilities in the room but apart from this easily resolved item, a great place to stay.",5,2014,02,10
213,Super Service,"I have been staying in the Herbert Park Hotel a couple of times on business and with groups. This is a time when you sometimes just need some assistance without having the time to check if everything you asked for has been done. In the Herbert Park Hotel staff are very helpful, friendly and make you feel at home and well looked after. The location is just beside the RDS, and on the other side there is the superb Herbert Park for exercise or just a bit of fresh air. Ideal!",5,2014,02,10
213,Location perfection!,"We chose to stay at Herbert Park Hotel when we were in Dublin for the International Rugby match and it proved to be the perfect choice. The staff and their service was without fault, our room was spotlessly clean and comfortable and there was the most wonderful atmosphere in the lounge/bar area as everyone enjoyed the occasion. The location is great as it is easy to get into the city centre also to visit the nearby village of Sandymount or to use the Dart to go along the coast to enjoy the sea at Dalkey or Killiney.",5,2014,02,09
213,Just one night,Stayed just one night but was very impressed by the helpfulness an friendliness of reception staff.The log in to WI Fi is a bit complicated but as soon as you connect the signal strength is excellent.Great location for RDS and Aviva Stadium.,5,2014,02,08
213,Superb Herbert Park,"My wife and I paid a return visit to the Herbert Park Hotel and again our already high expectations were surpassed. The location is ideal and its immediate proximity to one of our favourite restaurants in Dublin (Roly's) is an added bonus. The check-in was faultless and the room and facilities are quite excellent. The staff are hand-picked and consistently demonstrate a friendliness and a willingness to 'go the extra mile'. For example, my wife approached the reception desk to pick up the Irish Times. Unfortunately, they were sold out. A staff member overheard the exchange and immediately insisted on going out to a nearby shop to get a copy of the paper. It was delivered to the room within minutes. 

There is but one area that perhaps need attention. The cooked breakfast is not cooked to order but is a self service option in a buffet style set-up. Nothing can replace the experience of a freshly cooked breakfast. 
The Herbert Park is our favourite hotel in Dublin and is strongly recommended for its comfort, location but above all, for its exceptional staff.",4,2014,02,08
213,'Always reliable',I have been staying in the hotel since 2000 and return regularly given the excellent service always evident. Superbly located adjacent to Herbert Park which is great for strolling through. Staff are extremely helpful and there is always a welcome with a smile. Thank you.,4,2014,02,06
213,Great Visit,"We have stayed in this hotel on numerous occasions when coming to Dublin for the rugby. It is conveniently located a five minute walk away from the Aviva Stadium and is a short taxi drive away from St Stephens Green and the city centre. The staff are very friendly and efficient, especially Gerard at reception who very kindly upgraded our rooms which was much appreciated as they were large, spacious and comfortable with great views of Herbert Park. The lobby has a bar area which serves good food and has a great atmosphere on game days. Overall I could not fault this hotel and we definitely plan on staying here again.",5,2014,02,03
213,very nice,Very nice hotel in a good location.  The rooms are comfortable and the staff is professional and helpful.  There are several decent pubs and restaurants in the area.  The lobby area offers a nice food and drink selection.  Dublin city center is a quick cab ride or you can even take the bus to Temple Bar/Stephen's Green which is located close by at the US Embassy.,4,2014,02,02
213,excellent hotel,Hotel is in a great location.  There are quite a number of pubs and restaurants in the area. Rooms were comfortable. Staff was friendly and helpful. Breakfast selection was great.  There is also a nice park by the hotel.,5,2014,02,01
213,I see changes for the better each time I visit,"This hotel is conveniently located - downtown and the various convention centers are all closely.
In the general area there are a number of excellent restaurants as well.
The food quality and the service have improved over the last few visits, same at the Front Office.
Friendly and efficient.  I noticed that this hotel is also certified ISO 9001 which helps improve the overall quality.
Keep going !",4,2014,01,30
213,C. Doherty  Always glad to go back.,We stay here a few times every year-never disappointing .Being in the lovely Park is a great bonus and there's a nice village feel to the area with good pubs and restaurents-try Crows and Roleys. Handy if there's something on at the RDS. Staff are very pleasant. We'll be back.,5,2014,01,25
213,Has to be the best hotel in Dublin,"The Herbert Park Hotel in Ballsbridge must be one of the best hotels in Dublin. I have stayed in a few but this one is the place where i spend most of my time. The hotel is modern, the rooms are comfortable and stylish and the staff are the best I have came across. They are friendly and professional and really make you feel welcome.

The food in the hotel is 2nd to none and there is no problem with parking.

There are plenty of bars and some nice restauranuts in the area and as the hotel sits next to the Herbert Park its in a lovely quiet area.

If you are heading to Dublin and want to stay in a top class hotel with top class staff then the Herbert Park is the place to stay.",5,2014,01,24
213,Very nice.,"I have only nice things to say about this hotel. Very polite and friendly staff. The rooms were spotless. The bed was fantastic, and the location was great. There was a very nice area around the hotel, a nice quiet park with a lot of birdlife.. So we really didn`t feel like we were staying in a city.. We usually waked into the center and it took about 20 - 25 minutes. But taxi was about 9 - 10 eur. We will definitely stay here again when we are in Dublin.",5,2014,01,24
213,Dublin overnight stay,"Stayed in Herbert park last weekend with my family. Very good location with lovely park nearby and lovely treat with bottle of procecco  in the room. Check in staff extremely welcoming and efficient. As guests of hotel our parking was free. Breakfast was superb huge range of fruit, cereal, pastries, hot food and plenty tea an coffee.  Our room was fine only complaint was no tea and coffee making facility in room which one would expect in this standard of hotel. Pot of tea for one in bar was costly at €4.70 which was nicely presented but overpriced.",4,2014,01,19
213,A Dublin Escape,"A lovely hotel in a great location.We have stayed on many occasions and always enjoyed the ambiance and the professionalism of the staff. It is a modern hotel yet retains a lovely warmth and character.The service is first class and the rooms are lovely to relax in. The food is first class with varied menus and after eating in many of the local hostelries over the years we now prefer to eat in house.Free parking available underground as part of package
Very accessible to Dublin City Centre and the many attractions of south Dublin. Dart Train service only a seven minute walk away.Looking forward to returning in the summer",5,2014,01,18
213,A really Fabulous Friday,This hotel is in a great location-lovely area and only 8-10 euro in a taxi to Stephens Green. The fabulous Friday package is amazing value and a real treat for  a Friday in Dublin. I travel to Dublin alot at weekends and having stayed in many hotels and apartments over the last few years I would now only choose the Herbert Park.,5,2014,01,17
213,Most expensive cup of tea in Ireland . . . probably the world!,"I have just had a lovely lunch with my sister and Mum in the lobby of the Herbert Park Hotel.  It was a treat for my sister's birthday as we know it is more expensive than other eating establishments in the area but the food is good and the atmosphere is nice and relaxed.  

As usual, the food was tasty and the service was very good too. However, when we received the bill, the pot of tea for 3 people (i.e. a pot of hot water containing 3 tea bags) cost us €14.10 (i.e. €4.70 PER CUP accounting for one third of the total bill)!!!!!!!!!   If it was a cafe on the Champs Elysees I would expect to perhaps pay this price but not in the lobby of a hotel in the middle of Ballsbridge.

As I said above, we knew it would be more expensive to eat there than other places but we didn't expect it to be that much more expensive.  It is an absolute disgrace.  Who did the costing?  How can a cup of tea be priced as half of the price of a sandwich?  It doesn't make sense when you take into account the ingredients in both.  Even by charging €2 or even €2.50 for a cup of tea, there is still a decent profit so why upset your customers by charging €4.70?

I am aware of the phrase ""Caveat Emptor"" so it was our responsibility to check the price of the tea before we ordered it but I just want to make other buyers beware before they make the same mistake as us.  

We are still going through tough times in Ireland so everyone is more careful about what they spend their precious money on.  When people do make a decision to actually go out and treat themselves by going out for lunch in the middle of their working day, don't spoil the treat by charging exorbitant prices for tea!

It left a very sour taste in our mouths and unfortunately we will not be going again and I would urge others to do the same until the price of a cup of tea is reduced.",1,2014,01,17
213,Brilliant Hotel,"My wife and I often travel to Dublin on business/pleasure and regularly stay at the Herbert Park.
We have never been disappointed with any stay there and often avail of the Indulgence Package which is great value.  The staff are helpful and courteous and every room we have ever stayed in has been spacious, spotlessly clean, and comfortable.  The view looking out on the Herbert Park from the bedrooms and restaurant is beautiful and would hardly make you believe that you are staying in a City Hotel.  Breakfast is well worth having, we both have travelled widely, but the breakfast we most enjoy is always in the Herbert Park.
Staff on reception are  particularly welcoming, friendly and helpful.  On our last visit just before Christmas 2013, I mentioned when I was booking that my wife's birthday was approaching and we were upgraded to a beautiful luxury room.  While it is only a short walk to many local restaurants and wine bars,  the food in the restaurant and foyer is excellent and great value",5,2014,01,17
213,"Great hotel, staff, location and food","Great Hotel with friendly staff.

The Hotel is located in a very nice area not for from the city center. There are some nice pubs and restaurants just around the corner. Furthermore the hotel offers very nice foor for a decent price!

The rooms are good and clean!",4,2014,01,14
213,Great modern rooms,We stayed for 2 nights for an event at the RDS. This is just a couple of minutes walk from the RDS so very convenient. Also close to Aviva Stadium. The hotel is on the edge of a beautiful park. Our room on the fourth floor was south facing. It was quite big with a large king sized bed. There were 2 comfortable armchairs which were great for reading. Good lighting. ,5,2014,01,12
213,Great Value great location can't wait to return,"Great value booked for two nights to attend the rugby back at the end of Dec, breakfast was top notch with plenty of choice . Great location with only a 30 min walk up to st Stephens green and Grafton street  . Can't wait to return ",5,2014,01,12
213,Nice hotel. Most unprofessional management ever encountered!,"Stayed for 3 nights over Christmas and most things were very good except the Management on duty. Very rude, confrontational, impersonal and completely unsympathetic to customers needs. If you happen to have an issue with anything you will be confronted in a condensing and aggressive way. Frontline staff were courteous and attentive but the Managers above them were anything but. When asking for assistance from more senior Management above them they will become even more aggressive and uncooperative. We will be detailing the particulars with senior management/owners and will update the outcome here. My advice, yes stay in this hotel as it is very convenient but beware of incredibly poor, badly trained duty management! The worst we have ever encountered.",1,2014,01,11
213,Good food and nice atmosphere,"I feel this hotel should have a better overall rating than it does!  We stayed here as part of a tour, and I must say this place looks better in person than in most photos I saw.  It's kind of oddly shaped and stuck behind what appears to be an apartment building, so the main entrance doesn't really feel as such.  It doesn't have much ""curb appeal.""  But the staff is friendly and the restaurant is delicious.  Their breakfast buffet is massive and the dining area is very pretty.  It's kind of a compact hotel, but doesn't feel that way at all.  I can't comment on proximity to shops/pubs, etc. since we did not walk around either night we were here (massive jet lag!), but from what we heard from others, there were some very nice places nearby.  The room we stayed in overlooked the parking area and while it was quaint and European-looking, it really didn't provide us with much of a few.  The twin beds were, oddly, pushed together even though we weren't a couple, but we were able to move them apart easily.  One thing we appreciated was the bellhop showing us the features of our room, especially the key card holder where you place your key to activate electricity (we would not have known this otherwise!).  Overall it was a very pleasant stay.",4,2014,01,09
213,BT Young Scientist event overnight stay with Herbert,"Stayed over for 2nights while attending the event.
I was very impressed with the hotel. The staff were excellent and very helpful. The hotel was spotlessly clean and the rooms were large and spacious. The bed was so comfy. No tea and cofee making facility in room was my only disappointment. Free WiFi for guests and the lounge was nice to relax with a cofee. Plenty of pubs across the road and ideally suited for RDS or Lansdowne Road stadium. We ate out at the Baan Thai restaurant opposite the hotel which was good. Paddy Cullens pub for a pint or two of guiness. 
Dublin is an great city and I would definitely recommend the Herbert Park hotel.",5,2014,01,09
213,Perfectly Fine Hotel,"I can't fault the hotel much save to say it's a bit impersonal. the public spaces feel a tad cold and the rooms although large and comfortable are not exactly charming or particularly stylist.  Breakfast was great and staff helpful and kind.  The Merrion is in a different league but then again it has an extra star and charges accordingly.
great location for the RDS  or Landsdown Road.  Nice walk into town if you like to walk and lots of fabulous restos in Dublin now.  Try Fade St Social or Rustic Stone or Hugos  if you like fresh food from seasonal ingreedients.",3,2014,01,05
213,Appalling customer service - worst I have ever seen.,"I had coffee in this hotel last year with my husband and 3 month old baby. My husband left before me as he had a lunch meeting. I used the toilet before leaving and on the way out the door (wheeling a pram, bear in mind), a hotel employee opened the door for me and said to me that the hotel toilets were for customer use only. Taken aback, I explained I had coffee there just before. The employee seemed embarrassed and apologised, saying he had been asked by his manager to tell me this.

Unwilling to let this gross mistake by the hotel pass, I asked to speak to the person who had instructed him to advise me of this. It turned our to be the General Manager of the hotel. When he came over to me and I explained their error, he refuted my claim and insisted he had seen me come in from outside to use the toilet (he hadn't...in fact we had parked in the basement car park and come up to the hotel via the lift). He was unpleasant, unfriendly and really unkind in his handling of this. 

I left the hotel for a second time, in disbelief as to what had just happened. I was extremely upset and rang my husband who was having a lunch meeting in a  nearby restaurant. I explained what had happened and he came straight over and we both went in to see the General Manager. My husband, very politely, explained that a mistake had been made and still the General Manager insisted I'd come in from outside. He was rude and aggressive and again, very unpleasant to deal with. We both left scratching our heads over what had just happened but resolute that we would never set door in the hotel again.

As an interesting epilogue, I rang the hotel to ask who I would direct a letter of complaint to and they said the General Manager! When I asked if the complaint was in respect of the General manager, they didn't know who I should send it to! So I went onto the Companies Registration Office website and paid €3.50 to get a list of the directors. I wrote a letter of complaint to the first director on the list. I did get a written response to my complaint...but guess who the company director had tasked with responding to me...the General Manager! I was absolutely disgusted. This is a hotel that clearly does not operate any level of acceptable customer service and whose directors couldn't care less. Disgraceful.",1,2014,01,05
213,Loved our family stay.,"Had a great stay with 3 kids in an in connecting room. Rooms were comfortable. We particularly liked the security of key passes in the lifts. A cot and kettle were placed in our room without prompting and a DVD player for older kids. 
Breakfast was one of the best we have had - variety and quality fantastic.
Staff at all times were friendly and so welcoming. A night porters offer of a cup of tea when downstairs with a baby at 5.30 am was just so welcome.
Food in the bar was fabulous. Kids portions perfect. 
At every stage staff were one step ahead of our needs.",5,2014,01,02
213,Very pleasant stay,"Hi all,
Just returned from a night in this great hotel. Have to say we really enjoyed our stay. I choose this hotel as myself and my wife were going to the races at leopardstown over the xmas hols..I went for the package which included free parking, bed and breakfast and also free bottle of bubbly on the 5th floor which is all executive rooms. The package only cost €150 which I thought was very reasonable. The staff were also very helpful and polite,  a special mention to sandra in reservations for her professionalism. The bar was busy enough in the evening as there was a rugby match in the rds, I thought this added to the atmosphere in the bar. The only bad point was the breakfast,  although plentiful myself and wife both thought bacon and sausages were tastless and soggy... all in all we really enjoyed our experience and will definitely return, (work on the breakfast!!)..

Thanks
Paul",4,2014,01,02
213,New Years Eve,"The hotel is in a good area of Dublin and is close to the city centre ( 5-10 mins by bus or taxi)We booked last minute for new years eve night out. The staff at reception were helpful. The rooms were clean and basic, the heating was good but there was no extractor fan in the bathroom to let our the steam, As I didn't want my hair to get wet from the steam, I had to wait for it to disperse after my husbands shower.
The staff in the bar area were courteous and efficient as were all the hotel staff.
The one complaint I would have about the room is that there are no tea/coffee facilities in the room which surely is a basic facility.The reception staff informed me that tea/coffee could be ordered on room service. No one wants to wait for the time it would take, the cost and the tipping involved just for a cup of tea!!!!! Please note.
We did not have breakfast so I cannot comment on the food.",3,2014,01,02
213,Nice modern hotel in good location ,"Just stayed here for the one night and was very impressed. Its in a really nice part of Dublin within walking distance to the city. The hotel is pretty new and built to a high standard, really nice reception area and bar. The rooms are quiet big and very comfortable. The breakfast was excellent and all staff were very friendly. I will definitely stay here again. The only negative I would have are the shower curtains, surely worth replacing with a door, curtains look cheap and the hotel would surely save money over time not having to wash multiple towels daily as a result of guests using to mop floor...",5,2014,01,01
213,Recent visit,"Stayed overnight on 28 December 2013 and requested inter connecting rooms which were provided.  The hotel is well located for access to the RDS, Aviva and Dublin.  The are plenty of bars and restaurants close by so you can stay in Dublin 4 without having to go into the city centre.  The staff were friendly, helpful and efficient.  Wifi is free (disregard the information in the room guide) and car parking is €10 per day.  Thought our booking included breakfast but it did not so BEWARE those booking via Rooms.com.  We thought our room decoration could have been in better order and mentioned this when checking out, we were advised that the hotel is in the process of redecorating 5 rooms per week to improve upon the current standard.  Would stay here again.",4,2013,12,30
213,"Honestly, it has a great deal to offer...","Firstly the Many positives. This Hotel is in Prime Location for a visit to Dublin. Close to the Aviva Stadium and the RDS and only a short hop by bus or taxi to Stephens Green. Within a 2 minute walk you have a fantastic selection of  really good restaurants including Chinese, Thai, Italian and contempary Cuisine. As an added bonus there areat least 3 Traditional Irish Pubs also within the same 2 minute walk. The Hotel offers secure Underground Car Parking with direct access to your room from the car park. The Rooms are Spotlessly Clean with a large comfortable bed, Flat Screen TV, free Guest Wi-Fi, mini Bar, a large bathroom and an in Room Safe. The Reception Staff are very friendly and helpful. For this quality of hotel it is good value for money, especially if you are travelling as a couple. The Continental Breakfast offers something for everyone.

Negative for me  especially as as Solo traveller are few , however the Cost,( especially for Guests), and Quality of the Hot Irish Breakfast is a big negative for me. The practice of cooking  all the food at 7am and letting the food sit in a food warmer really lets down this Hotel.

A freshly cooked breakfast at a cost of around €12 before you check out would in my opinion leave a far better parting impression of an otherwise very pleasent and comfortable stay.",4,2013,12,30
213,Excellent hospitality,My wife and I along with four friends Stayed in the Herbert Park Hotel for the weekend it was excellent. Staff friendly and welcoming great food recommend as first choice hotel in Dublin. Wifi access was great all over hotel.,5,2013,12,29
213,Staying in Dublin an Excellent Choice,"I have never been disappointed while staying in the Herbert Park Hotel.Very friendly staff greeting you on your arrival and that warm and pleasant welcome is always consistent
The rooms are always spotless and the beds are very comfortable of which to me is a must !!!
.A good area within easy reach of town and a choice of  good restaurants nearby which is nice if your tired.",5,2013,12,28
213,Very Comfortable,Friendly staff and spotless room. My only reservation was the difficulty I has getting on to the wi-fi. The instructions were less than helpful - it kept rejecting me with no explanation.  It turns out you can only request 7 days access - I was staying for 8.  And you have to repeat the tra-la for every device.  Easier to go to the pub!,4,2013,12,25
213,Always a good choice,"Never been disappointed here. Service is good, hotel is nice and clean, rooms are big.

Downside is bathrooms are a little small e.g. No showers (it's in the bath) and it's not as full a service hotel as others in terms of a buzzing restaurant or cafe etc. but a nice choice in a good area within easy reach of town, and a hotel I never have any qualms about choosing.",4,2013,12,24
213,Tea for 2 €9.40!!!,"Attended hotel for lunch with a friend & ordered 2 teas. Shocked to discover the price was €9.40 which is outrageous for tea from standard tea bags & not loose tea leaves. I queried the bill & after 15 minutes waiting I eventually spoke to a Manageress. She informed me I was only waiting 3 minutes & the price of tea was standard for such a hotel, I found her unhelpful. Side of fries ordered with lunch were cold. 

To be fair, the waiting staff were professional & my friends Nicoise Salad was nice. Location & setting is pleasant. 

Management should review the manner in which they deal with complaints  & also their tea prices for standard tea bags!!  ",2,2013,12,19
213,Rugby weekend,"This is a great hotel to stay at. Excellent food, drink, rooms and craic. The staff are wonderful and a big thanks to Egle for all her help. The hotel is very close to the famous Royal Dublin Show grounds, the Aviva stadium and a nice walk to the centre of Dublin. We have stayed many times in the hotel and have already booked for the week of the Dublin Horse show. There are many restaurants in the vicinity and the lovely Herbert Park is a stones throw from the front door.",5,2013,12,18
213,Excellent!,Me and my wife stayed here last week and I have to say it was a very nice stay! The reception staff were very welcoming and the lady that served us in the restaurant was very nice and accommodating! It was a lovely place to stay! We'll defiantly stay here again on our next trip to the big smoke! Thanks for everything and happy Christmas!! Mr&Mrs O' Neill (Kilkenny),5,2013,12,17
213,Great Hotel,"A great hotel with friendly and attentive staff. Nice rooms and a great location.
I have stayed in this hotel many times both for business and leisure and always find it excellent.
The rooms are very comfortable and the hotel is bright and modern.",5,2013,12,16
213,Just a great Hotel,"Herbert Park , is just such a great hotel , so close to the city centre ,  walking distance to the Aviva , and beside a lovely park . The staff are very helpful and friendly , i would recommend to anyone .",5,2013,12,16
213,Ideal hotel in an ideal location,"I have stayed in the Herbert Park regularly on business (midweek only) for over 4 months now after staying in various hotels in the area with a similar price tag and think the level of service of the staff at the reception is excellent compared to other hotels in the area. The evening restaurant staff hold their own on certain nights of the week when the restaurant has half the covers that could be taken. The breakfast staff are friendly which makes a difference in the mornings.
The food is of very good standard in the restaurant (both evening meals and breakfast) 
The parking facilities are ideal if working or visiting the local area. The rooms are in very good order and cleanliness seems to be No1 priority which is very important in hotels. Tea/coffee facilities could be added to the rooms. The gym could be extended also as this is very small.
Easy to get on to the M50/Airport, Sandyford or city centre.

I will still keep staying there as long as I require accommodation in and around Dublin.",4,2013,12,15
213,A great hotel for the business traveller,"I have been staying at the Herbert Park Hotel at my frequent visits to Dublin for over 8 years now.  The customer service is excellent, the rooms are very clean, tasteful and 'zen' (not full of useless items).  The breakfast offers a great choice.  All by all, my preferred hotel in Dublin.",5,2013,12,15
213,Lovely comfortable hotel,"Great reception staff, large airy comfortable bedrooms with minibar. Good bathrooms. I had room service which arrived at exact time they stated. Breakfast was excellent with hot food cooked to order. 
The only thing I will say is that there was no tea / coffee facilities in the rooms otherwise no complaints.",4,2013,12,15
213,"Rip off extras, unfriendly staff","Booked a meeting room for a couple of hours, it was expensive but in fairness I knew the price when I booked the room. The hotel is in a great location and it is a lovely hotel. The desk service in particular is functional and somewhat abrupt. The staff say all the right things but it would be nice if they did it with a smile. However what was really maddening was the extras. They left a few bottles of water on the table and you would definitely got the impression that they were complimentary - they were the opposite, about €2.50 a pop. However the real coup de grace was the car parking charge. Even though we spent over €150 to book a room for a couple of hours they tried to charge an extra €10 for parking (subsequently reduced to €7.50 after a protest). When asked could this not be included in the charge and just about every other hotel validates car parking tickets we got a very abrupt ""no, it's not our policy"". It ruined a fairly ordinary and expensive few hours",2,2013,12,12
213,Disappointing,Lovely Hotel is a great location but very disappointed by Hotel Staff.  They were quite frankly rude and unfriendly. Everything was an inconvenience including checking out. The personal presentation of Staff should also be addressed.,2,2013,12,11
213,Spoilt by poor customer service.,Good location for RDS with clean rooms badly let down by unprofessional customer service. No tea and coffee rooms and made to feel an annoyance for requesting room service which took 20 minutes to arrive.,2,2013,12,08
213,"Like a good meal without salt, it lacks something","Excellent rooms, clean, spacious with a great bed and two comfortable chairs, my first impression was very positive.

On closer inspection the room, especially the bathroom is showing signs of wear. The upholstery on the chair is ripped, the wallpaper in the bathroom is peeling. Small issues but not what I would expect from a hotel that most consider to be one of the best in the area.

Perhaps my biggest complaint is the lack of consideration for us smokers (and no it's not the responsibility of a hotel to try and change our habits).

Unusually for the Republic is the no smoking rule, I don't mind this providing some facility is provided. When I asked I was informed that smoking was only allowed outside, and the are no seats provided, nor cover in the event of rain.

£100 per night and I am expected to walk across the parking lot and perch on a low garden wall, this I find appalling.",4,2013,12,04
213,Not good value for money,"Lovely hotel, have stayed here before a few years ago but was very disappointed that there were no tea and coffee making facilities in the room.  Also on the Saturday afternoon there was a powercut, there appeared to be emergency lighting in the stairwells but not in the corridors which I thought was illegal.  The power was off for several hours and I would have expected in a hotel of this standard to find a member of staff on each floor with a torch to guide people to their rooms as it was very difficult as many of the corridors are internal.  We were going to a birthday party at 5.30pm and the power only came on just before that which made it very rushed as by then it was pitch dark in the room and we were unable to shower etc.  No apology was made on check out it was just a shrug of the shoulders so in future will be staying elsewhere.",3,2013,11,28
213,Great location and great hotel,Stayed here on business to attend an awards ceremony. Situated in a great part of Dublin with easy access to the city centre. Hotel is great for business travellers. Friendly receptionists who are quick and efficient. Room was lovely with all modern features and facilities. Bed really comfortable.,4,2013,11,27
213,Beautiful location and a very good hotel,"Stayed here for one night before the rugby Autumn Internationals in November and would definitely recommend it. Beautiful location right on Herbert Park which is just stunning in autumn, and the rooms are lovely, clean and very spacious. I had read some reviews about poor front-of-house staff on here before I left but couldn't disagree more - they were very friendly at check-in, helped us sort our parking and were generally very courteous. We had breakfast delivered to the room the next morning and it was very tasty though the portions were a bit small if you weren't getting a full fry. Overall a really enjoyable stay and would definitely recommend it to others.",4,2013,11,26
213,P.R ,Great value Friday night offer beautiful room free parking bottle of bubbly and delicious breakfast in bed . Stayed for billy Joel concert in 02 which was excellent  . Went to rolys bistro for a meal beforehand  only two mins away and it was delicious .All in all a wonderful night,5,2013,11,24
213,"Hotel is 4*, but location 5*","I stayed for one week and I have to say that I really enjoyed my time. The Herbert park itself is just at the front door of the hotel. No matter if you do running or if you just want to go for a walk before breakfast. The room was big, breakfast very good and location excellent. The only bad thing was the air conditioning - very noisy - had to turn it off for the night. But overall you get really good value for the money.",5,2013,11,21
213,Ireland -v- Samoa,"My wife and I attend at least a couple of the Rugby Union International Matches at the Aviva Stadium, Dublin each year.  The Herbert park Hotel is located very close to the stadium in leafy Ballsbridge.  We had never stayed there before. After deciding we would attend the Samoa match on November 9, I set about looking for a Hotel close by, knowing that a previous favorite Hotel had changed beyond recognition and was out of the running.
The Herbert Park Hotel offered a very good deal considering it was ""a rugby weekend"".  The location is not only excellent and convenient, it is also quite beautiful, with Herbert Park, a Dublin City park, located right next to the Hotel.  At this time of year, it really is quite nice, with the leaves on the trees in full autumnal splendor.
The rooms are spacious and bright, with tasteful decor.  The staff are friendly and helpful and the breakfast is excellent.  We will return in the Spring for a ""Six Nations Match"".",5,2013,11,14
213,"Not bad, could be better","we stayed here once before 3 years ago and liked it, so decided to to stay again. 
We drove into the underground carpark to find no spaces available. I went upstairs to reception & told the man at reception. He wasn't very apologetic, or bothered really, but said he would send the porter down. The Porter was very nice, and ended up moving a staff car for us so we could have the space. It is a large underground carpark, but sectioned off in areas for nearby offices & apartments, which makes it very small for a hotel carpark. We also found out that people who were at the nearby Aviva at a match were able to use this to park during the game! This seems crazy, and should only be for residents if it is such a small carpark!

I read from other reviews that the reception staff seem a bit unfriendly, and I have to agree. Our stay was fine, but they really need to do something about their front of house reception staff. They are very cold and they really need to act friendlier! We had no issues apart from the parking, which we also were not happy to find that they charge €10 a night for!!! The room was clean and comfortable. Room cost €115, but didn't include breakfast, so a little steep, especially for having to pay for parking also!.",3,2013,11,11
213,Delivers what is expected,The hotel is well located in a comfortable and leafy suburb of Dublin. Rooms are spacious and clean and the staff are professional and friendly. The lobby and bar areas provide a pleasant environment to relax or catch up with friends. Décor very pleasant and is a perfect spot for a visit to Dublin theatres and restaurants.,4,2013,11,07
213,Disapointing Trip To Herbert Park,"I recently visited the Herbert Park for a weekend away with my mother. I was very much looking forward to our stay having lived near the hotel previously. The rooms were nicely decorated, the breakfast was lovely. My disappointment in the hotel was in that they placed us in a room which they knew was located near the hotels plant area for all the air conditioning etc. At 11:20pm at night the noise was still extremely loud. We ended up having to move room at 11:30pm. I was also disappointed with some of the front of house employee’s attitude. They were unfriendly and rude. The cleaning staff and the porter were all friendly and welcoming but it was very disappointing to find that the person who initially ""welcomes"" you to the hotel was so unfriendly. Certainly not what you would expect of a ""4"" star hotel. Overall the hotel's location and amenities were fine and I would consider visiting the hotel again.",3,2013,11,06
213,Solid four star hotel,"The hotel equivalent of the classic black cocktail dress: elegant and uncomplicated. Lacks any major character and will quickly fade from memory but does exactly what it says on the tin. Rooms nice, service good and food consistent. Trustworthy.",4,2013,11,05
213,Worst customer service ever - avoid,My wife and I stayed at the hotel on Saturday 2nd November on order to attend a works function at the Aviva Stadium. The company covered all B&B and car parking through the company CC leaving any accessorial to be settled by myself. After an average meal in the bar (amounting to €26) was signed for we were then harassed with phone calls to pay for the meal and 30 minutes later a knock at our hotel room door whereupon the duty manager presented us with a credit card terminal so as we could settle the bill....I have travelled for many years and have never ever been put in such an embarrassing situation or treated with so little trust. Complaints to the manager that evening (same person who arrived at our door) were poorly dealt with. Do not stay at this hotel...staff are poorly trained in customer service and had no regard to my wife and I or the complaint that was made by us.  Avoid or be disappointed. ,1,2013,11,05
213,Frequent Business Traveller,Have generally used the Herbert Park when staying in Dublin city centre and have always had a good nights sleep.The staff are always very accommodating and pleasent and the rooms are clean and tidy with comfortable beds.,5,2013,11,05
213,Herbert Park Hotel,"Arrived in Dublin for the weekend, and the staff etc at reception could not have been friendlier and helpful, especially for a first time visitor to Dublin. Standard room for the price these days, clean, spacious, and a very comfortable bed. Bar food was excellent, and very courteous service.
Next trip to Dublin- accommodation sorted!",4,2013,11,04
213,Very pleased with overall experience,"Stayed here overnight on a Saturday. Special offer: upgrade,free parking,prosecho and canapes. Felt it was very good value.  Good bright spacious room. Found staff to be very friendly and attentive.Breakfast had a good range on offer. Ballsbridge area has lots of good bars and restaurants so you have a choice. I'd stay again.",4,2013,11,03
213,"Clean, big room near Royal Dublin Society","Very clean and spacious room, with a modern flat screen TV. The room looked a little tired (chipped paint on the wall, scuff mark on the skirting board) and there isn't a kettle nor hair dryer in the room. The location is very convenient for attending events at the Royal Dublin Society and resides in a very nice neighbourhood of Dublin.",4,2013,11,03
213,If it weren't for the RDS this hotel wouldn't compete,"I stayed one night to attend an event in the RDS. The room was very comfortable but I left feeling ripped off and hard done by. It's the little things............... The price of breakfast, the fact that there are no tea/coffee making facilities in the room and the price of room service for a cuppa (pot of coffee €4.70 per person). We had one hand towel between 2 people and one tiny bottle of shampoo between us - a genuine mistake or a cost-cutting measure? When I booked online I asked for a room high up but was assigned a room on the ground floor with a boiler/air conditioning unit directly outside. 
We had breakfast in Roly's around the corner. The hot chocolate my daughter had was amazing. The coffee too. And it didn't cost €15.50 to €19.50 per person. I would not recommend this hotel. There is another one offering a lot more for a lot less and is more homely and within walking distance of the RDS, too..",3,2013,11,02
213,Good location,"We stayed in this hotel overnight when we were waiting for an early ferry crossing, the staff were all friendly, check in and out very smooth, and the room was clean and quiet. Downside was the price of drinks in the bar, and the fact that we were charged for overnight parking....surely as guests this ought to be free. A nice addition would be tea/coffee in the room. We would stay again",4,2013,11,01
213,Great location if going to RDS or sports stadiums,"We were going to an exhibition at the RDS which was about a block away. It is also close to Donnybrook  Leinster rugby- they were playing and we had a number of the attendees at the hotel. Also not far from bus line on Pembroke Road. It was convenient to have a pharmacy, a shop and several restaurants within walking distance. There is also a beautiful park adjacent to the hotel- nice for walking and enjoying nature. About 20 minutes by car from Stephens Green area.

Check-in and check out was smooth. We asked for a twin/ double and received room with 2 twins together.  We also were given a handicapped room. We didn't need a handicapped room, but it gave us a bigger bedroom and bathroom.  The room was very quiet despite being in the city. Price of breakfast was a high -€20 for  hot breakfast. (€15 for  a continental breakfast  that included meat and cheese) Next day, I bought Danish at a nearby shop and just ordered tea for €5.

Wi-fi was free and fast and worked everywhere. Also had gadget that you could plug in and charge electronics that use USB ports- save on the adapters. 

If I were going to another exhibition at the RDS or going to nearby stadiums, I would come back",4,2013,10,24
213,Disappointing Stay at the Herbert Park Hotel,"We (my husband and I) chose the hotel because it is close to the RDS and to a relative for a birthday party. On checking in I was asked for my credit card, but I only had a debit card. From then on we were treated like second class guests. Also everything was charged. The underground car park is €10 per night, breakfast between €12 and €20. Our room smelled of smoke and although we stayed 2 nights, the shower gel wasn't replaced. We also missed the kettle with tea and coffee. No swimming pool.
The only good thing was the location. Unfortunately I can't really recommend it.",2,2013,10,24
213,Great Experience in Dublin,"The hotel is in Dublin 4, the most prestigious part of Dublin. It is located beside the RDS which is used for exhibitions, concerts and is the home ground for Leinster Rugby.
We arrived at the hotel at 9.15 am and were checked into our room which was quite spacious.
The staff were all very friendly and had clearly been trained to ensure that guests were happy at all times - if they could accommodate your wishes, they did.

We were able to take a bus from outside the hotel staight to O'Connell Street. As a piece of advice, if you are going to visit Trinity College, get off the bus at the stop immediately before Trinity - the next stop was the one at which we got off - about half a mile beyond it. But that's down to Dublin Bus and not the Herbert Park Hotel.

The breakfast was plentiful and varied.

The only downside was that our bed was ""continental"" in style - two singlle bed matresses with single duvets

The Herbert Park is located beside the hotel. It has 32 acres which is delightful to walk around.

This will be our first choice hotel for Dublin for future visits",5,2013,10,23
213,Good hotel,"Was in Dublin on business and this hotel was a very good choice. I would recommend it to anyone. Location was not very close to the center, but there were at least two bus lines nearby. It is located near the U.S. Embassy.",4,2013,10,18
213,Herbert Park Hotel,"A groom of 6 ladies stayed in The Herbert Park Hotel recently and we had a very positive relaxing time. The staff were really friendly , helpful and professional. Reservations were super efficient. Rooms are very clean and comfortable, great beds. The hotel was busy but we had a noise free night and no disturbances along  corridors. Great choice at breakfast. We would definitely stay here again.",4,2013,10,17
213,A lovely place to stay,"Stayed on their overnight indulgence pack as we were up for a concert. Parking and breakfast in bed as well as canapes and champers on arrival were included and were a lovely touch.The hotel is beautiful, the breakfast is great and the staff are welcoming and friendly . We will definitely stay there again and would recommend very highly.",4,2013,10,16
213,A Great Place To Stay,"Stayed at Herbert Park Hotel on the eve of All Ireland Hurling Replay,Great Location,Great Breakfast,Parking included in the rate,Friendly and helpful staff and the nearby Herbert Park is well worth a look. While there is no Tea/Coffee making facilities in the rooms for a small extra charge room service tea ,biscuits etc is top notch and was delivered very promptly. Good value and would highly recommend this hotel",5,2013,10,09
213,Out of towners & pretty happy with everything,"We are from up country (Sligo) and don't get to Dublin very often.  We were visiting the furniture fair at the RDS and the position of the hotel is the perfect location. The staff were all very friendly and seem to work long hours. The lady that checked us in at 9pm was also the lady that checked us out at 9:30am.  Same went for the waiting staff in the restaurant in the evening and for breakfast!  The rooms were spotless, spacious and well appointed.  The mattresses were King Koil Club Class, which are a super mattress and we all had a good nights kip.  As I say being out of towners the prices for the evening meal and pints were not our usual country prices.......but this is the one and only gripe.  Would definitely return and stay in the hotel again without question.",4,2013,10,09
213,Simply the best!,"Been staying here on seven previous visits to Dublin over the past 16 years mainly for the GAA semi finals at Croke Park, every time has always been top class service and great memories a added bonus is looking out over the beautiful park, even though my Daughter is grown up now she still remembers all the wonderful nights and days spent at Herbert Park Hotel, the only place to be.",5,2013,10,08
213,tranquility serenity but close enough by bus to bustle,"We found the room to be large and  comfortable. It was ready for us when we arrived , we had requested an early check-in.The staff was  professional and helpful. We would definitely return.  Good restaurants very close by.",4,2013,10,07
213,Top Class Stay,"From the moment we stepped inside the hotel we felt pampered. We arrived at 10.00 a.m. and were checked in straight away into our room. All the staff we met were very friendly and efficient.
The rooms are large, with very comfortable beds and good hot water in shower. 
The only downside is there is no Tea/Coffee making facilities available in the rooms.
The breakfast had a great selection of fresh and cooked foods.  
I would highly recommend this hotel for whatever your reason in Dublin. It will only enhance your stay.",5,2013,10,02
213,A good experience,"The reservation was made by a partner, mainly due to position close to their office. What I saw exceeded my expectations. A good hotel in quite nice surroundings, just near Herbert Park. The room was large and with everything for a class hotel. My room was overlooking the park and I could sleep well after a long trip.
The breakfast was also at a good standard. Not far from the hotel you may find good restaurants. We dinned at Rolys Bistro, a real good place.
The service was not bad, but may improve. A receptionist with the name plate Ali was prompt to give me the key, but look at me with such a neutral look, he could have been replaced by a machine! As machine faults are frequent, he gave me a key card badly recorded, and I have to come down to have it re-recorded. To my surprise, he expected that, as without interrupting his phone call he set quickly the card.
At checkout with a different person everything went to normal.",4,2013,09,30
213,Good value for the best address in Dublin,"Clean, comfortable, professional staff in busy Ballsbridge. Enjoyed my stay as always and will return. Forgot my wedding band in the safe and several staff helped make sure I got it back!

Breakfast is good, and the lounge is okay for food in the evenings

",4,2013,09,28
213,One of our favourite Dublin Hotels,"We stay in Dublin a lot for business and this hotel is perfect for this.  On-site secure parking, bedrooms are really spacious and a nice relaxed area to get a drink after a busy day in the bar area downstairs.  Rates are really reasonable through the hotel.com site but also on the hotel site itself - they have really good special offers - which we discovered.  We were able to get breakfast and a bottle of prosecco included going through the hotel website for the same price of the room only price on a third party site.  Great value, which doesn't compromise on quality.",5,2013,09,28
213,Not really that impressed,"I had high hope for this hotel.  It looked nice from the website.

Arrived and check in was poor.  No mention of how to get on wifi, no mention of how to get to rooms, no mention of whether breakfast was included etc.  Not a great start.

Room was ok.  The pillows weren't soft enough for my liking.

The staff in the bar were great.  A young guy in his mid 20s was really attentive which was good.  The food was nice.

I wanted a late check out the next morning.  Check out is at 12pm.  I had a meeting in the hotel until 1pm so wanted to nip back to my room and freshen up.  I requested a check out at around 1.15pm.  Not possible.  They would give me 12.45pm.  Sorry, my meeting finishes at 1pm.  They wouldn't give the 30 minutes extra.  I'm sure the housekeeper could have found another room to clean in those 30 minutes.

Overall, not impressed.  I won't be staying here again in the future.  If you want a great hotel in Dublin, don't go here!",2,2013,09,28
213,Not living up to its reputation,"My parents stay at this hotel basically every time they go to Dublin which is quite often. I booked it on their recommendation even under the pretence that it is a good 20-30 minute walk to the city centre. The hotel is, as always, lovely. However on arrival our receptionist was a bit too formal and very dismissive. Admittedly me and my cousin arrived on a Monday morning being young and full of excitement however, we both work in hospitality and felt a certain cold shoulder about the introduction. It was very business-like and not at all what I would expect of a member of a reception staff at a 4* hotel. His interest in us was minimal and at times I had to get him to repeat things as he mumbled our room number for example and never made eye contact, looking at the counter or computer.

We had canapes and prosecco included in a deal we had and went down around 6pm to get these before we went to dinner reservations at 7:30. We were still waiting on them at 7:00 and asked someone to check as we noticed the girl who was serving us had disappeared. A change of shift and a simple mistake. The staff were lovely and apologised but it seemed a little mismanaged maybe due to a lack of supervisor or manager on the lobby bar floor?

We came back after dinner and had drinks in the lobby and also did this on the second night. However the bar stopped serving cocktails at 10pm as the manager was going off duty (where was the barman, its a hotel so what about residents?) we just got our order in for two cosmos before he left. I understand its not as busy mid week, however I would still expect the same level of service no matter when I stayed!

Finally on check out, we went down to hand the keys back as we paid in full on arrival. Again we were greeted with a very cold reception from a different member of staff this time. She seemed again disinterested and businesslike, and we were not asked if we enjoyed our stay or if everything was ok. It seemed like they had their money and therefore didn't care about the quality of service. Bored of customers maybe? 

Being 21 & 20 we may not seem as if we care about these things because we are ""young and carefree"" but we do. Coming from a hospitality background does that to you! You become your own worst enemy. 

Overall I would say the hotel is lovely and so is the area with local amenities and lovely restaurants around but the general service was lacking and seemed very mismanaged and cold; particularly from the reception side of things. Not what I would expect at all especially visiting there regularly with my parents a few years back and thinking everyone and everything was lovely!

It seems very different now and I think it has changed management. Possibly the reason behind its downfall in customer satisfaction!",3,2013,09,24
213,Herbert Park Hotel,"This was more like a large city hotel than a country inn.  The staff was efficient and friendly, though somewhat formal compared to the other Irish hotels we stayed in at smaller towns.

The hotel is convenient to public transportation as well as a selection of restaurants.

Our room was well appointed and comfortable.",4,2013,09,23
213,Stylish,"Very nice and stylish hotel. A bit overpriced but if you wish to stay in posh place, you came to the right hotel. Close to AVIVA Stadium or Shwogrounds - perfect location for those attanding rugby match or a trade show. Excelent food, poor service.",3,2013,09,23
213,Paper walls,"On a business trip I stayed at Herberts park. The taxi left as at the side entrance, which I found a bit odd, although we could find the front desk easily. I went jogging in Herberts park which was absolutely fantastic after a long day first in an airplane and then at the office. The room service fish and chips I had later was pretty bland - but the service at least was fast. The room itself was clean, comfy and spacious. The issue I have with the room is the thin walls. During my stay I had several phone conferences and so did the gentleman next door. I could clearly hear every word he spoke and I bet he heard mine. And we were not talking loud. The breakfast was the usual - nothing to complain about nothing to rave about. Funny thing is that you are charged extra in case you want a cappuccino instead of black coffee. The breakfast is pretty pricey and asking extra for a cappuccino sounds a bit... desperate?",4,2013,09,22
213,Quiet and relaxing,"We are just back from spending a very relaxing and enjoyable night in the Herbert Park. The hotel is an oasis in Dublin with excellent rooms, an efficient staff and superb breakfast. We have already booked our next visit.

Martin Donaldson",5,2013,09,22
213,Nice hotel for relaxing stay,"Was attending a wedding in Dublin and chose to stay at Herbert Park. What a surprise! Beautiful hotel with open plan lobby, great food, pleasant staff. On arrival my room wasn't ready, but I desperately had to change so very friendly Spanish receptionist called the manager to enquire about my options. I was offered to use gym changing facilities, which worked out perfect. 
Breakfast in the morning was a bit busy, but my omelette was very tasty, so I didn't mind the wait. Wish I had time for a stroll in the park, but maybe on my next visit.",5,2013,09,20
213,"Nice, quiet and realxing","Close enough to get out and about yet felt like a sleepy suburb at weekends.  Stayed here whilst on business for a week and was nice place to return to after long days.  No pushy people, space was given yet always seemed to have someone about when you needed.  staff all very courteous and friendly which sometimes goes amiss in a big hotel",5,2013,09,20
213,Great business hotel,"It was my first stay at The Herbert Park Hotel and certainly not the last as I do travel to Dublin quite often. Rooms are very clean, beds comfortable, warm and welcoming front desk staff. 
Had a quick dinner in their lobby bar and found the food excellent, reasonably priced with very wide choice. Hotel has plenty secure underground car parking. 
I had difficulty connecting to free wifi, after I called reception it was immediately resolved. Later tall lady at reception was kind and printed my boarding pass for me and delivered to my room.",5,2013,09,17
213,Perfect each time!,"This time I've travelled with my mum and during the first night we didn't get much sleep as we were on the floor with a big group and they were rather noisy! In the morning Reception Manager approached us at the breakfast to check how was our stay and the minute we mentioned our problem she offered to move our room to a quite part of the hotel. 
I love staying there. It's exceptionally clean, great location, many nice restaurants within walking distance and the park is really beautiful. 
We had a fantastic stay and that's all thanks to always attentive reception team. Would highly recommend and hope to be back soon!",5,2013,09,17
213,Couples Weekend Break,"The Location is great but unfortunately some of the staff were so rude - I did not realise that bar staff waiting tables are allowed to chew gum?  The front desk lady was also very abrupt and did not have a nice manner.  We did not find the bed or the pillows comfortable - 2 single beds were pushed together and at reception we were told we had been allocated a king-size bed.
I would expect a higher standard from this hotel as I am sure it is popular due to its location.",3,2013,09,17
213,Weekend Break,"Herbert Park Hotel is a really modern yet comfortable hotel in a fantastic location, being just a 20 minute walk from the city centre, a perfect way to see Dublin. Bedrooms were immaculate and spacious and the bed was really comfortable, my only issue was the air conditioning was quite noisy, making it difficult to sleep being a light sleeper. Breakfast was a really positive experience with plenty of choice and service was very attentive and friendly. My main issue however was with reception-our receptionist was blonde and really unfriendly, I found her manner to be quite rude and off putting. It's unfortunate that the hotel's front of house marred an otherwise positive experience.",4,2013,09,16
213,worst hotel we stayed in in Ireland,"Our stay in this hotel was spoiled by the staff, who were very unfriendly and rude. This was in sharp contrast to the welcoming hospitality we got in every other hotel we stayed in during our holiday in Ireland. We actually checked out early and went elsewhere. Breakfast was poor.",2,2013,09,16
213,Nice hotel,"A nice hotel in Dublin4. Plenty of nice restaurants nearby if you want but the restauarnt was very good.

The rooms are clean and the beds comfortable.

My receptionist was not blonde, he was black haired and very helpful and pleasant.

I will definately stay there again when I am in Dublin.",5,2013,09,13
213,Great setting in the city,"Herbert Park Hotel is in a lovely setting bordered by the park itself. You could easily forget you were in the city. 
Bedrooms are spacious and very well maintained. Breakfast is generous with lots of options. The secure parking is a bonus and proximity to the RDS makes it a very good option if attending an event. Some good special offers available.  Staff very friendly and helpful. To be recommended!",5,2013,09,12
213,Very nice hotel despite the receptionist,"The hotel is set a beautiful park, the rooms are nice, clean and modern, you get free WiFi, water and chocolates, the bed is very comfortable. The hotel receptionist (blonde) wasn't very nice, she never smiled and wasn't welcoming - if I was to go on first impressions - shes not a good one. Other staff we came across were nice.  Breakfast isn't included in the room rate and its expensive at 20 euro's each, so we never tried it. I would stay again if the price was right, the location is nice with a lovely park on the door step. My husband tried the gym, a big disappointment, very little equipment and very old which is surprising since the hotel is 4* and the rooms so nice.",5,2013,09,11
213,four stars hotel suitable for business stay,"I spent 1 night in this four star hotel located in Ballsbridge. Room was quite big and well furnished. bathromm was also big and well equipped. the king size bed was extremely confortable. breakfast was pretty ok, quite good choice; cappuccino is extra charge, not included into the 'standard' breakfast albeit this is quite common solution. All considered it is a good hotel for short periods of stay for people on business travel. However I couldn't find any particular areas of excellence that makes it superior.",4,2013,09,10
213,Good location for Dublin 4. Nice hotel.,"I stayed here on business. Kingsize rooms are good size. 
Good, powerful showers. Convenient for Ballsbridge and a short taxi ride into the city.
Very good selection of restaurants close by.
Food in the hotel is reasonable.
Reception staff are polite and helpful.",3,2013,09,10
213,Breakfast waiters,"I have stayed at the hotel twice recently, and while I find the hotel very comfortable and the general staff very helpful and friendly, both times I have had breakfast, I have found the breakfast waiters, particularly some of the female ones to be extremely rude and bad mannered. 

I wonder if they are college students working part time? I get the impression they feel working as waitresses is below them. One Irish blonde girl was particularly bad mannered and snooty.

I suggest Management review their recruitment policy and ensure all staff are given an induction to Hotel management.",3,2013,09,09
213,Great location for the Aviva,"Stayed with my sister and 13 year old daughter in a triple room. The room whilst not luxurious was immaculate and airy. Quite sparse hotel room with minimal furniture. Super location for the Aviva with a great selection of restaurants and pubs in the location (the latter not visited!). We had lunch in the hotel and my only complaint was not enough of a selection when it came to salads, sandwiches, etc. Breakfast was excellent but service was not focussed enough. Perhaps too many young staff on the morning we breakfasted. No milk, tea instead of coffee, wrong breakfast order, milk not refilled on cereal table and so on. At nearly 350 it was not good value for money for us but perhaps would be good value for 3 paying adults. ",3,2013,09,07
213,Smart business hotel,"This is a stylish reasonably priced business hotel.  The lobby is big, bright and modern and the rooms are nicely furnished and have good TVs, comfy beds and mini bars. Wifi is free and the location is smack bang in the centre of Ballsbridge, about 15 minutes from the south city centre by foot. Probably not as good for families, but would work for couples or short stays. ",5,2013,09,06
213,Brilliant hotel,"We stayed at The Herbert Park Hotel with another couple for a weekend in Dublin recently
Although a little way out of the city centre this hotel was really good
We had a rate for the Friday night which inc breakfast and a bottle of good Prosecco of 109:00 Euro`s 
The rooms are spacious and very well decorated and spotlessly clean
The breakfast could not be faulted,lots of choice and a vast array of really good fresh fruit
We had dinner in the restaurant on the Saturday night and it was delicious and good value for money
The staff were excellent throughout
Would highly recommend this hotel and would stay here again",5,2013,09,05
213,"nice hotel , pleasant staff","very nice hotel. location ok not in the city centre but clodse by.. rooms are ok, clean and spacious. the staff is very helpfull and friendly. breakfast is super!  recommended for a city trip or business.  free fast wifi. 
",4,2013,09,05
213,Excellent lovely hotel very friendly service,Lovely hotel in a nice location. Rooms are spacious nicely decorated and very clean. Breakfast was excellent. The foyer is a lovely relaxing space perfect for a drink before heading out for the evening ,5,2013,09,01
213,Excellent Hotel and Great Deal,"My wife and I had a great weekend stay here and it cost only €109 per night.  This included room, breakfast and a bottle of Prosecco each night. The deal was fantastic as hotels in the same area cost more without the breakfast.  The food was lovely and the staff were very friendly, the hotel was definitely 4 star and it was easy to get to by public transport. The bus goes to either Dublin City Centre and to Dunleary.

There is a park at the rear of the hotel which is nice to walk around on a sunny day.  Their is a bus service to the 02 Arena and takes you back to the hotel.  There are a couple of nice bars but the Horse Show House pub was a gen of a find and is only 2 minutes walk away. http://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/Restaurant_Review-g186605-d2631723-Reviews-Horse_Show_House-Dublin_County_Dublin.html

When I go back to Dublin, I will stay here again.",5,2013,08,29
213,Not great value,"Overpriced rooms,food &  drink Gym in the basement no windows 3 items of equipment.  Inconsistent service due to inadequate numbers of staff. Single rooms nowhere to work or eat except on the bed. Good location and comfortable bed. ",3,2013,08,29
213,I Really Have No Complaints,"I recently stayed here the first two nights of a tour, and I found it to be perfect for the situation.  Out of four places we stayed, the beds were the most comfortable, and the breakfast in the morning was the best.  It isn't a luxurious place, but it is clean, well located, and has a friendly, accommodating staff.  The bar and the restaurant are also nice. My room was much larger than I expected since I was traveling alone.  There were shops and restaurants within easy walking distance, and it was in a lovely location surrounded by a beautiful park.  If I ever get back to Dublin, I would stay here again.",4,2013,08,27
213,Dont know how it's a four star,"Stayed here 1 night with 2 kids and infant. The hotel is in a great location in ballsbridge right beside Herbert park great for kids there are plenty of restaurants in the village. Our disappointment started when we arrived to a not so warm reception, the hotel seemed to lack atmosphere of a ""fully booked vibrant hotel!"" We wer advised breakfast wasn't included and we didnt have a family offer i said i wasnt offered a family offer receptionist replied i dont know wer u booked i replied directly with the hotel none left was the reply. First hotel in a long time wer we felt let down at checking in. We wer not prepared to pay clossil money for all that kids have for breakfast €15-19 each. Such a pity to have to leave the hotel  for food especially with 3 kids. no tea/coffee making facilities in room of course it was extra I had to avail of that as I was gasping. When it's 4 star an u pay dear for 2 rooms might i add, u expect the simple things like that to be there. rooms wer clean an large nothing to exciting on a whole there are so many hotels in Dublin to get value for your money this isn't one of these hotels granted this was a very busy wknd in Dublin we have stayed in other hotels in dublin at this time in city centre locations and 4 star and never had to pay extra for anything. We can't help feeling as much money as possible was trying to be made. Unfortunately we wouldn't recommend this hotel for value for money (family) but it is a lovely hotel clean and great location details like i stated above could be so easily rectified and make this such an inviting hotel for families. I asked for a kettle to sterilise the babies bottles an no problem it was there. 

 ",3,2013,08,26
213,Lovely setting in great location,"My husband and I recently stayed at the Herbert Park and it was very enjoyable. The hotel foyer and bar area is light and airy. The rooms are comfortable and well appointed. The bathroom is a little small, but other than a very pleasant place to stay. The breakfast was excellent with plenty of healthy choices. I was also able to order freshly made porridge which was really good. The location of the hotel is great, beside the park and close to the city centre also. It is also great to have secure underground parking.",4,2013,08,24
213,Spacious comfortable hotel,"Booked a three night stay in Dublin at this hotel. First impressions was modern and spacious with a huge reception area, the rooms are not quite as big as you would expect but are clean and comfortable. The staff are most welcoming, and pleasant. Although its outside the city centre this was and ideal location for my stay in Dublin.",4,2013,08,23
213,"Great value, good quality, close to the city centre","We booked this hotel on Last Minute and got a great deal called Fabulous Friday which included a free bottle of prosecco. The first room we got smelt of smoke but they changed the room straight away with no issue. We were meeting family and friends close to Grafton Street and it's only a short taxi ride away, although you could walk it in about 25 minutes. Service was good and the standard of rooms and breakfast was very good. Parking is free and secure. It's a nice quiet area so you won't be kept awake with the noise of Dublin night life! I will definitely use the hotel again.",4,2013,08,22
213,Very pleased,"A bright, clean and modern hotel. Staff were busy but always friendly. The room service breakfast was larger than expected and very good.

Parking in the limited underground carpark was precarious due to the sloppy parking of some cars.",5,2013,08,20
213,Cold hotel no personality,"Stayed here for one night and have to say I would not be rushing back.

On check in to the hotel were presented with our registration card to sign and noticed straight away that the address used for me was an English one – strange as I never lived there.  I pointed it out to the guy and reception and he said just cross it out and put in mind, most likely just another guest with the same name – not good as when booked I gave my address.

The room was nice but no tea or coffee in the room and you had to pay €3.50 to have it – come on that’s a joke.

The bar man on that night was very nice and friendly the only plus in the hotel.  On checking out the lady on reception took a call never said excuse me or asked the person to hold just went to check us out and stayed talking on the phone.  No manners 

All in all the staff were rude and will not  be back",2,2013,08,20
213,fantastic experience,"Recently stayed here on my way and way back home due to early morning flight at Dublin airport. I really enjoyed my stay. The location is fantastic, Ballsbridge is a great area and I highly recommend Roly's. Back to the hotel. Great location right beside the lovely Herbert Park. The room on the way back I preferred because it looked onto the court yard whereas on the way only looked onto the back of the hotel. So try to get one of the front facing rooms. The rooms themselves are lovely: very spacious, bright, clean and modern. The bathrooms are fantastic. Didnt hear any noise at night which is a huge bonus for me. Wifi is now available all throughout the hotel. I see a lot of people with the tea making facilities-or lack of. It must be my time out of the country but this really didnt bother me. We paid 3.50 for a tea and coffee to be delivered to our room. I thought this was very good value (maybe the hotel could throw in a few extra biscuits) and personally Id prefer to pay for a fresh cup than to make it with milk that has been lying around all day. Although I see Im in the minority in this but at 109euros the night I dont see the big deal. The only reason the hotel gets 4 stars instead of 5 is the breakfast. The breakfast room itself is lovely and the buffet of toast, cereals etc is perfect but I hate hotels obsession (and its not the only one) of having the hot breakfast buffet style. An Irish fry just isnt the same in the heated plates. Id prefer to eat less and have it made fresh for me.However, I see this isnt the norm in Ireland at the moment which is a pity. This is the only negative thing about an excellent stay.",4,2013,08,20
213,BEST HOTEL IN DUBLIN BAR NONE,"Stayed at the Herbert Park Hotel to celebrate our wedding anniversary.We stay at this hotel on any trip to Dublin and it is a First Class Establishment!
From the minute you arrive you are subjected to the upper most standards of courtesy and service.The location of the hotel could not be better, in the Ballsbridge area.We have been staying here for years now having followed a friends recommendation,and have never looked back.
For this most recent stay we booked the indulgence package.On arrival we found we had been upgraded to a fantastic 5th floor room(we have stayed on most floors and non will disappoint).
The finite touches such as tea/coffee on arrival,the prossecco and the attention and attitude of staff would make us recommend this hotel to anyone without fear of disappointment.
The food is first class,served in the lovely surroundings of the pavilion restaurant with the bar and foyer area a relaxing area to spend time.
Walk out your door and turn right(20metres) into 40 odd acres of stunning parks,well maintained and complete with lakes and birds. Walk or jog and burn off some of those calories,ideal for kids with safe well maintained play areas etc.A good walk through the beautiful Ballsbridge and you are at St Stephens Green and all Dublin has to offer(the craics mighty).Aviva and RDS on your doorstep.
Have stayed in several hotels in Dublin over the years but having discovered this one years ago there is simply only one choice for us""The Herbert Park""",5,2013,08,18
213,Good for an overnight break with a group of friends,"The Herbert Park Hotel proved to be a good venue for an overnight reunion of a small group of ladies. The Fabulous Friday package was good value. We had dinner that night... Siva, our waiter for the night, was friendly, good-humoured and efficient. Lovely to have Herbert Park on the doorstep for a stroll the following morning. ",4,2013,08,18
213,Excellent hotel,"Lovely location near the RDS ,nice rooms very good service with suburb staff . Great location for the horse show as it is in the heart of it all but nice and quiet.......the best of both worlds. Tea and coffee making facilities in the room would be a BIG plus.",5,2013,08,14
213,Continues to exceed expectations!,"Stayed here for the past 10 years during the Dublin Horse Show and continues to deliver in terms of hospitality and accommodation. Rooms exceptionally well maintained, spacious public areas with a contemporary feel and a front desk team who always go that extra mile to make your stay so memorable.  Keep it up, we'll be back next year if not sonner.",5,2013,08,13
213,disappointing,promises of luxury & style were a serious let down over priced no kettle in room everything about this hotel was bland except the demand for money 5 euro for a coffee lacking in vibe & atmosphere geared towards business men service was less than friendly,3,2013,08,11
213,Great Hotel; Great Location,"This hotel has everything that I could want.in a business hotel. 

The rooms are excellently equipped and spacious with proper work area, large comfortable bed and super fast wifi all over the hotel. There is a well stocked minibar with a good selection and the air conditioning is good although you can open the window if you prefer.

The lobby/bar/restaurant area is great with lots of space to sit and the breakfast is excellent. The service is super and very quick.

The hotel is conveniently located next to Herbert Park if you want to take a walk and also to a small business areas with a selection of pubs and restaurants.

All told I could not fault this hotel.",5,2013,08,08
213,Overnight Indulgence Package,"Myself and my boyfriend stayed here on the 3rd of August. This was our first stay at hotel and we were impressed. I booked the Overnight Indulgence package and it was well worth it, its excellent value compared to the standard room rate considering it includes parking and a glass of prosecco and canapés on arrival, the option of having breakfast in bed until 12 noon, your choice of paper delivered to your room in the morning and late check out at 2pm. Check in was quick and easy once I realised the couple I was waiting behind weren't queuing to check in... Our room (505) was very nice with a jacuzzi bath and his and her sinks in the huge bathroom. The bed was comfortable and the room was clean and the air conditioning was very useful. I was a little disappointed we couldn't get out onto what looked like a balcony. Maybe there was a knack to the window/door that I just didn't get.  We were a little disappointed with the breakfast. There were plenty on continental options but I was shocked that considering the Herbert Park is a 4 star hotel they had a buffet for the hot food. The sausage was of poor quality and the rashers were dried out as if the had been sitting out a while. I was a little confused as to why there was a menu on the table if the breakfast wasn't made to order, and nobody indicated to us that breakfast was self service. Check out again was quick and easy. Overall we enjoyed our stay and might be back again.",4,2013,08,05
213,Great hotel and now free wi-fi,"We use this hotel quite a lot for it's convenient location, nice rooms and professional staff . Now at last they have free wi-fi so I feel that, perhaps, they have listened to guest feedback and seen the light. For a visitor to Ireland, a local heading to Dublin for a shopping or event trip or someone having a weekend break this hotel is fantastic. A short trip by bus from the city centre it is an oasis of calm amid the hurly burly of the city with the Herbert Park just outside. It is central to many restaurants and is in a very safe and secure area. Their specials of €109 per couple for B&B, free parking and a bottle of Prosecco in your room is a bargain at the weekends. Lovely airy reception lobby area and great staff.",4,2013,08,05
213,Another excellent stay at the Herbert Park,"My husband and I stayed at the Herbert Park along with my parents on 11th July 2013 for 1 night.  This was our second stay at hotel in 6 months and we were even more impressed with the hotel second time around.  

Both times we have stayed at the hotel we have booked the Overnight Indulgence package and it is worth every penny, in fact it is excellent value compared to the standard room rate.  The free car parking and prosecco and canapes are lovely touches on arrival not to mention the option of having breakfast in bed until 12noon and late check out at 2pm. 

Check in was quick and easy and a much nicer experience than our first visit and this was due to the very friendly Hungarian gentleman who checked us in and advised us we had been upgraded to exectutive rooms on the fifth floor which was a lovely touch.  On our first visit to the hotel back in March we found the man at check in very rude and told the hotel so on our comment card.  It seems that they have now upped their game as far as a fast and friendly check in are concerned.

Our room (507) was very nice with a jacuzzi bath and his and her sinks in the huge bathroom.  The bed was huge and comfortable and the room was clean and of a comfortable temperature.  

As we arrived in the early evening we freshened up and made our way down to the Terrace Lounge were we were given our delicious canapes (smoked salmon on rye bread, prawn tempura, olive & mozzarella sticks and pate on bread) and as we were a group of 4 all on the indulgence package the helpful waiter advised us for an extra 1 euro we could have a bottle of prosecco rather than 4 individual glasses which was nice as we each got a little extra prosecco this way.  The waiters that served us were all very helpful and friendly and recommended restaurants in the local area.  We decided to stay local for a meal and went to Al Boschetto Italian restaurant across the road from the hotel and this was very nice and not too pricy.  We then finished off our night back at the Terrace Lounge in the hotel before having a very comfortable and good night's sleep.

We pre-ordered our breakfast to be delivered to our room at a time that suited us and the full Irish breakfast was delicious and came with plenty of accompaniments, delicious.

Check out again was quick and easy and we will definitely be back to the Herbert Park Hotel in the near future.",5,2013,07,30
213,Excellent Stay,"I've now stayed at the Herbert Park Hotel on 3 different occasions while visiting Dublin.
Each time I've had a pleasant stay.  Nice accommodations, full breakfast with many options, and a courteous, helpful staff.
Much of the hotel and restaurant overlook Herbert Park, a gem in itself in a great city and a place to  enjoy a quiet walk early in the morning or evening.
City Centre is just a 20 minute walk or a short bus ride (#'s 4 or 7).
This will be my ""go to"" hotel for all future visits to the city",5,2013,07,29
213,Amazing hotel in fantastic location,I traveled to Dublin this month and had the most enjoyable stay in this hotel. The location was fantastic and had a great view over Herbert Park - an absolute gem within the city. The staff could not have been more friendly and helpful. I usually avoid dining in hotel restaurants but highly recommend the afternoon tea and lunch served here. Would certainly stay here again.,5,2013,07,26
213,really enjoyed our stay,Brilliant place to stay for the RDS. rooms are clean and pleasant. Would definitely stay here again and would not hesitate to recommend to others. The breakfast was enjoyable and also good value. We really enjoyed dublin too. Was so much fun to visit the wonderful city.,4,2013,07,21
213,Buisness / Holiday,"Very nice and clean hotel. Very accessable for Dublin and local restaurants and pubs etc (Aviva Stadium only 10 minute walk away). Only downside was as a returning visitor (twice) there was no record of me having stayed before. So when I asked for a specific room I was told that it would be noted against my name for my next visit ! Hmm.   The direct Airport bus (6 Euro fare) drops off and picks up across the road - but hotel, does not advertise this fact ?",4,2013,07,16
213,Nice hotel in great location.,"Nice hotel & I love the location. Got upgraded to an Executive room so ""happy out"". Stayed on their Friday night package for two including breakfast, bottle of bubbly & parking for €109 so pretty ok deal. €6.50 tray premium to have breakfast in bed is a bit high considering the obligatory tip when delivered. Service was slow in the lobby and that was afternoon before it got busy so once you are not in a hurry, you should be fine. Food quality is good.  Will definitely return & would certainly recommend.   ",4,2013,07,14
213,"Nice, clean, modern hotel with good food but no free WiFi","I stayed here for one night on a business trip, so the Hotel was chosen partly based on the location. First impressions were of a nice, modern hotel. It is in a very nice part of Dublin with the American and other embassies nearby as well as the Aviva Stadium and it adjoins a large park area but it is a cab/bus/train ride into the centre of Dublin. There is a small grocery shop, coffee shop and pub just across the road from the hotel.

The room was large, spacious, spotlessly clean (as was the whole hotel in general) and had a huge, comfortable bed which seemed to be two singles pushed together although the join wasn't too noticeable. The only disappointment with the room was that it had no tea making facilities (although you could order this on a cheap(er) version of room service) and the TV was rubbish - it was an old CRT type TV and the picture was awful. The room had a mini-bar but, as with all mini-bars, this is best avoided due to the prices! The bathroom was, again, spotlessly clean with a very good shower and steady water temperature.

I had an excellent evening meal in the bar area and breakfast was a buffet type arrangement with a good variety and choice of items on offer. All the staff were very professional and helpful.

One thing I must mention, which is a pet hate of mine, is that WiFi is not free. I really find this unacceptable in a hotel like this, particularly when the room cost is on the expensive side in the first place.",4,2013,07,14
213,"Comfortable stay, not overwhelmed","I stayed at the Herbert Park in early July for two nights whilst on a short trip to Dublin.  I didn't spend much time at the hotel but it was a comfortable and pleasant enough stay.  On the plus side it's in a great location and we enjoyed our stroll around the area, admiring the Georgian architecture.  It's also an easy stroll (about 30 mins) to Grafton Street which we also enjoyed in the early evening sunshine.   Herbert Park itself is well worth an amble.  
We ate breakfast on our first morning.  It was nothing to write home about, but there was plenty of it, including fresh fruit.  Note if you want something freshly made you pay a substantial additional fee.  Staff were friendly, particularly in the lobby lounge.  
The place would benefit from a makeover, however.  Many of the rattan chairs in the lobby had rather unedifying holes in them.  Similarly in the bedroom, which was very clean, with a comfy bed, the furniture was somewhat battered and the wallpaper was peeling away in places.  
My main bugbear, however, is that the hotel is too stingy to include a tea and coffee station in its rooms.  That's one seriously mean decision that could be rectified pretty easily.  We had an early flight on our last morning which meant we couldn't have breakfast and I really didn't want to take out a mortgage for a cup of room service tea.  Then there's the wi-fi charge.......
Overall a nice enough place in a great location.   Beware of additional costs and pack a thermos if want a hot drink in your room.",3,2013,07,11
213,Herbert Park Hotel,"This is a great location for anyone going to games or concerts in the Aviva stadium. Rooms were very clean and comfortable. Service was excellent and when I had a query re lost property this was dealt with efficiently and promptly. 
      ",4,2013,07,02
213,Enjoyable Stay,"I stayed here last saturday with a friend to attend the Rod Stewart concert,like the previous post payed 275.00 for 1 night bed & breakfast. Check in was quick and efficient by a very pleasant guy on reception, the room was lovely very comfortable beds and powerful shower in the bathroom. Would have been nice to have tea/coffee making facilities in the room. We didn't eat in the hotel apart from breakfast sunday morning which was just ok definately not worth the 19.95 they charge if you were to pay seperately for it. Check out on sunday was again quick and efficient I would definately stay here again if I was attenting anything in the RDS it's an ideal location",4,2013,07,02
213,Overly priced,"Myself and my partner recently stayed in Herbert Park, we had no problems with the hotel other than being overpriced for what you get.
We arrived, greeted and checked in, very promptly. Room was spacious and comfortable.
We were attending a concert in RDS and was great location for this. We paid 275.00 for 1 night bed and breakfast, which I thought was a bit overpriced , we had no other choice as all other hotels were booked out.
If you want and are willingly to pay this for the hotel, then I would highly recommend it.
Breakfast was lovely, great choice but the hot food which is most popular didn't have much of a choice.",3,2013,07,01
213,Bar Food excellent,We had food yesterday in the bar prior to going to Rod Stewart concert. Excellent menu and lovely atmosphere. Staff very helpful and friendly. Drinks a bit overpriced €6.95 for a glass of wine. Would return again .,5,2013,06,30
213,Great Location,"We stayed here to attend a concert in the Aviva Stadium. The hotel is only 10 minutes walk to the stadium so it is perfect and would be ideal for attending a match too. There is a big carpark for guest parking and we didn't use our car for the whole weekend because Ballsbridge is very central, nice walk into town and plenty of buses and taxis. The DART train is also close by. In fact we spent most of out time in Ballsbridge and Donnybrook. Lots of shop and pubs and good places to eat. Herbert Park itself is large and nice for a walk. The hotel is big, but clean and comfortable. Rooms are well equipped. Ideal spot for a family stay.",4,2013,06,24
213,Pavilion Restaurant - very nice,"Good meal, reasonable price, super quality, will return again. Friendly staff. Nice ambiance. 33 euro for 3 courses.

Good meal, reasonable price, super quality, will return again. Friendly staff. Nice ambiance. 33 euro for 3 courses.",5,2013,06,23
213,Lovely,"Went to the pavilion restaurant with friends, for dinner we were given a lovely table by window. Staff were very attentive, and were very efficient. We ordered wine and we ordered from the dinner menu €33 for 3 courses, presentation of food was great and portions were very good. We all left the hotel full & we all were very pleased with our evening.
We will definitely return.well done to all the staff, keep up the good work.",4,2013,06,22
213,Never let's me down,"Stayed here once again on 21st June to go to Rihanna concert at Aviva Stadium.  When we checked in we were looked after so well by a very gorgeous receptionist who announced we had been upgraded to an executive room on the fifth (top) floor.  The room was great, with a fantastic en-suite and everything you need in a room. As with others I don't like paying €10 for the wi-fi.  
I have stayed at this hotel may times and it has never been disappointing.  If you are looking for a hotel in central(ish) Dublin, then it is well worth choosing.  The immediate area around Ballsbridge is nice including the pubs opposite which are excellent.",5,2013,06,22
213,Very good food,We didn't stay here but had a family lunch- they lost our booking but otherwise service was very good- charming waitress. I am not a fan of formal hotel lunches but the food was good - really nice soup and my son said he had the best steak ever. One of our party had a generous portion of salmon which was properly cooked. My fruit salad was OK- too much Granny Smith apple. Salad was nice though slightly uninspiring leaves. Good coffee. Overall good.,4,2013,06,16
213,A serene Hotel,We stayed in the Herbert Park Hotel last Friday night the 7th of July. It was a magnificent evening and we walked through the Herbert park located just beside the Hotel. I have always loved this hotel. It is serene. Parking is easy. The staff are helpful. The buffet the following morning is excellent. We then headed off to the Dublin Zoo which was amazing. Thank you to all,5,2013,06,11
213,Excellent,"Booked Late in the day on our way to Dublin. Our room was lovely very comfortable with everything one would expect in such a hotel. My husband had breakfast which is an excellent buffet and the view out on to the park on a sunny morning was amazing. The staff were friendly and efficient, rebooked for there and then for concert later in the month.",5,2013,06,08
213,Rugby Disappointing - Hotel Winning!,"We stayed at Herbert Park for the Rabo Direct Rugby Final which Ulster - our team - lost.
The hotel is directly next to the RDS where the game was played and it was a great location to be.
The atmosphere was excellent before and after the game and all supporters welcomed in a friendly manner.
Rooms are well fitted out and have the usual amenities expected of such an hotel. My wife described the breakfast buffet as the best she had seen for years - especially the outstanding fresh fruit which is often an Achilles Heel of Irish breakfast buffets. Only criticism is the parking fee for residents.",5,2013,05,31
213,Excellent stay,"I was in one of their exec suites 2 weeks ago - excellent size ,comfy mattress and pillows, well stocked mini bar and excellent room service. Stayed here because others closer to work were booked out. Great location. Great service. Reasonable rates.What more can you ask for ?",5,2013,05,29
213,Evening meal,We were at rugby final and kind of arrived at this hotel afterwards as it was nearby. We stayed for our tea. Service was excellent. staff are v efficient and friendly. Food was very nice. Good sized portions with prices probably in line with dublin prices. Salmon with potatoes and veg was 16.50 euro. Panini was 10 euros. We enjoyed our meal. I would go back again for food here,4,2013,05,28
213,Sunday. Celebration,We were looking for somewhere nice for a birthday lunch Had a lovely celebration at the Herbert Park Hotel which was recommended  by our brother who had been  there before  Great for a crowd.  Lovely buffet with great variety  Staff were so helpful and nice.   We had a table with a  view overlooking Herbert Park which was a bonus It was a really enjoyable relaxing afternoon,5,2013,05,27
213,Would not rate a 4*,"Positives: nice looking building from out side an on ground floor. Staff very pleasant. Delicious food from room service and breakfast. 

Negatives: rooms are standard decor is old, been in better 3 and 2*. No complementary tea or coffee you have to pay for it €4.20 per person for a pot. Food and drinks are well over priced and so is the mini bar in ur room you can get the same quality in a cheaper hotel near by. Wifi is €10 for 24hours but only one person can use the log in so we had to pay twice for my self and hubby to use net at the same time. You have to pay to park your car in the car park. 

Would not pay to stay here again when I can get the same if not better for cheaper, would rate the building and ground floor as 4* but rooms are more like a 2*  .",2,2013,05,25
213,Wifi Joke,What a joke that in this day and age a four star hotel charges for wifi. Complete and utter joke- especially since this hotel was used extensively during Ireland's Presidency of the EU. Management need to review this policy!!!,2,2013,05,22
213,Charges and Tea Making,I had occasion to stay in this hotel for 3 nights from May 7th to May 10th. While the staff were super and professional I cannot believe that the Hotel were charging €10 per day for Wifi access. This to me is the most basic of facilities. I could have charged this facility to my Company but on principle I decided not to avail of Wifi. Also there were not any tea making facilities in the room. Tea could be ordered through room service at a cost. I am on business in Dublin again from May 13th for 4 nights but I have moved to a Hotel that meets my needs including free Wifi and tea making facilities. Just thought people should know that this hotel charges for what many would consider basic facilities.,4,2013,05,12
213,Very Good Hotel,"Stayed on Friday night, 10/5/13 on a special Friday deal. 109 euros for 2 with breakfast & a bottle of prossecco included along with free car parking  
Hotel has excellent location beside Herbert Park & a stones throw from the bustle of Ballsbridge & right beside the RDS.
Rooms bright, airy & clean with all the required facilities.
Great breakfast choice from the traditional Full Irish to an excellent cold table.
Well worth the visit.",4,2013,05,12
213,OK but some mishaps,"Nice and big room, but boring back yard view over satellite antennas and ventilation shafts. Wanted to do some weight lifting on first night's arrival, but the fitness room only had cardio machines (and the room was quite gloomy looking). I saved my breath for the next morning to do a jogging in the beautiful park, but luckily discovered just before running out that there was no water in the hotel (I read about this in another review, it seems to be a frequent problem). So, no training, and no shower. One participant in the business meeting that I attended was not happy since she came directly from the US in the morning after a night's flight and she could not freshen up at all before the meeting began. The hotel manager compensated by a nice note and a box of chocolate later in the day, but still this was quite a nuisance. To end on a positive note, the breakfast was very nice and the beds comfy!",3,2013,05,11
213,Fabulous weekend,"We looked on the hotel website and saw a deal for €109 for a room on Saturday night, it included a bottle of prosecco, full breakfast and overnight parking, so was very good value. We ate in the hotel bar in the evening and the food was delicious. The location was great next to a beautiful park and there were plenty of bars and restaurants nearby. All the staff were very friendly and helpful. The rooms were lovely and very comfortable, the only downside being no tea or coffee making facilities in the room. However having said that we rang room service and got 2 pots of tea with fresh milk delivered within minutes for €3, much nicer than the stuff you normally have in the room. There is no free wi-fi in the hotel, this needs to be looked at as a 4 star hotel should include this for free nowadays, at least in the lobby area, €10 a day is a hefty charge. Other than that, we would certainly recommend it.",4,2013,05,10
213,"Nothing special, no reason to go back","Nothing special to mention, modern, no charm but not bad either. Service is ok bu Irish good mood and kindness is absent: staff is mostly not Irish.

There are so many nice and charm places to stay in Dublin, this one is not to be selected by any means certainly not for family/private trip.",3,2013,05,06
213,Not happy,"Stayed one night and woke up to  not able to take a shower, flush toilet or wash hands. Rang reception who informed water pressure was down in the area.  Complained at reception when settling our bill to be told same story about the water pressure was low in the area.  We were not offered or apology or compensation.  Not impressed",4,2013,04,30
213,Lovely Hotel Next Door to Herbert Park,"Booked two rooms as was up for the rugby match with friends. Very close to the RDS and Herbert Park which a wonderful 23 acre park nestled away in the heart of Ballsbridge. Staff were very friendly, rooms lovely and spacious and very clean. The only two things which irked me somewhat was no tea of coffee making facilities in the room and a charge of €10 a day for Wi-Fi.",4,2013,04,30
213,No complaints here - a great night,"We stayed overnight after visiting the Lion King in the Bord Gais theatre. 

A good impression from word go as a member of staff came out to help me park into a tight parking space. He didn't have to, but he did and took time out of his obviously busy day.

Check in was efficient, pleasant receptionist - in fact I would struggle to find any member of staff who meet the interesting descriptions of surly staff that some people have given. I saw a couple under pressure, but was never greeted by a rude, uninterested or surly person!

The room was lovely. Now - the TV is a bit old fashioned, and the sound off it was not great - but look, thats a minor issue. It was spotless, the bathroom spotless and it was very very quiet - exactly what we needed. The bed was lovely and comfy, and wasn't hot and sticky like some hotel beds can be - it was just perfect. Something I never notice is the air conditioning - its normally crap, but its bang on here , and very quiet too.

Tea and coffee were delivered to our room on arrival - freshly brewed on a tray. I see some people complain about no tea making facilities. Personally I think all Hotel room coffee is pre-packed crap, and I would rather not drink it at all even though I love my coffee. Others will disagree - for me its a non issue.

We had a lovely meal at the restaurant... the food was top class - a little slow to serve, but thats no harm - plenty of time to digest between courses. We also had a voucher for a free glass of Prosecco and Canapes which we used after the meal. The Prosecco was lovely, the canapes never arrived - not a deal breaker, we were full anyway.

Breakfast delivered to our room was piping hot, prompt - bang on time and exactly what we ordered. No extra charge as it was part of our package, and again we were treated by a smiling server.

I'd struggle to find negatives, but in the interest of objectivity - Internet is extra. I don't think its a deal breaker, but it will matter to some. I just used my iPhones data, which most people can if they are that bothered about it. The sound off the TV was crap, again - annoying, but not a deal breaker. We ordered a 5th floor executive room with jacuzzi and got a 4th floor executive room with no jacuzzi. It wasn't a big deal, but I did feel we could have been told at check in that we were reassigned to the 4th floor.. Service a little slow at the restaurant, and no visa debit to secure the rooms? Very odd - but none of the above is a deal breaker. For these few down points I take a point off service and value, but all in all a brilliant night, a lovely - if a little pricey - hotel - highly recommended, we will return without doubt.",5,2013,04,28
213,Wouldn't stay again,"Being a regular visitor to Dublin, on this occasion we said we would try outside the city centre and chose the ballsbridge area ,we eventually settled on the Herbert park hotel. The area the hotel is located in is good with plenty of life around ,with the nearby bars and some restaurants. That's where the pluses end. On arrival @ 3.15 after a 3 hour drive we were to be told our room was not ready and they did not know when it would be , due to a late group check out. Our bags were taken and we were told we would be contacted by mobile when a room was ready ,with not much choice in the matter we waited in the bar area and had some food which was fine. At 420 my husband went to the front desk and a hassled receptionist gave him a key. The room was nice ,clean comfortable ,what you would expect in a 4 star. 
As we settled in we then were very surprised to find Wifi is not free and at a charge of 10 € for a 24 hour period. In this day and age I find this most unusual given that even a McDonald's restaurant nowadays provide free wifi for customers. 
The following morning when we arrived at reception to check out ,there was a significant queue resulting in a 15 minute wait to reach the front desk. I haven't come across this anywhere before in the many hotels I've stayed in, the staff themselves were doing their best. It seemed more like a systems failure or a failing in properly preparing for what was obviously a busy weekend in the Herbert park..
There is too much choice in Dublin, hotel wise and for this and the above reasons I would not be returning.
The expression "" you never get a second chance to make a first impression"" comes to mind.",2,2013,04,28
213,Great Hotel,"Great Hotel; Great Location, Booked interconnecting room with kids, very clean which is great to see, only negative is that no Leisure Centre if you were to stay for an extended period; would highly rcommend as a short break location in Dublin City",4,2013,04,28
213,Relaxing and very comfortable,"Had to book an overnight at short notice and got a reasonable room only rate. The location is great, looking onto Herbert Park. Set back from the nearby main road in a pedestrianised area, it adds to the relaxed atmosphere I enjoyed. The rooms are well appointed and a good size. I chose continental breakfast at €15.50 rather than €19.50 for the cooked option. It was an easy choice as the selection was excellent, fresh and well presented. Looking out onto the gardens and park, it was a good way to start a busy day. Only gripe - paying extra for wi-fi seems progressively mean when paying a reasonable amount for a room. On site underground parking overnight at €10 is not bad value.",4,2013,04,22
213,comfortable and spotless,Stayed in the Herbert Park for 1 night  this month and must say it was the most comfortable and spotless hotel that ive stayed in a long while. Staff were most helpful and the twin room was spacious and immaculately clean. Hotel is close to bars and the lovely Rolys bistro is a short stroll. City centre is also convenient with taxis never too far away. Overall a lovely stay.,4,2013,04,17
213,Clean and very comfortable,"Stayed in this Hotel for the weekend, going to a concert at Vicar St.  Hotel Within walking distance of city centre quite a nice half hour walk, plenty buses taxis etc outside.  This Hotel is in a lovely part of Dublin, few pubs across the road, coffee shop Spar etc. rooms spotless, beds comfortable, nice breakfast, and an underground car park. Would recommend.",4,2013,04,16
213,Herbert Park,"This was our second stay in the Herbert Hotel but the first time we had brought the children. The rooms were excellent and very clean. The staff put a lot of effort into making the atmosphere very relaxed but whenever a query arose, they were the height of professionalism and response.The children took advantage of pizza and a movie in their room while we had dinner in the restaurant. Both parties were very happy with the service and quality of food. Breakfast was a well stocked buffet and we had time for a walk in the adjoining park before making the journey home. I couldn;t praise the hotel more.",5,2013,04,15
213,"Good hotel, good location","I stayed for a one night room only. They have single rooms, which is unusual but quite handy. The room is small-ish but perfectly adequate and the single bed is more like a standard double.

Don't know what the food or bar are like but the room was great, the overall quality of the hotel very good. Handy location and about 20 minute walk into Grafton St area.

Only thing I would fault was the television which was on the old side. Not a big gripe.",4,2013,04,15
213,Deal Or No Deal,"It is great at the moment for Deals in Irish Hotels due to the current economic situation and the over supply of rooms particularly in the greater Dublin area. When I was looking for a hotel in Ballsbridge I was delighted to get a reasonable deal for a triple room in the Herbert Park as I had been here for lunch before and it was very nice. However, We were not impressed at all with this Hotel. The deal did not include breakfast which was fair enough. You get what you pay for. However the biggest thing that surprised me was the lack of tea & coffee facilities in the room. This is a basic thing to expect from any four star hotel but when we said it to the staff their answer was if you want Tea or Coffee order from Room Service and pay for it. The ""Triple"" room was set for two people, 2 glasses- 2 hand towels- 2 shampoo, and it did not have a hair dryer which again is a basic expectation for a hotel room. The Hotel also charged €10 for parking.  All in all I would not stay here again as although they are offering rooms at more competitive prices its like they try to claw as much money on extras as they can from you. There are much better hotels available in the city at cheaper prices. No Frills Hotel.",2,2013,04,14
213,A most relaxing stay,"This was our first time to stay in the Herbert Park hotel. It was a lovely experience. From our arrival to departure we were treated royally. We were very impressed with all the staff. So friendly, courteous and helpful.The decor was lovely and everything kept so clean, well worth a visit. We had a lovely walk the next morning in the amazing Park beside the hotel. This was a real discovery as we love walking and to find this space in Dublin on the hotel's doorstep was a bonus. We enjoyed our stay so much that we have already booked our next trip.",5,2013,04,14
213,Nice Modern Hotel,We stayed here for one night recently and found the hotel to be a very pleasent place to stay.  The staff in every department were most helpful and bubbly.  The hotel is very clean and modern with nice decor in the bedrooms and hallways.  it is in a great location and not too far from the city centre.  I would stay here again.,5,2013,04,09
213,Fabulous weekend in the Herbert Park,"I booked a weekend in april with my friend and chose to stay in the Herbert park Hotel in Ballsbridge. From the moment we parked the car, our stay couldn't have been more relaxing. The receptionist was so professional and friendly at check.  I had booked a twin room, and initially we were given a double room, but as soon as we we contacted reception we were up graded and changes to a larger room without any hesitation. The rooms are beautifully decorated, clean, spacious bright and comfortable, although bathrooms are moderate in size, they are impeccable and in perfect condition. We dined in the restaraunt and enjoyed a fabulous 3 course meal. The breakfast was amazing, everything from fresh fruit and youghurts, cold cheese and meats, variety of cereal and breads to full irish breakfasts and pancakes. All the staff were extremely friendly, efficient, professional and helpful. The hotel location is so central to Dublin city, and yet so spacious and peaceful at night with no noise from the surrounding city night life. Again checking out was a breeze, swift friendly and prompt. I'll definitely be staying in the Herbert Park for my next visit to Dublin.",5,2013,04,09
213,Great hotel and great staff,Stayed in the Herbert park for a the weekend and it was perfect. The staff are extremely friendly the food was excellent quality and the hotel is spotless. The area is about 5 mins by bus into the city centre but there is fab bars and restaurants 2 minute walk away. I really enjoyed my stay and can't wait to go back.,5,2013,04,07
213,First Stay,"Just want to say thank you to the staff of the Herbert Park for making our 2 night stay ideal. This was our first experience of this hotel chosen for proximity to RDS - just across the road. Room was great, breakfast lovely & evening meal delicious. All staff were friendly, very helpful & efficient. Just a bus ride into Dublin City centre - but could walk no problem. Can't wait to go back.",5,2013,04,06
213,A trip to Herbert Park is in my DNA!!!,"I love this hotel. Have been many times and will go back many more. Got 2 night deal on the Indulgent Package with drinks, canapés, car parking etc all included. We found ALL the staff very friendly. Ehle (excuse me if I  spelt that wrong) checked us in and she is a lovely friendly girl with the right personality for front of house. We also met Francesco and enjoyed his Italian Charm!!  
The bar staff were all very attentive.  This is a quiet hotel but was quieter than usual this time and we also found the City Centre quieter too. Perhaps the weather had left it's mark! 
Ali checked us out and we had a chat and a laugh with him. Another friendly ambassador for the Herbert Park. 

The only negative I would have is that our room, 416, was looking a bit tired. Scuffed wallpaper and paintwork otherwise the facilities in the room were fine.",4,2013,04,04
213,Very good again,This was our third time staying in the Herbert Park hotel. This time like the previous two we enjoyed a very pleasant stay. Reception and bar staff are extremely friendly and helpful.  Parkview room is quiet and peaceful overlooking Herbert Park. We stayed on a package again which included car parking and pre or post dinner prosecco and canapes and obviously bed and breakfast. This is very good value. The hotel is in a good location in Ballsbridge close to city centre and overall experience means we will definitely be back to stay again.,4,2013,04,03
213,Rugby Trip,"On our recent trip succesfully defeating the might of Leincester and  to a lesser extent Munster , last Easter weekend we had a most delightful stay at the Herbert Park Hotel .. Th staff , from the reception desk to the dining room and bar area were extremly pleasant and courteus in a very understated way
All in all a succesfull trip in more ways than one . We will , like General McArthur , return",5,2013,04,02
213,Avrkar 50,"We stayed at this hotel on the 30 of September for our partners 50th birthday. the service that we had was excellent, the rooms were clean and also the staff were polite and very helpfull very conveniant for the shops pubs and restaurants. We had a special package added to our break, and this was sorted by our friend,",5,2013,03,31
213,Not so family friendly,"Poor welcome on arrival.
Rooms poor.
Restaurant closed until 6:00
Breakfast fair.
Not great for families with young kids
Hotel had a very clinical approach to customer.
Room wasn't bad. Biggest complaint staff and service esp' restaurant",2,2013,03,30
213,Very disappointed,"The hotel is fine but the service poor. Bar staff were inattentive. The bathroom smelled of cigarete smoke  We ordered room service, as we were paying with debit card we had to pay up front (which is fine) but they did not have a working portable chip and pin machine, so when it arrived I was told to follow him down to the bar to pay. Half of our breakfast arrived the following morning, by the time they brought the rest all was cold. Nothing major but still very annoying.",2,2013,03,26
213,Good hotel as usual- no complaints,I have stayed in this hotel approx six times. Twice in park view rooms twice in adjoining rooms with our teenage children and double rooms. We have always taken advantage of the special packages and feel that these cannot be beaten by any Dublin hotel. Staff always helpful and pleasant. This is a great hotel location wise too. Will definitely return.,4,2013,03,25
213,Not happy,"Had lunch there today, had to pay for parking after spending 40 euro on food another 8 euro... No baby changing table to change my daugher so had to change her on the floor, man at the front desk very rude....",1,2013,03,18
213,"Great hotel, great location","My husband and I have stayed at the Herbert Park Hotel 3-4 times a year for the past 5 years or so and each time we come away thinking how great to be able to stay somewhere where we can easily park, that is within 12-15 minutes of the city centre  and where we can always be sure of getting the very best service at the best price. You guys are doing a great job - the indulgence package is awesome value and we will be back again soon!",5,2013,03,09
213,Can't believe they charge for toothpaste!!!!,A bit Ryanair I think! Who would have thought a business/ leisure hotel in embassy belt would charge for toothpaste. Otherwise pleasant if sterile corporate feel. Models itself as a midrange hotel in upmarket area,3,2013,03,07
213,Nice modern hotel with good location,"Really nice hotel with modern large rooms. Great location in Dublin especially if you are going to an event in either the RDS or the Aviva Stadium! Underground parking available although at a cost even to guests which I always find a bad thing....

15 minute walk into Grafton Street area. 5 minutes to either the RDS or Aviva Stadium.

Did not eat in the hotel so cannot comment although there was no coffee/tea making facilities in room but are available from Room Service at a ridiculously high cost!!!",4,2013,03,01
213,excellent hotel,"It's best to book the overnight indulgence deal, breakfast, parking and free drink and canapés included. It is the best value in dublin. Lovely staff, lovely neighborhood, just a short bus ride or 15 minute walk from city centre.",5,2013,02,27
213,Excellent Hotel good location,I stay at the Herbert Park Hotel on a regular basis when i travel to Dublin and am always very happy with the experience. The hotel is located in a lovely park close to the Aviva Stadium and beside excellent restaurants and shops. A bus stop is located outside the hotel and you can be in the center of Dublin in 10 minutes. The hotel has an underground car park and a taxi rank outside the door.I have always found the staff friendly and helpful and the room large bright and very clean. The room rates are excellent value for such a lovely part of Dublin and the hotel feels a lot more luxurious than you would expect for the rate paid. Will continue to stay here for my shopping and rugby trips to Dublin!,5,2013,02,27
213,Very Good in Dublin,"The first thing to say about the Herbert Park is that although it's expensive we had an excellent stay there over the weekend. We originally had a standard room with no extras but thanks to registering my email address we heard about a current offer that upgraded us and included breakfast for no extra cost (and a bottle of Prosecco per night thrown in!).
The hotel is nice, clean and accessible. Our room was big (superior, I think) and comfortable. 
The staff attentive and polite - even the room cleaners are chatty and outgoing. Overall, the staff were impeccable and really made us feel at ease. The food and drink was very nice but very expensive, and seems to cater for all tastes.
To sum up - if you want a top class modern hotel in Dublin I would go here - thoroughly recommended.",4,2013,02,27
213,"Good Hotel, well located","Stayed here in February 2013 with my partner. We had gotten a decent price for bed and breakfast and having stayed before, we knew what to expect. Underground parking is available and was complimentary. Check in was, as usual, professional and fast.
There is something about the lobby, reception area etc that lends a clinical feel to the overall experience, which is a pity. This is probably as a result of the 'vastness' and totally open feel of the lobby.
Bedroom on Floor 4 with a view of Herbert Park was good. Comfortable bed, lots of towels etc etc.
I would recommend this hotel for someone who wants to avoid the hustle and bustle of staying in the city centre, but yet is near enough to walk if one wants. a 15/20 minute stroll will get you to St Stephen's Green.
By the way, there are many good restaurants within 200m of the hotel - Kites Chinese (i haven't been there but I believe its excellent), Roly's Bistro (superb!) Baan Thai (very good) Lobster Pot (very good but expensive) and a few other casual dining spots and pubs.",4,2013,02,22
213,Fawlty Towers & food poison.,"What can i say about this business pretending to operate within the hotel industry. I have stayed in better budget hotels for a third of the price. An extra ten euro to park in their own car park. Poor signage at front door as to where parking is. How does a stranger know where 'angelsea rd' is? Smoking area would be more appropiate on a building site. The man working at reception would make a bull dog licking urine off nettles look happier. Stayed in room 224, sink needed replaced 2 years ago. Pay for tea in room? TV in room where thrown out in UK hotels in the 1990's.Had dinner. My word what can I say, about the food poison that my wife and I have had for the past 4 days. A medium rare steak that was cremated. Everything on the plate tasted the same. Complain at the time, the staff had no interest in their job. Pay 20 euro for a buffet breakfast are you people for real. had to stand in the queue for the buffet breakfast, as no food in serving dishes. Give up waiting on bacon when I saw what oither people had received. Tables virtually on top of one another. Complained at reception, and the response was, 'ok'. Would have been better paying the extra £45 to stay in the Shelbourne, as it was on trivago for £136. Well done to all at the Herbert Park.",1,2013,02,20
213,Good Business Hotel,"I had reason to stay at the Herbert Park Hotel during a Rugby Weekend in Dublin. The hotel its self is centrally located, professionally run, modern with all the standard amenities one would expect of a business hotel. the one serious issue i had was on the day of the game buffet lunch in the restaurant  cost €59 per person. it was a standard meal which should have cost no more that €25, disappointing.",4,2013,02,15
213,Excellent Valentine's offer,"Got special"" Valentine's ""offer for Friday 8th, Double room, kingsized bed, Breakfast and parking included with 750ml bottle Prosecco chilling on arrival, for €109 inclusive of free parking.
I thought this was excellent value bearing in mind the location of the Hotel and the sporting weekend it was.
Quality of sleep was first class.
Breakfast was buffet but lots of fresh fruit and cheeses etc. Hot section also.
We also had poached eggs to accompany, unfortunately over-done.
Nonetheless breakfast was great and service very attentive.
Checking in and out seamless.
Have stayed here several times before and have always enjoyed it. Restaurant and lounge food is usually top notch as well.",5,2013,02,11
213,Disappointing,"Beautiful hotel overlooking Herbert Park.  Rooms were spacious, immaculately clean and beds were very comfortable.  The bathroom was also very clean but there was only one hand towel supplied between two people. There was no courtesy trays and I wasn't prepared to pay €3.50 every time I wanted to have a cup of tea during the night.  Breakfast was also a big let down. The bacon appeared to have been reheated and was as tough as nails, and the mushrooms and tomatoes were tasteless.  I have had better tasting food from service stations.  

I won't be returning as I can book a three star hotel with all the extras for less than the cost of this four star hotel.",3,2013,02,03
213,Not quite value for money but still gorgeous,"Stayed there for 5 nights. Excellent service, beautifull rooms, everything was splendid except for the ""smoking alienation"". No smoker rooms, and no smoking lounge. I am aware that smoking in Ireland is forbiden but there should at least be a smoking spot with heaters or something, not joust simple ""shelter"" that is literaly like a waiting cabin for local busses.
Room was perfectly clean allthough there was some kind of mixup with the furniture - sitting area 2 sofas of different kind and pattern - like they lost one and youst replaced it with other one. There is joust one wall jack that can actually be used because all the others are ocupied with lamps and such and cannot be used (no way to declutch a lamp).
Breakfast buffet is ok. Had to pay 15 euros for so called ""continental breakfast"" which I think is way too much for a simple breakfast - what if you joust want cereals with milk???
Wifi costs 10 euros per day.",5,2013,02,03
213,"Nice Hotel, Nice People, Good location BUT I feel ripped off","I stay in many hotels across the UK and am about to sign contracts to do business in Ireland.  In all the hotels I've stayed in I have never not had tea and coffee making facilities.  Instead this hotel charges 3.50 euros to deliver them.  Also the WIFI was 10 euros. No Iron or ironing board. The hotel is missing the point on client experience.  I paid a premium price of £97 not including breakfast, to stay here because of the location.  I could have stayed at Bewleys for £57.  If you are paying a premium price you expect a premium experience and I didn't get it",3,2013,02,01
213,"OK, but quality is less than it used to be","Stayed two nights in this hotel end of January, hotel still ok but management should be careful because hotel is somewhat deteriorating looking at the furniture in the room and stains on carpet.
I stay here every year for a conference, breakfast buffet still ok. Had to pay 14 euros for an adopter which could not be borrowed.
Bed is a bit hard but sleeping quality incl pillows ok.",3,2013,01,30
213,"Nice hotel, convenient location.....","THe Herbert Park Hotel is well situated close to the convention center and a short distance from downtown. The service is excellent and the rooms are comfortable and well maintained.
There may be some room for improvement at the restaurant, mainly for breakfast as to quality of food and selection.
the hotel offers wifi at a daily charge and to be able to use several devices becomes cumbersome  - each one requires a id and password and daily log in. 
Other then that I can only recommend the place.",4,2013,01,30
213,Okay,"Old fashioned, bulky tv in room. 
Noise from some sort of fan outside bedroom window, which was disappointing as I had asked for a quiet room. 
Cost of parking car extra ten euro.
Not overly friendly staff",3,2013,01,28
213,Amazing! My favourite hotel in Dublin,"This hotel is amazing! So private, no interference, amazing food! Rooms are so clean as is the hotel. Love love love it! 
Downside: residents pay for parking!!!??!!! And also pay for the wifi?! 
However positives outweigh negatives here although the parking thing is a turnoff!",5,2013,01,18
213,excellent as usual,"returned  with my husband at beginning of December
had a lovely relaxing break as usual with the prosecco special offer.
room lovely over looking the front of the hotel, yet very quiet.
used to stay alot but have not been for a while.
my one gripe is that i used to adore the breakfast, but the quality has slipped a bit.
STREAKY RASHERS!
please bring back the really good quality bacon you used to have.
love the late check out with the special offer.
good atmosphere when a match on.",5,2013,01,14
213,Family friendly hotel ????,"We only want to let potential families know the extra costs that in our opinion is greedy and takes advantage of families with young children. We tried to book our family in for one night and the cost was € 219 which was a double room and an adjoining room with twin Beds. In fairness  this price also included breakfast for two adults and 3 children 10,7,4. The Herbert Park is a fine hotel and it would be wrong of us to make any comment about anything else other than our booking experience as we didn't end up staying there. The issue we had is for anyone reading this review to decide for themselves if this is right or wrong. We asked for an extra pull up bed for our 4 year old son and we were told that there would be an extra charge of € 40. We felt that this was very unfair and showed a complete lack of understanding what it is like for a young family to go away to Dublin and stay over. Maybe as parents this might be over sensitive but surely the hotel that was not fully booked should have been happy with € 219 and just give us the bed for the sake of 10 mins making it up and some extra linen . We have stayed in the hotel before without our children and have always had an excellent service and we would still be happy to recommend it to people but this time round we are just disappointed more than anything else.",1,2013,01,10
213,Great Value,"I have stayed in the Herbert Park over the years both on business and as a weekend break.  The hotel is very well situated for the wide range of facilities available in the D4 area - Aviva, RDS, restaurants.  It is great value for money and the standard of decor and service is well above average.  However, it is our feeling that the breakfast options have been pruned (!)  back over the past few years and whilst the breakfast used to be exceptional it is now merely ordinary.  Will still keep returning though.",4,2013,01,09
213,A pleasant stay,"I stayed at the Herbert Park hotel 2 nights mainly to sleep peacefully Jan 1. Although I was told it was not possible to have a quiet single room when I checked -in (that was not very welcoming), I did sleep well, the level of noise was very low indeed. The room was clean, comfortable and warm.",4,2013,01,08
213,Very Pleasant,"This Hotel is very good value...B+B,parking,with drinks and canapés all for under €130 per room, and in Ballsbridge.
We stayed the weekend before Xmas and the hotel was very quiet.
The room was comfy and clean, the breakfast hot and plentiful.
Our only only concern was the absence of Bathrobes in room and no bottled water on bed side on return to Hotel at night.
All in all a pleasant nights stay",4,2013,01,01
213,Good value,"Have stayed here a couple of times including this week.  I like the location and it is good value for money.  Room was large and clean - only issue was that there was no place to charge phone - all sockets in room were round pin!  

Cold breakfast was good - hot breakfast did not look very appetising - heard others complain it was cold

Reception staff were to the point and could be more friendly - surprisingly hotel did not seem very busy whereas many others in the city were booked out.

All that said I would stay again if good rates continue",3,2012,12,30
213,One of the few remaining family run hotels in D4 but with a low cost mentality !,"Stayed. At this hotel on 29th December 2012. 
The hotel is very clean with excellent staff in the restaurant. However, both the inefficiency and that attitude at the front desk leaves a lot to be desired. One expects an Irish welcome in an Irish hotel, whether the front desk manager is Irish or not. When I requested a delayed check out by one hour, I was told that I either pay an extra €50 and stay until 4 pm or leave at 12 midday as the house-keeping staff were under pressure. We all know that except for a few RDS attendees this is not a busy time for a business hotel.
Personally, I stay in hotels for business on a very regular basis WW, and an attitude like this in my home country is disappointing to say the least.
I agree with other trip advisor review regarding the extra cost for the Internet and very old fashioned TVs.

Hope the Herbert Park Management sort out the attitude at the front desk so that people have a better first impression of Ireland. 

Happy new year",2,2012,12,30
213,Good location and reasonable value,"The hotel is in a good location near RDS and Aviva Stadium, where I saw the ASM against Leinster rugby match.  Plus, if you are traveling from the airport, the Aircoach bus stops just across the street.  There are great dining options nearby as well.

As with everyone else, I will gripe against the paid Internet.  When will this hotel wake up and stop using it as a profit center?  Same goes for the ancient TVs and reception.  Lamentable.  If the hotel would upgrade its Internet access to free, wi-fi included, and install flat-screen TVs, the experience would be much better.

As for the reception, it was serviceable at best.  No smile, only helpful if asked.  When will hotels realize that teaching simple greetings is the best way to begin a satisfactory customer experience?",3,2012,12,18
213,Beautiful hotel,Stayed in this hotel while visiting the Craft Fair in RDS. Great staff and were most helpful. Beautiful room with huge bed and was spotless as was the bathroom.  Very convenient to RDS and surrounded by great restaurants. Will definitely be back again,5,2012,12,09
213,Highly recommended,"Stayed in this hotel recently on a Christmas shopping trip to Dublin and really enjoyed the experience.  Starting with the receptionist, Egle, we were made to feel very welcome and were given a lovely spacious room.  The breakfast is amazing - everything you could possibly want and beautifully fresh.  Also the car parking was included in the room price which is a big plus.  All in all I would highly recommend this hotel and will definitely be staying there again.",5,2012,12,03
213,perfect choice,"Stayed at this hotel for one night recently.  Great stay and a special mention to the lovely staff at reception ,Rommel and Ely who were most helpful and pleasant.   The hotel is situated in a quiet area and close to some good restaurants.  Would definitely stay again.",4,2012,12,02
213,Clean comfortable hotel,Stayed here for one night . Check in was fast . Room was spotless and very comfortable with adjustable heating. Great selection of breakfast food. Staff were very pleasant. Would recommend for business travellers .,4,2012,12,01
213,Dublin's best boutique hotel,"The Herbert Park is a clean, modern and bright hotel overlooking one of Dublin's finest parks. Big enough to enable guests relax and enjoy the facilities in private, and small enough to ensure excellent and friendly service, this hotel is the smart choice for a weekend visit or business trip to Dublin. The staff are are smartly dressed, polite and very helpful whether you need a book taxi to the airport, or just borrow an umbrella!   

We have stayed at most hotels in Dublin, including the 5-star and big chain hotels, but we keep coming back to the Herbert Park for its location, consistently high standards, and reasonable prices. Why pay more, or settle for less?

See you again soon!

CJ Candy",4,2012,11,28
213,Good hotel if going to RDS or Aviva,"We were in Dublin for an exhibition at the RDS and wanted a hotel close to the venue and within walking distance of restaurants.  The Herbert Park fitted the bill very nicely.  The rooms were modern and pleasant and a good size, and wi-fi was available for a FEE; for a modern 4 star hotel inn 21st century this should be included in the price. Also, no tea/coffee making facilities in the room, just a little card saying that tea/coffee could be delivered for a small fee, (glad I took the ever reliable travel kettle). Car parking was also available at extra charge but worth it and we were able to keep the car parked after checking out at Noon until we were ready to leave much later that afternoon.
The breakfasts were good, but on the busier morning, (Sunday), the restocking of the hot buffet was not as efficient as it should have been, but he freshly squeezed orange juice was great!
We ate dinner in the restaurant on the first evening and while the choice and food itself was very good there was no atmosphere as there was only one other couple dining.  There are a lot of restaurants within walking distance which provide a range of alternatives.
One compliant - I sat for 20 minutes in the bar area on Saturday afternoon and no-one ever inquired if I would like anything to eat or drink, in the end I retired to my room and my trusty travel kettle!
Overall a good hotel if going to the Aviva stadium or any event in the RDS and 30 minutes will walk you into the city centre.
Tip - look out for bed and breakfast rates, usually available on the hotel website.",4,2012,11,26
213,great location and family friendly hotel,"Stayed at the Herbert Park as we were going to the Ireland Argentina rugby match.  The hotel is so close to the stadium it is a perfect location.  Staff were very friendly, helpful and approachable.  Breakfast was excellent and we enjoyed the walk into central Dublin the next day which took approximately 20 mts.  Although the hotel was very busy and we were unable to eat in the hotel on Saturday we took a stroll across the road from the hotel and took advantage of one of the many excellent restaurants on their doorstep. 

My husband and I stayed at the Herbert Park around 11 years ago but werevery impressed that the standards have remained high.  Will not wait so long to revisit.",5,2012,11,26
213,Very Good Hotel,"My daughter was graduating in Dublin very early in the morning so we decided to go up the evening before and I chose the Herbert Park, firstly because of location to the college and secondly on price. €109. per room with breakfast. 
Being a 4 star hotel this was indeed a good price, the Westbury and Westin and Shelbourne understanding they are 5 star were extortionately priced.  Check in was quick and painless by a friendly receptionist although it took us (sad) a while to work out why the lift didn't work... you had to insert your keycard and off we went !!! 
Breakfast was very good from all types of fresh fruit breads croissants and danish to the full Irish. One important tip.. when opening the domes for cooked breakfast be careful  my daughter was blasted with trapped steam and received a nasty burn on her hand. 

All in all a pleasant stay at a pleasant and affordable price.",4,2012,11,20
213,Pleasant stay,"My wife and I stayed at the Herbert Park for two nights on 9 and 10 November and have the following comments:

The Good:
 - The hotel is very clean and modern.
 - The breakfasts were very good and offered a wide variety of food.
 - The room was comfortable and quiet.
 - The room air-conditioner was effective.
 - The location is very good, as it is opposite the Herbert Park (i.e. nice for walks, jogs, views, etc) and a 5 minute walk from the Aviva stadium. It is a short bus/cab ride to the Dublin city centre, or about a 20 minute walk to same.
 - There are good restaurants very close to the hotel – e.g. Roly’s, etc

The average:
 - The gym was very small and had outdated equipment. That said, at least it had a gym!
 - It cost 10 Euros per day for wifi use.
 - We asked if they had a double adaptor that we could use for a few hours, but were told that we should buy one for EUR15.
 - The bar area was OK.

I can’t comment on the price, as I was staying at the hotel as a guest.

Overall, I thought that the Herbert Park was very good for a four star hotel and I would certainly return if I was attending the Aviva stadium, but maybe not if I was just visiting Dublin in general.",4,2012,11,15
213,Convenient and comfortable,"I stayed here for one night to attend a funeral.
Impressive hotel with nice modern feel.
Room was inviting, warm and very comfortable. I did find the pillows a bit hard but despite that I had a great night's sleep!
Very quiet considering the hotel is in the city.
TV was an older model and the picture was poor.
Room service food bland and expensive for what I had.
Extremely clean throughout.
Great location for visiting the city.",4,2012,11,06
213,lovely location but lacks tea making facilities in bedroom.,"Nice location beside Herbert Park.
I had to go down to reception 3 times as my key did not work in door! I felt I was rather dismissed and as I am a seasoned traveller and never had this problem before I felt it was a negative experience.
Another objection I had was the smell of take aways in the lift! I was really surprised to see several people getting on lift with a take away !!",3,2012,11,06
213,Nice & comfy,This hotel was clean nice and comfy.  The breakfast buffet not only looked beautiful but tasted as good.  They had a wide assortment of breakfast foods.  My only complaint was that it was a bit far from the action in Dublin.  I usually prefer to walk and it was a little too far.,4,2012,11,03
213,Dublin marathon special,"My son from London and friend were taking part in Dublin marathon . Herbert park had an excellent deal allowing early breakfast before marathon and a late checkout,4.00 pm to give time for a shower after the run.Free parking was also included..
Rooms were good and service all round was excellent.A very clean,modern and efficient hotel",5,2012,11,02
213,nicely located,Generally nice 4 stars hotel. However i must say that again i have been challanged with the reception assistance with taxi booking. Not all requests have been passed to the driver (i.e. requirement for credit card payment or booking to the room account). Hotel will not help you much if you do not have the local electricity adaptor - they may only offer you the device to be bought for something like 3 times higher price than normal.,3,2012,11,02
213,Price/Quality very good,"The hotel is right outside the city centre, you can walk into town (20 min) or take a bus; a taxi will cost you 7-10 euro. We used this hotel for business and pleasure and have not been disappointed. Clean and comfortable rooms (pillows not great!), quiet location, good restaurants in the area (Japanese resto Koishi is very good). Pity about the 10 euro wi-fi, hotels (in general) should really stop charging for usage. Staff not very warm and welcoming but professional. Easy parking for 10 euro/night.",4,2012,11,01
213,Modern hotel in parkland surroundings,"Over the past 5 years or so, I have had occasion to stay at the Herbert Park both with family and on business trips. 10 minutes by bus to Nassau street, set back off the main road and really quiet - this is an ideal hotel for a business/city break. On my last stay - for a family celebration - we were upgraded to a suite overlooking the lovely Herbert Park. The staff took great care and we really found the accommodation excellent value for money. This place is modern and efficient and hence not a romantic boutique get-away if that's what you seek. We've eaten breakfast and brunch on occasion there and found the food fresh, ample and well-presented. 
Parking and internet access are additional charges (€10 each per diem) they could do away with: and that's my only gripe. We'll be here again.",4,2012,10,26
213,Consistently good hotel,"We always stay at the Herbert Park when in Dublin as it is consistently good. We have stayed in most of the other 4 star hotels in Dublin and have been disappointed with the lack of consistency, one time excellent and then poor for the next stay. Over the last 10 years we have stayed here on dozens of occasions and have never been disappointed. The service is to a high standard, the rooms are well appointed and the air conditioning always works properly and is individually controlled. If asked we would always recommend the Herbert Park Hotel particularly the ""indulgence Package"". The special offers are always good value.

Tim",4,2012,10,25
213,Not friendly or convenient to Dublin Center,"This hotel was very luxurious and modern but cold. The front desk made us feel like they were looking down at us. They did what was needed but they seemed condescending. Our plane arrived at 9:00 AM but they would not let us check in early even with advance notice. Food was good but everything was very pricey. The hotel is in Ballsbridge, a nice area but not close enough to walk downtown and cabs were expensive. Handy to Aviva stadium or US Embassy. Would not choose here again.",3,2012,10,25
213,Nice hotel,"A really nice hotel but the internet access is really a joke. You need to pay 10 Euros a day by device. For one of the official hotels of the Dublin Web Summit, it was really not correct. The hotel it self is good and the rooms were pretty big. The minibar full of drinks but no Guiness. Strange for the Guiness's country isn't it ?",4,2012,10,21
213,Excellent Hotel,Every time we go to Dublin we stay at this hotel. It is excellent and the staff are a delight. The rooms are bright and spacious and very well maintained and air conditioned. There is also a very nice bar and foyer area. The breakfast is always superb.,5,2012,10,19
213,Decent business hotel,"Stayed one night for the websummit.

Room was OK, check-in efficient.

The usual ridiculous wifi rip-off - if you pay almost 200 euros, how dare they still charge for internet access, which costs them virtually nothing? It's theft, pure and simple.

Food (room-service) was really quite average (and very expensive for the quality offered), but service was good.",3,2012,10,18
213,"Very good hotel, great breakfast!","Clean and comfortable rooms, good beds. properly assigned 4 star rating. In terms of location, a good 20 minute walk to Grafton street, but buses come regularly. Staff pleasant and helpful. The breakfast selection was excellent! I liked the hotel but wished it was a bit closer to the action!",4,2012,10,13
213,businessman,Our company has been using the lodging and conference facilities at the Herbert Park hotel for several years.  The facilities are excellent and the staff are both friendly and very professional.  The location is excellent.  It is adjacent to Herbert Park and there are a varity of good restaruants nearby.  We would certainly recommend the hotel as a venue for company board and shareholder meetings.,4,2012,10,11
213,Enjoyable Stay,"We recently stayed at the Herbert Park hotel while in Dublin for the Emerald Classic (Go Irish!) and were very pleased with the hotel.  If you are attending an event at the Aviva Stadium, the location is simply unbeatable.  We were able to walk there easily, and given the chaos of buses, taxi's and more after the game, were more than delighted to stroll back to our hotel.  We had booked a garden view room, and once we were able to settle in the right room, were very pleased with the spacious room and large windows looking over the park with the hills off in the distance.  Be warned that there are two types of executive rooms, (Garden views or  Fifth floor executives) and the first one we were shown was much smaller (but with an enormous en suite), but no view.  It took a bit of discussion before we were switched to the room I had booked.  But to be fair to them, the hotel was quite literally inundated with travelers there for the game, and they were doing their best to cope.  After that hiccup, I found all the stuff friendly and helpful.  And I do enjoy staying in Ballsbridge (and bemoan the loss of The Hibernian); a lovely part of town, yet convenient to central Dublin.  A morning walk in Herbert Park was a lovely way to begin the day. The lobby lounge is a great spot for a light breakfast or evening meal.",4,2012,10,10
213,good hotel,"Beautiful decor and ambiance. very nice pavilion dining room for breakfast.
 Excellent Bar food and great upgrade to room with park view.
Dreadful TV in room with unwatchable picture and poor programmes.
Shower was a dribble.

great location beside Herbert Park and near Aviva Stadium",4,2012,10,09
213,Memorable cozy hotel,"Stayed in this cozy hotel for 5 nights in a business trip. It's located in a quite neighborhood, right next to Herbert Park. Arrived in the hotel early but the staffs were more than happy to provide our room ready exactly as reserved.

The room is average but clean. I like the spacious high-ceiling bathroom with adequate amenities replenished everyday. Great service! However, it's gonna be even greater if the hotel provides free wi-fi in the entire property.

Breakfast was average in terms of taste and variation with what so called 'Full Irish Breakfast'. But it served delightful lunch menus, I still remember how delicious the smoked salmon was, hmm..

To spend your time after all day activity, you can have a 20-minute walk to Grafton Street. It's always enjoyable to have some walks in Dublin.

Overall, it was a great experience and will definitely be back to Herbert Park Hotel when I have a chance to visit Dublin again.",4,2012,10,05
213,Good Modern  Hotel with good Location,"I stay at this hotel on a regular basis---it is my first choice hotel in Dublin.
The Ballsbridge location is excellent ---adjacent to the RDS ,a 5 min. walk to the Aviva for Rugby/Soccer and Concerts and a 20 min. walk from Grafton Street.
The hotel is also adjacent to  Herbert Park, ideal for a relaxing stroll.
The Hotel has a bright and modern lobby and the rooms are excellent.
The staff are friendly and most helpful.
The lobby restaurant serves good food in a relaxing environment( but is a little pricey!)
I don't have the breakfast, as I believe it is overpriced at €19.50!
The car-parking charge of €10/night is fine for 1 night but I would suggest that €10 per stay should be considered.
My biggest criticism is that wifi access should be free and not  charged €10/day.
I strongly recommend the Herbert Park.",4,2012,10,02
213,Pleasant hotel off city centre of Dublin,"We stayed 4 nights in this 4star hotel. When we arrived at 2pm, our rooms weren't quite ready (check in is 3pm). The manager was very accommodating and rushed house keeping to get our rooms ready ASAP. Further she managed to get us connecting rooms. We very much appreciated her help. 

The hotel is a fair distance from city centre. By taxi it coasts around €11 for a family of 4. We never tried the bus but would be slightly less. On foot it would be about a 30-40min leisurely walk. But if you are looking for a quiet place to relax, this hotel is it as it is away from the bustle of Grafton st. There are 2 convenience stores that have almost everything. There is a nice Chinese restaurant just in front of the hotel, several nice Italian restaurants. There's a good coffee place (Insomnia chain) where we had our breakfast several mornings.

Rooms were clean, modern and a good size. Everything in the room worked so no complaints there. Our housekeeping did a wonderful job while we stayed there. Staff were generally nice and polite though not extraordinary friendly, unlike the service we received from the rest of Dubliners( warm, friendly , extremely helpful).

Irritations: the bathroom sound proofing was poor. We could here our child singing when he was in his bathroom and we were in ours at the same time. Also our bathroom fan wasn't working. We told reception twice but nothing was done. It was still not working when we checked out after 5 days in the hotel. We never ate at the hotel restaurant. Other than the locating, bathroom fan, and room soundproofing, the hotel was very nice. We enjoyed our stay and Dublin.

We would stay in this hotel again.",4,2012,10,02
213,"Decent hotel, terrible Internet access policy.","We stayed here overnight for an event in the city centre. Good breakfast, either continental or full Irish. Modern hotel with decent standard of rooms. Service was ok. You have to pay 10 euros for one day of wifi access, per device. A pretty archaic policy for a modern capital hotel. ",3,2012,09,28
213,Overpriced extras spoil nice hotel,"Stayed here for 2 nights and room and staff were great. Location is good and I would use again if the prices are looked at. Parking should be free for guests and not 10 euros extra, 10 euros for Internet when that should be standard, breakfast very overpriced at 19.50 and is not worth that at all. No tea and coffee in the room oh unless you pay the 10 euro charge of course. I have read responses from the hotel to previous guests saying inclusive packages are available direct through website but these things should be standard wherever booked like in other hotels. ",3,2012,09,27
213,Good but could be better,"Hotel reception staff were lovely. Cant say the same for the waiting staff at breakfast the following morning. Everything seemed like an effort as my husband asked for scrambled eggs on toast for me instead of a full irish breakfast, it seemed more of a chore than anything else. Over priced too. Needless to say we didnt stay for breakfast the next morning. 

No tea/coffee making facilities in our bedroom. Not sure if it was an oversight or it is simply not done in this hotel. 

Handy access to Dublin City and Ballsbridge area.",3,2012,09,25
213,It gets better,"Stayed here for a business trip, it was a very pleasant stay.  Its a lovely hotel with great staff I almost didn't come because of some of the recent bad reviews but I have to say I'm so delighted we did.  Its our third trip but it won't be our last.",5,2012,09,24
213,'Add- on' charges reduce this hotel to a poor rating,"The location in Dublin is very good & the breakfast is excellent BUT the € 10 to park your car AND € 10 euro to use the Internet definitely puts me off using this hotel again . In these days Internet should be part of the daily rate or no charge - not an extra € 10 a day !!! 
Charging a guest ,in addition to Internet charge, for an underutilised car park  is 'annoying' to say the least. Modern day hotel management and feedback should be checked by management of this hotel and reversed, It reminds me too much of 'airline's that add on charges. It's a no-no for me !!",3,2012,09,23
213,A VERY MODERN HOTEL IN DUBLIN IRELAND,"we stayed just one night in Dublin at the Herbert Park Hotel, it is a modern hotel in the Ballsbridge area so quite close to the City Centre, we found that arriving we had to pay 10 Euros to Park our car plus another 10 Euros for wireless connection plus the Breakfasts were very pricey for what was available, I dont think we will be staying there again",3,2012,09,20
213,Average room in an average hotel,"My wife and myself stayed in a double room for a night out dining with friends in Dublin. Although the rooms are on the small side, the hotel was clean and comfortable with friendly staff. We had the breakfast that was included in the room rate and it was good but nothing to write home about.",3,2012,09,17
213,"Peaceful, elegant hotel","I have stayed at the Herbert Park Hotel twice this summer, both times as I was attending concerts at the Aviva Stadium. I found the hotel ideally located for my stay. It is very comfortable, quiet and welcoming. In the surrounding area there are plenty of pubs and places to eat or corner shops to pick up essentials. I did not try any of the food at the hotel, but I would recommend their tea, they make an excellent brew. I would certainly stay here again and look forward too, hopefully in the near future. A very nice hotel, in a very nice part of town.",5,2012,09,16
213,"Very nice, if a little overpriced","Herbert Park is a really really nice 4 star hotel. Everything from start to finish is clean and pleasant. The staff are helpful and efficient. The rooms are spotless and very very comfortable. Lovely touch of free bottled water on arrival and ample tv channels.viewing. The bathroom was also spotless and just what you'd require. 

We didn't have breakfast included but did eat dinner in the bar/lounge area. This was really nice, even if not a very personable experience. 

Its hard to fault this hotel. Here are some things.... :-)
The wifi is not free, 10 euro per night. 
The parking is not free. 10 euro per night. 
The hotel is very impersonal, and there were lots of tourists about, and I felt it was lacking in any sort of atmosphere which would help them enjoy Ireland. 
The location is fabulous. 
Sleep quality was perfect.",4,2012,09,10
213,"Wonderful hotel, peaceful location","We stayed recently at the Herbert Park Hotel located in the Ballsbridge suburb of Dublin. The hotel was terrific in every way. Great restaurant and full Irish breakfast, extraordinary rooms[mine had a view of the park- ask for the suite in #409]. There are sufficient pubs, restaurants, and convenience stores within easy walking distance, but the hotel is in a very quiet and scenic part of Dublin. We really enjoyed our stay!",5,2012,09,04
213,"Big City hotel, not very personal but comfortable","Convenient location, 20 minute flat walk in to Dublin centre. 
Staff in Bars and restaurant are delightful but Reception staff a little aloof.
Do not let them book you a cab as they add 2 euros for the pleasure!
None the less, you get what you pay for and Dublin is expensive so this is a good stopover with clean comfortable rooms. ",3,2012,09,03
213,Pleasant Stay,"This was our third time staying at HPH. Each time has been better than the last. Situated close enough to walk downtown, far enough to be quite at night. We have two small children and the park connected is perfect to let them run around gettin' thier sillies out. Breakfast was divine, staff was impeccable. Parking is easy, area is quaint and not too touristy.",5,2012,08,31
213,This is where to stay in Dublin,"The Herbert Park Hotel is located in a quiet part of south Dublin close to the old Edwardian park that bears its name. 
The rooms are well appointed and  spotless, the staff friendly and the breakfast wonderful. For me, it has the added benifet of secure parking where I can leave my car and forget about it. I have stayed there many times and look forward to my next visit. The room rates and special offers make it excellent value. ",5,2012,08,30
213,Standard business hotel,"Stayed here on business. It did the jjob: efficient check in, comfortable rooms good breakfast. 

Had to pay extra to use wi fi. Many hotels are gradually getting the message that it's not ok to rip off the guests just to connect to the internet. Sadly thiswasn't one of them!",4,2012,08,29
213,Fab hotel,"I love this hotel the rooms are fabulous. My only complaint is that they included prosecco but they do not give u bottle opener in room so u have to ring down for it. But other than that its gorgeous the staff are very friendly and helpful at all times. The breakfast has a huge variety and is very fresh and good quality. A bit of a walk into the city centre but in a great location for the rds, aviva stadium. It costs approx 10euro in a taxi into town. Would definitely stay here again...",5,2012,08,29
213,"Very enjoyable stay, look forward to returning!!","We stayed in the Herbert Park Hotel on Saturday. We availed of the tall ships package. We were very happy with our deal which included bed, breakfast and parking. We arrived early and were checked in by a very pleasant member of staff. The concierge staff member called the lift for us and he too was very professional and friendly. Our room was comfortable and v clean. The only downside was no tea/coffee facilities in the room but overall that is only a small issue. We had some drinks in the bar that evening, again it's a nice area to relax after a long day. Breakfast was very good, staff are excellent here too and nothing  is too much trouble. The breakfast area over looks Herbert Park - which is an added bonus. Really impressed with this hotel, the staff that work there as well as the cleanliness of the rooms and all areas. Look forward to returning and would recommend to anyone.",5,2012,08,28
213,My favourite Dublin Hotel,"I rotated through Dublin 3 nights per week during Spring this year. I've stayed in lots of Dublin's hotels but this is by far the best ( much better than the Brooks or Trinity capital). Highlights for me are the breakfast over looking the park, the nice walk to St Stephens Green in the morning, the relaxing bar/lobby area, the gymn and room size!",5,2012,08,27
213,Staff never smiled,"I recently stayed at the Herbert Park Hotel with my 8 year old daughter as we were attending the Dublin Horse Show. The location is great for this however the staff never smiled, not even once! They were very efficient, but looked very unhappy all the time. It was an odd feeling and one that made me feel almost unwelcome. We attend the Horse Show every year and even though the location is perfect for this I have to say I would be looking for somewhere more friendly and enjoyable next time. Also paying €10 for WIFI is really steep in this day and age when most places offer it free.",3,2012,08,22
213,Still great year after year,"I book this hotel for my Dad every year for the Dublin Horse Show and it never disappoints.

The rooms are spacious and meticulously cleaned.  Breakfast in the restaurant is excellent and the food from the lounge menu (I have had snacks, lunch and dinner) never fails to impress.

Also the staff is really great, very courteous and customer service oriented.

I really think this is an excellent ""outside the city"" choice and for those of you who do not know Ballsbridge, it is a lovely suburb with great bars and restaurants and is only a short cab ride into the city centre.

You really will not go wrong by choosing this hotel.",5,2012,08,21
213,Helpful staff,"I arrived at the Herbert Park hotel after 24 hours of flying only to find that Delta had left my suitcase in the rain and all of the contents were soaked. The next morning when I realized air drying wasn't doing to work, I called the front desk for help. Everyone was very helpful in getting me sorted out, e.g. checking to see if housekeeping could dry my clothes, then calling me a cab to take me to a dry cleaner. They even remembered me a few days later when I returned for a luncheon thrown by my friend's mother. Very helpful and concerned staff. 

As for the hotel, the rooms are clean and not too small, the hotel is quiet, the location is ok, but I feel like it could have been a little cheaper given that it's not terribly close to tourist destinations per se. ",4,2012,08,21
213,lovely stay,"Stayed at this hotel for St. Patricks weekend with a friend.  As we had caught an early flight, we were delighted to find that our room was ready on arrival at about 10am (we had pre-arranged to leave our luggage with them until our room was ready).  The twin bedroom was large, and so was the bathroom.  From reading previous reviews here, I knew that tea and coffee making facilities weren't in the room - for this type of hotel I would certainly expect this.  It did have a minibar, but the prices were expensive, but I wasn't suprised!  Also had to ask for an iron and ironing board - again for the standard and price of hotel, I would expect this to be standard feature in the room.  Beds were lovely and comfortable.  The bathroom seemed a little dated, and in need of a spuce up, but it served our needs well and again was a good size.  The hotel staff were friendly and welcoming and nothing was too much of a problem.  We didn't try out the bar and food facilities so cannot comment on them.  Booked this fairly last minute, and was aware it wasn't a central as we would have liked, so we did rely on taxi's to get us into the centre of Dublin.  We did walk it a couple of times, but it was a bit of trek, and we managed to get lost!  Great location to the stadium though, and some lovely pubs nearby.  Minor quibbles really, as it met all the important needs of cleaniness and friendliness and facilities.",4,2012,08,17
213,still as good as ever,"Sometimes when you visit a hotel for the 2nd time you can be disssapointed, finding all the niggly details that you missed the first time. This is not the case at the Herbert Park. Its just as good as before",4,2012,08,17
213,Very nice stay,"Next to beautiful park and easy walk to dart and nice pubs/ restaurants make this hotel stay a great experience.  Clean room, helpful staff and nice breakfast the pluses.  The only draw backs I saw were hard beds, which the hotel alleiviated with additional duvet and the room doors that tend to slam shut loudly. Will definitely stay at Herbert Park if the opportunity arises.",5,2012,08,15
213,Hotel location,"Returned again to stay for 2 nights at the Herbert Park Hotel and had a lovely time.  Everying thing about this hotel is wonderful, excellent staff, great good and location is so restful being next to Herbert Park.  Can't way to return.",5,2012,08,12
213,Very Good Business Hotel,"I travel a lot on business and find this hotel caters perfectly for doing business in Dublin.
The location is ideal while offering the perfect setting for private meetings.
I have stayed here on more than one occasion and find the staff look after the repeat client especially well. The hotel offers quiet, well appointed rooms at a reasonable rate.
The only negative is the dated media system which I am informed are to be updated soon.",4,2012,08,11
213,"excellent location, spacious rooms, walking distance to the city center","Perfect location, safe area next to the US Embassy, spacious and clean rooms. Nice breakfast and dinner at the restaurant. It's 15 minutes walk to the city center or next to a bus stop which takes 5 minutes to th center",5,2012,08,09
213,Relaxing Herbert Park Hotel,"We recently stayed for 1 night in the Herbert Park Hotel & had a wonderful time. The staff are friendly & very helpful. We went for the Indulgence Package which we enjoyed, when we arrived we each had a glass of chilled prosecco served with canapes & relaxed immediately, the portion of canapes were small but just enough not to spoil our appetite for dinner later on. The selection of breakfasts was very good with generous portions, room service was prompt. The only thing we missed in our room was tea/coffee making facilities. We will be back again.",4,2012,08,08
213,"Friendly, welcoming, well equipped hotel","I stayed just one night at Herbert Park but would love to stay longer.  Very welcoming staff, particularly on reception, comfortable room and in convenient location.  Breakfast was good with good choice of hot and cold dishes.",5,2012,08,07
213,Herbert Park Hotel,I stayed here recently while attending the Madonna Concert & it is within walking distance to the Aviva so It is well worth staying here. We checked in & were impressed with our bedroom though it is strange to have no tea/coffee facilities I personally dont bother with them when I stay away but it would be nice to have the option. I know that they do deliver up tea/coffee to your room for €3.50. We had lunch here & it was divine & I felt good value also. However the staff are very rude & looked like they wanted to be anywhere but at work & this continued right through after the concert same attitude from different bar staff too. The only staff member that gave a genuine smile was the man at reception so it was no surprise that I saw on facebook or somewhere that he had been given a recent employee award he didn't have much competition that's for sure. It is embarrassing to think that this is the way tourists see our cead mile failte just because your a city hotel doesn't mean a cold atmosphere created by staff is acceptable. I would return again but It would have to be a good rate to make me.,4,2012,08,04
213,"Nice and quiet place to stay, but no *FREE* Wi-Fi.","I stayed at the hotel from July 22nd to 28th on a business trip. It is an average+ business Hotel, equivalent to the majority of other four stars hotels in the Country.

Staff was very kind and supportive. Room always perfectly cleaned and ordered. The hotel offers a very good restaurant with a good choice of delicious meals, but stay away from the bar food which is - obviously - cheaper, but quality of food is also affected. I had a burger on the Olympics Games inauguration evening and it was so stiff you could have used it as an ice hockey puck!

Last - SAD - note is: even if website room description and booking confirmation email both list ""internet connection"" in the room benefits, wireless or cable Internet MUST be paid, no matter what, 10€ a day! This is the only hotel I've been in EMEA which still asks for a fee to provide you with the Internet connectivity which should, nowadays, considered a basic service.",3,2012,08,03
213,Value for Money,"The reception was professional,friendly and helpful. I had a good night sleep in a very comfortable bed. Breakfast buffet was good with plenty of choice and high quality food. As mentioned in other reviews, location of the hotel is fantastic.",4,2012,08,03
213,Great location for the Aviva and city centre!,The walk to The Aviva stadium was just five minutes. Breakfast wasn't included in our package and we walked two minutes to Roly's Bistro for a gorgeous breakfast and good coffee. We had dinner in the bar/lounge area and it was good value and good food. Overall a good hotel - easy to recommend. Staff friendly and welcoming. ,4,2012,07,29
213,A really great professional friendly hotel,"A really professional hotel with friendly professional staff - compliments to management & staff. A great location in Dublin and a really great breakfast - fantastic value for money.
This was our 2nd stay and both times it was exceptional - will definately go back again.
",5,2012,07,29
213,"Nice hotel, good location.","Location, location, location...
Stayed here for 4 nights, including 2 concerts across the street at the RDS arena.There was nothing better than dodging the rain until the last minute before having to go into the arena and the same after the shows, strolling up the hill back to a festive after show gathering at the bar. The hotel did a wonderful job welcoming people into the bar with burgers and sausages for purchase. The hotel staff should be commeded for keeping the bar open for several nights to acccomodate the guests and crew associated with the concert.

The room...
It was clean and in good shape. A little light on the towels but it was no problem requesting more.
It was a bit difficult finding a plug to use that wasn't already attached to something but oddly we found one on the wall of the bottom shelf of the closet by the door. Glad I remembered to bring a voltage converter. It was a little unusual to find the hairdryer attached in the drawer with the holy bible, but it worked fine and I'm glad one was there although the holy bible did nothing for my hair...

The hotel staff...
Friendly and accomodating when we arrived before the room was ready. We left our bags with them and wandered across the street for some breakfast while we waited.  They followed through with the wake up call and having a taxi ready for us the morning we left for the airport.

I would say the only thing I would have liked but is not necessarily a reflection of the hotel but rather maybe a difference from the USA, is that concierge service is pretty minimal. They didn't really have any suggestions or helpful hints about deals in the city or the best way to get around etc. We had more helpful information from the taxi drivers. Speaking of taxi drivers, when the hotel pointed us to where we could hail a cab, it would have been helpful to tell us there was an ettiquette of which taxi to get in. It's not the first one you see but rather the one who has been waiting the longest. We ended up creating an angry conflict between 2 drivers and we had to explain that we didn't know there was an unwritten rule.

Overall a great stay.",5,2012,07,28
213,Nothing to write home about.,"I stayed here on Monday 23 July as result of a prize ; An overnight Indulgence Package in a Delux bedroom with a chilled glass of Proschetto served with canapes and breakfast the following morning and free car parking.
Our room was spacious but extremely warm, with an extralarge kingsize bed and a mini bar.Room was excellently clean with 2 complimentary bottles of water. There were no tea making facilities in the room which was a big miss so we had to get 2 more bottles of water from the mini bar which cost €2.70 each. In the fridge there was a 330ml Lemon, Lime and bubbles 7 up which was dated May 12. and a 330ml Heineken dated 07/2012 which should also be off sale. Had the Prochetto and 4 portions of canapes each which were tiny. Had a look at the dinner menu which seemed pretty expensive so we eat out. Breakfast was excellent with hot and cold buffet. The area surrounding the hotel was nice with a nice park and large water feature with wild ducks, swans and other species of birds. I wouldn be in a hurry back.",3,2012,07,27
213,Close to Aviva Stadium,We stayed at the hotel as it was close to the Aviva Stadium where we were going to see Madonna.  Despite increasing the cost of a nights accommodation for the event (a little profiteering in these days of austerity) the hotel was of a very high standard in terms of value for money and quality provided.  The room we had was fantastic and the full Irish breakfast set us up for the day.  It's possible to park at the hotel overnight but you will be charged 10 Euro for the privilege.  The hotel is close to a number of lively pubs and good eating places and I would strongly recommend Berlucci's if you are a lover of Italian food.,4,2012,07,26
213,"Nice, quiet hotel but no free Wi-Fi","The rooms and the breakfast buffet here were both really nice, we enjoyed our stay here very much.  Right next to Herbert Park, a great place to stretch your legs after a long flight.  A post office is just a block away.  Only negative was the hotel does not offer free Wi-Fi but you can get it just a block away at the Insomnia coffee shop.  This was the only hotel in Ireland that we stayed at that did not have free Wi-Fi.",4,2012,07,26
213,It's Worth a Visit,"I've stayed in the Herber Park several times, on business and with my wife. It is a quality hote, with clean, bright, airy rooms, and beds which ensure a good night's sleep! I like to have a kettle in my room, so that's one small 'downside', but the staff is excellent and courteous to a fault. The proximity of the park allows the day to start gently with a good walk - or just look out at the serenity from your room! It's adjacent to a lot of big venues, the new Lansdowne Road stadium for rugby and soccer, while the RDS is literally next door - so my wife and daughter merely crossed the road this week to enjoy a Bruce Springsteen concert.Such top-line acts and big games mean rates do fluctuate quite a bit, but the Herbert Park is a relaxing, well-managed hotel with a good range of catering options. There are good restaurants nearby - it is Dublin 4 after all! - and getting into the city centre is a 'breeze' (tip: leave the car behind, use the bus!). Sure, we'd like our parking free, and that kettle in the bedroom - but when I can I'll be back, willingly.

213,Great Value - Great Customer Service,"Upon booking Herbert Park Hotel for a midweek night stay - we were surprised at the value which was to be had with an excellent rate for room/ breakfast in bed & overnight parking. We were given a lovely room overlooking Herbert Park and upon check-in were also given a voucher to enjoy Proseco & Canapies in the lounge - a lovely touch which we didn't have time to avail of though!!
Overall - was very impressed with the staff, the service & the value. 
Highly recommended!!!",4,2012,07,19
213,Nice Stay,"Very good Hotel very professional and well-trained staff spotlessly clean excellent parking with loads of spaces (not included in the room price) 
Very professional well run Hotel lacks Irish atmosphere",4,2012,07,19
213,Lovely Hotel,"We stayed in the Herbert Park Hotel for the Paul Simon concert, having first stayed in June. 
I was with my brother and his wife and we all thought it very good.

The hotel is in an idyllic location, at the edge of Herbert Park. It is bright, modern and spacious with a nice lounge to relax in. The bedrooms are big, airy and comfortable. Yes, the Air Conditioning is a bit noisy, alright, very noisy. But then again, no more noisy than many other hotels I've stayed in. 

I have no quibble paying for parking, €10/day is not excessive for Dublin. I do think the €10/day charge for Internet Access is a bit high. I would have thought it could be provided free in the lounge area, at least. (It's the first time I've had to pay for hotel wireless in a couple of years!)

The breakfast is top class, as good as any hotel I've stayed in. Excellent choice of hot and cold food, served with a smile. If you've the time to relax and enjoy it, it really is a lovely dining area. We ate sandwiches in th lounge area and they were fresh and appetising.

All in all I would thoroughly recommend this hotel, for leisure or business. I cannot comment on the leisure facilities, as I didn't try them.",5,2012,07,16
213,a comfortable stay,"I made a return visit here this month.  It's a comfortable hotel wiith some good restaurants and bars near by.  Easy to get to the city centre by taxi, bus or a pleasant 30 minute walk.  
Breakfast is average and not good value, I would suggest getting a room only rate and try a local cafe for breakfast. Parking is extra, as is wi-fi and there are no facilities for tea making in the room.  However, the staff are pleasant and the rooms are comfortable.",4,2012,07,16
213,The Ryanair of hotels,"A hotel that takes a leaf out of the Ryanair book of money grabbing but at least Ryanair doesn't hide its acquisitive ethos beneath a pretentious veneer and i say veneer because the emperor truly has no clothes in this case. Be prepared because once you pay your flat rate they immediately begin to root in your pockets for every extra penny!! 10 euro for parking, 5 euro an hour for internet, extortionate rate for movies and extras, no tea and coffee in room but they offer it to your room and i quote  ""at a preferential rate of €3.50 for one or two people (free delivery)."" I actually brought the card for this information home because i found it so amusing. I would've been a little more forgiving if the desk staff weren't so curt, haughty, unhelpful and seemingly incapable of smiling. I realise that times are tough but is this really the way to go! Take my advice, if you want a pleasant stay in Dublin avoid this mercenary and unfriendly hospitality bypass!",1,2012,07,09
213,"Lovely hotel, pity about breakfast.",The hotel itself is in a good location. The hotel is well decorated inside and rooms are very nice. They don't provide a kettle for making your own tea and coffee so be aware of this. It didn't affect our stay as we didn't require it. The bathroom was spotless and was adequately stocked with the regular shampoo/body wash/soaps etc. breakfast was not included in our room rate and this costs 19.50 per person. If this is delivered to your room it costs a further 6.50 for room delivery. 46.50 is extortionate robbery for breakfast and the meal served itself was very poor considering the crazy price attached. We were also overcharged 6.50 for our breakfasts delivery. We paid 52 euro for breakfast but this (6.50)was refunded to us by the kind man on reception once we were checking out. I would recommend this hotel for the stay. I didn't personally see the food menu for the restaurant there or prices but if the breakfast price is anything to go by its worth going out from this place to eat. Plenty of places a stones throw away.,4,2012,07,08
213,How long will this hotel remain open?,"Stayed here for one night on the 3rd floor with a view overlooking the front of the hotel. Paid for the 'indulgence' package consisting of one nights accommodation, prosecco and canapes, parking and a late checkout of 2pm

Good Points:
- Clean ( except for around the tables at the bar )
- Convenient for embassy zone in Dublin 4

Bad Points:
- completely outdated TV in the room
- lack of towels in the bathroom, only one hand towel and one shower mat towel
- fabric on one of the chairs in the room worn down
- wallpaper peeling from the walls of the bathroom and bedroom in places
- abrupt and nearly rude service from one of the ( Irish ) staff at the breakfast service 
- No hot buffet at the breakfast service, something to do with a low occupancy in the hotel as grunted by the staff member mentioned above
- ""pancakes"" on the breakfast menu should be re-worded as pancake
- room keycards were not programmed correctly, had to go back to the front desk on two occasions
- no complimentary papers
- rude member ( Irish ) of house keeping staff banging on the door of the room at 12.30 on the day of departure to enquire about checkout, no "" Good Afternoon, apologies for the interruption... "" just a rude snarling of "" Are you departing today... ""
- single hand soap, shampoo, bath gel and moisturiser in the bathroom
- overpriced by about 30%",3,2012,07,03
213,Nice modern Hotel in a wonderful area,"The Herbert Park Hotel is a nice new, clean central in Ballsbridge, with quality pubs and restaurants close by. The hotel is built on the old Johnston Mooney and O'Brien Bakery site which backs onto Herbert park.
I chose the hotel as we ( my family ) had lived on the site between 1964 to 1969 when my farther was Bakery manager at J,M& O'B. The hotel is very nice the rooms are modern, the air conditioner is a little noisy.
The rooms have enough space to move around in, but as an Australian we miss having coffee in the room, I would rather have an iron in the room than a trouser press.
We did not eat in the hotel as there were more than enough local options close by, including an award winning restaurant 100 metres away.
All the staff we met were very friendly and a credit to the hotel.
I find paying for parking, Internet and coffee in the room an annoyance in any hotel.",4,2012,07,01
213,"Hostile staff, noisy airconditioning","Stayed here for 3 nights having booked & paid for the room in advance. 1st night coming back from dinner out locally, reception woke me up with TWO phone calls after midnight looking for more money for the contents of the mini-bar, I had not used anything from the mini bar.The next morning they pushed a bill under my door (I had paid for the room in advance) who does this??? Friends also staying at the hotel were refused service in the bar one night (it wasn't late and they were having a quiet chat amongst themselves not a rowdy lot) One morning room service barged her trolly into my room at 8.30am waking me up, I asked her to come back which she did 5 minutes later. Also the air-conditioning is very loud which kept me awake, the rooms are too hot but the windows only open a fraction making rooms very uncomfortable.The next unhappy episode was in the unhospitable bar area I ordered a sparking water and had to wait 5 minutes for them to give me a glass which I had to ask for! In general the staff were terribly rude, uncaring and hostile. Shame as the hotel is in a good location & the prices are alright but this was the most unplesant hotel I have ever stayed in, so much so that I looked forward to checking out, never to return.",2,2012,06,29
213,Nice place to stay,"This is an elegant modern hotel in a nice area of Dublin.
The mattress was firm.  I liked having the clock on the TV and it lit even when the TV was off which was nice.
The breakfast was the best we had during our Irish Explorer CIE Tour.  A wide variety and it was all good.
I can't think of anything bad to say except that it is not in the downtown heart of Dublin.",5,2012,06,27
213,Beautiful hotel away from center city Dublin,"The Herbert Park Hotel is a modern beautiful hotel in an attractive neighborhood in Dublin about a 20 minute walk from center city. I liked this location because it was in a neighborhood with beautiful townhouses and Herbert Park...of course. The lobby, bar and restaurant have great style and atmosphere.  The staff is helpful... I left my coat in the bar.  Five minutes later a staff member was at my door returning my coat.
The rooms are attractive and the bed was firm but still comfortable.  I really liked this place.  It just had a good feel...cosmopolitan yet friendly.",5,2012,06,25
213,Westlife Concert Trip,"As always excellent service, lovely room and friendly staff. Room price still acceptable unlike other Dublin Hotels who put their prices up for the concert. I find this hotel excellent and exceptional value and always stay here during my many trips to Dublin. Lovely location great for the Aviva and for concerts in the RDS or for shopping trips!",5,2012,06,25
213,Bad service from quite a sad hotel,"We booked this hotel through an internet website.  We booked an executive room so that my husband could have extra space to work as he was in Dublin on Business.  Where to begin - the hotel itself was lovely and the room quite spacious.  This is where the good bit ends.  I object to being taken for a ride.  15 euro for internet charges when you can go to the pub a minute away from the hotel or Starbucks which is also near to the hotel or even the buses in Dublin which have free wifi.  My next annoyance was when I asked at reception for an ironing board and iron.  I was told I could only have one when I wanted to do the ironing as this was on a rota basis and they would need it back.  Another issue was that there was no tea/coffee making facilities in the room, indeed they wanted to charge 3.50 euros to supply this.  Then there was the breakfast in your room issue.  They kindly gave a list of what you could order but no indication of prices - they were however very quick to point out that there would be a 6.50 euro charge per tray.  Also, parking charges were  10 euro per night and if ever you had forgotten your adaptor, as is usual in most other hotels you think you could get one by leaving a deposit - no at this hotel you pay 12 euro for a new one. Dear me, I know trade is hard in Ireland at the moment but all these extras just end up annoying people.  Even hotel groups like Premier Inns/Holiday Inns have some of the above as standard.

The reason I have put sad in my title is that we were there on the evening of the Euro Spain -v- France match.  We saw the first half from the pub mentioned above Bellamys.  We decided to go back and sit in the hotel for the second half.  The lobby has a lovely large area for sitting in with deep sofas and chairs.  Apart from three other people we were the only people there.  There was no one in the restaurant at all.  There was no music, there was also no T.V.  I think this hotel is missing the point.  They are situated in a lovely residential area and could offer so much to the local residents.   

Another point about the staff - I found them to be quite rude and cold.  I can honestly understand why locals do not go there.  We were not made to feel welcome or wanted even though we were spending money there.

Maybe some people would be happy to pay for this sort of service but I nor my husband will not.  As mentioned in a previous review there are many good hotels in Dublin at far more reasonable prices and with staff who are willing to talk to you and appreciate you.  Please see my reviews on Best Western Skylon and also Crown Plaza Northwood.",2,2012,06,24
213,Better than anticipated,Read the reviews before I went and if I had another alternative price wise I would have jumped at it. I was pleasently surprised by how nice the hotel was on first view. Very bright and modern. Staff at check in we're courteous and efficient. Room was spotless and larger than some I've stayed in with similar star rating. Breakfast was nice. Only small gripe was that as it was 10 and breakfast stopped at 10.30 ran out items were not replaced ie sausages and potatoe cakes. But the selection was varied. I was very happy with my stay and if I got another similar online deal would be more than happy to stay again. ,5,2012,06,24
213,"chic hotel, with lovely staff, beside a beautiful parkland","I love this hotel and stay here a lot. It is bright and full of light. The food is very good, breakfasts are especially delicious. The staff are very helpful and friendly. It is located beside a beautiful park, so even though you are within walking distance of the city centre, you also have the calming effect of nature. The hotel also does special offers, which are the best value in Dublin. I think it is one of the nicest hotels in the world.",5,2012,06,19
213,pleasant comfortable hotel,"i stayed here recently for work and  was very happy with the hotel. I have stayed in the past both for work and leisure and I am always happy with it. As a female travelling on my own for work I think the hotel is very safe, the food area in the bar is very nice and comfortable, although the price of the coffees even an americano is way too much. I would recommend the hotel and will go abck when I am in Dublin next.",4,2012,06,18
213,Great location but lacking in some things I would expect as standard.,"I stayed here recently for work for three days. While I can't quibble with over all standard of main hotel areas, the location, service, professionalisim of staff there were a couple of things which I found a bit amiss. I travel for work quite a bit and was surprised and not in a good way that there was no Internet connection in the rooms. You could get wifi for an additional 10euro a night which I felt given the cost of the hotel is a bit cheeky. Also there were no tea and coffee making facilities in the room but for an additional 3.50 it could be brought to your room. I noticed this sign after I paid 4.70 for tea in the lobby. 

The hotel corridors were uncomfortably warm too, granted I know there could have been guests from much warmer climates but genuinely they were sauna like!!

There is a gym which was small but functional down in the basement. 

Breakfast was generous and tasty. I had dinner one night and service and food was wonderful. 

My quibbles are minor but quite honestly they are small but obvious points which I would have expected of a hotel of this standing",4,2012,06,16
213,Relaxed business style experience,From an American perspective Herbert Park provided all the benefits of a luxury business style hotel with the friendly and helpful staff of a boutique style hotel.  I can't say enough how positive and helpful the staff was about every question or request.  The location at the park provides a great rest after busy day site seeing.  Resturant and bar at the hotel are very good and the pubs in the area are quite nice.  Rooms were well appointed and comfortable.  TV's could be upddated but we did not go to Ireland to watch TV.  Would highly recommend this hotel.,5,2012,06,15
213,Easy location and very nice hotel,"A very nice hotel, rooms are adequate sized and very clean. The bar area makes for a good meeting spot, since we were traveling with a large group. The breakfast is wonderful, esp. the Irish brown bread which was beyond compare, baked fresh. The area is convenient for light shopping, pub hopping or getting a quick meal.
Minuses: Just 2 glasses per room seems a little silly. Do you want to use the same glass for toothbrushing and drinking a soda? Shower leaks onto the floor no matter how determined you are to keep the floor dry.
Would I stay here again? Absolutely. Lovely hotel, lovely staff. Free w-fi would be nice (we got 15 min for free only).",4,2012,06,14
213,Great location and hotel,"I stay at this hotel on a regular basis and am never disappointed.  Bar area is good to meet people and the staff are generally very good.  My only concern is the level of heat in the rooms which leaves you with a choice of the room being too warm at night or having the air con blowing cold air straight at you which I personally don't like.

On all other basis an excellant hotel which is good value and has the added benefit of being close to many excellant bars and restaurants and the wonderful Herbert Park",4,2012,06,14
213,Business hotel without business standards,"The hotel is very well kept, service is very friendly and the food is ok even if the breakfast buffet is identical each day. The latter can be annoying if you stay a little longer than your business stay requires you to.

However coming to the status of a business and meeting hotel, I was surprised to see that all features come with an extra cost. Although you have access to a WiFi network it costs 5€ per hour or 10€ per 24 hours. Additionnaly it is not the connection time that counts but the hour starts with the first login and the access is limited to a single device. In times where business people use smartphones and laptops, and Pubs and restaurants offer free WiFi access this does not correspond to the standard of a business hotel. 

To get a power plug adapter (in case you forgot your travel adapter at home) you have to buy one at the reception for 14€... So far I made the experience in other business hotels throughout the world that it was always possible to borrow power adapters against a security deposit.",3,2012,06,04
213,Nice one if you would like to stay close to the RDS,"Overall a very nice hotel, clean & tidy. A little old though, no LCD's, slow internet in the room.
Room is fair in size. 
Breakfast was quite good, don't miss the soda bread baked freshly everyday. 
I could not stop eating it.
Located within 10 min walk from Simmonscourt and away from the noise.
Great bar next to it.",4,2012,06,01
213,Great hotel with lovely rooms and super staff,we have stayed in the Herbert park a number of times and have never been disappointed. Always had great service. Breakfast very good. ,5,2012,05,31
213,Worste experience ever...,"Everything is at an add on price. I'm not complaining for it, I'm just saying that these things should be clearly stated (and they are not). Difference between a third, fourth or fifth floor is non existent (you just pay more but can't understand why. 
Initially I though internet was included in my fifth floor (expensive) room...they told me it was written ""there's internet"" not that was included...on everything else there was a clear ""pay"" or ""at a cost"" when it was not included.
Next morning I went for breakfast (which I decided to include in my rate for a 12.50euro a day). They asked me if I wanted coffee or tea and I asked for a cappuccino...""yes, at an extra cost""!!!!! Unbelievable. I asked for the breakfast to be reimbursed and went to the insomnia coffee shop in front of the hotel (4euros for a complete and decent breakfast!) 
I gave two shirts to clean and asked to have them folded (it cost an extra euro to the hang version). I had to leave the day after and I wanted to keep them in my bag....they gave it to me on hanger! When i check out I had to discuss with concierge because they wanted to charge me full price as if the shirts came folded.
Never again!",1,2012,05,31
213,Almost perfect!,"The staff was very friendly and helpful from the front desk, restaurant servers, and housekeeping. The room was a very good size and very clean. We ate breakfast there every morning and thought the quality and variety was excellent as well as the service. It was in a great location! Right across the street from RDS facility. Very good restaurants and pubs around that area if you don't want to go to City Center. If you like to walk, it is about 20 minutes down to the center of town. The only 2 negatives would be that the room was a bit hot. That being said, we happened to be there when the sun was shining and the temperature was 78! Perfect for touring and being outside but it did tend to heat up the room. The biggest negative was that there was no concierge. The front desk was extremely helpful but a concierge would have been helpful in sorting out prospective tours and companies. All in all, an extremely wonderful visit. I would definitely stay there again!",4,2012,05,26
213,ideal for events in the RDS,"We stayed here for the rugby on 12th May 2012, the grounds are 100 yards from the hotel, the rooms are comfortable, clean and tidy with AC, the hotel is quite and beds are comfortable, the bar was busy and good atmosphere, there is a good choice of bars and restaurants, RDS, Aviva and city center are all convenient to the hotel, very safe area of Dublin as most of the embassy's are located in this area so very secure area.",5,2012,05,22
213,Stress Free Visits,"I have stayed in this hotel five times. As a traveler to Ireland from America, I can assure you that this is one of the better places to stray in Dublin. Having learned to stay south of the river Liffey this is the place. 
On a previous trip, I was forced to stay in another hotel near the Herbert Park and was unhappy during my entire stay. As a Leinster rugby fan from Kentucky, I can assure you that there is no better location for rugby at RDS than the Herbert Park Hotel. After rugby, one minute walk to the pubs. 
The staff has always treated me with a warm reception and housekeeping was excellent. I have eaten in the dining room for breakfast and it was very nice. I will stay there again on my next trip to Ireland. 
Thank You Herbert Park Hotel for making my visits to Ireland stress free. 

Patrick O'Donnell",5,2012,05,21
213,very enjoyable stay,"A very warm welcome on arrival. Free parking, canapes and prosecco along with breakfast in bed ans a late checkout, with the indulgence package. Wonderful value. A great base for the Pro Direct playoffs with Leinster.",4,2012,05,20
213,Easily the best 4 Star in Dublin,"Very well managed  with a warm,friendly highly trained staff. Did not eat in the Restaurant but availed of the excellent barfood. Bedroom of a very high 4 star standard and excellent standard of Housekeeping. I will be return.",5,2012,05,12
213,"Quiet hotel, quiet life!","This is not a ""happening"" hotel - if you know this then you are on to a winner. The rooms are perfectly clean and very adequate and the front of house staff are warm and remember you!. From a ""zen"" stay point of view, it has secure, easy parking and it does not attract noisy group bookings. This hotel is excellently located in Ballsbridge close to the Aviva Stadium and RDS. The city centre is a 15 minute walk or a 10 euro cab fare away. My tip is to book ROOM ONLY and  walk around to Roly's Bistro for your breakfast. Then have a relaxing walk around the adjacent park!",4,2012,05,09
213,Disappointing stay,"Having spent 2 nights at the Herbert Park Hotel I would like to give my experience of the service and food. I booked an Executive twin room on the 5th floor, confirmed at time of booking. When we arrived we were given the key to a room on the 1st floor and when I questioned this I was told that there were no Executive twin rooms on the 5th floor but that each floor has some such rooms. When we got to the room it had one large and one small bed, not twin beds. There was no dressing gown or any of the other items that were supposed to be part of the cost of an executive room. In addition the room was extremely cold. I called reception and one of the women at the desk came to the room and apparently 'turned on' the the heating system. We had to leave immediately but she said she would check the room in a half hour to make sure it was warm. When we returned at 11.30pm the room was still very cold so I again called reception. This time another staff member came to the room and told us that the heat had not been turned on at all. By about midnight the room began to warm up. In the morning I asked to cancel the booking for the 2nd night but was told I would still have to pay for the 2nd night as they have a 24-hour cancellation policy. We left for a business meeting at 7.30am and when we returned at 10.30pm we found a note from the Front Office Manager (the person who told us she had turned on the heating the previous evening) asking us to contact her. The result was that we were changed to a room on the 5th floor - with twin beds. My question as to why this could not have been done in the first place was not answered. With regard to the food - breakfast was of a very poor standard. The hot dishes were apparently cooked well in advance and were unpleasant. The service in the dining room was surly at best. I will never stay in this hotel again. Incidentally, we were charged at the rate of an executive room for the miserable room on the 1st floor, but, at my insistence, we got the room for the 2nd night at the lower rate. This raises the question: if I had not protested would we have been charged for an executive room for both nights even though the room and facilities were far short of the description on the hotel web site? This is a situation that needs to be examined by the Irish Tourist authority as it appears to be in breach of truthful advertising.",1,2012,05,08
213,"Excellent service, modern, quiet hotel","We had originally booked the Hilton Dublin through Expedia but were contacted 2 days later by Expedia to state that the Hilton had cancelled our booking!  (We are HiltonHonours members - but apparently it was the fact that we hadn't booked directly with them - they wanted to charge us more!)  We had already booked flights & tickets to a rugby match in the Aviva.  After a few hours of panic due to room availability shortage, Expedia sorted us out with the Herbert Park. Although we had wanted a city centre hotel, we had heard that this was a great hotel from relatives who had stayed there before.
Anyway, the room was larger than expected (certainly larger than the Hilton rooms!).  Service was excellent - we were checked in & out by Rummel who was professional & courteous.  Free newspaper, and nice bar area, with a great atmosphere.  A waitress even arranged to get food for us after the kitchen had shut.  The hotel is very close to the stadium, and actually only about 30 mins walk through 2 lovely parks & streets to the city centre.  Or just 10 mins on number 4 or 7 bus from almost outside the hotel.   
Over the road from the hotel, there are loads of nice pubs and a fantastic 'bistro' called Roly's just round the corner, which does a good choice of breakfast, lunch & tea options.    
Would thoroughly recommend this hotel, especially if you're attending a match or event at the Aviva - not sure I'd have the confidence to book through Expedia again though as this is the 2nd time this has happened to us through them, with 2 different hotel chains.  They blamed the hotel chain both times.",5,2012,05,02
213,Great hotel great location,"Great hotel for its location and room rates.Staff are great and rooms are large,bright,modern and clean. If possible pay room only and get breakfast elswhere. WiFi is charged as an extra which is the only negative.",5,2012,05,01
213,Excellent Location for a night in Dublin,"My wife and I have just spent another ""Overnight Indulgence"" night at the Herber Park Hotel, Dublin. This Hotel is very centrally located in the ""heart"" of Ballsbridge Dublin and is the ideal location for visits to the Aviva Stadium or the RDS.
The Overnight Indulgence offer comprises of Bed & Breakfast in a Delux Bedroom and one also recieves a Glass of Procesco in the Lounge.
The rooms are very well kitted out and are very comfortable. One can also have breakfast served in your room but then you would miss out on what we think is one of the Finest Buffet Breakfasts in any Hotel in Ireland. 
We also found the Staff to be very attentive to our needs and I would give Elga at Reception for her courtesy.
Yes we will be back again and have already booked for November when Ireland Play Argentina and we amy also spend a few more days there in the Summer.
I would have no hesitation in recommending this Hotel to Trip Advisor viewers.",5,2012,04,30
213,Enjoyable stay,Lovely hotel and staff very friendly. Breakfast was average and definitely felt lack of complimentary WI-FI was a disadvantage.,4,2012,04,23
213,OK for Business Trip,"Hotel was, in general, good, but there were 1 or 2 things that let it down. Firstly, the front of house staff are excellent, friendly. informative and very helpful. The rooms are good - very large bed, good bathroom with powerful shower, Sky Sports on TV, bar area relaxing and room cleaned to a high standard. The only 2 gripes I have is that 1. - breakfast choice, although good, the bacon and sausages were undercooked, no colour to them in fact the bacon looked as though it had been steamed, very unappetising, but the rest of the breakfast fare very good, cereals, fruit, croissants, toast and pastries. 2. The hotel, although it has a small gym, has no steam room or sauna - they need to look at this as this would really elevate it somewhat. Overall though, a good stay.",4,2012,04,22
213,Faulty towers robs you blind,"After looking forward to a nice relaxing night in a four star quality hotel I checked in to have a member of staff who was clearly stressed put through my credit card on 3 different occasions charging it to 209 euros before then telling me it was declined and then telling me it was to cover my room fee(109) and an additional 50 euro per person per room to cover extras,he did not inform me he was doing this until it didn't go through which is disgraceful  and  as I had that exact amount on my credit card only I was repeatedly told I was not to avail of any services unless they were paid on the spot which they stuck to as I ordered 2 hot chocolates to my room when restaurant closed which were minuscule and the waiter marched straight back to the room to make sure we paid cash upfront! The rooms were beyond basic, ancient tv, not even a bathrobe or slippers,not enough towels- no towel or mat to stand out of the shower onto, no tea or coffee making facilities, any of these requirements are of course available in the 'executive suite' really????!! Wake up you are a 4 star hotel!!!! I have stayed in the most luxurious hotels in the world and the most basic and the likes of premier inn have far superior rooms and services. Breakfast was just a disgusting extract of my hard earned money that left me fuming, the girl who "" served"" us was the most unpleasant miserable human devoid of any charm or personality, not only is the breakfast an outrageous 19.50 ( for panakes and maple syrup- which is one soggy pancake drenched in maple syrup and to get one more involved calling the restaurant manager and have him sighing and dictating that is the portion it comes as) but then they have the cheek to charge a further 4.20 as I had a latte instead of coffee!!! After looking through the other reviews and seeing similar experiences the most appalling thing is the attitude of the hotel management, never accepting responsibility for having terrible customer services and disguising blame in a series of sorry you 'felt' that way, if only you had brought it to our attention at the time- don't you understand it's too late when you have ruined someone's stay???!!! Don't patronize my review with a pathetic response as when I did give feedback your hotel  manager he just stared blankly at me, actions speak a lot louder so if you want to improve here's how - invest in some serious staff training or hire some who actually enjoy their job, review your ridiculous pricing and buy a few kettles and cups for your rooms. Kind regards.",1,2012,04,21
213,Nice hotel let down by very poor service and rude staff.,"I booked this hotel due to is location for work and arranged a discounted price as I had multiple staff staying for the duration of a project. 
On first apearance the hotel has all of the atributes of a first class establisment but DO NOT fall for apperances!  My problems started at check in where I was told that hotels in Ireland do not accept Visa debit cards and I had to pay for the entire stay up front, this was not a financial problem for me so I thought no more of it and paid in advance, the next problem came while I was entertaining a customer in the lounge.  A rather indiscrete member of staff demanded that I pay for food and drinks as I ordered them because they could not be secured on the room.  I explained that I had paid for the room in advance and my account was in credit so was left alone for a while but then approached by the desk manager who insisted that I paid ""Now"". Obviously somwhat embarressed I paid the bill and took the customer to a local pub where I recieved great hospitality and paid the bill at the end of the night from a tab secured on the Visa debit card.
I wrote a letter of complaint and was given an assurance that this problem would not happen again as well as the offer of free upgrades to the 5th floor exec rooms for all of my staff for the duration of the project.  I will report back on my next stay.",1,2012,04,19
213,Excellent Hotel,Stayed overnight recently having stayed here before. Rooms are excellent. Staff are attentive and the restaurant overlooks Herbert Park. Food is excellent. Ideally located for the south city centre area.,5,2012,04,18
213,Lovely Relaxing Hotel,"We have stayed in the Herbert Park quite a few times and have always loved it. The rooms are comfortable and the bar area is a great place to sit in the mornings with a coffee and newspaper, just so relaxing. It is a little out of the centre but there are some very nice restaurants in the area if you like to eat out and a taxi to the Temple Bar area or the city centre is around 10 euros. The staff are friendly and helpful, some more so than others perhaps, but we still love this hotel.",4,2012,04,16
213,Excellent Hotel,"We have been regular visitors to this Hotel for many years. We have stayed as a couple, as a family and enjoyed weekends with friends too. This Hotel is situated in Ballsbridge beside the Herbert Park which is an excellent setting at any time of the year. A room with a park view is a must,and definitely a walk or jog around the park is highly recommended. The busy town centre and popular Grafton St is a 20 minute walk from the Hotel, however taxis and local bus services are available if you prefer. Accommodation is of an extremely high standard. Rooms are spacious,light and airy.Cleanliness is also of a high standard.. Beds are comfortable as are the pillows which help for a good nights sleep after a busy days shopping! 
Breakfast at the Hotel has always been enjoyable with a variety of options to suit everyones needs. Food and service has always been of a high standard. Staff are always friendly and helpful.The availability of underground car parking is very convenient. We recommend a stay at this Hotel.",5,2012,04,10
213,Comfortable Night,"My basic requirements for an overnight stay on business are simple: quiet room & clean room, comfortable bed. The Herbert Park passed this test with flying colours. Conveniently located in Ballsbridge and a brisk stroll to my office, the hotel does the basics fairly well.

My only negative: some of the cooked items at breakfast left a lot to be desired. The bacon in particular was unappetising ( I suspect this was due to the way it was cooked rather than any problem with the raw ingredients ) and the scrambled eggs were suitably soft but lacking seasoning. The rest of the breakfast was fine - good range.

Would recommend this hotel to anyone with business in Ballsbridge who wants a quiet and comfortable place for a night.",4,2012,04,10
213,herbert park,Excellent location for both business and pleasure large rooms with great veiws of the park. Excellent service and value for money.,4,2012,04,01
213,"Nice hotel, poor attitude","The Herbert Park is a nice looking hotel, and my room was quite nice. I found the staff were unhelpful bordering on rude. 
I walked into the lobby bar in a pair of jeans, ripped, but designer, and a t-shirt and the look I got was priceless!!
Needless to say I went accross the road, found a nice pub, and a great Thai place for dinner",3,2012,03,26
213,Cannot fault it at all!,"I stayed here for two nights whilst attending a conference taking place in the hotel so I can't comment on the hotel's location as such. However, the rest of it is perfect. The rooms are a little old and chintzy but in a nice, comfortable way not in a tatty way. The food is wonderful, the whole hotel is clean and well presented, the staff are great etc. They charge for internet access which is a bugbear of mine and be warned that in most rooms it's wired access so make sure you take a cable or just borrow one from reception when you check in. The beds a big and very comfy and the rooms are a great size. The setting of the hotel is really lovely too. There is honestly nothing to fault and depending on it's proximity to the centre of Dublin I wouldn't hesitate to stay here if I were in Dublin on holiday etc.",5,2012,03,23
213,Love this hotel,"I stayed in the Herbert Park Hotel last night and loved every minute of it.  The staff were excellent, the food was extremely good and the room was fab.  All the little touches makes this a great place to stay. Everything is high quality (even the loo roll which is something you definitely dont see every day).  I was travelling on business but would have no problems coming back for a leisure stay, I am even thinking of treating my husband to a weekend in Dublin and staying at the Herbert Park. Highly recommend.",5,2012,03,16
213,Hotel for every occasion,"I have been staying at the Hertbert Park for many years. I mostly stay for work and sometimes for leisure. Great friendly staff and the hotel is always spotless from reception to rooms. Food is really good too. The location, in  Ballsbridge works really well for me and great for local restaurants and gigs at the RDS when I'm not working. The hotel is quiet and does not have a bar scene so won't suit everyone. But it makes up for that in every other area. It's a home from home for me. ",5,2012,03,15
213,One of the best sleeps I've had...,"What a fabulous hotel! The setting is grogeous in the leafy area of Ballsbridge - even my boyfriend who doesn't like Dublin very much said he could happily live there. The park is just on the doorstep and was beautiful to walk through. As for the hotel itself - great experience on check-in; we had an Executive Park View room which was stunning and so comfortable. We stayed for 2 nights and I must say it was such a pleasure to have a good night's sleep in Dublin without being woken by a lot of noise, and the temperature in the room was perfect - a major problem in most hotels. Breakfast was delicious with a huge selection of hot items, breads, cereals and juices - even smoothies available! We ate in the restaurant on our second night there and the food was excellent. Staff were professional and pleasant at all times. It has jumped to the top of my list for hotels in Dublin!",5,2012,03,15
213,Great hotel for quiet city break.,"Stayed here on many occasions and yet to be disappointed. Very nice hotel in quiet location but convenient to excellent local restaurants and pubs and not too far from City centre.
Would like tea and coffee making facilities in the rooms which otherwise are well equipped.",4,2012,03,03
213,Rugby Weekend,I was getting a rare weekend away with my Husband for the Rugby last weekend.My Friend raved about the Herbert Park and I must say I was not disappointed. The Hotel is bright and modern and the rooms are really comfortable especially the bed. The location is perfect for the fantastic Aviva stadium only ten minutes walk at most. It is also close to loads of really cool pubs and restaurants and a short hop on the bus to shopping heaven on Grafton Street. Staff are very friendly and helpful even the cleaning ladies.The only fault was the hotel was full so it was very busy but am not surprised because its a fantastic place to stay.,5,2012,02,29
213,Dublin's own inn on the park,"The Herbert Park is a stylish hotel in one of Dublin's most fashionable suburbs - yet only a 10 minute cab ride to Saint Stephen's Green in the heart of Dublin. It's bright, modern and comfortable and the staff are all very friendly. It's a privately-owned hotel, and you can tell the owners care about their reputation, and that of their hotel! 

The spacious lobby lounge is a great place to relax after a stroll in Dublin's historic Herbert Park, or a visit to the nearby restaurants, RDS Conference Center or Aviva Stadium. 

For us, the best feature is that the hotel is in an upmarket residential complex, so that means no weddings or late night parties to disturb your sleep!

The Herbert Park is our home-from-home when visiting Dublin.",5,2012,02,13
213,Perfect for the Rugby!,"Stayed here for a munster leinster game. The room was really nice, comfortable and stylish! Parking is underground which is great as you just get a lift up to the reception. We had to wait for check-in as they were really busy & got a free drink as a result...not bad! On coming down to head to the rugby in the Aviva we were met with the Munster team!!  Great hassle free stay! Breakfast was served in bed and late check out at no extra cost",5,2012,02,06
213,Lovely hotel excellent consistent service and good value for money food,Love this hotel when visiting dublin...exactly what it says on the tin...comfortable and friendly surroundings....great packages and great choice of good quality food... Freshly squeezed orange juice for breakfast and homemade omelette or pancake made to order.... Genuine authentic good experience...no frills needed ! Keep doing what you are doing because it works!,5,2012,01,29
213,Nice hotel in excellent location.,"I stayed at the Herbert Park earlier this week, on a business trip. The hotel is ideally located in an area called Ballsbridge, it's a nice walk into the heart of town. The Ballsbridge area has a number of shops & restaurants. I received an upgrade to the executive level and these rooms are spacious, well furnished and welcoming. There is a jacuzzi bath in these rooms, located on the 5th floor. Had a lovely view of the park & surrounding areas. The hotel represented good value, I had breakfast in my room and this was of a good standard. All the staff I dealt with were friendly & polite. Cocktails in the hotel bar were delicious.",4,2012,01,20
213,Poorest Quality Breakfast ever eaten,"Lovely lobby bar, lovely evening meal, nice bedroom, however the breakfast was a disgrace, worst lowest quality sausages and rashers ive ever eaten!",3,2012,01,14
213,Excellent package.,"We stayed in Herbert Park Hotel, Dublin over NYE.  We paid 130euros for 2 people in Executive Room which included a glass of champagne and nibbles in Bar.  Breakfast next morning in room, car parking included all in price.  The room was big and overelooked Herbert Park, just super. Staff were all lovely and served us well.  I would recommend this for a lovely romantic weekend.  Just across canal is RDS and Landsdown Road Stadium. We went to Rolys restaurant NYE as it was just acoss street and the meal was great, in fact excellent.  Only thing, I had read here that no tea/coffee making  in bedrooms so I took a small travel kettle.  Worked out well enough.",5,2012,01,02
213,Nice hotel,"We had a pleasant stay at  the hotel - the staff were friendly, welcoming and professional. Room was adequate, but bathroom on small side.   Location was excellent and the hotel had car parking facilities which we weren't charged for! The bar prices were steep which meant we went out for the evening over to Crowes pub where the music was in full flow - a great night out!  I would recommend it to all.   Overall a perfect hotel for a short city break.",3,2011,12,30
213,Pleasant enough,"Check in was a delight... the gentleman was welcoming, professional and we were delighted to be met by an Irish person on reception in a Irish Hotel. It is something that doesn't happen enough. Room was standard 4* room. Executive Floor room on 5th floor. No tea / coffee facilities in the room which was surprizing, however reception delivered a cuppa on arrival to the room. 
Comfortable nights sleep, room was fine, average 4* quality, wouldn't blow me away but wouldn't bother me either.  Breakfast however was a let down. Tea / Coffee served to the table, got the Full Irish ,sat down and realised that they didnt serve toast, had to go up and make my own, when I got back to the table, the Full Irish was cold. Toast should be served to the table with the tea or be located beside the Hot food, NOT the other side of the room.  Rashers & mushrooms overcooked and totally dry. Not one bit impressed with the breakfast.  Sorry.  Waitress were not too friendly either and there wasn't any sight of a restaurant manager. This hotel is good value though and I am sure I will be back at some stage.",4,2011,12,29
213,standards dropping,"this is a late review. we stayed in the herbert park in late august. this is a hotel we have frequented on numerous occasions and have always been impressed (on one occasion being upgraded to an executive for no additional cost). on this last visit we found that we had to pay for the underground parking and breakfast was not included but would cost an extra 29euro, something we had not realised when booking. i will have second thoughts when looking for accommodation in dublin in the future.",3,2011,12,26
213,Friendly staff make's your stay an enjoyable experience at that Herbert Park,"I have been staying in the Herbert Park hotel as a regular guest now for 3 years, I stay on average 2 nights per week. Before choosing the Herbert Park I had stayed in a number hotels in the area  none of which met my expectations. The key difference between those hotels and the Herbert Park is the quality of the staff. , The rooms are bright and spacious and are well sound proofed.  The staff at the hotel are both professional and friendly , they always go the extra mile to ensure my stay is a pleasant one. This is the key reason why I return to the hotel again and again.",4,2011,12,15
213,Avoid at all costs.,"Before I begin I’d like to say that I’ve always tried to be honest and understanding about every review I contribute to this site. If you look at any of my other reviews you will see that. We stayed here on Saturday night 10th December and it was a wedding gift from a friend of ours and I have to say this is the worst experience I’ve ever had in a hotel. The location is quite good as it’s in the middle of Ballsbridge and is only a short taxi trip to the centre of Dublin.  The bar area has the same atmosphere as an empty warehouse. I’m all for ultra modern open plan spaces but this was like drinking in an aeroplane hanger. The rooms are quite basic with good size bathrooms. We had planned a night out with friends in a pub just across the road and we came back to the hotel bar at 2.30 a.m. and asked for a nightcap only to be told the bar was closed. The manner in which we were treated was disgraceful. I had no problem with the bar being closed but there was no need for rudeness. We made the mistake of going for breakfast the next morning and boy what a mistake. If you like your rashers, sausages and eggs cold then this is the place for you. Breakfast’s are the simplest meals to prepare, in fact I’d say it’s harder to get a breakfast wrong than right. This was nothing short of atrocious. The people at the table next to us complained but after our experience the night before I knew they were wasting their time. We decided to check out early and put this awful place behind us but the final insult was yet to come. We were charged €10.00 for car parking which they informed us was standard. This hotel is a complete let down on quite a few fronts but its biggest failure is its staff. They are rude, unhelpful and seem unmotivated. The staff in a hotel or restaurant can make or break a customer’s experience that much I know. This hotel has a lot of work to do. Avoid at all costs.",1,2011,12,12
213,Excellent Hotel in a Superb Location with Great Staff,"I have been staying in the Herbert park as a regular guest for over 10 years.

The Hotel is modern and very well laid out. The location is superb in Ballsbridge overlooking Herbert Park and ideally located for Concerts and Rugby & Soccer matches as it is right beside the RDS and Aviva Stadium. Nightlife and shopping are also in walking distance. Good car parking facilities.

The staff are very friendly, from reservations to front of house and it is a nice touch to be remembered by name and an effort is normally made to ensure I receive a room with a view.

The rooms are spacious and quiet with large comfortable beds and good facilities.
Breakfast is always top quality and the dining room has great views of the park.
Room rates are very competitive for a four star. 

I stay normally as a Business guest but stay occasionally for leisure too and would have no hesitiation recommending the Hotel for city breaks and families as there are some very good packages.

Overall a top class Hotel, ideally located, with excellent facilities and super staff.",5,2011,12,11
213,Appalling,"From the moment I arrived to the hotel everything was all wrong. The prices were extortionate and quality didn't match the price. The staff were the worst I have ever encountered. I arrived to check in and my manager had booked three rooms as we were working at the R.D.S. He had booked the room with his credit card but because I had arrived first to check in they insisted on me paying for the room for the two nights plus a deposit. The whole thing with having to pay a deposit is embarrassing, they obviously don't trust their clientele if they think we were going to trash the room, you might understand if it was a group of young people on a crazy weekend in Dublin but not in a 4 star hotel aimed and catering for professionals and business people. I explained to the reception staff that my manager was paying for the accommodation and he would be checking in within the next hour but they refused to give me my room key until I paid the full amount up front. I asked them if they would speak to my manager over the phone to confirm his credit card details but they refused so I had to pay the full amount there and then. I appreciate if this is the hotel policy but I think they should review their policies in order to put customers first. Also the two receptionists I dealt with during this whole thing were rude and unhelpful, they just kept repeating their ""policy"" and wouldn't even consider my point of the issue. When I went to the room, I found it smaller than a room I had paid only €40 in Letterkenny two weeks previous, also there were no tea/coffee making facilities (as mentioned in most of the previous reviews). After I checked in I went to get lunch and when I asked the waitress if there were any tables for one she told me I had to join another person's table because it was full and she walked off, she didn't even attempt to check if there was a table free. The cheapest item on the menu was a bowl of vegetable soup €7.00, sandwiches and salads were €11 plus. I can't believe people agree to paying these prices, needless to say I didn't have lunch there. I had only been in the hotel two hours by this stage, not a good start. The following morning we were charged €80 for breakfast for four people, plus an extra €5 because one person in the party wanted eggs benedict (disgraceful in my opinion). For the rest of the weekend I just used the hotel to sleep and did my best to avoid having to deal with the rude and unhelpful staff, they all seemed like robots on overdrive with no personality or enthusiasm between them. I will certainly not be staying here again and advise anyone who wants a nice relaxing, hassle free stay in a hotel to avoid this place.",1,2011,11,28
213,Could do a lot better with client relations,"Room is only ok but, I found staff to be very rude and negative. They even put a 'please remove or we will for you' notice on my jeep while staying there. Quite expensive and they charge extra for everything. Won't be staying here for the rugby or horse show again",1,2011,11,23
213,"Comfortable, but at a high price....","In the current economic recession, one would expect hotels to discount their prices for food and beverage as well as the cost of accommodation.  Myself and my wife stayed 2 nights at The Herbert Park Hotel last weekend, as we were attending a ball in the nearby Four Seasons Hotel on the Friday night, and meeting up with some friends for dinner on Saturday evening.

Firstly, the positives....the hotel is superbly located, within a 15-20 minute stroll of the city centre. Likewise, the hotel is clean & comfortable, with a nice ambience. The kingsize beds our very comfortable. Herbert Park is a lovely place for a walk, and the hotel is located immediately beside this.

Now, on to the negatives......  

Check-In: I pre-booked/pre-reserved this online, but was notified by email that no money had been charged to my debit card that I used for the reservation.  I, like many people, no longer use, (or have the need to use) credit cards, except for foreign travel or car hire, and use my Visa debit card for just about everything else.

Upon checking in at the hotel, I was informed that they would have to charge for the full amount up front, on my card, as well as charging an additional €100 security deposit, refundable upon departure. I had no issues with this policy, except for the fact that I was NOT informed that I could not charge anything to my room, as a result of me paying by debit card (and not by credit card).

The latter issue was brought to my attention on the Saturday evening when myself and my wife ordered a drink from the bar, and we were told (loudly, in front of other guests, by an extremely unfriendly waitress), that ""you have to pay cash - room charges not allowed on your room"".

This issue really irritates me.  When I mentioned this to the reception manager upon check out, he simply said that room charges are not allowed without a credit card being used upon check in.  So, even though I had pre-paid, as well as paying an ADDITIONAL €100, I could not charge anything to my room?  ""No sir, the €100 security deposit is against the room"", implying that this was some form of security, should I decide to trash the room.  This policy is not good, and not one that I have encountered before.  The unfriendliness of both the waitress and reception staff also left a lot to be desired.

I like my coffee - price for an Americano in the lobby bar/cafe area is €4.25 (that is $5.72 or £3.65) - extortionate for a 4 star residence.

When we checked out on Sunday, the aforementioned receptionist did not even enquire whether we enjoyed our stay - another thing that really bugs me.

Dublin has many hotels to choose from - unfortunately, The Herbert Park Hotel is certainly not one I will be frequenting again, nor one I would recommend)
Bedroom: The only criticism of our room would have been the fact that there are no tea-coffee making facilities available, (although the usual minibar was present, offering a selection of soft & alcoholic drinks at prices that would even shocka Saudi prince). A previous reviewer mentioned that extortionate price to avail of the in-room Playstation facility (€8 per hour?) - fortunately, we didn't have our children with us, so this was a non-issue.",3,2011,11,21
213,Solid Hotel but be careful with extras,"Just back after having the Family experience for the match.
The hotel was fine with a great breakfast. Hotel staff deligent bit not entirely friendly.
Check in was painfull as a Blonde receptionist would not let us have the keys to the room as another guest had booked in already. I found this daft as the booking was in MY NAME. She said something about a credit card and thereby we were not allowed proceed until the guest Okeyed it......
On Checkout we avoided this girl and went through another receptionist who could not have been friendlier and was efficient as well. 
Sometimes it makes me think that these Hotels hire suitably qualified foreign staff who just do not have the same rapport as locals. These staff do everything 'by the book' and seem to exercise no discretion whatsoever. Unfortunately this hotel employs quite a number of this 'Straight- Jackets'. Thankfully our last interaction with a member of staff was a pleasant one and left us with a pleasant enough feeling to suggest that we will be back again.",4,2011,11,18
213,Clean and overall nice,"I've been staying here for a few weeks for work, and overall it's a nice place to stay, although details could be looked at.
The good: a huge park on the back, being in Ballsbridge (nice area), nice big comfy beds, and towels replaced every day without asking. Decent breakfast too with a choice of fruit, ham, toasts, sausages, bacon, eggs, hashbrowns, yogurts, cereals, juices, the lot.
The bad: prehistoric tv sets in the bedrooms, with extortionate prices for movies or playing with a (lol) Playstation 1 (8 euros per hour). No kettle/tea/coffee in the room. Furniture decidedly tired. No iron either, which is ridiculous considering most of their clients are business men in suit that need to have a decent shirt to wear in the morning.
The ugly: No wifi in the rooms apart from the 5th floor, of course paid for with expensive vouchers. There's a cabled connection at 10 euros per day (and you have to borrow an ethernet cable from the reception to use it), slow as hell and works when it wants to. This is not acceptable in a business hotel, especially when there are youth hostels giving free reliable wifi all over the place!
So, if they'd add an iron in the rooms and free wifi this could be an excellent business choice for a stay.
Top tip: if you go in the lobby, between the reception and the right end and outside the right end by the fountain there's coverage with an unprotected NETGEAR network. Works 10 times better than their official one, I guess it's broadcasting from a neighbour living around the hotel, let's hope it lasts as it has been my last resort multiple times.",3,2011,11,17
213,Bit of a rip- off,"I stayed here for five nights in October 2011. The rooms were comfortable and clean, however I think it is ridiculous that there is no tea and coffee making facilites provided in the room so that you have to pay € 4.50 for room service every time you feel like a cup of tea. I also could not believe the prices they were charging for wi- fi. You also have to pay extra for parking and breakfast I think was €20 extra so even though the room might be decent value, your final bill could end up being considerably more. Hotels may have got away with this a few years ago but I think asking people to pay extra for such basic requirements these days is completely unreasonable. I also found that although the staff at reception were professional, they were not remotely friendly or welcoming and could come across quite cold. On the other hand, the accomodation staff who clean the rooms were very friendly and did a great job. I think this hotel would be okay for business trips but for a relaxing weekend away or a holiday, I would definately stay somewhere else.",3,2011,11,10
213,"Nice hotel, shame about the details","I stayed for one night here, and felt cheated, due to a few small, but irritating issues.
- The TVs in this place are prehistoric.  For 119 euro per night, I would expect a decent telly.
- no free wi-fi.  What makes hotels think that wifi is an expensive luxury?  it should be part of the deal.  If I can get free wifi with a £2 costa coffee, I should get it with a £110 hotel room.
- Breakfast didn't start until 7, and the staff were very unhelpful if you wanted to get anything a few minutes earlier without paying the exorbitant tray charge for room service.
- no free tea and coffee in the rooms.  This really was the ryanair of hotels.  I'm surprised the toilet paper wasn't charged per sheet.

When will these places realise that their customers know when they are getting ripped off with all these extra charges?",3,2011,11,03
213,"Smart, modern, quiet hotel","Have stayed here for one night in October for the last few years, as a couple or with one child.  The foyer, bar, restaurant and rooms are very modern, elegant and comfortable.  The bathrooms are very clean and smart.  Service in the bar and restaurant were always pleasant and prompt.  The hotel is located in Ballsbridge, beside Herbert Park which makes for a nice walk around the lakes and ducks.  Ballsbridge is a lovely area, full of tree-lined avenues, grand old houses and embassies.  It's about 15 mins on foot through Ballsbridge into Grafton Street but you can get a taxi or bus very easily.  There are shops and bars across the road from the hotel and the RDS is just up the street but the hotel is set well off the road so the noise doesn't reach the hotel.",5,2011,11,02
213,Very dissapointing,Hotel lovely but lady in reception very unhelpful. Had issue with no tea or coffee making facilities in the bedroom and lady in reception unwilling to do anything to accomadate the issue despite informing her that I was a diabetic and needed the facilities in the room. Other than that the hotel was fine but this issue and the attitude of this particular member of staff would stop me from ever making a return visit.,1,2011,10,25
213,Watch out for the exchange rate trick!,"This is a hotel for people who aren't spending their own money. My room was quiet, comfortable and clean, but there was no free WiFi or tea/coffee making facilities and the prices for room service and items from the minibar were exorbitant. Don't stay here unless you have to and be very careful - as I was paying with a British credit card, they tried to charge me in pounds sterling. I suppose the excuse would be ""Many guests prefer this, as they know exactly how much they are spending"", but I am familiar with exchange rates and prefer the one offered by my credit card provider, thank you.",2,2011,10,24
213,Excellent quality within easy reach of the RDS or Aviva Stadium,"I stayed here while working a show at the RDS. Its an easy walk from the showground. it would be equally good for the Aviva Stadium. It couldnt be easier from the airport with the coach stopping just a few yards from the door. It's a bit far out for easy access to the city centre but you can get a bus, cab or tube. 
The hotel is a nice modern style with great rooms. The bed was comfortable and bathroom excellent. Staff are fantastic and friendly. The breakfast buffet was very good and set me up perfectly for the day. I didn't eat in at night but there is a limited selection locally including a great cafe/bistro. There are also a couple of good bars directly over the road. 
It's not cheap but certainly the going rate for this level of quality. I've paid more to stay in places that can't touch the Herbert Park Hotel. 
Would definitely stay here again.",4,2011,10,11
213,"Good hotel, but Dublin has much better places to offer","I have been a regular guest of the Herbert Park Hotel since it was opened in the 90', as this is one of the hotels used by my organisation. It is a good hotel in a very up market location (Ballsbridge). However I always found it too cold and impersonal. Nothing terribly wrong with it, just lacking atmosphere. The staff is professional, but not particularly friendly. My last stay was at the end of September for four nights. This time a got a room in the second floor in the front of the hotel. No view at all and a lot of noise from the air conditioning units just on the roof just outside my windows (at least the rooms in the back have a nice view on Herbert Park). However the main problem was that in the whole room there was not a single standard UK plug that I could use to recharge my phone. I had to search for the plug used by the internet router (under the desk) and unplug the router. Luckily on this occasion I did not have my notebook with me.
Breakfast is good, but average for an Irish hotel. There is not a real pub in the Herbert Park, but just a bar, again not exactly what you can expect in an Irish hotel.
Overall the Herbet Park is a good business hotel, but when I can choose where to stay in Dublin, I do not go for the Herbert Park.",3,2011,10,07
213,No Kettle!,"Couldnt believe that when we stayed in the Herbert Park for a family wedding there wasnt a kettle in the room (an executive suit we were told). When we asked at reception for a kettle we were told NO, but we could order from room service, but, who wants room service at 3am when you cant sleep, or that early morning cuppa. This lets you down Herbert Park, you were good on everything else and very accommodating, but I couldnt recommend you, and all because of a kettle.",2,2011,09,26
213,COME ON GUYS,"Come on Guy's,

When you pay 100 pounds for a room you expect there to be tea & Coffee making facilities.
\
Its nice to wake up in the morning & relax with a cup of tea or coffee before facing the world  ....

This is not good  ... When i broached the subject with reception, I was told  ""No we do not do tea & coffee making faciliies in rooms  .... However you will be delighted to know that there is no service charge for bringing a tray to your room ..."" 

Now come on guys have you ever heard of a statement that is so far out of touch with peoples basic reqirements.

This sort of penny pinching just alienates customers  .. hence this note....",1,2011,09,25
213,Nice Hotel & Excellent English Breakfast in Ballsbridge area,"I recommend the Herbert Park Hotel in Dublin Ireland.  It's close to the U.S. Embassy and has several pubs/dinning options within walking distance of the hotel.  Also, its a short cab ride to downtown as well. I found the Hotel to be clean and fresh in appearance and the staff was friendly.",4,2011,09,12
213,Expensive for what it is.,"The hotel is well situated in Ballsbridge and particularly convenient for the RDS and Aviva Stadium. Herbert Park is adjacent to the hotel however I didn't have the time to explore. It's also convenient for city centre as plenty of buses pass near to the hotel.

I stayed in an Executive room and the room was comfortable, however the bed was a little on the hard side for my taste. The welcome coffee served to the room was a nice touch. However, it is quiet and a good night's sleep can be enjoyed.

Breakfast was nice and included in my rate as was the parking and a newspaper of choice in the morning.

It's been a long time since I stayed in a hotel where the shower was in the bath and it's something which I don't like and was surprised to see.

The staff were friendly and helpful albeit on checkout the girl asked me to pay for parking until I reminded her that it was included in my rate. 

I had a good experience here but I thought it was expensive at €150 per night.",4,2011,09,12
213,Very poor customer service and average rooms for the price.,Do not stay in this hotel there are hotels nearby that offer a better standard of service and facitilies for a better price. There are also no tea or coffee facilities in the rooms. ,1,2011,09,12
213,We loved that place and we'll be back for sure!,"I loved every minute of our stay, the staff  were amazing, catered for our every need (we were travelling with a small baby). I would recommend this hotel to anyone. Perfect location, just next to a beautiful park and it's only 15 min, away from the city center. Service in this hotel is fantastic in all areas.",5,2011,09,02
213,Always a pleasure,Perfect for business stays...plenty of choice for breakfast and staff very attentive and accomodating...very close to city centre and main motorways.,4,2011,09,02

213,A nice property completely let down by appalling customer service,"Our stay could have been really nice...... The Herbert Park hotel is a beautiful property (by Dublin hotel standards) large, modern rooms- tastefully furnished and well maintained .  Great location - walking distance to Ballsbridge restaurants/pubs, right next to Herbert Park perfect for a walk or jog (be advised it closes at dark so in the winter you have to get there before 4pm!), really nice breakfast (if you pre-pay on line it's cheaper than paying in the restaurant) and the hotel was offering very competitive rates.  

BUT.... the staff must have been sent to a ""boot camp"" to brainwash them to be so inflexible, inhospitable and arrogant.  I'm writing this review 2 months later and still am annoyed about the stay.  

The highlights of my encounters with the staff include being told that I couldn't take my lunch up to my room from the lobby (to deal with my son who had started wailing).  I was told it was ""The Rules"".... no flexibility what so ever.  Being told that no outside food or beverage could be consumed in the lobby  (Starbucks anyone?) - ""it was The Rules - they had a on site restaurant"".   My husband wanted to have a friend join him for a drink in the bar lobby when we had put the baby to bed and he was told that the police would be called if he didn't leave at 11PM.  When I asked to have my son's bottle sterilizer put in the microwave - I had a raised eyebrow from the waitress and told she wasn't sure if it was allowed and I said ... ""sure it was The Rules""  (BTW- Roly's Bistro around the corner was extremely accommodating and has great take away meals and pastries).  

After a weekend of being told what I couldn't do (and I was paying for this!), I was asked how my stay was at checkout.  I told them of my frustration with the service citing all the incidents above. I had 3 staff staring at me saying that they disagreed with me and that they had to do such things to maintain the quality of the property. I suggested that instead of starting off by saying ""The Rules don't permit ...."" it would be much better received if a win/win solution or employ compassion and try to make the customer happy.  I got blank stares back from the staff.   If you are a business traveler with no special requests, no non-resident friends and are on expense (to cover all the extras ....everything is extra)  this is a great place but other travelers should explore other alternatives first.",2,2011,08,30
213,Average,Was really looking forward to staying here. Overall though a very average hotel. No atmosphere even though we were there during an international rugby weekend. Did not like the fact that Internet and parking are not included in your booking price.,3,2011,08,29
213,"far to expensive, receptionist not helpfull",i stayed here with a friend last Saturday night. my usual hotel in city center was booked out. as were all the city center hotels due to a rugby match that was taking place beside this hotel. so should have been a good indication the fact that the Herbert park was not booked up. when we arrived we just wanted to drop our bags to the room and head back into town but the girl at reception kept us for twenty mins and was unhelpfull . it cost us a further 13 euro to get a taxi into town and funny enough only 8 back later that night. we said we'd have a drink at the bar before bed. there is no atmosphere in the bar is like an airport lounge. and when i was going to bed i asked for a large water and it cost nearly 6 euro. our room was tiny and a bit shabby for the price as this hotel cost us more than a 5 star in the city center. i think they up the prices because of the rugby match.on check out i had to pay another 10 euro for parking. i don't Monday spending a few bob but this hotel totally ripped us off.,2,2011,08,24
213,"Lovely hotel, excellent location and service","Having just stayed at the Herbert Park with my husband (who is currently working in Dublin 3 days per week and is a regular at the Herbert Park) I can't understand the negative reviews at all.
Herbert Park is in a good location in a quiet suburb of Dublin, less than a 5 minute bus ride from the centre or alternatively a 25 minute pleasant walk .
The rooms are very spacious, immaculately clean and the only complaint would be the lack of tea/coffee making facilities, as previously mentioned.  
The food (both breakfast and evening meal) is of a high standard with plenty of choice.
All the staff are very amenable and friendly, particulary Maeve the Bar Manager who went out of her way to make us feel welcome and gave us tips on the local area.
I thoroughly enjoyed my stay and look forward to visiting again soon.",5,2011,08,18
213,Pleasant hotel...,"I stayed at the Herbert Park Hotel in April this year while on business at a show in the RDS. The hotel is obviously ideally located for anyone working at a show at the RDS or on business in Dublin as it is centrally located. 

The staff were pleasant and accommodating. The room was spacious and clean, of a good high standard. I had a pleasant stay at the hotel and would recommend to business travellers in the future.",4,2011,08,16
213,Will come back-BUT,"The trip etc was fine BUT to charge 10 Euros PER NIGHT for car parking is a bit of a rip off.
Come on Herbert Park,drop it!",4,2011,08,12
213,A cold welcome awaits you,Actually visited an important friend who was staying with his wife in the hotel. He asked me to join him in the empty bar - Thursday evening. We were treated extremly badly by staff who worked for Herbert Hotel PLC - there was no concession given on their part regarding a stupid matter of a second pint of Guinness after 11pm.....I was emarrassed for my friend who was treated so poorly. This 'luxuary' hotel reeks of the RyanAir modus operandi - dont forget to read your terms and conditions as the staff are not programmed to show any compromise or hosptality. Bad show Herbert Park PLC,1,2011,08,11
213,Very pleasant,"Stayed there with my wife and five children for one night on a midweek visit to Dublin. We had two adjoining rooms. The hotel was really nice, clean, comfortable with pleasant staff and in an excellent location. The lovely Herbert park is literally right outside the hotel door and the RDS & Aviva stadium are just two minutes away.",4,2011,08,11
213,"Nice Hotel, Friendly Staff, Good Food","We stayed in this hotel for the Dublin Horse Show, I thought it was a very nice hotel (we normally stay in Bewleys), I found the staff to be quite pleasant especially the receptionist I think her name was Christine, she was more than helpful with us.  We arrived early in the morning and she stored our bags for us until we came back later that day.  Our room was a good size and was very clean.  The bathrooms are very small but functional and most importantly it was clean.  We had breakfast included in our rate and it was lovely, we also had dinner in the hotel and while it was very tasty it was quite expensive and the menu choice was very limited.  My main grievance was when we arrived, breakfast was over in the hotel so we choose to have tea/coffee and a scone, this cost €16.60 for two of us.  Now in the good old days this may have been the price for such a small snack for two people but in the current climate I feel this hotel needs to revisit its prices for food.",4,2011,08,09
213,"Awful: Ireland at its worst, don't book any business visitors to stay here","A great location and reasonably nice property is let down by an inflexible, unhelpful management team whose only purpose seems to be to screw every last penny out of their guests - someone needs to remind the staff here that it is no longer 2007.

We were staying with a small baby and my wife wanted to grab a salad and take to the room. The staff insisted that this wasn't possible and that it needed to be ordered from room service and that a 6.50 plate charge must be incurred. When she offered to take up herself, she was told this was not possible on health & safety reasons (yes, for a salad). There was just no leeway for someone with a small baby or any attempt to be flexible - it just seems that the wanted to screw every last penny out of their guests with quite a rude disposition. 

Due to the baby, I had arranged to meet a friend I hadn't seen in a long time and arranged to meet him in the almost empty lobby bar. We had one drink and at 11.30 we were told that only I could be served a drink and that he could sit and watch. After a short while of this, he was then told to leave. No leeway, no compromise just an over zealous manager who doesnt know what hospitality is. I have no ideas what you would do if you had business guests staying here from overseas - I have never encountered such a lack of hospitality in any hotel I have stayed in and it just seems the management have removed the ability for any form of empowerment or judgement amongst their staff.  (If you do put people up for business then use the Four Seasons or Bewleys both of which are pragmatic and reasonable and would never dream of the shocking service at Herbert Park Hotel).

Everything is extra and bad value here -  five euros for a cup of coffee while you wait for the restaurant to open, overpriced slow internet service, complicated parking with a buzzer that doesn't work at the gate. The whole place is a mess with rude and ignorant management (although to be fair there were a few exceptions such at the breakfast staff and Brian the barman).

so, If you do plan on staying here then make sure you don't need to make any changes or require anything beyond a room. The location is great and you can make the most of things through getting take away meals from the fantastic nearby Rolys Bistro (who have an excellent take out option for less than the plate charge!), bring your own drinks, park on the street and use the internet at the nearby Starbucks.

Any of the nearby hotels are much better than this and the sad thing is that the staff who work there realize hospitality is more than just sticking to rigid and inflexible rules.  

Awful service from dreadful management letting down an otherwise nice building.",1,2011,08,08
213,"Good hotel, a few small improvements could make it better","I have stayed at the Herbert Park twice on business trips duing June. The hotel is in a lovely area of Dublin, and having the park on the doorstep is a real benefit (weather permitting) First impressions were very good, huge clean lobby area, and a warm welcome.  Room allocation was quick and efficient.  As this was a business booking made by an agent I wasn't aware of the 'pre auth' payment on the card, nor was I made aware of this when handing over my card.  I was left wondering why I'd been allocated such an expensive hotel when we are constantly being asked to reduce travel and accomm costs !  Obviously the price was nearer what I expected on check out.  

My room was large and clean on both occasions although the bathrooms are ready for modernisation.  Comfortable bed and pillows, a few toiletries provided, good selection of TV channels. Nice view and quiet.  My room was opposite the lifts but I wasn't disturbed by other guests or slamming doors.

I ordered room servive on a couple of occcasions which arrived promptly, and the food was hot.  The lobby and lounge/bar area is light and relaxed atmosphere after work, and the service was good.  Check out was fine although the one receptionist did seem a little overworked with guests checking out and taking telephone calls.

The few niggles which stop this hotel getting full marks in my opinion,
1)  There is no iron in the room, this was provided promptly by housekeeping on the first stay, on the second stay I asked for it as I checked in.  
2) There are no tea/coffee facilities, I know you can order a coffee and there is no tray charge, room service experience suggests it'd arrive promptly, but you don't always plan to fancy a drink 10 minutes in advance !  
3) No complimentary water in the room either.  
4) My room rate didn't include breakfast, and even on expenses 15-20 Euro for breakfast seemed OTT.  The breakfast choice was very good, definately something for everyone, and if you were going out for the day sightseeing you probably wouldn't need lunch, but I couldn't justify the price for some cereal and toast - you even have to plan wanting some toast in advance as the toasters are in need of replacement and take forever !  
5)Charges for wi fi /internet have been noted in other reviews.  

As I said, these are just niggles, my two stays have been very good and I would stay here again.  I would recommend especially if you get a room rate inc breakfast.",4,2011,08,01
213,A liitle extra and this hotel could be a lot better,"We stayed here in July 2011. 2 adults plus 2 kids. The plus side the rooms were adjoining via double doors so great for the kids. The location in D4 is superb. Underground car park also great. The downside is the views from some of the rooms are shockingly bad! We were facing into a brick wall! Hardly what you expect from a 4**** hotel. We paid a lot of money to stay here so we were not very pleased with that, especially when you look at the website you see the beautiful views over herbert park. Perhaps the lesson here is to insist on getting a good view when booking. The breakfast was ok but very expensive. for the four of us it was 80Euro. The previous night we had a very nice 3 course meal in the upmarket roly's bistro, including a good bottle of wine for 85 euro. This shows how expensive the breakfast was. The decor of the hotel is nice, if a little on the cold side, but that is ok for us. The bar was not very cosy, but who would stay here when you have better pubs nearby. It seems to me that they have a lot going for them in this hotel, especially the location, and with an extra push they could be a top hotel. I would ask the manager to visit the Hotel Rival in Stockholm to learn something.",3,2011,07,29
213,Great value hotel in a great location,"I've stayed in the Herbert Park hotel many times and never took the time to write a reveiw until now.
What prompted me this time was that the check-in staff had my name before I opened my mouth!!

It's a very good value hotel with fine rooms and very convenient to sports venues, pubs and restuarant. It i also a 20 minute walk to the centre of Dublin.
It is beside Herbert Park, which in fine weather, is a lovely space to spend an hour.

This hotel is friendly, spacious, but low key. You won't find stag or hen parties here. All rooms have tv's with Sky Sports which is a real bonus for the sports enthusiast.

They do charge €10 a day for parking, but look out for inclusive deals.

One down side is that if you're on a room only basis, breakfast is expensive.

I always return to the Herbert Park Hotel",4,2011,07,29
213,No flexibilty regarding the cancellation policy,The management did not show any flexibilty or understanding regarding a last minute cancellation due to a personal misunderstanding. The result is that we paid for a room that we did not occupy.,1,2011,07,26
213,last time i would stay!,From check in.... a €405 deposit was taken out of my credit without my consent ....to check out which left me stuck at hotel barrier due to the must unhelpful receptionist....rooms ok….food ok…..better hotels and locations in Dublin…would not recommend or stay again …………,1,2011,07,26
213,AVOID! If Ryanair was a hotel...,"This has to be one of the most disappointing hotels we have stayed at. Every encounter with the staff took the hotel down one more notch. We arrived in Dublin to go househunting and this hotel was chosen for us by my husbands's assistant as she thought it would be a good, family friendly place, close to where we were looking at houses. 

On arrival, no one is at the doors- staff inside will watch you quite complacently while you drag your luggage in piece by piece. We called ahead to request early check in as we were travelling with our 22 month old daughter. We were assured we could have it but on arriving after an early flight with a cranky child, we had to wait in the lobby for close to 2 hours. They said that this was because they were trying to give us a larger room. When we finally got to our room it looked very much a standard hotel room size (what was the earlier room, a matchbox?) 

The ryanair bit- everything in this hotel has a charge- if you order a meal you pay a tray charge of 6.50 euros per person. With two people staying in a room, if you order breakfast and pay a 13 euro tray charge it very nearly costs as much as a full breakfast. I'm not particularly penny pinching and I believe in paying for good service or value but this provded neither. Internet is charged (but then to be fair it is at most Dublin hotels) at either 15 or 20 euros a day per device. With my laptop, my husband's and both our iphones needing to be connected- well.. On my next visit to Dublin we stayed at the Four Seasons which I found to be better value- a flat tray charge of 5 euros, cheaper food which was much tastier, package internet of 24 euros for 4 devices and they upgraded us to a junior suite at no extra cost- no comparison really! 

The food was indifferent too, served by grumpy staff who were annoyed at having to wait a minute or two outside my door (with a trolley) after showing up 10 minutes before the time I requested my breakfast. Staff in the restaurants were rude and off-putting. I asked for a high chair and received one about 15 minutes into the meal (which we had a 45 min wait for) after the staff had served everyone else who came in much after us. The high chair was dirty and broken too. 

Each interaction with concierge or reception took the hotel down a few more points. I rang concierge to ask if there was anything I could do on a wet day with my little girl only to be told that apart from taking her to the mall, there was nothing really! The RDS is next door and had a lovely exhibit on I later found. A complete lack of imagination on their part and a waste of a good afternoon. The front desk staff seemed to be nice to some guests and I had the impression that they had to take a liking to you for you to get good service. 

The only thing that is really nice about this hotel is its proximity to Herbert park where children can have a nice run about and feed the ducks. Otherwise, Avoid, Avoid, Avoid! I wouldn't stay there again if it were the last hotel in Dublin.",1,2011,07,25
213,Clean but ohhh so unfriendly !!,Great location in ballsbridge. Food and rooms were good but we had one issue which started out small but was dealt with in such a poor manner by staff and management that it ruined the family night out for us.,3,2011,07,19
213,Very poor value for money,"Reception staff were pleasant. The room, while clean, was basic with bath/shower combo. The bed was basically 2 beds loosely shoved together. The a/c was noisy & smelled badly. The room was interconnecting even though we didnt request this & we had to talk in whispers to avoid disturbing the neighbours. (We could hear their comversations plainly) The hotel decor was lovely, however, we paid e230 for a room only & this was very poor value for money as the room was so basic.",2,2011,07,18
213,Just about right,"I was here as part of a business trip.  The hotel is well situated and a lovely park just out the back. Room was nice and contained everything you would expect from a 4 star hotel. Clean and comfortable. Breakfast was great and included in the price which was not overly expensive. Good bar. All in all this hotel is great, serves its purpose and I would go back.",4,2011,07,17
213,Can't imagine a better location as a base for seeing Dublin.,"In terms of location, it's hard to imagine a better center of operations for a short stay in Dublin. ""Dublin 4"" (sort of like US zipcodes) is one of the best sections of town and seemed very safe and clean. Many of the major tourist destinations--the National Gallery, Temple Bar, Grafton Street, Trinity College, etc--are within a short walk or a relatively cheap taxi ride. The neighborhood immediately surrounding the hotel contains fine dining establishments, pubs, ATMs, bus stops, cool bistros, convenience stores and the American Embassy.
   My wife and I stayed three nights in June and the hotel exceeded our expectations in every way and made for a very pleasant stay. The hotel is adjacent to Herbert Park, a tiny gem of a park and practically part of the hotel grounds--a nice bonus. Our room was large and clean, with a couple of nice eco-touches. There is no free wi-fi in the rooms, but that proved to be less of a problem than we expected.
   The staff at the front desk was superb--exceedingly helpful and friendly. We'd stay here again and will recommend it to our friends.",5,2011,07,11
213,NEVER EVER,"This Hotel is a joke.
I booked the Hotel by phone.I stayed there 1 night.
Room was OK,can't complain.Location was described close to city centre,by taxi expect cca 20min because of traffic.
What surprised me was the fact that you have to pay for all extras.Internet is €10 p/day,(shock!).I could accept this as long as you get really good value but not in this case.
The breakfast was €20 extra p.p.What is more,there is no restaurant open at all!We wanted to dine there but was told Restaurant is close and had to eat in bar.On the website they describe the Hotel as a fantastic place to stay but Restaurant is close.What a shame for ****(four star hotel).
There's no concierge at all! We wanted to get more info about Dublin but receptionist was permanently answering the phones and could n't talk to us at all.What a customer service!!!
My general impression is not good at all.The Hotel is an average place to stay,there is no Restaurant(food is served in Bar),lack of swimming pool and concierge.
I won't stay there anymore!",2,2011,07,02
213,Dissappointed with the fact that I was unable to cancel a room 48 hours in advance.,"Read the small print!! I tried to cancel a room in The Herbert Park, was told unable to!! Without the full price of €145 been charged to my credit card. Despite it been the busiest week end in Dublin with the Take That Concert!! And when my friend rang up to see if there was a room available for the Sunday night was told there was a waiting list and that a double  room would cost her €250...  So who is the winner here...  Very dissappointed.",1,2011,06,17
213,"It was ok , nothing special!","Close to the RDS where I was attending a conference. My room was spacious but in need of updating, looked a bit tired but was clean and comfortable. Had room service and the food was served promtly and was nice. When I went to the bar I was kept waiting a long time on a few occassions even though the staff were standing around talking. I found at the hotel was the time reception took to check me in and out due to what looked like a lack of staff, there was only one person working on reception who was trying to check people in and outm call people cabs and answer the phones all at the same time! Checking out took well over half an hour and I almost ran late for my flight.",3,2011,06,06
213,Good hotel choice for D4 area,"Have stayed here on numerous occasions, its proximity to the RDS is a bonus but for city centre meetings would prefer to stay a more central location and is  also on the opposite side of city to Dublin airport. Aircoach service to/from  Dublin airport is an option.

Both reservations and check-in are always very efficient; hotel  decor is minimalist, particularly the lobby. Rooms are a  satisfactory size, however, avoid a single room unless every other hotel is booked up as too small, including microscopic TV and no work desk but the executive rooms are excellent. 

Rooms are always immaculate and offer good sound insulation, rarely hear other guests/corridor noise. Quality toiletries, including little extras such as sewing kits, are a welcome touch.  Great neighbourhood, adjacent to RDS and Aviva stadium is also nearby. Overall, Herbert Park is a good choice for any business/leisure guest within the D4 area. 

Main con: no swimming pool.",4,2011,05,28
213,"Bright comfortable rooms, great location",I have stayed in this hotel three times in the past year and have always been happy with it. The rooms are spacious and bright with good lighting --a rarity in hotels nowadays. An excellent breakfast is served in the lovely dining-room overlooking Herbert Park.,5,2011,05,21
213,Great location,"Stayed with my wife and could not fault the hotel. Great location for RDS and city centre.
Also Rolys Bistro just out side the side enterence",4,2011,05,04
213,Appalling customer service,"I live in Dublin. In October, I made reservations via Booking.com for two rooms with breakfast for family guests visiting for Christmas. Due to snow and flight delays, my guests did not arrive as scheduled, and I was charged no-show for the first reservation. I called the hotel to ask if I could have the room on the day after the no-show or as a voucher for any other day in the future. I was told by the reservation that they couldnt do that. I ask to speak to the marketing manager, and the manager said I could pay for another room if I want to have a room on another day. Basically, like a previous reviewer said, the hotel's principle is: we could charge you so we will. There was an utter lack of  goodwill, and it galls me even now to think that they could do business this way--esp that this entire business is about customer service, and that the hospitality industry is an ailing industry, operating in an ailing Irish economy. The manager tried to hide behind booking.com--saying it was booking.com that charged my credit card-- and she tried to make it look like she's not empowered to give me a room another day. She herself admitted that the hotel was NOT occupied to full capacity on the no-show day or the day after it. I told her I wasnt trying to get my money back, just hoping the hotel would deliver its services as paid for. But to no avail.
A few days later, the hotel charged me no-show again for the next hotel reservation. This, when I specifically asked reception to cancel all reservations, following this galling exchange  with the marketing manager. I paid over 200EUR for my mistakes and the hotel just took my money happily. 
If the hotel earns its revenue by cancellation charges, customers, beware!
With such experience of ill-will as this, I can  only look forward to a change in hotel management.",1,2011,03,28
213,Can do better,"Nice Hotel if a little souless. Rooms are very clean and comfortable and great location for RDS,Aviva stadium. Staff in Bar and Restaurant for Breakfast could be friendlier not a smile among them all.

There is a charge for WIFI and for parking overnight (€10) for guests,considering their competitors in the area don't charge for these they need to be doing other things better, they're not.

Pity because it could be better with a little effort.",3,2011,03,06
213,Disappointed considering loyalty...,"As a regular business guest at the Herbert Park hotel (having spent many thousands of Euro there during 2010), was extremely disappointed to be charged full room rate for cancelling my room at late notice - this has only happened once and I have been staying there on every trip to Dublin for the past 4+ years......   I would have thought some loyalty concession would be forthcoming, but alas, none was offered or even considered despite my request for same...   I've now moved my business to 4* The Beacon up the road (which includes free parking... free wi-fi.... and more reasonable restaurant prices in their fantastic Thai restaurant)...   I had recommended many many business colleagues to relocate to the Herbert Park and I'm now making a conscious effort to have them relocate to The Beacon !!......  Won't be back... and in fact, it wasn't what you said.... but how yousaid it.... bascially ""too bad - we're entitled to charge you"".... so your loss !!!",2,2011,03,06
213,Lovely hotel!,"I have been staying in the Herbert Park Hotel over 4 years now. It's exceptionally clean, rooms are spacious, very good breakfast and prompt evening room service-it's exactly what every business traveler needs. I like the fact that they note your requests and if you are lucky they give you exactly the type of room you like! However, recently with staff changes the requests tend to be overlooked. I'm sure with Egle back on the team things will go back to being perfect again. It's one of the best hotels in Dublin, especially when you have to spend more time away then at home, it's important to feel welcomed back.",5,2011,02,16
213,Comfort and friendlyness at the right price,"Found this hotel by chance on the internet and decided to stay with no expectations, due to the very reasonable price and we were greatly susprised with the loveliness of the hotel.

Its just minutes walk from the south city centre.",5,2011,02,12
213,All on the one street - handy location.,"Had to stay in Dublin for an event in the RDS.  This hotel is next door, has parking (which was included otherwise a €10 charge) and is near great restaurants and bars.  Staff very attentive, loved the coffee in the room on arrival (delivered up to us in the room) and breakfast the next day was top notch.  Only fault was bar was a bit quiet but hey, who's in a hotel bar on a friday night in Dublin?!!  We did though have a lovely few drinks there - great bar staff - and met 2 very interesting guests as well.  Room had a view of the park as promised and was nice to look out at and very private.  I'll be back as a man once said.",5,2011,02,11
213,Most fabulous suite in Dublin,"I have stayed in the Herbert Park for years on business.  It is a calm, spacious, easy going space: great if your mind is elsewhere.  This year I was upgraded to the most fabulous suite (out of my loyalty I suppose) in Ireland.  I had just arrived from a 5 star paris hotel, so was amazed to be blown away by the : atmosphere, decoration, cleanliness, views, and basic home away from home that this suite offered.  I've stayed in many Dublin hostelries, but the Herbert Park, a modern building in Dublin 4, near the RDS and the US Embassy, beats them all.  Staff are kind and welcoming, breakfast is just fine and the open feeling and space of the entire place makes any activity there a pleasure.",4,2011,02,02
213,made to feel like a criminal,i have stayed in this hotel on a few occasions.paid up front on arrival as usual along with the 100 euro deposit. After a long journey ordered a cup of tea but what a hassle as i had only sterling to pay for it!  security is also rediculous i.e. door key in lift. receptionists not friendly;Definitely wont be back.,3,2011,01,11
213,A Joke!,"Stayed here for one night(thank god we had not booked for longer!). When we arrived at 12.30 we were told our room would not be available till after 3 even though we had informed the hotel when booking that our arrival time would be 11.30am. I was rushing to attend a trade show that day so really didn't need this! Attitude of staff seemed like they didn't care. When we eventually got to the room to be fair it was very nice, clean and well appointed. Breakfast the following morning considering the price of it was poor. Then the icing on the cake .... I was a little late checking out, after all it was a sunday morning and when I say a late it was only 12.30(check out time was 12.00) when I received a call to my room advising me that if I was not out by 1 o clock a €50 charge would be applied to my room rate(where in the booking form do they advise of this I wonder?). This in a country that relies so heavily on tourism is quite simply shocking! I will be writing to the general manager and also local politicians highlighting the customer service(of lack of!) in this hotel. Having read some previous reviews it looks like management may have changed possibly recently as the reviews seem to be getting progressively worse. And for the record yes I am involved in the trade and we in killarney would love to add €50 additional charges to our customer room rates for sleeping in a bit!! The difference is in killarney and kerry in general WE CARE!",2,2010,11,28
213,Extremely poor for a rugby weekend!,"We frequently attend rugby internationals and usually stay in either Fitzpatrick, Dalkey or Grand Malahide and travel to and from ground via DART. This game my parents attended with us and so decided to stay here for its proximity to the aviva stadium.
We booked one month in advance for two exec rooms, confirming our arrival for 12noon. We were unable to get into one of the rooms until after the game (k.o. 5.30pm). The staff were not even apologetic and when it came to check-out, refused point blank to discount our bill.
We found customer service throughout our stay to be extremely poor and inpersonal with no consideration given to residents during this busy weekend.
Another major problem at breakfast was that a number of guests were allowed to enter the dining room in bare feet whilst at the buffet!!
I definitely reccomend if you are considering this hotel for rugby internationals you look further afield for a more luxurious, enjoyable and better-value stay.
On a positive note, the hotel room was very well appointed.",2,2010,11,22
213,Lacking,"Stayed on business trip. location good for my meetings. hotel staff nothing exceptional, not very friendly. Bar in lobby, no backround music, food expensive and beverages. roomsno tea/coffee, no bathrobe or slippers,  no iron or iron boar only on request. Air condition noisy during the night. Charge for  WIFI !! Charge for parking !!! Cooked Breakfast seemed to be cooked from dawn !! Stick with cold buffet, safer. 
Return visit ... NO",3,2010,10,19
213,Late checkout = Great idea,"We had a very nice stay in the herbert park, we took advantage of the indulgance package which I'd highly recommend which includes a late checkout of 2pm & a late breakfast up to 12. We were going to a gig in the O2 & this is the perfect location for that as well. Will be back again",4,2010,10,07
213,Could do better,"I have stayed in this hotel many times (e.g. when more favoured ones had no rooms).  The rooms were of good standard and clean. Location is ok for access to city centre.  I agree with comments of other reviewers, this hotel is let down by; check in policy of demanding deposit leaves a sour taste on arrival (I have never had to do this elsewhere and on one occasion I was embarrassed to see how visitors to this country were treated when they questioned this practice)), no tea/coffee making facilities in room, unfriendly reception staff.  My overall impression is of a hotel with good basic elements let down by lack of focus on service and customer needs.  This type of culture comes from the top.",3,2010,09,26
213,very helpful staff,"had a great couple of days relaxing.
just a quick bus ride to city centre.
restaurant  is looking right onto Herbert Park",5,2010,08,30
213,Good Hotel,"This was our first time staying in this hotel though we have stayed in Ballsbridge on many occasions. The location was great as there is a park right outside the door of the hotel with childrens playgrounds and duck pond so ideal for our 3 year old to run off some energy from being cooped up in the car all day. Its also a short walk to the Lansdowne Road DART station so we only needed the car to arrive and leave.

 The public areas are nice and well kept and there is a great breakfast selection at which we ate as much as we could manage and then did not need to eat lunch later(apart from the 3 year old of course who eat a large breakfast followed by a sizeable lunch!!). The restaurant wasn't open at night, only the bar menu which looked expensive for what was on offer. However their is a good selection of restaurants right on the doorstep with good value being offered on early birds.

Our room was fine - it was at the side of the hotel so had mixed views - in that we looked down on roofs BUT looking directly out was the skyline of Dublin. It was very quiet and we never had noise from either adjoining rooms or the corridor. There is also air-conditioning which is always welcome in hotel rooms as I find that they tend to get a bit over-heated. The bedroom(with a very comfortable king-size bed) was clean and well maintained as was the bathroom. The mini-bar is good in that there is still room to place some of your own items in it(in our case milk for our daughter)...obviously its expensive to take anything from it. 

The only downside was the fact that its 10 euro a night for parking but then all hotels in Ballsbridge(and city centre Dublin) charge for parking so it wasn't a surprise. There was plenty of spaces in the car-park while we were there but if the hotel was full that might not be the case. 

We will defitnetly return on our next trip.",4,2010,08,22
213,Nice Hotel,"Stayed here in 2009. Normally would have stayed in centre of Dublin albeit all hotels were tending to overcharge due to events in town. On this ocassion we were over to see U2 at Croke Park, quite a distance from the hotel, but enjoyed the walk into town (about 15 to 20 mins). Really liked the hotel and would definitely recommend (we had a very good deal), escpecially good if your going to Landsdowne Road/Aviva stadium as its about a 5 mins walk away. I would say hotel probably more suited to corporate, this may be why rates were so good at weekend.",5,2010,08,08
213,excellent. will be back,"Staff were more than helpful. Our package included free parking, otherwise wouyld have to had paid 10 euro per night.

Steak on Saturday night was good. cooked to my liking. Breakfast in our room Sunday. at no extra charge. Map of Dublin supplied on request.",5,2010,08,05
213,"Ideally situated near Railway station , Clean comfortable and good value for money","We stayed from the 8th to the 11th June 2010. We were received courteously at check in and, after some confusion locating our reservation on the computer system, we were directed to our room  - a double which was bright ,clean and adequately spacious with a good sized flat screen tv offering a selection of terrestrial and satellite channels.. Tea & Coffee facilities were provided.  The bathroom was pleasant and clean with an excellent shower. However I  advise intending guests to bring their own shower/shampoo requisites as provision of these is poor. A shower gel dispenser encased in a thief proof holder requires some practice to extract an adequate amount of gel. The quality of the gel itself was very poor. The bed was very comfortable, and the room quiet so that we had very restful sleep.

The hotel provides complimentary computer facilities in a specially designated area and, additionally,  one  may use ones own equipment by paying for broadband access, the charge commensurate with usage time.
Breakfast is served in the main dining room which is very tastefully appointed overlooking the Garden.  For Breakfast there was a choice between traditional cooked full Irish and a very good Buffet offering muesli, an assortment of the usual breakfast cereals , fresh fruit and nuts, yogurts and preserved grapfruit, pineapple, apricots and prunes, assorted breads  pastries and preserves. All self-service but tea/coffee was brought to table.
Evening meals are served in the main bar area and besides a varied but modest menu 'Specials' are offered each evening. Sadly the enjoyment of what were basically nice well prepared and presented dishes was spoiled by the length of waiting time between ordering and the dishes arriving at table with long delays between courses. The main problem appeared to be understaffing. Two people were trying to serve the people in the bar and also a tour group downstairs in the main restaurant.  Effectively  this left most of the serving work in the bar to one person, as the other waiter/ witress  also had to bring drink orders to the tour group downstairs. To ease matters the barman came out from the bar when he could to help take orders and serve. There appeared to be no system in dealing with diners in rotation as they arrived so ,for example people who came in well after my wife and I, had their orders taken and were served before us. That said, the waiting staff were very friendly and courteous and showed remarkable coping skills under such pressure. 
The hotel is ideally situated, being within a few minutes walking distance  of the Lansdowne Rd. DART station allowing easy access to Dublin City Centre as well as to many attractive coastal beaches and towns. The new Aviva Stadium is just near the Station. 

Overall we had a very pleasant stay and will return again.",4,2010,06,20
213,Very Good Business Hotel in Heart of Ballsbridge,Pleasantly surprised with this hotel which is nicely situated beside the RDS.  Staff were very friendly and breakfast was good. Rooms are getting a bit dated but on the whole very good. Parking is extra.  Would stay here again without hesitation.,4,2010,06,19
213,horrific,"when we arived the lobby was like a morge no atmosphere but as we were going to rihanna in the o2 we didnt mind! our stay was ok pokey room definatly not 3 star standard the staff were so unhelpful,unfriendly and rude.when we were checking out the day after we went to the recption i am 22 years of age and i dont own a credit card so i paid cash on arrival. i also paid a 100 deposit i presumed that would be if we raided the mini bar, wrecked the hotel etc. now i went to the concert with my sister she is 18 and when we went to collect our deposit the next day we were told to wait for the safe to open for our deposit! The manager left the front desk left a load of people waiting and as we found out afterwards had inspected my room.Those of you familiar with the tan sally hanson which is used by nearly every girl in ireland knows this tan is messy but washes off instantly,when we applied the tan on the tiled bathroom floor it did get onto the floor but  which we presumed it would be washed off by the cleaners the manager rudly told us we damaged the room left stains everywhere and to add insult to injury he implied i soiled myself  in the bed because of brown stains from the tan in front of the whole reception i was mortified. when i asked for an itemised bill on the damage caused i was told i would be removed from the hotel as the manager wanted to get on with more important work as he put it. am disgusted how a hotel manager woul treat a customer. OH one more thing went for breakfast at 7.00 but it didnt start until 8 was asked rudley in breakfast area what i wanted return to my room they didnt start until 8. Horrific i have stayed in so many hotels and never been treated like this.",1,2010,05,24
213,"Good hotel, good value, pleasant lobby / cafe. Recommended.","My last stay in Dublin was not enjoyable.  I stayed at the Grand Canal Hotel, and was not very impressed - poor value and not a great hotel.  This time I went for the other choice I was offered by the client, the Herbert Park.  This is entirely different and has made my time in Dublin to date far more enjoyable.  The room is a good size and clean, the staff are friendly and attentive, and the cafe/bar is a relaxing place to work with a coffee.  My only gripes are that wifi is not complimentary for hotel guests and that parking costs 10euro per night.  I would stay here again.",4,2010,05,10
213,OK,"Clean room and nice sized, jacuzzi spouts in bathtub. 

We had to ring from our cellphones to get the concierge to pick up the phone as they never answered when we hit 0. And even then, we let it ring out 20 minutes. Ridiculous.

Breakfast was plentiful in a nice room with nice view of Herbert Park.

Everything was extra - 10euro to park, 12 euro for movie, rent the game thingy on TV 8euro,  even internet was 10euro. 

We paid 144euro for a Saturday night in D4, not crazy - but when you can stay at Bewley's for 89 or Jury's for 39, not sure what made this so much more worthwhile as wasn't the Four Seasons or the Shelbourne!",3,2010,04,19
213,Comfortable weekend break,"We visited Dublin with our 9 mth old baby, and we picked the right place to stay. The staff were really friendly and accommodating, the food was good, the location perfect. 
We enjoyed the views over Herbert Park while the little man slept in our family size bed - it was huge! So no worries about planting him in the travel cot. 
Getting into the city centre was so quick and there are some great pubs nearby for watching the Rugby.
We'll be back",4,2010,04,12
213,Stay away .......,"This hotel has the worst customer care I have ever come across. The staff , from the moment you arrive want your credit card to cover incidentals, if however you dont have a cc they want a hundred Euro upfront. They will make you sit in reception until your partner goes to an ATM. No tea or coffee making facilities in room. Rooms really dated and mouldy, leaking shower. A charge of 15 Euro for internet access. Terrible service in lobby area, from trying to get your order taken to getting your bill to waiting for your change, as another tripadvisor contributer said they wont let you charge it to your room ,evev though they have your hundred euro for 'incidentals'. And here is the icing on the cake 10 Euro per night to park your car in the hotel car park. They know you have no choice but to do that as it is metered parking everywhere in the Ballsbridge area. Never ever again will I darken the doorstep of this hotel. I wrote an email of complaint to the appropriate member of staff as I had requested her name on checkout, this was promptly ignored, no surprise there then.",1,2010,04,02
213,Best Service - Best location,"I travel to Dublin regularly, often with colleagues or clients - and we really enjoyed the Herbert Park. The best things I can say are the service and location are great -  beautiful, well presented, professional and very efficient staff give the right impression right from the start, but the best thing about this hotel is the Park right outside - it is a gem in the center of Dublin 4. The lobby is bright and airy and OK for business meetings - but its minimalist decor is not 'user-friendly' enough. It could be a great locating if they invested in upgrading the lobby area into something more befitting the beautiful surrounding - more style and comfort would really bring this hotel to the next level. cannot say enough for the member of staff at reception, who was just excellent throughout.  Great location, great staff, could be great with upgraded lobby. Needs more atmosphere.",5,2010,03,20
213,"No tea and coffee making facilities in a hotel in Dublin, you must be joking!!","My fiance and I stayed at this hotel for two nights during the St Patricks festival in an executive room which we had won as part of a competition. Check in upon arrival was ok and on first impression the hotel looks pretty impressive. However when you get to your ""executive room"" that impression quickly changes! The first word that springs to my mind is ""refurbishment"" which is what their executive rooms seem to need. We have stayed in many hotel rooms which weren't even executives and which beat this room hands down. The furniture was dated and wearing, the tv pretty similar, the bath was leaking slightly and there seemed to be a balcony but no way of getting out to it. Secondly we were astonished to realise that they had no tea or coffee making facilities and we didn't even ask as we had read the other reviews. Very disappointing for a hotel in Ireland! There were some nice touches such as complimentary bottled water, newspapers and an umbrella (only in executives and suites). Generally the room was a good size with a king size bed but very hard pillows. We had to ask for other ones. Maid service was good and the maid was helpful but breakfast service was very poor on our first morning. The waitressses seemed very unhappy to see us as we arrived at quarter to ten and when a man came down at 10.03 am he was refused breakfast as he was 3 mins late even though it is a buffet breakfast and there were still plenty of items available. The service was better on the second morning.
Finally what annoyed me the most was that as we were just finished getting ready to depart and about to leave our room at 12.20 pm (only 20 mins after checkout time) we got a phonecall from reception to tell us to get out! I understand that checkout is at 12 but as I said before we have stayed in many hotels and have never been told to leave. They didn't give us a chance!! As grateful as I am to have won this competition I was very disappointed in their level of customer care and even more disappointed at the lack of luxury in the room I was expecting to get. On checkout we weren't asked if we had enjoyed our stay. I will say one thing which is that if you want to go to this hotel just go for dinner. The service and food that we got at dinner time in the lobby area was excellent. Try the steak and pepper sauce! Unfortunately I have to agree with the other reviews that the hotel needs to listen to their customers and meet their needs through providing tea and coffee facilities in all bedrooms and training all of their staff (apart from the bar and cleaning staff) on how to treat their customers so that the customers want to come back again and recommend it to their family and friends as I'm not sure I would be able to.",3,2010,03,17
213,Very conveniently situated and an enjoyable stay,I'd like to recommend this hotel to anyone going to Dublin on business.    Close to everywhere.... Lovely staff..... pity the bar closed so early but I suppose thats not a complaint but more of an inconvenience but we were allowed to sit in the spacious reception area as long as we liked and we did get a cuppan tae......,5,2010,03,10
213,ok not great,Stayed for one night. Room was very small and bathroom dated and in need of fresh wallpaper! Shower great though. No tea or coffee making facilities. Bed ok. Could hear all noise in corridor. Lobby lovely but bar overpriced. Breakfast was tasty with good selection of fruits and cooked food. Have stayed in better value hotels in Dublin. Had notified hotel of friends birthday and no special treat etc given to her...disappointing!,3,2010,03,06
213,Comfortable Corporate Style Hotel,"We spent one night at the Herbert Park Hotel at the beginning of our CIE tour of Ireland.  The room was large and comfortable.  The triple room had a double and twin bed.  We ate two meals there.  We had lunch in the bar. Breakfast buffet was in the restaurant.  Both meals were very good.  We had a very nice dinner at an Indian restaurant just down the street.  The only downside to this hotel was the distance to downtown Dublin.  Also, Internet access was available but at a high fee.",5,2010,02,23
213,"OK, but watch the nickels and dimes","We stayed here for 3 days, and found the rooms, and facilities to be wee maintained, clean and comfy. The rates were reasonable as well (at a discount) our only minor complaint was when my partner requested a plate and knife to bring to our room for some cheese we had purchased for a snack, we were informed it would be a 6.50 euro fee. A bit of a put off, though not a big deal. We would recommend for a stay from a functional standpoint.",3,2010,02,10
213,Hotel not in the hospitality business !!,"Have stayed here a few times in the past and just recently this weekend.  Have always found the hotel to be fine, it is clean and very central for a visit to Dublin and comparatively reasonable rates.  However I have to say that this time the customer service and hospitality at the hotel was absolutely shocking and appalling, we were staying in the hotel for a two night break and on return from shopping on Saturday we returned to the hotel at approx 2pm, I had purchased a take away tea and paper from newsagent across the road with the intention of bringing back to my room (there are no teamaking facilities in the room), upon returning to my room I found that it was being cleaned and I could not get in, I proceeded to an area in the foyer to wait.  I sat with my husband and we were chatting when a waitress approached me and asked me to leave the area as I had not purchased my tea at the hotel, i explained that I could not get access to my room and had to wait, she was not happy at this and went to get her manager, The restaurant Manager  manager another came over and also requested that I leave the area, at this point people are looking in my direction and it is getting very embarrassing...anyway the duty manager arrived and was not any better she insisted I leave the area and move to another seat at the far side of reception, it was like I was an outcast  was being treated as such, there was no understanding that my room was not ready and it was not my intention to sit there and drink my 'take away tea', I could not believe they were making such a fuss, I stood my ground and after about 5 mins I returned to my room, absolutely fuming.  I spoke to the other duty manager the following morning when we were checking out but he said the same that it was policy and really was a little uninterested at what I had to say....another lady was at reception and had a complaint also about something that would have been very easy to rectify like my situation but the staff are incapable and it seems the managers of making any decisions or using their initiatiive  to deal with any problems that arise, they are after all in the hospitality business and really need to get back to basics and learn what hospitality is all about -  its such a shame and I will certainly not be staying at this hotel again and I really liked staying here, but I was so humiliated and upset at how they treated me and handled the situation that I will not be giving them my business in the future.",1,2010,02,08
213,Very poor customer service policy of cash deposit,"This hotel has a policy that if you have no credit card they take 100 euro disposit cash only, it cannot be paid by laser card but payment for room can, we turned up late for a function we had to go to and had no cash ask them to use laser could not asked them to let wife go up and get ready and I come down in five mins and go and get cash they refused outright my wife had to sit in reception while I went over to pass machine in rain to get cash. There refusal to let wife up to room to start to get ready as we late already was rude. Then when we came back at 12 got two sandwiches and they retused to put it on bill I had to go up to room get wallet and come back down and pay 30 euros while hotel had 100 cash belonging to me, To be honest hotel and price was ok but service and complete lack of customer care made it not worth.",2,2010,01,31
213,"Lovely hotel, Fantastic food.","I have stayed in the Herbert Park a few times this year and have to say it is a great place. The rooms are very spacious and have lovely views over Herbert Park and it is in a great location in Dublin, but my favourite thing is the food - the breakfast is amazing, as is the lounge food and dinner in the restaurant....which is unusual for a hotel in my experience...",5,2009,11,20
213,simply the best by far,"im just back to england from a week in the herbert park hotel,dublin.i have stayed in many hotels there and this was simply the best by far.the staff and service was second to none.nothing was to much trouble for the staff.you need a resturant,the staff add me booked into one in minites.the full irish beakfast was out of this world.thats something coming from an english man.i would recommend this hotel to anybody.",5,2009,10,02
213,Worlds best breakfast!,"Stayed just one night but will definately be back . Hotel is spotless, staff pleasant and helpful, rooms are a good size. The lunch menu is great but the breakfast is the best I have ever experienced in any hotel, for that alone i will return !",5,2009,09,18
213,Hotel oasis in Dublin city,"I stayed at the Herbert Park for one night, far to short to be honest. A super find in the city, its location on the edge of Herbert Park and in Ballsbridge is fantastic. I arrived into Dublin airport and hopped on the Aircoach to Ballsbridge it took about 40 mins and cost €14.00 return very good value , a 3 minute walk  later and I found myself in the Herbert Park hotel. Check-in was quick and effecient, the staff were curtious. My room was on the 2nd floor and the lift has a reassuring swipe access for hotel guests only.The room was very spacious and clean, and later I had a great sleep in the very comfy bed.
The hotel is well located for business and pleasure as I witnessed in the morning ,there was a breakfast conference being held in the hotel and the smell of coffee and the array of fresh pastries looked great, however I headed to the dining room for my delish breakfast, all the usual fresh fruit, yogurts etc, and hot breakfasts, however I decided to treat myself and had pancakes with maple syrup which was great.
After breakfast I had time for a lovely walk in the park which was like an oasis in the city hard to believe that within an hour I was back on the coach and heading back to the airport.
I would really recommend this hotel which has a great location for shopping or business with plenty of great restaurants and bars in the immediate vicinity and is about 10 mins from the city centre.
I will definitely be back. Well done Herbert Park.",5,2009,09,18
213,good hotel but one thing ruined it for me......,"i stopped one night as i had a workshop in the RDS and the hotel is opposite. The hotel was quite easy to find and is next to Herbert Park which is lovely. I booked a standard room with breakfast for 89 euro which i thought was fairly reasonable but had to pay another 10 euro for car parking and another 10 euro for use of internet (reduced from 15 euro) but the one thing that ruined my stay ,as i had a lot of work to do in  my room, and they didn't provide you with any kettle or tea facilities, for that reason alone i would not stay any longer than one night, i c/o to the receptionist who was also the manager and she said they'll only provide kettles for nursing mothers, i refuse to pay there prices for tea and coffee when you've paid high prices for a room, The mini bar was silly prices,  3 euro for a bar of chocolate and 7 euro for a tiny wine.....",3,2009,09,12
213,"Amazing Breakfast, car park charge cheeky!!","Just stayed for one night, was upgraded to a 5th floor room, room was ok, very comfortable bed, I would say 5/6 years ago the hotel was fabulous, just felt that its a bit tired now, towels were old and not fluffy and nice like hotel towels usually are and robe was gone a little bare as well! Wallpaper was starting to peel a bit as well.

Thought that it was a bit cheeky to ask guests to pay €10 to park!! They also charged for every little thing, and €6.20 was a bit steep for a pink of Heinekin!! Saying that it was still the best deal that I could find for a one night stay and will return for convenient location and price.

The breakfast was absolutly fabulous, have stayed in many hotels and it was far superior to most. Great selection of fresh fruit, pastries and granola, also lovely hot buffet, would go back fro the breakfast alone!!!",4,2009,09,01
213,Only place to stay in Dublin,"Recently stayed in the Herbert Park for a week and also stayed for a week during 2008, both business trips. This hotel ticks all the right boxes.
Fantastic staff, fantastic location, fantastic food and overall a very very enjoyable stay.
When I checked in on the Sunday night I enquired as to what floor my room was, I was told that same was on the 3rd floor and that "" everything was as per my last stay "" thought that was a lovely touch that the staff acknowledge a guest that has stayed previously.
Everything about this hotel is perfect , I would highly recommend for business or pleasure",5,2009,08,08
213,Nice hotel - service needs an upgrade,"My wife and I stayed here for 3 nights while on vacation in Dublin.  We were upgraded to an executive room at check-in - nice room with separate bath overlooking the park.  No complaints about the room.  Front desk staff were very nice and helpful.  The area around the hotel is nice - good restaurants within walking distance including Roly's (good breakfast) and a great Thai restaurant.  Negatives - Where are the employees?  When we arrived there was no doorman or bellhop.  We had several large bags and golf clubs and no one to help.  My wife finally grabbed a luggage cart and we did it ourselves.  In our 3 days at the hotel, I saw a bellhop once.  We found the service in the lobby bar to be somewhat lacking - not enough staff and the ones that are there move a bit slow.  Breakfast in the restaurant is too pricey and you cannot order a la carte (but you can order other items in the lobby bar, which we did).  Food was OK - nothing special.  Overall a good stay  - nice clean rooms, but a bit lacking in service.",3,2009,07,30
213,High quality hotel in a great area,"I was originally booked to stay at a nearby hotel but due to over booking my reservation was moved to the Herbert Park hotel.  Before I left for Dublin I was slightly worried by the vast difference of opinion in the trip advisor reviews for this hotel but I have to say that I can't see any justification in the negative reviews this hotel has received.  Greeting upon arrival and check-in was excellent especially since we'd arrived quite early, well before the normal 2pm check-in time and yet a room was ready and the receptionists were very friendly and helpful even though they were very busy at the time due to a large influx of guests arriving at the same time.
Hotel room was very nicely furnished and well equipped, and cleanliness was good.
Location was slightly further our of the centre of Dublin than I was hoping for (good 30 minute walk) however the AirCoach from the Airport stops just across the road, and there are good bus services into town and the Lansdown Road DART station is only 5 minutes walk away which is a really good way of getting into town or up to Croke Park.  
The hotel is at the entrance to Herbert Park which is a very pleasant park great for a relaxing walk, also the area surrounding the hotel is pretty quiet yet there are a few shops, pubs and restaurants all within a couple of minutes walk.
Only downside to the hotel is the high prices for food and drink, but hey you don't have to eat there.  We found that 19 euros each for breakfast was a bit steep so we found that Roly's Bistro just around the corner done a fantastic breakfast service as well as great food throughout the day.
Really good stay and would stay again but would only use the hotel's restaurant/bar if only the prices weren't so expensive.",4,2009,07,29
213,Dont stay there unless you want to get robbed,I stayed at the Herbert Park for the take that concert and my sisters room was robbed. I had came home from the States with my husband and she was after telling us she booked us a lovely hotel for the concert. But how wrong did we get that.  When she reported the robbery they asked for time for them to investigate what was after happening. We were returning back to cork on the Sunday and were told we would be informed about the investigation. We got a call alright but the female manager was rude and ignorant. She basically didnt care if we were robbed or not and said there was nothing she could do. We still have not heard a word back from them even though they were meant to speak to one of the members of staff that entered the room. Four staff member's was alot to go into a room when you were still checked in for another night. The staff were not helpfull or considerate in anyway. I wouldnt reccommend a dog stay there never mind tourist's from America and friends and family. NOT RECOMMENED TO STAY. They took €500 of a security deposit from us when we checked in!!! They should have given us the deposit after what happened.,1,2009,07,10
213,"When its Dublin, its the herbert park","Since i stayed here, every time i have to go Dublin, whether its business or leisure i always go back to this hotel. Great value for money, incredible staff, best location, steps from the RDS!(such a gem for concerts!!) and a short walk to city centre! quiet and safe. Rooms are spacious, well maintained and absolutely spotless. Honestly i cannot find a flaw about this place, and while i don't usually give reviews, i do read them, that's why i cannot help but write this one! anyone who has been to Dublin with a car, would know that the price you pay to park in this hotel is more than reasonable.",5,2009,07,04
213,my room was robbed and the staff did  not care!!!!,"i stayed at this hotel with some friends and on the morning i was checking out i realized a gift that was given to me by one of my friends was missing from my bag. it was a Satina a navigational system for my car. i had not taken this bag out of the room and had not taken the satina out of its box. I alerted the manager on that sunday and found him to be helpful he asked that i give hime 24 hours to do their own investigation i did, and returned to Cork. the next day i did recieve a call from a different manager who was rude, condenseding and very unhelpful. she said it was my problem. I did however find out that when i left my room 4 hotel staff were in my room which i was still booked in. this to me seems like a lot of people. i would not recommend staying at this hotel as there is obviously a privicy issue and even worse a theft issue.

213,Blacklist this place,"The staff at the Herbert Park seem intent on squeezing every last euro out of their clients. I was a long term tenant and ordered room service several times a week, when my family came to visit I was told that I was only entitled cutlery for my children if they ordered room service. After spending thousand with them over 3 months they were worried about getting an extra fiver as I left the building.",1,2009,06,08
213,Absolutely fantastic,"We were attending a concert in the O2 and we chose Herbert Park Hotel for our stay.  It was located just a short taxi ride away from the venue.  We thoroughly enjoyed our time at Herbert Park, the staff were very helpful, our room was immaculate and the breakfast buffet had plenty of fabulous food on offer.  I do not have one single complaint about my stay and I will definitely be back for more!",5,2009,06,06
213,"Fees, charges, surcharges........","Visited the hotel on a sunday evening with some family members for tea.   Left feeling very annoyed.  

Business is down in hotels these days and some hotels are responding by offering better value, while others are seemingly slapping on charges to preserve cashflows.  Alas, from my experience in this hotel, my impression is definitely the latter. Its a 4 star in Dublin that charges Euro 4.50 for a cup of tea per person; Euro 22.50 for Chicken Curry ! Sorry guys you're not a 5 star on the Champs Elysee.  So tea for 3 people was almost Euro 15.  I accept that hotels are free to charge what they like and was trying to rationalise the steep prices when I walked over to reception and was then asked to pay a Euro 5 parking fee for the hour stay we were there.  Most decent hotels will validate your parking  for free(as they only are trying to stop chancers from taking advantage).  But, not here, they impose a Euro 5 fee on visitors during the day.  This has been introduced from Jan 08..That wouldnt be about the time when the Dublin hotel business really began to slow down would it?  I really got the impression that this was an effort to hit customers with extra charges (nice 100% margin) (I note other comments below about no tea/coffee facilities in the rooms (perhaps you can get a tea for 2 sent up for Euro 9?) and general miserliness with very high fees/prices.  AVOID.",2,2009,06,02
213,Pretty Average,"Sayed for one night with my teenage niece after a pop concert. Althougn our room was clean and comfortable there were no tea or coffee-making facilities, and no complimentary water. There was a mini-bar and room service was available, but both of these are wildly overpriced so we did not avail. Although there were two of us, our tiny bathroom contained only one little bottle of shampoo, and one of shower gel. Would it really have been so expensive for them to have provided two? The heat in the room was stifling, despite repeated attempts to adjust the air conditining. In the end we just gave up. Breakfast the next morning was the usual buffet-style presentation. Plentiful, but stone cold. Why can't a 4* hotel manage to keep sausages warm? I asked for a pot of hot water and was presented with something brown and nasty. Perhaps they took it directly from the river. Yuk! We also paid €10 for parking overnight. I don't think this hotel represented value for money in a recession, and would not recommend it.",3,2009,05,29
213,Parking Fee Rip Off,"Had a Sunday lunch here. Large party of us, 10+. Spent a pretty penny. Food was ok. What really annoyed me was that they wouldn't even validate our parking tickets. Customer service?? Mean, tight arsed, penny pinchers. Complained to management, verbally and by letter, all polite language. No response. Good luck to them, I will not darken their door ever again.",1,2009,03,08
213,Nice Hotel but Noisy Room,"I stayed at the hotel in February 2009. The hotel is modern and stylish. Check in was quick and efficient. The room was a good size, modern and clean. The bed was very comfortable. However the room did not have any tea or coffee facilities which was disappointing.  The only problem was that the room I had (Room 405) overlooked some kind of plant equipment which rattled all night long. Light sleepers may find this a problem of sleeping on that side of the hotel. The restaurant was bright and airy on the ground floor. I only had breakfast in the restaurant which was good with a reasonable selection. However some of the cooked breakfast items, which were in warming trays, were on the lukewarm side. The staff were very friendly and efficient. I would recommend the hotel but I would be wary of the room selection if you want a good night’s sleep if you are a light sleeper.",3,2009,03,02
213,Very good,"Got a very good rate for a weekend break. The hotel is in a nice location, has a lovely lobby (a little sterile perhaps but smart, modern and welcoming at the same time), room was excellent - spacious, well furnished and spotless. Recommended.",4,2009,01,01
213,Certainly not worth the money,"I stayed there again for the 3rd time and nothing has changed,  rather it has gotten slightly even more worn. I do not have the luxury of choosing my Dublins hotels, rather my office books it for me.

The problems I have with the hotel are its approach to pricing and offerings. Each time we stay there during midweek over the past 3 years it has been €119 per night for one person in a room. The rooms have mismatched furniture and badly lined wallpaper peeling in a lot of locations.

The rooms do not have tea and coffee which you can now order from room service at €4.50 per pot per person at €4 service charge to your room.

They have free access to WIFI but you must pay for the use of it. That truly defeats the idea of WIFI itself but you can use the public computers if so you wish in the reception area.

The television each time were in terrible condition on the channels with all of them fuzzy.

I fill in my comments cards each time and write these reviews yet through my contact details the hotel never requests further comments nor makes any changes.............except one.

They moved the bar area to squeeze in more meetings rooms. The bar is now where the restaurant was, so a smaller restaurant now. The bar may be brighter with a view of a car park but with the lack of music or any ambience or stools at the bar made it far too formal. Just cross the road outside to the pubs across the road is my suggestion.

The breakfast was €18.50 for a continental and for that I would have expected a bigger offering but sadly I did not. On the first morning I simply had a cereal and a small teeny glass of ornage juice and I had to coverse for around 5 minutes so he would not charge me all that money for a cereal. He grudingly accepted. Now, the full Irish is €23.50 and if you want room service your breakfast will come to €30. 

Parking is now €10 per night whereby it used to be free.

For Ballsbridge on price I would recommend the Bewleys Ballsbridge hotel or the D4 hotel. Ballsbridge hotel is €99 per night and €7.50 for parking and only €9.50 for a continental.

When you arrive at the hotel the foyer looks great and you get ag great feeling about the hotel. Once the lift doors open on your floor you get that sinking feeling. All the budget went on the front of house. 

The staff themselves are extremely polite and helpful even though I had to ask for my €18.50 toast 3 times. The concierge / bellhop is very helpful.

I would normally finish by saying you should book with confidence but this time I must say that you can definately do better.",2,2008,10,04
213,Excellent 10/10,"Absolutely excellent,would struggle to fault this hotel in any shape or form which is unusual for me :-).  I did actually post a review a month or two ago and for some reason it wasn't uploaded but I wanted to take the effort to repost as we had a great stay.  Actually stayed on a business trip X 3 nights as we were exhibiting at the conference centre across the road and would definately like to return for leisure.  I guess the main thing to point out is the Hotel is a good taxi ride into the centre of town, however Ballsbridge was a nice area with some good restaurants and pubs to choose from if you do wish to stay local.  I loved the design of the hotel, it is contemporary but homely at the same time and was one of the nicest and biggest double rooms we have stayed in for a while.  Really impressive reception area, nice lounge/bar great for a coffee or a cocktail.  Didnt eat in the restaurant for dinner however we did opt to have breakfast on our last 2 mornings and again was one of the best breakfasts we have had for a long time with EXCELLENT service.  I am ex hotel trade and b.fast service is usually dire in hotels however the Restaurant Manager was charming and both he and the staff took the time to visit each table to check on the diners, clear tables etc.  Lovely view across the park next door too.  My husband nipped back to the room one afternoon and commented that the housekeepers were actually cleaning the air conditioning vents so it is spotlessly clean.  Unless you are looking to be in the dead centre of Dublin or not prepared to take a taxi I really couldnt recommend the Hotel enough.  Pricewise it was expensive with the value of the Euro and didnt include breakfast but overall I felt we got our money's worth.",5,2008,08,25
213,Modern Hotel,"stayed in this hotel just for a night, decent location, very modern, decent size rooms, charges for car parking which i think is ridicolous, also reception staff pretty hopeless, overall not bad though if you get a good deal on the price",3,2008,08,19
213,Don't even think about it!,"Stayed in this hotel for 5 nights because of close proximity to RDS and several previous reasonable experiences in it.  Unfortunately it turned out to be nothing short of a disaster.  

Rude, arrogant staff.  On checking in  we encountered our first problem and the male receptionist pretended not to understand us.  Didn't actually come across any staff whose first language was English.

Shortly after we got to our room we reported our second problem. After some time we were directed to the Duty Manager  and guess what - HEwas the male receptionist who had pretended not to understand us when we checked in!  Not a promising start.  We ended up moving rooms but found the staff very reluctant to help, two or three of them stood around while we packed up and then they begrudgingly pushed the trolley with our bags on it to our new room, unloaded and left without even checking if room was alright.  All this after we had told them that we were on our way out to dinner.

Rooms were reasonably clean, not spacious and lacking in simple things like kettle, cups etc. for making tea.  Charged 5 Euros for an empty cup!!   

Between booking and arriving at hotel they introduced a charge for residents car parking, when we stayed previous it was complimentary.  We were advised as the charges were introduced after our booking was confirmed, that we would not be charged.  Needless to say when checking out we had been charged and had to argue to get this taken off the bill.  

Overall very expensive for what you get,  too many hidden extras.  

Would not even consider staying here again - Dublin has a wealth of good, reasonably priced hotels.",1,2008,08,13
213,Watch the hidden extras,"I normally check this site for reviews before I book; didn't do it when I booked this hotel, but I learnt my lesson.  I travel for work and normally book online with company Credit card and pay on departure with cheque.  I viewed the site and booked in for a Sat-Sun & Mon as I was working in the RDS, which it is adjacent to.  

Upon arrival I was told that company cheques are not accepted and I would need to give a pre auth of my cc of 600, the charge of 109 per room per night and also 100 per day for any extras, but only the charges would be taken from the card on departure.  Fine if I had my cc with me; had to contact my boss on a Saturday evening and get her to drive 15 miles to our office to fill in a form and fax back a copy of the cc.  The receptionist said that's great!!! not understanding the total inconvenience *** It does not state anywhere that company cheques are not accepted.  

I informed the receptionist she would have her form sent back within the hour but she REFUSED to let me check into my room even though I explained I had been working all day.  I checked into the room and then tried to get Broadband working for my laptop to check emails.  The bband wasnt working so I had to move rooms and pack up all my belongings again.  There is also a charge of E15 per day for internet, even if you only use it for 5 mins! Again the hotel website boasts of having internet in every room but no mention of costs.  

When the porter brought me to the next room - Room 211 there was a smell of stale chip fat, I asked was the room near the kitchen and he said it wasnt. The room was very very basic - mini bar/press with a telly on top and a locker with a phone and lamp.

At this stage I was just fed up and went to the bar for some food - I had the chicken pasta, it was very bland to say the least.  The monday night I was woken at 1:30am by a drunken guest returning to his room - fair enough.  At 3:30 I was woken by his friends trying to wake him up and banging his door & shouting.  One of them went down and got his key and started waking him up in the room.  I tried to ring and complain but no reply.

A number of other things happened but you the reader are probably bored by now.  Long story short I asked to speak to the manager on checkout after trying to explain my case.  The manager made no apologies for ANYTHING and would not offer me any redress.  They charged me the full rate per night along with E45 internet charges.  She said if I didn't like the room I could always book a more expensive room.

I stay in hotels  nights a week across the country & I have never had a stay like this.  For a hotel that pitches towards a business clientele and tourists they are waaay overpriced for what you get.  
Anyone thinking of staying here I would recommend to stay in BEWLEYS HOTEL BALLSBRIDGE.  119 PER NIGHT but this included FREE INTERNET, tea/coffee making facilities, a table with 2 chairs, a desk that you can work on, tv, safe, wardrobe and a double & single bed in each room.  I normally stay in bewleys, but they had no rooms for the sat. I WILL NEVER STAY IN THIS HOTEL AGAIN AND HOPE THAT SOMEONE TAKE NOTE OF THIS REVIEW.  Maybe then they will start working on the basics of customer service & more importantly :: SERVICE RECOVERY!",1,2008,07,29
213,Rude staff & rip-off,"It was eur169 for an ""Executive Room"" for one night with no breakfast included. The room was clean but fairly average, no tea / coffee making facilities, only a phone and television. The jacuzzi-bath hardly set the heart racing either. Enquired re: breakfast and was told it would be an additional eur18 to eur21, very pricey as well given that in most hotels it's included in the room price. The ten euro parking fee was a joke as well. The lobby seems to be the only redeeming feature of this over-priced 4 star hotel, but even that has about as much atmosphere as the Milky Way, although the Joan Rivers lookalike did provide brief entertainment, as well as the bourgeoisie middle-aged ladies talking about how best to cook aubergines over afternoon coffee. The staff were not entirely unpleasant but mainly rude, some of them being quite arrogant, you would think they were aristocrats doing community service rather than receptionists. When approaching reception to thank them they looked like they were getting ready for a battle royale. We weren't asked how are stay was upon departure either. When going to give the receptionist a high five a blank stare was received. There was very little about this hotel that was Four Star and it was grossly over-priced, not recommended at all.",2,2008,07,20
213,Lovely 1st nite in Dublin,"HP has a great lobby- we stayed there lst nite on a CIE tour. We arrived before noon and rooms weren't ready - they provided us with coffee&tea. Rooms were not ready til 2- Room was spacious. Bathroom was smal but sufficient.
we ate dinner in the bar rest. Prices were high but no more than any other place in Ireland. Service was pleasant
I found breakfast very nice. Asstment of bread, cheese, eggs meat etc.
I would recommend hotel even though it was not in the heart of Dublin",4,2008,06,01
213,Very nice clean and spacious hotel,"This hotel is modern, stylish, and very clean.  It is a 10 minute taxi ride into central Dublin, but right across the street from the RDS if you have a conference there. It is located in the Ballsbridge area, which is kind of the ""yuppie"" area of Dublin, with a small number of nice restaurants in walking distance.  The restaurant serves simple but perfectly done food. The gym is currently being refurbished, so you have to pay to go to a club across the street if you want to use gym facilities.",4,2008,04,29
213,fab!!!,"This is a wonderful hotel close to the city centre. It is within walking distance to the city, about half an hour stroll. Or any of the buses by the american embassy will take you into the town for 1.5 euros one way (about £1.20). The breakfast is wonderful - continental and irish with lots of fruit. The staff were very helpful and polite. Also they are honest - I left all our money on the bed when we went for breakfast (there is a safe available but I forgot to use it) and when we came back it was still there.
The only bad things to say about the hotel (and certainly not bad enough to ruin the stay)
1. there are no tea/coffee making facilities and you can't have a kettle unless you have a baby or need it to prepare medication. Take a travel kettle if you want a hot drink!!
2. we'd asked for a room with a view of the park and didn't get it but you don't go to Dublin to look out of the hotel window so this really wasn't a problem just abit annoying.
3. the bathroom floor gets very wet when you have a shower so be careful!
In Dublin itself...do the open top bus...an excellent way to see the city. Tickets last 24 hours and you can hop and off. We also went to the guiness factory, dublinea and dublin castle. I thought the castle was the best but I'm not a big fan of guiness and the dublinea looked a little sad and tatty in places but was still very interesting.
The Quays restaurant in Temple Bar was wonderful - best steak I have ever had!!! The Italian restaurant nearby is also good but I can't remember what it was called.",4,2008,04,13
213,Very Disappointing,"We stayed at the Herbert Park hotel in Ballsbridge for 1 night in March 08.It's a 4 star hotel and was E150 for a twin room for the night. We had expected a high standard but were disappointed. Staff were unfriendly and very superior in their attitude.Rooms were quite small , bar food was very expensive and the breakfast was dreadful.We're not picky eaters but the bacon and sausages were cold and the scrambled eggs were raw. Imagine our shock to be charged E22.50 for each breakfast ! We tried to argue the point but the receptionist was most impatient and rude, throwing hers eyes to heaven .Parking is also E10 extra which we were aware of but there was an extra charge for the newspaper.Overall, a most unpleasant experience.",2,2008,03,30
213,Disappointing,"My Wife and I stayed here for 2 nights in an executive room.
First impressions are good with a modern lobby and a good atmosphere.

The room was a bit disappointing for an executive upgrade, the big selling points of which were a box of chocolates (a small box with two chocolates) and a Jacuzzi Bath, (which pumped out dirt into the water when turned on).

The room service dinner was very nice and efficient, but I can’t say the same for the breakfast. Everything in the cooked breakfast was horrible. The scrambled eggs were cold mush; the sausages were barely cooked and stuck to the bottom of the dish with grease. When we asked for fresh sausages, they also came out cold and undercooked. We hoped our evening meal, which was in the package, would be better. We were wrong!

We had good starters but the main meals were terrible, including a tarragon mouse stuffing that we could have played tennis with. The point being that the food in this hotel is very hit and miss.

All in all the hotel is ok as long as you eat somewhere else.",2,2008,02,19
213,Very poor standard 4*star,"The first time that I had experience of staff in this hotel was when I had to cancel one of the three nights that I had planned to stay.
The Reservations Manageress was one of the most abrubt people that I have ever encountered in the Tourism business, a business that I have many years experience of.
The Hotel itself had no atmosphere,poor front of house management, mediocre service ,staff seemed to be too frightened to be friendly.  
The only saving grace was the breakfast and even that at €21 a throw was over priced.
If you want to pamper yourself in a 4* Hotel in Dublin there is much better value available at less cost.
Its selling point seems to be its proximity to the RDS and boy do the Management seem to be smug about this.",1,2008,01,30
213,Noisy room,"Stayed many times in Dublin City Centre hotels but first time at Herbert Park.  Very handy for RDS event and wanted 4 star accomodation to return to.  Hotel clean and modern with standard 4 star rooms,  However found the room we had at back of hotel (odd numbers) to be very noisy due to generator/air conditioning plant's constant loud drone.  I started to imagine the bed was reverberating such was its loudness!  It would seem that the double glazing is of poor quality.  I was told there had been no complaints before and that I must therefore be mistaken!

Hotel is fine if you had a quiet room at front,  Don't book unless you are guaranteed an even numbered room on the other side of the hotel.",2,2007,12,27
213,Mixed Reviews,"This hotel was booked for us through my husband's company.  We arrived on the morning of November 22 and left November 25th.  We had previously been in London so right away we start to compare.  I would have to say our accomodations in London were excellent and the stay at Herbert Park was good.   As far as the hotel goes, the check in went very smoothly considering there were several groups of us.   It would have been nice if the person checking us in had told us that breakfast was included.  We found that out as we were checking out on our last morning there. Even after we even ate in the bar/lobby area!!  I also would have thought that the desk clerk would have told us how the light system worked.  You had to place your room key in a slot in order to get the lights to come on.  I have never seen this before.  It took us awhile but we finally figured it out.

There are places to walk to if you want to grab a bite to eat or go to the bank to exchange some money.  Seems like the hotel wasn't able to convert American Express Cheques.   We didn't travel with them but I guess other's did.

The first night we were there the electric went off about  6am and stayed off until around 10am.  Not only were you not able to have electric the water was also off.  I think this was a big disappointment even though it was not the fault of  the hotel.  It delayed us for our city tour that day but like I said it was no fault of the hotel and they handed out bottled water and did whatever they could to accomodate. 

The room ""323""  was clean but the heater was not working properly.  We had called to get someone to help us with it.  They sent housekeeping to check on it.  She got on a chair and put her hand and could feel that there was no heat coming out of the vent and said she would get someone up to correct it.  She mentioned that ever since the power failure that morning,  a few of the heating units were not working properly.  However this was never fixed, so I was always cold.

We had to call for ICE all the time as there are no ice making machines like in the States.   They would bring us a little pitcher of ice.  It would barely last us. I am thinking that the people in Ireland and England do not use ICE much as we had this same issue in London.

I also had a robe in the hotel in London and didn't have one in the hotel in Dublin.  It really isn't fair for me to compare the hotels because I had control over where we stayed in London and no control where we stayed in Dublin.   The room size was good.  The bathroom was OKAY... nothing spectaular.

Everytime we were in a cab we would ask the cab driver what he thought of the Herbert Park Hotel and the anwers were always positive, and good..  four star quality.  My husband and I were thinking just a cut below 4 Star Quality, but if we needed to come to Dublin again and we were booked at the Herbert Park Hotel we would come again.",4,2007,12,03
213,Terrible Service - Avoid this Hotel.,Very disappointing for a 4 star hotel - some of the rudest staff I have ever come across.  Don't waste your money here... you'd get better treatment at any other hotel in Dublin and it would cost you half the price.  Will NEVER go back.,1,2007,11,12
213,Great Place to Stay,"We have just arrived home after a lovely weekend in the Herbert Park Hotel in Dublin.  After reading some of the other reviews before we left, we were really not knowing what to expect and tried to keep our expectations quite low.  I must say we were very pleasantly surprised.  The hotel was absolutely beautiful, the rooms, bed-linen, bathroom all spotless and the staff couldn't have been more pleasant.  Breakfast was lovely and the whole stay was very relaxing.  Once we worked out the direction to walk in for the City Centre, we walked out and in - took about half an hour strolling but a very pleasant walk.  All in all we had a lovely stay and we would certainly recommend this hotel to anyone and would love to stay there again sometime - hopefully!",5,2007,11,01
213,A memorable and enjoyable visit,"Having just returned from a night's stay in the Herbert Park Hotel, I must say that my husband and I thoroughly enjoyed our stay.  From the moment we entered the hotel we were warmly greeted by the receptionists who were all very pleasant.  We had booked our room via their internet site and we were certainly not disappointed.  Our room was on the 4th Floor overlooking the Park and was indeed spacious and very welcoming.  Bath-robes were provided and we also availed of the stereo system.  On checking out the following day we were again warmly greeted by the receptionists and in particular Helen, who took care of our check-out in a very gracious manner.  Our car was parked in the basement car-park and when I mentioned that we would like to do some shopping and return for our car in a few hours, Helen assured me that the parking ticket would be validated at reception on our return.  I must add that we had the perfect stay in the Herbert Park and really looking forward to a return visit.
",5,2007,09,11
213,Very Disappointing Experience,"Our recent experience at the Herbert Park Hotel was very disappointing.  Our company booked a barbeque to facilitate a corporate event.   Despite the weather being fine, the event was held indoors in the restaurant and it would seem that no effort was made to host the barbeque outside in the patio area.  The variety of food and quality of food was extremely poor.  Food was pre-cooked and served from carvery type trays.  The event resembled a Sunday afternoon lunch rather than a summer barbeque.  

We made a number of efforts to address our concerns with hotel staff on the evening in question and later in writing to the General Manager.  However, staff and management were unable and unprepared to deal with or address our complaints.  

We will never use this hotel again and certainly would not recommend the Herbert Park Hotel for any type of function or event.
",1,2007,09,05
213,Disappointed,"I recently stayed in this hotel as I was attending a concert in the RDS Dublin.  The location was ideal as the RDS is right across the street.  On arriving to the hotel having to contact reception three times before we received the correct directions I was impressed the grounds are lovely and well kept and the reception area is impressive.  However after booking a double room I was disapointed to discover on entering the room ours was simply two twin beds pushed together.  We contacted reception but as it was taking too long for them to sort out the situation we decided to settle on the twin room.  On checking out I mentioned this and was simply told that there must have been a mistake in the booking (obviously)  I was not offered a discount.  Food was reasonable but overpriced.  Overall an ok stay was expecting more.
",3,2007,07,18
213,AWFUL - STAY AWAY - truly unpleasant,"Awful staff - could not be ruder!  It appeared that NOONE else was staying there.  The place feels empty - absolutely NO atmosphere - the lobby looks unfinished and very badly ""designed"" - if at all.  The park is wonderful, but the hotel gets no credit there - anyone can go to the park without staying here  All of the staff that I encountered should be fired - rude and somehow all had the same rude, uninterested look on their faces.  Would not even stay the night I had planned - went to the Four Seasons where four doormen welcomed me in where I encountered one nice person after another.   Not worth it at all - please do not go!
",1,2007,06,27
213,Very Nice Stay,"Spent 2 nights here with my wife on a weekend break.  The hotel is impressive with a large open plan reception/lounge area.  Christmas decorations were already up which gave the place an additional good feel.  Our room faced the main road in Ballbridge but we were on the 5th floor so no noise from traffic.  It was a large comfortable room with a double window.  We had breakfast there both mornings and it was great.  Our table overlooked the park and the buffet had everything you could ask for on offer.   The Bar is oddly laid out and not very welcoming but you can order drinks in the lounge also.  Also a good selection of nice pubs just outside the door.

The Hotel is really convenient with free underground parking.  Although signage from the main road can be easily missed.  It is also less than a minutes walk to Rolys Bistro which is fantastic restaurant but book well in advance.

Overall it was a great place to stay.  Hotel is Very clean, Staff were friendly (although not overly so) and its position is realy central.  Would highly recommend a stay there.",4,2006,12,29
213,Don't Go !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Avoid This Hotel !!!!!!!!!!!!!,"For anyone thinking about staying here - my advice is just DON'T GO!  There are plenty of superior hotels in the same area that will treat your custom with much more appreciation.  I am a frequent hotel user and this Hotel is by no means 4 star standard. In addition it's customer service is AWFUL.  When I arrived I had a problem with my room as it was not what I had booked/requested.  The room window was literally 1 foot from a full height wall outside - even though I had requested a room with a view of the Park.  Furthermore when I requested a room change the response I received was extremely negative and UNHELPFUL.  I actually took this issue (along with many other problems I encountered during my stay) up with management when I returned home via a written letter, and again might as well not have bothered. I was absolutely HORRIFIED by the absence of concern and customer care given.  It actually appeared that they had never been trained in customer relations.  The breakfast was DISGUSTING and I actually skipped it on my second morning.  Overall this hotel does not warrant it's cost and one would be far better off staying elsewhere where good customer service standards and food could be found.
",1,2006,12,19
213,Overnight business trip,"Stayed here on a business trip. Very impressive hotel with large public areas. The front desk staff were very efficient and some of our party were upgraded to spa rooms. The room was of a decent size and everything was of a high quality.  

Came back after dinner to have a drink at the bar and it had closed even though there were about a dozen people sitting in the very strangely designed bar area - think clearance sale from Ikea with no thought of what goes with what. One of the night managers ran a reduced bar service which was OK.

Apparently the breakfast was very good and this is certainly a good choice if staying in Dublin
",4,2006,12,05
213,"Fine,Just Fine.","I stayed at the Herbert Park for one night last month while visiting Dublin on business. The hotel was clean and bright and the staff were efficient. The bar and the lobby were totally empty and devoid of atmosphere. The food in the restaurant was fine but again there was no atmosphere.
The hotel is situated beside a lovely park which is handy if you want to take a jog or walk to releive you of boredom.
For a business traveller with work to do in the evening this hotel is adequate. For those seeking something more lively my advice is stay somewhere else.

213,"Good, efficient and clean hotel","The Herbert Park is a modern hotel, about 20 minutes walk from Dublin City centre. It has good bus and train links for those who don't like the walk.

The hotel seems new with a large reception area. Reception staff were friendly, quick and efficient - check-in took about two minutes. The rooms are large and comfortable, very clean and bright.

Bathrooms also clean with a good full-size bath.

The bar is a bit  soul-less but the staff were friendly despite having to serve a couple of obnoxious drunk tourists.

Within a minute's walk of the hotel there are a good selection of restaurants (Chinese, Thai, Italian, excellent Indian!) and a couple of nice little bars, so if you don't fancy the hassle of the city centre there's enough locally to satisfy most needs.

All-in-all, a good quality hotel in a beautiful part of Dublin with good rates.
",4,2006,10,09
213,Excellent,"Just back from long W/E with partner and 2 kids. Have to say value was excellent. The B/F was very tasty The Guinness in the bar wsa also Good.
The only complaint was the soul less atmosphere and the bar area being completely empty. So if you want value for money, good location and fine food then this place is for you. However if you are after a bit of Craic then best avoid
",5,2006,09,04
213,Anonymous place,"Stayed in the Herbert Park for a long weekend with family.

No complaints about the room (size, comfort etc), however we stayed on a Saturday and Sunday night and there was absolutely no atmposphere in the reception/ bar area of the hotel. There's a massive open reception/ bar area but there was nobody in it on a weekend evening and the lovely bar room was also empty!

It's located in the leafy Ballsbridge area. There is a very frequent bus service into the city centre and a taxi from Trinity College cost us 9 euros.

 We tried one of the restaurants (Italian) opposite the hotel 'Al Bruschetta' and can really recommend it

The Herbert park which is next to the hotel is also a lovely place to go for a walk.

Enjoyed our stay in Dublin as always, but perhaps we'll look for a hotel that is slightly more personable with some atmosphere.
",3,2006,08,01
213,Great Hotel,"I stay in the Herbert Park whenever I am in Dublin  I have always found it excellent staff are friendly and proffessional the rooms are spotless would highly recommend it to anyone
",5,2006,01,02
213,Avoid,"From the reception staff to the duty manager this place stinks of arrogance that has no place in the travel industry. I stayed here for a weekend break and expected luxury. Because I booked through an agency I was treated like a second class citizen from check in.  First impressions last. If you want to stay anywhere in Ballsbridge Dublin, do not give this hotel any of your hard earned cash. There are many other hotels in the area. Having stayed at Jury's, the Four Seasons and Bewleys you will indeed have a  better time. Jury's is a delight to stay in - friendly staff, helpful and puts the customer first. The 3 star Bewleys hotel puts this hotel to shame. The Four Seasons  shouldn't even be mentioned in the same breath as this obnoxious place, you pay for what you get: Unfortunately, you don't at the Herbert Park.  

The Herbert Park Hotel is cold, distant, unfamiliar has no character, and above all is very very unwelcoming. Oh, it does have a nice park, but you expect to be cold whilst walking outdoors not indoors. 

It's a shame that this place is representative of modern Irish society. I really think we have a lot more to offer.
",1,2005,11,29
213,Excellent property,"This is a beautiful and modern hotel and is probably best suited to business travelers. It is situated outside of the city center, about a 15-minute bus ride. The rooms are very well furnished and equipped. The airport bus stop is about a 5-minute walk from the hotel. The staff was very attentive and cooperative.
",5,2005,10,08
213,Excellent!!!,"Even though this hotel is an independently owned hotel, I had a much better experience than in other chain hotels.  I stayed there for 3 months and had an splendid stay.
Breakfast is excellent quality, with plenty to choose from. Lunch buffet is superb, and the a la carte menu is great (do not forget to try the penne pasta dish). If you are not satisfied enough with hotel food, just outside the door you will find a selection of the very best restaurants in Dublin. 
Italian: Evana and Al bruschetto
Chinese: Kites is the best, but there is another one, but can not remember the name
Pubs: 3 or 4 different ones
Thai: A couple within walking distance
There is also a Cuban (Bella Cuba), an Indian restaurant, Roly’s bistro (expensive but worth it) 
And my favorite the Donybrook Fair Café (is on Morehampot road)
As you can see, plety to choose from

The staff is very friendly and always willing to help.

The area is excellent, as long as it is located right in the middle of the Herbert Park, right on the Embassies district

I will definitely go back and recommend it
",5,2005,08,30
213,Enjoyed our stay at Herbert Park Hotel,"My husband, 16 yr-old daughter and I stayed here at the Herbert Park Hotel in July 2005.  We were booked there by my husband's employer. We paid E30 to upgrade to a 'family room' which was larger and contained both King and Twin beds. 
The room was nicely decorated, the bedding very comfy and the linens/amenities were generous. We were located on the second floor in the rear of the hotel. Our quiet room faced Herbert Park and we had lovely trees outside our window (I suspect the view from an upper floor would have been very nice).
There is a row of restaurants/pubs/shops just out of the front of the hotel and downtown Dublin was a quick taxi ride away. Since this is considered the 'Embassy District' the selection of cuisines was interesting! Skip breakfast at the hotel and go to the Insomnia Coffee Bar. 
The airport shuttle bus stops just steps away from the front door and costs E12 for a roundtrip ticket. 
We would not hesitate to stay here again.
Happy Trails!
",4,2005,07,25
213,A Park in the middle of Dublin,"We choose to stay at this hotel due to it's proximity to Lansdowne Road.  We booked directly with the hotel's web site at a rate of E125 room only including free car parking.
Public areas are very spacious and there is a park with ponds and birds immediately to the rear of the hotel.  A hotel with a park in the middle of Dublin!!
Bedrooms are well furnished but don't expect tea/coffee making facilities, in house movies or - my favourite gripe - Sky Sports.
We used the restaurant only once for dinner and had an excellent meal at a relatively reasonably cost.
This is a comfortable, efficient hotel that I would be happy to highly recommend.
",4,2005,05,08
213,Very good hotel,"We stay at this hotel quite often and have never been disappointed.
Staff very pleasant. Rooms very comfortable and clean. Beautiful location beside Herbert park. Quiet. Relaxing and enjoyable breakfast. Dinner in the Pavilion Restaurant was one of the best ever. Car parking free for guests. Good value all round.

213,Gone down hill!,"Hi,

I have stayed at this hotel for years. However recently I have found the desk staff and reservation system to be awful. I tried to complain at the desk and later through email, but it was a long and frustrating effort.
They have promised that they are to improve and retrain front desk staff, but it is too little too late for me.

It is a really nice hotel, but I feel that they need to work harder for their customers.

Thanks

213,"Good location, dismal breakfast","If you're travelling to Dublin and want a clean, quiet, place set apart from the expense of St. Stephen's Green and chaos of Temple Bar, consider the Herbert Park.
The rooms are clean and large enough.  Ask for a park view...our kids love the duck pond just down the footpath and Herbert Park is a great place to sit and have a picnic lunch on a sunny day.  Rest of the hotel is not terribly exciting, but if you're there as a tourist-on-the-move or on business, you won't have time to scrutinize the amenities anyway.
One problem that really stands out:  we had breakfast there this morning (not staying in the hotel this time, just in the area) and it was all kinds of terrible!  The buffet consisted of tinned fruit, bashed-in cereal packets and the mangiest scrambled eggs I've ever seen.  Even the orange juice had an uncertain twang to it...if you do stay, head just across the road to Insomnia coffee shop and grab yourself a bagel instead!
",3,2005,03,31
213,Oh I love this place !,"I loved this place. And here's why !  My husband and I stayed in it a while back because we were going to a Metallica concert at the RDS across the road. And although it was quite an upmarket hotel not one member of staff was snooty to us as we trundled about in our scruffy concert clothes.  So in other words, it was good old fashioned manners and hospitality, and you can't say fairer than that. Oh, and the hotel was lovely as well....

213,Nice Hotel,We got a great deal through Priceline for this 4-star hotel. Comfy bed and just a nice hotel. We walked from there to the Temple Bar district and Graften St (about 40 min walk). Insomnia across from the hotel is great to coffee or a sandwich too!,4,2003,09,02

Minuspunkt ist bei mir immer Duschvorhang. Duschen in der Badewanne mit Duschvorhang aus Plastik .. damit kann ich mich einfach nicht anfreunden.

Attualmente sono in corso dei lavori nell'edificio attiguo che ad ogni modo non hanno disturbato il mio soggiorno.
Il personale del ricevimento con cui mi sono trovata a collaborare si è sempre dimostrato gentile e disponibile, come il personale del ristorante.

213,STAFF RUDE / ESPERIENZA NEGATIVA,"Siamo stati 3 notti in questo hotel e sebbene fosse abbastanza decentrato aveva una bella camera. non abbiamo preso la colazione.
l'ultimo giorno abbiamo lasciato la stanza a mezzogiorno e siamo rientrati in hotel a mezzanotte per aspettare che fossero le quattro e andare in aeroporto.  la sala della hall ha circa una ventina di divani e a parte noi c'erano solo altre 3 persone sedute. abbiamo chiesto a questo signore vecchio acido scorbutico e maleducato che stava alla reception se potevamo fermarci per qualche ora lì (visto che fuori diluviava e si gelava) e lui ci ha fatto mille storie ma alla fine con stizza e sdegno ci ha lasciati accomodare.
da lì sono partite una serie di infinite ritorsioni e molestie nei nostri confronti: accensione di luci fortissime per evitare che ci addormentassimo, aria condizionata sparata al massimo per farci congelare, urla tra lui e gli altri 2 addetti alle pulizie della hall, cameriere che ci passava l'aspirapolvere attorno e ci domandava continuamente perche' fossimo seduti lì. alla fine sfiniti ci siamo spostati dalla sala dei divani per andare a sederci su due sedie a ridosso dell'uscita e non appena ci siamo seduti hanno immediatamente acceso le luci che hanno prontamente spento al momento dell'arrivo del nostro taxi.
mi dispiace tanto per come questi 3 signori abbiamo rovinato le nostre ultime ore a dublino con un sadismo ed una cattiveria ingiustificata.
pertanto il mio giudizio non può che essere negativo perchè questa gente va allontanata dallo staff. mai successa una roba del genere in tutta la mia vita da viaggiatore.",1,2018,06,21
213,Tariffe smisurate per un hotel misurato,"L'hotel Herbert è sicuramente un'ottima struttura: bello, accogliente, personale gentile, pulito, confortevole.

Tornerei? No, non a quei prezzi (190 euro al giorno per una singola con solo colazione inclusa).",3,2018,05,05

Il bar è molto carino, con tutta una serie di comodi divanetti per passare un po’ di tempo con amici/colleghi in compagnia di una buona Guinness.

213,"Hotel moderno, decentrato. Nella media, senza infamia e senza lode.",Ho soggiornato due notti per un congresso ospitato dallo stesso albergo. Camera non grande con letto molto comodo. Non sono previsti accappatoi e/o ciabattine; queste ultime le ho avute solo dopo richiesta esplicita al personale di piano. Bagno senza doccia ma con desueta vasca dotata di tendina antigienica. Naturalmente non esiste bidet. Apprezzata la possibilità di farsi Nespresso in camera. Confusione regna sovrana in sala colazione: un addetto alla reception accompagna ai tavoli senza sincerarsi se tavolo sia apparecchiato o meno. Il cameriere che arriva dopo si disinteressa. Lo standard della colazione è francamente inferiore (per i dolci) a quello minimo per alberghi di 4 stelle. Purtroppo nel convegno erano inclusi anche due pranzi e una cena (menù ripetitivo ed insapore) che consiglio vivamente di effettuare altrove. Fraintendimento iniziale con addetto al check-in (causa assenza responsabile delle prenotazioni in quanto domenica) non ha aiutato la valutazione. Ritengo ci possa essere di meglio a Dublino.

Das Personal wusste ""Service"" nicht nur zu schreiben...und die Freundlichkeit war nicht aufgesetzt, sondern kam ehrlich rüber! Immer wieder gerne!                          ",5,2017,08,04
213,Personal habla español,"Hola , estuvimos hace 2 semanas en este hotel con un grupo de amigos de Argentina, un hotel cerca de un parque , todo muy verde, habitaciones con cafetera de calidad, personal amable. Desayuno correcto. El hotel no es muy centrico para turismo pero esta bien ubicado para negocios. De todas formas precio calidad aceptable para hacer turismo. El personal que hablaba español era de gran ayuda sobretodo para entender los contenidos de las comidas  ,asi aproveco para dar gracias a Jose y Antonio 2 jovenes de España , muy amables.",5,2017,07,28
213,"Hotel con clase , personal habla español","Hola , estuvimos en este hotel en el mes de julio. Un buen servico, habitaciones confortables, personal muy amable en recepción. Además el personal habla español , ha ayudado mucho para que nuestra estancia fuera más amena. Agradezco a Jose y Antonio por sus ayudas no solo para comprender los menus sino  también por dar informaciónes breves sobre la ciudad.",5,2017,07,28
213,Comodo,"Estuve en el hotel del 22 al 25 de junio, el hotel,esta muy bien, las camas son muy cómodas, esta todo muy limpio, el desayuno muy correcto y variado.
La única pega es que esta un poco alejado como 30 minutos caminando hasta el Trinity College. Es un paseo agradable, por la noche regresabamos en taxi, unos 12 €.
Lo mejor sin duda el personal del hotel, son muy amables y eficientes, desde el personal de recepcion al del restaurante.....enhorabuena.",4,2017,06,26
213,Hotel carino e organizzato,"Hotel 4 stelle con tutti i comfort, pulito e molto ben organizzato.
Camera spaziosa con letto molto grande.
Un po' distante dal centro a piedi, circa 3 km, ma con autobus ogni pochi minuti e taxi sempre disponibili.
Unica pecca il costo della colazione: se non compresa costa 19,50€; in ogni caso sono presenti in zona molti locali e bar dove poter fare colazione.
In generale, buon rapporto qualità-prezzo. ",4,2017,04,18
213,Muy correcto,"Muy bien situado, atención perfecta y habitaciones muy cómodas y limpias. Desayuno abundante y con buenas vistas al parque. Fui por trabajo, está situado muy cerca del recinto ferial, puedes ir andando en 5 minutos",4,2017,01,29
213,Hotel carino,"Abbastanza vicino al centro città (20 minuti a piedi), stanza grande pulita e confortevole. Buona la colazione (suggerisco all'hotel di cominciare il servizio prima delle 7 per chi è in viaggio di lavoro)",4,2017,01,22
213,Ottima scelta,"Hotel pulito e funzionale, a 2 km a piedi dal centro e con molti buoni ristoranti vicino. Servito da autobus di linea e con taxi disponibili ad ogni ora. Ci siamo stati una settimana e ci ritornerei volentieri.",5,2017,01,03
213,Visita por trabajo,"El hotel cuenta con habitaciones muy cómodas, para descansar y trabajar. El wifi muy buena velocidad y cuentas con un escritorio cómodo. La cama es muy cómoda, algunas habitaciones tienen una bonita vista al exterior.  La comida tiene un buen precio alrededor de 15 euros. Es un poco retirado del centro se debe tomar taxi por unos 10-14 euros o bus por 2,7 euros, las estaciones del bus quedan a menos de una cuadra. Si piensas tomar un bus de turismo para recorrer la ciudad (tipo hop-on-hop-off), el rojo pasa cerca al hotel.
Hay servicio de cambio de moneda, sin embargo el cambio  en el hotel es menor que en banco o  en las oficinas de cambio de moneda. Sólo puedes cambiar 100 USD por día.",4,2016,09,21
213,Girovagando per l'Irlanda,"Hotel moderno in zona residenziale tranquilla e ben curata, ma un poco decentrato rispetto al centro della città. Stanza molto ampia che oltre a tutti i confort offriva anche la  macchina per caffè nespresso con ampia scelta di caffè e the. Personale reception molto disponibile che in pochi minuti ci ha cambiato la stanza assegnateci perche non era di nostro gradimento , una menzione particolare al sig. Lukas Kluzo in servizio notturno alla reception per la disponibilità e la cordialità dimostrata oltre al supporto logistico per il mancato arrivo in orario del nostro transfer per l'aeroporto.
Ottima la colazione a buffet con ampia scelta e disponibilità di dolce e salato.",5,2016,08,12
213,tour irlanda,ottimo albergo pulito e funzionale nella via delle ambasciate ci sono stato per 2 notti prima del mio ritorno in italia un po lontano dal centro ma servito da autobus colazioni abbondanti internazionali e irlandesi personale gentile c'e' anche personale italiano che in alcuni casi aiuta ad intendersi,4,2016,08,09
213,Ruhiges Business Hotel am Park,"War geschäftlich für ein paar Nächte in diesem Hotel. Ist noch in direkter Nähe zur Innenstadt, so das man diese bequem zu Fuß erreichen kann. Um die Ecke ist auch noch ein richtig guter Irish Pub, wo man sehr gut und günstig essen kann. Das Hotel selbst ist nicht günstig, aber doch im Rahmen und vor allem sehr sauber. Personal ist sehr freundlich. Allerdings kommen teilweise die Touristen gleich Busse weise an und man muss beim Einchecken ein wenig Zeit mitbringen",4,2016,08,08
213,Business mit City verbinden,"Die Lage ist total gut. Verkehrstechnisch kann man das Zentrum umfahren, ist aber in wenigen Minuten zu Fuß in der City. Croke Park für Veranstaltungen wie auch RDS sind fußläufig erreichbar.
Die Zimmer sind gut ausgestattet. Da es diesmal ein aussergewöhnlicher Sommer war störten nur die >Kühlanlagen vor dem Fenster.
Frühstück ist super. Service auf hohem standard.",4,2016,07,25
213,Unaufgeregtes Business-Hotel,"Für Geschäftsreisende ist das Hotel völlig in Ordnung. Privat fände ich das Ambiente etwas lieblos und die Lage nicht berauschend, wenn man das Zentrum Dublins sehen möchte. Die Mitarbeiter waren leider etwas gelangweilt. Sauberkeit im Zimmer war insgesamt gut. Preis für deutsche Verhältnisse viel zu hoch, für Dublin aber wohl OK.",3,2016,06,27
213,soggiorno per un convegno,"Bellissima camera, letto king size, acqua sempre disponibile e macchina nespresso con varia scelta di caffè e the. Pulito, moderno, ottimo per un soggiorno anche di lavoro. Non è al centro di Dublino ma la zona è tranquilla e ben curata",4,2016,06,08
213,Nicht so gutes Preisleistungsverhältnis,"Wir waren eine Woche in Dublin im Herbert Park Hotel.
Der anschliessende Park ist super und wunderschön.
Die Zimmer im Hotel sind etwas heruntergekommen, der Service mit den Pralines (täglich) ist zwar nett, hat aber nicht immer funktioniert.
Der TV hatte ein schlechtes Bild, weil der Stecker am Gerät verschlissen war.
Das Zimmer hat eine eigene Kaffeemaschine, was super ist.
Ansonsten wäre eine Zimmerrenovation nötig für den verlangten Preis",2,2016,06,05
213,Buon hotel per viaggi di lavoro,"L'hotel non è centralissimo, per arrivare a piedi a Grafton Street ci vuole una mezz'ora. 
L'area è tranquilla e l'hotel confina con un bel parco.
Le camere sono grandi, moderne e confortevoli. 
Molto buona e varia la colazione. 
Wifi a disposizione gratuitamente. ",4,2016,03,23
213,Excelente Desayuno,"El hotel es muy bueno, tienen excelente atención, las habitaciones son amplias, el bar es un un poco frio.  Lo mejor es el desayuno.  Le daría una calificación de excelente a este hotel si estuviese más cerca del centro, pero esta en un barrio lindo y Dublin tampoco es tan grande.  Para mi gusto la decoración y todo es muy serio muy ingles, pero es excelente el hotel, regresaría.",4,2016,02,08
213,Elegante y acogedor ,"Vinimos a este hotel porque esta situado al lado de un evento al que asistíamos. Muy acogedor, habitaciones espaciosas. El desayuno deja un poco que desear.

Tiene un salón lounge muy apropiado para conversaciones de negocios o para pasar un rato. 

Nos salió caro no obstante por estar situado al lado de evento.",4,2015,11,05
213,IMPRESIONANTE - EXCELENTE,"No duden en elegir este hotel. Está ubicado en la zona de las embajadas. No está cerca de Temple bar, pero es un hotel para disfrutar, en una ciudad hermosa. Tiene una calidad hotelera muy sobre la media. Tienen una decoración y un nivel de personal de front desk, realmente profesional. Las habitaciones son preciosas, equipadas, de buen gusto, Con unos baños impresionantes. Tuvieron la amabilidad de otrorgarnos una habitación intercomunicada con la de mis hijos que hizo muy cómoda la estadía y nuestro descanso. Un hotel espectacular para no perder en Dublín.",5,2015,10,25
213,"Cómodo, agradable y acogedor","Tras cuatro viajes a Dublín alojándome aquí, sólo puedo hablar bien de este hotel. El personal siempre ha sido atento y colaborador conmigo. Las habitaciones son correctas, aunque en algunas se nota algo más de ruido exterior que en otras. El desayuno es bueno, con bastante variedad para elegir, y el gimnasio, pese a no ser grande, es bastante completo para ejercitarse.",4,2015,10,08
213,Un hotel para estar comodo punto .,"Tuve la suerte por distintas causas de estar en una suite espectacular , sin embargo me parecio que los cuartos std eran chicos al  verlos caminando por el corredor . El hotel es bueno y el servicio tambien sin destacarse . El desayuno esta bien pero tampoco sobresale . La localizacion es buena . Recomiendo verificar medidas en metros cuadrados de las habitaciones . Menos de 26 m2 ni pensarlo .... no va . Van fotos de suite parkview . ",4,2015,09,21
213,Hotel nella media,"Albergo nella media. Camere pulite e spaziose, purtroppo con la moquette (un po' consumata e un po' macchiata), cosa che sinceramente non mi fa impazzire.
Personale cordiale.
Colazione con ampia scelta di dolce e di salato.
Zona tranquilla e possibilita' di raggiungere il centro anche a piedi (con una buona camminata).",3,2015,09,10
213,Valoración hotel ,"Es un hotel bien ubicado y en muy buenas condiciones. Es lamentable que nuestra experiencia de haya opacado por advertir que para prestar un plato y un par de cubiertos (sin comida, obviamente) pretendían cobrar €6,50. La celeridad para los trámites de check out fue impecable. Por ultimo, no se justifica pagar la diferencia entre habitaciones, ya que la diferencia eran unos pocos metros y unos chocolates de bienvenida. ",4,2015,09,06
213,Buen hotel lejos del centro,"Es un hotel correcto, habitaciones amplias para Europa, la atención del staff es buena, wifi bueno pero realmente esta lejos del centro, hay que tomar un bus (7 o 4) que te lleva 10-15 minutos. Caminando se tarda45 minutos .
Por otro lado les solicitamos unos platos y nos quisieron cobrar 6,5 € por UN PLATO Y UN TENEDOR Y UN CUCHILLO, increíbles un te quieran cobrar por eso.
",3,2015,09,06
213,Muy confortable y moderno,"Este hotel es tranquilo, confortable y moderno. Vestíbulos y salones amplios. El salón principal es muy luminoso y da a Herbert Park. El desayuno es tipo bufet, con amplia variedad de platos calientes, fríos y bollería y repostería. Está lejos del centro, junto a la embajada americana. Hotel muy recomendable.",4,2015,08,28
213,BUEN HOTEL,"Hotel moderno y confortable,  las habitaciones amplias y muy luminosas. Las amenities muy completas y de buena calidad. Por ponerle una pega es que está un poco lejos del centro de la ciudad, en una zona residencial lo que obliga a utilizar transporte para llegar al centro. No se entiende que en un hotel de esta categoría no ofrezcan servicio de cafe/te gratuito en las habitaciones como ocurre con otros hoteles.",4,2015,07,28
213,Buon albergo con ottimo personale,"Ho dormito solo due notti in questo albergo molto confortevole e comodo per la sua accettabile distanza percorribile a piedi dal centro città. L' aereo di rientro in Italia era alle 7 del mattino con sveglia alle 4! A tal proposito un plauso a Davide, il portiere che, con la sua professionalità e cortesia, ha reso questa levataccia più accettabile. Mi ha infatti organizzato una inaspettata prima colazione che ha migliorato il mio umore e fatto affrontare molto meglio la giornata",4,2015,07,17
213,ottima scelta per viaggi di lavoro,"hotel perfetto per viaggi di lavoro. ubicato a ballsbridge, zona delle ambasciate molto bella. pulito e moderno considerando i canoni degli hotel irlandesi. camere spaziose, e silenziose. Unica pecca: il sistema di aria condizionata. Spento perchè rumorso.",4,2015,05,22
213,perchè non tornarci?,"l'hotel si trova in una zona tranquilla vicino all'ambasciata americana, a circa 25 minuti a piedi dal centro.
E' un hotel confrotevole, molto luminoso. Le camere non sono molto grandi ma anche queste luminose, l'arredamento è semplice ma funzionale.
Il ristorante affaccia sul parco. La cucina ottima come pure la colazione servita sempre nello stesso ristorante.",4,2014,09,22
213,Magnifico hotel! digno de un 4 estrellas!,"Es un hotel muy grande, es un lujo su interior, posee estacionamiento. Si bien no está cerca de la ciudad, si se en auto lo recomiendo, y sino caminen! porque la verdad lo vale, ya que en Dublín los hoteles que están en el centro salen lo mismo que este, y no son tan buenos. 
La habitación era gigante, el baño era un lujo, con smart tv, frigobar, calefacción, la cama era un sueño! Realmente lo recomiendo! me encanto! No lo duden!",5,2014,08,27
213,Adatto per chi viaggia per lavoro,"Questo hotel si affaccia su un bellissimo parco, dal quale prende il nome. E' l'ideale per chi viaggia per lavoro ed infatti è più vicino al quartiere in cui hanno sede le principali multinazionali informatiche rispetto al centro città. Le camere sono particolarmente grandi ed accoglienti ed il personale è molto professionale.",4,2014,08,19
213,Per lavoro,Siamo stati in questo albergo in quanto vicino al luogo in cui ci sarebbe stata la riunione. Ottima accoglienza. Camera  grande ed accessoriAta anche di prese per cell e ipad. Ottima ed abbondante la colazione. grande varietá.,4,2013,09,24
213,"Hotel di medie dimensioni, ben posizionato","Tutto adeguato a quello che un hotel per viaggi di affari dovrebbe offrire.
Chiaramente Dublino non e' una metropoli ne' offre molti sfoghi rispetto agli incontri di lavoro (o forse non li ho cercati/trovati).
La struttura non e' mastodontica, quindi non e' troppo spersonalizzata, la collocazione nei pressi del parco offre possibilita' di godersi un po' di verde, cosi' come di raggiungere area per la cena a distanza pedonabile (tempo permettendo).
Il ristorante offre piatti di buona qualita' a prezzi non economici, attenzione all'obbligo di consumare almeno due portate (mi e' capitato raramente e ogni volta mi sorprende).
Camere ok, zona molto tranquilla, area colazione luminosa con vista sul parco che puo' far iniziare bene la giornata, soprattutto se c' e' il sole e non e' inverno.
Rapporto qualita' prezzo buono.",4,2013,05,10
213,Professionell,"Empfang, Zimmerservice und Frühstück sind auf einem attraktiven Level. Die Lage des Hotels ist gut, die Empfangshalle sowie die übrigen Lokalitäten grosszügig gehalten. Die EU-Präsidentschaft Irlands hat zu einem grossen Bekanntheitsgrad geführt, weil alle Delegationen dort untergebracht sind.",4,2013,04,29
213,"Muy bueno, moderno, bien ubicado","Es un hotel confortable, todo esta en buen estado, tiene mucha luz, lo q es importante en Dublin, el desayuno es deliciosos, esta ubicado frente a un parque ideal para salir a hacer ejercicio. 
Lo unico malo e la television, tiene muy pocos canales y no tiene cable, así q hay q ver solo televisión local",4,2012,10,09
213,Ein gutes und ruhiges Hotel in Dublin,"Wir haben ein ruhiges Hotel in Dublin gesucht und es gefunden: Das Herbert Park Hotel wird sehr gut geführt, das Zimmer, das wir bewohnten war groß und gemütlich. Empfangs- und Zimmerservice-Personen waren sehr freundlich, bis auf eine Ausnahme. Das Hotel liegt an einem Park, d.h. es ist wirklich angenehm ruhig rundherum. Allerdings muß man den Bus nehmen, wenn man in die Innenstadt will. Diese Busse fahren im Zehn-Minuten-Takt und auch der Bus vom bzw. zum Flughafen ist leicht erreichbar.",5,2010,09,19
213,Herbert Park Hotel - Entspannung in Dublin,"Ich LIEBE das Herbert Park Hotel in Dublin. Es befindet sich in Ballsbridge, in einer ruhigen Ecke von Dublin. Direkt am Hotel befindet sich der Herbert Park, der ideal zum joggen nach einem harten Arbeitstag ist. Die Dart (Bahn in Dublin) ist zu Fuß zu erreichen; das Hotel hat somit eine sehr gute Verkehrsanbindung. Das Frühstück ist genial, das Personal sehr hilfsbereit und freundlich. Auf Wunsch bekommt man Eier in allen Variationen. Die Zimmer sind sehr nett und geräumig.",5,2010,07,05
