53,A gem in Barcelona,"Literally one of the most beautiful places we have ever stayed.  Having all of the modern amenities while in this lovely historical building.  The hotel staff was very gracious, and even when we arrived early due to our international flight was able to hold our luggage while we found something to eat.  Valeriia Uryuskaya assisted us with dinner reservations at Bar Mut which was absolutely perfect for our family.   We would definitely stay here again.",5,2024,07,12
53,Train rumble every 10-15 mins,"The hotel is beautiful and the facilities are generally well maintained, although ergonomic compromises were made in service of design that grew increasingly uncomfortable. For example, the unconventional bathroom faucet and shallow sink meant that the faucet can only be turned on slightly or else water would bounce off the sink and flood the floor. Other inconveniences include a centralized AC that can only be adjusted by calling reception.

But the big drawback here is the periodic, room shaking rumble from the subway trains passing below. The hotel is right above a major station, which is great for taking that subway line, but not so great if you're trying to get some sleep while jetlagged and not used to have a rattle every 10-15 minutes that lasts till 1am and later on weekends. I wish the other reviews had mentioned this when I was doing my research.",3,2023,07,15
53,Amazing stay in heart of the city! ,"The building , the rooms , the staff ... they were all amazing! Best choise ever! Situated in the heart of the city, a quiet part of Paseig de Gracia in comparison to the lower part. The staff was amazing, very helpfull and always trying to meet your desires. The atmosphere from El Palauet surrounds your heart and transcends to a different time and place. It‚Äôs like you are reliving the early 20th century with all the novelty and technology from nowadays. We were truely mesmerised with the place! We will definetly return! Try it! At least once! You won‚Äôt regret it! It‚Äôs a place you‚Äôll remember for the rest of your life! Congratulations to all the team from El Palauet and many thanks for making our short stay so amazing!",5,2019,03,24
53,Stylish and personal,"It is really an upmarket serviced apartment, more than a hotel - but the rooms are so large and beautifully designed, so Catalonian and comfortable, we wished we spent more time here to be honest. 24/7 concierge, they cooked us breakfast and bought us food on arrival after a long haul flight, staff were great. 
A great place to stay that really feels like you're in Barcelona, instead of some chain hotel where you could be anywhere. Had 2 kids with us and they loved it too. Easy walk to so many of Barcelonas major attractions. I'd stay again.",5,2018,10,17
53,A beautiful apartment in the perfect location!,"We just spent 5 nights right on Passeig de Gr√†cia, in one of the most beautiful buildings dating back to 1902. The mix is heritage and modern with all the technology at your fingertips. Our 150m2 suite was beautifully decorated with painted relief ceilings, stained glass windows, mirrored kitchens, crisp and comfortable beds, rain showers and tub and... balconies over looking the street. We couldn‚Äôt have asked for more. The service was great, from the team (and our Ed Sheehan lookalikeüòÅ) always eager to assist. Best location, super easy to get anywhere from here, what a proper spot. 
Barcelona you are amazing, and El Palauet...we will be back.",5,2018,06,06
53,Poor experience,"1. No hot water in shower
2. Phone broken
3. No one at front desk most of the time
4. Laundry returned damp

Completely disorganized place - ever see Fawlty Towers? This is it. Think of it as a poorly run bed and breakfast.

dd in terms of experience or recommendations and seem generally indifferent.

Thanks

53,Check Major Building Works Next Door Have Finished Before Booking,"We stayed in the Principal Passeig de Gracia 24-271017.

We would concur with the majority of the comments below.  The hotel apartment concept is excellent and rare (depending on your view of Airbnb) and El Palauet does it well in Barcelona.  Location, quality and size are commensurate with the cost.  There are issues with the privacy of the en-suites (gaps, glass, mirrors and limited doors) and confusion over what is and what is not included in breakfast when breakfast is part of the deal, but these are subjective and solvable respectively.

Sadly, our 3 night stay was marred by the major renovation works next door.  The masonry drilling and jack hammers start at 0800 and continue to reverberate periodically until 1630; interspersed with deliveries of skips, building supplies and so on.  Sleep is impossible beyond 0800.  I would guess that this work will be going on for months if not a year given the size and scope.

El Palauet just seem resigned to the disruption but I'm not sure guests paying their rates would take the same view.",3,2017,10,27
53,Fantastic -- so memorable.,"My husband and I stayed in Principal Passeig de Gracia apartment from July 16 - 20, 2017. I cannot say enough about how wonderful the staff and apartment were. They took care of every need we had -- even hand-delivering two of the jute tote bags to us at our next hotel in Barcelona! Julia, Maria, and Christian ALL were absolutely superb, providing champagne, dinner upon request, making museum reservations, booking a full-day tour with driver, buying us flowers for our anniversary, making restaurant reservations, etc.  Plus the apartment! By far the most gorgeous in which we've ever stayed anywhere!

We are already fantasizing about taking another trip to Barcelona and bringing friends with us to El Palauet.  We cannot recommend it more highly!",5,2017,07,31
53,Quaint Hotel in the heart of town,"Stunning building with original features, but I would say it operates more as a bed and breakfast rather than hotel. There is no dining space or bar space and breakfast is ordered the night before and prepared for you in your room-which can create some timing issues-you don't get breakfast in one go,rather dribs and drabs. Open plan en-suite with Toto toilet. And yes, the  sink tap does soak you and the floor when you open it",4,2017,05,01
53,A magical home away from home in the heart of Barcelona!,"El Palauet is just an incredibly special place. The boutique hotel is situated in the heart of the chic Gracia neighborhood in the heart of Barcelona, just a short walk from countless main attractions, including a less than a 5 minute walk to two of Gaudi's famous masterpiece buildings on the Passeig de Gracia, where the hotel sits. 

The design of the entire building and each suite is immaculate - classical architecture meets modern amenities, to make for the most memorable stay. Not only are there outdoor spaces inside each 1,600 sq foot suite (literally, there is no bad room in the hotel!), but the hotel also has an amazing rooftop terrace - perfect for morning breakfast and an evening cocktail. The staff is incredible and discrete - it's a perfect fusion of all the services you need without any unnecessary disturbances. 

This charming landmark hotel quickly became my favorite hotel of all time and I couldn't recommend it more highly!",5,2017,03,26
53,Designer home away from home !,"Stop looking you can't find better in Barcelona!  It has the convenience and space of an apartment with the service of a hotel but much more personal. We stayed for a week with our teenage children in one apartment and our extended family in another apartment of the first floor. Principal Gracia and Principal Tibidabo. The rooms were beautiful original details on the walls and ornate ceilings with designer furniture and mod cons of aircon and blinds controlled by the iPad.

It is in a great location central but slightly out of the busy tourist area with good restaurants nearby. It was completely quiet at night with the double glazing and shutters give complete block out the light.  The staff make it really special. They are such nice people and incredibly helpful. Nothing is too much trouble. It really is a personal valet service. They made all our restaurant bookings and all their recommendations were excellent. 

They did a shop before we arrived from our list and even offered to make me soup when I was sick. They were wonderful. A fabulous stay. I couldn't recommend it more highly. ",5,2016,10,02
53,Beautiful hotel and wonderful staff,"We stayed at El Palauet for four nights and had a great experience.  We are a family of four and the two bedroom suite was perfect.  When searching for hotels in Barcelona (and Europe in general) it was very hard to find a hotel that would put a family of four in one suite.  I was very happy to find El Palauet!  We stayed in the Principal Tibidabo suite and it was more than enough space for four people.  The living area is spacious and comfortable with a wall of beautiful stained glass windows.  The dining area was also spacious and we enjoyed many meals there.  We had the hotel breakfast and we also ordered room service for dinner once (the hotel doesn't have a kitchen so room service is from nearby restaurants).  The service is fantastic, our concierge helped set up the food onto plates and set up the table for us.  Having a kitchen is extremely helpful when traveling with kids and this kitchen was well equipped with a small range, microwave, full size refrigerator and dish washer.  I think there was an oven too.  Pots, pans, plates, cups were plentiful.  Of course, there is also a espresso machine.  There was a complimentary bottle of red as well.  The details in all the rooms are beautiful.  The bathtub is probably the biggest bathtub I've ever been in.  My kids loved it!  The beds are quite comfortable and the room faces the back so was not too noisy.  One thing to note is that both bathrooms are ensuite and there is no wall separating the bedrooms from bathrooms.  It was OK for us since we are a family, but might be awkward for friends traveling together.  There were a couple of kinks during our stay (mainly AC related), but once we brought them to the hotel staff's attention, they were quick to address/fix the issues.  The location is very convenient, close to many shops, restaurants and the Gaudi buildings.  The rooftop is gorgeous as well.  It was too hot for the hot tub or steam room but we enjoyed the view.  My son loved the fact that it was close to many Pokestops :) Beautiful hotel in a beautiful city, would definitely stay here again.",5,2016,08,18
53,Beautiful Boutique Hotel,"Hotel is located on the high end of the main road. Great customer service, 15min walk from Sangrada Familia. 5min walk to cafe & restaurants. Superb customer service, the rooftop is an amazing place to watch the sunset. Would definitely recommend to someone who likes shopping at the big brand stores i.e. Gucci, Hermes etc, they are at your doorstep...",5,2016,08,18
53,The Secret you want to share!,"We went to the Secret terrace, a wonderful rooftop bar accessed only by emailing and getting a secret code.

The setting is stunning. High enough to overlook the whole of Barcelona we listened to the dulcet tones of an amazing singer and drank gin and tonic to our hearts content.

Prices are quite high but no more than any other terrace and worth it for the exclusivity. Intimate with excellent service. All the staff are fantastic in particular Lorna whose brain child the Secret garden is.

Perfect for a romantic evening, family get togethers and nights out with friends. A hidden gem for tourists and locals alike.",5,2016,08,11
53,Made our trip and we will be back - the perfect balance of luxe hotel and apartment,"I never write reviews but feel compelled to.  El Palauet leaves no stone unturned and the quality of the rooms was exceptional, the staff are so friendly and this place offers the best of hotel and privacy. l.  we want with our son and it was great that we were able to have privacy, with a living room between the two bedrooms; both so well equipped and beautifully designed. the location is superb and the staff are like family; guiding you just enough for you to feel you are in a home from home.  i have stayed in many hotels and this has been the best city hotel cum apartment i have every stayed in.  it went beyond my expectations.  it rained the whole time we were in Barcelona but the room made our stay worth every minute as it was just so special. i could go on but will leave you with beautiful hotel, stunning rooms, right in the heart of the city.",5,2016,07,31
53,This Place is Over the Top,"Stop looking. This is the best stay in Barcelona. There is no comparison. This is it. Food, service, location. There're is nothing better. Beautiful hotel, attentive service, everything you want in a five star boutique hotel. I would live here if I could!
",5,2016,07,22
53,Average stay,"Just an average experience at this very picturesque hotel.  The late 19th century building is contrasted with ultra contemporary furnishings offering a unique and interesting d√©cor.  Rooms are well appointed with comfortable beds and full kitchens.  Unfortunately this is where the positive experiences ended for me.  This hotel offered inconsistent service.  We often felt deserted, no staff available to assist with arrangements when needed.  Turn down service one night, but not the next, missing toiletries and non-functioning sink in bathroom.  For a 5-star hotel our stay was disappointing.",3,2016,07,21
53,Amazing place,I can't recommend this hotel more.  It is a beautiful boutique hotel with amazing architecture on the outside and inside.  Staff is very friendly.  They went above and beyond the call of duty.  Amazing location in the heart of the high shopping district.  Very safe location.  McDonald's around corner for kids.  Hundreds of restaurants within walking distance.  Worth the money. ,5,2016,07,18
53,Great stay in Barcelona!,"We had a great stay at the El Palauet ""Little Palace"" in Barcelona. The building which was built in 1906, is beautifully renovated with 6 huge apartments, so it feels very exclusive. We needed a place to stay with 2 bedrooms and El Palauet is much better than staying in a hotel in 2 separate rooms. It is also better than rental apartments because it is staffed and feels more like a hotel. 

Apartments:
Beautiful 2 bedroom apartment with high ceiling and doors opening to Passeig de Gracia if you are facing the front street. Each bedroom also has its own bathroom and TV. Between the 2 bedrooms is a large living room with TV. There is also a small kitchen with dining table (and TV) opposite the entrance. In each bedroom there is also a large wardrobe which is great for long stays. I have to say this is the best 2 bedroom apartment I've ever stayed in. 

Location: 
It is just at the corner of Av Diagonal at Place de Joan Carles. It's walking distance to all the restaurants and shops on Passeig de Gracia. It also has an advantage of being near the more residential area of Gracia, so you have all the facilities like supermarkets, laundry and local restaurants/shops. We walked everywhere, didn't use the subway but did get a taxi to go to airport, Barceloneta and Camp Nou. 

Facilities: 
The rooftop and spa is wonderful! It's like an oasis up there. 

Service: 
Everyone was helpful and friendly. Each suite has a personal assistant that can help arrange anything. There is also room service from nearby restaurants and also breakfast can be ordered. 

We had an apartment facing Passeig de Gracia and didn't think the Metro noise was that noticeable as per previous reviews. It is in the city after-all so you'd expect normal city noises. I wasn't bothered by the charges for coffee, mini bar etc .. that is the same for all hotels around the world. Just because you pay more for the room (which is justified as it really feels like a 5-Star hotel), surely does not mean everything should be all inclusive. 

Overall a great stay and we would love to come back again to stay in this beautiful apartment!! I would recommend El Palauet to anyone as it is a much better alternative to staying in hotels (particularly for families) as you really ""feel"" like you are living in the city, and can cook your own meals or easily go out to all the great places to eat around the area.",5,2016,07,12
53,Perfect for couples or family,"We stayed at El Palauet for 5 nights in May 2016.  We were two couples traveling together and El Palauet was perfect because the room was enormous with a huge, usable common area and two very nice, well-appointed bedrooms.  Each room in the hotel is basically a two-bedroom apartment with a fridge, freezer and wine fridge.  The location of the hotel is perfect, right at the top of the Passeig de Gracia (or bottom of La Gracia).  

The staff was very friendly and attentive and was helpful in making reservations and with recommendations of things to do.  If I were to travel to Barcelona again with either another couple of my family, I would certainly try to stay at El Palauet.",5,2016,06,06
53,Fantastic suite living,"This is a fantastic small hotel, made up exclusively of two bedroom suites, with your own living room, dining room and kitchen.  It's in a great location for transport, being close to Diagonal station and the top of Las Ramblas but still within walking distance of the city centre.  We visited for a long weekend as two couples so it was ideal.  Reception/concierge staff cannot do enough to help with the stay, arranging attraction tickets, booking cabs, booking restaurants, whatever you need, and are all really friendly.  The suite itself is truly exceptional with loads of space and loads of character.  The web photos really are a true reflection of how good the place is.  The roof terrace and spa is a great spot to relax after sightseeing- we had it pretty much to ourselves for the whole stay.  On the face of it, this suite is a bit pricey but, compared to the price of two rooms in a similar quality hotel, it actually represents really good value.  Can't recommend highly enough.",5,2016,06,02
53,Over priced and underwhelming.,"What you get for your money is a room...period. Not even complimentary tea and coffee. Everything else you pay through the nose for.
The room looked very tired in places, paint chips off the doors and the odd stain on the furniture and carpet.
Very well located, and a lovely roof terrace.
Nowhere near worth the price paid though, poor value for money, nice but not that nice.
Save yourself a lot of money and go full board in any of the other good quality hotels in Barcelona, Hotel Dante is very nice.",4,2016,04,25
53,Good Times in Barcelona,"The stay was picked out by some good friends, we were so glad we went for it.
El Palauet is a great place to stay and see Barcelona with friends. 
It is our first time staying in an apartment hotel, and it will be hard for us to top this experience.
Third time visiting Barcelona and I'm sure we'll be back, great place, great people.",5,2016,04,20
53,Lux,"Lovely place, huge apartment, great kitchen and dinning area, huge bath and rain showers. Everything was spotless. Staff lovely. Building beautiful.
Roof terrace lovely with very hot tub to relax in. 
The apartment was great fun to stay in, we felt like movie stars, luxurious furnishings, super comfy beds with memory foam pillows etc, it's all high tech, good wifi and a Bluetooth sound system. Lighting, blinds, sound etc all controlled by an iPad system. loved it all, a couple of the group couldn't get to grips with how to turn things on and off but we found that quite funny! We had a great little sunny balcony too. Bathrooms had Aveda cosmetics, kitchen kitted out with a massive fridge and Miele cooking appliances, we got fresh food from the market and cooked a few times, the dining area is lovely, 4 adults in a 2 bed apartment and there was plenty of space for us all to relax properly. We all loved the place and would happily go back. Highly recommended ",5,2016,04,19
53,Fabulous place to stay,"I don't normally write reviews for places but the wonderful experience we had at El Palauet warranted it.  The hotel was amazing, it has been done up to such exacting standards, retaining all of the exquisite original features, just look up to all the ceilings to see intricate mouldings and detailed carvings, but with all the needs of modern day luxury - controllable lights, heating and music in every room along with sumptuous contemporary furniture.  Right at the top there was a lovely spa with jacuzzi, sauna and plenty of luxury loungers even though it was a bit cold in February.  

The staff couldn't do more to help either serving all needs within the apartments or providing excellent recommendations of place to see or somewhere to eat catering for all pallets and all wallets.

I would certainly return to this place, it is so important that such independent places remain, which have their own character, but also amazing quality to beat any high end well known hotel and without any of that sterile feeling that you could be anywhere.",5,2016,02,22
53,Beautiful boutique hotel,"Incredibly beautiful two bedroom suite in this gorgeous hotel. All the modern luxuries. Young, vibrant staff...thank you Elizabeth, Lorna, Christian and the others whose names I do not remember. Your recommendations were spot on. We had the best time and will definitely return.",5,2016,01,04
53,Stunning modernista house ,"We loved having the chance to stay in such a grand apartment on one of the best roads in the city. The interior is truly stunning. The principal Tibidabo suite has two beautiful bedrooms, two bathrooms , beautiful living area and very well stocked kitchen . The living room has the most beautiful semi circular stained glass window . The Lighting / electric blinds enhance the look. 

The staff were very helpful . We had breakfast and dinner in the suite as we wanted to make the most of our stay in this fabulous place. This was well presented/ tasty  and provided as room service . The fridge is fully stocked with wine , drinks and milk. You will want for nothing here. It's great ! 

You can hear  the underground but this didn't really bother us as the beauty of the place combined with the fantastic service meant , for us , that this didn't matter. 

We were so impressed, we've already booked a return trip ! ",5,2015,12,02
53,A mother and son weekend in Barcelona...novices to the city,"The service in El Palauet was exceptional. They took care of out every need, helped us plan our days, made bookings for entry tickets, dinners and all that we needed. The suite was so clean and welcoming and the terrace was perfect. A huge thank you to all staff there for all your help. We would highly recommend this as a place to stay for couples or families. Many thanks from Ned and Sandra, October 2015.",5,2015,10,11
53,Very nice,"Very nice place to ""Living Barcelona"". Incredible building of circa 1900 with new design and furniture, except the new concept of ""open bathroom"" which I do not like at all, everything is ok. Excellent people at the front desk. The location is perfect. ",4,2015,04,23
53,Spot-on location ; a hidden address with charm but some glitches...,"My fisrt impression of the 2 bedroom apartment we had was that it was fabulous! A classic early 20th century building built by an architect , a contemporary of Gaudi , that fascinates! The interior is modern, sleek and high tech. And here is where the problems start. Once inside we had trouble with most of this high tech technology that refused to work for us. We had problems with the heater, the phones, the television ... Breakfast was set out for us in an impressive way, but again I was disappointed by certain limitations. It was expensive and I felt that the value for money was not there. Finally the bedrooms overlooking Avda Diagonal were too noisy.",4,2015,04,15
53,EXCELLENT IN ALL ASPECTS,I have no words! Everything was perfect. Especially the ladies at the reception. Very helpful in everything. The appartment is perfect and the location as well. If you can afford it just don't search any other place.,5,2015,04,14
53,Best birthday!!,"We came in for a long weekend... After researching for some of the best hotels I found this one. In the past I've always felt that places look better in pictures... However here everything was even more amazing in person. Attention to detail, as a designer I was amazed! The staff in the hotel are all sweet and amazing, always going out of the way to offer help. Best was receiving a sweet treat for my birthday! Loved it!!!",5,2015,04,13
53,Excellent as usual,Service and stay excellent as usual its great to wake up in the morning and have someone there who is cooking you breakfast. It is perfect for children also but i would recomend with very young children to not choose the passige de gracia rooms just incase there is more noise than usual at night. However my children had no problems (aged 2 & 4) but just incase that worries you. Only thing that needs improvement is to just re-wire the TV by the looks of things to make sure it works correctly and maybe even add an appleTV etc if possible.,4,2015,02,02
53,Great Barcelona Escape,"We stayed for 2 nights from 1st-2nd January, as soon as we arrived, everyone wishedwe had more time. The building is well located in the high end fashion area and carries the Gaudi architecture throughout in all details. We luckily had our room upgraded due to limited availability, the two bedroom two bathroom apartment which was great for family and two couples to be able to stay together and still have privacy.

We arrived late in the evening and were welcomed by the doorman who showed as how to operate everything and the kitchen is filled with sufficient wine and food to relax and take in the surroundings.

In the weeks leading up to our arrival concierge were able to assist with reservations and make recommendations for our stay and in the day or so before our arrival reconfirmed all details and ensured we had transport, the small bit of service really makes a difference.
I have visited Barcelona a few times and stayed in hotels, but nothing compares to this place, 
really made this trip unforgettable.",5,2015,01,30
53,Luxury and Comfort,"We stayed for seven nights at El Palauet from December 28-January 5, 2015.  The location is incredible in the Gracia area.  We walked to wonderful restaurants and the designer shopping was amazing.  Also, the El Palauet was within brief walking distance of two Gaudi masterpieces.  We had a two bedroom/two bath apartment which we shared with our two sons.   A beautiful living room, enormous dining room and ample kitchen completed the apartment.  It was wonderfully furnished.  While this is a older building (and a wonderfully historic one), every aspect of the apartment was 100% modern in the bath and kitchen areas.  We have stayed at some grand hotels, but El Palauet may top the list for space, convenience, and location!  Also, I must add that the staff is amazing.  We asked them to make several dining reservations and their help was fabulous.  One final note -- the wifi was wonderful and flawless!",5,2015,01,06
53,Much more than an apartment...,"Stylish and beautiful, agree with the other reviewers, if you want to stay in the town rather than the beach the location is perfect, it's in the heart of the Bond St/5th Avenue of Barcelona. We didn't use the concierge much but their restaurant tips were excellent. The size of the apartments is very generous, I was travelling with my wife and our 2 teenage kids and we had ample space to lounge around in the living room. The furniture is all high-end designer, combined with the amazing architecture of the building the look is stunning!",5,2015,01,05
53,best place to stay!,Stayed here over xmas break and was perfect!  looked at many different options and so happy we chose this one.  Amazing building in the best location with the best staff.  The building is so beautiful and really added to our experience of modernism in Barcelona.  So much space and wonderful decor.  I highly recommend this hotel. Staff are great - Nadia was so wonderful always with a smile on her face. Elisabeth also was so helpful and sweet.,5,2015,01,03
53,Style with Soul,"We just returned from five unforgettable nights in El Palauet in Barcelona. This is one of the most spectacular places that we have ever stayed and ranks in my top three anywhere in the world. We were three adults and two children and we stayed in a two bedroom suite abundant with light and space. It is one of the most high tech places with every gadget imaginable. There is nothing that has not been thought of in these rooms from the beautiful couches, modern functional tables, comfortable leather chairs, and stunning mirrors. The light fittings were more like pieces of art than mere objects of light. Everything was selected with style and design in mind from the mirrors to the cutlery to the linens to the bathroom fixtures. The windows allowed a seamless integration of the inside and outside world and yet we had complete privacy. This place has it all. 

Yet with all the high tech, it is still very high touch. Everyone who works for El Palauet was dedicated to making our stay memorable and nothing seemed too much for them from the unbelievable tickets to the Barcelona Game, to reservations at the best restaurants. Everyone showed real care for us and genuinely wanted us to have the time of our lives and we did, so much so that Barcelona is our new favorite city in Europe. Everyone was so helpful but ask for Lorna and Silvia if you need something extra special. Mark is very hands on and another wonderful girl whose name escapes me. Sorry! The only way it was possible for us to leave was to make a reservation for the same time in 2015. We cannot wait!",5,2014,12,01
53,Beautiful modernisme building,"We stayed for 5 nights in a two bedroom apartment in he the attic level. The building is beautiful and the rooms were well appointed and staff delightful and helpful. Very good central location on passeig de Gracia, excellent nearby restaurants and metro.",5,2014,09,24
53,Grand accommodation,"We had the atic suite, exceptionally large and luxurious. The suite had all the mod cons and a balcony. The top deck has a plunge pool and wonderful views over Barcelona. The staff are excellent , especially Nadia.",5,2014,09,16
53,Great Hotel,An outstanding hotel in a great location. Only six two bedroom suites in a renovated Modernist building. The spacious suites are decorated in modern fashion and have sleek bathrooms and  kitchen as well as a dining room. Because of the small size we felt like we were the only guests and had our own apartment. Remember to go to the rooftop terrace to enjoy the view and use the hot tub! The staff was very helpful in all requests and speak English. Cannot wait to return.,5,2014,03,19
53,True Xmas Experience,"I stayed in El Palauet in December 2010, but from what I experienced, I will never forget it. The staff were so helpful, down-to-earth, funny and have a good level of English; which is always comforting. We had two rooms and the design and decor was unbelievably stylish. It was always so comforting to go around shopping and sight-seeing around Barcelona and then to go back in relax in El Palauet. Can not recommend this place enough. Next time I am in Barcelona.... there is only one place I am staying!",5,2014,01,25
53,Priceless,"El Palauet is nothing but absolutely elegant luxury living at the end of the sophisticated Passeig de Gracia. Close enough to all the designer shopping, but far enough for some peace and quiet. The staff are extremely friendly and are always there for anything you need...yet remaining quietly hidden to ensure your privacy.

The suite we stayed in combined the grandeur of the modernist building, wonderful ceilings and space...and combined it with the very best of modern conveniences that luxury has to offer. Music that can be controlled from any of the rooms (the collection is expansive and there's something for every mood), the in-house ipad that let you control everything from lights to the television (and of course, you could use it to browse the Internet too!), the chromatherapy shower, large bathtubs in both the bathrooms, and a well-stocked kitchen with every convenience you can think of. Add to this, a large selection of wines and cava inside your room.

The suite was so large and spacious, you could get lost. Immensely comfortable beds in both bedrooms, each paired with a walk-in closet. A separate dining area that matched the kitchen alongside. And a ver large, comfortable living room that connected all the rooms.

Every little nook and corner of El Palauet Living Barcelona is designed to pamper. The price is well worth it, and we know we will be back there the next time we're in Barcelona!",5,2014,01,11
53,"Great hotel, great location","This is a fantastic hotel in a great area of Barcelona.  The two bedroom suite was outstanding in comfort and style and quiet too.  The team that run the hotel are always on hand to help with any query, booking or recommendation and they are all so discreet.

53,Breathtakingly Beautiful,"I was beginning to give up, I had been searching for suitable 'special' accommodation for myself and my family to celebrate my 40th birthday in Barcelona, and then I stumbled across El Palauet. Wow, what an amazing place, the staff are fantastic, the apartments are beautiful and so spacious. My jaw dropped when we arrived, it really is that special! The location is very central, and if you like designer shopping you will be in heaven! Barcelona is as lovely as always, the weather was fantastic.......I totally recommend El Palauet, the only problem will be, like us, you won't want to leave!",5,2013,10,28
53,wonderful place,"My family and I vacationed in Barcelona for 7 days and stayed at El Palauet, what a wonderful hotel. The 2 bedroom suite was beautifully furnished with state of the art technology and decor. The staff was outstanding, arraigning trips and restaurant reservations for us. I would recommend El Palauet for anyone traveling to Barcelona.

Great Trip",5,2013,08,21
53,WOW FACTOR +,"We were in Barcelona for a friend's birthday and wanted to stay somewhere special to celebrate.  After what felt like an exhaustive search trying to find accommodation with two-bedroom apartments, an angel smiled upon us and guided us to El Palauet.  What a find.

If, like us, you've always fantasised of living in a multi-million dollar apartment (but aren't quite there yet) then this is the place to come and live the dream (if only for a couple of nights).  We didn't want to leave.  We maybe spent 8 hours outside our hotel over the course of our two night stay.  The rest we spent inside soaking in all the apartment's treasures (except for the sound system, which wasn't working.  Lucky we brought our own).  

This was easily the most upmarket place we stayed in over the course of our two month European trip and we arrived at El Palauet with high expectations for our stay.  We left feeling that not only had our expectations been met, but exceeded.",5,2013,08,03
53,Highlight of a birthday weekend,"My friends and I have been travelling through Europe at the same time but only meeting up for a couple of occasions in a 10-week period. It was my birthday this previous weekend and decided to meet in Barcelona and splurge. One of the things we found difficult to find was a hotel in Barcelona that had two separate bedrooms as opposed to one bedroom and fold-out bed. 

The hotel itself is stunning. Everything is lush. They have the most amazing lighting in the rooms, included walls and furniture that have backlighting I them that just add the most incredible touch. The bathrooms are incredible with Roca fixtures including a colour therapy shower and a Japanese electric toilet which ensures that EVERYTHING is clean after you finish. 

Before we arrived, they asked if there was anything we wanted in the room. I have a mild addiction to Perrier, so was absolutely stoked when they were able to fulfil my request for about 2 litres of Perrier in the fridge. All of the staff were amazing. They provided a lot of information about the area. We had requested information about boat trips around Barcelona (which we didn't end up using) but they were all thoroughly researched with a variety of different options. 

And, to top it off, they had a birthday card waiting for me with balloons! When I return to Barcelona, I will definitely staying there again. ",5,2013,07,22
53,Fantastic!,"We (family of four) just finished a two week trip to Spain and Morocco with a one night layover in Barcelona at the El Palauet. I don't often experience ""hotel envy""  (as in, I wish I could stay in this room longer), but we certainly did at the El Palauet.  Housed in a fabulous turn of the century building on the Passeig de Gracia (the Madison Avenue of Barcelona), the common areas are stunning.  The rooms are even more fantastic--soaring, gorgeously restored ceilings; chic furnishings; state of the art systems.  We loved every bit of it--the butler service, the attentiveness of all of the staff (one of whom came to our room at 6:00 a.m. on the day of our departure to prepare breakfast!).  Thank you El Palauet (Lorna and Alex!).  We can't wait to return, for a longer stay!",5,2013,07,08
53,Excellent Hotel,"Electronic Features not Working. [Music]. 
They should update the music and electronic system.
Car Parking/Service not available, but Public Parking available 24H.
They should propose Voiturier service.
Everything else is just Excellent.

53,Super & Stylish,"This was a really nice find- thank you trip advisor! Well, where shall I start? The apartments are kept clean, the interior is very much French- Dramatic style and the location is quite good- about 20 minutes walk to the center. Me & my boyfriend had a very pleasant weekend living in a very chic place. Thank you!",5,2013,05,03
53,Beautiful property in excellent location,"El Palauet is high quality accommodation in a very good location. The staff are extremely friendly and helpful. It is in the main shopping area and about a 30 min walk from the Gothic Quarter. The apartments are very high spec and there is a range of food and drink, including good wine, to buy in the kitchen. My one criticism is that design has trumped practicality particularly in the bathrooms where the modern sink fittings shoot water onto you and the bath takes a good 30 minutes to fill. Also the toilet has a glass, sliding door within the door-less en-suite bathroom which won't suit everyone.",4,2013,02,19
53,50th Birthday Party,"I have just got back from Barcelona where I had an utter blast at Residence El Palauet who organised my 50th birthday party there. We took over the whole place for the weekend and they could not have been more helpful. The decor (with many additional touches brought in specially for the event, like carvel flowers, enormous balloons, a jazz band, Spanish guitarist, etc. etc.) is stunning and it is a truly magic place. The staff are exceptional.
For sure, all of this comes at a (hefty) price but, if ever you can, do try it out. The ""rooms"" (really they are 2-bedroom apartments) are huge and extremely comfortable. It's real 100% luxury staying there. 
It was all top class.",5,2013,01,24
53,unforgettable vacation,"Our family (2 adult + 2 children) spent unforgettable New Years holidays in El Palauet Living Barcelona. It was absolutely unusual and exclusive experience for us. First of all we would like to thank all team of this hotel especially Nolia and Alex for unique and incredible rest. Everything was surprising in this hotel, since an execellent combination of blending classic and latest tecnology in our suite and finishing our personal assistant who made for us a breakfast in our fully stocked kitchen while we were in beds. The location of this hotel was spotless - walkable to tons of shopping and not too far from Las Ramblas.  So, if you want to be in hotel with excellent service, modern equipment, a convenient location and the same time to feel as at home, visit this hotel. Definitely staying again. Yuriy, Oksana.",5,2013,01,19
53,"Great Location, spotless apt","Location, location, location one of the best in BCN.  The personal concierge was extremely helpful and nice.  The apt was hi tech and beautifully decorated, good AC, wonderful sound proofing and nice amenities. Spotless.  Extremely friendly staff",5,2013,01,09
53,"Beautiful, sophisticated and comfortable",Our experience at El Palauet was fantastic. The service was impeccable and the suite came equipped with state-of-the-art facilities. Its location in the centre grants easy access to many notable sites and is convenient. Most impressive however was the beautiful design/architecture of the building. We really could not find any fault - a truly special hotel.,5,2013,01,07
53,Spotless!,"One of the best hotels ever! Everything from reception on arrival, to the personal sevice during our stay. It feels like you are at home, but with their own butler. Order a big breakfast, and they will come and cook it in your kitchen and serve it on the dining table while you are still in bed. I can rally recommend El Palauet!",5,2012,12,27
53,Unique and Special Experience,"We recently attended a family destination wedding in Barcelona.  My husband and two grown daughters came on the trip.  We were so fortunate to have found this unique  boutique hotel  El Palauet Living Barcelona.  We all have never been to Barcelona before so we didn't know what to expect. There were so many choices of 5 star hotels in this location, but we wanted a unique family trip were we could all be together.  Le Palauet was spectacular.  We were so impressed with the whole experience from the building's heritage and unique architecture to the stylish decor and fantastic location, but the best of all were the incredible staff who looked after us and make our trip so memorable.  We will never forget the incredible trip and the wonderful people we met.  We cannot wait to go back to El Palauet Living Barcelona.  We all thank you for your wonderfu hospitality... The Al-Sahhaf Family",5,2012,12,22
53,Amazing Experience,"Wonderful experience and amazing hospitality. The staff are very helpful and the property offers any service you may need. The location is in the best part of the city where the luxury shopping is located. The building and the suites are equipped  with high-tech systems that serves in every way. And last but not least the decor and furniture of the entire property were beyond beautiful.
We had two suites and requested to have them on the same floor and the person who was in charge of our booking made sure that our request was met and we had the floor to ourselves.",5,2012,11,26
53,One of a Kind Boutique Hotel,"Our family of 4 visited El Palauet this summer and had a wonderful experience. The service was truly extraordinary!! The history and detail in the hotel and the rooms are breathtaking. The only suggestion I can make, include free coffee pods with the stay. The location is central to shopping and an easy cab ride to the beach. Definitely staying again.",5,2012,11,26
53,Great weekend at El Palauet,"Our experience at El Palauet was definitely special. Firstly, the location of the hotel is superb as it is on the main shopping street of Barcelona - passage de gracia. One can also easily walk to the touristy La Ramba (10 minute walk).

We stayed in the 2 bedroom suite and were very happy with the suite - rooms were big, kitchen was stocked with food items, cutlery and the living room was comfortable. The suite was very modern and everything was automated (including the Japanese toilet seats). The only small issue that we had in our suite was that the room safe was not operational. 

The best part of the hotel has to be the service though. As soon as you enter, the staff especially Jana made us feel right at home. What was truly remarkable was that they managed to arrange superb tickets for us for the Barcelona - Real Madrid football game just 2 days before the game. They were very helpful in all other matters as well, going out of their way to make sure we were satisfied with our stay in Barcelona.
 
 We would definitely be coming back to El Palauet next time in Barcelona.",5,2012,10,15
53,A truly unforgettable experience,"El Palauet has to be experienced to be truly believed. The moment you walk through the doors, you immediately realize you have entered into a unique place.  The d√©cor is absolutely breathtaking, from the entrance lobby, to the elevator and, of course, the suites. The suites are truly stunning. You will find yourself just staring at the ornate ceilings and you will be in true amazement of the shear beauty. The suites are spacious, very clean and have a fully stocked kitchen. Everything has been thought of, from the lighting design (via control panels), to the privacy that the suite provides. The suites and decor isn't the only aspect that is of premier quality‚Ä¶ the personal service that you experience is world-class. Upon arrival, my wife and I and our two small children (4 and 9), were made so welcome by our wonderful personal assistant, Nuria. We immediately felt like we were part of the El Palauet family. Location is perfect, with easy access to restaurants, bars and the Metro. We were sad to leave, but we now know that if we find ourselves in Barcelona again, there is ONLY ONE place to stay‚Ä¶ El Palauet Living Barcelona.",5,2012,07,13
53,Very nice hotel with very nice people !,"The Hotel is very nice ! We had the 2 suites on the same floor so we had all the floor for us ! It's very nice if you are with friends. Large rooms (2 bedrooms per suite) with all the things you need !
If you like technology like I am, you will love it !
The design and the details are well done !

53,Gorgeous Modernista Apartment,"Great location, luxurious accommodation with so much space and really helpful staff. Will definitely go back.",5,2012,05,22
53,Staying here was a dream,We stayed here on a business trip and found the hotel to be an absolute gem. The location was perfect...walkable to tons of shopping and not too far from Las Ramblas. The suite we stayed in had a fully stocked kitchen and we were greeted every morning with an in-room cooked breakfast from our personal assistant.  Anything we needed was cheerfully and quickly provided by the staff at any time. We even had in-room pedicures and then a massage on the beautiful roof top spa (which was probably one of the best massages I've had in a long time).  Thank you to El Palauet's staff for making our trip an amazing experience.  We will be back!,5,2012,02,29
53,This place is rockstar good.,"It is rare when you see cool photos of a hotel room and then arrive and find that the rooms actually are better than the pictures.  El Palauet is such a place.  I can't believe the fit and finish of the entire apartment, it is like a magazine photo shoot.  I couldn't stop staring at the ceilings, the moldings, the windows, and every square inch has been well thought out -- down to the fully-stocked, full-size refrigerator.  The dramatic lighting scheme and automation takes it over the top.  This is one of the nicest places I've stayed. The apartment experience really made my stay exceptional, way beyond any hotel.  I actually found myself looking forward to heading back to apartment after a day traipsing around Barcelona.

The service level is beyond even the top hotels I've stayed in.  Alex and Nuria were not only extremely helpful, but friendly and genuine and truly made the experience special.  The in-suite breakfast is over the top good.  The entire staff made it feel like you are staying in their home.  Truly exceptional place.  The location is also perfect.",5,2012,01,03
53,Modern design hotel,"Great design, spacious apartments and very high tech.  The service though is not hotel-standard, though understandable due to there only being 6 ""rooms"" which in reality are 2 bedroom apartments.  While the high design is unique and the location is great, some of the quirks quickly become annoying such as an elevator that would constantly get stuck due to the double door system (if a guest forgets to close either inner or outer door, you have to go to that floor and close it before the elevator can move again) and the ceiling mirrors on top of the showers, where from the entrance foyer you can see people taking a shower.

The ""personal assistant"", while I felt was trying his best, wasn't great with English and was fairly hard to get in touch with.  This is more a place to stay if you're familiar with the city and don't need any hotel services (room service or business services for example - no one picked up over the course of an hour when we were trying to order room service and mailing a letter entailed walking to the nearest post office).",3,2011,09,10
53,Hidden Gem,"A very nice experience.  Rooms were surprising spacious and ultra-modern.
Staff could not have tried harder to help and to please.  Quaint elevator and secret rooftop oasis that is beyond belief.  My family and I loved this place.",4,2011,08,23
53,"Your own private, personal ultra-spacious high-luxury hotel suite that you will return to.","This  is one of the most t superb and memorable hotels of my many years of privileged travel experiences worldwide:  El Palauet Living Barcelona. It is more than a hotel because it is a destination experience in itself, living in Barcelona as an insider, not like being in a hotel.   El Palauet (it means ‚Äúlittle palace‚Äù in the Catalan language)  has only six suites, and they are immense, each with two bedrooms, two baths, a huge living room, separate sitting/office area-- I loved the complimentary broadband wi-fi and sat at my desk happily writing on my laptop. I had a full kitchen, completely equipped, all utensils, appliances, modern and high-Europe-design accoutrements, and a full dining room.  I had the luxury of what they call a ‚Äúpersonal assistant‚Äù, more than a butler or valet, at my service 24/7. Johnny, his name, told me about this exquisite mondernista (Catalan version of art nouveau) building built in 1906 by a famed architect contemporary to the great Antoni Gaudi (whom you should Google) whose imaginative and undulating buildings are just down the street. Gaudi is most known for Barcelona‚Äôs iconic Sagrada Familia. Johnny cooked my breakfast which was lavish and included eggs Catalan style, delicious and even with a unique ‚Äúdesign‚Äù (I later learned he studied with one of Catalonia‚Äôs most celebrated chefs.) He also instructed me -- and instruction is a must -- how to operate the touch-screen ‚Äúroom intelligence‚Äù controls for climate control, music (great selection, and because there re many many high- quality speakers, I better enjoyed the music rich in quality while low in volume), also controls for the automatic curtains on the vast picture windows.
 Bathrooms have gigantic ‚Äúwaterfall‚Äù showerheads, and the master bathroom is complimented by an additional room containing a big bathtub where the highlight is chromatherapy ... a progression of every color in the spectrum changing seamlessly and almost mesmerizing and relaxing in that room.  Most memorable for me was the ‚ÄúJapanese style‚Äù combination toilet-bidet,  I must say a high-tech human-friendly ‚Äúluxury‚Äù even for that particular activity, hygienic, refreshing, paper-free, and hands free. Although not necessary, there were generous rolls of toilet paper. 
The elaborate original modernism design -- elaborately carved ceiling adornments and decor -- were  either perfectly preserved or perfectly restored.  Special high-tech non-porous surfaces, in the kitchen counters and other tabletop surfaces are industrial strength yet soft to touch and highly clean, in creams and other warm colors. Embedded within these surfaces are subtly illuminated vignette designs that mimic the original patters on the walls and ceilings from over a hundred years ago. As if there were a conversation between them.
Hence the most ultra modern comforts -- and i really mean Comforts -- mingle within the authentic atmosphere and aesthetic of this treasured modernism period building
Yes, staying here I felt I was experiencing Barcelona from the ‚Äúinside‚Äù.  And with Johnny‚Äôs orientation even more so.  
I exit my suite through my stalwart front door, stepped into my own marble foyer and into the antique elevator, perfectly restored, yet another ‚Äúliving experience‚Äù. Then out the almost private entry hallway , out the massive antique wood front door and, as i stepped onto the sidewalk of Passeig de Gracia, i knew i was exactly where I was supposed to be in Barcelona.  (You encounter no lobby while entering or leaving...a drawing room set off from the entry hall, is where you register while relaxing on a sofa enjoying, a welcome drink and tapa, and reviewing your ‚Äúguest profile and preferences‚Äù that you had sent via email .)
This is the charming neighborhood where the swank Passeig de Gracia (a tree-lined avenue often compared to New York‚Äôs (less lovely) Fifth Avenue, becomes much narrower as it crosses the major intersection of Avinguda Diagonal and  morfs into a lovely tranquil street with a neighborhood ambiance and a garden-parkway with trees and statuary in the center. 
 Jimmy oriented me and accompanied me for a short walk pointing out some favorite shops, restaurants and patisseries (of course he could order anything I wish and bring it and serve in my room). At the same time he is admirably knowledgeable about history, architecture, cuisines and generously  shared his knowledge in a way that was more meaningful to me as a visitor.
I stayed three nights with my partner, and with all the sightseeing, concerts and museums, we were always drawn back to our suite because we felt we were missing something by not being there. Additionally, we enjoyed going up to the private garden rooftop to use the open-air jacuzzi, Finnish sauna, have a massage in the spa area, then simply rest and have a drink in the quiet al fresco lounging area designed specifically for that purpose.
We will be returning to EL Palauet, and are considering combining a future stay there both before and after a Mediterranean Cruise out of Barcelona. Either way, I fell El Palauet is not a place to stay just one time, and to me it IS Barcelona.",5,2011,06,16
53,Comida de boda de 12 comensales,"Desde que ha sido comprado este a√±o por otros due√±os no le auguro buen futuro. El trato de la directora del hotel conmigo fue lamentable y poco profesional. Alquil√© una de las salas para una comida de 12 personas para celebrar nuestra boda en este mes de Octubre y tras haber realizado el pago, contratado el catering, el fot√≥grafo etc... me cancelaron la reserva  dos dias antes aludiendo que estaban convencidos de que la generalitat iba a declarar el confinamiento domiciliario, cosa q como bien se sabe nunca se llev√≥ a cabo. La sala contratada era para 90 personas, ibamos a ser 12, todos familia, en dos mesas separadas  de 6 personas donde tb cont√°bamos con una terraza, y medidas para poder mantener las distancias y medidas de seguridad indicadas, pero ni siquiera tuve la opci√≥n de hablar con la RRPP del hotel con quien habia gestionado todo el evento porq decidi√≥ no ponerse al tel√©fono ni darme una explicaci√≥n coherente. Personalmente no recomiendo jugarse un evento tan especial con este tipo de equipo, donde la empatia brilla por su ausencia. S√≥lo ped√≠ q alguien me explicara de una manera l√≥gica los motivos de no poder celebrar mi boda en ese sitio, 48 horas antes de casarme. Gracias a Dios no tuvimos problema para encontrar en 24h otro hotel que nos permitiera con garant√≠as la celebraci√≥n de la Boda, nos tratara mucho mejor y q no nos pusiera ning√∫n tipo de excusa para cancelar de forma unilateral la reserva que con ellos ten√≠a desde hac√≠a semanas.",1,2020,11,04
53,Fant√°stico,"Uno de los lugares m√°s acogedores y especiales en los que he estado. El apartamento es espectacular desde todos los puntos de vista. Solo la pantalla de cristal para el ca√±√≥n de imagen, ya impresiona, las vidrieras modernistas, la ba√±era Philipp Starck en la galer√≠a con color terapia, el inodoro japon√©s, la dom√≥tica, la decoraci√≥n, la ubicaci√≥n, el edificio (IMPRESIONANTE) , el servicio personalizado con atenci√≥n 24 horas, el roof con piscina... sin palabras!

53,Otro de los buenos edificios,"Paseando por el Passeig de Gracia admirando los edificios modernistas nos encontramos muchos que son muy bonitos, por que no todo se termina con la Casa Batll√≥ y La Pedrera. Este edificio es un proyecto de Pere Falqu√©s i Urp√≠ y se termin√≥ en el a√±o 1906.

53,Bel soggiorno,"Bella location in zona strategica. Tutto molto moderno. L'aspetto pi√π positivo il fatto che si ha la comodit√† dell'albergo (servizi di pulizia) accompagnati dalla comodit√† di una casa, con cucina super attrezzata, sala da pranzo e salotto. Volendo si pu√≤ ordinare la colazione/pranzo/cena direttamente a casa, dove viene un cuoco a cucinare direttamente a casa, apparecchiando e sistemando tutto dopo aver mangiato. Un po' cari questi servizi aggiuntivi, ma anche molto comodi. Lo staff a volte un po' disorganizzato (non si coordinano sempre al massimo tra di loro, pur essendo sempre gentili e disponibili). L'albergo ha poche stanze (6 appartamenti), a garanzia di tranquillit√† e silenzio. Lo suggerisco",4,2017,01,16
53,Frustrados ,"

Somos un matrimonio de Barcelona, que escogi√≥ el Palauet, para disfrutar dos noches en un edificio emblem√°tico de la ciudad de Barcelona en las fiestas de Reyes.
Desgraciadamente nuestras expectativas no se cumplieron, la categor√≠a del edificio y de sus instalaciones que reconocemos espl√©ndidas, distan mucho del nivel profesional del servicio que se ocupa de gestionarlo.
Profesionales que denominan a la Direcci√≥n o la Propiedad como ‚Äúla due√±a‚Äù, es s√≥lo un peque√±o indicador de lo que vendr√≠a despu√©s, un c√∫mulo de desprop√≥sitos del servicio y la direcci√≥n que deseamos compartir:
La primera tarde, d√≠a 4 de enero, aparece una plaga de hormigas en el ba√±o de nuestra habitaci√≥n, que solucionan de manera temporal, excusando con ‚Äúel edificio de al lado est√° cerrado y es lo que pasa‚Ä¶‚Äù, por lo que sab√≠an que esto sucedida. Esto se compensa con un sencillo plato de pan con tomate y queso, ah y algo de jam√≥n.
Al d√≠a siguiente por la noche, el 5 de enero, cuando volvemos a la habitaci√≥n nos encontramos de nuevo con la plaga de hormigas, pedimos soluciones, y la √∫nica que nos dan es que cambiemos de cama en nuestra propia habitaci√≥n, ya que dispon√≠a de dos espacios, que hablar√°n con la ‚Äúdue√±a‚Äù para ver que se puede hacer y c√≥mo se puede compensar. Por cierto, la persona de recepci√≥n no tiene otra brillante idea que llamar a la puerta a la una de la madrugada para limpiar las famosas hormigas, cosa que hizo. Todav√≠a me pregunto c√≥mo la dejamos pasar.
Llegamos al d√≠a 6, nuestra salida, nadie hasta el momento nos ha indicado nada al respecto, cuando preguntamos en recepci√≥n si sab√≠an lo que hab√≠a sucedido, parece ser que no, ya que tuvimos que explicar de nuevo lo sucedido, y de nuevo indican que llaman a la ‚Äúdue√±a‚Äù para ver c√≥mo arreglarlo. 
Salimos a desayunar fuera del hotel, y a la vuelta nos indican que nos hab√≠an dejado una fruta para desayunar, pero como la puerta estaba cerrada no llamaron, inaudito cuando nos han visto salir a desayunar y hemos dejado las maletas en la recepci√≥n.
La gota que colma el vaso es cuando, despu√©s de indicar la situaci√≥n a cuatro diferentes personas del servicio, por fin contactan con la ‚Äúdue√±a‚Äù y que la compensaci√≥n por haber arruinado dos noches, que esperamos fant√°sticas, el coste que tiene, y el espacio de un edificio s√≥lo para 6 habitaciones, es de 9,90 ‚Ç¨ que ten√≠amos que abonar por un agua y las tasas tur√≠sticas, ya que previamente la habitaci√≥n hab√≠a sido pagada.
Nos pareci√≥ una aut√©ntica ‚Äútomadura de pelo‚Äù, que evidentemente no aceptamos.
Bueno esto es todo, desde la tranquilidad de haberlo compartido varios d√≠as despu√©s, para as√≠ sosegar los √°nimos.
En resumen, el t√≠pico negocio en el que se invierte todo en el local, dirigido por personas que no entienden del negocio ni de los clientes, acompa√±ado de un equipo de personas que no tienen culpa por no haber sido formados a la altura del hotel que representan. NO VOLVEREMOS M√ÅS, NI POR SUPUESTO LO RECOMENDAREMOS.

- Es todo enorme, tanto los ba√±os, el sal√≥n, la zona de la cocina donde te ponen el desayuno por la ma√±ana (entran a la hora que les digas, te lo dejan y se marchan y ni te enteras, os recomiendo el desayuno continental).....

53,Una experiencia inolvidable,"Ha sido como entrar en un lugar magico que te transporta al Modernismo Catala, y a la vez disfrutar de toda la comodidad y elegancia de una decoraci√≥n integrada al ambiente.
El espacio es estupendo, confortable y relajante ya que cuenta con dos suites, un amplio sal√≥n y una cocina equipada a medida de las necesidades de quienes les gusta disfrutar ""en casa"" de una buena comida o cena. 
Yo especialmente he probado el ba√±o de imersi√≥n, una delicia! 
Pero el punto fuerte y lo que m√°s me ha impactado ha sido el servicio, impecable, del personal assistant que hace con que la instancia en este hotel sea casi como en ""tu casa"" con la diferencia que esta mejor que all√≠ ya que puedes disfrutar de todo un luxo en atencion personal, desde el primero instante, hasta el final...Verdaderamente una experiencia inolvidable y a repetirse!!!",5,2011,06,27
